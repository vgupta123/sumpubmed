BACKGROUND
diols are of great importance in the manufacture of plastics and polyurethanes, which have molded our society in many ways that make our life much easier  <cit> . the biosynthesis of short-chain diols such as  <dig> -propanediol and  <dig> -butanediol has been well developed , while the long-chain α, ω-diols such as  <dig> -tetradecanediol and  <dig> -hexadecanediol can be made by the catalytic hydrogenation of long-chain dicarboxylate esters. the medium-chain diols with one subterminal hydroxyl group, for example,  <dig> -decanediol, which confer more flexibility upon the synthesized materials, are promising monomers for the synthesis of polymers with better properties. but unfortunately, this type of diols has not yet been synthesized with either chemical or biological method. the strong market demand for new polymers drives us to develop a strategy for the synthesis of these diols.

to obtain the carbon backbones, we paid attention to the straight-chain fatty alcohols, whose biosynthesis has been well developed in recent years . to finally get the desired diols, an additional hydroxyl group needs to be added to the subterminal carbon of the monohydric alcohols. but it is too difficult for the inorganic catalysts to catalyze the oxidation of a specific subterminal carbon of the monohydric alcohols, as each of the subterminal carbons almost has the same chemical contexts, and the inorganic catalysts usually exhibit poor selectivity. so the biocatalyst was considered as a priority. in seeking such a biocatalyst for the conversion of monohydric alcohols to corresponding diols, p450bm <dig> seems to be a promising enzyme, which naturally catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acids to corresponding hydroxyfatty acids  <cit> . p450bm <dig> is highly soluble in cytosolic environment, and has high catalytic rates and expression level in engineered e. coli, which is the most widely used host for the bioproduction of chemicals  <cit> . these advantages make it an ideal biocatalyst for biotechnological application. and more importantly, its variants have shown to be able to utilize a wide range of other substrates. the p450bm <dig> variant 35-e <dig>  whose  <dig> amino acid residues were substituted, was found to be capable of converting ethane to ethanol  <cit> , and a series of p450bm <dig> variants were reported the improved activities on non-natural substrates naphthalene, pentane, p-cymene and propylbenzene  <cit> . these findings suggest that p450bm <dig> has stunning flexibility in substrate preference. in addition, protein engineering has been widely used as a strategy in the biological production of chemicals  <cit> . therefore, an improved regioselectivity for alcohol hydroxylation at ω- <dig> position can be expected by remodeled p450bm <dig> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the substrate specificities and regioselectivities of the native p450bm <dig> and the remodeled p450bm <dig>  the native p450bm <dig> has a substrate preference for c12-c <dig> fatty acids and evenly oxidizes the ω- <dig>  ω- <dig> and ω- <dig> carbons of the fatty acid substrates , while the remodeled p450bm <dig> exhibits a greatly improved regiospecificity of decanol hydroxylation, with  <dig> -decanediol as the dominant product 



in this study, we are reporting a strategy for high-specificity synthesis of α, ω3-diols from renewable medium-chain fatty alcohols. to improve the regioselectivity for alcohol hydroxylation at ω- <dig> position, we generated a series of p450bm <dig> variants by laboratory evolution. we also identified several key amino acid residues that control the regioselectivity of alcohol hydroxylation, and discussed the reason why these residues play a key role in determining the regioselectivity by structural analysis.

RESULTS
substrate specificity and regioselectivity of p450bm3
the p450bm <dig> was chosen as the starting enzyme for the conversion of alcohols to diols. so the engineered e. coli that overexpresses the native p450bm <dig> was constructed as the biocatalyst to test p450bm3’s ability of alcohol hydroxylation. the heptanol and decanol were firstly used as the substrates for testing the activity of p450bm <dig>  as the medium chain diols are of more interests for the development of new polymers. p450bm <dig> exhibited high activities towards these substrates and produced almost an equivalent amount of α, ω1-, α, ω2- and α, ω3-diols, exhibiting the same regioselectivity as its native fatty acid substrates . but when using pentanol as the substrate, only a tiny amount of  <dig> -pentanediol was obtained , suggesting p450bm <dig> has a different regioselectivity for short-chain alcohols. no activity was observed when using propanol and butanol as the substrates.fig.  <dig> gc-ms analysis of diols in the cultures. when pentanol was used as substrate, both bm <dig> and bm3j produced  <dig> -pentanediol as the only product . when heptanol and decanol were used as substrates, bm3j produced much more  <dig> -heptanediol  and  <dig> -decanediol  than bm <dig>  respectively

fig.  <dig> regiospecificities of the native p450bm <dig>  p450bm3j and corresponding  <dig> single mutants of p450bm3j. decanol was used as the substrate, and  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -decanediols were analyzed by gc-ms. the ratio of  <dig> -decanediol to total decanediols increased from  <dig>  % in bm <dig> to ~50 % in r255s, suggesting the increased ratio of  <dig> -decanediol to total decanediols in bm3j is mainly attributed to the substitution of arg <dig> to ser <dig>  the other  <dig> amino acid substitutions may have a combined effect on the constriction of the substrate-binding channel and the change of the substrate orientation



as the typical substrates of p450bm <dig> are long-chain fatty acids  <cit> , it is not surprising that the short-chain fatty alcohols are poor substrates for p450bm <dig>  arg <dig> and tyr <dig> were thought to interact with the carboxylate group of the fatty acid substrates  <cit> . our finding that p450bm <dig> is also capable of utilizing fatty alcohols demonstrates that the interaction between arg47/tyr <dig> and carboxylate group is not so strong, and arg47/tyr <dig> is not involved in determining the substrate specificity of p450bm <dig>  if arg47/tyr <dig> is responsible for stabilizing the carboxylate group of the fatty acid substrates, the carboxylate group needs to be recognized by the two amino acid residues, and p450bm <dig> will not be able to oxidize those hydrocarbons without carboxylate group. therefore, the size of the substrate-binding pocket plays an important role in determining the substrate specificity of p450bm <dig>  given that the p450bm <dig> has no activity towards short-chain alcohols and alkanes  <cit> .

substrate specificity and regioselectivity of p450bm3j
for the high-specificity production of the α, ω3-diols, the native p450bm <dig> needs to be modified to change its regioselectivity for alcohol hydroxylation. the regioselectivity is connected with the substrate orientation, which could be changed when the substrate channel of p450bm <dig> is constrained. it was found that a p450bm <dig> variant , which contains  <dig> amino acid substitutions  with respect to the native p450bm <dig>  changed its substrate preferences for shorter alkanes  when compared with the native p450bm <dig>  which exhibited a substrate preference for cn >  <dig> alkanes  <cit> . it could be expected that p450bm3j will have a higher priority for ω <dig> hydroxylation when using a longer-chain alcohol substrate. so we generated another engineered e. coli bm3j that overexpressed p450bm3j. the same as bm <dig>  bm3j had no activity on propanol and butanol, and exhibited a low activity on pentanol, with  <dig> -pentanediol as the only product . but when using heptanol and decanol as substrates, bm3j produced more  <dig> -heptanediol and  <dig> -decanediol than bm <dig>  with  <dig> -heptanediol and  <dig> -decanediol accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of total heptanediols and decanediols, respectively .

to examine if the increased ω- <dig> hydroxylation is mainly attributed to a specific amino acid substitution, we made  <dig> single mutants that correspond to the  <dig> amino acid substitutions of p450bm3j, namely, v78a, t175i, a184v, f205c, s226r, h236q, e252g, r255s, a290v and l353v. the ratio of  <dig> -decanediol to total decanediols increased from  <dig>  % in bm <dig> to ~50 % in r255s , suggesting the increased ratio of  <dig> -decanediol to total decanediols in bm3j is mainly attributed to the substitution of arg <dig> to ser <dig>  which allows the ω terminal carbon of the decanol substrate to move a little closer to the ser <dig>  and in the meanwhile to move a little farther away from the heme. this movement makes the ω- <dig> carbon deviate from its best position for hydroxylation, and thus decreases the efficiency of ω- <dig> hydroxylation. the other  <dig> amino acid substitutions may have a combined effect on the constriction of the substrate-binding channel and the change of the substrate orientation .fig.  <dig> three-dimensional structures of p450bm <dig> and its variants. p450bm <dig> heme domain with palmitoleic acid bound was obtained from 1fag . swiss-model derived homology models of p450bm <dig> variant structures, using 1fag as the template . the amino acid residues involved in laboratory evolution are depicted in stick symbols. b, p450bm3j; c, p450j2; d, p450j2-f87a




the effect of heme end residues on the regioselectivity of p450bm3j
to further improve the regioselectivity of p450bm3j, we need to further constrict the substrate-binding channel. the val <dig> in p450bm <dig> is located near the ω terminus of fatty acid substrates, so it may be vital in controlling the substrate orientation. fatty alcohol substrates should have a quite similar substrate orientation in the active site to the fatty acid substrates, which can be reflected by the regioselectivity for heptanol and decanol hydroxylation. the substitution of val <dig> in p450bm <dig> to ala <dig> in p450v78a nearly does not change the regioselectivity for decanol, as alanine has a similar property to valine. but when the ala <dig> in p450bm3j was substituted to phe <dig>  yielding a variant j <dig>  the ratio of  <dig>  7-decanediol  to total decanediols further increased to  <dig>  % from  <dig>  % in bm3j . the phenyl group of phe <dig> creates a narrower space between phe <dig> and the heme. this conformational change forced the carbon chain bend, made the ω, ω- <dig> and ω- <dig> terminal carbons move farther away from the heme, and finally resulted in the decrease of undesired ω- <dig> and ω- <dig> hydroxylation . therefore, the residues located around the heme end of the substrate-binding channel indeed play more important roles in determining the regioselectivity of the alcohol hydroxylases for medium-chain alcohol substrates.fig.  <dig> regioselectivities of native p450bm <dig> and its variants for decanol. decanol was used as substrate, and product decanediols were analyzed by gc-ms.  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -decanediols represent ω- <dig>  ω- <dig> and ω- <dig> hydroxylation, respectively. bm <dig> expresses the native p450bm <dig>  while bm3j, j <dig>  j2-r47l and j2-f87a express different p450bm <dig> variants



to test this hypothesis, two residues, arg <dig> and phe <dig>  were chosen for further modification. arg <dig> is located at the mouth of substrate binding site and its guanidinium group is thought to provide an important ion-pair interaction with the carboxylate group of the fatty acid substrates  <cit> , while phe <dig> is located above the heme and is known to be an important factor in determining the regioselectivity of substrate hydroxylation  <cit> . the substitution of arg <dig> to leu <dig> was found to increase the hydroxylase activity towards pentane and propylbenzene  <cit> . the r47l mutation was then incorporated into the variant j <dig>  generating a new variant j2-r47l. as expected, the regiospecificity profile of j2-r47l was nearly the same as that of j <dig> , demonstrating the substitution of arg <dig> to leu <dig> did not change the substrate orientation and had little connection with the regioselectivity for alcohol substrates. but when the phe <dig> was substituted to ala <dig> , the ratio of  <dig> -decandediol to total decanediols further increased to  <dig>  % . the substitution of phe <dig> to ala <dig> released the space for the α-terminus of decanol to move towards the heme, and in the meanwhile made the benzene ring of phe <dig> rotate away from the ω terminus of decanol . this incident allowed the ω, ω- <dig> and ω- <dig> terminal carbons of decanol to further move away from the heme, leading to the increased distribution of  <dig> -decandediol. the heme end residues are responsible for contraction or expansion of the hydrophobic pocket, so they can affect the alcohol orientation in the substrate-binding channel and finally control the regioselectivity of the alcohol hydroxylation.

CONCLUSIONS
the engineering strategy described above inaugurates a new realm for the high-specificity production of  <dig> -decanediol, which is a promising monomer for the development of advanced materials. the desired  <dig> -decanediol was finally produced, being the first successful report on the biosynthesis of diols with one hydroxyl group at the subterminus. the regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation was greatly improved by laboratory evolution. conservative structural models of the p450bm <dig> variants demonstrate that the heme end residues in the substrate-binding channel play a key role in determining the regioselectivity for medium-chain alcohols. this study not only provides a good strategy for the biosynthesis of  <dig> -decanediol, but also gives a promising approach for the production of other useful diols. more and more advanced materials can be expected once these new diol monomers are available.
