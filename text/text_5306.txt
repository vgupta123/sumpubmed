BACKGROUND
the syt-ssx oncogene is the product of a recurrent t chromosomal translocation that characterizes synovial sarcoma , a high grade, soft tissue cancer that typically arises in adolescents and young adults. because synovial sarcoma tumors are known to develop in multiple sites of the body , it is believed that the disease originates in a primitive stem cell capable of differentiation into multiple lineages  <cit> . recent studies have supported this hypothesis since human synovial sarcoma cells displayed features of multipotent stem cells whose differentiation capacity was deregulated by the oncogene  <cit> , and transgenic mouse modeling revealed that tumors recapitulating ss features developed in precursors of the muscle lineage but not in more differentiated myocytes upon expression of the oncogene  <cit> . syt-ssx formation is the primary event in synovial sarcoma, and its prevalent expression in the ss tumors implicates it in cancer initiation and progression  <cit> . determining the molecular function of syt-ssx is therefore essential for unraveling the mechanism of tumorigenesis in synovial sarcoma.

wild type syt  and ssx  are nuclear proteins believed to function in the regulation of gene expression. syt is required for early embryonic development  <cit>  and is widely expressed in adult tissues. it lacks known dna-binding motifs  <cit>  and forms direct associations with key transcription modulators, including the p <dig> acetyl transferase , the swi/snf chromatin-remodeling complex atpase, brg1/brm  <cit> , and the repressor complex component, sin3a  <cit> . all three syt-binding proteins are known epigenetic controllers, thus these interactions are thought to regulate the coactivating function of syt.

in contrast, the ssx genes encode a nine-member family of transcriptional corepressors located on the x chromosome whose physiological functions remain unclear  <cit> . like syt, ssx proteins lack a dna binding domain; therefore, they may also exert their function via protein-protein interactions. it was revealed that ssx <dig> and ssx <dig> colocalize with polycomb group  complexes through the ssxrd , a highly conserved domain responsible for the bulk of its repressor activity  <cit> . additional studies suggest that ssx proteins may also be targeted through direct interactions with chromatin or by binding to sequence-specific transcription factors  <cit> .

when syt-ssx forms, it retains almost the entire coding sequence of syt, hence binding to the coactivators p <dig> and brg1-swi/snf  <cit> . most often, the fusion occurs with the c-terminal half of either ssx <dig> or ssx <dig>  <cit>  and the association with silencing polycomb components is preserved, creating a transcriptional imbalance: the naturally antagonistic polycomb and swi/snf complexes which function in concert during development to coordinate multipotency and differentiation  <cit>  are brought to the same genomic sites by the mutant protein. the predicted outcome is a global alteration in the nuclear programming of the syt-ssx-expressing cell, leading to tumor initiation. both aberrant silencing and activation of target genes via polycomb activity manipulation occur due to syt-ssx. syt-ssx <dig> associates with the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene, egr <dig>  and recruits polycomb proteins to this locus causing its repression  <cit> . syt-ssx <dig> expression also leads to aberrant transcriptional derepression of several polycomb targets by enhancing degradation of the polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  core component, bmi <dig>  <cit> . the capacity to alter the epigenetic status of target genes also implies the persistence of the altered program in the resulting tumor. the activities of both brg1-swi/snf and polycomb maintain the expression status of genes when the initiating signal, either activation or repression, is gone  <cit> . this suggests that syt-ssx could dominantly reprogram the cell through modulation of epigenetic transcriptional control.

recently, in an effort to elucidate the initial steps of cellular transformation by syt-ssx <dig>  we adopted two differentiation systems, the c2c <dig> myoblasts and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells . this choice was based on the desire to conduct the syt-ssx <dig> studies in undifferentiated systems that were physiologically close to the two cellular backgrounds in which ss tumors developed  <cit> . in a comparative microarray analysis, we were struck by the predominance of upregulated proneural genes in both cell lines expressing syt-ssx <dig>  <cit> . to examine how syt-ssx <dig> dictated the proneural lineage, we set out to identify the specific gene loci to which the oncogene was recruited in the c2c <dig> myoblasts, by chipseq  analysis. correlation of syt-ssx <dig> occupancy with transcription regulation within a 10kb window from gene transcription start sites  revealed that an extensive array of neural genes was directly occupied by the oncogene in their proximal regulatory regions  <cit> . this result strongly suggested that syt-ssx <dig> dictated commitment to the neural lineage through its physical recruitment to genes involved in diverse aspects of neural function and growth. differentiation analysis further supported the dominant reprogramming by syt-ssx <dig>  notably, while syt-ssx <dig> reprogrammed the stem/progenitor cells to the neural lineage, it disrupted their normal differentiation, as the bmmscs and c2c <dig> cells were unable to undergo adipogenesis and myogenesis, respectively  <cit> .

another significant finding was a concomitant activation by syt-ssx <dig> of known controllers of stem cell growth and lineage-specification: the wnt, fibroblast growth factor , sonic hedgehog , notch, and transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein  pathways. notably, direct targeting and activation of the fgf receptor gene, fgfr <dig>  by syt-ssx <dig> were responsible for the induction of the neural phenotype in the stem cells  <cit> .

these studies uncovered a dominant function of the syt-ssx <dig> oncogene in redirecting differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells. they also revealed the activation of an autocrine signaling network that would render the stem cell autonomous and facilitate its transformation. remarkably, the syt-ssx2-driven effects were not only occurring in the c2c <dig> myoblasts and the human bmmscs, but they were also evident in human ss tumor cells, revealing the persistent activation of syt-ssx function throughout the life of the cancer  <cit> .

these findings strongly suggest that aberrant reprogramming forms the basis of syt-ssx transforming activity. to begin to understand its mechanism we decided to closely examine the nature of syt-ssx <dig> recruitment to genomic loci. recent evidence suggests that co-regulated gene subsets are characterized by common histone modification signatures. it has been shown that genes participating in similar functional pathways with identical expression patterns are marked by the same complement of histone modifications in yeast and mouse myoblasts  <cit> , so combinations of markers may serve as a signature for transcriptional regulators denoting the coordinated expression of these genes. since syt-ssx <dig> interacts with epigenetic controllers, we sought to determine if a signature set of epigenetic markers associated with syt-ssx <dig> occupancy exists, and to ascertain whether this specific set of markers could predict transcriptional activation or repression mediated by the oncogene. to answer these questions, we decided to conduct an in-depth analysis of the genome-wide binding of syt-ssx <dig> and define the chromatin state of the genomic loci that attract the translocation.

we observed that syt-ssx <dig> association with the genome is non-random, and it localizes to distinct regions. however, our most significant finding was the discovery that syt-ssx <dig> occupies trimethylated histone h <dig> lysine 27-  labeled regions within or near over 70% of positively regulated and 40% of negatively regulated genes. h3k27me <dig> represents the modification characteristic of polycomb-silenced genes, and its prominent association with syt-ssx <dig> supports a role for the oncogene in the re- activation of polycomb-silenced genes. these data suggest that polycomb complexes serve as a recruitment module for the fusion protein. an additional subset of downregulated syt-ssx <dig> target genes are characterized by association of the protein with histone modifications that correlate with transcriptional activation. taken together, there are at least  <dig> mechanisms of syt-ssx <dig> recruitment to target genes: one dependent on pcg proteins and the other polycomb-independent.

these results provide a fundamental basis for future research that will unravel the effect of syt-ssx <dig> on the silenced differentiation programs stabilized by polycomb and how their disruption leads to cellular transformation.

RESULTS
syt-ssx <dig> binding across the genome is heterogeneous and nonrandom
as an initial step toward elucidating the mechanism of gene expression programming by syt-ssx <dig> in mesenchymal precursor cells, we decided to start by examining its landing pattern in the genome. to generate a global picture of the syt- ssx <dig> binding sites throughout the genome, we relied on the chipseq experiment performed in c2c <dig> myoblasts expressing the oncogene  <cit> . the chipseq analysis led to the identification of nearly  <dig>  genomic regions  bound by the syt- ssx <dig> nuclear complex. the specificity of syt-ssx <dig> peaks was confirmed by a maximum false discovery rate of  <dig> %  <cit> . to derive the distribution pattern of syt- ssx <dig> binding, we performed a sliding window analysis in which each chromosome was subdivided into 500kb bins, and the number of syt-ssx <dig> peaks in each bin was tabulated. syt-ssx <dig> displayed heterogeneous binding among the chromosomes as a whole and along each chromosome individually . nearly 20% of the binding sites  are located on the x chromosome, whereas chromosome  <dig> has  <dig> binding sites . interestingly, areas with high levels of binding are located at chromosome ends, notably on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x . this trend is also seen to a lesser degree on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 16- <dig> . binned binding sites appear to cluster loosely into  <dig> density categories: low, medium, and high. low-density clusters are similar to the cluster centered around 5mb on chromosome  <dig> and contain bins with < <dig> peaks . medium- density clusters contain 1- <dig> bins with 100- <dig> peaks surrounded by other bins with less than  <dig> peaks like the clusters centered at 28mb or 74mb on chromosome  <dig> . the cluster centered at 179mb on chromosome  <dig>  is an example of a high-density cluster which contains bins with > <dig> peaks with nearby bins containing > <dig> peaks. these data indicate that syt-ssx <dig> recruitment to target loci is nonrandom and displays a preference for specific chromosomal regions.

chromosomes were subdivided into 500kb bins, and the number of syt-ssx <dig> chipseq peaks was tabulated for each bin.

syt-ssx <dig> binding strongly correlates with the polycomb marker histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation
after enumerating its genome-wide locations, we asked whether syt-ssx <dig> is recruited to specific loci by distinct epigenetic modules. identifying the determinants of syt-ssx <dig> recruitment would reveal crucial details concerning the mechanism by which it modulates transcription. to determine if syt-ssx <dig> binding might be associated with specific epigenetic markers, previously published genome-wide datasets for histone modifications and rna polymerase ii binding sites   <cit>  in naïve unstimulated c2c <dig> myoblasts were intersected with our syt-ssx <dig> dataset allowing us to determine the nature of the stable epigenetic landscape to which syt-ssx <dig> was recruited. positions of histone modification enrichment and protein binding are reported as chromosomal positions, thus areas where the datasets intersect can be determined computationally. for our study, we looked for regions that overlap ≥  <dig> nucleotide since syt-ssx <dig> interacts with large protein complexes, and a 1-base overlap suggests close proximity to a given modification. by this method, we found quite strikingly that  <dig>  syt-ssx2-occupied regions  overlapped with trimethylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> , the modification associated with polycomb repressive complexes. this represents approximately 13% of the total h3k27me3- enriched regions in the genome of the c2c <dig> myoblasts , indicating that at the global level, syt-ssx <dig> is preferentially targeted to a subset of polycomb-regulated genes. overlap with other histone modifications and polii was not as extensive . the next highest amount of overlap was seen with monomethylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  followed by acetylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> . this accounts for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of regions marked by h3k4me <dig> and h3k18ac, respectively , indicating that syt-ssx <dig> is associated with only a small subset of locations labeled by either of these modifications. it has been suggested that these marks identify enhancer elements  <cit>  highlighting another possible mechanism by which syt-ssx <dig> may affect gene expression.

the number and percent of peaks are relative to the total number of syt-ssx <dig> binding sites .

columns  <dig> and  <dig> show the total number of syt-ssx <dig> peaks overlapping with each modification. numbers in columns  <dig> and  <dig> represent the extent to which the syt-ssx <dig> peaks cover the total genomic area of each modification.

the prominence of syt-ssx <dig> occupying regions enriched in h3k27me <dig> led to the question of their location relative to known genes. it has been shown that polycomb complexes can mediate both short- and long-range control of gene expression  <cit> , thus we determined the location of the overlapping regions between syt-ssx <dig> and h3k27me <dig> relative to known genes.  <dig>  genes could be annotated to syt- ssx2/h3k27me <dig> intersecting areas, and of these,  <dig> % of the peaks were located within the gene itself . nearly  <dig> genes had overlapping sites from 0-5kb upstream of gene transcription start sites , and together with the genes marked by syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> regions within the coding sequence, they account for 50% of the total syt-ssx2-polycomb labeled genes . these data strongly indicate that syt-ssx <dig> interacts with polycomb complexes that function at short-range. altogether, these data illustrate that syt-ssx <dig> may be preferentially targeted to specific genomic locations through interaction with polycomb complexes and/or their associated histone modifications. this is consistent with previous studies in which syt-ssx <dig> was able to associate with polycomb proteins  <cit> . moreover, syt-ssx <dig> may function through the modulation of polycomb activity via short-range interactions.

regions of syt-ssx <dig> binding intersecting with regions of h3k27me <dig>  were annotated to the closest tss. a total of  <dig>  genes were found to be associated with syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> in this manner. percent of genes refers to the number of genes with a syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> overlapping region over  <dig> .

differential patterns of syt-ssx <dig> binding are associated with its transcriptional activity
we next inquired whether the pattern of syt-ssx <dig> occupancy and its global recruitment to distinct epigenetic modifications correlated with its regulatory effects on gene transcription. we addressed this question by intersecting the chipseq-derived syt-ssx <dig> genomic sites with the gene profile microarray of c2c <dig> myoblasts expressing the oncogene  <cit> . by including differentially regulated genes with syt- ssx <dig> binding sites at any distance upstream of the tss or within the gene body, we identified a total of  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes associated with syt-ssx <dig> peaks. these genes were mapped to their relative chromosomal location to determine if there was an association between the number of syt-ssx <dig> peaks and gene activity. as a general trend, negatively regulated genes were associated with low- density clusters  while high-density clusters most often corresponded with positively regulated genes . interestingly, there does not appear to be a correlation between the density of syt- ssx <dig> binding and the number of genes that are either up- or downregulated. on chromosome  <dig>  a high-density cluster is centered at 153mb, however only  <dig> genes  are associated with this area .

conversely, on chromosome  <dig>  a region dense with activated genes centered at 102mb most closely corresponds to a low-medium density cluster . taken together, these data indicate that syt-ssx <dig> binding correlates with alterations in gene activity; however, not all binding sites are associated with changes in gene expression, suggesting that syt-ssx <dig> may have additional functions in the nucleus. these results are in line with a previous observation that the majority of syt-ssx <dig> peaks are located at distances greater than 50kb from gene tss  <cit>  indicating that the oncogene may be involved in chromatin structure regulation, thereby affecting gene expression at long range.

we then narrowed our focus to the study of differentially regulated genes to determine whether syt-ssx <dig> binding patterns could distinguish gene activation from gene repression. interestingly, the distribution of syt-ssx <dig> binding sites upstream of the tss was markedly different depending on whether a gene was positively or negatively regulated by oncogene expression. overall, more than half of the upregulated genes bound by syt-ssx <dig>  have at least  <dig> peak within a window from 0-20kb upstream of the tss. this number decreased with increasing distance . in contrast,  <dig> % of the genes that are downregulated and bound by syt-ssx <dig> have peaks within a 0-20kb window upstream of the tss. this percentage increases with increasing distance, peaks from 50-100kb then decreases at distances between 100-150kb and 150-200kb . these data suggest that syt-ssx2-associated transcriptional activation is correlated with binding at close range whereas transcriptional repression associates with binding at farther distances.

syt-ssx <dig> recruitment to polycomb-modified chromatin and enhancer elements is associated with its transcriptional activity
recently, it has been shown that genes within specific functional groups can be distinguished by the pattern of histone modifications surrounding them. this suggests that genes within a distinct pathway have a specific epigenetic signature that allows them to be recognized by particular activating and/or repressing factors. in this way, the cell can simultaneously regulate a cohort of genes involved in a given process  <cit> . to know whether similar epigenetic markings distinguished the subsets of genes that were differentially regulated by syt-ssx <dig>  overlap of syt-ssx <dig> peaks with histone modifications at the gene loci was determined. seventy-two percent  of the upregulated genes and  <dig> % of the downregulated genes bound by syt-ssx <dig> have associated peaks that overlap with h3k27me <dig>  corroborating previous reports that the fusion protein is targeted to polycomb-regulated genes. surprisingly,  <dig> % of the upregulated genes and  <dig> % of the downregulated genes have syt-ssx <dig> peaks that overlap with h3k4me <dig>  this is significant considering that the overlap with h3k4me <dig> occurs with only  <dig> % of the total syt-ssx <dig> peaks overall. it also means that syt-ssx <dig> binding to enhancer elements may be a specific feature for genes destined for altered expression. since this modification labels enhancer elements  <cit> , the association of syt-ssx <dig> with these sites as well as polycomb target sites suggests that syt-ssx <dig> may effect transcription by modulating both enhancer and polycomb function.

distinct patterns of chromatin marks characterize genes occupied and regulated by syt-ssx2
we next decided to examine more closely the epigenetic landscape around the genes that were differentially regulated by syt-ssx <dig>  our goal was to generate a model for syt-ssx <dig> recruitment that would provide important leads into its mode of gene expression alteration, and determine whether distinct mechanisms are used by the fusion protein to activate or repress genes. as a first step, we tabulated the number of syt-ssx <dig> peaks for each gene within a particular expression category  that overlapped with histone modifications, polii binding, and dna methylation in 5kb windows up to 50kb upstream of tss and within the gene. we limited our analyses to this distance because of the association of syt-ssx <dig> with polycomb-marked regions at close-range relative to gene tss and because of the difficulty in definitively assigning functional significance to binding sites at farther distances. for this analysis we also only characterized genes that had syt-ssx <dig> binding sites that overlapped with at least  <dig> epigenetic marker and identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes by this criterion. of these upregulated genes, 50% had overlapping sites between the fusion protein and h3k27me <dig> . this percentage decreases with increasing distance consistent with the trend described above with respect to all genes with syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> intersecting regions. also consistent with trends described above, the second most abundant overlap occurred between syt-ssx <dig> and h3k4me <dig> within the gene body. association between syt- ssx <dig> and other histone modifications, particularly those related to transcriptional activation  was also seen within gene bodies, although to a much lesser extent than either h3k27me <dig> or h3k4me <dig> . in general, the number of genes in which syt-ssx <dig> associated with these other modifications decreased with increasing distance, although there are a few exceptions. of the negatively regulated genes, the highest levels of overlap were also seen in the gene body and occurred with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> . for h3k4me <dig>  the number of genes with intersection of this mark with syt-ssx <dig> occupancy generally decreases with increasing distance upstream of the tss; however, from 25-30kb and 40-45kb the number of genes with syt-ssx2/h3k4me <dig> regions was increased relative to the surrounding windows . for h3k27me <dig>  a slightly different pattern is seen. the number of genes with syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> sites decreases dramatically from 0- 5kb but increases with increasing distance upstream of the tss . with downregulated genes, syt-ssx <dig> also appears to associate with modifications related to active transcription. regions enriched in h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k18ac, h4k12ac, and polii occupancy overlap with syt-ssx <dig> binding sites in over 10% of the downregulated genes, and markers associated with transcriptional elongation  overlap with syt-ssx <dig> sites in more than 5% of the downregulated genes . in summary, syt-ssx <dig> associates with epigenetic markers, particularly h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  most of the upregulated genes in this analysis are marked by h3k27me <dig>  and syt-ssx <dig> appears to bind close to the tss. in contrast, syt-ssx <dig> occupies h3k4me1- or h3k27me3-enriched regions in a similar percentage of downregulated genes and also associates with more markers of transcriptional activation and elongation.

percentages are relative to the total number of upregulated genes with syt-ssx <dig> peaks that overlap any epigenetic marker from 0-50kb upstream of the tss and including the gene body . numbers in first row represent distances measured in kilobases.

percentages are relative to the total number of downregulated genes with syt-ssx <dig> peaks that overlap any epigenetic marker from 0-50kb upstream of the tss and including the gene body . numbers in first row represent distances measured in kilobases.

hierarchical and functional clustering of differentially regulated genes by syt- ssx2
in order to determine higher order relationships among the histone modifications themselves and gene expression, and using the criterion that genes were included if they contained a binding site for syt-ssx <dig> that overlapped with at least  <dig> epigenetic marker, hierarchical clustering was performed on the differentially regulated genes. to do so, the degree of overlap between syt-ssx <dig> and a given modification was calculated as a ratio of bases covered per 5kb bin upstream of the tss or the ratio of bases covered in the gene body over the total number of bases in the coding sequence. this data generated a signature of modifications by distance for each gene and was used in hierarchical clustering analyses.

analysis of the upregulated genes corroborated earlier results and identified h3k27me <dig> as the predominant modification associated with syt-ssx <dig> binding and gene expression . the location and extent of h3k27me <dig> was variable across all genes, but there were  <dig> sub-clusters in which syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> intersecting sites were located within the entire range of distances that we analyzed. the first of those sub-clusters is highlighted in figure <dig> . it has been reported previously that genes densely covered by h3k27me <dig> were involved in the differentiation and development of alternate lineage pathways, thus we wanted to determine the function of the genes within this sub-cluster. based on our previous analysis  <cit> , we found that 50% of these genes are involved in neural development and function. to summarize, syt-ssx <dig> occupies regions within and upstream of upregulated genes that are enriched in h3k27me <dig>  functionally, these genes can be subdivided based on the extent of syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> intersection and are in line with our previous observation of the increased expression of genes with neural characteristics.

similar hierarchical clustering was performed on the downregulated genes. this analysis led to the identification of  <dig> clusters of genes with differential signatures. the first is characterized by syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> overlap from 0-10kb and 20-50kb upstream of gene tss, whereas the second cluster is marked by the overlap of syt- ssx <dig> with histone modifications related to transcriptional activation at close ranges . interestingly, these two signatures appear to be mutually exclusive. syt-ssx2/h3k27me <dig> overlaps are minimal or absent in the genes marked by close-range syt-ssx <dig> intersection with activating modifications and vice versa . additionally, unlike the upregulated genes, which were functionally related based on their clustering, the genes within these clusters were not clearly associated with a particular pathway or program. together, these data suggest that syt-ssx2-mediated downregulation of gene expression occurs through different mechanisms, one dependent on recruitment by polycomb and the other independent of polycomb.

discussion
in this report we present evidence that the nuclear recruitment of the syt-ssx <dig> oncogene is a non-random event and that it is directed to specific loci across the genome. polycomb-modified regions form the principal targeting module for the syt- ssx <dig> nuclear complex, supporting earlier observations regarding the association of the oncogene with polycomb components  <cit> . in addition, a subset of the genes bound by syt-ssx <dig> displayed alterations in expression. these genes were typified by certain epigenetic attributes: upregulated genes were characterized by the predominant association of syt-ssx <dig> with regions enriched with the polycomb marker h3k27me <dig>  whereas downregulated genes could be subdivided into at least  <dig> categories distinguished by occupation of the fusion protein in regions displaying either h3k27me <dig> enrichment at short- and long-ranges or the presence of modifications associated with transcriptional activation within the gene body or near the tss.

our genome-wide analyses revealed that syt-ssx <dig> is targeted to over  <dig>  genes, yet alterations in expression are noted for, at most,  <dig> of these targets. it is not unprecedented that the number of binding sites for a particular factor is far greater than the number of genes that are differentially expressed when that factor is induced, as was the case with the myogenesis regulator myod  <cit> , or the pax3-fkhr fusion associated with rhabdomyosarcoma  <cit> . these data also suggest that additional signals may be required in order to produce functional outcomes after binding to target loci. in support of this notion, phosphorylation of bound p <dig> upon treatment with etoposide was required to alter gene expression  <cit> . in the same way, alterations in gene expression by syt-ssx <dig> may require additional signaling events that succeed its binding. the h3k27me <dig> modification is catalyzed by prc <dig>  and it is known that prc <dig> and prc <dig> do not occupy completely identical sets of genes within a given cell type  <cit> . as direct interaction of the fusion protein has only been seen with the prc <dig> component ring1b  <cit> , it follows that syt-ssx <dig> will not associate with all h3k27me3-labeled regions. furthermore, prc <dig> may also be recruited to chromatin independently of prc <dig>  <cit> . recruitment of syt-ssx <dig> by prc <dig> could then explain at least some of the other binding sites that are not enriched for h3k27me <dig>  therefore, it would be interesting to determine the degree of overlap between syt-ssx <dig> chipseq and genome-wide binding patterns of prc <dig> in c2c <dig> cells.

additional signatures distinguished upregulated and downregulated genes. most genes with increased expression and marked by h3k27me <dig> had syt-ssx <dig> binding sites within their body or near their tss, while greater numbers of genes with decreased expression marked by h3k27me <dig> are occupied at a distance. this dissimilarity may reflect alternate mechanisms of polycomb-mediated silencing. for example, it has been reported that the structure of prc <dig> may differ when it is proximal to the tss versus when it is bound distally; functionally, this results in opposite consequences on gene expression after depletion of prc <dig> components  <cit> . therefore, prc <dig> dysfunction caused by syt-ssx <dig> could result in opposite effects. another explanation may involve the ability of syt-ssx <dig> to interact with brg <dig>  in embryonic stem  cells, brg <dig> tunes expression of polycomb target genes resulting in either activation or enhanced silencing, and so may augment repression rather than antagonize it  <cit> .

in addition, a second subcluster of downregulated genes was characterized by the presence of histone modifications associated with active transcription within the gene or proximal  to the tss. together with the fact that close-range binding by syt-ssx <dig> at polycomb-regulated genes results in gene activation, these data indicate that proximal binding by the fusion protein functions to antagonize the transcriptional status of target genes. moreover, previous work has indicated that these are both consequences of aberrant polycomb function since syt-ssx <dig> has been shown both to antagonize and to initiate polycomb silencing  <cit> . in this way, syt-ssx <dig> may act as a switch protein that generally opposes the gene expression profile of the cell.

clustering of neuronal genes occupied by syt-ssx <dig> and enriched with h3k27me3-marked chromatin provided a link to the mechanism of proneural lineage activation by the oncogene  <cit> . more specifically, it begins to explain how dictation of the neuronal program at the expense of commitment to the normal mesenchymal lineages might have taken place. in a recent report on the epigenetic landscape during myogenic differentiation of the c2c <dig> myoblasts, gene subsets pertaining to permanently silenced programs including neurogenesis appeared to be held in check by an abundance of modified histone h3k27me <dig>  reflecting stable silencing by polycomb  <cit> . they represent non-mesodermal lineages whose activation during myogenesis would be inappropriate and disruptive to the myoblast. intriguingly, these programs are believed to be distinctly regulated by prc <dig>  and are not influenced by prc <dig>  <cit> . syt-ssx <dig> has so far been shown to specifically deregulate the silencing function of the bmi/ring <dig> e3-ligase of prc <dig>  <cit> . it follows that syt-ssx <dig> may be recruited to h3k27me <dig> sites by prc <dig>  resulting in the untimely activation of prc1-controlled lineages such as neurogenesis. further investigations into the mechanism of prc <dig> antagonism upon recruitment of syt-ssx <dig> and the factors involved are needed to clarify how the neuronal lineage is activated and the extent of its contribution to normal differentiation block and initiation of tumorigenesis.

additional mechanisms can explain the specificity for the upregulation of neural genes. the first involves the endogenous expression of certain factors that makes a particular outcome more likely in one cell versus a different type. it is hypothesized that expression is the result of the balance between polycomb and trithorax activity at a given gene, and some cell types may possess additional regulators that can affect gene expression once that balance has been perturbed  <cit> . c2c <dig> cells may then express certain factors that could guide the expression of neural genes. one potential factor is the rest/nrsf transcriptional repressor that silences neural genes in alternate lineages. inhibition of its activity leads to neurogenesis in c2c <dig> cells so misexpression of its target genes by syt-ssx <dig> may result in the ectopic neural program seen in these cells  <cit> . in a precedent example, syt-ssx was reported to cause aberrant expression of e-cadherin by interacting with either of the tissue-specific transcriptional repressors snail or slug  <cit> . this suggested that interaction with repressor molecules directs gene activation by the fusion.

an alternate mechanism may involve the activation of tissue-specific enhancer elements. in es cells, enhancers that control the expression of inactive genes involved in differentiation of multiple lineages are labeled by h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  when these elements become active k <dig> becomes acetylated, a modification that can be catalyzed by p <dig>  <cit> . recruitment of syt-ssx <dig> to these elements by interactions with polycomb may lead to increased acetylation of k <dig> by p <dig> resulting in their activation and subsequent perturbations in the balance between silencing and expression.

these data allow us to propose a model of recruitment and regulation of target gene expression by syt-ssx <dig>  in the case of upregulated genes, the fusion protein is recruited by interactions with prc <dig>  and gene activation is determined by the presence of lineage-specific transcription factors or the activation of specific enhancer elements . for downregulated genes, syt-ssx <dig> may be recruited by prc <dig> or prc <dig> at a distance from target promoters  or directly targeted to active genes . recruitment may occur through interactions with the modified histones themselves, the complexes that catalyze those modifications, or additional proteins like sequence-specific transcription factors. the presence of other factors is likely to be important in specifying target genes for repression.

CONCLUSIONS
the data described here provide a foundation for uncovering the mechanism of syt-ssx <dig> recruitment. the preeminent association of syt-ssx <dig> with h3k27me <dig> indicates that the fusion protein does not simply target to regions of open chromatin by default, but it occupies a subset of polycomb loci. most importantly, this analysis has revealed that nuclear programs stably silenced by polycomb complexes in any mesenchymal precursor cell could potentially constitute the primary target for deregulation by syt-ssx <dig>  it provides a justification for the apparent dominant effect of the oncogene in its target cells and the ability of synovial sarcoma to arise in multiple sites of the body.

as binding of syt-ssx <dig> does not completely correlate with changes in gene expression, additional targeting factors, genetic or epigenetic, as well as specific extracellular signals are most likely necessary to provide the proper stimulus for activation of distinct gene subsets and the generation of distinct cell fates. thus, genes that are bound by syt-ssx <dig> but whose expression is unaltered may be poised for activation in response to certain signaling events. indeed, the dependence of the neural phenotype on fgf signaling supports such a scenario  <cit> .

this analysis sets the stage for key developments toward the full understanding of how syt-ssx <dig> redirects a heritable fate in the undifferentiated stem cell and identifying the factors and the extrinsic and intrinsic signals involved in this process. the polycomb proteins are important regulators of gene expression in development as well as cancer, and much attention has focused on the mechanism through which these proteins regulate differentiation and contribute to tumorigenesis. one aspect of polycomb function that has not been addressed extensively is how the activity of these proteins is regulated. as deregulation of polycomb activity seems to be at the heart of syt-ssx <dig> function, the differential binding patterns and their correlation with gene expression described in this report provide a unique opportunity to examine this process in detail.

moreover, as the fusion protein demonstrated a propensity to target the stem cell signaling network  <cit> , the manner in which these pathways regulate polycomb function can also be explored. elaborating how syt-ssx <dig> targets and controls a specific program will clarify how to change the epigenetic structure of one cell to that of an alternate lineage. ultimately, this will improve the efficiency of cellular reprogramming, and more importantly, is essential to understanding the biology of synovial sarcoma.
