BACKGROUND
there has been considerable research carried out in a variety of settings examining pet demography and the roles pets play in human life  <cit> . pet ownership has been associated with various advantages for humans, such as decreased risk of cardiovascular disease  <cit> , reduced doctor visits  <cit> , reduced loneliness  <cit>  and provision of emotional support  <cit> . disadvantages such as trauma from accidents  <cit>  or bites/attacks  <cit> , allergies  <cit>  and zoonotic disease  <cit>  have also been associated with pet ownership. numerous studies have been published in an effort to understand pet demographics and how to address the above issues relating to owned dogs and cats  <cit> . corresponding government legislation has been created in many countries to help control owned dogs and provide adequate welfare for owned pets. examples of this type of legislation can be seen in the uk  <cit> , ireland  <cit>  and the usa  <cit> .

in order to help understand the magnitude of these issues, a baseline animal population estimate is necessary. this baseline is especially needed when seeking to ascertain and interpret prevalence data for dog and cat diseases, to determine where animals are situated geographically and to identify the numbers of animals at risk for exotic disease outbreaks such as rabies  <cit> . these population data are also useful for the veterinary industry, as they enable more focused strategies for providing veterinary care  <cit> . the pet food, pharmaceutical and pet accessories industries are also interested in knowing where to focus their marketing strategies, and demographic information can aid this  <cit> .

many studies collecting pet population data use cross sectional study designs and administer questionnaires to a sample from a given population within the specified study regions by telephone  <cit> , postal addresses  <cit> , door-to-door sampling  <cit>  or census-type selection methods  <cit> . when calculating the estimated population size of dogs and cats, studies have used methods ranging from relatively simple calculations, multiplying human numbers by dog ownership  <cit> , to more complex probability estimates  <cit>  or statistical models  <cit> .

there have been discrepancies in the estimated number of dogs and cats found in the same geographical area at the same period of time, depending on the sampling and the calculation methods used. in a uk study  <cit> , the estimated sizes of the owned cat and dog populations in  <dig> were  <dig> , <dig> cats  and  <dig> , <dig> dogs , whereas a survey carried out by the pet food manufacturers association  estimated the cat and dog population at just over  <dig> million each for the same year  <cit> . given that there are a number of different methods that can be used leading to varying population estimates, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the methods that have been used for estimating the size of owned cat and dog populations and to assess the biases associated with these methods.

RESULTS
bibliographic databases
when the searches from all the bibliographic databases were combined,  <dig> records were obtained. a total of  <dig> duplicate records were found in the combined dataset, leaving  <dig> papers to be considered for inclusion in the analysis. after title and abstract screening,  <dig> relevant papers were obtained for full paper screening. there were  <dig> non-english language papers that needed to be translated. of the  <dig> papers requested through british library document supply centre,  <dig> papers could not be obtained. five papers were found to be based on the data from previously published studies, and were removed.

during full text screening, two papers required assessment from the third reviewer and a total of  <dig> studies met all the initial inclusion criteria and didn’t meet the exclusion criteria as shown in the flow chart in figure  <dig>  of these  <dig> studies,  <dig> papers had insufficient details about the methods of pet number estimation to enable them to be repeated and required additional information from the authors. only two authors responded with sufficient methodological information to enable the studies concerned to go forward for critical appraisal and only six studies remained in the final analysis after critical appraisal .

 <dig>  studies in bold were included in the final review.

 <dig>  methods were judged to be clear  when the methods for calculating the population size estimate reported in the study were transparent and repeatable.

 <dig>  where the methods were clear enough, no attempt was made to contact the author.

during the critical appraisal process one study required assessment from the third reviewer . in the eight studies that were excluded during the critical appraisal process there were particular problems common to most of them: all studies had insufficient description of their methods for them to be repeated, and for five of the studies it was difficult to ascertain if the selection process would lead to a sample of participants that was representative of the target population. only one study used sample size justification in the development of the study. none of the eight excluded studies supplied information about non-responders and only two studies had undertaken measures to address non-responders in the methods. none of the studies discussed selection biases or any limitations of the study.

issues relating to the studies that were included in the review after critical appraisal were: five studies had insufficient description of their methods for them to be fully repeated and for four of the studies it was difficult to ascertain if the selection process would lead to a representative sample of the target population. only three studies used sample size estimations in the development of the study. three of the studies supplied information about non-responders and only one study had undertaken measures to address non-responders in the methods. five of the studies discussed selection bias in their study.

google
when the search from google was completed  <dig> records were extracted from the search engine. a total of  <dig> duplicate records were found leaving a total of  <dig> records to be examined . of these  <dig>  only  <dig> remained for full analysis after title screening for relevance. after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria , only ten web pages remained. an attempt was made to contact the website authors in seven cases where it was difficult to identify if the content of the web page met the inclusion criteria and in two others where the methods were not clear enough to repeat the estimation of the population. none of the website authors responded sufficiently for them to be included in further analyses . only one web page remained after the critical appraisal stage, and was included in the final analysis after appraisal .

two of the included studies were carried out by the same association ten years apart and the second study was modified based on previous studies  <cit> . one of these studies was identified in the bibliographic databases  <cit>  while the other was identified through the google search  <cit> .

sampling/selection methods
two tables summarising the findings relating to the collection and analytical/statistical methods were created for each included study . the methods used for collecting data were mail-out surveys using a commercial list of contacts  <cit> , door-to-door surveys  <cit> , random digit dial telephone surveys  <cit>  and randomised telephone surveys using a commercial list of numbers  <cit> . none of the included studies used specific definitions for pet/owned cat or dog, but asked the respondent if they owned a dog or cat.

risk of bias
the entire set of cross sectional studies examined in the review possessed some risk of selection bias. measurement biases may have been introduced in all the studies resulting from misclassification of pet owners, i.e. being classed as non-owners when they were pet owners due to answering the questionnaire incorrectly  <cit> . some studies were prone to non-response bias where an over-estimation of the pet population could have been introduced  <cit> . bias may be present due to the length of time it took to collect the data as some studies took up to six months to collect data  <cit>  and others collected data from a previous year  <cit>  giving a period prevalence of ownership rather than a point in time estimation. other studies failed to mention a time-frame for data collection  <cit> . the different collection/selection methods had different advantages over each other. for example, mail-out surveys  <cit>  had the potential to include all households, whereas the telephone surveys  <cit>  only included households with telephones. the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods, including biases, are presented in table  <dig> 

methods used to estimate pet population
the statistical/mathematical methods used to determine pet populations in the included studies were mean number of dogs/cats per household multiplied by the number of households in the area  <cit> , human density in the area multiplied by number of dogs per human  <cit>  and calculations using regression coefficients for predictors of ownership to calculate mean pet per person figures  <cit> . only murray et al.  <cit>  used precision measures, providing 95% confidence intervals for their estimates. the advantages and disadvantages of the statistical/mathematical methods in the included studies are presented in table  <dig> 

discussion
only seven studies involving five countries were included in this review, each conducted using different methodologies with a certain level of bias. it is difficult to select an ideal method for estimating pet populations given the differences and risk bias for each method. when interpreting results of population estimates, it is important to take into account the biases and limitation of the studies and to adjust decisions based on those results.

biases in studies
selection bias
as the cross sectional studies were subject to selection bias, it is difficult to determine if the estimates are generalisable to the population being studied  <cit> . as the different studies in this review used different methods, different levels and types of biases could be introduced in each study.

the use of telephone surveys can result in a bias towards households of higher socio-economic standing  <cit> . there have also been issues with declining response rates in the past, and an increase in refusals once contacted  <cit> . these issues may be due to a number of factors, such as increased contact via telephone for sales and marketing, and households having access to call screening/caller identification  <cit> . the majority of the studies based on telephone surveys included in this review did little to manage the potential biases  <cit> . however, one study tried to address this issue by using probability measures of a variable statistically associated with the number of pets in a household  <cit> . this can be difficult to accomplish, as finding a variable that is associated with the number of pets owned by a household/person that can be matched to human population studies can be problematic and may require a large number of participants. also of note is a decreasing number of households using landline numbers due to the use of mobile phones as their sole telephone contact that may increase the biases associated with telephone surveys. in the usa the percentage of adults with a landline telephone had declined to  <dig> %, in  <dig> and  <dig> % of adults without a landline had mobile phone service in the household  <cit> .

selection bias can be introduced in postal studies, especially where a commercial list is used for the sampling frame. often it is difficult to be certain how the list has been compiled, and how the people on these lists compare to the target population. the studies that used mail out surveys in this review  <cit>  did try to address this problem by using quota control cut-offs in order to select an overall representative population for analyses which could help to remove selection bias. however, this method makes it difficult to measure confidence intervals accurately and make inferences  <cit> .

selection bias can be introduced in door-to-door surveys as logistical problems can make it difficult to access participants. butler and bingham  <cit>  were unable to physically access households in their study area as roads to these households were impassable or did not exist. households away from passable roads may be more likely to own a dog for protection, or may be less likely to own a dog because they are less well-off and have less disposable income; there is no way of knowing without sampling these households. if there is little known about this un-sampled population it is difficult to adjust the analysis to take these biases into account.

when random selection is not used or the selection process is not truly random, a non-representative sample may be selected from the sample frame, as not every household has an equal chance of being selected into the study. the use of proper random selection seemed to be a particular problem in the door-to-door sampling studies, and rather than using geographical random selection or a systematic random sampling approach  they selected every second household for sampling  <cit>  or a specific number from each street  <cit>  giving no indication as to how the first household was selected.

non-response bias
non-response bias may occur for a number of reasons, including failure to locate or contact a household, refusal to participate/complete a questionnaire, refusal to answer specific questions or inability to communicate  <cit> .

mail-out surveys by their nature give the participant the time to scan through the questionnaire. a potential participant can therefore be aware that the survey is about pet ownership, and if they do not have a pet, they may be inclined not to complete the survey, thinking the survey does not apply to them. the non-responding, non-owner would not be represented in the sample, leading to over-estimation of the pet population and this may have occured in surveys of the american veterinary medical association  <cit> . non-response in mail-out surveys can be reduced using numerous methods including monetary incentives, short questionnaires, sending personalised questionnaires and letters, recorded/first class delivery, stamped return envelopes, contacting participants before sending the questionnaire, follow up contact once a questionnaire is sent, and providing non-respondents with a second questionnaire  <cit> . none of these methods were stated as being used by the two postal surveys in this review  <cit> .

at the start of the telephone conversation, slater et al.  <cit>  informed the participants about the topic before the questionnaire was administered, and it is possible that participants might have been inclined to hang up if they did not have pets, thinking the survey did not apply to them. non-response in telephone surveys can be minimized by dispatching personally addressed introductory letters in advance, increasing the number of call attempts, targeting call times and declaring credentials of the institute at the beginning of the telephone call  <cit> . using introductory letters in advance should be used with care as while this approach may increase response rates it may also increase non-response bias as explained previously. some telephone studies  <cit>  used repeated call attempts to decrease non-response and murray et al.  <cit>  introduced their study stating that they were interested in those that did not own a pet as well as those who did. however other studies did not state any methods to reduce non-response bias  <cit> .

measurement biases
some of the reviewed studies may have ended up with an underestimation of the population size. pet owners may be inclined to say they did not have a pet for fear of retribution where households are not permitted to own a pet by a landlord  <cit> , or a household may have a breed that is banned  <cit> . methods of preventing measurement bias would be to adequately trial the questionnaire; this ensures that it is accurately measuring the outcomes of interest  <cit> . it is difficult to ascertain if any of the reviewed studies addressed measurement bias, as while some stated they used introductions  <cit> , none stated whether anonymity was guaranteed.

biases introduced by length of sampling time
in owned dog and cat population estimation, if a study takes a significant period of time to collect data it can interfere with the accuracy of the results of the estimate. this is highly dependent on the stability and growth rate of the population under investigation. for example if the birth rate is much higher than the death rate in a population, it could lead to an overestimation of the population. it is also important to note that some studies used a period prevalence of one year  <cit> , rather than point estimation. a study using a period prevalence could lead to a higher population estimate than those estimating point prevalence, making it difficult to compare results.

quality of the studies
overall the quality of the studies was deemed questionable, as only seven studies out of  <dig> were of the desired level for inclusion during the critical appraisal stage. this shows the importance of using critical appraisal tools in evidence-based veterinary medicine as a means of assessing quality both for inclusion in a review and for use in practice. it is important to note that the studies generally failed in areas that are critical for cross sectional studies such as; having a clear research aim, complete transparent description of the methods used, sample size justification/power analysis  <cit> , and collecting and addressing information about non-responders and selection bias  <cit>  this also highlights the importance of reporting guidelines in increasing the transparency of research and these should be used in the development and reporting of scientific papers  <cit> . this study demonstrates that while there is a reporting guideline for observational studies , authors and reviewers of published studies seem either unaware of them or are unwilling to use them, as has also been demonstrated by cobo et al. for a range of study types  <cit> .

the ideal method for determining the pet population of an area would be to do a complete census of the area, including all households and pets. if this is not feasible, the households should be selected at random from a sample frame that includes all households in the given area. if the sample frame cannot be taken from a suitable population, or selection is likely to lead to biases, then appropriate statistical methods should be used to help deliver a more precise estimate of the population. if there is a linear association between the number of owned cats or dogs and the independent variable, then regression coefficients  <cit>  can be used. however, if the outcome is categorical a more complex multivariate model with predictive probabilities should be used  <cit> .

difficulties and limitations in the study
as this systematic review was not a review of interventions but of observational techniques, it posed some difficulties and limitations. every effort was made to conduct this review to the highest standards as recommended in the cochrane handbook  <cit>  and to report it using the moose guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies  <cit> . these guidelines were used as there were no reporting guidelines for systematic reviews of cross sectional studies or of methodologies. there were several grey areas or areas not covered in these guidelines that were particularly difficult to overcome in this type of review, including;

• what databases and grey literature sources should be used in a review? grey literature refers to literature that is not published in peer reviewed journals or books  <cit> 

• how many reviewers are required at each of the searching, screening and appraisal stages?

• what critical appraisal tools should be used?

• should the initial screening processes be carried out blind?

• how should grey literature sources be searched?

to overcome some of these problems we extensively searched numerous databases, including cab abstracts, to ensure maximum coverage of the veterinary literature as outlined by grindlay et al.  <cit> . the lead author was familiar with pet population research therefore it was not possible to blind the screening process.

there are numerous critical appraisal tools that have been created to examine observational studies but they are focused mainly on case–control and cohort studies. there is a lack of critical appraisal tools available specifically aimed at cross sectional studies  <cit> . the authors designed their own critical appraisal tool specifically to appraise cross sectional studies as it was deemed necessary to overcome the limitations of other appraisal tools.

google was used for grey literature searches as it is the most common method for searching the internet  <cit> . it is important to note that although google advised that it had  <dig> , <dig> hits available at the time of the study, it only allowed a maximum of  <dig>  hits to be viewed. as a comparison, at the time of the study yahoo only allowed  <dig>  hits to be viewed, hence google was chosen. google also tailors its results to the location and preferences of the searcher  <cit> , which results in bias as the grey literature searches on one computer in the uk will not necessarily result in the same hits as on another computer, or in another country. the google search did lead to one further study being included in the review; for other reviews the value of searching the grey literature in this way should be assessed. ideally an all-inclusive grey literature resource for veterinary information should be created, allowing more targeted investigation of non-journal material.

CONCLUSIONS
implications for practice
pet population estimates are still helpful in focusing strategies for providing veterinary care; however it is important to take into account the biases of the study and to adjust decisions appropriately. the results from the studies found in this review are not directly comparable due to the differences in methods. industry decision makers should examine the differences between studies before adjusting their marketing strategies.

implications for research
it can be taken from the results of the critical appraisal in this review that careful study design to minimise bias is a necessity before executing a study to estimate pet populations. there is also a need for researchers to become familiar with reporting guidelines such as strobe.
