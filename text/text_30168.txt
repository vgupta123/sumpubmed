BACKGROUND
the thoroughbred racehorse is an elite athlete, that for four hundred years has been selected for physiological traits enabling exceptional speed and stamina. as a highly adapted athlete the thoroughbred is a suitable model for understanding the physiology of exercise  <cit> . thoroughbreds have a very high aerobic capacity or maximal oxygen uptake   <cit>  relative to their body mass. a bout of intense exercise requires both aerobic and anaerobic energy production and a thoroughbred may increase its metabolic rate from basal levels by up to 60-fold under racing conditions  <cit> . a critical component for athletic performance is muscle and it is notable that the thoroughbred has a high skeletal muscle mass comprising over 55% of total body mass  <cit> .

the biological importance of skeletal muscle is reflected in its remarkable structural and functional plasticity that enables rapid alterations to phenotype following repeated bouts of exercise  <cit> . a single bout of acute exercise induces multiple stresses in skeletal muscle, including increased demand for atp and mechanical stress  <cit> . the responses to these stressors can be divided into two broad categories: the return to homeostasis, and the adaptive response. the principle processes associated with homeostatic recovery are glucose sparing, elevated fat oxidation, glycogen resynthesis and free radical quenching, as well as the repairing of free radical-mediated damage and restoration of intracellular electrolyte concentrations and ph  <cit> . the adaptive response is the process whereby skeletal muscle responds to repeated exercise bouts  in ways that cumulatively lead to an enhanced ability to maintain muscle homeostasis during exercise. this conditioning response involves both morphological changes, such as hypertrophy, and metabolic responses such as an increased capacity for oxidative substrate metabolism in mitochondria and a shift toward oxidizing proportionately more fats and less glucose during exercise  <cit> .

exercise studies using human subjects have demonstrated that changes in the expression of a wide range of mrna transcripts play a major role in the adaptive response of muscle to exercise  <cit> . furthermore, microarray studies have shown that a large number of genes are differentially expressed in skeletal muscle following exercise  <cit> . a single bout of exercise has been shown to increase mrna expression particularly in genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism  <cit> .

while protein changes and mrna quantified in small panels of genes by western blotting and real time qrt-pcr  <cit>  have been investigated, global mrna expression during the immediate-response period  has not, to our knowledge, previously been reported in skeletal muscle following exercise in any species. also, global gene expression changes in equine skeletal muscle following exercise have not been reported. therefore to identify novel genes and key regulatory pathways responsible for exercise adaptation we have used equine-specific cdna microarrays to examine global mrna expression in skeletal muscle from a cohort of thoroughbred horses  at two time points  following a standardised incremental-step exercise test on a high-speed equine treadmill.

RESULTS
experiment overview
eight four-year old unconditioned thoroughbred horses  were exercised to maximum heart-rate or fatigue in a standardized incremental-step exercise test  <cit>  on a high-speed equine treadmill. skeletal muscle biopsy samples were collected at three time points: at rest pre-exercise , immediately post-exercise  and four hours post-exercise . in a direct comparison microarray experiment, equine cdna microarrays were hybridised with samples from t <dig> vs t <dig> and from t <dig> vs t <dig> for each animal.

exercise parameters
following warm-up, the exercise test comprised an average of six  incremental steps achieving a mean maximum velocity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s and a mean distance of  <dig> . <dig> ±  <dig>  m for an average duration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min. mean maximal heart rate was  <dig> ±  <dig> beats per minute. mean peak post-exercise  lactate concentrations were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l and were significantly increased compared to pre-exercise values .

microarray annotation and gene ontology
of the  <dig>  ests on the microarray  <dig>  aligned to a single location on the equine genome ,  <dig> aligned to more than one location and the remaining  <dig> failed to align to any location with high confidence. fewer than 50%  of the ests matched an ensembl gene, the majority  of which had human orthologs. the human orthologs were used to create input files for gene ontology functional analyses using the david software package  <cit> .

the functional representation of ests on the microarray relative to all genes in the equus caballus ensembl database that had human orthologs  was assessed using  <dig> broad go categories . a similar distribution pattern among go categories was observed for ests on the microarray when compared to all ensembl genes .

immediate response to exercise
differential expression of genes
immediately following exercise  two probes were significantly  differentially regulated. four hours  after exercise  <dig>  probes were differentially expressed with fold changes ranging from + <dig> -fold to - <dig> -fold. at t <dig>   <dig> probes were up-regulated and  <dig> probes were down-regulated. at the chosen significance threshold   <dig> of these probes are likely to be false positives. the probes with the greatest changes in expression  immediately post-exercise are shown in table  <dig>  the probes with the greatest changes in expression  four hours post exercise are shown in table  <dig>  and table  <dig> . a full list of gene expression changes at t <dig> and t <dig> are available in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the equine cdna microarray expression data generated was deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus  repository with experiment series accession .

among the probes with the greatest expression changes  at t1were seven probes representing four genes: three probes representing fos ; two probes representing hspa1a ; one probe located ~ 2kb upstream of pfkfb <dig>  and one probe representing egr <dig> .

the gene expression changes observed for the fos and hspa1a genes are consistent with previous mammalian studies that have shown increased expression of these genes in response to exercise  <cit> . hspa1a, fos and egr <dig> are members of the immediate-early response  gene family. these genes are early regulators of cell growth and differentiation signals, and are induced in response to a wide variety of stress stimuli  <cit> . the heat shock protein hsp <dig>  encoded by the hspa1a gene, is known to protect skeletal muscle cells against the path physiological effects of oxidative stress. in transgenic mouse models this cytoprotection is brought about both through improvement in muscle function and decreased apoptosis  <cit> . it has been suggested that the cytoprotective effects of the hsp <dig> protein are related to an ability to assist with the refolding of denatured or partially degraded proteins  <cit> . hsp <dig> can also interact with proteins involved in the regulation of cellular redox balance and ca2+ homeostasis, and thus reduce oxidative stress and ca2+ overload in response to physiological stress  <cit> . in addition hsp <dig> protects against muscular degeneration and atrophy  <cit>  through inhibition of caspase activation  <cit>  and protein catabolism  <cit>  and hsp <dig> protein levels have been shown to correlate with muscular regeneration following injury  <cit> . together these facts highlight the key role of hsp <dig> in muscle protection following stress and as a modulator of muscular regeneration. the hspa1a gene displayed a further increase in transcript expression at t <dig> , whereas the expression of fos, egr <dig> and pfkfb <dig> had returned to resting levels. this suggests that while fos, egr <dig> and pfkfb <dig> responses may be immediate and transient, the hspa1a response likely contributes to long term adaptation.

the probe upstream of the pfkfb <dig> gene shares strong homology to mammalian homologues of the gene thus it is likely that it represents expression of this gene product. the product of the pfkfb <dig> gene is involved in various aspects of energy sensing and metabolism, but has not previously been shown to be increased due to exercise. however, studies have shown increased expression of pfkfb <dig> in response to glucose deprivation  <cit>  and hypoxia  <cit> , both stimuli associated with exercise. the pfkfb <dig> protein is a powerful activator of glycolysis  <cit> . surprisingly, in a panel of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and other anaerobic metabolites, differential mrna expression was not observed in this experimental cohort despite significant increases in plasma lactate concentrations  <cit> . similar observations of a lack of transcriptional activation of glycolytic genes have been made in human exercise studies  <cit> . pfkfb <dig> is also involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells  <cit>  and a snp in the 3' untranslated region of the pfkfb <dig> gene is associated with obesity in humans  <cit> . the pfkfb <dig> gene promoter contains hypoxic response elements necessary for transactivation by hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig> alpha  in response to hypoxia  <cit> . this is relevant considering the observed increase in hif-1α protein in this cohort of horses immediately after exercise  <cit> .

there was some overlap among probes differentially expressed at t <dig> and those tending towards differential expression at t <dig>  among the  <dig> probes tending towards differential expression  at t <dig>  <dig> were also among those at t <dig>  which is more than twice as many expected by chance. over 96% of the genes had both the same direction of regulation at both time-points and a greater magnitude of change at t <dig>  two genes had a greater magnitude of change at t <dig> and a different directionality was observed for four genes. the genes with the highest observed fold changes at both t <dig> and t <dig> included hspa1a , unadjusted p =  <dig> e-05; t2: + <dig> -fold, p =  <dig> e-05); crtc <dig> ; and slc16a <dig> .

the crtc <dig> protein is a potent activator of pgc-1α , the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit>  and is also involved in the modulation of gluconeogenesis  <cit> . the slc16a <dig> protein is found in greater abundance in fast twitch rather than slow twitch muscle  <cit>  and plays a direct role in lactate efflux out of skeletal muscle. thoroughbred horses have a strikingly high proportion of fast to slow twitch muscle fibres  <cit> , which was also observed in this cohort of horses  <cit> . increased mrna levels of slc16a <dig> were observed in "race fit" compared to moderately conditioned standardbred horses  <cit> . slc16a <dig> also plays a role in the transport of the performance enhancing drug gamma-hydroxybutyric acid   <cit> . ghb is an endogenous metabolite but can also be administered orally as a performance-enhancing drug; therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that endogenous ghb metabolism is associated with natural athletic ability. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing protein  <dig> gene , which is involved in ghb catabolism  <cit>  is located in a genomic region that has been a target for positive selection during four hundred years of thoroughbred evolution  <cit> .

overall, these data suggest that, in addition to a rapid and dramatic induction of a small number of stress response genes immediately after exercise, there are also more subtle early changes in gene expression that are difficult to detect but are functionally relevant. it is possible that many of the genes differentially expressed at t <dig> were also differentially expressed at t <dig>  but show more gradual changes in gene expression and were not detectable at that time point.

overrepresentation of functional ontologies among differentially expressed genes
the relatively small number of probes  tending towards significant differential expression immediately after exercise suggested that deriving meaningful functional information may be problematic given an expected false discovery rate of approximately  <dig> probes in this experiment. therefore the fatiscan gene enrichment test, which incorporates all transcriptional data rather than limiting to only significantly differentially expressed probes was used to analyse the transcriptional profile immediately after exercise  <cit> . genes were ranked by differential expression and functional blocks that were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated immediately after exercise were identified . overrepresented go functional groups associated with up-regulated genes included response to stress, rna metabolism and developmental processes. the overrepresentation of genes involved in the stress response suggests that exercise-induced muscle repair may be a particular requirement for the maintenance of structural integrity in thoroughbred skeletal muscle following disruption of muscle fibres. this may be understood in the light of very high aerobic and anaerobic capacities in thoroughbreds, which enable high intensity exercise even in the unconditioned state. the principal go functional groups associated with down-regulated genes were those involving the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and proton-transporting atp synthase complex. the strong overrepresentation of down-regulated ribosomal genes suggests an inhibition of protein synthesis. previous studies have reported a reduced rate of protein synthesis  <cit>  and observed the disaggregation of polysomes to ribosomes immediately post exercise  <cit> . the down-regulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation may represent a shift form aerobic towards anaerobic respiration.

the majority of exercise studies investigating the immediate response to exercise have focussed on post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications or have used real time qrt-pcr to investigate a limited number of genes  <cit> . because of the lack of literature documenting the immediate transcriptional response to exercise in skeletal muscle it is not clear whether the responses detected in this study are specific to horses, or indeed thoroughbred horses.

delayed response to exercise
differentially expressed genes
a significantly larger number of genes were differentially expressed four hours following exercise. sixteen genes had very significant  increases in expression with magnitudes > + <dig> -fold and  <dig> had had significant  expression differences > + <dig> -fold. among the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes at t <dig> were hspa1a ; tpm <dig> , hsp90aa <dig> , class a member  <dig> gene; + <dig> -fold, p =  <dig> ) and usp <dig> . other notable genes present among those differentially upregulated  were hspa <dig> ; crtc <dig>  and lamp <dig>  were among the most highly differentially regulated transcripts. the hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  proteins have been shown to be associated with the transport of tom  complex proteins to the mitochondrial surface  <cit>  in response to contractile activity. these proteins in turn are responsible for the import of the hundreds of nuclear encoded proteins that function in the mitochondria  <cit> . it clearly follows that the reliance on nuclear encoded proteins for mitochondrial function is subject to the efficiency of protein translocation to the mitochondria while numerous studies have reported hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> induction in skeletal muscle in response to exercise  <cit> , to our knowledge, no study has reported an induction of constitutively expressed hspa <dig> protein. on the other hand, hspa <dig> has been reported to be induced in rat cardiac muscle following hypoxic exposure  <cit>  and may provide a protective effect following oxidative stress  <cit> . lamp- <dig> is a lysosomal receptor involved in the elimination of misfolded proteins. it has been demonstrated that protesomal inhibition results in an accumulation of hsp <dig>  lamp- <dig> and ubiquitin aggregates  <cit> . similarly, the tpm <dig> protein plays a major role in ca2+-regulated skeletal muscle contraction and is upregulated in muscle undergoing regeneration and focal repair  <cit> . presumably the up-regulation of the heat shock genes, tpm <dig>  lamp <dig> and usp <dig> reflects activity in the reparation or degradation of damaged and misfolded proteins  <cit> .

fourteen probes representing  <dig> genes had very significant  decreases in expression at t <dig> with magnitudes greater than - <dig> -fold. one hundred and twenty-six genes had significant  expression differences greater than - <dig> -fold. the most differentially expressed genes were cwf19l <dig> ; uxs <dig> ; txnl <dig> ; pcolce <dig>  ; ndn ; tram <dig> ; and robo <dig> . six probes also had decreased expression at t <dig>  representing glb <dig> , setd <dig>  and four unannotated probes.

overrepresentation of functional ontologies among differentially expressed genes
at t <dig> there was an observed overrepresentation of genes that localised to the actin cytoskeleton, actin filament bundle and cortical actin cytoskeleton . the overrepresentation of genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton may be indicative of responses to contraction and mechanical stimuli and may be associated with muscle remodelling via sarcomerogenesis. this is consistent with an observed overrepresentation of genes in the focal adhesion pathway. actin remodelling has also been shown to be responsible for an increase in glut <dig> translocation in skeletal muscle  <cit> . an overrepresentation of actin-related gene ontologies following exhaustive exercise has not previously been reported. on the other hand, the observed overrepresentations of genes with intramolecular oxidoreductase activity, unfolded protein binding and heat shock protein binding molecular functions are consistent with human exercise studies that predict replenishment of intramuscular energy stores and a stress response during recovery from intense exercise because of ros production, inflammation and intramuscular microtears  <cit> .

because of the larger number of genes with assigned biological processes  the returned go classes had more general higher level functions  providing little insight into the underlying adaptive mechanisms. therefore, we searched for overrepresented kegg pathways among the significantly differentially regulated genes at t <dig>  these included the well established exercise response pathways, insulin signalling  <cit> , type ii diabetes mellitus  <cit> , mtor signalling  <cit>  and mapk signaling  <cit>  as well as focal adhesion and p <dig> signaling pathway. a list of genes differentially expressed in these pathways is provided in additional file  <dig>  the overrepresented kegg pathways are associated with different but overlapping aspects of exercise stimuli and support the hypothesis that the genes governing these cellular pathways have been targets for selection for exercise adaptation in thoroughbreds  <cit> .

the less well described focal adhesion and p <dig> signaling pathways are of particular note for their roles in muscle hypertrophy and metabolic improvements. muscle stretch gives rise to the generation of focal adhesion complexes through the induction of actin polymerisation at focal adhesions and an increase in focal adhesion complex associated proteins has been found in hypertrophic muscle  <cit> . for instance, the mechanosensitive extra cellular matrix protein tenascin-c has been identified as a critical regulator of gene expression relating to repair and growth in muscle following damaging exercise  <cit> . furthermore, focal adhesion kinase  has been shown to be an upstream regulator of the control of muscle mass via p70s6k  <cit>  which may signal mtor  <cit>  independent of akt. the central role of fak in muscle growth and differentiation has been recently been demonstrated. over-expression of fak led to a shift towards slow twitch muscle generation and an up-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism and contraction  <cit> . therefore, an overrepresentation of focal adhesion molecules indicates the importance of mechanical force altering skeletal muscle gene regulation towards muscle growth and remodelling  <cit> . moreover, we have previously determined that focal adhesion molecules may represent targets for recent artificial selection in the thoroughbred and therefore may be critical to the development of the muscle strength phenotype for which thoroughbreds are renowned  <cit> . the p <dig> protein is best known for its role in apoptosis, however, recent studies have suggested that the p <dig> signaling pathway may play a role in regulation of aerobic metabolism with significant reductions in cox <dig> activity in ko mice  <cit> . importantly, p <dig> may regulate the expression of pgc-1α  <cit> .

other kegg pathways that were overrepresented were: arachidonic acid metabolism, involved in the modulation of function of voltage gated ion channels, primarily in neurons and muscle cells  <cit> ; leukocyte transendothelial migration, associated with the inflammatory response and largely coordinated by chemokines  <cit> ; reductive carboxylate cycle , a metabolic pathway; and the renal cell carcinoma signalling pathway, which involves increased cell proliferation, energy demand and o <dig> usage and is stimulated by hypoxia and hif-1α  <cit> .

validation of a panel of genes by real time qrt-pcr
nine genes that were found to be differentially expressed in the microarray experiment were selected for validation by real time qrt-pcr. these genes were chosen based on their involvement in muscle contraction or the response to hypoxia. two probes  that showed differential expression, but were not found within an annotated gene were also included for validation. cx <dig> lies ~  <dig> kb upstream of pfkfb <dig> and was upregulated immediately post-exercise. cx <dig> lies ~  <dig> kb downstream of calmodulin  <dig>  and was upregulated four hours post exercise. the average gene expression of seven of the nine probes studied reached significance  and six  were concordant with the microarray data . a point of major concern in microarray studies is the presence of false positives within a gene list. although the use of qrt-pcr is essential to validate the overall dataset it is not feasible to interpret the experimental findings by evaluating each gene individually. as genes function in co-operation within complex networks we report principally the expression patterns of functionally related groups of genes.

fc t <dig> represents the fold change in gene expression immediately post-exercise.

fc t <dig> represents the fold change in gene expression four hours exercise post-exercise.

there were however, some interesting findings among the validated genes. for instance, the expression of fos showed a high inter-sample variance in gene expression change estimates . the mean expression of the fos gene mrna transcript increased +198-fold. the biological significance of the high gene expression variance for this gene is not clear at present but warrants further investigation.

transcripts for the hspa1a gene and the probe cx <dig>  were significantly increased at t <dig> . while both genes have quite different physiological roles  <cit>  both contain hypoxic response elements  and have been shown to be transcriptionally activated by the hif-1α protein under hypoxic conditions  <cit> .

during the recovery period, four hours post exercise, hspa1a mrna levels remained elevated  while cx <dig> transcript levels returned to baseline . the bhlhe <dig> gene, which increased in expression + <dig> -fold is a transcription factor involved in the hypoxic response, contains a hre and is inducible in hypoxic conditions through interaction with hif-1α  <cit> . calm <dig> and cx <dig> which lies ~  <dig> kb downstream of calm <dig> showed directionally different changes in gene expression. calm <dig> was downregulated - <dig> -fold while cx <dig> was upregulated + <dig> -fold. this is of particular interest as little is known regarding the differential regulation of the individual genes within the calmodulin gene family. calmodulin is a calcium binding protein which acts as a calcium sensor  <cit>  and plays an important role in mediating many cellular processes including muscle contraction  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the thoroughbred horse provides a singular model system to understand exercise adaptations. for the first time following exhaustive exercise we have identified a large number of genes with functions in mechanosensation, muscle hypertrophy, repair and remodelling. the induction of the large numbers of genes with such functions may be explained by the extraordinary innate aerobic and anaerobic capacity of thoroughbreds enabling high intensity exercise even in an unconditioned state leading to proportionally greater stresses on peripheral systems than in other species. importantly it is unlikely this knowledge could be readily gained from human studies as the sustained "all out" effort required to elicit such molecular responses is difficult to attain from untrained/sedentary human subjects, but is naturally achieved by thoroughbreds.

the standard exercise test employed in equine exercise physiology studies requires both endurance and strength, a combination that is not easily reconstructed in other exercise models. the result is that immediately after exercise ribosomal genes are down-regulated indicating decreased protein synthesis, a signature of endurance exercise. however, established responses associated with resistance exercise such as muscle repair and hypertrophy are observed four hours after exercise. although the inhibition of protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy are established responses to endurance and resistance exercise respectively here we detect both responses at a global transcriptional level from a single exercise bout combining both endurance and resistance stimuli.

this study has provided a snapshot of the transcriptional response to exercise in skeletal muscle from a highly adapted system. genes that were differentially expressed immediately after exercise are likely to be directly involved in metabolism and the stress response. four hours following exercise a more general transcriptional response associated with recovery and adaptation was observed, in particular highlighting the roles of genes in metabolism and muscle hypertrophy. further studies are needed to clearly distinguish between the mechanisms associated with the recovery from exercise and return to homeostasis and those that are involved in the long term adaptive response to recurring bouts of exercise conditioning.
