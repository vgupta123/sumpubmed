BACKGROUND
currently, somatic cell nuclear transfer or pronuclear injection is used to generate transgenic domestic animals. these methods are inefficient, and in some species, they are associated with a high risk of developmental abnormalities in the resulting offspring  <cit> . recently, virus-mediated transfer has been employed to generate transgenic animal. viral vectors provide an alternative, efficient mechanism of delivery. however, there is some controversy regarding the efficiency of transmission of exogenous dna by viral vectors, such as retroviruses, adenoviruses and lentiviruses  <cit> . in contrast to retroviruses, recombinant adenovirus-based vectors are able to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells  <cit> . adeno-associated viruses are small, nonpathogenic, dependent parvoviruses that can integrate in a site-specific manner into chromosomes  <cit> . the raav genome can integrate into the host chromosome, facilitating long-term transduction  <cit> . recombinant aav preparations are stable and can be produced at high titers of more than  <dig> particles per ml  <cit> . adeno-associated viral  vectors transduce a variety of somatic tissues, including skeletal muscle, without eliciting an immune response in mice  <cit> . moreover, recent reports have indicated that adeno-associated virusesare capable of integrating the fst gene into the host chromosome and facilitating long-term transduction  <cit> . follistatin  has been demonstrated to be a potent antagonist of other members of the tgf-β family, including myostatin  <cit> . in addition, fst has been shown to be both safe and effective in mice and in nonhuman primates  <cit> . studies have also shown that fst is capable of controlling muscle mass through pathways independent of the myostatin signaling cascade  <cit> . myostatin  negatively regulates myoblast differentiation through activation of the smad, akt, p38mapk and p <dig> pathways  <cit> . antagonists of mstn have shown considerable promise for enhancing muscle mass and strength. mstn inhibits proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, limiting the growth rate and muscle mass in mammals  <cit> . recent studies have highlighted the potential benefit of inhibiting mstn, which results in a double muscle phenotype in mstn-deficient cattle  <cit>  and mstn-knockout mice  <cit> . in particular, because sheep are an economically important animal, breeding double muscle sheep is of high economic value. however, aav-mediated fst gene transfer has not been reported in sheep, whereas there are several reports of fst gene transfer in sheep by other vectors, such as lentiviral vectors  <cit> . the objective of the current study was to use a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype  <dig>  carrying follistatin to explore the effects of fst on ovine primary myoblast  proliferation in vitro. in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that an aav virus carrying the fst gene is capable of inducing myoblast proliferation in vitro. additionally, because we recognized that fst is expressed in opm cells, we verified whether over-expression of fst influences the proliferation of myoblasts irrespective of myostatin. finally, rt-qpcr analysis was carried out to detect the transcript levels of fst, p <dig>  cdk <dig>  akt i and actrii b, which are genes that are thought to play roles that are redundant with mstn for regulating muscle mass. our results demonstrated that the fst gene is capable of inducing the proliferation of opm in vitro. moreover, the findings indicated that in opm, over-expression of fst induced proliferation both directly or indirectly through down-regulation of the p <dig> gene under proliferating conditions.

RESULTS
expression analysis of ovine follistatin and myostatin
to determine whether fst and mstn mrna are expressed in opm, total rna and protein were isolated from opm cells and from ovine fetal skeletal muscle to be used as a control and analyzed using rt-pcr. agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the expression of fst  and mstn mrna . the ovine fst and mstn appeared as a single band on  <dig> %  agarose gels. electrophoresis of the pcr products showed the  <dig> and 151 bp fragments for fst and mstn, respectively. next, western blot analyses were performed on protein extracts to detect fst and mstn protein weight and their properties. total protein was extracted from opm cells that were cultured in growth media in 12-well plates for 72 h. the ovine fst protein appeared as a single band with a molecular weight of 66 kda in sds–page . moreover, anti-mstn antibodies specifically recognized the two following bands: precursor and processed forms of mstn . these two bands corresponded to the unprocessed full-length protein  and the mature processed mstn . however, this 52-kda precursor myostatin was not detectable in muscle extracts. these results indicated that opm cells are capable of synthesizing fst and mstn mrna and protein in vitro.figure  <dig>

to confirm the rt- qpcr results, fst and mstn protein expression were also measured by western blot analysis for opm cultured in gm over an 8-day time-course proliferation. western blot results indicated that mstn and fst protein expression was up-regulated during proliferation. fst protein expression was decreased at day  <dig>  whereas mstn expression remained constant at the end of culture period .

cloning of ovine follistatin
the full-length sequence of the gene encoding fst in opms, containing a 1035 bp segment encoding the  <dig> amino acid, was cloned into a pgem-t vector and sequenced . from the follistatin cds sequence, the amino acid sequence was deduced using software from ncbi. multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences were produced via dnaman  <dig> , as shown in figure 2a. the deduced amino acid sequence of the ovine fst is highly homologous to amino acid sequences of follistatins from ovine , goat , bovine  and human  ovaries.figure  <dig>

follistatin protein is synthesized in transduced myoblast cells
construction of the expression vector is shown in figure 2b. fst cdna was subcloned into paav-ires-gfp, resulting in the recombinant expression plasmid paav-cfs-flag , which was verified via dna sequencing. our results confirmed the expression of ovine fst in the transduced opm cells. as shown in figure 2c, anti-flag monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized a 66-kda band for ovine fst in the transduced opms. the result here for recombinant fst driven by cmv promoter in transduced cells was similar with observed band in figure 1c for endogenous fst.

changes in mrna concentration during myoblast proliferation
to characterize the growth rate of the opm cells, the cells were seeded at 2 ×  <dig> cells/well in 6-well plates and harvested and counted for eight days. the result indicated that the cells entered the logarithmic phase of growth after 2 days and grew extremely slowly after 6 days. some fused cells were observed after 6 days. eight days after incubation, many of the cells were fused and had a long tubular shape . next, to gain insight into the role of follistatin during opm proliferation and to assess the expression of p <dig>  p <dig>  act riib, akt i, cdk <dig>  mstn and fst genes during opm proliferation, total rna was isolated from the opm cells and harvested at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, the cells were harvested at day  <dig> to be used as a control. then, the mrna concentration was quantified by rt-qpcr. we noted that there were no significant changes in act riib mrna expression . as shown in figure  <dig>  fst, mstn, akt i and cdk <dig> mrna concentrations were up-regulated during opm proliferation. the amounts of these genes gradually increased at day  <dig>  after plating and then sharply increased up to day  <dig>  fst, akt i and cdk <dig> mrna levels declined at day  <dig>  after plating, whereas the level of mstn mrna remained constant until the end of the culture period. as shown in figure  <dig>  the maximum expression levels of fst and cdk <dig> were observed at day  <dig>  both genes began to show increased expression after 2 days, reaching a maximum expression at day  <dig>  and exhibited low expression at day  <dig>  moreover, the results showed that the p <dig> and p <dig> mrna concentrations were down-regulated during myoblast proliferation . interestingly, the minimum expression levels of p <dig> and p <dig> were observed at day  <dig> . however, the levels of p <dig> and p <dig> mrna were both increased at day  <dig>  which paralleled the increase in mstn mrna concentration and the reduction in fst mrna concentration at day  <dig>  taken together, these findings strengthened the hypothesis that fst may be involved in the proliferation of myoblasts.figure  <dig>

follistatin over-expression increases proliferation of ovine primary myoblasts
to determine the effect of ovine fst protein on opm cell proliferation, we cultured opm cells for  <dig>   <dig> and 96 h in growth media infected with or without the aav-cfs-flag virus. the cells were fixed and stained with giemsa . opm proliferation was monitored for alterations using a wst- <dig> assay with cell-counting kit- <dig>  reagents. as shown in figure 5b, the optical density  was significantly increased in the transduced opms cultured in gm media after  <dig>   <dig> and 96 h compared with the control, indicating that fst significantly increased proliferation . however, the fst protein induced the growth of myoblasts in a time-dependent manner with half-maximal induction occurring at the 72 h time point . in addition, fst did not cause an increase in myotube formation and overt differentiation .these data indicated that when opm cells were incubated in gm with the aav-cfs-flag virus for 96 h, there was a steady increase in cell number compared to the control . the results strongly suggested that aav-cfs-flag-expressing fst induced a significant effect on cell myoblast proliferation, suggesting that it is involved in modulating myoblast proliferation.figure  <dig>

discussion
recent studies have shown that human myoblast proliferation is induced by an over-expression of fst in cell culture. in addition, fst forms a complex with mstn, preventing its interaction with its receptor and thus blocking the mstn signal  <cit> . in the present study, ovine fst was cloned into the aav <dig> vector, and then aav <dig> virus particles of high titer were obtained. the opm cells were infected by recombinant aav vectors. after total rna and protein isolation, real-time qpcr and western blotting were performed for the opms cultured in the gm. furthermore, a cell proliferation assay was performed using cell-counting kit- <dig>  reagents. the cells were stained with propidium iodide and were analyzed using a flow cytometer for cell cycle progression. the results in figure  <dig> show that the amino acid sequence deduced from the cloned full-length dna sequence of fst contained an n-terminal domain , domain  <dig> , domain  <dig> , domain  <dig> , and a c-terminal region . therefore, the sequence indeed encoded the longest form of fst  <cit> . the western blot analyses showed that the ovine fst protein appeared as a single band with a molecular weight of 66-kda in sds–page , consistent with previous studies  <cit> . in this study, we observed the precursor and the processed mstn at  <dig> and 26-kda proteins, respectively . these observations were consistent with previous reports  <cit> . these results indicated that the mstn protein was indeed synthesized and proteolytically processed in the opms.

to understand the regulation mechanism of mstn and fst protein and their interaction, real-time qpcr analysis was performed on the opm cells undergoing proliferation. moreover, to confirm the rt- qpcr results, fst and mstn protein expression were also measured by western blot analysis. fst and mstn mrna concentrations were up-regulated at mrna  and protein level , whereas p <dig> and p <dig> mrna concentrations were down-regulated during opm proliferation . despite the increased expression of mstn mrna, p <dig> and p <dig> mrna expression was decreased in this condition. it has been thought that increased expression of mstn leads to an up-regulation of p <dig> and p <dig> mrna expression  <cit> . the lack of consistency demonstrated that the fst protein, as a binding protein for mstn, may prevent mstn from binding to receptors on the myoblast cells and thus block the mstn signal  <cit> . however, the rt-qpcr results showed that fst over-expression only down-regulated p <dig> mrna expression and had no effect on p <dig> mrna expression. these results confirmed that fst induces proliferation through a down-regulation of p <dig> because only p <dig> levels were down-regulated as a result of fst over-expression in myoblasts , whereas no change was observed in the level of p <dig> expression  <cit> .

because fst can lead to increased muscle mass  <cit> , it is possible that fst functions by increasing the number of myoblasts during development. to examine this possibility, we incubated myoblast cultures with an aav vector carrying the fst gene. the results indicate that fst indeed induces the proliferation of exponentially growing myoblasts . moreover, because the surviving myoblasts at the end of the assay reflect the net result of cell proliferation, we performed a flow cytometry analysis to assess the cell cycle progression in the transduced myoblasts. the flow cytometry analysis showed that when myoblasts were transduced with the aav-cfs-flag virus, a decreased number of myoblast cells was arrested ing1phase, and therefore, more myoblast cells made the transition to s  phase . consistent with this finding, others have suggested that mstn can inhibit myoblast proliferation  <cit> . investigations into the mechanisms revealed that one of the targets of mstn signaling is the cell cycle. in cell culture studies, mstn inhibited the progression of myoblasts at the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. this cell cycle arrest was shown to be mediated by p <dig>  which was the only cdk inhibitor to be up-regulated by mstn. in addition, myostatin treatment also specifically reduced the levels of cdk <dig>  the combination of which resulted in markedly reduced activity of cdk <dig>  this, in turn, led to the hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and thus inhibited the progression of cells into the s phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . here, in the opms infected with aav-cfs-flag, there was indeed a decrease in p <dig> expression at the transcription level and an increase in cdk <dig> expression  under proliferating conditions, which led to a decrease in the arrest of myoblasts in the g1-phase of the cell cycle. fst likely forms a complex with mstn, preventing its interaction with its receptor and thus blocking the mstn signal  <cit> . thus, the observed increase in the number of myoblast cells is the result of deregulated  myoblast proliferation. these observations are consistent with the model proposed by thomas et al.  <cit>  regarding the role of mstn during muscle growth  <cit> . we propose the following model for the role of fst in myoblast proliferation regulation. in response to mstn signaling, consistent with the up-regulation of p <dig>  cdk <dig> expression is down-regulated, which causes the hypophosphorylation of the rb protein and g <dig> arrest. therefore, these results confirmed the role of fst in myoblast proliferation regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first evidence that an aav viral system can be used for gene transfer in sheep. moreover, the results showed that an aav vector can successfully induce expression of fst in opm cells in vitro. in addition, our findings demonstrated that fst induces proliferation through a down-regulation of the p <dig> gene under proliferating conditions in ovine primary myoblasts. in the future, it would be interesting to determine whether an aav virus can be used to produce transgenic sheep for meat production.
