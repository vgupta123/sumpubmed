BACKGROUND
one of the paradigms of development is the regulation of the genome in a precise and synchronized manner to form a highly complex embryo with diverse and specialized cell types. though the major cell types in the embryo contain the same genetic material, they are very different from each other in both morphology as well as function. the generation of this cellular diversity by the genome is controlled by cis-regulatory elements. cis-regulatory elements are dna elements that are a key component of the genome's non-coding functional sequences and consist of promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and locus control regions . the idea that animal development is regulated by cis-regulatory dna elements is well established and has been elegantly described in invertebrates  <cit> . of the many cis-regulatory elements, enhancers are critical in modulating tissue specific and time dependent gene expression during embryonic development  <cit> . enhancers are thought to consist of clustered target sites for a number of transcription factors and collectively form the genomic instructions for developmental gene regulatory networks. hence any approach to elucidate such networks necessitates the discovery of all constituent enhancer elements and their genomic locations.

the identification and characterization of such cis-regulatory regions within the non-coding region of vertebrate genomes remains a challenge for the post genomics era. traditionally enhancers have been identified through deletion assays  <cit>  and in vitro footprinting  <cit> . but recent advances in sequencing coupled with improved alignment tools have made comparative genomics one of the favored methods for enhancer detection  <cit> .

it is suggested that 1% of the human non-coding genome is at least 70% conserved in the mouse genome over a region of  <dig> bp or longer  <cit> . many such conserved non-coding elements  lie next to critical developmental control genes and have been shown to be developmental enhancers when selected and tested in mice and zebrafish  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that genomic regions that have no sequence level conservation among different species can act as robust developmental enhancers  <cit> . recently chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive sequencing  for p <dig> and chip followed by microarray  on histone modifying mark h3k4me <dig>  has been shown to be useful in identifying tissue specific enhancers on a global scale, many of which have very weak sequence conservation  <cit> . though such studies are a valuable resource they are limited by both the amount of material generated from a particular tissue as well as the availability of a specific antibody. it is also interesting to note that all enhancers are not marked by specific histone marks or co-activator proteins.

our study takes a "gene centric" approach to locate and validate cnes as transcriptional enhancers, thus helping to link an enhancer to gene expression and helping to understand transcriptional control of specific genes in greater depth. we looked for cnes to validate as enhancers around four critical developmental control genes that are expressed in tissues that are ancient in origin and conserved in evolution. we sought to investigate if genes, irrespective of which germ layer they expressed in, followed the general trend of having both sequence conserved and non-conserved enhancers or if there was a bias depending on the germ layer. we picked one gene expressing in ectoderm , one expressing in endoderm  and two from mesoderm . as mesoderm is considered to be of more recent origin  <cit> , we chose  <dig> genes expressing in this particular germ layer to assess whether there was any bias in enhancer conservation due to evolutionary time. we hypothesized that using stringent conservation criteria over large phylogenetic distances will lead to a better filtering out of the functional enhancers from non-functional cnes.

using modified bacterial artificial chromosomes  to detect regulatory elements is highly beneficial when testing for multiple regulatory domains from noncontiguous dna, which act in concert to regulate expression of a gene  <cit> . it has also helped in cases where when the non-coding regulatory dna is not conserved across species and thus not recognizable prior to testing. the success of this approach lies in fact that for genes with multiple expression domains, most of these domains can be observed in a single transgenic embryo as opposed to screening for multiple embryos for individual dna constructs. hence, we also modified the bacs containing the  <dig> genes of interest to locate and validate cis-regulatory elements, which are not conserved at the sequence level.

RESULTS
nkx <dig> 
bagpipe related homeobox containing genes are members of the ancient nk gene family and are highly conserved in sequence and function from drosophila to humans. in mammals it restricts the multipotential mesodermal progenitor to a chondroblast lineage and helps in the development and evolution of the axial skeleton in mouse and has potential role in human skeletal disorders  <cit> . it also has a known role in jaw joint formation and patterning  <cit> . nkx <dig>  has also been detected in the dorsal and anal fin radials of zebrafish as late as  <dig> dpf and in the distal chondrocytes  <cit> . we detected nkx <dig>  expression by rna in situ in the sclerotome and parts of anterior branchial arches at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf .

cnes in and around nkx <dig> 
ucsc genome browser's alignment of sequences near nkx <dig>  in zebrafish revealed four conserved elements around the gene matching our criterion  named bx <dig> to bx <dig> and varied in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . these pieces were co-injected with the minimal promoter-egfp construct into 1-cell zebrafish embryos and observed for egfp expression in the domains of expression of nkx <dig>  in zebrafish at different time points. only one dna element, bx <dig> drove egfp expression that was detected along the antero-posterior axis in the region of the emerging sclerotome and myotome at  <dig> hpf . because transient transgenics in zebrafish tend to produce mosaic expression we did immunohistochemistry with an egfp antibody to detect the exact expression domain of this enhancer as previously described  <cit> . comparison with the rna in situ data at the time point revealed the expression of the enhancer matched that of the endogenous gene . there was no egfp expression from the remaining cnes at the developmental time points under observation. for this gene we also cloned all the four enhancer elements upstream of the promoter in the same order as they are found in the genome and this "mega" construct was also tested. we did not see any significant increase in expression level or domain from all the four enhancers versus only the single functional cne . thus only  <dig> out of the  <dig> cnes functioned as a developmental enhancer at all time points under observation.

nkx <dig>  bac modification
a  <dig> kb bac  containing the zebrafish nkx <dig> gene was identified from the ucsc genome browser and modified by inserting the egfp orf and a selection cassette was inserted just upstream of the translational start site of the gene . this ensured that the all the cis-regulatory elements in the  <dig> kb genomic region around nkx <dig>  that was cloned into the bac were captured in the assay. this modified bac was injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryos and the embryos were followed over its development to detect egfp in domains of expression of nkx <dig> . 70% of the embryos gave distinct expression along the antero-posterior axis as marked by sclerotome/myotome, at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , which correlated with the nkx <dig>  expression as detected by the rna in situ . we were however unable to detect any egfp expression in the branchial arch, which is also a domain of expression for the gene. this led us to conclude that the regulatory elements for this domain lay outside the  <dig> kb genomic dna present in the bac.

pax9
pax <dig> is a member of the paired box  family of transcription factors. members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain, an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. the paired domain consisting of 125- <dig> amino acids, encoded by the paired box, was named after the drosophila pair-rule segmentation gene paired  where it was first identified. there are nine known pax genes in mouse  and also humans . except pax <dig> all other pax genes also are present in zebrafish. in teleost fish there is evidence to suggest that pax <dig> is indispensable for the development of the sclerotome and the neural arch  <cit> . zebrafish pax <dig> expression is initiated at the end of the segmentation period in mesenchymal sclerotome cells on both sides of the notochord. our rna in situ hybridization detected expression of pax <dig> in the dorsal sclerotome and parts of branchial arches at  <dig> hpf  and at  <dig> hpf 

cnes in and around pax9
alignment of the sequences around pax <dig> revealed  <dig> conserved elements matching our criteria ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kb  until there was a synteny break in one or both species that were used in the alignment. six of these pieces were at the 5' end of the gene while five were from the 3' end, with the furthest being  <dig> kb away. three out of these cnes faithfully recaptured egfp expression along the a-p axis as marked by the sclerotome/myotome when co-injected with the minimal promoter-reporter construct. all the three cnes drove expression of egfp along the presumptive sclerotome and myotome at different time points in development. elements px <dig> and px <dig> which were  <dig> and  <dig> kb away from the gene on the 5' end drove expression in the sclerotome and myotome at  <dig> hpf , whereas px <dig> which was  <dig> kb away from the gene at the 3' end drove egfp expression in the same domain at  <dig> hpf . thus 27% of the cnes around pax <dig> were functional in our assay for enhancers.

since all the three functional cnes were expressing in the cells along the antero-posterior axis which contain both the sclerotome and myotome, we did immunohistochemistry for egfp as described previously on the transgenic fish to ascertain the exact tissue which these enhancers were active in. ours results show that all the three enhancers are expressing in the subset of sclerotomal cells which also expresses pax <dig> as seen by rna in situ hybridization. 

branchial arch enhancer of pax9
since pax <dig> expresses in the branchial arch and none of the cnes around pax <dig> could recapitulate the expression data, we decided to locate the enhancer by testing the whole  <dig> kb genomic region lying between the last exon of pax <dig> and the functional enhancer px <dig>  we decided on testing the region on the 3'end of the pax <dig> gene, as the 5' end is gene rich containing nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig> b in close proximity. the 3' end only had one gene slc25a <dig>  which had introns containing large stretches of non-coding dna, and also contained one of the enhancer for pax <dig> . we did overlapping pcrs of about  <dig> bp each to narrow down the enhancer to a  <dig> bp region   that could robustly drive activity in the branchial arch at  <dig> hpf. . this region does not show sequence conservation even with closely related fish species.

pax <dig> bac modification
a  <dig> kb bac  containing  <dig> kb of genomic dna flanking pax <dig> was modified with egfp and injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryo and followed over development. the modified bac recapitulated the gene expression data in the sclerotome and myotome at  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. 70% of the embryos at  <dig> hpf reproduced this expression pattern in dorsal sclerotome consistently .

otx1b
orthodenticle homolog  <dig> is a vertebrate homolog of the drosophila orthodenticle and encodes a member of the bicoid sub-family of homeodomain containing transcription factors. otx <dig> along with otx <dig> has been implicated in the regional patterning of the rostral head and both are synergistic in function in certain domains of the brain. the otx <dig> gene has been strongly associated with the formation of the otic vesicle in gnathostomes starting with the teleost fish and hence helping in transition from the jawless vertebrates to a more gnathostome characteristics  <cit>  and also in determining cerebellar cell identities in zebrafish  <cit> . our rna in situ hybridization detected expression of otx1b in neural plate at  <dig> hpf  and forebrain, midbrain and otic vesicle at  <dig> hpf 

cnes in and around otx1b
genome alignment revealed  <dig> cnes in the syntenic block around otx1b . all the cnes were present on the 5' end of the gene with the farthest being  <dig> kb away. there was no synteny at the 3' end of the gene with mouse and human genomes. ox <dig> strongly recapitulated the gene expression at  <dig> hpf at the neural plate . both ox <dig> and ox <dig> that are adjacent to each other and about 8- <dig> kb away from the gene drove egfp expression in the forebrain at  <dig> hpf . we did not detect any egfp expression from the other cnes when they were assayed individually with the reporter construct. thus 19% of the conserved elements assayed in our system were positive as tissue specific enhancers.

otx1b bac modification
the  <dig> kb bac  containing the otx <dig> gene was modified with a reporter and was injected into the 1-cell fertilized zebrafish embryos as previously described. the egfp expression could be detected as early as  <dig> hpf in the neural plate . an individual cne also drove reporter gene expression in the same tissue at the same time point and was present in the genomic region cloned in the bac under testing. 69% of the injected embryos also showed egfp expression in the forebrain midbrain and otic vesicle at  <dig> hpf, which overlapped with the endogenous gene expressions at the time point observed by rna in situ . we detected a much more extensive expression domain for the bac as compared to the individual cnes, thus leading us to believe that there exist more regulatory elements in that genomic region than detected by sequence level constrain.

foxa2
foxa <dig> is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family and is specifically expressed in the visceral endoderm, anterior definitive endoderm, node, notochord and floorplate  <cit> . in zebrafish it has been shown that although foxa <dig> is not required for the induction of the floorplate, it is required for its further differentiation and for induction and/or patterning of several distinct cell types in the ventral cns  <cit> . our rna in situ hybridization detected expression of foxa <dig> along the forebrain and the pharyngeal endoderm at  <dig> hpf .

cnes in and around foxa2
using our criteria, we located six cnes around foxa <dig>  all of which were located at the 3' end of the gene, the closest being  <dig> kb away and the farthest being  <dig> kb away and ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp . each of these cnes was individually ligated with the reporter construct and the injected embryos were visualized at different time points in development. two of the cnes, fx <dig> and fx <dig> could drive expression in the forebrain at  <dig> hpf . there was no detectable expression of egfp from the other individual cnes at the time points under observation. so only 33% of the cnes assayed were functional as developmental enhancers in zebrafish.

foxa <dig> bac modification
the  <dig> kb bac  containing the genomic insert in and around zebrafish foxa <dig> was modified and injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryos. the bac recapitulated the endogenous gene expression particularly in the rostral end of the embryo in the forebrain and pharyngeal endoderm at  <dig> hpf . we failed to detect egfp expression in any other foxa <dig> expression domains.

bac dissection to detect non-conserved enhancers
since many of the cnes failed to act as enhancers coupled with the fact that our data on pax <dig> as well as previous studies reported the presence of non-conserved enhancers  <cit>  we sought to investigate in a detailed manner if we could locate more such functional non-conserved enhancers. since most of our modified bacs gave us expressions that were more extensive than the individual cnes alone, we employed the traditional method of bac dissection. we selected the otx1b bac for these experiments as the modified bac for this gene had shown a robust spatio-temporal expression, recapitulating substantial domains of expression of the endogenous gene . the bac was digested with the restriction enzyme xbai, which generated  <dig> fragments ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb in size . the fragments were individually ligated to the minimal reporter construct and injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryo. three fragments gave egfp expression in the fore and/or mid brain of the zebrafish embryo at  <dig> and  <dig> hours. two of the positive fragments each contained a functional cne in them . the third fragment, a  <dig>  kb piece from the 3' end  of zebrafish otx1b gene mapped to a large region that included introns and exons of a predicted gene . also this fragment was conserved in among the fishes-fugu and tetraodon. this element was functional in our assay expressing in forebrain and otic vesicle . the fact that it mapped to such a large region that included exons led us to believe that the core element might be smaller. this  <dig>  kb  regulatory element was further reduced into five overlapping  <dig> bp and one  <dig> bp fragment by pcr . the overlapping pcr fragments ensured we did not have abrupt breakpoints in the dna fragments. these six fragments  were individually tested by co-injection with the minimal reporter construct into zebrafish embryos and one  of the  <dig> bp fragments  partially recapitulated the expression domain of the bigger  <dig>  kb fragment at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . there was no expression from the other  <dig> fragments. nc <dig> showed partial conservation to the tetraodon and fugu genome. nc <dig> was further reduced to five   <dig> bp fragments by doing overlapping pcrs and each piece was individually injected with a reporter construct . fragment nc2c  on its own could drive expression of egfp reporter in a subset of the expression domain of nc <dig> , which was a subset of the expression domain of the  <dig>  kb fragment in the forebrain and otic vesicle. interestingly the nc2c  <dig> bp fragment had no conservation with any species in the genome alignment. thus we concluded that this element was a zebrafish specific enhancer for otx1b. we also observed that reducing the size of the dna resulted in a slight reduction both in the domain of expression as well as the level of expression in the embryo. one possible reason for this reduction in expression domain was that, although the small  <dig> bp fragment contained most of the transcription factor binding sites essential for its function, it was missing some other binding sites which were in the neighboring fragments and the extensive expression domain as seen by the  <dig>  kb fragment is result of the synergistic activity of multiple transcription factors interacting with the regulatory element.

biochemical and transgenic assays to detect a core binding site
seven overlapping cy <dig> labeled dna probes were designed to span the  <dig> bp otx1b non-conserved enhancer  . the probes were incubated with nuclear extract from  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos and run on a native gel . two out of the seven fragments showed a distinct shift indicating that they contained sites for transcription factor binding . both of these fragments were co-injected with the egfp reporter construct into 1-cell zebrafish embryos. one of the fragments  could drive egfp expression to the rostral portion of the brain, recapitulating a subset of the expression domain of the bigger  <dig> bp fragment . the other fragment  that bound protein in vitro did not show any activity in vivo.

we made "sliding"  <dig> bp mutations  along the  <dig> bp  region to narrow down the binding site . mutations in nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig>  completely abrogated binding of the protein with weakened binding observed for mutations in nucleotides 26- <dig> . injection of the egfp reporter construct harboring the mutant  <dig> bp binding sites independently in the zebrafish showed weakened egfp expression but not complete loss of activity . this led us to believe that the nucleotide 21- <dig> together harbored the functional site in the enhancer. we went ahead and designed mutant probes for the whole  <dig> bp  region and emsa and transgenic assays showed a complete abrogation of binding and markedly reduced egfp expression in the zebrafish embryos . this gave conclusive proof that the actual binding site and the core functional domain of the non-conserved enhancer lay within these  <dig> nucleotides.

enhancer binding transcription factor
we used the transfac database   <cit>  to find potential transcription factors  that could bind to the  <dig> bp sequence in our non-conserved enhancer. by using a criterion of entire matrix similarity >  <dig>  we came up with a list of  <dig> putative transcription factors that could bind the sequence: foxa <dig>  pbx <dig>  and lef <dig> . we performed supershift assays with antibodies against the potential tfs and saw a supershift uniquely with the foxa <dig> antibody . to conclusively prove that foxa <dig> was critical for the functioning of the enhancer we designed  <dig> morpholinos against foxa <dig> and co-injected the morpholinos with the  <dig> bp non-conserved enhancer construct. whereas the scrambled morpholino  did not have any effect on the enhancer and recapitulated the expression of the enhancer alone , knocking down foxa <dig> resulted in a dramatic reduction of the enhancer activity by both the morpholinos . to verify if foxa <dig> was indeed knocked down in the morphants, we did western blots, as previously described  <cit> , to detect proteins levels of foxa <dig>  the western blots indicated that both the morpholinos used against foxa <dig> resulted in dramatic decrease in levels of foxa <dig>  which were not seen in the scrambled morpholino control . to test if downregulation of foxa <dig> and decreased activity of the otx1b enhancer actually led to a dramatic drop in expression of otx1b we did rt-pcr on rna extracted from both wild type as well as morphant embryos at  <dig> hpf  as well as rna in situ for otx1b in both these embryos . there was no discernable expression change detected by pcr or in situ, strongly suggesting that the expression of otx1b at  <dig> hpf is also controlled by other functional enhancers thus the abrogation of activity of one regulatory element does not lead to significant drop in its expression. hence our data suggests that foxa <dig> is important in driving the activity of otx1b in the forebrain and otic vesicle in zebrafish via a redundant enhancer which is not conserved at the sequence level.

discussion
this study focused on examining cnes directing expression of four developmental control genes that are ancient in origin and conserved during evolution and expressed in the three different germ layers. this allowed us to ask two very important questions regarding the nature and role of these conserved elements:  are all the conserved elements found in the syntenic region around a gene functional?  can we find all the enhancers for a particular gene by looking only at the cnes? the cnes selected for our study were selected based on a criteria of ≥ 60% sequence identity and ≥  <dig> bp in length across three phylogenetically distant species . as the teleost fishes and mammals last shared a common ancestor about  <dig> million years ago, predating the emergence of the majority of all extant vertebrates, it strongly implied that any non-coding sequences conserved between these two groups are likely to be fundamental to vertebrate life and hence functional. the design of our study has also allowed us to address some major arguments which have been put forward before to explain the absence of functionality in these cnes in human-mouse comparative studies. by being able to look at potentially all developmental time points we had an advantage over most of the studies where the functional testing was done in mouse and was restricted to one developmental time point  <cit> . yet our data clearly indicates that even dna elements that are conserved very stringently over long evolutionary time might not have functional roles as enhancers during development. the fact that many of these conserved non-coding elements are non-functional as enhancers and non-conserved dna can be functional is not totally unexpected. previous studies  <cit>  by other groups looking at single genes also revealed similar trends in other genomic loci in the zebrafish. conversely it has also been shown that absence of sequence level homology does not preclude a fragment of dna from being functional as a developmental enhancer  <cit> . thus our data supports the hypothesis that in zebrafish many of the enhancers for important developmental control genes are not constrained at the sequence level.

we have also demonstrated that there is still a need to combine high throughput comparative genomics with detailed biochemical assays to locate and validate cis-regulatory elements in the vertebrate genome. by doing such detailed assays on one of the non-conserved enhancers we have demonstrated that putative transcription factor binding sites and the actual transcription factor binding to an enhancer can be determined with great accuracy and can lead to a more complete analysis of an enhancer. though a recent study discovered motifs in zebrafish enhancers, they only predicted what putative transcription factors could bind them  <cit> , we went beyond only prediction and actually validated the responsible transcription factor. we believe our study will help in opening the door for future studies looking in finer detail at individual enhancers and how they control gene expression.

we have also shown the utility and efficiency of using bac transgenics in zebrafish to locate and validate distal cis-regulatory elements for different genes. bacs have been successfully used to validate cis-regulatory elements for numerous genes in mouse  <cit>  and in certain cases multiple overlapping bacs have been used to locate all the regulatory elements of a gene  <cit> . bac modification for transgenics has also been employed for a few zebrafish genes in the past  <cit> . we have done an extensive spatio-temporal gene expression study of bac transgenics for four critical developmental control genes. thus we have demonstrated that circular modified bacs can be used without linearization for large-scale transgenic studies in zebrafish making it an attractive model system for similar future studies.

finally it has not escaped our attention that only about 20-30% of the cnes tested were functional as developmental enhancers. most of these fragments could indeed be non-functional but alternately other possible explanations exist. one possibility is that these elements are acting in a synergistic manner and require other elements together to function. this was also demonstrated by our bac studies, which show much more extensive expression patterns as compared to the individual cnes. also the possibility exists that these cnes could be negative regulatory elements and hence our assay fails to capture this activity. some recent results from other groups have indicated the same for the human genome  <cit> . also other functions such as chromatin attachment sites, mirna genes or splice regulatory regions may also reside in such highly conserved non-coding sequences  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
thus it is becoming increasing clear that the degree of sequence conservation is not a measure of how 'important' or 'crucial' a functional element might be, but its relevance is shaped by the underlying molecular mechanisms that determine its particular function. hence as we demonstrated here, future needs will be to combine evolutionary, functional and bioinformatic approaches to understand how these sequences function at the molecular level to determine the nature of these interactions and finally decipher what 98% of our genome encodes.
