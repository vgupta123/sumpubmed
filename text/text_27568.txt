BACKGROUND
three structurally and functionally distinct dna polymerases, known as dna polymerases α, δ, and ε , are required for chromosomal dna replication in yeasts  <cit> . the complex structure of each pol α, -δ, and -ε is well conserved from yeast to human  <cit> , thus their function inside the cell is also believed to be conserved  <cit> .

dna primase initiates dna replication by synthesizing a short oligo-ribonucleotide primer which is immediately elongated by pol α to form short rna-dna fragments on both leading and lagging strand of dna. pol δ elongates the short rna-dna fragment initiated by pol α-primase to make a mature okazaki fragment  <cit> . to carry out processive dna synthesis in vitro, pol δ requires pcna and its loader, replication factor-c   <cit> . in cooperation with fen1p , dna2p and rpa, pol δ also plays a crucial role in processing rna-linked okazaki-fragments in budding yeast  <cit> .

although the precise role of pol ε in vivo is still unclear, it has been implicated in dna replication, repair, recombination, and mitosis  <cit> . pol ε has at least one essential function in both budding and fission yeasts  <cit> , and several lines of evidence suggest that pol ε plays an essential catalytic role during chromosomal dna replication. yeast cells harboring a temperature-sensitive pol <dig> allele are temperature sensitive for growth and express a thermolabile pol ε dna polymerase activity  <cit> . furthermore, pol2p is associated with replication forks during s phase  <cit>  and pol <dig> mutants fail to complete chromosomal dna replication  <cit> . furthermore, 3'–5' exonuclease-deficient mutants of pol <dig> and pol <dig>  accumulate strand-specific lesions in chromosomal dna  <cit> . these observations support models for chromosomal dna replication in which pol ε and pol δ play leading strand- and lagging strand-specific roles during chromosomal dna replication, respectively. pol ε has been proposed as the leading strand dna polymerase because pol ε is a highly processive polymerase without pcna  <cit>  and pol <dig> mutants have defects in maturation of okazaki fragments  <cit> . nevertheless, it has been reported that the amino-terminal portion of budding yeast pol ε , which includes motifs required for dna polymerase and exonuclease activities, is dispensable for dna replication, dna repair, and viability  <cit> . however, this conclusion is controversial, because the polymerase active domain mutant  is lethal  <cit>  and our studies showed that the deletion mutant confers temperature-sensitivity for growth, a defect in dna elongation, premature senescence, and short telomeres. furthermore, this pol2p deletion is lethal in combination with temperature-sensitive cdc <dig> and with exonuclease-deficient pol δ . these results suggest that pol ε plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity  <cit> .

in higher eukaryotes, the function of pol ε is much less clear than in s. cerevisiae, although some reports showed that pol ε is required for cellular chromosomal dna replication  <cit> . in order to understand how pol ε involves in higher eukaryotic chromosomal dna replication, we have been characterizing dna replication catalyzed by xenopus egg extracts  <cit> . we have shown previously that both the initiation and elongation steps of chromosomal dna replication are markedly impaired in pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts, resulting in significant reduction of the overall dna synthesis as well as accumulation of small replication intermediates. moreover, despite the decreased dna synthesis, excess amounts of pol α are loaded onto the chromatin template in pol ε-depleted extracts, indicative of the failure of proper assembly of dna synthesis machinery at the fork  <cit> . although these experiments clearly demonstrate that pol ε is required for a normal chromosomal dna replication in xenopus egg extracts, they did not give any answer whether dna polymerase activity of pol ε directly involves in chromosomal dna replication process.

in the present report we show that the reconstituted and purified xenopus pol ε holoenzyme, which is proficient in dna polymerase activity, fully complements dna replication defect of pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts, but neither dna polymerase domain deleted pol ε holoenzyme, dna polymerase-dead-pol ε holoenzyme, the catalytic subunit of pol ε, nor other subunits of pol ε holoenzyme complements the defect at all. these results clearly prove that the dna polymerase activity of pol ε holoenzyme directly participates in chromosomal dna replication in xenopus egg extracts and that the products made by pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts are not fully replicated dna.

RESULTS
isolation of cdna encoding each subunit of xenopus pol ε holoenzyme
a previous study reported cloning of a partial cdna for the catalytic subunit  of xenopus pol ε   <cit> , and in this report, the corresponding full-length cdna was cloned by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends  . the fact that the full length cdna encodes a  <dig> amino acid residue protein whose predicted amino acid sequence is 81% identical to human p <dig>  <cit>  and 62% identical to s. cerevisiae pol2p  <cit>  within the polymerase domain  confirms the identity of the cloned fulllength cdna. full length cdna encoding p <dig> and p <dig> of xpol ε were also cloned using 3' race, xenopus ovary mrna and partial cdna clones  <dig>  and pbx0037b <dig> , respectively. the predicted amino acid sequences of p <dig> and p <dig> showed very high similarity to p <dig> and p <dig> of human pol ε, respectively  <cit> , confirming the identity of the cloned cdnas. cdna encoding p <dig> of xpol ε holoenzyme was cloned previously  <cit> ; thus, with this report, full length cdna clones have been isolated for all four subunits of xpol ε holoenzyme.

the c-terminal zinc finger domain of p <dig> is required for binding p <dig> but not p12-p17
deletion mutants of xpol ε p <dig> were constructed and used to identify protein regions involved in the interfaces between p <dig> and the other subunits of pol ε holoenzyme. for these experiments, p <dig> deletion mutants were fused to the flag epitope tag  and the following mutants were generated:  flag-p260full,  flag-p260Δc <dig>   flag-p260Δc <dig>   flag-p260d860n, and  flag-p260Δcat . the p <dig> mutants were co-expressed with xpol ε p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> using a baculovirus insect cell expression system and immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibodies. figure 1b shows that anti-flag antibodies co-immunoprecipitated p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> from crude extracts of insect cells expressing wild type p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  in contrast, in cells expressing p260Δc <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with the catalytic subunit but p <dig> did not, and in cells expressing p260Δc <dig>  no other subunits of pol ε holoenzyme co-immunoprecipitated with the p <dig> mutant protein. these results suggest that p <dig>  but not p <dig> or p <dig>  interacts with p <dig> residues  <dig> to  <dig>  which includes zinc-finger motifs , and that p <dig> and p <dig> interact with a motif or region between residues  <dig> and  <dig> of p <dig> . both p260d860n  and p260Δcat did not interfere with formation of the xpol ε holoenzyme, because all four pol ε subunits co-immunoprecipitated from cells expressing these p <dig> mutants. in cells expressing histidine-tagged p <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig>  ni2+ -chelating beads only precipitated h-p <dig>  indicating that h-p <dig> does not interact directly with p <dig> or p <dig>  or both subunits , although it was known that both subunits interact each other and form a 1: <dig> complex in insect cells  as s. cerevisiae dpb3p-dpb4p complex  <cit> .

dna polymerase activity of xpol ε holoenzyme is required for dna synthesis in xenopus egg extracts
previous studies suggested that the amino-terminal portion of yeast pol ε is dispensable for dna replication, dna repair, and viability. because this portion of the enzyme includes all known dna polymerase and exonuclease motifs, these results suggest that the dna polymerase activity of pol ε is dispensable for chromosomal dna replication in yeast  <cit> . to investigate this possibility further, the xpol ε mutant complexes described in figure  <dig> as well as partial holoenzyme complexes lacking specific subunits were purified from insect cells and used in an in vitro xenopus chromosomal dna replication system with pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts. the following xpol ε holoenzyme complexes were used:  wild type r-xpol ε holoenzyme,  pol ε-dn containing p260d860n,  pol ε Δcat containing p260Δcat,  p260p <dig> sub-complex of xpol ε,  p260-p12-p <dig> sub-complex of xpol ε, and  p <dig> . the specific activity of each enzyme complex is summarized in table  <dig>  although we did not measure the specific activity of p260-p <dig> and p260-p12-p <dig> sub-complexes, they were similarly purified as r-xpol ε holoenzyme and p <dig> and might be the same specific activity as that of p <dig> alone. pol ε-dn and pol ε Δcat holoenzymes do not have any significant dna polymerase activity as predicted, although a slight contaminating dna polymerase activity could be detected . this may be due to contamination of insect dna polymerase activity. it should be noted here that recombinant xpol ε holoenzyme complexes  purified from insect cells had minor contaminants, and all enzyme preparations except flag-tagged p <dig> included p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> in amounts that were detected by immunoblotting.

xpol ε holoenzyme interacts with xcdc45p, xcut5p, and xgins
previous studies suggested that cdc45p, cut5p, and gins are critical for loading pol α and pol ε onto dna replication origins and for initiating chromosomal dna replication in yeast and xenopus egg extracts  <cit> . however, those studies did not show any direct interaction between these initiation proteins and pol ε holoenzyme. therefore, in this study, we tested this possibility by measuring physical interactions between r-xpol ε holoenzyme and xcdc45p, xcut5p, and xgins. the experiments were performed by incubating r-xpol ε holoenzyme with these proteins and immunoprecipitating protein complexes with anti-flag antibody. figure 5a shows that xgins was co-immunoprecipitated with pol ε holoenzyme from reactions containing r-xpol ε holoenzyme and recombinant xgins  <cit> . addition of xcdc45p, but not xcut5p  <cit> , slightly disrupted the complex between r-xpol ε holoenzyme and xgins , and incubation of xcdc <dig>  xcut5p, and xgins in the absence of r-xpol ε holoenzyme resulted in formation of a heterotrimeric complex lacking xpol ε holoenzyme . xcdc45p also interacts directly with xpol ε holoenzyme in vitro , and the amount of this complex decreased slightly in the presence of xgins, but not in the presence of xcut5p . these results suggest that the trimeric xcdc45/xcut5p/xgins complex interacts with xpol ε holoenzyme, and this interaction may involve direct contacts with xcdc45p and xgins but not with xcut5p .

xgins stimulates xpol ε-holoenzyme-catalyzing dna synthesis
previous studies demonstrated a direct interaction between yeast gins and yeast pol ε holoenzyme and that this interaction stimulates the rate and processivity of dna synthesis by pol ε holoenzyme  <cit> . a similar result was obtained using r-xpol ε and r-xgins  <cit> . as observed previously for yeast gins, maximum stimulation by xgins was obtained at a stoichimetry of 5– <dig> xgins/xpol ε . under these conditions, however, xcdc45p or xcdc45p plus xcut5p did not stimulate the rate or extent of dna synthesis by r-xpol ε holoenzyme .

discussion
previous genetic studies in yeast suggested that pol ε plays an important role during chromosomal dna replication  <cit> . however, because the amino-terminal portion of pol ε, that is required for its dna polymerase- and exonuclease activities, is dispensable for yeast dna replication, repair, and viability  <cit> , the role of pol ε during dna replication has remained obscure. this study explores this role using an in vitro xenopus dna replication system and wild type and mutant forms of r-xpol ε holoenzyme. here we show that the dna replication defect in xpol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts is readily corrected by native   or recombinant xpol ε  holoenzyme or the p260-p <dig> pol ε sub-complex, but not by p260Δcat holoenzyme, p <dig> dn, p <dig> or p260-p12-p <dig> . because the former enzymes are polymerase proficient, while p260Δcat holoenzyme and p <dig> dn are polymerase-deficient, although these preparations contained a small amount of dna polymerase activity, and the last two sub-complexes do not contain the second essential subunit of xpol ε holoenzyme , these results clearly demonstrate that the dna polymerase activity of pol ε holoenzyme is required for chromosomal dna replication in xenopus egg extracts. note that both p260Δcat and p <dig> dn holoenzymes partially complements dna replication defect of xpol ε-depleted egg extracts . however, these dna synthesis activities never reach to the levels of either mock-depleted-, n-xpol ε holoenzyme-, or r-xpol ε holoenzyme-supplemented egg extracts even after long time incubation , thus we conclude that those residual activity of dna synthesis upon addition of catalytically dead polymerases is not significant to the key issue of this paper.

we do not know why n-xpol ε holoenzyme preparations always exhibit higher specific activity of dna polymerase than that of r-xpol ε holoenzyme , although both polymerase holoenzymes equally complement the defect of the pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts . however, we noticed that the reconstituted r-xpol ε holoenzyme is much more volatile than n-xpol ε holoenzyme during purification . thus, it is possible that r-xpol ε holoenzyme purified from insect cells would not be fully activated yet and it might be activated during incubation with xpol ε-depleted egg extracts by unknown mechanism and function in the egg extracts as does n-xpol ε holoenzyme.

the previous studies showed that a yeast strain consisting of a deletion of the amino-terminal portion of pol2p  is temperature-sensitive for its growth, has a defect in elongation of dna replication, has a short cell senescence, has a shorting telomere length, and is synthetic lethal with temperature-sensitive cdc <dig>  mutations and with the 3'-5' exonuclease minus pol δ mutant pol3- <dig>  suggesting that pol ε is required primarily for maintenance of genome integrity and that the dna polymerase activity of pol ε might be substituted by the remaining polymerase, if the polymerase domains are completely missing  <cit> . however, the requirement of xpol ε holoenzyme for chromosomal dna replication in xenopus egg extracts is much more strict than that of yeasts and pol εΔcat holoenzyme cannot restore dna synthesis activity of pol ε-depleted extracts to the levels of mock-depleted extracts  and residual dna synthesis observed in pol ε-depleted extracts is not authentic chromosomal dna replication, unlike yeast systems  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that the dna polymerase activity of pol ε holoenzyme is strictly required for normal chromosomal dna replication in higher eukaryotes, including xenopus, but it may not be absolutely required for chromosomal dna replication in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, which have a relative small chromosomal dna.

if the above analysis is correct, then it is important to determine whether pol ε holoenzyme participates in leading or lagging strand dna synthesis. although the present study does not answer this question, previous studies are consistent with a role for pol ε in leading strand dna synthesis  <cit> . furthermore, cdc45p and gins associate directly with mcm2–7p, a dna helicase that works at the replication fork, in yeast, xenopus, and drosophila  <cit> , and xpol ε also associates directly with xgins, xcdc45p, and xcut5p, as shown in this study. xgins, like yeast gins, also stimulates dna synthesis catalyzed by xpol ε. thus, it is very likely that the dna polymerase activity of xpol ε holoenzyme, plus xcdc45p, xgins and xmcm2–7p, perform a coordinated function at the replication fork in xenopus egg extracts. we propose that this function is required for leading strand dna synthesis  <cit> , while lagging strand dna synthesis in xenopus may be carried out by pol δ, pcna, rf-c and pol α-primase as well as fen1p, dna2p, rpa, dna ligase and rnase h  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that the dna polymerase activity proficient xpol ε holoenzyme complements dna replication defect of the pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts. however, neither the dna polymerase-domain-deleted xpol ε, dna polymerase-dead-xpol ε, the catalytic subunit of pol ε nor other subunits of pol ε without the catalytic subunit complements the defect at all. furthermore, we show that xpol ε holoenzyme directly interacts with xcdc <dig>  xcut <dig>  and xgins, which are required for the initiation of chromosomal dna replication in xenopus egg extracts. these results are the first, direct and biochemical evidence that the dna polymerase activity of xpol ε holoenzyme is absolutely required for chromosomal dna replication in higher eukaryotes, unlike in yeasts.
