BACKGROUND
botrytris cinerea has been considered the second most important plant pathogenic fungus according to its economic and scientific importance  <cit> , and is able to infect more than  <dig> plant species including many with high agronomic value  <cit> . the genome of two b. cinerea strains have been sequenced  <cit>  and one of its key features is the prediction of a high number of secretory proteins, about 10% of the polypeptides coded by the genome. proteomic studies have actually revealed an abundant and diverse set of proteins in the extracellular medium for b. cinerea cultures  <cit> . this set contains mainly proteins involved in the degradation of plant structures , but also proteins with other functions such as the induction of cell death in the host  <cit> , as well as plenty of proteins with unknown function  <cit> . the role of some of these extracellular proteins has been studied by gene knock-out to identify secretome members contributing to virulence, i.e. virulence factors, but only a few have shown to contribute modestly to the infection process  <cit> .

it is known that o-glycosylation is crucial in determining the structure and function of numerous secreted and membrane-bound proteins  <cit> . carbohydrate chains have been proposed to enhance the stability and solubility of proteins, to confer protection against proteases, to act as a sorting determinant, and to be involved in various development and differentiation processes  <cit> . we have recently shown, by an in silico approach, that about half of predicted proteins in fungal secretomes display ser/thr-rich regions, i.e. regions with at least 40% ser/thr in a minimum of  <dig> contiguous residues  <cit> , which are usually considered to display high-density of o-glycosylation  <cit> . indeed, about one fourth of secretory proteins were predicted to display hyper-o-glycosylated regions, i.e. regions with at least 25% of residues predicted to be o-glycosylated  <cit> . in fungi, o-glycosylation begins with the addition of a mannose residue by protein o-mannosyltransferases  in the lumen side of the endoplasmic reticulum  membrane  <cit> , a process which has recently been shown to occur, at least partially, concomitantly with the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the er  <cit> . three pmt families exist in fungi   <cit> , and filamentous fungi usually have only one pmt gene per family. the deletion of one or more of the pmt genes usually results in loss of viability or strong defects such as reduced conidia production, changes in fungal morphology, etc., emphasizing the importance of o-glycosylation for the fungal biology. the b. cinerea genome also contains three pmt genes  <cit> , bcpmt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the three of them, but especially bcpmt <dig>  are critical for the stability of the cell wall, are necessary for sporulation, and are required for the generation of the extracellular matrix. besides, bcpmts are also required for full virulence in a variety of hosts, with a special role in the adhesion to, and penetration of, intact plant leaves  <cit> .

since pmts have been found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> , but not in plants, these proteins are promising targets in the design of novel control strategies against fungal phytopathogens. however, the er-associated topology of these proteins  <cit>  poses strong problems for the elucidation of their structure and the design of specific inhibitors. an indirect approach is the identification of specific pmt substrates that could also be important for fungal biology and virulence. since we have previously observed significant changes in the patterns of protein secretion and glycosylation by the bcpmt mutants  <cit> , we have addressed here the characterization of glyco-secretome differences between wild-type b. cinerea and bcpmt mutants.

RESULTS
many proteins in the b. cinerea secretome are glycosylated
we have previously identified more than one hundred proteins in the b. cinerea secretome  <cit> , and we have also observed that the appearance of the secretome in 1d- and 2d-page changes radically for mutants affected in pmts, which catalyse the first step of o-glycosylation  <cit> . this prompted us to better characterize the set of glycoproteins secreted by wild-type b. cinerea strain b <dig> , as well as by the mutants lacking each one of the three b. cinerea pmts  <cit> . preliminary observations allowed us to establish static liquid cultures in petri dishes with ygg-low medium, inoculated with mycelial plugs and incubated for 4 days, as the optimum conditions to maximize isolation of secretory proteins in the case of Δbcpmt mutants. culture media obtained from these plates contained plenty of proteins  and the band pattern in sds-page was different for the wild type and for the Δbcpmt mutants. purification of glycoproteins from the culture medium by affinity chromatography with concanavalin-a resulted in quite different band patterns , with some proteins clearly disappearing and others being enriched. notably, the band corresponding to the most abundant protein in the secretome of b. cinerea, the 35-kda aspartic protease bcap <dig>  <cit>  , is completely absent after purification of glycoproteins, in accordance with the fact that no n- or o-glycosylated sites are predicted in silico for this protein by the netnglyc  <dig>   <cit>  and netoglyc  <dig>   <cit>  servers. moreover, an enrichment in proteins with high molecular weight  was observed for all samples after glycoprotein purification, in agreement with the fact that lectin-blot experiments also show that glycosylation is more prominent for these proteins  <cit> . as expected, the sds-page band pattern of purified glycoprotein samples is different for the wild type and the three Δbcpmt mutants, especially in the case of Δbcpmt <dig> and Δbcpmt <dig> figure  <dig>

2d electrophoresis of purified glycoproteins was carried out for b <dig>  and the Δbcpmt <dig> mutant, and resulted in a relatively simple spot pattern , with not too many differences for the two samples. some spots, however, showed clear differences in intensity, such as spot  <dig>  which is over-expressed in the Δbcpmt <dig> sample. a total of  <dig> spots obtained from the wild-type or the Δbcpmt <dig> 2d gels were excised and analyzed by maldi-tof/tof, resulting in the identification of  <dig> proteins . in some cases , the same protein was identified in several spots forming charge trains , or even in spots  with different mobility in the second dimension .figure  <dig>

identification of glycoproteins in the secretome by lc-ms/ms
the purified glycoprotein samples obtained for the four strains were also analyzed by shotgun proteomics. the total number of proteins identified was  <dig> in the four samples . only one of the  <dig> proteins identified previously from the 2d electrophoresis gels  was not identified by lc-ms/ms, so the total number of glycoproteins identified by the two methods is  <dig>  most proteins identified  showed signal peptide according to signalp  <dig>   <cit> , and  <dig> others showed alternative secretion features according to secretomep  <dig>   <cit> . forty-eight of the  <dig> proteins are described here for the first time as components of the b. cinerea secretome, while the rest have been reported previously  <cit> .

contrary to our initial expectations, the composition of the glyco-secretome was not radically different for the wild type and for the three Δbcpmt mutants, so that proteins clearly absent in one or more of the mutants, and therefore putative substrates of the corresponding bcpmt, are scarce. restricting the comparative analysis to highly expressed proteins , so that the number of spectral counts accumulated for each protein makes the comparison more significant, it results that the  <dig> proteins considered are all expressed in the three Δbcpmt mutants, as well as in the wild type. only two proteins, pectin methylesterase bcpme <dig> and b0510_ <dig> , have an abundance of less than 25% that of the wild type in at least one of the mutants. noticeably, some of these proteins are actually found at elevated levels in the mutants, in comparison with the wild type. overall, these results confirm a prominent role for pmts in protein glycosylation, but in a way that may be more complex than anticipated. it does not seem, for example, that individual proteins are substrates of only one bcpmts.table  <dig>

ser/thr-rich and highly o-glycosylated regions in glycoproteins
we have recently analyzed in sílico the presence and distribution of ser/thr-rich regions, as well as hyper-o-glycosylated regions, in the predicted b. cinerea secretome  <cit> . we now have the opportunity to compare those results with a similar analysis for the experimental set of actually secreted and glycosylated proteins reported here . the results show, in first place, that ser and thr residues are extremely abundant among secreted glycoproteins. on average, 38% of residues in these proteins are either ser or thr in the experimental glycoprotein set, while this number is just 17% for the whole predicted secretome. when the ms excel xrr macro described previously  <cit>  was used to study if these residues are grouped forming ser/thr-rich regions  a big number of these was found, even when a very high ser/thr content was necessary for a region to be considered as ser/thr-rich . the proportion of proteins displaying ser/thr-rich regions was considerably higher for the experimental set of glycoproteins than for the predicted whole secretome . for example, 80% of glycoproteins displayed regions with at least 40% ser/thr, while only 46% of proteins in the whole predicted secretome exhibited them . moreover, the total number of ser/thr-rich regions was comparatively higher for the glycoprotein set: among the  <dig> glycoproteins  <dig> ser/thr-rich regions  were found, almost  <dig> per protein, while the whole predicted secretome  contained only  <dig> of these ser/thr-rich regions. notably, seven proteins were found with regions of 20– <dig> residues in which at least 80% of them are ser or thr.figure  <dig>

similar results were obtained when glycosylation was predicted for the set of purified glycoproteins. both n-glycosylation and o-glycosylation was predicted for most of them , but the average number of predicted o-glycosylated residues in proteins was about three times higher than the number of n-glycosylated ones. the predicted o-glycosylation positions were frequently grouped in highly-o-glycosylated regions , but not the n-glycosylation sites . using the less stringent definition of highly-o-glycosylated regions , it results that about half of proteins  in the glyco-secretome display these kind of regions, about twice the number obtained for the whole predicted secretome   <cit> .

we observed previously, for the whole predicted secretome, that ser/thr-rich and predicted highly o-glycosylated regions have a tendency to be located toward the two ends of polypeptide chains  <cit> . this tendency is clearer in the case of glycoproteins and especially evident for predicted highly o-glycosylated regions , which are frequently found in the c-terminal region of proteins and are also common at the n-terminus right after the signal peptide.

interestingly, we found a relationship between the presence of predicted hyper-o-glycosylated regions in proteins and their relative abundance in the secretomes of the Δbcpmt mutants, estimated from the spectral counts. this was done by first choosing a set of abundant proteins, for which we could calculate more reliable fold changes from spectral counts, consisting of  <dig> proteins with at least  <dig> spectral counts in one of the four botrytis strains and a relative abundance of at least 1% in one of the four strains. the fold change in the amount of protein in the Δbcpmt mutants, relative to the wild type, was then estimated from the spectral counts for each individual protein. next, the average fold change was calculated separately for those proteins with predicted hyper-o-glycosylated regions and for those without them, and are displayed in figure 4d. statistically significant differences were found for the two groups in the three mutants, so that the relative abundance of proteins predicted to have hyper-o-glycosylated regions is, on average,  <dig>  times higher in the secretomes of the Δbcpmt mutants than in the secretome of the wild type. on the contrary, no difference was observed for the proteins without predicted hyper-o-glycosylated regions.

one possible explanation for the fact that proteins displaying hyper-o-glycosylated regions tend to be found at higher levels in the secretomes of the Δbcpmt mutants is that o-glycosylation causes retention of the proteins in the cell wall or the extracellular matrix. these proteins, being glycosylated to a less extent in the Δbcpmt mutants, would escape easier and accumulate to higher levels in the culture medium. to test this hypothesis, two fusion proteins were expressed in b. cinerea which both contained the sequence of bcspl <dig>  <cit> , an abundant component of the b. cinerea secretome partially retained in the cell wall  <cit> , fused to gfp, but differed in the presence of a ser/thr-rich region in the c-terminal end originally coming from the endoglucanase cel5a  <cit> . unfortunately, the level of expression seemed quite different for the two fusion proteins, as judged from the green fluorescence in the mycelium  and from the western-blots with monoclonal anti-gfp antibodies , and both gave various bands in the western-blot. by considering all the bands obtained in the blots, we determined for liquid cultures of each of these two strains the ratio of protein secreted to the culture medium versus the amount associated with the mycelium . although the effect of the introduction of the ser/thr-rich tail in the protein was not spectacular, the fusion protein displaying it showed a higher tendency to be associated with the mycelium which was statistically significant in the three repetitions of the experiment shown in figure 5c.figure  <dig>

overexpression of o-glycosylated proteins in b. cinerea
three of the proteins detected as components of the glyco-secretome were overexpressed in b. cinerea to further study them. these proteins were selected because they display ser/thr regions and are glycosylated in different degrees . the three proteins were the endopolygalacturonase bcpg <dig>  previously reported to be required for full virulence in b. cinerea  <cit>  and to be perceived as a pamp  by arabidopsis  <cit> , and two proteins of unknown function that we have named bcieb <dig>  and bcsun <dig> . these proteins differed in the number or length of the ser/thr-rich regions, with bcsun <dig> being predicted to be highly glycosylated by netoglyc  <dig>  and the other two poorly glycosylated .

expression of the three genes under the control of the strong promoter olic resulted in the accumulation of decent amounts of proteins in the culture medium . in order to check if, and how, these proteins were glycosylated we treated them with two glycosyl hydrolases: exo α1- <dig>  and exo α1- <dig> mannosidases. since all attempts to purify them from the culture media were unsuccessful, the treatment was done with a whole secretome sample and analyzed by western-blot with anti-c-myc antibodies . reduction of protein size, as a consequence of treatment, was considerable for bcsun <dig> , limited for bcieb <dig> , and not detectable for bcpg <dig>  in good accordance with the number of glycosylation sites predicted for the three proteins:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . this reduction was seen only for the incubation with the exo α1- <dig>  enzyme. treatment with exo α1- <dig> mannosidase did not produced any effect by itself nor did it potentiate the effect of exo α1- <dig> . these results indicate, therefore, that at least bcsun <dig> and bcieb <dig> are actually glycosylated, that the amount of sugars incorporated is in accordance with the predictions carried out by netoglyc, and that glycosidic chains contain primordially mannoses linked by α1- <dig> or α1- <dig> glycosidic bonds. additionally, the same strategy was used to assess the incorporation of mannose residues to the bcspl1-gfp-st fusion protein described above , and also in this case treatment with exo α1- <dig>  mannosidase  produced a considerable reduction in size, but not in the case of the control fusion protein bcspl1-gfp.figure  <dig>

culture media from the three strains overexpressing the o-glycosylated proteins were also tested for the ability to elicit defense responses in plants by seedling growth inhibition assay  <cit> , a sensitive and quantitative test which correlates with typical plant defence responses such as callose deposition, production of reactive oxygen species, or pathogenesis-related gene expression  <cit> . in this assay, culture media from the three overexpressing strains revealed considerably more efficient in inhibiting growth of tobacco seedling, as compared with the media obtained with the wild-type strain . moreover, the seedlings treated with media from the overexpressing strains showed necrotic symptoms that were clearly more intense than with the wild-type strain.figure  <dig>

discussion
o-glycosylated proteins are crucial components of fungal secretomes. not only has it been predicted that more than half of secretome components display o-glycosylation sites  <cit> , frequently in the form of highly-o-glycosylated regions, but it has also been shown that mutants affected in the first step of the o-glycosylation machinery display a vast arrays of defects including decreased virulence in the case of phytopathogens  <cit> . by purification and identification of glycoproteins, we have shown here that b. cinerea indeed secretes a substantial amount of these proteins. altogether,  <dig> proteins were identified in the isolated glycoprotein sample for the wild-type strain b <dig> , which include  <dig> proteins for which experimental evidence is provided here, for the first time, as components of the secretome. it is worth noting the absence, among these proteins, of the aspartic protease bcap <dig>  whose band is not detected in sds-page of the purified glycoprotein sample  nor does it appear among the  <dig> proteins identified by lc-ms/ms for the same sample. this protein serves as an internal negative control for the purification of glycoproteins, since it is the most abundant protein in the secretome  <cit>  but it lacks predicted glycosylation sites. its absence in the purified sample indicates that the purification is working properly. family distribution of glycoproteins  is not very different from that obtained for the whole secretome sample  <cit> , with a low number of proteins classes containing most of the proteins: mainly proteases, polysaccharide hydrolases, oxidoreductases, and plenty of proteins with unknown functions. it does not seem, therefore, that glycosylation acts preferentially on specific types of proteins.

contrary to what we expected, the composition of the glyco-secretome was not very different for the wild type and the three Δbcpmt mutants affected in o-glycosylation. we reasoned that lack of glycosylation of specific proteins in one or more of the Δbcpmt mutants would prevent its retention by the lectin affinity column and so would result in its absence in the corresponding glycoprotein sample. although there are plenty of proteins  which are absent in one or more of the four strains, these correspond almost always to those with just one or a few spectral counts, so that their absence/presence may be the result of mere chance. the comparison of spectral counts for those proteins with the highest expression , however, does not show any protein which is absent in the mutant samples. this may indicate, at least for these proteins, that they are not substrates of single pmts  but are glycosylated by the combined action of several of them. pmts have been shown to act as specific dimers in saccharomyces cerevisiae, pmt1/pmt <dig> heterodimer and pmt4/pmt <dig> homodimer  <cit> , and as almost all possible hetero- and homo-dimeric combinations in aspergillus nidulans  <cit> . our results agree better with the situation in a. nidulans, since a more promiscuous association of pmt monomers, to form functional dimers, would inherently imply an easier substitution of one of the pmts by the other isoforms.

surprisingly, more often than not, spectral counts for the most abundant proteins are higher in the Δbcpmt mutants than in the wild-type strain b <dig>  , possibly because proteins correctly glycosylated are retained easier in the cell surroundings  while those with an incomplete glycan structure escape easier. it was actually shown  that proteins predicted to have hyper-o-glycosylated regions are, on average, more abundant in the glyco-secretomes of the Δbcpmt mutants, as compared with the wild type, while the same is not true for the proteins not predicted to have hyper-o-glycosylated regions. moreover, addition of a ser/thr rich region to a fusion protein expressed in b. cinerea increases the amount of it that remains associated with the mycelium , as compared with the amount found in the extracellular medium, although these results need to be taken with caution because of the different levels of gfp expression in the two strains. if confirmed, this effect of glycosylation maybe physiologically important for b. cinerea, as enzymes acting on soluble substrates and producing assimilable nutrients for the fungal cells may be more efficient if retained closer to the cells.

the overexpression of three of the proteins predicted to be o-glycosylated allowed experimental confirmation of the post-translation modification for two of them, as a decrease in the apparent molecular mass observed in sds-page was caused by enzymatic deglycosylation . although prediction of o-glycosylation carried out by netoglyc is only approximate for fungal proteins  <cit> , the changes in the apparent molecular mass obtained for the three proteins are in accordance with the number of o-glycosylation sites predicted . incubation with two different deglycosylation enzymes showed the presence of mannose α1- <dig> and/or α1- <dig> bonds , but no mannose α1- <dig> bonds were detected. these results are in agreement with the glycosyl linkages observed for other fungal and yeast proteins, usually displaying mannose α1- <dig> and α1- <dig> linkages  <cit> . although mannose α1- <dig> bonds have been observed in other fungi such as aspergillus  <cit> , they either do not exist in b. cinerea, at least in the proteins analyzed, or their contribution to the proteins molecular weight is not significant.

the extracellular media obtained after growing the strains overexpressing the three glycoproteins showed an enhanced ability to elicit plant defenses, as detected in seedling growth inhibition assays . this was not surprising in the case of bcpg <dig>  since this proteins has recently been shown to be recognized as a pamp by the arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor rbpg <dig>  <cit> , but was completely unexpected for the other two. it is tempting to speculate that it is the sugar fraction on these proteins the part responsible for the elicitation of the plant defenses, since this feature is shared by the three proteins, but clearly the alternative explanation, i.e. different amino acid sequences in the three proteins act as elicitors, cannot be ruled out at this point.

CONCLUSIONS
b. cinerea secretes plenty of glycosylated proteins belonging to a diverse set of families, with polysaccharide hydrolases, proteases, and oxidoreductases being the most abundant groups. as expected, ser/thr-rich regions, considered to be substrates of the o-glycosylation machinery, are twice more abundant in the glyco-secretome than in the whole secretome. surprisingly, proteins predicted to be hyper-o-glycosilated are more abundant in the glyco-secretomes of o-glycosylation deficient mutants, possibly because o-glycosylation causes retention in the cell wall or extracellular matrix. o-glycosylated proteins seem to have a prominent role in plant-pathogen interaction, since the independent overexpression of three of them in b. cinerea increases elicitation of plant defenses by the fungus.
