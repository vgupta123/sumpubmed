BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains the most common opportunistic infection for people living with human immunodeficiency virus , and a leading cause of death in low and middle-income countries  <cit> . the number of new tb cases has tripled in countries where the incidence of hiv is high in the last two decades  <cit> . at least one-third of the  <dig>  million people living with hiv worldwide are infected with tb and have up to 15% risk of developing tb every year, compared to those without hiv who have a 10% risk over their lifetime  <cit> . in mexico, hiv-infected patients account for  <dig> % of new tb cases  <cit> . in other developing countries, it has been reported that in hiv-infected patients, mycobacterium tuberculosis  is not the only mycobacteria that causes disease, nontuberculous mycobacteria  have also been found in such patients  <cit> . in mexico identification of mycobacterial species is generally based on clinical features, sometimes with the help of a positive acid-fast stain  <cit> .

since the discovery of polymorphic dna in mtb, molecular typing of strains has become a valuable tool in tb epidemiological studies allowing investigators to track epidemics, detect new outbreaks, and achieve better knowledge of strain movement distinguishing between reinfection and relapse  <cit> . is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism  typing of mtb has been used extensively in studies of tb transmission and is one of the most widely applied and standardized molecular typing methods  <cit> . spacer oligonucleotide typing  is another molecular genotyping technique; it is fast, robust, reliable, easy to perform, and cost-effective  <cit> . spoligotyping is based on the analysis of the direct repeat  loci, which are comprised of directly repeated sequences interspersed with non-repetitive spacer dna  <cit> . this rapid pcr-based method allows the classification of strains into spoligotype families based on the presence or absence of spacer regions  <cit> . the most promising pcr-based methods are based on the analysis of multiple loci containing variable numbers of tandem repeats  of different families of interspersed genetic elements, collectively called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units   <cit> . currently, the most commonly used version of this method  is based on the analysis of  <dig> loci  <cit> . some authors have found that this method shows a discriminatory power equivalent to that of rflp and for this reason it has been considered an alternative method to is6110-rflp for epidemiological studies  <cit> . one of the most alarming trends concerning tb is the emergence of drug-resistant mtb strains, which have become a worldwide health care problem  <cit> . the number of multidrug-resistant strains of mtb , defined as resistant to at least isoniazid  and rifampin , has been steadily increasing over the years, and several outbreaks have been reported  <cit> . the development of resistance to these two drugs reduces the efficacy of standard antituberculosis treatment to 77%. for this reason it is important to identify resistant strains as soon as possible to permit adjustments in treatment and minimize transmission of drug-resistant strains. mutations in the catalase peroxidase gene   <cit>  and in a gene encoding the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase   <cit>  have been found to account for  <dig> to 70% and  <dig> to 15% of inh-resistant mtb strains, respectively  <cit> . mutations resulting in a single amino acid change within the 81-bp core region of the rna polymerase β-subunit  gene are found in 96% of rif-resistant mtb strains  <cit> .

the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of mycobacterial species in hiv-infected patients from mexico city and surrounding areas, to evaluate the genotypic diversity of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  strains using is <dig> rflp, spoligotyping and miru-vntr, to determine their drug resistance profiles, and to detect mutations present in katg, inha and rpob genes that lead to the selection of inh- and rif-resistant strains.

RESULTS
mycobacteria prevalence in hiv-infected patients
in this study we characterized  <dig> mycobacterial strains isolated from hiv-infected patients, 85% of strains belonged to the mtc;  <dig>  were mtb,  <dig>  m. bovis, and the remaining 15% were ntm:  <dig>  corresponded to m. avium and  <dig>  to m. intracellulare. thirty mtb strains  were isolated from pulmonary specimens, while  <dig> of  <dig> m. avium strains  were isolated from extrapulmonary specimens. thirteen patients presented more than one site of infection .

rflp analysis
rflp analysis of all mtb strains was performed using is <dig> as probe. the is <dig> fingerprint patterns generated were highly variable. the number of is <dig> copies per strain varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  of is <dig> fingerprint patterns observed,  <dig>  were unique, indicating epidemiological independence , and  <dig> strains  lacked is <dig> . these patterns  were confirmed by performing a second rflp analysis where mtb h37rv was included as control strain. additionally,  <dig> strains  were clustered in  <dig> groups consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> strains with identical is <dig> rflp patterns, presumably representing cases of recent transmission, and  <dig>  strains presented is <dig> rflp patterns with five bands or fewer.

spoligotyping
to determine lineage, the  <dig> strains  from the mtc were spoligotyped and binary outcomes were compared with the shared type  number and lineages and sublineages reported by brudey et al  <cit> . spoligotype analysis of  <dig> mtb strains yielded  <dig> patterns . thirty-nine mtb strains  were grouped into  <dig> clusters  while  <dig> strains showed unique patterns. thirty-four mtb strains showed  <dig> spoligotyping patterns that matched with: shared-type  number  <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and st <dig> . a further  <dig> mtb strains showed  <dig> patterns that did no exist in the spoldb <dig>  database . spoligotyping allows discrimination of mtb strains with low-copy-numbers of is <dig> . nine m. bovis strains yielded  <dig> spoligotyping patterns;  <dig> unique patterns and  <dig> clusters with  <dig> strains in each one . the m. bovis spoligotyping patterns matched with st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and  <dig> new patterns were identified .

miru-vntr patterns
clustering of miru-vntr patterns by the upgma method showed a greater diversity of patterns in the mycobacterial strains studied. a total of  <dig> patterns were produced from  <dig> mtb strains,  <dig> clusters were identified . the remaining  <dig> strains showed unique patterns. nine m. bovis strains produced a total of  <dig> patterns ,  <dig> cluster was identified with  <dig> strains, while  <dig> strains presented unique patterns.

genomic diversity of mtb isolates
the discriminatory power of miru-vntr typing was compared to that of is <dig> rflp and spoligotyping by analyzing only mtb strains. overall, miru-vntr typing discriminated  <dig> different patterns ; in comparison, only  <dig> different patterns were obtained with is <dig> rflp and  <dig> patterns were obtained with spoligotyping. miru-vntr typing performed even better than a combination of spoligotyping and is <dig> rflp, which discriminated  <dig> patterns. the maximal discrimination was apparently achieved by combining miru-vntr and is <dig> rflp typing, resulting in  <dig> patterns.

spoligotypes could often be distinguished by miru-vntr typing; for instance, the single st <dig> spoligotype corresponded to  <dig> distinct miru-vntr genotypes . by contrast, just three of the miru-vntr patterns  were distinguished by spoligotyping.

genomic patterns of mycobacterial strains isolated from the same patient
identical spoligotyping and rflp patterns were found among each set of strains in  <dig> out of  <dig> patients that were infected with more than one mtb strain . only one patient  had two strains that differed in both, rflp and miru-vntr typings, suggesting that, this particular patient was infected with two different strains of mtb. regarding m. bovis strains, patients  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were infected with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different strains according to their spoligotyping and miru-vntr typing. each of patients  <dig> and  <dig> were infected with two m. avium strains; but whether these are different strains remains to be determined.

phenotypic drug resistance testing
a total of  <dig> strains  were subjected to colorimetric microplate alamar blue assay . testing indicated that  <dig> m. bovis strains were susceptible to the  <dig> drugs tested, while  <dig>  mtb strains showed resistance to one or more drugs . only one  mtb strain was mdr, and  <dig>  of them were resistant to str. as none of m. bovis strains showed resistance to the  <dig> antibiotics tested, no further characterization was carried out on them. no phenotypic or genotypic drug resistance tests were carried out in ntm.

genotypic drug resistance testing
mutations in katg, inha and rpob associated with resistance were found in  <dig>  mtb strains. our study shows that strains isolated from hiv-infected patients not only have mutations in regions of genes previously shown to be involved in drug resistance, but also have mutations that have not been previously reported. the nucleotide and amino acid changes identified in the drug resistant strains are shown in the table  <dig>  among the inh-resistant strains,  <dig> strains had a mutation agc → acc at codon  <dig> of katg gene , corresponding to the most common mutation found in inh-resistant strains  <cit> . the mdr strain had substitution mutations agc → acc  at codon  <dig> of katg and tcg → ttg, at codon  <dig> of the rpob gene, resulting in a predicted amino acid change of ser → leu. one rif-resistant isolate had a mutation gag → tcg  at codon  <dig> of the rpob gene that has not been described previously. there was no correlation between the mutations and genotyping patterns of different strains in this study, i.e. the inh-resistant mtb strains  had the same substitution mutation agc → acc  at codon  <dig> of the katg gene, however they differ in the spoligotyping, is <dig> rflp and miru-vntr patterns .

discussion
in this study we analyzed  <dig> mycobacterial strains isolated from hiv-infected patients attending different hospitals in mexico city. diagnosis of mycobacterial infection in mexico is based on clinical symptoms with ziehl-neelsen staining  being the only laboratory confirmation of infection currently in use. many patients are treated for mtb purely on the basis of a positive afb test and in most cases strains are not tested for ntm due to the procedure for this characterization being lengthy and expensive. the incomplete identification of mycobacterial species producing infection can have serious consequences, resulting in longer hospitalization times, increased risk of nosocomial infections and selection of mdr strains. delayed diagnosis is a key factor contributing to the unnecessary deaths of many people living with hiv. more importantly proper identification of mycobacterial species causing infection leads to more appropriate antimicrobial treatment  <cit> . in agreement with results from a previous study by molina-gamboa et al  <cit> , we found thatmtb was the most prevalent mycobacterial species identified in hiv-patient samples investigated in this study. of the  <dig>  million patients globally-infected with mtb in  <dig>  an estimated  <dig>  million  were hiv positive  <cit> . at least one-third of the  <dig>  million people living with hiv worldwide are infected with tb and individuals infected with hiv are  <dig> to  <dig> times more likely to develop tb than those without the virus  <cit> . although mtb is the most important etiological agent of tb, m. bovis, can also be considered a potential cause of human cases, especially in developing countries where control measures for bovine tb in cattle and/or milk dairy products are not always satisfactory  <cit> . with the advent of hiv, bovine tb represents an additional risk for hiv-infected patients. importantly, pulmonary or extrapulmonary tb caused by m. bovis, may be underestimated due to the fact that the resulting infection is clinically indistinguishable from that caused by mtb. in this study  <dig> % of strains isolated were identified as m. bovis. our results are consistent with those reported by cicero et al  <cit> , who also identified m. bovis in extrapulmonary samples  from hiv-infected patients in mexico. in an earlier study, molina-gamboa et al  <cit>  identified m. bovis in  <dig> % of patients with hiv using only biochemical tests.

although in the past two decades ntm infections have been regarded as a growing concern, mainly as a result of the aids epidemic, these microorganisms were first recognized in the 1950s when the prevalence of tb fell after the introduction of antimycobacterial therapy  <cit> . ntm produce both pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects  <cit> . in this study, 15% of isolated mycobacterial strains were ntm. the mycobacteria identified in this study belonged to the mac complex: m. avium-m. intracellulare, findings which are consistent with those reported by molina-gamboa et al  <cit> , who identified these mycobacteria as the second most prevalent acid-fast bacilli isolated from hiv-infected patients in mexico. countries with limited resources like mexico do not identify mycobacteria by culture and molecular techniques and because of this infections caused by ntm are under diagnosed or misdiagnosed. this study emphasizes the need for molecular identification of ntm in hiv-infected patients.

rflp analysis based on is <dig> insertion is used to define clusters of mtb strains with identical dna fingerprints. however, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies in mexico that have used is <dig> rflp analysis to characterize mtb strains isolated from hiv-infected patients. using this method we showed wide genetic variability in mexican strains . our results are similar to those reported in countries like tanzania where yang et al  <cit>  obtained  <dig> patterns from  <dig> mtb clinical strains and in switzerland, where strässle et al  <cit>  identified  <dig> different patterns from  <dig> mtb strains isolated from hiv-infected patients. our findings differ from reports of the numbers of different mtb strains isolated from non-hiv population within endemic regions, where it has been shown that variability in is <dig> patterns is low  <cit> . the contrasting wide diversity of mtb strains from hiv-infected patients found in tanzania, switzerland and now in mexico, might be explained by these patients having a deficient immune system, and thus providing the perfect habitat for the development of infection regardless of mycobacterial virulence  <cit> .

in the present study we identified  <dig> mtb strains  with five or fewer copies of is6110;  <dig> of these  lacked is <dig>  mtb strains with low is <dig> copy number have been more frequently isolated from asian patients than from european patients. for example, 56% of the strains collected from india and  <dig> to  <dig> % of the strains collected from vietnam, thailand and malaysia contained five or fewer is <dig> elements  <cit> , whereas the frequencies of low-copy-number strains in denmark and france were 11% and 8%, respectively  <cit> . in the united states, analysis of strains from texas, california, and colorado reported 25% containing fewer than six is <dig> copies  <cit> . the reports of the incidence of strains with low copy number insertions from the united states are closer to the incidence of the mexican strains isolated in our work.

in this study,  <dig> mtb strains produced  <dig> spoligotyping patterns, while  <dig> m. bovis produced just  <dig> patterns. quitugua et al  <cit>  had reported the spoligotype  <dig>  in  <dig> patients from texas, this pattern was identified in  <dig> strains in our study. likewise, the octal  <dig>  which was identified in  <dig> patients who live on the border of mexico  and united states , was identified in  <dig> strains in this study. other octals found by quitugua et al and also in our work, were  <dig>  and  <dig> , confirming that there are some strains of mtb circulating between mexico and united states. the spoligotypes st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> identified in this study, have been found in others countries including brazil, south africa and poland  <cit> , suggesting that these strains might be circulating worldwide. furthermore, the st <dig> spoligotype has also been isolated from egyptian mummies  <cit> ; this spoligotype is one of the most common patterns and, according to a hypothesis about the evolution of mtb strains by loss of drs  <cit> , close to the origin of development of mycobacterial diversity.

the st <dig> spoligotype found in m. bovis strains isolated in this study has also been found in cattle from juarez city and chihuahua   <cit>  and has been frequently isolated from cattle in australia, argentina, england, france and ireland  <cit> . the pattern of transmission of m. bovis to hiv-infected patients is still under study; however, the identification of the same spoligotype patterns in both cattle and hiv-infected patients indicates that, as is generally accepted, ingestion of contaminated milk or dairy products is the most probable origin of infection  <cit> .

this study is the first in mexico where genetic diversity of mycobacterial strains has been evaluated using miru-vntr. the  <dig> mtb strains investigated in this report produced  <dig> distinct patterns by miru-vntr while  <dig> m. bovis strains produced  <dig>  analysis of these results showed that most of these patterns were unique, consistent with other studies conducted in singapore and belgium, where there was wide variability in mtb strains  <cit> . as expected, most of clusters based on spoligotyping or low is <dig> copy number fingerprinting could be distinguished by miru-vntr. additionally, in strains isolated from hiv-infected patients,  <dig> miru  were showed to have a different pattern compared with those occurring in the population without hiv; miru  <dig> and  <dig> in strains isolated from hiv-infected patients presented with low polymorphism, while those identified from individuals without hiv have a high polymorphism. by contrast, miru  <dig> and  <dig> of strains from hiv-infected patients have a high polymorphism, while those from individuals without hiv showed a low polymorphism  <cit> . these differences might be useful for the differentiation and classification of strains that can only infect hiv patients.

some authors have found that miru-vntr based on a 12-loci set  format have limitations in its discriminatory power  <cit> . recently, two miru-vntr formats  have been developed to improve the discriminatory power of miru- <dig>  <cit> , and found a better discriminatory power using the set of 15-loci  with  <dig> mtb isolates. however, in our study, the miru- <dig> allowed us to demonstrate a high genetic diversity in mycobacterial strains belonging to the mtc; in order to get a more definitive answer to this matter, more genotyping analysis should be carried out with mtb strains from different origins.

since all isolates were collected from hiv-infected patients, we suggest to analyze mtc strains from non vih-infected patients from the same region in order to enhance the significance of our results.

mdr tb is an increasing problem worldwide  <cit> . infection with mdr mtb is associated with significant mortality  <cit> , and has resulted in a number of serious outbreaks  <cit> . colorimetric microplate alamar blue assay  assays demonstrated that all isolated m. bovis strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. on the other hand,  <dig>  isolated mtb strains were resistant to one or more antibiotics. these results are very close to those obtained by peter et al  <cit> , who demonstrated that 41% of the mtb strains isolated from patients from baja california  were resistant to at least one antibiotic. our study showed that  <dig> % of the strains we identified were mdr, confirming the incidence of mdr tb in mexico already reported by the who  <cit> . the highest proportions of strains were resistant to str, as has also been reported to be the case in africa for both hiv-infected and patients without hiv  <cit> . due to the importance of inh and rif, which are the most effective antibiotics against tb, we determined the mutations that lead to the selection of resistant strains in our study. three inh-resistant strains showed a mutation agc → acc  at codon  <dig> of katg gene, a finding consistent with several studies, which have shown that this mutation is the most frequently associated with this resistance  <cit> . in our country, this mutation seems to be as frequent  <cit> , as in other countries such as russia and brazil  <cit> . in this study, no correlation was found between genotypic drug resistance and genotypic patterns, findings which were consistent with those previously reported for mtb strains isolated in both hiv-infected and non hiv-infected patients  <cit> . on the other hand, one rif-resistant isolate had a mutation gag → tcg  at codon  <dig> of rpob gene, which has not been previously described, and which should be the object for further study of other strains in mexico.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first molecular analysis of mycobacteria isolated from hiv-infected patients in mexico, which describe the prevalence of different mycobacterial species in this population. using a combination of different molecular techniques a high genetic diversity of mtb strains was identified. new spoligotypes and miru-vntr patterns as well as a novel mutation associated to rif-resistance were found. this information will facilitate the tracking of different mycobacterial species in hiv-infected individuals, and monitoring the spread of these microorganisms, leading to more appropriate measures for tb control in these patients.
