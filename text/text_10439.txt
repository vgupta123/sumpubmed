BACKGROUND
the dissemination of tumor cells from their primary site of growth to distant organs is the major cause of morbidity and death among cancer patients  <cit> . thus, inhibition of invasion and metastasis of cancer cells is of great importance in the treatment of cancer. cancer cell invasion and metastasis is considered to be a complex, multi-step process, during which malignant cells detach from their point of origin, migrate and invade surrounding tissues, enter the vasculature, circulate and reach secondary sites, extravasate and establish metastatic foci  <cit> .

one well-characterized property of invasive tumors is their ability to accelerate the degradation of the extracellular matrix, by matrix metalloproteinases   <cit> .this degradation provides access to the vasculature and lymphatic system, allowing tumor dissemination. mmps have increased expression and activation in almost all human cancers <cit> . more specifically, mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are of particular interest because in addition to gelatin they degrade type iv collagen, the basic component of the basement membrane, which is the main barrier separating in situ and invasive carcinoma  <cit> .

the heat shock protein  <dig>  is a molecular chaperone which exists in mammalian cells in two isoforms that share 86% aminoacid conservation . it is one of the most abundant cytoplasmic proteins in unstressed cells, where it performs housekeeping functions, controlling the activity, intracellular disposition and proteolytic turnover of a variety of proteins. over the past years there has been increasing evidence that hsp <dig> interacts with a great number of molecules intracellularly, that are involved in the development and/or survival of cancer cells  <cit> , allowing mutant proteins to retain or gain function, while permitting cancer cells to tolerate the imbalanced signaling that such oncoproteins create. recently, we and others have identified a pool of hsp <dig> at the cell surface, where it was shown to be involved in cancer cell invasion  <cit> . additionally, we have reported results showing that a monoclonal antibody  recognizing both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig>  mab 4c <dig>  inhibits melanoma cell invasion and metastasis by binding selectively to the surface pool of hsp <dig>  <cit> . finally, we have presented data indicating that surface hsp <dig> interacts specifically with the extracellular domain of her- <dig> and that this interaction which is necessary for the receptor's activation leading to breast cancer cell invasion, is disrupted by mab 4c <dig>  <cit> .

taking all the above into consideration together with previous data showing that hsp90α is secreted from fibrosarcoma cells and promotes their invasive capacity through association with mmp <dig>  <cit> , in the present work we sought to investigate the secretion of both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig> in the conditioned medium of mdamb <dig> human breast cancer cells and their possible interaction with mmp <dig> and/or mmp <dig>  furthermore and after taking into account our previously mentioned recent data showing that mab 4c <dig> inhibits mdamb <dig> human breast cancer cell invasion in vitro by disrupting the association of cell surface hsp <dig> with her- <dig>  <cit>  in this work we examined: a) the effect of mab 4c <dig> on mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> secretion and activation b) the ability of this antibody to disrupt the interaction of extracellular hsp <dig> with mmp <dig> and/or mmp <dig> and c) the capacity of mab 4c <dig> to inhibit in vivo, the formation of metastatic deposits of mdamb <dig> cells in the lungs of scid mice.

RESULTS
both the α and β isoforms of hsp <dig> are secreted by mdamb <dig> breast cancer cells and interact with mmp <dig> and mmp9
in order to investigate the secretion of the α and β isoforms of hsp <dig> by mdamb <dig> cells, cell lysates and concentrated supernatants derived from the culture of these cells were analyzed by western blotting using mab 4c <dig> which recognizes both isoforms of hsp <dig> <cit> , and the commercially available anti-hsp <dig> α and anti-hsp <dig> β antibodies. as shown in figure 1a, both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig> are secreted by mdamb <dig> cells. the absence of beta actin in the supernatant fraction  demonstrates that there is no contamination of the culture supernatants with the intracellular components of cells during the experimental procedure. at this point it is important to note that beta actin was never detected in any of the concentrated supernatants used in the experiments described hereafter .

an important characteristic of invasive tumors is their capacity to accelerate the degradation of extracellular matrix by mmps  <cit> . mmps are secreted as inactive pro-enzymes and are activated extracellularly by proteolysis  <cit> . we thus next examined the possible interaction of the secreted pool of hsp <dig> with mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  after confirming the presence of both pro-mmp <dig> and pro-mmp <dig> as well as their activated forms in the culture medium of mdamb <dig> cells , we showed by immunoprecipitation experiments in the culture supernatant using anti-mmp <dig> and anti-mmp <dig> antibodies followed by western blot analysis with antibodies against the α and β isoforms of hsp <dig>  that indeed both isoforms of hsp <dig> interact with the metalloproteinases examined . in order to further clarify the interaction of extracellular hsp <dig> with the mmps studied, reverse co-immunopercipitation experiments were performed. our results showed that both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig> interact with the inactive pro-mmp <dig> and pro-mmp <dig> . interaction with the mature forms of the corresponding metalloproteinases was also detected .

mab4c <dig> prevents mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> activation and disrupts their interaction with both the α and the β isoform of extracellular hsp90
based on our observation that presence of both the inactive and mature forms of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> were detected in the concentrated supernatants derived from mdamb <dig> cell cultures, we next examined the effect of mab 4c <dig>  the function blocking anti-hsp <dig> antibody, on the secretion and activation of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  analysis of concentrated supernatants derived from mdamb <dig> cells, with zymography, showed that when  <dig> μg/ml of mab 4c <dig> were included in the culture medium, presence of the inactive pro-enzymes was not affected, while detection of the activated forms of both mmps was not obtained . these results were confirmed using antibodies against the metalloproteinases, and western blot analysis . at this point it is important to note that addition of mab 4c <dig> in the culture medium did not affect secretion of hsp90α or hsp90β .

consequently and taking into account the previously demonstrated interactions of both isoforms of hsp <dig> with mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  we explored the role of mab 4c <dig> in relation to these interactions, using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. to this purpose, concentrated conditioned media derived either from control or mab 4c <dig> treated cultures were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> followed by western blot analysis with antibodies against the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig>  as shown in figure 2c, co-immunoprecipitation of both isoforms of hsp <dig> with the inactive forms of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> was inhibited in the media derived from the cells cultured in the presence of mab 4c <dig>  when compared with control cultures. this result indicates that mab 4c <dig> disrupts extracellularly the interaction of both pro-mmp <dig> and pro-mmp <dig> with the two isoforms of hsp <dig> 

mab4c <dig> inhibits the metastatic deposition of mdamb <dig> breast cancer cells into the lungs of scid mice
on the basis of previously reported studies using the mdamb <dig> cell line  <cit>  and showing that mab 4c <dig> inhibits the invasion of these cells in vitro, we next sought to investigate the in vivo effect of mab 4c <dig> on the metastatic behavior of this breast cancer cell line. thus, we injected mdamb <dig> cells labeled with the fluorescent dye dii intravenously in scid mice, either in the presence or in the absence of  <dig> μg/ml of mab 4c <dig>  twenty four hours after the injection, mice were euthanized and the metastatic deposits of mdamb <dig> cells were traced and evaluated in the lungs of both the control and the mab 4c <dig> treated groups. at the macroscopic level an important number of metastatic cell deposits  was observed in control animals as compared to mab 4c <dig> treated mice. this was confirmed microscopically where a very important decrease in the deposition of cancer cells was detected in the mab 4c <dig> treated mice . quantification of the metastatic deposit formation revealed a  <dig> % inhibition in the mab 4c <dig> treated mice when compared with control mice . in order to further visualize the deposition of mdamb <dig> cells in the lung tissue, we performed a 3d reconstitution of a cryosection derived from a control animal where the infiltration of metastatic deposits of mdamb <dig> cells in the lung tissue is clearly demonstrated . it is of interest to note that in the mab 4c <dig> treated mice, mdamb <dig> cells were often observed stagnating on the inner surface of large pulmonary blood vessels whereas no such images could be detected in the control animals . quantification of this occurrence revealed that in  <dig> % of the pulmonary vessels visualized in the, mab4c <dig> treated animals, mdamb <dig> cells were observed stagnating on the inner surface of the vessels. in contrast, only  <dig> % of the vessels observed in the control animals showed intravascular retention of the cancer cells. .

discussion
our present findings demonstrate that both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig> are secreted by cultured mdamb <dig> human breast cancer cells and interact with matrix metalloproteinases, mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  additionally, we show that a monoclonal antibody against hsp <dig>  mab 4c <dig>  prevents maturation of the two metalloproteinases in vitro and inhibits metastatic deposition of breast cancer cells in vivo.

we have previously reported the presence of hsp90α and hsp90β on the cell surface of mdamb <dig> breast cancer cells  <cit> . here we further examined the extracellular localization of hsp <dig>  more specifically, we demonstrated the secretion of both hsp90α and hsp90β in the culture medium of mdamb <dig> cells using antibodies specific for the two isoforms. at this point it is important to note that specificity of the anti-hsp90β antibody was further confirmed since, western blot analysis of human recombinant hsp90α using this antibody gave negative results . our findings, for the first time to our knowledge, reveal secretion of hsp90β by breast cancer cells and are only partly in agreement with existing knowledge. indeed, previous studies have reported secretion only of hsp90α from various cell types including ht  <dig> fibrosarcoma cells  <cit> , human dermal fibroblasts under hypoxia conditions <cit>  and transforming growth factor alpha stimulated human keratinocytes  <cit> 

controlled degradation of the extracellular matrix is essential for the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. in this context matrix metalloproteinases and in particular mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are of crucial significance for tumor development and progression  <cit> . indeed increasing experimental evidence indicates involvement of both enzymes at multiple steps of the metastatic process <cit>  it is important to note that these metalloproteinases are secreted as inactive pro- enzymes and acquire their active form extracellularly  <cit> . taking these into account together with accumulating data demonstrating extracellular activity of hsp <dig>  <cit> , we next examined the possible interaction of this molecule with the two metalloproteinases using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. our results showed that both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig> interact with the secreted, inactive forms of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  interestingly, reverse co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that hsp <dig> also interacts, with the extracellularly activated forms of the two mmps, the above observations indicate that hsp <dig> participates in the activation of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  moreover, they suggest a second level of chaperoning for this molecule associated with the mature forms of the metalloproteinases examined. our findings are in accordance with previously reported data showing association of the secreted pool of hsp90α with mmp <dig>  <cit> . moreover they provide new evidence for a further increase in the number of clients of this chaperone molecule by adding mmp <dig> to the list of its extracellular substrates.

we have previously demonstrated that mab 4c <dig> inhibits the invasive capacity of mdamb <dig> breast cancer cells by disrupting the interaction of cell surface hsp <dig> with the extracellular domain of her- <dig>  a member of the erbb family of epidermal growth factor receptors  <cit> . taking this into account together with the above mentioned findings we next investigated whether mab 4c <dig> independently of its effect on her <dig> has also an effect on the secretion and activation of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  our results showed that when the cell- impermeable mab 4c <dig>  <cit>  is added to the culture medium of mdamb <dig> cells, secretion of pro-mmp <dig> and pro-mmp <dig> is not affected; however and as shown by zymography and western blot analysis, the activation of these metalloproteinases is dramatically inhibited as compared to controls where mab 4c <dig> is not included in the culture medium. moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed as described in methods, revealed that mab 4c <dig> effectively disrupts the interaction of hsp <dig> with mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> respectively. our present data indicate that mab 4c <dig> while not affecting secretion of the inactive forms of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  prevents their maturation most probably by disrupting their interaction with the extracellular pool of hsp <dig>  similar to our results have been previously reported by eustace et al  <cit>  who have shown that inhibition of extracellular hsp90α decreases activation of mmp <dig>  at this point it should be noted that preliminary experiments performed using the mdamb <dig> breast cancer cells which lack the her <dig> receptor, indicate not only that these cells too secrete both isoforms of hsp <dig> but also that mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> activation by extracellular hsp <dig> may be independent of the her2/hsp <dig> interaction previously reported  <cit> , since in this system as well mab 4c <dig> prevented activation of these metalloproteinases . nevertheless our overall observations do not exclude the possibility that in combination with hsp <dig> additional molecules, such as other hsps, hsp <dig> co-chaperones etc may be necessary for the activation of the mmps studied in this work. this however, needs further investigation.

we have previously demonstrated that mab 4c <dig> significantly inhibits melanoma metastasis in c57bl/ <dig> mice inoculated with b <dig> f <dig> melanoma cells,  <cit> . supporting accumulating data showing that antibodies or other small molecules that inhibit hsp <dig> can be used as anti-cancer agents  <cit>  this prompted us to explore the anti-metastatic activity of mab 4c <dig> with respect to mdamb <dig> breast cancer cells. in line with the recently reported in vitro results  <cit> , in this work we showed that mab 4c <dig> strongly inhibits the metastatic depositions of mdamb <dig> cells into the lungs of scid mice. more specifically an  <dig> % inhibition of metastatic depositions of mdamb <dig> cells was observed in the mab 4c <dig> treated mice as compared with control animals. it is interesting to note that in the experimental group of mice that received mab 4c <dig>  mdamb <dig> cells were often observed stagnating on the inner surface of large pulmonary vessels, whereas such a phenomenon was very rarely detected in the control mice. quantification of this occurrence confirmed a statistically significant difference  between the two experimental groups. this remarkable observation together with the above mentioned data, tempts us to reason that mab 4c <dig> exerts its activity by disrupting the interaction of extracellular hsp <dig> with mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> and thus preventing activation of these matrix metalloproteinases which, as is well documented  <cit> , is necessary for the degradation of type iv collagen, a major constituent of the basement membrane associated with the pulmonary blood vessel. as a consequence, tumor cells remain limited to the inner surface of the vessel and their infiltration into the lung tissue is impaired. regulation of mmp activation has been previously correlated with cancer cell extravasation. in particular cruz-munoz et al have reported that timp- <dig> decreases mmp <dig> activation which in turn limits tumor cell extravasation and subsequent colonization of the lung <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our present findings combined with recently reported data  <cit> , reinforce and further extend the idea that extracellular chaperoning of both the α and the β isoforms of hsp <dig>  at least in relation to cancer cell invasion and metastasis, is exerted at multiple levels such as activation of growth factor receptor as previously reported <cit>  and mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> activation. our results additionally suggest that extracellular hsp <dig> may also chaperone the activity of the mature metalloproteinases with their corresponding substrates. however, elucidation of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions needs further investigation. finally, our present work further demonstrates the anti-metastatic capacity of mab 4c <dig>  showing that it inhibits not only melanoma metastasis  <cit>  but also the formation of metastatic breast cancer cell deposits by preventing extravasation of tumor cells and their invasion in the lung tissue.
