BACKGROUND
vocal-acoustic communication is a prominent feature of vertebrate social behavior. despite having evolved diverse peripheral sonic organs, brainstem vocal networks that control vocalization are remarkably conserved across vertebrate taxa  <cit> . in tetrapods and several clades of fishes, sound production relies upon temporally stable modulations of acoustic waveforms over millisecond timescales  <cit> . although vocal networks in several vertebrate lineages achieve high degrees of synchrony and precision , it is unknown whether these properties depend on a suite of conserved genetic/molecular mechanisms.

recent microarray and genome analyses in a songbird, the zebra finch , have advanced our understanding of the relationship between genes and vocal behavior by identifying transcription factors and gene networks activated in forebrain song nuclei  <cit> , including during singing  <cit> . similar large-scale gene expression studies in other species that aim to link gene expression to behavior typically use whole brains or regions containing multiple neuron types . while these studies provide significant insight into the genetic regulation of behavioral states, cellular and network level interpretations of results are confounded by the complexity of the underlying neural structure or behavior.

for the vast majority of vocal vertebrates that currently lack either genomic data or species-specific microarrays, no large-scale expression study has examined genes whose products directly support the function of a single neuronal population devoted to sound production. here, we identify candidate molecular mechanisms contributing to the neural coding of vocal behavior in the plainfin midshipman fish , an established model for the neural basis of acoustic communication. in order to link gene expression to neurophysiological events that directly translate to behavior, we focused rna sequencing  transcriptome analyses on a single hindbrain nucleus that is dedicated to the temporal patterning of a simple vocal behavior.

midshipman belong to an order of highly vocal teleost fish known as toadfishes   <cit>  that produce different call types depending on social context  <cit> . nest-guarding males, which are used in this study, produce several call types, including a long duration advertisement “hum”. the hum is a stable, high frequency  call that is energetically demanding and essential for mate attraction  <cit> . hums are produced continuously for minutes to hours, including in captivity , throughout the night during the summer breeding season  <cit> .figure  <dig> midshipman is a neuroethological model for studying neural control of vocalization. a) midshipman vocal behavior varies across a range of time scales. picture of a midshipman fish  with schematic side view of the brain, vocal nerve , and sonic swimbladder , the sound-producing organ with vocal muscles  attached to the sidewalls. continuous hums can last from mins to >1 h, as shown in the  <dig>  h hum recorded from a captive male , and are produced repetitively throughout the night during the summer breeding season . close-up of natural hum is adapted from  <cit> . b) schematic saggital view of the midshipman brain showing the hindbrain vocal pattern generator that consists of the vocal pre-pacemaker nucleus , vocal pacemaker nucleus , and vocal motor nucleus  . forebrain and midbrain vocal centers drive the hindbrain pattern generator, which provides a precise and synchronous code that controls sonic muscle contraction in a one-to-one manner  and vn recording . trace of a long duration vn recording  adapted from  <cit> . c) tissue groups used for transcriptome analysis and their notations. left: a transverse section at the level of vmn showing bilateral, transneuronal biocytin labeling in vmn and the vocal tract  ; each vmn innervates the ipsilateral vocal sb muscle. in this study, we surgically separated the midline pair of vmn from the surrounding hindbrain tissue . right: abbreviations of sample groups according to the tissue and time of collection, used throughout this paper.



in midshipman, well-delineated forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain nuclei comprise a vocal network  <cit>  . the collective output of this network determines the natural vocalization’s fine  and gross  temporal structure  <cit> . this motor command is relayed to a single pair of dedicated vocal muscles by way of the hindbrain vocal motor nucleus , which forms a hindbrain vocal central pattern generator  with separate premotor pacemaker and prepacemaker nuclei   <cit> . although forebrain and midbrain vocal nuclei gate and modulate hindbrain vocal cpg output and are highly sensitive to hormone action  <cit> , the surgically isolated hindbrain vocal cpg region is both necessary and sufficient for generating the vocal command signal, and remains sensitive to hormonal modulation  <cit> .

vmn’s intrinsic and network neuronal properties drive synchronous and stable population-level firing that faithfully amplifies premotor temporal input  <cit> . each vmn spike leads to a single sound pulse, resulting in a one-to-one translation between vmn output and the temporal properties of natural vocalization, such as call duration and fundamental frequency . terrestrial vertebrates such as songbirds, bats, and primates rely on vocal networks that integrate input from breathing circuits  <cit>  to drive multiple vocal and respiratory muscles. in contrast, the simpler vocal systems of fishes do not rely on airflow and engage a single pair of sonic muscles, providing a straightforward link between gene expression, neural networks, and behavior  <cit> .

in addition to the direct translation between neurophysiological activity and behavior, the midshipman vmn provides several advantages for revealing molecular mechanisms underlying vocal patterning. first, the paired midline vmn together  form a highly interconnected, homogenous population of ~ <dig> vocal motoneurons  <cit> , inclusive of surrounding glial cells and presynaptic inputs that support vmn network function, which can be excised in-toto for focal molecular analysis of a single brain nucleus  <cit> . second, a set of intrinsic  and network  neuronal properties of the vmn are well characterized  <cit> . these properties guide the identification of candidate genes encoding specific molecular counterparts that likely contribute to vmn’s extreme population-level synchrony on a millisecond timescale . third, midshipman vocal behavior follows predictable daily and seasonal cycles  <cit> . this allows us to utilize temporal variation to identify genes driving changes in vocal network excitability at different daily and seasonal time points  <cit>  . fourth, a large body of work that documents hormonal modulation of the vocal system at multiple levels of analyses  informs the functional significance of gene expression patterns .

we aimed to identify molecular pathways specific to vmn function by comparing patterns of gene expression in the vmn to the surrounding hindbrain  across daily and seasonal time points of high and low sound production . as outlined in figure  <dig>  we focused first on between-tissue differences in gene expression to identify candidate gene pathways important for vmn function, then on within-tissue comparisons to identify candidate gene pathways with biologically relevant expression patterns across the day and season.figure  <dig> schematic of analytic approaches with associated figure and table numbers. we took a two-pronged approach in analyzing the vast array of data generated from rna-seq. first, for vmn vs. h comparisons, we used a cyclic loess method, fastlo, to eliminate a non-linear tissue-dependent skew between datasets . we then treated time point samples as replicates for each tissue for differential expression with edger. second, we followed the trinity-supported downstream analyses of clustering differentially expressed transcripts and focused these analyses on clusters with biologically relevant expression patterns across the day and season . additionally, we analyzed expression and correlation patterns of transcripts belonging to six broad gene functional categories. *genes were grouped in broad categories regardless of whether they were differentially expressed.



by harnessing the extensive knowledge of the midshipman vocal network, the vmn transcriptome elucidated a set of molecular pathways underlying neuronal excitability in a motor nucleus that instructs vocal patterning across multiple timescales, from milliseconds to hours and seasons. our results directly inform future studies using molecular, anatomical, and neurophysiological methods to validate the function and cellular localization of candidate genes in the vmn. we propose that the candidate genes and molecular pathways identified here may belong to a shared genetic toolkit for vocal motoneurons in many species that face similar energetic and neurophysiological demands. thus, our results will inform future comparative studies to achieve a broader understanding of the molecular machinery required for vocalization.

RESULTS
in order to globally characterize molecular pathways governing vocal motor patterning, we compared the transcriptome of surgically isolated vmn to h tissue at three time points corresponding to high  and low  vocal activity . in order to minimize activity-induced gene-expression, we used males who had not been humming prior to sacrifice. see methods, and figures  <dig> and  <dig> for explanations of sample groups and analysis pipelines.

sequencing using the illumina hiseq <dig> system yielded approximately  <dig> million 100 bp reads across all brain groups used here and ear sample groups used for a companion study  <cit> . over 90% of the raw reads survived quality filtering and trimming, resulting in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million  paired-end reads per brain sample. our initial assembly produced  <dig>  contigs, with a mean length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp. after discarding contigs with open reading frames  of less than  <dig> amino acids and lowly supported transcripts  with less than 1% mapped reads for the gene , the final transcriptome contained  <dig>  assembled transcripts, with a mean length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp , representing  <dig>  gene components across brain and ear sample groups. the transcript length distribution and number of transcripts per gene are shown in figure 3a and b. the mean gc content for this filtered transcriptome was  <dig> %. of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>   contained complete orfs, comparable to a recent zebra finch transcriptome  <cit> . additionally, cegma  analysis of conserved eukaryotic genes , determined that our filtered transcriptome contained  <dig> full-length cegs of the complete set of  <dig> cegs , and  <dig> of the more-conserved set of  <dig> cegs   <cit> . blast2go annotation resulted in  <dig>   of our assembled transcripts with significant annotation hits, comparable to or above reported rates . seventeen of the top  <dig> blast hit species were teleost fish, with the top nine all being teleosts . there were  <dig>  transcripts, representing  <dig>  gene components, expressed in brain samples .figure  <dig> transcriptome assembly quality assessment. a) transcript length distribution. b) number of transcripts per gene component as determined by trinity. c) top species hits from blast against ncbi’s nr database, first nine species are teleost fish sequences out of a total of  <dig> teleost species within the list, indicated by *. d) quantitative pcr  was used to verify transcriptome-derived fpkm values of  <dig> genes in snh and smh tissue groups. pearson’s correlation analysis showed that qpcr and transcriptome measured ratios of snh/smh are significantly correlated with each other.



using qpcr, we validated the relative abundances of  <dig> transcripts from two of the same, pooled h samples that were submitted for illumina sequencing: reproductive summer morning  and reproductive summer night . our results showed a tight and highly significant correlation between the log-normalized snh/smh ratios by qpcr and fpkm  . additionally, expression levels of nine candidate genes also showed significant correlation between rna-seq and qpcr values . together, these results validated our transcriptome-predicted abundances and demonstrated the high quality of our de novo assembled transcriptome.

vmn versus h tissue comparisons
overview
in order to identify molecular pathways and candidate genes important for vmn function, we first focused on between-tissue comparisons. the cyclic loess “fastlo” normalization method  <cit> , as opposed to trimmed mean of m values  normalization  <cit> , successfully removed the nonlinear tissue-dependent skew , while preserving biologically relevant sample group similarities as seen in the clustering of samples by tissue and season in the multidimensional scaling plot . by conservatively treating the three sample groups collected at different times as biological replicates from which to estimate transcript-wise dispersion values in edger’s differential expression analysis  <cit> , we identified  <dig>  transcripts significantly upregulated in h and  <dig>  transcripts upregulated in vmn, which were the focus of downstream analyses.figure  <dig> evaluating tmm and fastlo normalization of tissue comparisons. a) plots of log <dig> ratios  versus mean expression across all sample groups . n =  <dig>  genes. alignment along  <dig> horizontal is expected. fitted loess lines are shown in blue. b) histograms of vmn/h mean ratios. even with peak at  <dig> indicates good normalization. c) box plots of each sample group. medians are expected to align along  <dig> with even distribution about the median across sample groups. rle: relative log ratio. d) multidimensional scaling plots showing similarities between vmn  and h  sample groups. samples show biologically relevant grouping by tissue and by season. bcv: biological coefficient of variation.

we performed fisher’s exact test on go terms to identify gene functions that are enriched in vmn or h. by comparing the subset of genes upregulated in vmn to the entire transcriptome, we found  <dig> over-represented go terms . the enrichment results overwhelmingly highlighted the importance of atp production in vmn, with 29% of the enriched go terms relating to aerobic metabolism . this high metabolic activity in the vmn is exemplified by the  <dig> most significantly enriched go terms . although few vmn enriched go terms were related to neural transmission functions, the go terms “neurotransmitter biosynthetic process” and “choline o-acetyltransferase activity” were enriched, consistent with vmn motoneurons being cholinergic  <cit>  . furthermore, we found several enriched go terms related to steroid hormone signaling, including “gonadotropin secretion”, “endocrine hormone secretion”, and “sterol biosynthetic process”, indicating that the vmn is hormonally active . finally, go terms related to post-transcriptional processes were also enriched for vmn, including “translation” , “ribosome” , “gene expression” , and “rna processing” , indicating that vmn is translationally active.

in contrast, 75% of the  <dig> go terms enriched in transcripts upregulated in h were related to synaptic function and neurotransmission . the top  <dig> biological process go terms were all related to cell signaling and synaptic transmission, the top  <dig> molecular function terms were related to membrane transporter activity, and the top  <dig> cellular component go terms were related to the synapse or membrane . the observation that h contains a higher diversity of neurotransmission genes is consistent with h containing diverse motor and non-motor nuclei as well as abundant white matter  compared to the high homogeneity of motoneurons in vmn. in contrast to vmn, we found no enriched terms related to steroid hormones in h, although “neuropeptide signaling pathway” was enriched .

top  <dig> kegg  pathways with the highest number of mapped transcripts that were upregulated in vmn or h. additionally, we show that more transcripts upregulated in vmn are mapped to glutathione methabolism, steroid and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways.

in order to compare the relative representation of biochemical signaling pathways in vmn vs. h, we mapped differentially expressed transcripts to kegg pathways  <cit>  . transcripts upregulated in vmn mapped predominantly to pathways directly related to atp production, including “oxidative phosphorylation”, “pyruvate metabolism”, “citrate cycle ”, and “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis”, which is consistent with go term enrichment results that also indicated high levels of metabolic activity in vmn. pathways unique to transcripts upregulated in vmn also included those involved in antioxidant defense against oxidative stress, such as “glutathione metabolism”  <cit> , indicating that vmn is capable of combating reactive oxygen species generated by aerobic metabolism. additionally, we found steroid hormone related pathways  that support go term enrichment results highlighting vmn as a hormonally active nucleus. transcripts in the “carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes” found in vmn were confirmed by blast to have high identity to transcripts of other fish and likely represent metabolic genes conserved from bacteria through vertebrates. in contrast, transcripts upregulated in h mapped predominantly to phospholipid metabolism and signaling pathways . phospholipids are important components of cell membranes and precursors to important secondary messengers such as diacyl glycerol and inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate  <cit> .

together, kegg pathway and go term enrichment results showed that vmn is metabolically, hormonally, and post-transcriptionally active. in contrast, transcription in the surrounding hindbrain is devoted to synaptic transmission and membrane processes. it has been estimated that acoustic courtship in ectotherms requires an eight-fold increase from resting metabolic rate  <cit> . results highlighting the importance of cellular respiration in vmn are consistent with its ability to sustain high frequency firing that drives advertisement hums up to hours  repetitively throughout a single night of courtship-related activity  <cit> . while studies have extensively characterized the high aerobic demands of “superfast” muscles in midshipman and closely related toadfish, among the fastest contracting skeletal muscles in vertebrates  <cit> , our results indicate a concomitantly high metabolic demand in the motoneurons that drive these muscles.

gene category analyses
guided by the above results and previous studies of vmn characteristics, we wanted to compare expression levels of transcripts belonging to different functional categories with significant implications for cellular and network level excitability. thus, regardless of differential expression, we selectively analyzed transcripts belonging to the following functional categories: neurotransmission , neuroendocrine , neuropeptides, neuromodulators, cellular respiration, and antioxidants . transcripts for each category are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

while the overall pool of expressed transcripts was smaller in vmn than in h  , transcript abundances were comparable between tissues in most gene categories . two exceptions were cellular respiration, which had significantly higher expression in vmn , and neurotransmission, which had significantly higher expression in h  , substantiating our interpretations of go term enrichment results as discussed above .

pairwise spearman correlation analyses revealed that overall, cellular respiration had the highest correlation between sample groups . because the spearman coefficient is derived from calculating the pearson correlation of transcript abundance ranks between two samples, these results demonstrate that although cellular respiration expression levels were higher in vmn , the relative abundances of transcripts to one another is conserved across sample groups . in contrast, the other functional categories, especially neuromodulators, showed lower correlation between vmn and h .

supporting the hypothesis that vmn expresses a unique molecular toolkit dedicated to vocal motor coding, the majority of functionally important transcripts upregulated in vmn  were unique from those upregulated in h . among the transcripts significantly upregulated in vmn relative to h , we identified those with neurotransmission functions, including ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels as well as metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors . we also identified transcripts with neuroendocrine functions, including steroid signaling and biosynthesis, neuropeptides and peptide hormones, and other neuromodulators . neurotransmission and neuroendocrine functions were the focus because of relevance to neural excitability and previous midshipman studies focusing on these mechanisms.

candidate neurotransmission genes
vmn’s synchronous and temporally precise activity is dependent on both synaptic interactions of the network as well as intrinsic properties of individual motoneurons  <cit> . there were  <dig> transcripts with  <dig> unique neurotransmission gene annotations upregulated in the vmn . these candidate genes included those supporting two of vmn’s major network components: electrical synapses formed by gap junctions and gabaergic inhibition  <cit> , both of which are also prominent mechanisms promoting network-level synchrony in other systems  <cit> . the presence of elevated gap junction subunit expression in vmn  affirmed previous evidence of electrotonic coupling in vmn, demonstrated by electron microscopy  <cit> , transneuronal dye diffusion  <cit> , and intracellular neurophysiology  <cit> . the multiple gaba receptor subunits upregulated in vmn  likely provide the prominent network-dependent afterhyperpolarization observed in vmn motoneurons, supported by the pharmacological blocking of gabaa receptors that severely reduced the duration and amplitude of vmn output  <cit> .

vmn’s intrinsic neuronal properties are likely mediated by several voltage-gated potassium channel  subunits that have known functions in controlling neuronal excitability . first, vmn showed increased expression of potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily c member 3-like  subunits , which contributes significantly to action potential repolarization and recovery of sodium channels from inactivation , permitting high-frequency repetitive firing that is a key feature of vmn motoneurons  <cit> . second, it has been shown that while nonfunctional alone, kcns1/kv <dig>  subunits decrease kcnb1/kv <dig>  currents when coassembled in heteromeric channels, which was modeled to increase the firing fidelity of a simulated neuron to a 100 hz stimulus  <cit> . the potential interaction of our candidate potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily s member 1-like  and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily b member  <dig>  subunits  may therefore regulate vmn firing frequency that directly determines the pulse repetition rate and fundamental frequency of natural vocalizations . kcns1/kv <dig>  subunits also decrease the conductance of kcnc/kv <dig> subunits, mentioned above, when they form heteromeric channels  <cit> . third, channels composed of potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily kqt member 2-like  subunits, also elevated in vmn , dampen neural excitability by being partially activated at resting membrane potentials  <cit> . we propose kcnq2/kv <dig>  underlies the low baseline excitability of vmn neurons, which contributes to their ability to fire with high fidelity to presynaptic input  <cit>  from the vocal pacemaker nucleus that sets call frequency  <cit> . in the fully aquatic frog xenopus laevis, male laryngeal motoneurons that drive vocalizations also have a strong low-threshold potassium current  <cit> , leading to the hypothesis that low intrinsic excitability conferred by high kcnq2/kv <dig>  expression may be a shared feature of vertebrate vocal motoneurons.

although we identified transcripts of candidate neurotransmission genes predicted a priori to be important for vmn function, we also found candidates previously not well studied in this system. one example is evidence of cholinergic input to vmn, supported by choline acetyltransferase staining of somata in the vocal premotor pacemaker region of midshipman , that has potentially significant contributions to vmn function. the alpha and beta subunits of neuronal nicotinic receptors found in our candidate list  could mediate fast, postsynaptic action of acetylcholine  <cit> , or modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, including gaba  <cit> , shown to play a prominent role in regulating vmn output . furthermore, evidence from other motor systems indicates cholinergic control of motoneuron excitability and firing frequency  <cit> , including actions mediated via postsynaptic muscarinic receptors and kcnb1/kv <dig>  potassium channels  <cit> , transcripts of which were elevated in vmn: muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m <dig>  and kcnb2/kv <dig>  . another target of muscarinic modulation is the kcnq/kv <dig> family of voltage gated potassium channels that decrease baseline neural excitability, of which kcnq2/kv <dig>  is found among our candidates   <cit> .

importantly, many of the candidate ion channels we note above are ideal targets for pharmacological validation using selective blockers . it is also worth highlighting that both kcns1/kv <dig>  and kcnq2/kv <dig>  mrna levels were elevated in four major telencephalic song control nuclei in the zebra finch  <cit> , with kcns1/kv <dig>  showing additional label in the tracheosyringeal division of the hypoglossal motor nucleus  , the brainstem region representing vmn’s analogue, if not homologue .

candidate neuroendocrine and neuromodulator genes
both behavioral and neurophysiological studies have shown that steroids exert rapid and robust effects on vocal behavior and the output of the vocal cpg via classical steroid receptors in midshipman and a closely related toadfish species . consistent with these studies, steroid receptors androgen receptor alpha  and estrogen receptor beta  <dig>  were both upregulated in the vmn . the estradiol synthetic enzyme ovarian aromatase  was upregulated in the vmn , consistent with previous studies showing dense aromatase protein and mrna expression in a dorsal layer of glial cells that surrounds and projects throughout the vmn  <cit> . the steroidogenic enzyme 3-keto-steroid reductase-like , responsible for the interconversion between estrone and estradiol  <cit> , was also elevated in the vmn . additionally, we found higher vmn expression of hydroxysteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase 1-like , a crucial enzyme that converts 11-beta-hydroxytestosterone to 11-ketotestosterone, and cortisol to the inactive metabolite cortisone  <cit>  . 11-ketotestosterone and cortisol are the major circulating androgen and glucocorticoid, respectively, in type i male midshipman that are the source of tissues used here , and cause a rapid increase in vocal cpg output duration within five minutes of systemic injection  <cit> . thus, many of the candidate neuroendocrine transcripts upregulated in vmn have direct relevance to vmn function as corroborated by prior studies.

additionally, we found previously under-studied neuroendocrine or neuromodulatory signaling pathways in vmn, including growth hormone, thyroid hormone, prostaglandin and dopamine, the latter of which is consistent with dense catecholaminergic input to vmn  <cit>  . one intriguing example is prostaglandin f2-alpha receptor-like, because prostaglandin f2-alpha is a potent sex pheromone that induces spawning behavior in fish  <cit> , though little is known about its effects on vocal behavior.

together, the steroid signaling candidate genes indicate that vmn exhibits high androgen and estrogen sensitivity by expressing steroid receptors and steroidogenic enzymes, consistent with prior studies showing their anatomical localization to vmn and influence on vocal cpg output . vmn function is also likely modulated by candidate gene products belonging to novel neuroendocrine and neuromodulatory pathways identified here.

candidate antioxidant genes
based on the enrichment of cellular respiration genes being upregulated in vmn, expected to generate harmful reactive oxygen species  <cit> , we hypothesized that the vmn combats oxidative stress by expressing high levels of antioxidant enzymes and proteins. supporting this hypothesis, we found the increased expression of several antioxidant genes in the vmn compared to h . notably, these included the well-studied cu/zn superoxide dismutase  enzyme , which catalyzes the conversion of two superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the importance of sod <dig> in motoneuronal function is demonstrated by human sod <dig> mutations that lead to the motoneuron degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   <cit> . the suite of antioxidants upregulated in vmn also included enzymes that produce or utilize glutathione for reducing reactive oxygen species, such as glutathione s-transferase , which synthesizes glutathione  <cit> , and glutathione peroxidase 4b , which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  . these results support our hypothesis that the vmn must combat oxidative stress incurred by high rates of cellular respiration resulting from prolonged activity  <cit> . because the fish used in this study were not actively engaged in vocal activity at the time of sacrifice , these results highlight a constitutive feature of the vmn. based on the implication of antioxidant enzymes and proteins in motoneuron and neural degenerative diseases  <cit> , we believe the vmn is a motor nucleus capable of withstanding extreme oxidative stress and therefore a useful model for studying the relationship between antioxidants and neural function.

candidate gene qpcr validation
we chose nine candidate genes upregulated in vmn to validate expression levels with qpcr . we used the same, pooled smv and smh rna for generating our rna-seq libraries to validate our findings of upregulated transcripts in the vmn. there was a high correlation of expression levels of all nine candidate genes measured by the two methods  . similarly, smv/smh fold changes calculated from qpcr correlated significantly with rna-seq derived fold changes  . finally, in concordance with rna-seq results, qpcr expression levels of candidate genes were significantly higher in smv when compared to smh  . the only gene not showing the expected pattern, cx <dig>  had  <dig> assembled isoforms and had the lowest expression among the tested candidates . altogether, qpcr results largely supported rna-seq results.

seasonal and daily variation in the vmn
overview
we aimed to identify functionally important candidate genes whose expression levels change on a daily or seasonal basis. hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed transcripts revealed that sample groups were most divergent across tissues  and reproductive state  , consistent with the above results . furthermore, the spearman correlation matrix showed higher within-tissue differences in the vmn than in the h . significantly differentially expressed transcripts were separated into 109 k-means clusters, from which we identified clusters showing seasonal and daily expression patterns  with upregulated expression in: all summer reproductive samples , summer vmn samples , or snv .figure  <dig> k-means clusters showing seasonal and daily patterns of gene expression. a) representative k-means clusters showing upregulation in all summer sample groups, vmn summer groups, and peak expression in summer night vmn . total transcript numbers for each k-means cluster expression pattern are shown next to the cluster type names used in the text. b) fpkm expression levels are plotted for our candidate ion channels exhibiting peak expression in snv. chrnb2: neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-2; gabrp: gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi; cx30: connexin 30/gap junction beta-6; kcnma <dig> : calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha- <dig>

functionally important candidate genes found in all-summer, vmn-summer, and peak-snv clusters. different transcripts with the same sequence description found in both vmn and h clusters are not listed. additionally, duplicate descriptions from multiple isoforms within each cluster type were reported only once. genes mentioned in the text or shown in figures have gene symbols in parentheses.

we found evidence for daily and seasonal regulation of candidate genes for specific ion channel subtypes as well as steroidogenic enzymes and receptors belonging to major hormone signaling pathways previously implicated in regulating seasonal and daily cycles of vocal motor excitability and behavior in midshipman.

seasonal comparisons
we first focused on finding candidate genes in all-summer and vmn-summer clusters  that would contribute to known vmn neurophysiological properties . neurotransmission related transcripts in all-summer clusters included the gap junction alpha  <dig>  that was unique to all-summer when compared to all-winter clusters . among the ion channel subunit genes upregulated in vmn-summer clusters were cx <dig>  excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors, inhibitory glycine receptors, voltage-gated potassium channel subunits, and a transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member  <dig>  . interestingly, trpm <dig>  which encodes a protein with both channel and kinase functions and is involved in regulating intracellular ca2+ and mg2+ levels, has been implicated in guamanian als and parkinson’s dementia  <cit> .figure  <dig> summary of proposed candidate genes as molecular basis of known vmn properties. a) known vmn neurophysiological properties. extreme temporal precision of motoneuron firing is shown by corresponding traces from an intracellular recording  and vn recording  . numbers 1– <dig> correspond to intrinsic neuronal and network vmn properties listed in c. b) schematic of known vmn neuroanatomical properties. most of the motoneuron somata appear gray with subsets of red and black somata to highlight properties that are representative of the entire vmn. glial expression of aromatase  <cit>  and androgen receptor beta  <cit>  is depicted in blue and orange. one of the black somata in the left vmn also depicts each motoneuron’s dendritic arbor that branches throughout each of the midline pair of motor nuclei and a single unbranched axon that exits via the ipsilateral vocal nerve  . the subsection of dense gabaergic innervation by cells lying outside of the vmn is also representative of the entire vmn. abbreviations: ar: androgen receptor; er: estrogen receptor; gaba: gamma-aminobutyric acid. c) for the suite of vmn properties, we identified corresponding transcripts that were significantly upregulated in the vmn compared to the surrounding hindbrain, and provide substantiating evidence from previous midshipman studies . abbreviations: ar-a: androgen receptor alpha; esr: estrogen receptor; cyp19a1a: aromatase; nrc3c1: glucocorticoid receptor; cx: connexin ; ap: action potential; kcn: voltage-gated potassium channels; ahp; afterhyperpolarization; gabra/gabaar: gabaa receptor; icc: immunocytochemistry; chrm2: muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m <dig>  *indicates kcn subunits known to regulate the function of subunits listed in the row above.



all-summer clusters also contained a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily c member 4-like  transcript . like the functional attributes of the kcnc3/kv <dig>  subunit discussed in the tissue comparisons section, potassium channels composed of kcnc4/kv <dig>  subunits could contribute to vmn’s ability to fire repetitively at high frequencies . as also mentioned earlier, kcnc4/kv <dig>  currents are modulated by kcns/kv <dig> subunits, transcripts of which are highly expressed in vmn , when coassembled in heteromeric channels  <cit> . strikingly, in motoneurons of an als mouse model carrying the human sod <dig> mutation, kcnc4/kv <dig>  was significantly downregulated relative to expression in wild type mice  <cit> , supporting its important role in motoneuronal function.

steroid signaling transcripts, such as ar-a , were found in all-summer clusters , indicating a summer-dependent increase in androgen sensitivity within both vmn and surrounding h. vmn’s androgen sensitivity is a shared trait with other vocal vertebrates. it has been well documented that songbird syringeal motoneurons within the nxiits concentrate high levels of androgens  <cit> . both midshipman vmn and songbird nxiits are sexually dimorphic in size, with males having larger motoneuronal somata and neuropil volume than females  <cit> . furthermore, the songbird nxiits responds to androgen treatment by increasing the size of motoneuronal somata, synaptic density, and the number of synaptic vesicles  <cit> , which could increase their ability to drive vocalizations during the breeding season. similarly, juvenile male midshipman treated with androgens exhibit increased size of vmn somata  <cit> . we also found a glucocorticoid receptor  in vmn-summer clusters, indicating a summer-dependent increase in glucocorticoid sensitivity specifically in the vmn . the presence of both androgen and glucocorticoid receptors is consistent with androgen- and cortisol-induced lengthening of hindbrain vocal cpg output  <cit> .

the neurotransmission and neuroendocrine mechanisms highlighted by our candidate genes could influence each other to bring about seasonal changes in vmn function and midshipman vocal behavior. for example, ultrastructure studies in songbirds and rodents have shown that estrogen and androgens can increase gap junction expression . testosterone treatment in female songbirds induced an increase in the number of soma-somatic gap junctions in hvc, a telencephalic song control nucleus, correlated with an increased repetition rate and decreased variability in frequency modulation of male-like song  <cit> . steroid-dependent seasonal regulation of gap junction abundance in vocal control nuclei influencing vocal behavior could also apply to midshipman fish.

we found nine neurotransmission transcripts within peak-snv clusters  that were all unique from those found in peak-snh clusters. these included an isoform of cx <dig>  gabaareceptor subunit pi-like , and two calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha- <dig>  isoforms . while cx <dig> and gabrp were both found in transcripts upregulated in the vmn compared to h , they are different trinity-predicted isoforms. similar to between-tissue comparisons that highlighted the importance of cholinergic action in vmn, we found acetylcholine receptors, including neuronal acetylcholine receptor beta-2-like  in peak-snv clusters . steroid signaling transcripts in peak-snv clusters included an estrogen receptor alpha  isoform , shown by in-situ to be expressed in vocal motoneurons  <cit> . we propose that seasonal and/or daily variation in the expression levels of neurotransmission and steroid hormone related transcripts support modulation of known vmn firing properties that, in turn, translates directly into changes in vocal behavior at times of high vocal activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the vocal motor system of midshipman fish exemplifies a simple vertebrate model with which we can identify genetic components supporting neural network function leading to a single behavior, in this case vocalization that serves a social communication function in multiple vertebrate lineages. this vmn transcriptome project provides a global view of molecular pathways responsible for neuronal function and hormone modulation in the vocal motoneurons of midshipman and vertebrate in general. we identified a suite of candidate genes whose functions underlie previously identified vmn firing properties, as well as novel candidates whose functions regulate aspects of neuronal excitability that remain to be studied in vmn .

the interpretive power of our results benefits directly from a large body of corroborating evidence in the midshipman model system, from synaptic ultrastructure to intracellular neurophysiology, anatomical localization of steroid signaling pathways, and hormonal modulation of vmn output and vocal behavior . the new results presented here guide future molecular, anatomical, and pharmacological investigations for determining how specific metabolic, hormonal, and neurotransmission pathways sculpt neurophysiological events that pattern vocal behavior.

our findings have broad relevance to other vertebrate taxa given the highly conserved nature of vocal mechanisms, shared demands for temporal precision in sound production, and the equally widespread occurrence of seasonal and daily variation in vocal behaviors . we propose that candidate genes and pathways identified here shape neurophysiological characters of motoneuronal populations driving the sound producing superfast muscles in toadfish  <cit> , birds  <cit> , bats  <cit> , and rattlesnakes  <cit> . the hypothesis that fish use the same fundamental molecular machinery as other vertebrates for controlling acoustic communication is challenging but testable. furthermore, contrasting our results to other motor systems will yield insight into the molecular machinery utilized by neuromuscular systems varying in speed, synchrony, and precision. finally, molecular insights into motoneuronal function will also be relevant for motoneuron dysfunction, such as diseases characterized by the loss of resilience to oxidative stress.
