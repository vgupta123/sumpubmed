BACKGROUND
biogenic amines  are molecules found in a wide range of fermented foods and can present a health hazard, including food poisoning, following consumption
 <cit> . the ba histamine and tyramine in particular cause hypertension and headaches
 <cit> . ba in foods are mainly produced through the decarboxylation of amino acids  by lactic acid bacteria 
 <cit> . from a physiological point of view, ba production could help lab to survive in acidic conditions by the production of metabolic energy
 <cit> . indeed the decarboxylation reaction from aa to ba, coupled to the transport, provides a proton motive force composed of a ph gradient  and a membrane electric potential . this mechanism was described in lactobacillus buchneri for histamine production by molenaar et al.
 <cit> , and more recently in lactobacillus brevis for tyramine conversion from tyrosine by wolken et al.
 <cit> . histamine
 <cit> , putrescine
 <cit> , tyramine
 <cit>  and cadaverine
 <cit>  are the main ba found in wine and are produced, during malolactic fermentation and storage, by lab of various genera, notably oenococcus, lactobacillus, leuconostoc and pediococcus. the main producers of tyramine are species from the lactobacillus genus
 <cit> . usually genes responsible for ba production are organized in clusters and are carried on genetic mobile elements integrated via horizontal gene transfer
 <cit> . this explained the variability observed between strains for ba accumulation. tyramine-producing bacteria carry a tyrdc cluster composed of four genes: tyrs encoding a tyrosil-trna synthetase, tyrdc encoding a decarboxylase, tyrp the tyrosine/tyramine transporter and nhac encoding an na+/h+ antiporter. this genetic organization has been described through lab including enterococcus faecalis <cit> , lactococcus lactis <cit>  and lactobacillus brevis <cit> .

several studies have investigated factors influencing ba production in wine. low ph
 <cit> , high ethanol concentration and low concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate
 <cit>  favor reductions of ba accumulation. the ba content of wine also varies between viticultural regions, grape varieties
 <cit>  and vintages
 <cit> . to avoid ba accumulation, commercially selected malolactic starters are added
 <cit>  based on rapd-pcr typing and selected for their technological performances to ensure mlf beginning and also wine quality
 <cit> . one of the major factors affecting ba production is the concentration of amino acids or, more broadly, nitrogen compounds
 <cit> . free amino acids  favor ba formation: the histidine and the tyrosine decarboxylases are both enzymes induced in lactobacillus sp. by histidine
 <cit>  and in lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus hilgardii by the addition of tyrosine
 <cit> . the aa and biogenic amine contents of wine have been analyzed by hplc to assess the relationships between the two classes of molecules
 <cit> . when ba reached the detection threshold, a correlation was made between high amounts of aa and increased ba accumulation. bach et al.
 <cit>  reported that the final concentration of ba increases if nitrogen compounds are added during alcoholic fermentation. also, storage on lees
 <cit>  increases ba production due to the availability of nitrogen compounds released from yeasts undergoing autolysis. yeast autolysis involves the breakdown of yeast cell membranes and the release of hydrolytic enzymes that then degrade components in the medium
 <cit> ; consequently, the medium is enriched in protein, peptides and free amino acids. alexandre et al.
 <cit>  shown that yeasts can release until  <dig> mg.l- <dig> of peptides during autolysis. furthermore wine peptides contain between  <dig> and  <dig> mg.l- <dig> of tyrosine
 <cit>  and contribute to the overall nitrogen compound
 <cit> . so peptides, as well as free aa, could also be involved in ba production.

moreover, lab performing malolactic fermentation  express a proteolytic system; they therefore can degrade peptides in the extracellular or intracellular media and then decarboxylate aa to produce ba. indeed, o. oeni exhibits a proteolytic activity against peptides in both white and red wines
 <cit> , and an extracellular protein, epra, with protease activity has been characterized
 <cit> . nevertheless, it seems that the proteolytic activity of o. oeni is dependent on both the composition of the medium and the bacterial growth phase
 <cit> . a proteinase named prtp produced by one isolate of lactobacillus plantarum has been identified
 <cit> . the aim of this study was to test the ability of l. plantarum to produce tyramine from synthetic peptides containing tyrosine, and to investigate whether peptides are hydrolyzed either inside the cell or in the extracellular medium.

different sorts of synthetic peptides, containing two to four amino acids, were used to conduct these experiments depending on either the size or the place of the tyrosine residue. it is well known that transporters and intracellular peptidases have preferences for peptide size . indeed, various types of peptide transport have been described in the model lab lactococcus lactis. it harbors a well-characterized opp transport system, of the abc transporter family, which can transport peptides containing  <dig> to  <dig> residues
 <cit> . the proteins dtpt and dppp are specialized in the transport of dipeptides
 <cit>  and tripeptides
 <cit> , respectively. l. plantarum has also an essential system for peptides uptake
 <cit> .

peptidases display specificities for the position of residues in peptides. many bacteria express specific intracellular peptidases able to hydrolyze peptide bonds. for example, the pepn aminopeptidase, has been described in a wide range of lab including lactobacillus helveticus <cit> , lactobacillus delbrueckii <cit>  and lactococcus lactis <cit> , and hydrolyze the residue located at the n-terminus of peptides. di- and tri-peptidases, such as pepv, isolated from lactococcus lactis <cit>  and several lactobacilli, are able to breakdown dipeptides containing a gly redisue at the n-terminus. in this study two of the peptides used  have a gly residue at the n-terminus. growth, tyramine production and expression of tyrdc and tyrp were also investigated in media with either free tyrosine or a mix of selected synthetic peptides.

RESULTS
lactobacillus plantarum is frequently isolated from red wine undergoing malolactic fermentation  and it usually contributes to production of tyramine
 <cit> . it is auxotrophic for tyrosine and thus is suitable for studying the production of tyramine from peptides containing tyrosine.

the tyrdc and tyrp genes of l. plantarum ir bl0076
based on 16s rna gene sequencing  and multiplex pcr using reca gene-derived primers
 <cit>  , a lactic acid bacterial strain isolated from wine and able to produce tyramine was identified as l. plantarum, and was named ir bl <dig>  to characterize the tdc pathway of this strain, we amplified and sequenced the region carrying tyrdc and tyrp; the complete sequences of the tyrdc and tyrp genes in lactobacillus plantarum have not previously been reported although tyrdc was partially sequenced by arena et al.
 <cit> . the presence of the tyrdc gene is strain-specific, and sequenced l. plantarum genomes, like those of strains wcfs <dig> and atcc  <dig>  do not carry the genes of the tyrdc pathway.

primers tyrsa and nhaca were used to amplify the tyrdc and tyrp genes from l. plantarum ir bl0076; a fragment of the expected size  was obtained and sequenced. the dna sequence  shares 98% identity with those of the l. brevis ns <dig> tyrdc and tyrp genes. the deduced amino acid sequence showed  <dig> to 100% identity with tyrdc and tyrp from l. brevis ns <dig>  ioeb  <dig> and atcc  <dig> strains . regarding this alignment, the tyrdc sequence from l. brevis ns <dig> showed six amino acids substitutions compared to the three other strains: a <dig>  n <dig>  p <dig>  s <dig>  a <dig> and v <dig> are changed in e <dig>  s <dig>  q <dig>  r <dig>  v <dig> and a <dig> respectively. moreover the amino acid a <dig> is also changed in v <dig> for l. brevis atcc  <dig>  lower identity was obtained with tyrdc from lactobacillus brevis subsp. gravesensis . identity with the sequences in other lactobacilli, such as sporolactobacillus sp. enterococcus hirae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans and enterococcus faecalis ranges between  <dig> and 80%. amino acid sequence similarity with the sequences from lactobacillus coleohominis 101-4-chn and lactobacillus oris strains is lower, between  <dig> and 60%, with better conservation for the tyrdc  than tyrp  amino acid sequences. a phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate the evolutionary relationships between these proteins. based on the sequence divergence in amino acid tyrdc sequences , the phylogenetic tree reveals that l. plantarum tyrdc is closely related to those of l. brevis proteins and made one cluster clearly separated. similar results were obtained when phylogenetic tree was constructed with tyrp amino acid sequences . these results confirm that the organization of this l. plantarum tdc locus is similar to those described for other lab strains, with contiguous tyrdc and tyrp genes. the phylogenetic tree analysis is consistent with the tdc locus of l. plantarum ir bl <dig> strain having been transferred horizontally from l. brevis.

growth of l. plantarum with peptides containing tyrosine
peptides of different sizes were used: a dipeptide tyr-ala containing the tyrosine residue at the n-terminus, a tripeptide gly-leu-tyr with the tyrosine at the c-terminus, and a peptide of four amino acids gly-gly-tyr-arg, where the tyrosine is in an internal position.

the growth was monitored by measuring the od at  <dig> nm. l. plantarum ir bl <dig> was able to grow in the synthetic medium either with free amino acids  or synthetic peptides containing tyrosine . the growth curve was the same in the two media , but not in mrs medium . indeed at  <dig> h of growth, the maximum od at  <dig> nm of  <dig>  was reached in mrs rich medium, while in the synthetic poor media, the od at  <dig> nm was  <dig> . l. plantarum is auxotrophic for l-tyrosine
 <cit> , and indeed l. plantarum ir bl <dig> could not grow in the synthetic medium used in this study without the inclusion of tyrosine. therefore, the synthetic peptides in medium  <dig> were presumably metabolized even during the early stages of culture to release tyrosine and to allow the growth. this is consistent with the demonstration that two lactobacillus strains  isolated from sausages, express tyrosine and ornithine decarboxylase activities allowing growth at early stages of culture
 <cit> ; both strains display extracellular proteolytic activity which reaches a maximum in the early exponential growth. this activity is higher when the cells were grown in a peptide-rich medium. however, peptide transport and a subsequent intracellular hydrolysis is also plausible. although lab proteinases have a broad specificity and release oligopeptides in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> aa, intracellular peptidases are required for the complete degradation of peptides
 <cit> .

tyramine production by lactobacillus plantarum ir bl0076
supernatant harvested from the cultures after various times of growth was analyzed by hplc to determine tyramine production . from gomez-alonso et al.
 <cit> , the detection limit for aminoenone derivative of tyramine is  <dig>  mg.l- <dig>  tyramine was identified by hplc-ms . at culture od600nm =  <dig> , no tyramine was detected in any culture. tyramine was detected, at similar concentrations, in cultures in both media from od600nm =  <dig> . concentrations of tyramine for both media were measured between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg.l- <dig> . the concentrations measured in both media are usually found in wine. indeed in red wines, tyramine concentration can reached  <dig> mg.l- <dig> which is the upper limit, but most of time these concentrations are lower than  <dig>  mg.l- <dig> <cit> . therefore, l. plantarum was able to synthesize tyramine similarly from free tyrosine and from peptides containing tyrosine.

tyramine was produced throughout growth and it accumulated as the biomass increased. this is consistent with the biological role of tyramine: it is involved in energy production through decarboxylation coupled to transport
 <cit> . this is the first demonstration that tyramine can be produced from peptides containing tyrosine and therefore that free tyrosine is not the only precursor for tyramine production. we studied the expression of the tyrdc and tyrp genes to determine whether it was growth phase-dependent and/or nitrogen source dependent.

tyrdc and tyrp expression
the tyrdc and tyrp genes are co-transcribed in e. faecalis <cit> , l. brevis <cit>  and sporolactobacillus sp.
 <cit> . a complete transcriptional analysis of the four genes of the operon was made in lactobacillus brevis ioeb 9809
 <cit> . even if tyrdctyrp transcripts were the most abundant, other polycistronic mrna were described as: tyrs-tyrdc-tyrp-nhac and tyrs-tyrdc, as well as tyrp-nhac. so tyrdc and tyrp can be transcribed from different manner. l. plantarum ir bl <dig> tdc locus sequences was analysed using arnold, an interface allowing localization of rho-independent terminators in any bacterial sequence. . a predicted transcription terminator  localized at the 3′ end of tyrp coding region was identified. erpin and rnamotif programm predict the 5′ end position of this predicted transcription terminator at the nucleotide  <dig> of the locus.

to check the presence of a bicistronic tyrdc-tyrp in the ir bl <dig> isolate, we used reverse-transcription-pcr experiments and primers tdcf and tyrplpr located inside the tyrdc and tyrp genes respectively to study their expression in l. plantarum. an amplicon of  <dig>  bp was obtained using cdna obtained from rna extracted from cultures on each medium  <dig> and medium  <dig> as the template. the length of the rt-pcr product indicates that tyrp is part of a polycistronic mrna including tyrdc. as the four genes of the tyrosine decarboxylase operon are part of a genetic island, as described for l. brevis <cit> , they have been disseminated through lactic acid bacteria via a horizontal gene transfer
 <cit> . so it is expected that they are regulated in the same way in all enterococci and lactobacilli including l. plantarum.

to study the tyrosine transport, expression tyrp and tyrdc was similarly analyzed by rt-qpcr. the expression of tyrp increased during growth in both medium  <dig> and medium  <dig>  with a maximum at od600nm =  <dig>  , and was significantly stronger during the stationary phase than during early exponential growth. the expression of tyrp paralleled the accumulation of tyramine in both media . this is coherent with what has been found for other bacteria producing biogenic amines, for example streptococcus thermophilus <cit> , which produces histamine at the end of its growth, with an increase in the expression of the decarboxylase hdca. the expression profile of tyrdc during growth was very similar to that of tyrp . both tyrdc and tyrp were significantly more strongly expressed during the early exponential growth phase in peptide medium  than tyrosine medium . also, the expression of tyrdc during the stationary growth phase was higher in peptide than tyrosine medium. this higher expression in peptide medium was not associated with a higher concentration of tyramine, and its physiological significance is not clear. this is the first study of the influence of peptides on tyrdc and tyrp expression in lab.

proteolysis of peptides
tyramine could be produced from peptides in two ways. peptides could be hydrolyzed in the extracellular medium by proteinase. alternatively, they could be transported inside the cell by a peptide transporter, then hydrolyzed by intracellular peptidases, and the released tyrosine decarboxylated to give tyramine which could be exported by the tyrp permease. however, this second possibility is unlikely, because the tyrp transporter catalyses the exchange of tyrosine and tyramine. we assayed tyrosine in the culture medium during the growth of l. plantarum to determine whether peptides were hydrolyzed extracellularly .

in the peptide medium  <dig>  the concentration of tyrosine was measured when the cultures reached the exponential growth phase. therefore synthetic peptides were, as expected, hydrolyzed in the extracellular medium. tyramine is presumably produced from the hydrolysis of peptides throughout the growth of the culture. the genome of the sequenced strain, l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  contains genes encoding uptake systems for peptides, and in particular the oligopeptide transport system opp. once internalized, peptides can be degraded by peptidases. l. plantarum wcfs <dig> has nineteen genes encoding intracellular peptidases with diverse specificities
 <cit> . note also that one isolate of l. plantarum produces an extracellular proteinase, prtp
 <cit> , and proteolytically active strains produce one or more other extracellular proteinase. our experiments do not exclude the possibility that peptides are also imported and hydrolyzed inside the cell. indeed, tyrosine generated by extracellular proteinase could be exchanged with tyramine that has been formed inside the cell after decarboxylation of tyrosine derived from intracellular hydrolysis of peptides. however, no such mechanism has ever been described in any lactic acid bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first demonstration that peptides containing amino acids precursors of biogenic amines  can be used by bacteria to produce such ba. we show that peptides are, in fact, broken down into amino-acids , which are the ba precursors in the extracellular medium. peptide transport has a high energy cost for the cell and requires the hydrolysis of atp
 <cit> . this degradation of peptides outside the cell is thus a simple and energetically favorable way to obtain free aa for metabolic needs.

this study is of technological interest, because most enological practices aim at enriching wine in nutrients to enhance the performance of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria, and to improve wine quality. this is why the influence of nitrogen sources on biogenic amines production has been extensively studied. indeed, the presence of fine yeasts lees increase ba production, because of the wide range of nitrogen-containing precursors released
 <cit> . because nitrogen, and especially yeast-assimilable nitrogen, is the limiting factor for yeast development, musts are sometimes supplemented with nitrogen sources
 <cit> . thus, nutritive supplements, for example yeast autolysates containing amino acids and proteins, are added to must to activate alcoholic fermentation. it has been shown that after malolactic fermentation, the concentration of biogenic amines is higher in wine produced with supplemented than unsupplemented must
 <cit> . therefore, as lab are able to produce biogenic amines both from amino acids and directly from peptides, enological practices favoring the development of alcoholic fermentation and malolactic fermentation have to be carefully monitored.
