BACKGROUND
diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids  of n- <dig> series show many beneficial health effects, both in animal models and humans. these include effects on cardiovascular and immune systems, on glucose homeostasis, as well as on the accumulation of body fat . however, recent epidemiological studies started a debate on the possible health benefits of n- <dig> pufa  <cit> . to resolve the potential health benefits of these fatty acids, knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is needed.

to elucidate molecular effects of n- <dig> pufa in vivo, gene expression analyses have been undertaken in animal models using a variety of dietary fatty acids in several tissues, including brain, liver, heart, and adipose  <cit> . the majority of those studies focused on liver and white adipose tissue , which is not surprising given the fact that these are considered the main target organs in a dietary intervention with fatty acids. since the intestine contributes to a significant extend to the resting metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure  <cit> , it is of relevance to also understand the effects on this organ. recent studies  <cit>  also showed a clear and significant difference of intestinal gene expression between diets high in diacylglycerol versus triacylglycerol, indicating a profound contribution of the small intestine to fatty acid metabolism. moreover, induction of lipid catabolism genes in the intestine may be involved in the anti-obesity effect of diacylglycerols as compared with triacylglycerols  <cit>  and it may even contribute to a differential sensitivity of two inbred mice strains to an obesogenic high-fat diet  <cit> .

since the most prominent health benefits have been associated with the long-chain n- <dig> pufa of marine origin , we have investigated the molecular effects of eicosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid  in n- <dig> high-fat diets. these diets, which do not differ in the total amount of fat relative to control, will be further referred to as epa&dha. in our previous studies using similar diets, we showed an anti-adipogenic effect of epa&dha  <cit> , which was associated with induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in wat, but not in the liver  <cit> .

we hypothesized that, using long-term dietary intervention studies, dietary fatty acid composition may modulate gene expression and lipid metabolism in the intestine, and that especially epa and dha may stimulate expression of genes involved in lipid catabolism. to examine this, we performed gene expression analysis of the mouse small intestine and colon, using whole genome oligonucleotide arrays and validation experiments using quantitative real time pcr . results were confirmed in an additional animal experiment by both qrt-pcr and functional intestinal fatty acid beta oxidation measurements.

RESULTS
phenotypic effects of epa&dha
dietary intervention with epa&dha in wildtype mice resulted in anti-adipogenic and anti-diabetic effects as described before: significantly lower body weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight, while food intake was non-significantly different  <cit> . furthermore, the intake of epa&dha increased adiponectin expression and secretion from wat, and protected the mice against induction of insulin resistance by the high-fat diet  <cit> . indeed, glucose tolerance tests showed significantly increased glucose tolerance  by increasing amounts of epa&dha in the diets, correlating with decreased fasting plasma insulin levels . this was associated with induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in wat based on gene and protein expression, but not in the liver  <cit> . however, the role of the intestine in the improved whole-body metabolic phenotype has not yet been analysed in detail.

effects of epa&dha on small intestinal gene expression; analysis of genes expressed in both control and intervention group
to investigate the effects of epa&dha on gene expression in the intestinal tract, we isolated rna from scrapings from small intestine of mice following a 4-week dietary intervention. we compared, using whole genome microarray analysis as initial step, the control shf diet, which was rich in ala and free of epa or dha, with the isocaloric shff-f <dig> diet, in which 44% of lipids were replaced by an epa and dha concentrate.

in total,  <dig> probesets, corresponding to  <dig> well-annotated genes, showed a significant regulation with an absolute fold change  ≥  <dig>  . this list of  <dig> genes comprised  <dig> unique genes, and increased expression was observed for  <dig>  unique genes, while  <dig>  unique genes showed decreased expression . functional interpretation using gene ontology and pathway analysis showed metabolism as highly regulated, which included changes in fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis, amongst others. of note, most, if not all, pathways selected were linked together by the energy molecule acetyl-coa. the approach using a fc ≥  <dig>  as threshold resulted in a similar list of regulated pathways, of which metabolism, and especially lipid metabolism ranked highest . since it is known that a dietary intervention at physiological levels generally gives small effects on gene expression changes , and the sufficiently large group of genes with fc ≥  <dig> , we focussed on those  <dig> unique, differentially expressed genes .

unique genes  are classified in  <dig> processes, and ranked on total number of genes per process. number of genes upregulated or downregulated by epa&dha in small intestine is as indicated.

detailed inspection of the expression data  revealed that epa&dha induced expression of the genes involved in branched chain and/or straight chain fatty acid β-oxidation occurring in peroxisomes and mitochondria, and fatty acid ω-oxidation, the latter is indicated by the increased expression of cyp4a <dig> . furthermore, induction of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor gene pex11a  might imply an increase in the number of peroxisomes.

in mitochondria, β-oxidation downstream of peroxisomal branched chain oxidation was upregulated by epa&dha, as suggested by increased expression of the genes cpt1a , and hadhb  amongst others. activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase  <dig>  is rate-limiting in mitochondrial fatty acid uptake for β-oxidation. the gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl-coa synthase  was also very strongly upregulated , in accordance with the fact that in liver this enzyme is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of ketone bodies from the acetyl-coa generated by fatty acid β-oxidation. importantly, also expression of pdk <dig> was increased by epa&dha , which strongly suggested a switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . many of the aforementioned genes are targets of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  alpha  <cit> , which itself was also upregulated by epa&dha .

cholesterol uptake from the lumen into intestinal tissue was increased as observed by increased gene expression of cd <dig>  and scarb <dig>   <cit> . simultaneously, of the  <dig> genes included in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway from acetyl-coa to cholesterol,  <dig> were not expressed, while the majority showed an inhibition by epa&dha, including the rate-limiting enzyme squalene epoxidase . clearly, such a cooperative inhibition of the majority of the genes in this pathway suggests an orchestrated function within the small intestine. however, the main transcription factor regulating this pathway, srebf <dig> , did not show differential expression. regulation by n- <dig> pufas was likely given the fact that we could not detect a difference in the cholesterol content between the two diets , but the exact mechanisms involved remain unexplained. finally, downstream steroid hormone biosynthesis was upregulated as shown by a few family members of hsd3b  and hsd17b .

transcription factor identification by promoter analysis
literature data and annotation analysis was used to filter the set of regulated genes . from the resulting  <dig> unique genes the promoter region was retrieved, which was used for enrichment analysis of transcription factor binding sites . this resulted in a network of  <dig> genes and linked transcription factors  that comprised  <dig> unique input genes, including two tfs , and another  <dig> non-regulated tfs . the majority of differentially regulated genes contained binding sites for two transcription factors: pparalpha , which itself was significantly differentially regulated , and nf-κb . these data are in line with the well-known capacity of fatty acids to activate pparalpha  <cit> , as well as their known effects on nf-κb and stat <dig>  <cit> .

effects of epa&dha on small intestinal gene expression; analysis of genes expressed exclusively in either control or intervention group
in addition to the genes that showed expression above the threshold in both groups, we also analysed the  <dig> probesets being expressed in only one diet group and showing differential expression. we focused on those genes showing a fc ≥  <dig> . in this way, fidelity of the dataset is within acceptable limits as most of these genes are expressed at low abundance. this resulted in  <dig> unique genes expressed only in the mice fed the epa&dha diet, while  <dig> unique genes showed only expression in the control group. all genes were classified into biological processes , which largely overlapped with the pathways identified using the first subset. of note, metabolism was also ranked highest, among which are the lipid metabolism genes acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase-β , cpa <dig>  and the peroxisomal protein encoded by acot <dig>  which all showed an induction from being absent in the control group to clear expression in epa&dha dietary group.

annotated, unique genes  were classified in biological processes. processes were ranked on total number of genes being differentially expressed in small intestine.

inter-individual variation analysis and confirmation by real time qrt-pcr
confirmation of differentially expressed genes was first performed using qrt-pcr. we selected a large panel of target genes covering multiple pathways and absolute fc values ranging from  <dig>  to >  <dig>  expression changes  were confirmed for all genes  and the fc was quite similar in all cases when compared to the microarray data.

genes are sorted alphabetically. in several cases gene family members were included for validation, although they did not show differential microarray gene expression. data is represented by ratio of epa&dha/control diet. for qrt-pcr, data shown is obtained using a pool of samples , and/or individual samples  and the mean ratio was calculated. a this probeset is non-expressed  in control diet; ratio is  <dig> ; b n.c.: not changed. c n.d.: not analyzed; statistical significance was calculated using student's t-test: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> .

to investigate in more detail inter-individual variation in gene expression and significance of the induced gene expression changes by nutritional treatment, we selected the following  <dig> genes representing the major pathways being influenced by the diet intervention : fatty acid β-oxidation in peroxisomes  and mitochondria , the switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation , biosynthesis of steroid hormones , and biosynthesis of cholesterol . for all genes we observed that the mean gene expression ratios  were similar to the observed ratios by microarray analysis of pooled samples. more importantly, gene expression changes using individual samples were statistically significant for all genes .

colon
the genes acaa1a, cpt1a, and sqle, representing three pathways differentially regulated in small intestine, were analyzed by qrt-pcr in individual colon samples . in none of the cases a significant difference in gene expression was observed . exclusion of the two animals from the control group which showed lowest expression for these three genes  did not influence the outcome of this analysis . this underscores the different function of the small intestine  and the colon .

biological and physiological validation in 2nd animal experiment
to further validate the observed significant gene expression changes, we performed an independent second animal experiment and analysed small intestinal gene expression by qrt-pcr. moreover, the increased gene expression suggesting increased intestinal fatty acid beta oxidation was functionally analysed, and finally, we used two epa&dha diets in order to investigate a dose-response relationship. in this experiment, chf-based diets were used. although the micronutrient composition of the control chf diet is not defined as precisely as the semisynthetic shff diet used in the first experiment, and it is based on  corn oil rather than on  flaxseed, the control chf diet promotes accumulation of fat much better compared with the shff diet and hence it allows for the detection of the anti-obesity effect of n- <dig> pufa  <cit> . in addition to the control chf diet, also two other chf-based diets with  <dig> and 44% of its lipids replaced by epa&dha  were used. gene expression analysis of genes involved in mitochondrial beta oxidation  independently and significantly confirmed the observed significant differences . moreover, these results showed a significant dose-response effect: increased gene expression upon increased epa&dha content in the diets . furthermore, functional analysis indeed showed a significant dose-dependent increase in intestinal fatty acid beta oxidation upon increased epa&dha content in the diet compared to control diet: lowest levels in the control group, intermediate increased levels in the chf-f <dig> group and highest levels in the chf-f <dig> group .

discussion
dietary intake of epa&dha induced changes in gene expression in the small intestine, including many metabolic genes. especially genes involved in lipid catabolism were upregulated. in contrast, a large cluster of the genes engaged in cholesterol biosynthesis was downregulated. importantly, all these effects were specifically induced by long-chain n- <dig> pufa, epa and dha, as compared with their precursor ala, and could not be detected in the colon for a selected set of genes.

it is tempting to suggest that increased catabolism of lipids induced by epa&dha in the small intestine contributes to the complex and beneficial effects of n- <dig> pufa of marine origin. the small intestine mediates the entry of nutritional lipids and is one of the main sites of β-oxidation  <cit> . therefore, an increase in lipid oxidation in the intestine may exert a hypolipidemic effect, i.e. one of the most pronounced effects of epa and dha in mammals . this effect of epa&dha in the intestine is surprisingly similar to the enhanced lipid oxidation induced by diacylglycerols versus triacylglycerols  <cit> . these two types of treatments both have relatively little effects in liver and muscle . in contrast, in white adipose tissue, intake of epa&dha induced genes of fatty acid oxidation, as well as quite specifically, mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . taken together, epa and dha orchestrate gene expression adaptations in many tissues, including the intestine.

recent studies addressing the gene expression changes of intestinal tissue upon fish oil or fatty acids, focussed on barrier genes only  <cit>  or a focussed limited number of genes by qrt-pcr  <cit> , while here a whole genome approach was used. this allows for detection of changes not only in the most likely pathways, but also in pathways not foreseen. our study supports the findings by mori et al.  <cit>  for the majority of their selected genes analyzed , as well as for barrier gene expression . unexpectedly, we observed intestinal downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis due to epa&dha, although this is in agreement with a similar effect observed in murine livers after tuna fish oil feeding  <cit> . in addition, this might coincide with a possible increase in cholesterol absorption as observed from scarb <dig>  cd <dig>  abca <dig> and ela3b gene expression, even with identical cholesterol content of the diets. intracellular homeostasis may decrease cholesterol biosynthesis to counteract increased influx. maintenance of homeostasis is supported by non differential expression of soat2/acat, involved in cholesterol esterification and of other genes in cholesterol metabolism  and nr1h <dig> ). the intestinal lack of regulation of srebf1/srebp further strengthen the observations that pufa regulation of srebp that accounts for pufa-mediated suppression of gene expression seems to be liver-specific  <cit> . furthermore, of the regulatory machine known to be induced by dha and epa , only pparα showed differential expression in murine small intestine. this is further supported by our promoter-analysis of the differentially regulated genes, which showed pparα as the major transcription factor involved.

moreover, most if not all tissues analysed thus far show an increased energy metabolism upon n- <dig> ffa, and our results support the notion of the beneficial effects of fish oils independent of its n- <dig> effect.

genes engaged in lipid oxidation and ketogenesis are in general upregulated in small intestine  <cit> , liver  <cit> , and skeletal muscle  <cit>  by an increase in dietary fat content. when activated in the muscle, ketogenesis marks a metabolic disconnection between β-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle and could lead to insulin resistance  <cit> . in our study however, we compared diets with equal fat content in control and intervention groups, which only differed in their fatty acid composition. this implies that marine pufas specifically induce lipid catabolism in intestine. furthermore, in comparison with another high fat western diet  <cit> , we observed similar  gene expression regulation by epa&dha diet , as well as an inverse regulation . differences might be explained by the fatty acid content in the diets used.

despite decreased adiposity due to epa&dha in the diet, these fatty acids have not affected total energy intake  <cit> , and also content of lipids in faeces was unaffected  <cit> . this strongly suggests a higher energy expenditure in the animals exposed to epa&dha. the results presented here indicate that one of the organs that physiologically contribute to increased oxidation of fatty acids is the small intestine.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we present data showing the involvement of small intestine in the complex changes of lipid metabolism exerted by long term dietary intake of epa and dha by gene expression analysis and functional ex-vivo beta oxidation analysis. furthermore, we show that these effects are regulated in a dose-dependent manner. in view of its large contribution to overall energy metabolism, modulation of gene expression and metabolism in the intestine by dietary lipids, and especially long-chain n- <dig> pufa of marine origin, represents a promising target for the prevention of obesity and associated co-morbidities.
