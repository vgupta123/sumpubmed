BACKGROUND
the serum levels of immunoglobulins  are the result of regulated processes involving b cell development and the progressive expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain  genes  <cit> . during b cell differentiation, igh locus  undergoes various dna rearrangements and epigenetic changes, necessary for the generation of antibody repertoire  <cit> .

the regulatory region 3′rr at the 3′ of the constant alpha gene is in single copy in rodents and in two copies in apes due to a large duplication described in figure  <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
hs <dig>  location and known human variants. a) the locus of the ig heavy chain with the variable, constant and regulatory elements. the three enhancers of 3′rr <dig> and 3′rr <dig> are conserved in order: hs <dig> , hs <dig>  , hs <dig> . nevertheless, hs <dig>  sequence is inverted in 3′rr <dig> with respect to the 3′rr <dig>  b) regulatory regions at the 3′ of the constant alpha <dig> and alpha <dig> genes . a 20 bp conserved repeats is shown in violet, while the palindromic regions in light blue. c) scheme of the six variants of the enhancer hs <dig>  known in human .



the human igh locus is characterized by two 3′ regulatory regions  caused by a duplication, both downstream with respect to heavy chain alpha  genes . each 3′rr is composed of three different enhancers. in both cases the central enhancer hs <dig>  is located in one region with a palindromic sequence conserved in structure but not in sequence  <cit>  and contains a 40-bp tandem-repeat dna motif, polymorphic for number of copies and conserved in different species of mammals  <cit> . in humans this 40 bp region is repeated from one to four times. the hs <dig>  allele with two copies of 40 bp element is called allele * <dig> and carries a unique binding site for nf-κb transcription factor  <cit> . in the machinery of the ig maturation the class switches when igg <dig>  igg <dig>  iga <dig> and ige are produced. since 3′rr <dig> is deleted along with the rest of the heavy chain involved in the excision, the switched allele will be under the control of the 3′rr <dig>  of note, more then 95% of human subjects bear * <dig> allele of hs <dig>  in 3′rr <dig> giving a high homogeneity of the expression and not the variability observed for 3′rr <dig> . different selective advantages or disadvantages are related to possible different functions. hs <dig>  allele * <dig> in the distal 3′rr <dig> is significantly more frequent in patients with several autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus erythematosus with respect to healthy control group  <cit> , and is associated with high levels of igm in peripheral blood  <cit> . of note, patients with iga deficiency show a significant correlation with hs <dig>  allele * <dig>  <cit> . finally, new evidence have been reported on the differences among hs <dig>  polymorphic variants indicating complex interactions between binding factors and enhancers after stimulation of mouse and human b cells  <cit> .

it has already been described that follow-up of children through adulthood shows a gradual increase of ig concentrations in serum  <cit> . therefore, in order to determine if there is a genetic correlation between hs <dig>  alleles and the levels of circulating ig in children and adults, we compared the concentration of circulating ig in association with allelic frequency of hs <dig>  enhancer in one cohort of adults and one of young healthy subjects. our data show that the igm, igg and iga serum concentrations are significantly associated with the hs <dig>  alleles in youth, but not in adult population, suggesting a fundamental role of hs <dig>  enhancer variants in the ig expression in children.

RESULTS
one cohort of healthy children and one of adults were recruited and measured for the ig serum levels. individuals were divided in three groups with low, medium and high serum levels with respect to the ig median of each cohort . the ig levels were all in the normal range. table 1a-b shows the allelic frequencies for both cohorts within each ig class and reports that hs <dig>  alleles are associated with ig serum levels in children, but not in adults . in fact, the comparison of low  vs high  and medium  vs h serum levels of ig shows highly significant different allelic frequencies , only in the population of children. similar variations of * <dig> and * <dig> allele frequencies in children were observed in each ig class of young cohort: the * <dig> allele frequency decreases from the range of 41%-49% in l and m groups to the range of 2%-5% in h group and, on the contrary, * <dig> allele frequency increased from the range of 39%-49% in l and m groups to the range of 79%-82% in h group. it is remarkable that no young subjects homozygous for * <dig> allele were included in the h groups of igm and igg, and only one young subject was present in the h group of iga. the frequencies of 2/ <dig> homozygous genotype in children of l and m groups were between  <dig> %- <dig> %, while the h group of each ig class was comprised between  <dig> %- <dig> %. in children and adults, the medians of ig level were very similar, in agreement with the ranges reported in literature  <cit>  . nevertheless, the adult cohort did not show the same level and significance of allelic frequency variations than children when subdivided for ig levels in l, m, and h groups . consequently the probability of one subject to be in one group of ig level and also in the same group for the other ig classes is very high in children, but not in adults . the genetic association between ig concentrations and hs <dig>  polymorphism suggests likely age-related changes in ig expression for children homozygous for * <dig> or * <dig> allele. therefore, we followed up the ig levels of those children for three years. as reported in table  <dig>  after three years  * <dig> allele homozygous children showed an increase of igg and iga levels, while * <dig> allele homozygous children showed a decrease in all ig levels. we also investigated if b cell subpopulations of peripheral blood were similar in two homozygous groups by flow cytometric analysis, using igm and igd surface cell markers for the distribution of naive, marginal zone, igm memory and switched memory b cells . children homozygous for * <dig> and * <dig> alleles show no differences in the distribution of b cell subtypes, suggesting moreover that the number of b subtypes of circulating cells does not influence igm concentration in individual with different genotype .table  <dig>

follow-up of ig concentrations in children homozygous for hs <dig>  * <dig> and * <dig> alleles.

the children cohort  was tested at time  <dig> and three years later. the t test shows a high significance for all the differences in the ig median levels of 2/ <dig> homozygous children, whereas the differences in 1/ <dig> children were always not significant.



previous evidence showed the association of ig levels with 3′rr <dig> enhancer hs <dig>  polymorphism in autoimmune diseases. in these experiments we studied the role of hs <dig>  polymorphism in physiological conditions in healthy subjects. our results show that in children there is a significant correlation between different hs <dig>  alleles and ig expression levels, suggesting that hs <dig>  polymorphism might primarily influence the concentration of ig classes in serum during childhood. moreover the follow-up of the children homozygous for the * <dig> allele showed that, after the fifth year of age, the ig median values for all three classes increase; instead, in subjects homozygous for the * <dig> allele the values strongly decrease. this trend leads to the final adult equilibrium observed where no correlation is shown with ig levels and hs <dig>  alleles.

CONCLUSIONS
our data imply that during physiological development there is a switch of regulatory mechanisms involved in ig expression that might be reverted in autoimmune diseases  <cit> . the similar distribution of b cells subpopulations in homozygous children for * <dig> and * <dig> alleles  suggests that the different ig levels are obtained by different ig secretion of the cells and not by the different number of b cells.

in conclusion we like assessing that there is a mechanism, correlated to hs <dig>  polymorphism, that in children leads to a parallel control of iga, igg and igm, while in adulthood changes to produce the three ig classes at different concentrations.

these observations raise the possibility that in children the polymorphism of the hs <dig>  enhancer is a relevant component in regulatory mechanism involved in ig expression. the presence in europe of higher * <dig> allele  <cit>  and these results related to ig levels in children can give an explanation for the selective advantage of the allele balanced by the disadvantage in adulthood for the association to autoimmune disease. it must be mentioned that in humans the presence of two copies of hs <dig>  derived by the duplication of the 3′rr can give the possibility to the alleles of the first copy at 3′ of alpha- <dig> to influence the regulation otherwise absent if the gamma 2/ <dig>  epsilon and alpha- <dig> switch occurs.

moreover this evidence answers the question about the function of the alleles. in fact, the positive association of * <dig> allele with high ig levels in childhood could be the reason for the positive selection after the migration out of africa: a condition of shorter life expectancy could have led to a reduced risk for immune-diseases development.

nevertheless, further studies will be required to address the role of hs <dig>  during aging.
