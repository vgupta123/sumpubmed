BACKGROUND
honey bees are an outstanding model system for studying the molecular, physiological and social basis of disease transmission and resistance. honey bees are plagued by a number of parasites and pathogens , and the social colony environment  provides excellent conditions for disease transmission. while the innate immune systems of invertebrates and vertebrates are surprisingly conserved 
 <cit> , there can be large differences in the numbers of genes involved in the different molecular arms of the immune response system across species. as is the case with many insects with recently sequenced genomes 
 <cit> , bees have a much smaller number of known canonical immune response genes relative to drosophila <cit> , which is one of the best characterized models of insect immunity 
 <cit> . thus, bees  may utilize alternative genetic and physiological mechanisms to respond to infections. furthermore, honey bees can resist pathogens and parasites by employing sophisticated behavioral defense mechanisms, termed “social immunity” . here, we examine the effects of a panel of general immune elicitors  on worker-worker social interactions and chemical communication, and use whole-genome microarrays to characterize global gene expression responses to these immune elicitors.

honey bee populations have been in decline worldwide, with beekeepers recently reporting massive annual losses  . this decline is undoubtedly due in part to the multitude of parasites and pathogens that target honey bees, several of which have only recently been identified. honey bees are host to over  <dig> viruses 
 <cit> , as well as a number of bacterial and fungal pathogens 
 <cit>  including the gut microspordian parasites nosema apis and nosema ceranae. honey bees are also severely impacted by varroa mites , tracheal mites  and other ectoparasites 
 <cit> ).

sequencing of the honey bee genome identified  <dig> genes associated with the canonical immune response pathways in insects 
 <cit> . innate immune pathways in insects, mostly obtained from studies in drosophila, consists of both cellular and humoral responses, which can be systemic or local . cellular immune responses involve a number of differentiated hemocytes. pathogens activate phenoloxidase and associated immune cascades, resulting in phagocytosis, encapsulation, and/or melanization of invading organisms or wounds. humoral responses include cytotoxic molecules , lysozymes, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides . amps are primarily produced by the fat bodies in insects. a number of signal transduction pathways are involved in moderating immune responses, including the jak/stat , jnk , imd , and spaetzle/toll  pathways. activation of one of these signal transduction pathways may lead to up- or down-regulation of the others depending on the host-parasite system. for example, studies in drosophila have shown that the relationships between immune pathways and effectors can be highly pathogen specific and much still remains to be characterized 
 <cit> . furthermore, canonical pathways derived from drosophila experiments, may not be fully generalizable to other systems.

honey bees also employ a number of behavioral mechanisms – termed “social immunity” – to reduce the impacts of parasites and diseases . grooming can remove ectoparasites, and hygienic behavior can reduce levels of brood diseases and depress varroa mite populations . workers also coat the interior of their colonies with propolis , which has antimicrobial properties and results in lowered levels of immune response genes in individual bees 
 <cit> . furthermore, diseased or otherwise stressed bees undergo accelerated behavioral maturation, moving from in-hive tasks to foraging, which removes them from the brood nest and colony, thereby potentially reducing transmission 
 <cit> . finally, studies in termites suggest that healthy nestmates can become “socially vaccinated” by exposure to infected nestmates, thereby improving their resistance to a pathogen 
 <cit> . future investigations may uncover similar defense mechanisms in honey bees.

honey bees can also use cuticular hydrocarbons as chemical cues to distinguish between healthy and immuno-stimulated adult nestmates, and respond differently to them 
 <cit> . cuticular hydrocarbons are synthesized in oenocytes, which are embedded in the fat body tissue under the epithelia, and deposited on the cuticular surface 
 <cit> . cuticular hydrocarbon patterns can be modified by genotype, physiological state, and environmental context , including social status in honey bees 
 <cit> . immunostimulation of honey bee workers with lipopolysaccharides derived from bacterial cell walls caused significant changes in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles in worker bees after four hours, and resulted in altered social interactions 
 <cit> . healthy bees were more aggressive towards their nestmates that were coated with extracts of immunostimulated nestmates than to nestmates that were coated with extracts of healthy nestmates, indicating that these changes in chemical profile could alter worker-worker interactions. other studies have demonstrated that varroa parasitized pupae and adults have modified cuticular hydrocarbon profiles 
 <cit> , while infection with a virus can elicit aggressive reactions from healthy nestmates in a colony 
 <cit> .

here, we examined the behavioral, chemical and molecular responses in honey bee workers to injection with saline, sephadex beads, and gram-negative bacteria , six hours after injection. we determined if these different immune elicitors stimulate unique responses at these three levels; for example, theoretically only e. coli injection should activate the imd pathway, which could lead to distinct chemical profiles and behavioral responses. we also determined if immunostimulation resulted in significantly altered expression of previously annotated honey bee immune genes 
 <cit> , if there was overlap with other studies of the effects of immunochallenge or parasitization in honey bees and drosophila <cit> , and if there were changes in expression of genes associated with cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways.

RESULTS
pilot study on the effects of immune elicitors on locomotion and mortality
lethality of our treatments was assessed 8 hours after treatment, in a pilot study using bees from colony  <dig>  after treatment,  <dig> out of  <dig> of the control  and  <dig> of the  <dig> bead- or bacteria-injected individuals died, respectively. none of the saline-injected workers died.

the behavioral effects of treatments  were individually assessed on isolated bees placed in circular arenas for 5 minutes as in 
 <cit> . statistical analyses revealed no significant effects of treatments on general activity = <dig> ; p= <dig> ) or locomotion = <dig> ; p =  <dig> ).

effects of immune elicitors on social interactions
to monitor social interactions, we used a nestmate recognition assay in which an individual, 6 hours after treatment, was returned to her cage with her original nestmates and social interactions were monitored.  <dig> bees from colony  <dig>  separated in  <dig> petri dishes, were used for this experiment. this assay has been used regularly in bees and ants to examine nestmate recognition 
 <cit> . as in the pilot study with isolated individual bees, there was no effect of treatment on locomotion =− <dig> ; p> <dig> ).

to assess social interactions, agonistic and non-agonistic contacts were analyzed by calculating a global aggression index . the total aggression index was significantly different among the four groups = <dig> ; p< <dig> ). pairwise comparisons revealed a significantly higher aggression index toward bacteria-injected workers compared to control, saline-injected and bead-injected workers .

furthermore, unlike the pilot study with isolated bees, the frequency of self-grooming behavior was significantly lower in bacteria-injected workers compared to control and saline-injected workers, while self-grooming by bead-injected workers was intermediate  =  <dig>  p = <dig>  followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons p< <dig> , figure 
1b). however, bacteria-injected workers were the targets of significantly higher allo-grooming behavior than control workers, while saline- and bead-injected workers were intermediate  = <dig>  p = <dig>  followed by pairwise comparisons p< <dig> , figure 
1b).

effects of immune elicitors on cuticular hydrocarbon profiles
non-polar compounds were extracted from honey bee workers using pentane, and chemical profiles of cuticular extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography . in our experimental conditions, all the chemical compounds we identified by mass spectrometry  analysis were hydrocarbons.

the relative proportions of the cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from all four treatment groups from colony  <dig> were significantly different = <dig> ; p< <dig> , figure 
2a and table 
2). mahalanobis distances between all groups were significantly different . we obtained similar results for colony  <dig> = <dig> ; p < <dig> , figure 
2b and table 
3). mahalanobis distances between all groups were significantly different, except between saline- and bead- injected workers .

data for this figure were obtained from gas chromatography analysis of cuticular washes of worker bees from colony  <dig>  these data represent the relative proportions of each compound found within each of the four treatment groups.

data for this figure were obtained from gas chromatography analysis of cuticular washes of worker bees from colony  <dig>  these data represent the relative proportions of each compound found within each of the four treatment groups.

discriminant analyses based on the absolute quantities of cuticular chemical compounds also revealed significant differences between the four treatment groups = <dig> ; p< <dig>  for colony  <dig>  figure 
 <dig>  and f= <dig> ; p< <dig>  for colony  <dig>  data not shown). there did not appear to be a significant and consistent effect of treatment on the relative proportions or quantities of any of the major chemical classes across the two colonies. the total quantity of branched alkanes decreased in both colonies in the bacteria-injected workers, but this difference was not significant .

global gene expression responses to immunostimulation
microarrays were used to monitor global gene expression patterns in the eviscerated abdomens  of bees from the four treatment groups. we examined all transcript expression levels across all pairs of treatment groups for significant differences  and found that  <dig> unique transcripts were significantly regulated among treatment groups in colony  <dig>  and  <dig> unique transcripts were significantly regulated among treatment groups in colony  <dig>  for a list of transcripts). thus, expression levels for these transcripts were significantly different between at least two of the treatment groups. of these,  <dig> transcripts were significantly regulated in both colonies . this overlap in transcript expression was greater than expected by chance . the higher numbers of transcripts in colony  <dig> may be due to the lower number of biological replicates  or the effect of genetic background, which can strongly affect responses to immunostimulation 
 <cit> . despite some differences in relative expression patterns for individual transcripts across colonies, hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> common transcripts revealed the same overall clustering of treatment groups, . treated groups clustered separately from control groups, and saline- and bead-injected groups clustered separately from the bacteria- injected group. relative-fold expression values for these transcripts across all of the treatment groups can be found in , and the associated p-values for the pairwise comparisons between treatments can be found in .

effects of individual immune elicitors on gene expression
pairwise comparisons identified sets of transcripts differentially regulated between saline-, bead-, bacteria-injected bees and the control bees . overlap between colonies for each treatment-control comparison was significantly greater than expected by chance .  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts, respectively, were significantly regulated in these pairwise comparisons in both colonies, though these transcripts did not necessarily show the same directional patterns of expression between colonies. while each treatment resulted in significant expression changes in a unique set of transcripts relative to controls, there was considerable overlap across treatment groups . indeed,  <dig> transcripts were significantly regulated by all three treatments .

fisher exact tests found more overlap than expected  for significantly, differentially expressed transcripts  in the saline-, bead- and bacteria-injected vs control groups between the two colonies.

*duplicate transcripts between groups removed.

functional analysis of regulated genes
gene ontology analysis of the significantly regulated  <dig> transcripts found in both colonies  revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in immune response, spermatogenesis, wing disc dorsal/ventral pattern formation, tissue development, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and protein polymerization . however, none of these categories survived the benjamini correction. immune genes corresponding to the major immune pathways were significantly regulated . pale , a tyrosine hydroxylase involved in melanization and wound repair, was also significantly up-regulated by bacteria, bead and saline injection in colony  <dig> and bacteria and bead injection in colony  <dig> 
 <cit> . other genes included those involved in cell growth and proliferation , cytoskeleton structure , extracellular matrix components , notch signaling , phagocytosis , and cabut, which encodes a transcription factor that is regulated by the jnk cascade 
 <cit> .

of the  <dig> transcripts  significantly regulated by injection with saline, beads, and bacteria relative to controls, two categories were significantly overrepresented: organ morphogenesis, p< <dig> , and developmental process, p< <dig>  . again, neither of these categories survived the benjamini correction. several of the previously discussed genes  are part of this group, as well a serine protease immune response integrator  which functions in toll pathway activation 
 <cit> . notably, two genes involved in lipid metabolism were also found in this group, which is of particular interest since fatty acids are the precursors of cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis in insects . bubblegum  encodes a very long chain fatty acid coa ligase, which plays a role in fatty acid metabolism, and was down-regulated in the treatment groups 
 <cit> . lipid-storage droplet  <dig>  is involved in lipid storage and accumulation, and was up-regulated in the treatment groups 
 <cit> . lipid storage droplet  <dig> , a component of lipid droplets in fat bodies 
 <cit> , was found to be significantly down-regulated in both colonies, but not by all treatments.

go analysis of the  <dig> transcripts whose expression was specifically altered in bacteria-injected workers  yielded only one significantly overrepresented cluster . these genes included cactus, kayak, draper, defensin- <dig>  relish, pgrp-sc <dig>  other regulated genes included those that may be involved in metabolism, such as gr28b, a gustatory receptor that seems to mediate diet-related changes in immune response 
 <cit> , sorbital dehydrogenase- <dig> , an alcohol dehydrogenase of sugars 
 <cit> , and trehalose-6-phospate synthetase  <dig>  which may play a role in protection from hypoxia and anoxic injury 
 <cit> . see additional file 
1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> for a listing of the bacteria-regulated genes and go categories.

comparisons of gene expression patterns with previous studies
we examined overlap in gene expression patterns between our study and previous studies in honey bees and drosophila. it is important to note that there were large differences in study design  as well as gene expression platform and statistical analyses, which makes direct comparisons challenging. however we sought to identify common regulated genes that could indicate conserved immune response mechanisms across different host organisms and pathogen challenges.

fourteen genes were found in common between the significantly regulated  <dig> transcripts  and the canonical immune response genes annotated from the honey bee genome by evans and colleagues 
 <cit>  . this overlap was significantly greater than expected by chance . however, clearly the majority of significantly regulated genes are not members of these canonical immune response pathways.

the  <dig> genes that were significantly regulated by immunostimulation in both colonies in our study were matched to 239 gb numbers and compared with the immune genes identified during annotation of the genome , and genes significantly regulated by varroa parasitization of honey bees . a fischer’s exact test was used to determine if this overlap was significant, assuming that all genes present in the background lists for the arrays were in common between studies. in order to ascertain overlap, only genes in previous studies that were present on our array platform were included.

navajas et al. 
 <cit>  performed a microarray analysis of control and varroa mite-parasitized honey bee pupae from two strains . expression levels of  <dig> genes  were significantly altered by varroa parasitization. there was no significant overlap with the  <dig> transcripts  in the current study . however, two genes, including ple, were regulated in both studies, though directionality was not necessarily conserved between studies.

in a separate study, alaux and colleagues examined the effects of varroa parasitization and nutrition on honey bee worker gene expression using an rna-seq approach 
 <cit> . we compared our  <dig> regulated transcripts  with the list of genes that were significantly, differentially regulated by mite parasitization in pollen-fed bees and found  <dig> overlapping genes, including genes involved in immune and metabolic processes. though directionality was not necessarily conserved between studies, the overlap was greater than expected by chance . bgm, lsd- <dig>  and domeless were among the genes significantly regulated in both studies. a go analysis of the overlapping transcripts  found one significantly overrepresented category which did not survive benjamini correction .

finally, we compared the  <dig> significantly regulated transcripts in our study  with significantly regulated genes in two separate studies examining immune response in fruit flies. de gregario and colleagues 
 <cit>  identified  <dig> significantly regulated genes after septic injury of male drosophila with bacteria contaminated needles or feeding with fungal spores . roxstrom-linquist and colleagues 
 <cit>  identified approximately  <dig> upregulated genes  in drosophila melanogaster orally infected with protozoa, viruses, bacteria or fungi. eight genes were found in all three studies , including a number of genes with immune related functions: ple, cactus, defensin- <dig>  relish and pgrp-sc <dig>  serpin 28d  was also regulated in all three studies, and is involved in melanization 
 <cit> .

quantitative real-time pcr validation of expression of candidate genes
we examined expression levels of several candidate genes identified in the microarray study in a third biological replicate . three treatment groups were used: control, saline-injected, and bacteria-injected worker bees. as in the microarray study, defensin  <dig> levels increased with treatment, and were significantly higher in bacteria-injected bees relative to controls, and intermediate in saline-injected bees = <dig> , p= <dig> , see figure 
 <dig> for results of tukey hsd post-hoc pairwise comparisons and additional file 
1: table s3a for expression levels obtained from the microarray analysis). as in the microarray study, levels of bubblegum decreased significantly with treatment = <dig> , p< <dig> ), while levels of lsd- <dig> = <dig> , p< <dig> ) and pale increased =  <dig> , p< <dig> ). similar to the results of the microarray analysis, the effects of treatment on expression of three genes involved in notch signaling were less dramatic, but nonetheless expression of apterous = <dig> , p= <dig> ), groucho = <dig> , p= <dig> ) and pebbled = <dig> , p= <dig> ) were significantly affected by treatment. expression levels were higher in saline-injected bees than controls for all three genes, and higher in bacteria-injected bees relative to control bees for apterous.

discussion
we have demonstrated that immunostimulation of adult honey bee workers results in altered social interactions only in the case of bacteria-injected bees. however, all the treatment groups have significantly different cuticular hydrocarbon chemical profiles, and all treatments caused large scale changes in gene expression patterns in abdominal fat body and epithelial tissue, which includes oenocytes. it is important to note that these dramatic changes occurred in a relatively short timeframe, only six hours after immunostimulation. importantly, this study demonstrates that expression of a large number of genes, not just those canonically associated with immune response pathways, are modulated by immunostimulation, as has been demonstrated by several other studies of genome-wide responses to immune challenges . however, comparisons with studies in drosophila found limited overlap of gene expression patterns, and the handful of commonly regulated genes were key members of canonical immune response pathways.

it is somewhat perplexing that only bacteria-injected bees were subjected to significantly increased allo-grooming and aggression. all treatments caused changes in chemical profiles, and the changes did not appear to be substantially larger in bacteria-injected bees, though there was a trend for lower total quantity of branched alkanes in this group. however, previous studies have suggested that alkenes, rather than alkanes, play a significant role in nestmate recognition 
 <cit> . based on the hierarchical clustering analysis, the gene expression patterns of bacteria-injected bees were clearly distinct from saline- and bead-injected bees. however, overall it did not appear that bacterial injection altered expression of an entirely unique set of genes . thus, perhaps bacteria injection did not cause change in expression of a large, unique subset genes, but rather caused more substantial changes in the magnitude of expression levels of some genes, as indicated by hierarchical clustering. alternatively, it may be that expression of a few key genes and/or chemical profile components in bacteria-treated bees provoked behavioral changes in nestmates.

it remains to be determined if infection with honey bee specific parasites and pathogens causes similar changes in gene expression and behavioral responses, though there is some indication that infection with nosema microsporidia does stimulate expression changes in a significantly overlapping set of genes . it also remains to be determined if these behavioral changes are adaptive: it is possible that bees have evolved to “match” the strength of the signal to the virulence of the pathogen, and thus infection with bacteria would elicit a greater change in the behavioral responses of nestmates than simple cuticular wounding. however, colony-level assays would need to be performed in order to determine if these changes in social interactions actually result in differences in the spread of pathogens through the colony and their impacts on infected individuals. for example, the increased grooming behavior we observed towards bacteria-injected individuals could facilitate the spread of pathogens through the colony , slow the spread by causing isolation or removal of infected individuals 
 <cit>  or reduce the impact on the infected individual 
 <cit> .

our studies also demonstrate that immunostimulation elicits complex gene expression changes in the epithelial tissues in honey bee workers. immunostimulation resulted in significant expression changes of  <dig> common transcripts in worker bees from the two colonies examined. only  <dig> of these genes corresponded to previously annotated immune genes identified from the honey bee genome 
 <cit> . several other biological processes were modified, including cell growth and proliferation, cytoskelatal structure, metabolism and components of the notch signaling pathway. cell growth, proliferation, and migration, particularly involving actin-mediated cytoskeletal changes, are required for repairing epithelial wounds 
 <cit> . the notch signaling pathway has not yet been linked to immune response or wound repair, but wound repair uses many of the same developmental pathways that function during dorsal closure in drosophila development, which does involve notch signaling 
 <cit> . alternatively, since the insect fat body is involved in regulating many key processes, including metabolism , these changes may reflect general physiological changes after immunostimulation or stress 
 <cit> . expression changes in three genes of the notch signaling pathway  were confirmed using quantitative real-time pcr. interestingly, expression was significantly higher in saline-injected bees relative to controls for all three genes, but only expression of apterous was affected in bacteria-injected bees, suggesting that changes in notch signaling may be modulated temporally or by other signaling pathways.

we found significant expression changes of a number of key immune response genes . the jak/stat pathway is regulated by the domeless receptor; domeless expression was significantly regulated by immune stimulation in both genotypes of bees in our study. activation of the imd pathway requires cleavage of relish by the caspase dredd; both dredd and relish were significantly regulated in our study. we also observed significant regulation of pgrp-sc <dig> which suppresses activation the imd pathway, with bacteria-injected bees showing the highest levels of pgrp-sc <dig> expression . in fruit flies, pgrp-sc <dig> and pgr-sc <dig> may function in preventing over-activation of the imd pathway 
 <cit> . the imd pathway triggers the jnk pathway, which activates the transcriptional regulator ap- <dig> , and ap- <dig> in turn negatively regulates relish-dependent transcription. we found significant regulation of kayak in our study. interestingly, we also found significant changes in expression of cabut, which is regulated by the jnk pathway but has not yet been linked to immune function 
 <cit> . the toll pathway operates through transduction factors including spirit, which acts extracellularly and upstream of spaetzle 
 <cit>  and the nf-κb protein dorsal . we found significant regulation of spirit and cactus in our study. pale, which plays an important role in melanization and wound repair, and draper, which functions in phagocytosis, were also significantly regulated in our study. as a gram-negative bacteria, it would be expected that e. coli would primarily stimulate activation of the imd pathway. however, we observed changes in gene expression of members of the toll pathway, including cactus, spirit and defensin- <dig>  which exhibits gram-positive antimicrobial activity and is not regulated by the imd pathway 
 <cit> . thus, there is likely considerable cross-talk between the pathways.

our studies also identified several genes which may play a role in altering cuticular hydrocarbon patterns. cuticular hydrocarbons are synthesized primarily in the oenocytes , which are embedded in the fat body of adult honey bees 
 <cit> . cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis involves activation of fatty acids by an acyl-coa synthetase, chain elongations of fatty-acyl-coas to produce very long chain fatty acids, and subsequent conversion to a hydrocarbon, likely by a p <dig> enzyme 
 <cit> . fatty acids are stored in lipid droplets in the adipoctye cells of the insect fat body 
 <cit> . fatty acids can be released from droplets in the adipocytes and accumulate in the oenocytes; this occurs under starvation conditions in particular 
 <cit> . this process is mediated in part by lipid storage droplet- <dig> : increased lsd- <dig> expression in the fat bodies decreases lipid movement to the oenocytes. we found increased expression of lsd- <dig> in immunostimulated bees , suggesting reduced movement of lipids to oenocytes, and perhaps reduced levels of cuticular hydrocarbons. we did observe a decrease in the total relative quantity of all branched alkanes in bacteria-injected workers in both colonies but this difference was not significant.

bubblegum  activates long chain fatty acids to form acyl-coas , a key step in cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis. bgm was originally described as a drosophila mutant that resulted in elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids and neurodegeneration 
 <cit> . bgm homologs have been identified in numerous species, including humans and mice, and have been demonstrated to activate long chain  and very long chain  fatty acids 
 <cit> . in our study, bgm expression was significantly decreased relative to controls .

despite large differences in study designs and analysis methods, we found some overlap in gene expression with previous studies examining the effects of varroa mite parasitization on honey bees 
 <cit> . varroa-responsive genes were significantly associated with basic cellular processes, including cell organization, biogenesis and metabolism. we also found significant changes in functional categories associated with basic cellular processes, such as cell growth, proliferation and cytoskeletal structure. varroa parasitization also caused changes in expression of pale. as discussed above, this may represent cellular mechanisms for wound-healing. expression of potential hydrocarbon synthesis genes, namely bgm and lsd- <dig>  were also regulated by varroa parasitization. indeed, varroa parasitized pupae and adults have modified cuticular hydrocarbon profiles 
 <cit> . these differences are likely responsible for stimulating hygienic behavior, in which diseased larvae are removed by adult worker bees, a key component of varroa resistance 
 <cit> .

comparison with two previous studies 
 <cit>  examining the effects of immunostimulation on drosophila global gene expression patterns revealed conserved changes in expression of key immune genes in drosophila and honey bees , but otherwise limited overlap in the significantly regulated genes. the lack of similarity could represent species-specific immune responses or simply technical differences – for example, roxstrom-lindquist 
 <cit>  orally infected young male flies with bacteria, fungi and microsporidia, and measured whole-body gene expression changes in only two replicates using affymetrix microarrays.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that immunostimulation of honey bee workers causes significant changes in gene expression patterns, cuticular hydrocarbon chemical profiles, and, in the case of bacteria-injection, social behavior. while bacteria-injection did not cause expression changes in an entirely unique set of genes or production of unique cuticular hydrocarbons compared to other treatment groups, it does appear that the magnitude of the expression and production changes was greater, and this may have resulted in the altered behavioral responses. as demonstrated by other studies examining genome-wide expression changes associated with immune challenges 
 <cit> , we found that even a short-term immune challenge can result in dramatic changes in gene expression that encompass far more genes than those represented by canonical immune response pathways. for example, we found several genes associated with the notch signaling pathway, which suggests this pathway may also play a role in mediating immune responses. furthermore, our study has highlighted potentially new candidate genes for regulating cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis in insects. these chemicals serve many functions in insects, including operating as sex and caste-specific pheromones, and most research on their biosynthesis has focused on desaturase enzymes and p450s 
 <cit> . these studies lay the groundwork for future work examining the molecular pathways that mediate immune responses to acute stimulators and chronic infections in bees and other insects, and has paved the way for research into the genes that regulate social immunity.
