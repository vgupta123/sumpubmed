BACKGROUND
subterranean fauna provides unique opportunities for the study of evolutionary mechanisms and speciation processes  <cit> . in recent years, phylogeographic analyses have revealed unprecedented cases of cryptic speciation, restricted distribution and presumed sympatric speciation among different cave-dwelling animal groups  <cit> . nevertheless, the occurrence of extensive morphological conservatism in subterranean fauna frequently hampers the establishment of phylogenetic inferences based solely on morphological features. in this context, homoplasy arises from common exposure to the particular selective pressures inherent to cave life  or from the lack of directional selection  <cit> . conversely, isolation in caves can lead these morphologically undifferentiated subterranean organisms to display high levels of genetic divergence  <cit> .

geological and hydrological processes, in particular shifts in water tables, can lead to the isolation or connection of aquifers, with consequent effects on gene flow between populations of subterranean aquatic organisms  <cit> . in the same way, marine regressions are suggested to have played a major role in the isolation of many marine relicts in continental groundwaters  <cit> . recent molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies on subterranean amphipods emphasize the role played by historical factors  in the pattern of genetic diversification and distribution displayed by these animals  <cit> . likewise,  <cit>  considered the influence of contingency, i.e., whether the colonization event involved a single localized surface ancestor or multiple, geographically separated ancestors, on the shaping of these patterns. in addition, larval life history traits, such as feeding mode  can play a determinant role in crustacean distribution, as they control the duration of the dispersive phase  <cit> . however, stygobiont amphipods have a comparatively reduced dispersal potential , as the females carry offspring in a marsupium and these are brooded and not released into the water column until metamorphosed into diminutive non-natatory adults  <cit> .

among the obligate dwellers of subterranean waters , a high number belong to so-called thalassoid lineages, organisms that are derived directly from marine ancestors  <cit> . thalassoid forms are known to occur among a vast array of faunistic groups, especially the crustacea  <cit> . the ancestors of thalassoid animals presumably inhabited marine transitional habitats, such as submarine fissures, mixohaline submarine karstic springs or the interstitial medium developed in sandy and gravelly coastal sediments, where sharp variations in salinity  and other environmental conditions mimic, in some way, those found in fresh groundwaters  <cit> . colonization of inland freshwater aquifers by this preadapted marine fauna might have proceeded as a natural extension of their primary niche, followed by an adaptive shift; this process would be independent of the occurrence of environmental constraints, such as episodes of glaciation, drought or marine regression  <cit> . this hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the origin of some freshwater stygobiont ostracods closely related to marine euryhaline taxa  <cit> . however, most faunistic and biogeographic evidence favours an alternative vicariant scenario by which colonization occurs passively via stranding of ancestral populations during episodes of marine regression  <cit> . accordingly, sea withdrawal or tectonic uplift at different geological periods could have led to the gradual isolation of populations of ancestral marine taxa in inland groundwaters, triggering their ulterior diversification and speciation. this hypothesis explains satisfactorily the distribution of many stygobiont crustaceans and is testable by collating a phylogenetic framework and molecular-clock-age estimates of relevant clades, with their respective geographic distributions  <cit> .

here, we studied the phylogeography of metacrangonyx longipes chevreux,  <dig>  a euryhaline stygobiont amphipod crustacean that is endemic to mallorca and menorca . on mallorca, it occurs in various types of groundwater habitats, from coastal anchialine caves  of raised salinity to freshwater inland wells, caves and springs. on menorca, the species is restricted to coastal anchialine caves and wells and is absent from fresh inland groundwaters. on both islands, the species is limited to lowlands and is absent in apparently suitable habitats located at elevations higher than  <dig> m above sea level. the metacrangonyctidae is a strictly inland water subterranean family with no close relatives; however, several lines of evidence strongly suggest its marine origin:  its members are known only from continental regions that were covered by ancient epicontinental seas  <cit> ; and  several species still maintain ties with the marine environment .

in this study, we used the sequences of three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene of m. longipes and of several congeneric species to perform a phylogenetic analysis of the species and infer population divergence times. moreover, we use sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit  <dig> gene from a more comprehensive data set to perform a phylogeographic analysis and to examine the population structure of this taxon. given the manifested euryhalinity of m. longipes and the absence of any appreciable morphological differentiation between its populations on the two islands, our initial prediction was that the species could have dispersed across the groundwater environment of the islands using the virtually continuous peripheral coastal anchialine pathway, from which it could have colonized inland freshwater habitats recurrently. if this was the case, we could expect a pattern of considerable gene flow and shallow genetic divergences within each island, with genetic signatures of inland populations deriving from coastal ones. however, our study revealed that this amphipod displays a remarkably ancient and highly fragmented population structure, with episodes of cladogenesis that could be related to major sea-level changes that affected the islands during the last  <dig> ma.

RESULTS
four gene fragments-three mitochondrial , cytochrome b  and 16s rrna ) and one nuclear -with a total sequence length of about  <dig>  kb were sequenced from  <dig> metacrangonyx longipes specimens and the outgroups metacrangonyx ilvanus, m. remyi and m. sp . these mitochondrial sequences were assumed not to correspond to nuclear pseudogenes, as the mtdna protein-coding genes considered did not include stop codons or frameshift mutations and no double peaks appeared in the corresponding chromatograms. moreover, the separate analyses of each marker gave essentially congruent tree topologies, with partition bremer support  positive values for most of the tree nodes . few nodes with low support showed pbs values close to zero, suggesting that their low phylogenetic signal is not due to incongruence among markers. most of the variation is contained in the mitochondrial genes: cox <dig>  cob and rrnl had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> parsimony informative positions, respectively. histone h3a sequences rendered five haplotypes only, with six parsimony informative sites and two fixed substitutions in m. longipes with respect to the outgroup species.

phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances
bayesian and maximum likelihood  analyses of the combined mitochondrial and nuclear data set yielded a similar topology, in which five divergent monophyletic lineages of m. longipes not showing geographical overlap were clearly recognized . a clade comprising three anchialine caves from the s and se of mallorca  was highly supported and recovered as sister to the remaining clades after rooting the tree with congeneric species. the remaining populations formed four highly supported clades, although the evolutionary relationships among them remain unresolved: clade d ; two divergent mallorcan clades, one located on the west side  and the other on the north side of the island ; and clade b, comprising wells located far inland in the mallorcan central area. the latter cluster was, in turn, subdivided into two genetic groups  showing an approximate ne-sw geographical segregation. a more comprehensive data set comprising the cox <dig> gene fragment from  <dig> specimens was used in population analyses . bayesian and ml analyses performed on the cox <dig> data set resulted in phylogenetic trees that were compatible with those derived from the combined analyses mentioned above; however, ambiguous or non-supported relationships persisted among clades, such as the position of the menorcan populations with respect to their mallorcan counterparts. in addition, the relationship among mallorcan clades e and c was only weakly supported . parsimonious reconstructions of habitat type based on the cox <dig> or the total evidence mtdna phylogenetic analysis showed at least three transitions to fresh inland groundwaters from anchialine brackish habitats .

number of specimens of metacrangonyx longipes per collection site, cox <dig> mtdna haplotypes, haplotype and nucleotide diversities with corresponding standard deviations.

cox <dig> uncorrected distances between collection sites ranged from a minimum of  <dig> % between those located close to each other  to a maximum of  <dig> %  between populations from the two islands  or between some mallorcan populations. as deduced from the phylogenetic analyses, clade a was the most divergent , whereas the distance between the other clades fell between  <dig> - <dig> %. the distance between subclades b <dig> and b <dig> averaged  <dig> %.

population genetic structure and genetic diversity
fifty different cox <dig> haplotypes were identified in the sampled specimens from the  <dig> populations analysed  . four haplotypes were shared between neighbouring populations: haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig> in several central mallorcan localities , whereas haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig> were present in two sineu wells . table  <dig> summarizes the standard intra-population diversity estimated for cox <dig>  six populations included only one haplotype , although in three of them only two specimens  were analysed. in sharp contrast, three populations showed maximum diversity indices, as every individual bore a different haplotype . the rest of populations attained low-to-moderate h values, in the range of  <dig> - <dig> . diversity was much lower in the two menorcan populations  compared with the mallorcan populations . nucleotide diversity  were low at most locations ; population  <dig> alone exhibited a π value > 1% because of the presence of an individual bearing a divergent haplotype. neutrality tests were non-significant in all cases, with the exception of populations  <dig>  and  <dig> .

the mantel test revealed a moderately significant correlation  between genetic and geographic distances. in addition, cox <dig> pair-wise population fst values were generally high  and highly significant, with the exception of between neighbouring populations . accordingly, samova showed that the optimum number of population groups necessary to maximize fct values was k = 19- <dig> , whereas the corresponding fsc values were the lowest in the k series tested, as expected  <cit> . this structure grouped wells 10- <dig> and  <dig> into a single population, whereas wells at campanet  and pollença  on one side, and wells at vilafranca  and cala sant vicenç  on the other, formed three different populations. most sites harbouring the same population were less than  <dig> km apart, with the exception of sites  <dig> and  <dig>  which were separated by about  <dig> km. the remaining sites each represented a single, distinct population group, suggesting the occurrence of a high population subdivision with gene flow occurring exclusively among wells located less than  <dig> km apart. the occurrence of an alternative geographical structuring that yielded higher k values was explored using amova, as this method allows recognition of population groups with any number of k. this analysis yielded a similar geographical setting, but identified wells  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as different populations; amova showed that fct values reached a plateau at  <dig>  at k = 19- <dig>  with the highest value attained at k =  <dig> 

estimation of coalescence time
the coalescence of the mitochondrial sequences of m. longipes was estimated via bayesian analyses using the cox <dig> population data set and implementing a relaxed molecular clock with a substitution rate fixed at  <dig>  per year per lineage  <cit> , or the range  <dig> - <dig>  estimated elsewhere for crustaceans  <cit> . tree root ages fell between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma depending on the assumed rate, while other node ages were remarkably similar in both instances, although the crustacean mitochondrial rate range rendered slightly older estimates and broader confidence intervals . estimations using the yule model on the combined mitochondrial data set and a standard  <dig> % rate fell also in the same range . based on the coalescent model, divergence of the mallorcan clade b -comprising localities from the central area of the island- can be traced back at  <dig> - <dig>  ma, whereas that of clade e - occupying the n and ne of the island- seems to have occurred at  <dig> - <dig>  ma. in both cases, 95% highest posterior densities  fell within the range  <dig> - <dig>  ma . seemingly, the node corresponding to clade d  was dated at  <dig> - <dig>  ma, whereas that of clade a  was dated at  <dig> - <dig>  ma . nodes corresponding to the two mallorcan sister subclades b <dig> and b <dig> were dated at  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  ma, respectively . in contrast, the coalescence of monophyletic sequences from particular mallorcan caves or wells was much more recent, with estimates falling within  <dig> - <dig>  ma.

discussion
the thalassoid condition of metacrangonyx longipes is supported in our study as we can deduce at least three independent episodes of colonization of fresh inland groundwaters from primary anchialine, brackish water ancestors. m. longipes populations appeared split into five deep genetic lineages devoid of any relevant morphological differentiation. gene flow between populations did not exceed  <dig> km and was frequently limited to occur in a radius of less than  <dig> km. therefore, our results do not support an active colonization of fresh inland groundwater habitats by expansive crevicular/interstitial marine littoral ancestors   <cit> . if that was the case, we should have found evidence of substantial connectivity between the populations of m. longipes established far inland in completely fresh waters and those of the coastal anchialine medium, and among anchialine population themselves.

some of the m. longipes clades were linked to particular or neighbouring hydrographic catchments and were found nowhere else . thus, clade c was found exclusively at the torrent de sóller catchment, whereas clade b <dig> was restricted to the head-waters of torrent de muro  and to some vicine stations at the torrent de na borges catchment . likewise, clade b <dig>  was found only at the head-waters of three different catchments: torrent de na borges, son bauló and son real ; nevertheless, these three torrents became recurrently confluent and formed a single palaeodrainage system in past glacial periods with lower sea-level, when the shallow shelf between mallorca and menorca was completely exposed sub-aerially . these results suggest that quartering within and displacement along the hyporheic medium associated with these water-courses played a role in structuring the populations of the species. even limited dispersal across the watershed of adjacent catchments seems possible, as shown above: the plains where the watershed between torrent de muro and torrent de na borges is located harbours small, shallow perched aquifers that probably form a continuum in winter, when the area is soaked and attracts important numbers of waders and other waterbirds .

in a study on hyalid and crangonyctoid stygobiont amphipods from w australian calcrete aquifers, cooper et al.  <cit>  showed that the major mitochondrial cox <dig> lineages were restricted to a single isolated calcrete, whereas most of the genetic variation occurred between calcretes. although some populations from neighbouring calcretes placed in the same palaeodrainage channel are genetically similar , populations do not appear necessarily clustered according to palaeodrainage channel. this pattern could result from the occurrence of gene flow or range expansion between palaeodrainages in the past, before populations became isolated in particular calcretes. the ulterior isolation of populations could be associated with a major period of aridification that affected the region between  <dig> and  <dig> ma  <cit> .

major cladogenetic events in m. longipes can be related to the succession of past sea-level changes in the mediterranean . during the tortonian , mallorca and menorca were invaded by an epicontinental sea that reduced the former to a cluster of small islands roughly corresponding to its current uplands, whereas the southern half of menorca was probably completely submerged   <cit> . we assume that a single m. longipes population was then distributed along the entire continental shelf of the archipelago. this ancestral population overcame the phase of deposition of evaporites of the so-called "messinian salinity crisis", which was dated precisely at  <dig> - <dig>  ma  <cit>  and was coeval with a generalized marine regression episode that could have dried up the mediterranean completely at that epoch. this mega-regression was probably the ultimate cause of the split of the species into two major lineages: the former clade a, corresponding to the population that remained associated and followed the receded sea coastline towards the se; and the remaining clades, which were presumably derived from the portion of the population that followed the receded coastline towards the n . the age of the most recent common ancestor of clade a and its sister group  has been estimated in our analyses at ca.  <dig> - <dig>  ma using a relaxed molecular clock based on cox <dig> sequences and a coalescent model.

sometime between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma , the populations from menorca , the mallorcan central zone , n mallorca  and w mallorca  became separated. the corresponding cladogenetic events might be linked to a single major marine transgression-regression cycle, such as that triggered by the upper pliocene refulfilment of the depressed basins in the w mediterranean area. the upper pliocene transgression, which took place immediately after the salinity crisis, probably reached ca. + <dig> m above the current sea level in the balearic area  <cit> . this might have enabled the species to reach the current central zone of mallorca . more recently, our phylogeny shows that at the beginning of the late pliocene, clades b, d and e experienced further splits that were followed by a differentiation of populations, with major secondary bifurcations occurring between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma. the uncertainties and large stochastic errors associated with the molecular clock estimations preclude the correlation of the tree node ages with the datings of particular geological and climate transitional episodes. however, it is remarkable that the obtained tree topology is in agreement with the documented chronological succession of changes in the late pliocene to mid-pleistocene sea-level record in the north hemisphere  <cit> . we suggest that recent cladogenetic events in m. longipes can be linked to two major cooling events roughly dated back at  <dig>  to  <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that marine transgression-regression cycles  may have induced the repeated range expansion, contraction and fragmentation of populations of m. longipes, which appears currently split into several isolated and genetically divergent lineages adapted to a broad spectrum of salinity conditions. this scenario could explain the difficulty in resolving the phylogenetic relationships among different lineages of this amphipod, regardless of the method or sequence data set used: the rapid isolation and almost synchronous diversification of peripheral populations of the same ancestor in inland aquifers may have led to this situation. this hypothesis has been proposed to account for the distribution of particular anchialine and fresh groundwater taxa at various taxonomic levels and at larger geographical scales  <cit> . our study stressed the importance of changes in sea level as a cause of deep intra-specific genetic divergence in thalassoid subterranean amphipods, a pattern that was apparently not accompanied by remarkable morphological differentiation  <cit> .
