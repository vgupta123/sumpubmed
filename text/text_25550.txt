BACKGROUND
beer is a fermented beverage that is high in ethanol, carbon dioxide and flavorful yeast metabolites, contains hop-derived flavor and antimicrobial compounds, and is low in ph, oxygen, and residual nutrients  <cit> . this environment has selected for unique groups of bacteria specialized in growth in beer, including several species of lactic acid bacteria . overall, one of the key metabolic actions of lab is the reduction of pyruvate into lactate to regenerate nad+ by means of lactate dehydrogenase activity. depending on the beer type produced, lactate production may or may not be desired  <cit> . as most lab species tolerate high ethanol concentrations and a low ph, hop resistance is the major factor limiting their growth in beer  <cit> . hop-derived antimicrobial compounds, known as iso-alpha acids, cause permeability changes in the bacterial cell wall  <cit> , leakage of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent inhibition of respiration and protein, dna, and rna syntheses  <cit> , as well as changes in leucine uptake and proton ionophore activity  <cit> . additionally, iso-alpha acids alter the redox properties of the bacterial cell, causing oxidative stress  <cit> . accordingly, hop resistance is a multifactorial property that requires different mechanisms to counteract the action of iso-alpha acids. a well-known factor mediating hop resistance is the atp-binding cassette multidrug transporter, hora, which extrudes iso-alpha acids  <cit>  and is plasmid-encoded  <cit> .

lab species frequently encountered in the beer environment belong to the genera lactobacillus and pediococcus, which are both gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, chemo-organotrophic bacteria of the family lactobacillaceae of the firmicutes phylum. the species with the highest capacity to grow in beer are lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus damnosus  <cit> , although the ability of bacteria to grow in beer is a strain- rather than species-specific characteristic  <cit> . recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of l. brevis for overcoming stresses in beer by means of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  and proteomic analyses  <cit> . less is known about the adaptations of p. damnosus to the beer environment. so far, pediococcus claussenii atcc baa-344t originating from spoiled beer, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc  <dig> of plant origin, and p. pentosaceus ie- <dig> originating from a dairy effluent sample, are the only members of the genus pediococcus for which the genome has been sequenced completely  <cit> . however, draft genome sequences are available for several strains of pediococcus acidilactici, namely strain ma 18/5 m originating from animal food, strain dsm  <dig> isolated from barley, strain 7_ <dig> from a human fecal sample, and strain ngri 0510q, formerly known as pediococcus lolii  <cit> , isolated from ryegrass silage . in general, pediococcus species possess rather small genomes , encoding a broad repertoire of transporters for efficient carbon and nitrogen acquisition and reflecting a limited range of biosynthetic capabilities. this suggests both extensive gene loss as well as acquisitions via horizontal gene transfer during the evolution of pediococci within their habitats  <cit> . several strains possess plasmids containing genes regulating the fermentation of carbohydrates and encoding different types of resistances   <cit> .

the strain p. damnosus lmg  <dig> was isolated in  <dig> from a flemish acid beer, i.e. a sour  and ethanolic  beer at the end of its maturation phase. a microbial diversity analysis of this mature beer proved that this strain was present in high numbers and is therefore able to replicate in this environment . flemish acid beers are produced by a mixed-culture fermentation and represent culturally important products, for which microbial activities play critical roles in beer production and quality formation  <cit> . in the present study, the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> is presented and analysed to obtain insights into its genome-based metabolic features. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying its metabolic capabilities enabled detailed insights into the mechanisms of adaptation of this strain to the beer environment. furthermore, comparison of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> with other sequenced genomes of members of the genus pediococcus addressed the potentially unique properties of this strain and other strains adapted to the beer environment.

RESULTS
general architecture and annotation of the pediococcus damnosus lmg  <dig> draft genome
paired-end sequencing of the p. damnosus lmg  <dig> genomic dna yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads that were assembled into  <dig> contigs , consisting of  <dig> large  and  <dig> small  contigs. this genome hence represents an intermediate size among the lab  <cit> . an overview of the gc content and the length of the contigs is presented in additional file  <dig>  the gc content of the complete draft genome averaged  <dig>  mol%. a total of  <dig> contigs could be mapped onto the p. claussenii atcc baa-344t chromosomal dna and were ordered accordingly . two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  arrays were found on contigs  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas three crispr-associated coding sequences   were found on contig  <dig>  indicating that strain lmg  <dig> acquired resistance to a plasmid or phage infection. one intact prophage region  containing  <dig> cdss was predicted and identified as the lactobacillus phage sha <dig>  which was originally isolated from kimchi  <cit> . this phage has an isomeric head and a long tail and is classified as a member of the large family of siphoviridae. the genes of phage sha <dig> are organized into five functional clusters: replication/regulation/modification, packaging, structure/morphogenesis, lysis, and lysogeny. most of the phage-related cdss were found on contig  <dig>  which was predicted to be part of the chromosomal dna.table  <dig>

a blast search of the remaining non-chromosomally encoded contigs against a plasmid-specific database  revealed many similarities towards plasmids of different bacterial species . many of these contigs  were similar to the plasmids of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t, with the exception of plasmids ppecl- <dig> and ppecl- <dig>  onto which no contigs mapped. these two plasmids are small and cryptic , whereas the other six plasmids of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t range from  <dig> to 36 kb and contribute to roughly 7% of the strain’s coding capacity  <cit> . four, six, ten, four, eight, and three contigs mapped onto plasmids ppecl- <dig>  ppecl- <dig>  ppecl- <dig>  ppecl- <dig>  ppecl- <dig>  and ppecl- <dig> of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t, respectively. a total of  <dig> contigs did not show high similarities towards the plasmids of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t. contigs  <dig> and  <dig> were similar to plasmids pbm <dig> and wsh-002_p <dig> of bacillus megaterium strains qm b <dig> and wsh- <dig>  respectively, whereas others were similar to plasmids of l. brevis strains 925a, kb <dig>  and atcc  <dig> , lactobacillus plantarum wcfs <dig> , lactobacillus buchneri strains cd <dig> and nrrl b- <dig> , or other lactobacillus species . in addition, several cdss involved in plasmid replication were found, which encoded replication initiation proteins .

gene finding and annotation of the p. damnosus lmg  <dig> draft genome with the integrated microbial genomics expert review  software resulted in a total gene count of  <dig>  among which  <dig> % were cdss. a total of  <dig> % of the cdss could be assigned to a protein, among which  <dig> % and  <dig> % were predicted to be enzymes and transporters, respectively. this agrees with the property of lab to encode a broad repertoire of transporters for efficient nutrient uptake and reflects their limited biosynthetic capabilities  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> % of the genes encoded signal peptides, whereas  <dig> % encoded transmembrane proteins. furthermore, a total of  <dig> trna and three 5s, 16s, and 23s rrna genes were predicted. as expected, most cdss were involved in carbohydrate, protein, dna, and rna metabolism and in cell wall and capsule construction. these findings agreed with those of makarova and colleagues  <cit> , who analyzed  <dig> genomes belonging to the order lactobacillales and defined a core of lactobacillales-specific clusters of orthologous groups . the functional distribution of the conserved core of  <dig> lacogs showed that the majority encodes components of the information processing systems , which are likely to perform essential functions. with the exception of  <dig> lacogs , all core lacogs were found in the draft genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  genome closure could possibly lead to the identification of these missing core functions, although an update of the core lacogs is mandatory, because only  <dig> lactobacillales species out of more than  <dig> species of this order were included; in addition, only one of these  <dig> species belonged to the genus pediococcus.

next to these core functions, the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> comprised  <dig> predicted cdss that were associated with virulence, disease, and defense, including three multidrug resistance efflux pumps. also,  <dig> cdss related to stress response were detected, seven of which were involved in oxidative stress response. four of the non-core lacogs present in the p. damnosus lmg  <dig> draft genome comprised  <dig> or more cdss in a cog, namely arabinose efflux permeases , transcriptional regulators , predicted transcriptional regulators , and transposases and their inactivated derivatives . arabinose efflux permeases belong to the major facilitator superfamily, a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cdss of cog <dig> were annotated as arabinose efflux permeases and drug resistance transporters from the emrb/qaca subfamily, respectively. in addition, one cds was predicted to be a drug resistance transporter of the bcr/cfla subfamily and one was predicted to be a transporter belonging to the carbohydrate transporter family. the cog <dig> members belonged to the tetr family of transcriptional repressors, which are involved in transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, responses to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. analysis of the cdss of cog <dig> did not reveal insights into their function. finally, the cdss in cog <dig> were all transposases belonging to the insertion sequence is <dig> family. the presence of is elements may lead to genomic instability due to its role in gene loss and gene gain  <cit> .

comparative genomics
the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> was compared with the complete genome sequences of p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t. the number of cdss predicted in the draft genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> was higher compared to those in the reference genomes . in addition, the number of genes in p. claussenii atcc baa-344t exceeded that of p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig>  this could be explained by the need to acquire additional functions during evolution to be able to survive in the hostile beer environment compared to the plant environment. possibly, p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> can acquire more nutrients from its environment compared to p. damnosus lmg  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t. the number of rrna operons in the genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> was lower compared to that in p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t, which may reflect differences in ecological competitiveness  <cit> . in addition, the average nucleotide identities  of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> versus p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, whereas the anis between p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t were  <dig> %. these results agreed with previous findings, indicating that p. claussenii and p. pentosaceus are evolutionarily closer related to each other compared to p. damnosus  <cit> .table  <dig>

the predicted proteome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> was assigned into orthologous clusters, along with the proteomes of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t and p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> to predict unique and/or shared characteristics between these lab strains and species. a total of  <dig> putative orthologous proteins were shared between p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> , p. claussenii atcc baa-344t and p. damnosus lmg  <dig> , whereas  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> orthologs were unique to p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig>  p. claussenii atcc baa-344t, and p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  respectively . genes that are shared between p. damnosus lmg  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t, but not by p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig>  possibly promote survival in beer. for instance, the presence of genes involved in hop resistance, osmotic stress response, exopolysaccharide  production, and the presence or absence of complete or partial metabolic pathways may lead to the strain’s ability to grow in beer. furthermore, the functions enriched in the genomes of bacteria capable of growing in beer are likely to contribute to their specific phenotypic traits.figure  <dig>

genes involved in hop resistance
research on hop resistance genes have suggested that these genes are typically acquired via horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . although several putative hop resistance genes have been described, only the presence of hora definitively correlates with lab growth in beer, with the presence of hora together with hita and/or horc allowing fast bacterial growth. a recent transcriptome study of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t showed increased transcript levels of several genes during growth in beer compared to growth in mrs-b medium  <cit> . this was especially the case for genes encoded on plasmids ppecl- <dig>  ppecl- <dig>  and ppecl- <dig>  contrasting to ppecl- <dig> and ppecl- <dig>  many cdss on ppecl- <dig> showed strong homology towards contigs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the draft genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> . plasmid ppecl- <dig> harbored the previously mentioned hora gene, which is involved in hop resistance. furthermore, several orthologs of the p. claussenii atcc baa-344thora gene were found both in the draft genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  and in the complete genome of p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> , which all encoded abc-type multidrug transporters. in depth analysis of these cdss revealed that only ah70_ <dig> showed high  amino acid sequence homology towards the hora gene product of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t; the remaining cdss showed less than 70% homology. possibly, these hora orthologs are descendants of a common ancestor that evolved towards a different functionality, with the hora gene in p. claussenii atcc baa-344t and ah70_ <dig> in p. damnosus lmg  <dig> being specialized in the extrusion of iso-alpha acids.figure  <dig>

interestingly, several studies have revealed that the hora gene is consistently surrounded by the same set of genes in bacteria growing in beer, suggesting that these entire regions are acquired via horizontal gene transfer  <cit>  and could possibly play a role in their adaptation to the beer niche. most of these hora-surrounding genes are involved in phospholipid or cell wall biosynthesis. orthologs of pecl_ <dig>  pecl_ <dig>  and pecl_ <dig> flanking the hora gene were found in the genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  but not in the p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> genome sequence. ah70_ <dig> and ah70_ <dig> were annotated as an acyl-phosphate glycerol 3-phospate and a glycosyl transferase, respectively. both pecl_ <dig> and pecl_ <dig> are members of the lysophospholipid acyltransferase superfamily, which contains acyltransferases of de novo and remodeling pathways of glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. finally, ah70_ <dig> contained a family  <dig> glycosyl transferase domain that catalyzes the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds.

in addition to the hora gene, the hita gene encodes a divalent cation transporter and confers hop resistance by importing manganese and thereby counteracting proton gradient dissipation  <cit> . orthologs of the hita gene of l. brevis l <dig>  were found in the genomes of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> , p. claussenii atcc baa-344t , and p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> . the reason for the presence of the hita gene in p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> of plant origin remains unclear. furthermore, horc has been suggested to be a proton motive force-dependent multidrug transporter, whose gene expression is under control of the horb transcriptional regulator  <cit> . orthologs of the horc gene of lactobacillus backii lmg  <dig>  were found on contig  <dig>  in the p. damnosus lmg  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t genome sequences , but not in that of p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig>  finally, horb, bsra, and bsrb homologs were not found in the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  <cit> .

folate biosynthesis
the beer isolates p. damnosus lmg  <dig> and p. claussenii atcc baa-344t contained a set of genes involved in folate biosynthesis that were absent in the genome of p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> . these included a  <dig> -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase , a dihydropteroate synthase , a 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase , a gtp cyclohydrolase i type  <dig> , and a dihydroneopterin aldolase .

because folate-dependent formylation of the initiator trna is a hallmark of bacterial translation and because bacteria cannot import formylmethionyl-trna, folate is essential for bacterial growth  <cit> . most bacteria make folate de novo, starting from gtp and chorismate  <cit> . the first enzyme in de novo folate biosynthesis is gtp cyclohydrolase i that catalyzes a complex reaction, in which the five-membered imidazole ring of gtp is opened and a six-membered dihydropyrazine ring is formed . the resulting  <dig> -dihydroneopterin triphosphate is then converted into the corresponding monophosphate by a specific pyrophosphatase. a pyrophosphatase was found in the genome of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t but was absent in the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  blastp of the pyrophosphatase gene against the predicted cds amino acid sequences of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> did not reveal the presence of a homologous gene. possibly, the gene performing this function in p. damnosus lmg  <dig> has not been previously identified or is missing due to non-orthologous gene replacement. alternatively, some missing information in the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> may account for this gap in the folate biosynthesis pathway. dihydroneopterin aldolase subsequently releases glycoaldehyde to produce 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin, which is then pyrophosphorylated by hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase. 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin pyrophosphate and 4-aminobenzoic acid moieties are condensed by dihydropteroate synthase and this results in the production of dihydropteroate. the enzymes involved in the conversion of dihydropteroate into tetrahydrofolate-polyglutamate are shared by the three genomes analyzed. these similarities and differences in folate biosynthesis potential between the p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  p. claussenii atcc baa-344t, and p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> genomes may be explained by the environmental acquisition of folate by the latter strain. plants produce folate de novo, so possibly p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> harbors folate transporters to import folate produced by its host and lost genes involved in folate biosynthesis during evolution.figure  <dig>

exopolysaccharide production
laboratory experiments indicated that p. damnosus lmg  <dig> produces eps. the ability of a strain to produce eps is not directly correlated to its ability to reside in beer but probably has importance in biofilm formation  <cit> , thereby enabling persistence in the brewery environment. the eps produced by p. claussenii atcc baa-344t is a high-molecular-mass β-glucan produced by the action of a transmembrane glycosyl transferase  gene. this gene is located on plasmid ppecl- <dig>  which is not essential for growth in beer  <cit> . the fibrillar polymer consists of a trisaccharide repeating unit with a β- <dig> -linked glucose backbone and branches made up of single β- <dig> -linked d-glucopyranosyl residues. walling and colleagues  <cit>  reported a glucosyl transferase gene  in p. damnosus ioeb <dig>  originating from wine, that produces a linear backbone of 3-β-d-glucose- <dig> moieties. surprisingly, no homologies towards the gtf and dps genes were found in the draft genome sequence of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  yet, contig  <dig> harbored a cds , containing a glycosyl transferase  domain, which may be involved in eps production. orthomcl analysis indicated that this cds was unique to p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  other cds candidates involved in eps production by p. damnosus lmg  <dig> were ah70_ <dig>  ah70_ <dig>  and ah70_ <dig>  which were all predicted to be present on contig  <dig>  these proteins did not show amino acid sequence homologies of more than 70% towards the proteomes of p. claussenii atcc baa-344t and p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig>  ah70_ <dig> is an eps biosynthesis protein, consisting of an aaa domain containing a p-loop, and showed similarities towards the capsular eps family protein  found in the genome of lactobacillus kisonensis f <dig>  originating from the human oral cavity  <cit> . ah70_ <dig> is a lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis domain that is involved in the biosynthesis of eps. this protein showed more than 70% protein sequence homology towards the chain length determinant protein  of l. buchneri atcc  <dig>  isolated from the human oral cavity  <cit> . finally, ah70_ <dig> harbored a cell envelope-related transcriptional attenuator domain, which describes a domain of unknown function that is found in the predicted extracellular domain of a number of putative membrane-bound proteins  <cit> . one of those is cpsa, a putative regulatory protein involved in eps biosynthesis  <cit> . ah70_ <dig> showed more than 70% protein sequence homology towards a cell envelope-like function transcriptional attenuator common domain protein  of l. buchneri atcc  <dig> and a biofilm regulatory protein of l. kisonensis f <dig> . besides the presence of proteins potentially involved in eps production in p. damnosus lmg  <dig> , the mechanism of eps production in p. damnosus lmg  <dig> remains unclear.

genes involved in oxidative stress response
pittet and coworkers  <cit>  found a set of highly transcribed genes in p. claussenii atcc baa-344t during growth in beer as a response to the oxidative stress imposed by hops. these genes are manganese transport proteins, methionine sulfoxide reductases msra and msrb as well as other metal transport and homeostasis proteins. orthologs of these genes were found in the genomes of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> and p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig>  indicating that the presence of these genes is not unique to strains capable of growing in beer. these results indicate that growth in beer is a multifactorial reaction of the cell towards a challenging environment, not only involving the presence of specific genes but also the up-and down-regulation of specific sets of genes.

cogs enriched in the genomes of bacteria originating from beer
next to cogs unique to bacteria originating from beer, enriched cogs could also provide insight into the mechanisms of niche adaptation. the four most abundant non-core lacogs  in the p. damnosus lmg  <dig> draft genome were also present in the p. claussenii atcc baa-344t and p. pentosaceus atcc  <dig> genomes, but were enriched only in the genomes of the bacterial strains originating from beer  . other enriched functions were cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . the enrichment of the above-mentioned functions in bacteria growing in beer was further substantiated when analyzing additional genome sequences of the genus pediococcus and lactobacillus. many cogs that were enriched in bacteria originating from beer are involved in transcriptional regulation, indicating that genes can be up- or down-regulated in hop-stressed cells. currently, it is not clear in which processes these regulators are involved but this may be revealed by transcriptome analyses.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
the draft genome of p. damnosus lmg  <dig> and its comparative analysis with the genomes of other pediococci provided insights into the adaptation of this strain to the beer environment. these adaptations included the presence of the hora gene and its surrounding genes, genes involved in de novo folate biosynthesis, genes involved in the production of eps, and the enrichment of functions related to transcriptional regulation. furthermore, the results presented in this study will enable future transcriptome analysis of p. damnosus lmg  <dig>  which can provide additional insights into its metabolic activities.
