BACKGROUND
together with single nucleotide polymorphisms , dna structural variations generally termed copy number variations  are the major part of genomic variations in diverse animals including dogs  <cit> . cnvs are thought to contribute to phenotypic diversities including disease susceptibility and provide the important substrate for evolution  <cit> . although it has been widely believed that all the cells in one individual are genetically identical, this dogma is changing due to our understanding of genomic variants. indeed, recent studies have demonstrated the somatic mosaicism of cnvs in body organs  <cit> , which suggests that de novo cnv events may commonly occur during mitotic recombination  <cit> . this possibility was clearly demonstrated by bruder et al’s report identifying de novo somatic cnv events in monozygotic  twins  <cit> . they showed that the de novo post-twinning cnv frequency could be as high as 5% on a per-individual basis or 10% per twinning event. also, breckpot et al. reported cnvs in  <dig> out of  <dig> phenotypically discordant mz twins  <cit> . these results suggest that cnv analysis in phenotypically discordant mz twins can be useful to identify genetic loci associated with various traits. however, the de novo rate of somatic cnv mosaicism events is still largely unknown. for the case of cloned dogs, there has been no report about the de novo somatic cnv mosaicism event itself.

dogs  have been used as working animals due to their superior sniffing ability to any other species or machine. for example, a cancer-sniffing dog can detect the existence of colorectal cancer from stool samples with 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity  <cit> . however, up to 70% of dogs that were bred from working dogs are not suitable for practical use because they lack trainability  <cit> . to reduce the tremendous cost, effort, and time to train one working dog, dog-cloning technology has been applied for the propagation of elite working dogs  <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to identify de novo somatic cnv events which may exist in cloned dogs with identical genetic backgrounds like in human mz twins using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization . array-cgh is one of the most popular and useful tools to analyze genome-wide cnv profiles and a number of studies have identified canine cnvs using this technique  <cit> . we validated the cnvs by diverse analyses such as genomic qpcr, dye-swap array-cgh, and b-allele profile analysis. we examined the genome-wide de novo somatic cnv events for the seven cloned dogs generated in our previous study  <cit>  and identified five de novo cnv events.

RESULTS
validation of custom canine-array
we designed a custom array containing an average probe spacing of  <dig>  kb across the whole canine genome for cnv screening. before analyzing potential cnvs among the seven cloned dogs, we first validated whether this custom array platform could reliably detect cnvs between different canine breeds. for this, we screened cnvs between the nuclear donor, a labrador retriever genome , and a boxer genome as reference  using array-cgh, and verify the cnvs by genomic qpcr. under our cnv detection criteria, we identified  <dig> cnvs between the labrador retriever and boxer across diverse chromosomes spanning  <dig> %  of the canine genome. the average cnv size was  <dig> kb . figure 1a illustrates the whole-genome plot of copy number gain- and loss-cnvs  identified with our array. details of the  <dig> cnvs are available in additional file 1: table s <dig>  when we compared the  <dig> cnvs with previously identified dog cnv regions  <cit> ,  <dig> %  identified in this study overlapped with the previously reported canine cnvs, while seven  were novel. statistical significance of enriched cnv overlap with known dog cnv data was evaluated by permutation test as described previously  <cit> . the overlap with known dog cnv data was significantly not a random event . to validate our array platform and our cnv defining criteria through genomic qpcr, we randomly selected nine cnv loci  out of the  <dig> cnvs and designed eleven primer sets targeting the nine loci. all the eleven qpcrs in the nine cnv loci showed consistent copy number changes that matched the array results . we also validated the seven novel cnvs. the average size of the novel cnvs was  <dig>  kb  and all of them were consistently validated by genomic qpcr . since one of the  <dig> novel cnvs  was included in the nine validation targets, a total of  <dig> cnvs were qpcr validated in this study. all these data supported the reliability of our customized array platform and the subsequent analyses for identifying canine cnvs, therefore we applied this system to analyze cloned dog genomes.

association with segmental duplications and repetitive sequences
to understand the mechanism of cnv formation, we assessed the association of cnvs with segmental duplications  and repetitive sequences. when we compared the  <dig> cnvs with the cnv data from nicholas et al’s report, which systematically analyzed sds and associated cnvs in canis familiaris  <cit> ,  <dig>  overlapped with the sds. total length of the overlapped cnvs was about 6 mb . this result was coherent with nicholas et al’s previous report demonstrating that 70% of cnvs were associated with sds  <cit> . considering that sds are often substrates of cnv formation via non allelelic homologous recombination   <cit> , ours and previous results suggest that sd-associated nahr might be the major mechanism of canine cnv generation. when we observed the genomic fraction  of long interspersed elements , short interspersed elements  and long terminal repeats  within  or in the vicinity of the cnvs , line elements were relatively enriched the flanking regions , while relatively depleted lines/sines in intracnv . this result is coherent with the previous reports suggesting that repeated sequences may play a role in the formation of structural variation and genomic diversity  <cit> .

de novo cnvs identified in the cloned dogs
to verify the genetic homogeneity between the donor dog and clones, we first performed the microsatellite-based evaluation of the individual identity. being consistent with our previous report  <cit> , all seven cloned dogs showed identical microsatellite patterns with the donor at all nine microsatellite markers examined . we calculated the probability that the clone should have the same genotype as the donor under two different assumptions: assuming hardy–weinberg equilibrium, and assuming that both individuals are siblings as described previously  <cit> . the probabilities of exact allele matching at the nine microsatellite markers in a population of labrador retriever  suggest that allele matching at all nine microsatellite loci is not a random event. we next performed genome-wide array-cgh-based cnv screening to identify de novo cnvs in cloned dogs. for this, genomic dna from the nuclear donor dog was used as the universal reference for each array-cgh. therefore, all the cnvs identified can be interpreted as de novo ones. under the same cnv detection criteria as in the validation experiment, we identified five de novo cnvs in two of the seven cloned dogs ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  mb . among the five de novo cnvs, a  <dig> kb-sized cnv on chromosome  <dig>  did not overlap with the previously reported canine cnvs, while the other four  overlapped with those reported . the overlap with known dog cnv data was significantly not a random event . figure 2a is the genome-wide signal intensity plot  in cloned dog- <dig>  as an example. to validate the de novo cnvs, we first carried out dye-swap array-cgh analysis for the clone- <dig> genome, but not for the clone- <dig> genome due to the lack of genomic dna. dye swap is a repeating hybridization on two-dye microarrays with the same samples but with swapped fluorescent labels. if there is true copy number change, the test/reference intensity ratio value must be inverted by the switching of the dyes. the concordant copy number changes detected in dye-swap analysis were considered to be true changes. as expected, all four cnvs identified in clone- <dig> consistently showed flipped signal intensity plots in the dye-swap hybridization , supporting the accuracy of the cnvs identified by array-cgh.

b-allele profile of the de novo cnvs
in addition to the dye-swap analysis, we also performed whole-genome snp genotyping for the genomes of the donor and cloned dogs using an illumina caninehd 170 k snp array to obtain a more reliable interpretation of the de novo cnvs. a  <dig>  mb-sized region of copy number gain on chromosome x identified by array-cgh in clone- <dig> clearly showed two heterozygous clusters of snps in the b-allele plot, while no copy number gains or heterozygous clusters of snps were detected in the donor genome . the  <dig> kb-sized copy number gain on chromosome  <dig> of clone- <dig> also showed two heterozygous clusters of snps in the b-allele plot that were not detected in the donor genome . the other three cnvs on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were too small to be interpreted by b-allele pattern .

in addition to the de novo cnvs, we identified a copy neutral de novo loss of heterozygosity  event on chromosome  <dig> by the b-allele pattern analysis. this 37 mb-sized loh was identified in the distal end of chromosome  <dig> in clone- <dig>  but not in the nuclear donor nor in the other cloned dogs .

genomic qpcr validation of the de novo cnvs
to validate the existence and boundaries of the cnvs, we performed genomic qpcr for multiple points within and outside the expected cnv breakpoints. for this, we designed two to seven target specific primer pairs for each cnv . through multiple-point genomic qpcr, four of the five cnvs were consistently validated, while the other one relatively smaller sized cnv was not validated . in the  <dig>  mb-sized region of copy number gain on chromosome x and the  <dig> kb-sized gain on chromosome  <dig> in clone- <dig>  all the qpcrs within the cnv regions consistently showed copy number gains and the qpcrs outside cnv region showed diploid copy numbers, which confirmed the accuracy of our array-cgh analysis in defining boundaries . likewise, all the other cloned dogs containing no cnvs were diploid at all qpcr points. of the relatively smaller-sized cnvs, a  <dig> kb copy number loss on chromosome  <dig> in clone- <dig> and  <dig> kb gain on chromosome  <dig> in clone- <dig> were successfully validated and their boundaries were estimated by qpcr . however, the  <dig> kb-sized cnv-g on chromosome  <dig> in clone- <dig> was not validated by genomic qpcr .

discussion
in this study, we aimed to identify de novo post-cloning cnv events which may exist in cloned dogs like in human mz twins. for this purpose, we designed a 720 k custom array by merging the nimblegen 385 k dog array as a backbone and 335 k probes for known canine cnv regions  <cit> . using this platform, we identified five de novo cnvs in two of the seven cloned dogs from the same nuclear donor. our findings support the occurrence of de novo post-cloning cnv events in mammals including dogs. although de novo cnv events in phenotypically concordant mz twins have been reported in humans  <cit> , to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of de novo cnvs in cloned animals including dogs generated by scnt technology.

as mentioned above, the de novo cnvs were unevenly identified across the dog clones ; four cnvs were identified in one clone  and one was in another clone . our result is similar with the previous reports observing the cnvs in human mz twins. breckpot et al. identified cnvs in  <dig> out of  <dig> phenotypically discordant mz twins  <cit> . in ehli et al’s report with  <dig> concordant and discordant mz twins,  <dig> de novo post-twining cnvs were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> twin pairs  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out the possibility of existence of more de novo cnvs because the array platform and defining algorithm we used in this study cannot be perfect. also, it is possible that some genetic events may have happened in the clone- <dig> harboring  <dig> cnvs during its development or scnt procedure. further cnv studies with a larger number of cloned dogs will be required to understand this phenomenon.

when we screened cnvs between the donor labrador retriever and a boxer to validate the performance of our custom array, the number of cnvs was largely similar to the report by nicholas et al. that compared cnvs using a  <dig>  m array between nine breeds of modern domestic dogs including labrador retriever  <cit> . most of the cnvs  identified in our validation experiment overlapped with the previously reported cnvs  <cit> , and the overlap was significantly not random event . all the nine randomly selected cnv loci and seven novel cnvs identified by array-cgh showed consistent copy number changes that were validated by qpcr. these results suggest the reliability of our custom array and cnv defining procedure. although exploring the novel canine cnvs is not our aim in this study, this result suggests that a substantial number of canine cnvs that have yet to be identified.

to validate the five de novo cnvs in the cloned dogs, we performed three different verification experiments; genomic qpcr, dye-swap array-cgh analysis and b-allele profile analysis. two larger de novo cnvs  on chromosomes x and  <dig> in clone- <dig> were consistently validated by all three experiments. the other three cnvs on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  seem to be too small to be interpreted by b-allele pattern . according to the technical note about cnv analysis algorithm for illumina humanhap240s array, which has a higher snp density than the array used in this study , the minimum recommended window size for loh score algorithm is  <dig> kb  <cit> . of the three smaller-sized cnvs, two  were verified by qpcr, but the cnv on the distal end of chromosome  <dig> was not verified. however, the cnv region on chromosome  <dig> was validated in dye-swap analysis, which suggests that the  <dig> kb-sized cnv region on chromosome  <dig> might be real.

there are several genes in the  <dig>  mb-sized copy number gain cnv locus including the neuroligin  <dig> x-linked , steroid sulfatase isozyme s , and odorant-binding protein  genes. in human, genetic variants of the nlgn4x gene have been reported to be associated with autism spectrum disorder in japanese and han chinese populations  <cit> . a cnv of the sts gene  has also been reported to be associated with intellectual disability in human  <cit> . obp is small soluble carrier protein that belongs to the family of lipocalins and that may be involved in the perception of pheromones  <cit> . however, we did not observe any differences regarding the phenotypes related to these genes in the cloned dogs harboring the de novo cnvs in this study.

in addition to the de novo cnvs, we also detected a copy neutral de novo loh event on chromosome  <dig>  this 37 mb-sized loh event occurred in a cloned dog but was not present in the nuclear donor dog, indicating that the uniparental disomy  arose from a mitotic event in the cloned dog. it is well known that upd is a genetic event associated with human diseases and mosaicism of aneuploidy can be associated with upd  <cit> . our results suggest that scnt could result in upd-related phenotypic differences among clones.

there are several limitations in this study. first, since the sample size of this study is very small, the scope of our analysis could not go beyond describing de novo cnvs. second, even though we identified de novo cnvs in cloned dogs, we could not analyze any association between the cnvs and phenotypic characteristics, because there have been no phenotypic differences among them so far. to overcome both limitations and draw biologically meaningful conclusions, we need to clone more dogs and to carefully observe the phenotypes of them, and apply more informative technologies such as whole genome sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified de novo cnv and loh events in cloned dogs generated from one nuclear donor. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of de novo cnvs in cloned animals including dogs generated by scnt technology. since cloned animals share almost identical genetic background like mz twins, to study their de novo genetic events can help understand formation mechanisms of genetic variants and their biological implications. also, our results can be a useful tool to study the genetic basis of diverse disease/phenotype traits in dogs.
