BACKGROUND
numerous checkpoints ensure the correct progression along the phases  of the eukaryotic cell cycle  <cit> . dna damage response pathways activate checkpoints to arrest the cell cycle transiently, promoting dna repair, or permanently, inducing senescence or cell death  <cit> . dna damage consists of dna single-strand breaks  and double-strand breaks  that present a threat to structural chromosome stability and are thus the main inducers of dna damage response  <cit> . this response to specific dna damage is an evolutionary program that prevents the propagation of incorrect genomic information. mammalian senescence, a less understood complex phenotype, is associated to aging and tumorigenesis  <cit> . the secretory phenotype associated with the senescent state includes growth factors that affect cells and tissues by activating membrane receptors whose deregulation is responsible for numerous pathologies, including cancer  <cit> .

upon dna damage, the mechanisms driving the decision between these different cell fates are still unclear and, partly due to a manifest medical impact, they are the subject of high interest . in particular, how cells are induced to senescence upon dna damage attracted a lot of attention, this phenotype being associated to tumour suppression  <cit> . here, we propose to resort to a qualitative modelling approach to investigate these mechanisms.

a variety of modelling frameworks offer complementary tools to integrate current knowledge in the form of computational models that provide insights into biological processes . recently, several groups have approached cell fate decision from different modelling perspectives, from differential equations to discrete models.

among other components, the tumour suppressor p <dig> protein triggers cellular programs that lead to different fates: transient arrest followed by cell cycle re-entry upon damage repair, permanent cell cycle arrest  or, if the damage is irreparable, initiation of cell death program . to investigate the decision between g <dig> arrest and apoptosis, zhang et al. proposed a modular model of the p <dig> network, using ordinary differential equations  <cit> . the model defined by iwamoto et al. also comprises p <dig> together with cell cycle regulation allowing to investigate the impact of dna damage intensities on cell cycle progression  <cit> . purvis and co-workers proposed a model based on delayed differential equations to further study how p <dig> dynamics influences the decision between apoptosis and senescence  <cit> .

in contrast to these continuous models, discrete, logical formalisms were used to tackle the study of networks implicated in cell cycle control  as well as in cell fate decision  <cit> . calzone et al.  <cit>  advanced with a model of cell fate decision with death and survival receptors as input signals, downstream pathways and three cellular outcomes: survival, apoptosis and necrosis. also relying on a logical approach, poltz and naumann devised a model to study the inflammation contribution to dna damage response leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis  <cit> . finally, the recent model from grieco et al. accounts for the influence of the stress responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway  on cancer cell fate decision  <cit> .

searching the literature and partly building on the network of human g1/s checkpoint activation  <cit> , we propose a logical model of cell fate decision upon dna damage, including proliferation, transient arrest for dna repair, apoptosis and, notably, senescence. this precursory model extends the regulatory pathway of g1/s checkpoint activation with the inclusion of the stress responsive protein p38mapk  that plays an important role in senescence  <cit> .

the paper is organised as follows. after a brief overview of main biological facts, our model is defined and analysed in the results section. the conclusion section is devoted to further discussion of the model properties and includes future work. the logical modelling framework is described in the methods section.

RESULTS
we briefly describe biological facts at the core of the regulatory network of figure  <dig>  the corresponding logical model being then thoroughly defined. this section ends with the model analysis, in terms of cell fates for the wild type situation and a range of perturbations.

in what follows, we first introduce well-established molecular processes responsible for g1/s checkpoint and apoptosis activation. then, as the main novelty of our work, we describe additional players involved in regulating human cellular senescence through g1/s checkpoint activation.

g1/s checkpoint and apoptosis 
presence of dna damage activates checkpoints, halting progression of the cell cycle  <cit> . arrest for repair, apoptosis or senescence can be triggered both at g1/s and g2/m checkpoints. in the case of senescence-induced dna damage, it was suggested that g1/s checkpoint is more sensitive and that a single dsb can induce arrest, while a larger number is required to activate g2/m checkpoint  <cit> . molecular machineries sense dna strand breaks and activate the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated  and rad3-related  and consequently downstream pathways involving the activation of p <dig>  <cit> . atm is activated by dsb while atr is activated by either ssb or dsb, and they both trigger a cascade of phosphorylations accounting for most of the interactions represented in figure  <dig> <cit> . atm phosphorylates the kinases checkpoint kinase  <dig>  while atr phosphorylates the kinases checkpoint kinase  <dig> . chek <dig> and chek <dig> initiate the cell cycle arrest by phosphorylating cell division cycle 25a protein  that prevents the dephosphorylation of the protein complexes cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>   <dig> and cyclin d  and cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> and cyclin e . this also prevents the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma  <dig> protein  and the release of e2f transcription factors that induce the expression of genes required for the cell to enter s phase  <cit> . atr, atm, chek <dig> and chek <dig> phosphorylate p <dig> that mediates the maintenance of g1/s arrest through the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a , which in turns inhibits cdk4/6-cyclin-d and cdk2/cyclin-e  <cit> . upon dna repair, the complex cdk2/cyclin-e is activated and drives the cell from g <dig> to s phase.

decision between growth arrest and apoptosis is mediated through a pivotal threshold mechanism related to the activation level of p <dig> that, when surpassed, triggers apoptosis at g1/s checkpoint  <cit> . the locus cdkn2a contributes to cell cycle regulation through its two products: p14arf , which promotes p <dig> and p16ink4a involved in senescence   <cit> . the regulatory module involving e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase homolog  and p14arf tightly controls p53; mdm <dig> promotes p <dig> degradation, while mdm <dig> is sequestered by p14arf to decrease p <dig> degradation  <cit> . in our model, apoptosis is oversimplified; it is activated when p <dig> reaches its highest level.

senescence 
the regulation of the senescent state, although less understood, is known to be associated with the activation in several cell types of the p53-p <dig> pathway  and of the p16ink4a-rb <dig> pathway  <cit> .

cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a  contributes along with p <dig> to block cancer progression since it inhibits the complex cdk4/6-cyclin-d required for proliferation. the overexpression of p16ink4a can induce a senescent arrest in several human cell types  <cit> . the exact mechanisms of regulation of p16ink4a  are still unclear, however p38mapk is involved somehow  <cit> .

p38mapk is a component of the atm/atr dependent mapk stress responsive pathway. besides regulating the locus cdkn2a, p38mapk activates p <dig> leading to arrest or apoptosis and inhibits cdc25a required for proliferation  <cit> . overexpression of p38mapk induces senescence even in the absence of dna damage  <cit> .

logical model
relying on the aforementioned biological evidences, and focusing on the inclusion of senescence as an additional outcome of the checkpoint arrest, we delineate a logical version of the regulation of the g1/s checkpoint. a description of the modelling framework is provided in the methods section.

the network of figure  <dig> should be seen as a generic wiring since senescence requires the involvement of both p16ink4a-rb <dig> and p53-p <dig> pathways in several cell types  <cit> . table  <dig> includes a brief documentation of the network nodes. the logical rules governing the states of the nodes briefly described below are given in table  <dig> 

input components  are constant and thus do not appear in this table. rules are defined using the logical connectors and, or and not. for each node, they specify its target value, depending on the state of its regulators. note that  <dig> is the default value .

ssb and dsb, the two input nodes of the network, take three values corresponding to damage intensities:  <dig> for no damage,  <dig> for a reparable damage and  <dig> for an irreparable damage. ssb and dsb levels determine the atr and atm levels, respectively, which in turn activate chek <dig>  chek <dig>  p38mapk and p <dig> 

the criterion for the activation of the 'proliferation' node  is the activation of cdk2cyce. the 'cycle_arrest' node, denoting a transient arrest for repair, is on in the absence of cdk2cyce.

components p <dig> and p38mapk have  <dig> and  <dig> levels, respectively, and play a central role in the network processing. the presence of intermediary dna damage induces p <dig> to its intermediary level  that is involved in several fates. to trigger apoptosis, p <dig> must reach its highest value   <cit> . in the model, this only occurs in case of fully irreparable dna damage: dsb=ssb =  <dig> 

p38mapk affects cell fate decision through its interactions with p <dig>  p16ink4a and p14arf. atm has a stronger positive influence on p38mapk than atr  <cit> . its first positive level  is reached when atr is present or when atm is present but not at its highest level. p38mapk is at level  <dig> when atm is at its maximum level but not atr. when both atm and atr are at their maximum levels, i.e. in the case of fully irreparable dna damage, p38mapk reaches its highest level .

as previously mentioned, 'senescence' is regulated simultaneously by the p53-p <dig> and p16ink4a-rb <dig> pathways and corresponds to a permanent arrest where proteins involved in cell cycle progression are inhibited, especially cdc25a. therefore, we consider that the activation of the fate 'senescence' requires both positive influences from p <dig> and p16ink4a, the absence of cdc25a and p <dig> not at its highest level. however, in the presence of cdc25a, senescence is activated provided p16ink4a is at its highest level  <dig>  such a p16ink4a significant overexpression, has been experimentally observed  <cit> . it was suggested that chek <dig> and chek <dig> may not have redundant roles in cdc25a regulation  <cit> . accordingly, cdc25a has  <dig> levels; its 'full' inactivation being achieved only in the presence of chek <dig>  chek <dig> and p38mapk. in what follows, we analyse the model outcomes, given by its stable states, for the wild-type situation and a range of relevant perturbations.

model stable states: wild type case
the node 'senescence' is activated when dsb =  <dig> and ssb< <dig> as irreparable ssb does not induce senescence  <cit> . when activated, 'senescence' is accompanied by 'cycle_arrest'. for ssb=dsb =  <dig>  'apoptosis' is activated by the high level of p <dig> .

summarising, the stable states of our model, in the wild type situation, are consistent: no damage leads to proliferation, high levels of dsb and ssb cause apoptosis, and all other combinations of levels of dsb or ssb induce senescence or transient cycle arrest.

model stable states: mutant cases
we briefly present the results obtained for a series of in silico perturbations that correspond to loss-of-function  or gain-of-function  experiments. the full set of stable states of each perturbation is listed in the supplementary material  <dig> to this article. table  <dig> recapitulates the comparisons between the model outcomes and experimental data for mutant cells that have undergone  dna damage. in these experiments, dna damage agents include ionizing radiation or carcinogenic chemicals. we searched for experiments preferentially dealing with human cells, but some mutations were found only in mice. additionally, when data at the cellular level are lacking, we sometimes refer to the mutant mice phenotype.

distinction is made between experiments that include dna damage or not . question marks indicate cases for which no data were found.

it is worth recalling that with cell culture experiments that are currently available, one cannot know in which checkpoint  the decision is taken. furthermore, results only provide the predominant fate among cell populations. still, our comparisons between experimental observations and the behaviour of our cellular model are qualitatively valid in terms of trend with regard to cell fate. moreover, we include some predictions of the model that remain to be experimentally tested.

p38mapk knockout decreases apoptosis in mouse fibroblasts  <cit>  whereas its gain-of-function induces senescence in human fibroblasts  <cit> . our model outcomes are compatible with these observations.

chek <dig> loss-of-function simulation abrogates senescence, similar to what is seen in thymocytes  <cit> . furthermore, the model predicts that when ssb =  <dig>  senescence is induced, as observed in experiments  <cit> . chek <dig> gain-of-function expression abrogates proliferation, also in agreement with experiments where apoptosis and senescence are enhanced in human dld <dig> and hela cells  <cit> . experiments of atm knockout report a decrease of apoptosis in human endothelial cells   <cit>  while our model abrogates it.

in our model, chek <dig> loss-of-function abrogates senescence, in contrast with experiments that show an increase of apoptosis  <cit> . however, this discrepancy is to be expected since, beyond the difficulty of comparing such experimental data with our model, chek <dig> is an essential gene involved in other important functions, including the homologous recombination repair and the regulation of g2/m checkpoint, both not included in our model  <cit> .

gain-of-function experiments of p14arf induce an apoptotic phenotype in osteosarcoma cells  <cit> . accordingly, our model predicts an enhanced apoptosis in the presence of dna damage, whereas in the absence of damage, proliferation is preserved.

in single cells and mutant mice, mdm <dig> knockout induces an apoptotic phenotype  <cit> , which is obtained by our model in the presence of dna damage. importantly, consistent with the experimental literature, the model shows that lethality of mdm <dig> knockout can be rescued by deleting p <dig>  <cit> . finally, in agreement with our model, ectopic expression of mdm <dig> abrogates apoptosis in mice cells  <cit> .

in the case of p16ink4a loss-of-function, there is no stable senescent state, as observed experimentally in several cell types, in which, in absence as well as in presence of dna damage, p16ink4a gain-of-function induces arrest and senescence enhancement  <cit> . gain-of-function of p16ink4a  displays multi-stability in the absence of dna damage, with two possible fates . by sampling the state space through  <dig> random simulations , we obtained that the probability of cycle arrest is > <dig> . the model thus reproduces the proliferation decrease, but senescence enhancement is only obtained in the presence of dna damage, with p16ink4a maintained constant at level  <dig> 

in agreement with the model outcomes, p <dig> loss-of-function induces proliferation in cancer cell lines, while its ectopic expression abrogates proliferation or induces senescence in human cells and mouse fibroblasts  <cit> .

p <dig> knockout induces proliferation and abrogates senescence in some cell types  <cit> , which is consistent with the model outcomes. additionally, p <dig> null mice cells show enhanced proliferation and are tumour prone  <cit> . p <dig> gain-of-function in mice cells induces an apoptotic phenotype  <cit> , an outcome also obtained with our model.

experiments of atr gain-of-function report an increase in senescence in mouse fibroblasts  <cit> , compatible with our model predictions.

in mice fibroblasts, cdc25a loss-of-function and gain-of-function respectively induce or prevent checkpoint arrest  <cit> . accordingly, for cdc25a loss-of-function, the model predicts loss of proliferation in the absence of dna damage. interestingly, in the presence of dna damage, the model predicts senescence enhancement for cdc25a loss-of-function, an outcome previously hypothesized  <cit> .

tissues of rb <dig> null mice show increased apoptosis while rb <dig> gain-of-function decreases proliferation  <cit> , both phenotypes are recovered by our model.

the model predicts that e2f loss-of-function abrogates proliferation, in agreement with the observation that human fibroblasts arrest or do not proliferate without e2f  <cit> . e2f gain-of-function induces apoptosis  <cit> , an outcome reproduced by the model in the presence of dna damage.

importantly, our model fairly reproduces the observation that a double knockout of mdmd <dig> and p <dig> rescues lethality of mdm <dig> knockout  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have defined a precursory logical model for the g1/s checkpoint where atr and atm pathways activation by single and double dna strand breaks is sufficient to determine three different cell fates: cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. atm/atr-p38mapk pathway in our model regulates the senescent fate decision.

despite a crude abstraction, our model accounts for most experimental evidences, especially regarding the senescent cell fate. although this phenotype can depend on the cell type, some mutations affecting this state are observed in numerous cell types and reproduced by our model; for instance, the senescent arrest arises from overexpression of p16ink4a  <cit>  and its abrogation from p <dig> or p16ink4a inactivation  <cit> . interestingly, the model predicts that cdc25a knockout enhances senescence, an outcome that could lead to a relevant target for intervention in cancer  <cit> .

at first glance, the model stable states seem to depend on the sole value of p38mapk . indeed, the logical rules defining p38mapk values perfectly match the dependence of the fates to the levels of dsb and ssb. obviously, this is not the case: the sole value of p38mapk is not enough to determine the resulting cellular fate. this is demonstrated through perturbation analyses: p38mapk loss-of-function leads to cell-cycle arrest phenotypes in addition to the proliferative state; for a mild ectopic expression of p38mapk, a senescent state appears in addition to the expected cell-cycle arrest outcome; finally, a p38mapk ectopic expression at level  <dig> leads to the cell-cycle arrest phenotypes, besides the senescent outcome. it is only when p38mapk is maintained at its level  <dig> that we have the sole apoptotic outcome.

moreover, our model displays neither multi-stability , nor stable oscillations. this can be explained through the analysis of its regulatory circuits. indeed, regulatory circuits are known to be responsible for the emergence of dynamical properties; negative circuits  are related to oscillations, whereas positive circuits  induce multi-stability  <cit> . the  positive circuit of the network encompasses cdk2cyce, rb <dig> and e2f and has a functionality context in which the system cannot be maintained. noteworthy, if p16ink4a is maintained at a positive level , this functionality context is stable when dsb=ssb =  <dig> and indeed, there is multi-stability under this stress condition, with two stable states differing by their values of the circuit members.

the lack of p <dig> oscillations that are involved in the choice of cell fate  <cit>  can be viewed as a limitation of the model. these oscillations are driven by the negative circuit , known to produce a p <dig> oscillatory response to dna damage . a closer look to p <dig> logical function indicates why this circuit is not functional in our model . the interaction from mdm <dig> to p <dig> selects p <dig> levels between  <dig> and  <dig> , whereas the threshold of the interaction from p <dig> to mdm <dig> is  <dig>  this points towards a potential revision of the model to account for this oscillatory behaviour.

future extensions include the consideration of components involved in the g2/m checkpoint in response to dna damage  <cit> . moreover, the model could be improved by incorporating nf-kb, involved in inflammatory responses and having an anti-apoptotic function in dna damage response  <cit> . for simplicity, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are partly embodied in p38mapk in our model. due to their important role in stress-induced cell fate decisions, it would be valuable to extend our model with this network, e.g. relying on the logical model recently published by grieco et al.  <cit> .
