BACKGROUND
bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms to avoid killing by bacteriophages , which are abundant in the environment. one group of mechanisms, usually denoted as phage exclusion, or abortive infection , is characterized by a normal start of the infection process, followed by an interruption of intracellular phage development, leading to the release of few or no progeny particles and the death of the infected cell. as a consequence, further propagation of phages is prevented and the bacterial population survives.

abi mechanisms are widespread in bacteria  <cit> , but have been mainly reported in escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis  <cit> . the best studied mechanisms, f-factor mediated t <dig> exclusion, lambda rex, prr and lit, all operate in e. coli  <cit> . despite their diverse modes of action, all these systems involve a cellular protein whose function is activated or inhibited following phage infection  <cit> . thus, abis are considered as "altruistic death modules" that favour cell population survival following phage infection. however, recent findings suggest that abi mechanisms might have other functions besides mediating phage resistance. the latent prrc nuclease was shown to be induced by normal cell constituents such as pyrimidine nucleotides, which suggests that this enzyme could play roles in addition to warding off phage t <dig> infection  <cit> . pifa is suggested to be a sensor for certain environmental changes  <cit> . similarly, the rex operon could prevent programmed cell death in starved e. coli cells by inhibiting the clpp family of proteases or cause a stationary phase-like response  <cit> . however, except for phage encoded proteins, no environmental signals responsible for abi activation have been identified.

lactococcal abi systems have been shown to interfere with different steps of phage development, including dna replication, maturation and packaging, transcription, capsid production and lysis of infected cells  <cit> . however, the molecular basis of these events, and the regulation of abi systems are poorly understood. unlike e. coli mechanisms, phage-dependent activation of abis has not yet been demonstrated in lactococci. no alteration in transcriptional levels was observed for abia, abib, abid <dig> and abig genes examined for induction by respective phages  <cit> . a slight increase of specific transcript after phage infection was demonstrated only for abip gene  <cit> . however, some experimental data suggests post-transcriptional regulation of expression and/or function of lactococcal abis. abir requires an associated methylase to protect the host from its own action  <cit> . cloning of intact abig was shown to be lethal for heterologous e. coli cells  <cit> . therefore, direct or indirect induction of latent abi activity by an infecting phage or/and other factors in l. lactis is quite probable  <cit> .

the abid <dig> abortive infection mechanism is encoded by a single gene, abid <dig>  of plasmid pil <dig>  <cit> . over-production of abid <dig> was shown to have bacteriostatic effect in l. lactis cells suggesting a tight control of abid <dig> expression in its natural genetic background  <cit> . expression of abid <dig> was proposed to be induced following phage infection  <cit> .

among dozens of abid <dig> sensitive phages, only the small isometric-headed phage bil <dig> is able to form spontaneous abid1-resistant mutants. these mutants have been used to study the abid <dig> mode of action  <cit> . phage sensitivity to abid <dig> is determined by the m operon, which is expressed in mid-infection, and contains four orfs, denoted orf <dig> to orf <dig>  the orf <dig> product is essential for phage development and its activity decreases in the presence of abid <dig>  <cit> . we showed that orf <dig> is a structure-specific endonuclease homologous to the e. coli ruvc resolvase  <cit> , which appears to be crucial for phage dna replication and maturation prior to packaging  <cit> .

all bil <dig> abid1r mutants contain a point mutation within orf <dig>  the first gene of the m-operon, coding for a  <dig> amino acid peptide. one abid1r mutant has an amino acid change  and others have a stop codon within the first  <dig> residues . the n-terminal region of orf <dig> plays a key role in phage sensitivity to abid <dig>  phages deleted for the corresponding orf <dig> region are viable and resistant to abid <dig>  however, the c-terminal region downstream of the met <dig> codon is essential for phage viability and cannot be deleted from the phage genome  <cit> . expression of orf <dig> in trans increases abid <dig> efficiency and prevents growth of abid1r phage mutants. orf <dig> has no known homologs in the sequence databases. we proposed that, similar to e. coli exclusion systems that are activated by phage-encoded proteins, orf <dig> activates latent abid <dig> during phage infection, while mutant orf <dig> proteins from abid1r phages fail to do so  <cit> . the molecular mechanism leading to abid <dig> activation remains to be clarified.

to gain insight into the mechanism of abid <dig> activation and to identify potential abid <dig> activation signals, we studied the regulation of abid <dig> expression. here we show that phage-encoded orf <dig> protein specifically activates expression of abid <dig> at the level of abid <dig> mrna translation. moreover, expression of abid <dig> is activated at the translational level independently of phage infection during growth of cells at low temperature.

mrna extraction and analysis
total rna was extracted using high pure rna isolation kit  according to manufacturer's manual. northern blot experiments were performed using a nylon hybond xl membrane  and oligonucleotide n° <dig> as a probe . oligonucleotides used for hybridization were labeled at the 5'-end with  atp using t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  as described by the supplier. northern dot-blot analysis was performed using bio-dot microfiltration apparatus  according to instruction manual. for this,  <dig> μg, and successive dilutions, of rna sample extracted from cells grown at 30°c and 18°c were treated with  <dig> u of rnase-free dnase i  for  <dig> min at 37°c and used for hybridization with abid1-specific or luxab-specific probe. the abid <dig> dna fragment was amplified using oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  the luxab dna fragment was amplified using oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  rna was quantified with a phosphorimager using imagequant  software. the quantitative reverse transcription-pcr was used to quantify mrnas. twenty μg rna, extracted from 2-ml cultures, were treated with  <dig> u of rnase-free dnase i  for  <dig> min at 37°c. cdnas were then synthesized using the reverse transcriptase reaction, using the cyscribe cdna postlabelling kit  with some modifications: rna samples were incubated for  <dig> h at 42°c in a 20-μl reaction containing random nonamer primers, reverse transcriptase buffer, dithiothreitol, dntps, and  <dig> u of superscript iii reverse transcriptase . gene sequences were amplified from cdna dilutions by pcr and quantified using an abi prism  <dig> . for the abid <dig> transcript, cdna was amplified using oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  for the lux transcript, cdna amplification was carried out using oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  results were normalized using the l. lactis tuf gene, coding for the elongation factor tu, as control. tuf cdna was amplified using oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  changes in relative amounts of transcript mrna normalized to tuf were determined using the relative ct method  <cit> .

plasmid construction
fusions between abid <dig> translation initiation regions  and luxab genes were constructed by cloning different fragments of abid <dig> tir between the bamhi and ecori sites of the pbluescript skii plasmid vector . then, luxab genes were inserted at the atg start position of tirs by cloning the luciferase plasmid fusion vector pjim <dig>  <cit>  at the ndei site. finally, pbluescript skii dna was deleted from the resulting plasmids by ecori digestion and self-ligation. different abid <dig> tir dna fragments were amplified using pil <dig> plasmid dna, oligonucleotide n° <dig> carrying bamhi and ndei sites, and one of the following oligonucleotides: n° <dig>  carrying an ecori site , n° <dig> carrying an ecori site , n° <dig> carrying an ecori site . the abid <dig> tir iv fragment was amplified using fragment ii cloned in pbluescript skii plasmid vector as a template, oligonucleotides n° <dig>  carrying an ecori site and n° <dig>  carrying a clai site. resulting plasmids were designated pil <dig> , pil <dig> , pil <dig>  and pil <dig> . the orf <dig> gene from phage bil <dig> and bil66m <dig> or bil66m <dig> mutants was inserted upstream of the different abid <dig> tir:luxab fusions. for this, pcr fragments corresponding to the different orf <dig> genes were first cloned in the pbluescript skii plasmid vector. fragments were recovered by digestion with ecori, and then cloned at the ecori site of plasmids pil <dig> and pil <dig>  oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig> were used for the pcr amplification. aldb:luxab fusion plasmid pil <dig> was constructed in the same manner using oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  carrying ecori and bamhi , and ndei sites . to construct plasmid pil <dig>  the orf <dig> gene from phage bil <dig> was inserted at the ecori site of pil <dig>  to integrate the orf <dig> gene from phage bil <dig> or bil66m <dig> into the b. subtilis chromosome, both genes were initially cloned into paci, bamhi sites of plasmid psweet  <cit> . to do this, orf <dig> or orf1m <dig> pcr fragments were amplified with oligonucleotides n° <dig> carrying a paci site and n° <dig> carrying a bamhi site. cloning was performed in e. coli strain tg <dig>  the resulting plasmids were targeted to amye of b. subtilis via double recombination as linear dna, using psti-digested plasmid. to construct plasmid pil <dig>  the rbfa gene from l. lactis il <dig> was amplified with oligonucleotide n° <dig>  carrying a sali site, and n° <dig>  carrying a psti site, and ligated to sali, psti-digested plasmid pgkv <dig>  <cit> .

luciferase assay
l. lactis il <dig> cells transformed with various luxab constructs were grown to an optical density at  <dig> nm  of  <dig>  at either 30°c or 18°c in m <dig> medium. experimental conditions for oxidative stress and acid ph used for the luciferase assay were mainly as described  <cit> . exponentially growing l. lactis il  <dig> cells were incubated with  <dig> mm h2o <dig> to generate oxidative stress conditions. the range of acid ph tested was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . b. subtilis  <dig> cells were grown to an od <dig> of  <dig>  at 30°c in lb medium in the presence of glucose, washed in lb and grown to an od <dig> of  <dig>  at 30°c in lb medium in the presence of xylose. to measure luciferase activity,  <dig> ml of culture was mixed with  <dig> μl of nonylaldehyde , and the light emission was measured immediately in a lumat lb <dig> luminometer .

western blotting
the  <dig> × flag peptide sequence was cloned in the ndei site of abid <dig> tir i:luxab fusion plasmid pil <dig>  the dna fragment carrying the  <dig> × flag peptide sequence was obtained by pcr amplification using p <dig> × flag-cmv- <dig> expression vector  as a template and oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig> each carrying an ndei site. the final construct was verified by sequencing. l. lactis cells carrying flag tagged abid <dig> tir i:luxab fusion plasmid were grown to an od <dig> of  <dig>  at either 30°c or 18°c in m <dig> medium medium supplemented with  <dig> % glucose. cells were harvested, resuspended in  <dig> mm tris-hcl,  <dig> mm edta buffer, and lysed with  <dig> mg/ml lysozyme  at 37°c  <dig> min. equal amounts  of proteins were separated on 8% sds-page gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon hybond-p membrane . the membrane was blocked in tris-buffered saline- <dig> % tween  <dig> with 5% nonfat milk overnight and afterwards incubated sequentially with anti-flag tag mouse monoclonal antibody m <dig>  for  <dig> h and then alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg  for  <dig> h. immunolabeled proteins were revealed using ecl plus western blotting detection system  according to manufacturer's manual. proteins were quantified with a phosphorimager using the imagequant software.

production and purification of orf <dig> protein
protein expression and purification were performed using the impact-sn system . the orf <dig> gene from phage bil <dig> and bil66m <dig> was cloned in the ptyb <dig> expression vector. the dna fragment carrying orf <dig> was obtained by pcr amplification using phage dna as a template and oligonucleotides n° <dig>  or n° <dig> , both carrying a sapi site and n° <dig>  carrying an ecori site. final constructs with 5' intein-tagged orf <dig> genes were controlled by sequencing. expression was performed in bl <dig>  e. coli cells at 17°c upon  <dig> h of induction with  <dig>  mm iptg. proteins extracted from the soluble fraction were further cleaved from the intein part and purified as recommended by the supplier. purity of the final orf <dig> protein preparation, evaluated using the novex nupage pre-cast gel system , was > 90%. the first eight n-terminal amino acids  were confirmed by maldi-tof  to be identical to those deduced from the nucleotide sequence: the molecular mass of purified protein was  <dig>  da and corresponded to the theoretical molecular mass  of orf <dig>  orf1m <dig> and orf1m <dig> proteins were purified in the same manner.

rna binding experiments
abid <dig>  aldb, trpa, osmc and m-operon rna transcripts were prepared by run-off transcription of dna templates with t <dig> rna polymerase transcription kit  in the presence of  rutp  according to manufacturer's manual. the different abid <dig> dna templates were obtained by pcr with the following oligonucleotides carrying the t <dig> promoter sequence: n° <dig> , n° <dig> , n° <dig> , n° <dig> , n° <dig> , n° <dig> , and used with oligonucleotides n° <dig> , n° <dig> , n° <dig>  and n° <dig> . the dna template for l. lactis il <dig> osmc rna transcript was obtained by pcr with oligonucleotides: n° <dig> and n° <dig>  the dna template for l. lactis il <dig> aldb rna transcript was obtained by pcr with oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  the dna template for l. lactis il <dig> trpa rna transcript was obtained by pcr with oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  the dna template for bil <dig> m-operon rna transcript was obtained by pcr with oligonucleotides n° <dig> and n° <dig>  the labelled rna transcripts were purified by elution after separation on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature. purified rnas were resuspended in binding buffer  and renatured by heating to 90°c for  <dig> min and chilling on ice for  <dig> min. binding reaction mixture, containing  <dig> ng of the labeled transcript and various concentrations of purified orf <dig> protein in  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm dtt, 5% glycerol, was incubated at 20°c for  <dig> min. reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature.

RESULTS
transcriptional analysis of abid1
to investigate the regulation of abid <dig> gene expression, we first examined the abid <dig> transcriptional unit. sequence analysis of plasmid pil <dig>  suggested that abid <dig> might be transcribed in an operon with two downstream genes, coding for putative proteins of unknown function . a putative terminator sequence was identified  <dig>  kb downstream of the determined transcription start  <cit> . however, previous attempts to visualize a full-length abid <dig> transcript in northern experiments were unsuccessful. the only visible transcript initiated at abid <dig> promoter was  <dig> b long and was shown to stop at a terminator structure localized just upstream of the abid <dig> gene  <cit>  . full-length abid <dig> transcript was not revealed by northern blot during abortive infection of il <dig> abid1+ cells with sensitive phage bil <dig>  <cit> . taking into account the pronounced abortive infection phenotype of il <dig> abid1+ cells, we hypothesized that during phage infection, full-length abid <dig> transcript is present in functional amounts, but is probably highly unstable. to overcome this putative instability, we tried to visualize the full-length abid <dig> transcript by extracting rna in the presence of chloramphenicol , which is known to stabilize bacterial mrnas  <cit> . two transcripts of  <dig> b and approximately  <dig>  kb were revealed upon hybridization with primer  <dig>  the larger being much less abundant that the smaller . this  <dig> -kb abid <dig> transcript was not observed when rna was extracted in the absence of cm, thus confirming low stability of abid <dig> mrna.

these results, together with those published earlier  <cit> , indicate that the low amounts of the  <dig>  kb mrna transcript is most likely due to activity of the transcriptional terminator located upstream of the abid <dig> gene. read through across this terminator would be responsible for expression of abid <dig>  to investigate the possibility that phage-encoded protein might increase synthesis of the full-length  <dig>  kb abid <dig> transcript either by an anti-termination mechanism or by stabilization of specific mrna, we studied the synthesis of abid <dig> mrna after phage infection using quantitative reverse transcription pcr  technique. the amount of the full-length abid <dig> transcript was determined during one cycle of phage bil <dig> multiplication, which takes approximately  <dig> min. rna samples were taken immediately before , in the middle  and at the beginning of the late  steps of phage infection  <cit> . our results show that the amount of full-length abid <dig> transcript varied little during phage infection, and decreased slightly with time . taken together, these results indicate that abid <dig> is co-transcribed with two other genes of unknown function. the unstable full-length  <dig>  kb abid <dig> transcript results from read through across the transcriptional terminator and is present in low amounts, which do not increase during abortive infection with sensitive phage. this suggests that activation of the abid <dig> mechanism is not exerted at the level of synthesis or stabilization of abid <dig> full-length mrna.

analysis of abid <dig> expression at the translational level
expression of abid <dig> was examined at the translational level. translation initiation region  of abid <dig> mrna is  <dig> nucleotides long, and contains a transcriptional terminator, and a ribosome binding site  uuugaagg complementary to the l. lactis 16s rrna sequence with one mismatch   <cit> . the rbs is preceded by a poly-u sequence, which is a part of the transcription terminator . analysis of the abid <dig> tir sequence using mfold version  <dig>  suggests the existence of a stem-loop structure  immediately downstream of the transcriptional terminator  <cit> . this structure could potentially sequester two elements known to positively control translation initiation efficiency, namely the rbs sequence and the poly-u sequence, which provides a binding site for ribosomal s <dig> protein  <cit> . predicted by mfold mrna secondary structure was cross-validated by the programs rnafold and kinefold  <cit> .

to test abid <dig> translation efficiency we used the luxab reporter gene from vibrio fischeri  <cit> . four dna fragments corresponding to different parts of abid <dig> tir but missing the abid <dig> promoter sequence were fused to the atg start codon of the luxab reporter gene that lacked its translational signals . translation of luxab is thus dependent on initiation signals carried on the cloned abid <dig> tir fragment. the constructs were transcribed from a constitutive plasmid promoter  <cit> . the four cloned fragments ended at the abid <dig> atg site and differed at their 5' ends . tir i starts at the +  <dig> transcription initiation point and would be able to form two stem-loop mrna structures. tir ii contains a truncated transcriptional terminator stem-loop and an rbs-sequestering stem-loop mrna. tir iii contains a shortened poly-u sequence and would most probably not sequester the rbs. tir iv contains only the abid <dig> rbs sequence. resulting plasmids were tested for their capacity to direct luciferase synthesis in l. lactis il <dig> cells. luciferase activities detected with tir i, ii or iv were weak . removal of the transcriptional terminator sequence  has no positive effect on luciferase activity, confirming that it does not play a major role in regulating abid <dig> expression. luciferase activity detected with tir iii was  <dig> -fold higher, suggesting that sequestering of abid <dig> rbs by secondary structure has a negative effect on translation efficiency. nevertheless, the level of luciferase activity directed by abid <dig> tir iii was relatively low: a control, the lactococcal aldb rbs cloned on plasmid vector pjim <dig>  which reached  <dig> ±  <dig> ×  <dig> arbitrary light units   <cit> , while abid <dig> expression in the same context was ~100-fold lower. the difference observed between tir iii and tir iv suggests a possible role of the poly-u sequence in increasing translation initiation, similar to what was described in e. coli  <cit> . taken together, these results indicate that translation of abid <dig> mrna is inefficient and suggest that some trans-acting factor might be required for its activation.

phage orf <dig> activates translation of abid <dig> mrna
in the search for putative factors activating translation of abid <dig> mrna we gave special attention to the phage-encoded orf <dig> protein, whose expression in mid-infection is essential for bil <dig> abortive infection  <cit> . to explore the possibility that orf <dig> protein acts as an activator of abid <dig> expression, we studied the capacity of abid <dig> tir to direct luxab translation in the presence of orf <dig>  to keep a constant ratio between orf <dig> and abid <dig> tir in the different constructs, we cloned orf <dig> on plasmids carrying abid <dig> tir:luxab translational fusions, so that orf <dig> and abid <dig> tir:luxab were both transcribed from the same constitutive plasmid promoter. the fusion of luxab reporter gene with tir of l. lactis aldb gene, preceded by a stable secondary structure that trapped the aldb rbs  <cit>  was used as control. all plasmids were tested for luciferase activity in il <dig> cells. the presence of orf <dig> caused a 13- to 27-fold increase in luciferase production, depending on the abid <dig> tirs . we replaced phage orf <dig> gene by mutated orf <dig> alleles m <dig>  or m <dig> , coding for orf <dig> protein with an amino acid substitution or deletion of the n-terminal part, respectively. both mutations render bil <dig> phage resistant to abid <dig> and differ from orf <dig> by one nucleotide  <cit> . presence of mutated orf <dig> genes abolished the increase of luciferase activity .

the level of luciferase activity directed by the control aldb tir:luxab fusion was not increased in the presence of the orf <dig> gene . these results indicate that orf <dig> specifically increases expression of abid <dig>  to measure the amount of the specific transcript, we analyzed luxab mrna using qrt-pcr. similar amounts of luxab rna were detected in the presence and in the absence of either orf <dig> or orf1m <dig> gene for all tested constructs . these results indicate that the effect of orf <dig> on abid <dig> tir:luxab fusions is not exerted on the transcriptional level.

we also performed northern analysis of cm-stabilized abid <dig> specific mrna extracted from il <dig> abid1+ cells in the presence or absence of orf1-expressing plasmid pil <dig>  which is known to increase abid <dig> activity  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig> , the  <dig>  kb transcript was detected in equal amounts in the presence or in the absence of orf1w+.

as transcription-translation reactions are known to be highly conserved among bacterial species  <cit> , we used b. subtilis  <dig> cells to test orf <dig> activity in trans. first we measured luciferase activity directed by plasmid constructs in the presence or absence of orf <dig> in cis. luciferase activity directed by abid <dig> tirii:luxab in b. subtilis cells was 45-fold higher in the presence of orf <dig> compared to a control plasmid carrying abid <dig> tirii:luxab without orf <dig>  the orf1m <dig> did not increase translation of abid <dig> tir ii:luxab fusion . to test orf <dig> activity in trans, orf <dig> or its mutant orf1m <dig> allele were placed under the control of inducible b. subtilis pxyl promoter and integrated at the amye locus of b. subtilis chromosome. luciferase activity directed by abid <dig> tir ii:luxab fusion was measured at 30°c in the presence of 1% xylose. in these conditions, translation of abid <dig> tir ii:luxab fusion was activated approximately 7-fold in the presence of orf <dig> compared to the control. activation was not observed with orf1m <dig> . therefore, orf <dig> activates expression of abid <dig> tir:luxab fusion in trans and in cis in the heterologous b. subtilis host. taken together, our results indicate that orf <dig> positively regulates translation of the abid <dig> mrna. the activation function of orf <dig> is most probably specific, as it was abolished by mutations rendering phage resistant to abid <dig>  and it was not observed with control aldb tir:luxab fusion construct.

low temperature activates translation of abid <dig> mrna and abortive infection phenotype
the above results indicated that expression of abid <dig> is activated by the infecting bil <dig> phage. in a search for other potential extracellular induction signals, we measured the activity of abid <dig> tir i:luxab fusion in different cell growth conditions. various types of stress to which l. lactis is exposed during normal growth  were tested. among these, growth of il <dig> abid <dig> tir i:luxab cells at the temperature range of 18°c to 20°c was found to increase luciferase activity about 15-fold as compared to 30°c . this level of luciferase activity was reached after  <dig>  hours incubation of il <dig> abid <dig> tir i:luxab cells at 18°c. however, we also detected a 3-fold increase of the background luciferase level in cells carrying the control luxab plasmid pjim <dig> at 18°c, a phenomenon observed previously and attributed to more efficient folding of the luxab protein at low temperature  <cit> . correcting for this increase, growth at 18°c conferred 5-fold higher expression of luxab when fused to the abid <dig> tir i region .

to confirm cold-induced activation of expression initiated by abid <dig> tir at the protein level we constructed in-frame fusions of luxab with flag tag sequence on abid <dig> tir i:luxab plasmid pil <dig>  abid <dig> tir i directed synthesis of tagged luciferase at 30°c and 18°c was analyzed by western blotting with anti-flag antibodies. the amount of luxab-flag protein produced at 18°c was approximately 6-fold higher than at 30°c . thus, the corrected level of specific luciferase activity detected at 18°c corresponds well to the increased level of protein synthesis at this temperature, and not to more efficient luxab folding. the amount of luxab mrna was measured by qrt-pcr and dot-blot northern hybridization. both methods revealed similar amounts of luxab rna in cells grown at 30°c and 18°c . these results indicate that increase of luciferase activity of abid <dig> tir i:luxab fusion at 18°c is not due to activation of luxab transcription. no additional increase of luciferase activity was observed in the presence of orf <dig> at 18°c . these results suggest that abid <dig> expression is increased in l. lactis cells grown at 18°c, and that induction occurs at the translational level.

these results led us to measure efficiency of phage abortive infection at 18°c. phage bil <dig> and two abid1r bil <dig> mutants  were plated on il <dig> and il <dig> abid1+ cells grown at 30°c and 18°c . at 30°c phage bil <dig> formed spontaneous abid1r mutants at a frequency of 10- <dig> and the two bil <dig> mutants grew normally. at 18°c, in the presence of abid <dig>  spontaneous abid1r bil <dig> mutants were not observed and growth of the two resistant mutants was strongly inhibited. in the absence of abid <dig>  plaque-forming efficiency and plaque morphology of the wild type and mutant phages were similar at 18°c and at 30°c. these results confirm that the abid <dig> phenotype is strongly activated during cell growth at low temperature independently of phage infection. therefore, abid <dig> fits into the group of l. lactis cold shock-inducible proteins.

l. lactis rbfa protein inhibits activation of abid <dig> phenotype by low temperature, not by orf <dig> protein
overproduction of cold shock protein rbfa was shown to accelerate growth adaptation of e. coli at low temperature and greatly decreases the adaptation period following cold shock  <cit> . the rbfa protein is conserved in most prokaryotic organisms  <cit> .

to test whether high levels of rbfa protein weaken the abid <dig> phenotype activated either by phage encoded protein orf <dig> or by low temperature we cloned the l. lactis rbfa gene in high copy plasmid pgkv <dig> under the control of a strong constitutive promoter. the construct was introduced in the il <dig> abid1+ cells and abortive infection efficiency was determined at 30°c and 18°c . rbfa had no effect on phage development at 30°c. interestingly, growth of the bil66m <dig> abid1r phage on il <dig> abid1+ cells carrying the rbfa plasmid was as efficient at 18°c as at 30°c. in the absence of rbfa, bil <dig> m <dig> grew poorly at 18°c due to activation of abortive infection by low temperature . this indicates that in the absence of active orf <dig> protein synthesis of the abid <dig> protein was not induced by low temperature because of the presence of rbfa. in contrast, growth of wild type bil <dig> phage was not detected at 18°c in the absence of rbfa and was inefficient in the presence of rbfa, indicating that synthesis of abid <dig> is still activated in both strains by wild type orf <dig> protein . these results show that overproduction of rbfa  does not affect induction of abid <dig> abortive infection by the phage orf <dig>  intact in the wild-type phage,  abolishes induction of abid <dig> abortive infection by low temperature, favouring the notion that abid <dig> is a cold shock- regulated gene.

orf <dig> binds abid <dig> mrna
our study identified two abid <dig> activating signals, the phage-encoded protein orf <dig> and low temperature, both acting at the level of mrna translation. the orf <dig> activation pathway differs from the cold shock pathway as it was shown not to be susceptible to rbfa-mediated cell adaptation to growth at low temperature. we supposed that orf <dig> might activate translation of abid1via binding to abid <dig> mrna.

to examine this hypothesis we tested whether orf <dig> can specifically bind tir of abid <dig> mrna. for this purpose, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using purified orf <dig> protein and an abid <dig> transcript that was synthesized in vitro with phage t <dig> rna polymerase. the transcript, designated mrna  <dig>  starts at the +  <dig> transcription initiation point and is  <dig> nucleotides long . incubation of mrna  <dig> with increasing amounts of orf <dig> protein followed by electrophoresis in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel led to the appearance of bands with reduced mobility in the gel indicating the formation of rna-protein complexes . the presence of several retarded bands reflects either formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes with different protein contents or different conformations of the same complex. the migration profile was not altered by increasing kcl concentrations, indicating that rna-protein interactions are stable .

to localize a binding region for orf <dig>  other transcripts were tested . mrnas  <dig> and  <dig> start  <dig> and  <dig> bp downstream of +  <dig> transcription initiation point respectively. mrna  <dig> starts at the aug of the abid1-coding region, and thus lacks a translation initiation signal. mrna  <dig> starts at the +  <dig> transcription point and ends at the aug of the abid <dig> coding region. the mrnas  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the internal part of the abid <dig> gene. four transcripts  gave results similar to those obtained with mrna  <dig> . in contrast, orf <dig> did not bind transcripts  <dig> and  <dig>  to control specificity of orf1-rna binding we used two other l. lactis transcripts:aldb and trpa mrnas  <cit> . no binding to either rna was detected . these results indicate that orf <dig> specifically binds abid <dig> tir mrna in the 5'-region.

orf <dig> might recognize a specific rna motif
to identify putative sequences or structural determinants involved in orf <dig> interaction, we analyzed the mrna transcript sequences used in binding experiments . initial analyses using blast tools did not reveal any conserved sequence pattern in orf1-binding transcripts. in contrast, foldalign, a method which detects common stem-loop rna motifs in unaligned sequences  <cit> , revealed the presence of an mrna stem-loop secondary structure in all abid <dig> mrnas shown to bind orf <dig> . the secondary structures were cross-validated by mfold  <cit> . the putative rna secondary structures are weak , and are formed by au-rich rna , thus differing from stem-loop structure formed by l. lactis aldb tir gc-rich mrna . the structure present in abid <dig> rnas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is located upstream of the abid <dig> atg codon and sequesters abid <dig> rbs. the second structure present in rna  <dig> is located  <dig> nucleotides downstream of atg codon. rnas that were negative for orf <dig> binding  were devoid of such rna secondary structures.

we hypothesized that these structures could be involved in orf1-rna recognition. to verify this, we searched for other mrnas containing similar structures and tested whether they can bind orf <dig>  first, we analyzed the sequence of the phage bil <dig> mid-infection m-operon coding for orf <dig>  the orf <dig> gene is known to be involved in the regulation of expression of a phage structure-specific dna endonuclease, encoded by the same operon  <cit> . the foldalign method revealed a putative au-rich rna secondary structure  within the m-operon mrna, upstream of orf <dig> rbs, which initiates translation of the endonuclease . moreover, no secondary structures like those above could be detected in 5'-untranslated sequences of two l. lactis genes coding for abid and abif abortive infection proteins, which share 28% to 46% of identity with abid <dig> protein, but are not regulated by orf <dig> . we also looked at known l. lactis cold-shock inducible genes, pgmb, osmc, llrc, hsla and clpx  <cit> . interestingly, foldalign revealed possible structures similar to those described above, upstream of putative rbs motifs of each of these genes . in contrast, no such structures were found in the intragenic regions of l. lactis il <dig> biosynthetic trp and his operons, which are known not to be regulated by low temperature .

next, we tested the capacity of orf <dig> to bind two mrnas containing the identified rna motif: phage m-operon and l. lactis osmc. transcripts were synthesized in vitro using phage t <dig> rna polymerase. m-operon transcript started at the +  <dig> transcription initiation point, was  <dig> nucleotides long, and included the rbs and the putative stem-loop structure.l. lactis osmc transcript started  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the atg codon, was  <dig> nucleotides long, and included the rbs and the putative stem-loop structure. orf <dig> was able to bind both osmc mrna and m-operon mrna . taken together, our results suggest that orf <dig> most probably binds mrna via recognition of specific secondary structure motif.

orf <dig> binding alone does not account for abid <dig> translation activation
to test whether orf <dig> binding to the abid <dig> mrna is sufficient to activate abid <dig>  we purified the two mutant proteins, orf1m <dig> and orf1m <dig>  encoded by abid <dig> resistant phages bil66m <dig> and bil66m <dig>  although these proteins are unable to activate abid <dig> translation, they were found to bind abid <dig> mrnas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the same manner as wild-type orf <dig>  and not rnas  <dig> and  <dig> . these results indicate that activation of abid <dig> translation is not due exclusively to orf <dig> binding, even if it seems likely that binding plays a role in activation.

discussion
expression of the lactococcal phage abortive infection mechanism abid <dig> is repressed under normal growth conditions and activated following phage infection and during cell growth at low temperature. phage orf <dig> protein and cold shock are shown here to activate expression of the abid <dig> gene at the level of mrna translation.

expression of abid <dig> is tightly controlled. transcription of abid <dig> is weak, and abid <dig> mrna is unstable and poorly translated. a putative mrna stem-loop structure in the abid <dig> tir might sequester both the abid <dig> rbs and an upstream poly-u sequence. using translational fusions of abid <dig> tirs with luxab gene, we showed that this structure had a negative effect on luciferase synthesis. however, even with a free access to the abid <dig> rbs, translation initiation was inefficient. these data suggest that abid <dig> full expression might depend on activation. here we show that the phage bil <dig> orf <dig> gene, which is responsible for its sensitivity to abid <dig>  activates abid <dig> translation. in contrast, the orf <dig> genes from abid1r mutants do not activate translation. this positive regulation of the abid <dig> phage abortive mechanism is somewhat similar to activation of the e. coli exclusion systems lit and prr by phage t <dig> encoded proteins gol and stp, respectively, as mutations in the corresponding phage genes abolish activation  <cit> . thus, activation of latent abi mechanisms by phage proteins synthesized during infection seems to be a feature common to different mechanisms. our study describes the first example of a mechanism in which abi activation takes place at the level of translation.

examples of protein-mediated positive regulation of translation, like that described in this paper, are very rare. those studied are mediated by modification of local mrna structure, thereby facilitating ribosome access to rbs, or by modification of some components of the cellular transcription-translation apparatus with consequent change in translation of some specific mrnas  <cit> . post-transcriptional mechanisms were shown to play a major role in adaptation of vegetative e. coli cells to the cold. preferential translation of cold shock-induced genes at low temperatures is due to cis-elements found in the 5'-untranslated region of at least some mrnas and trans-acting factors  <cit> . activation of the abid <dig> translation and the consequent abortive infection phenotype by a temperature decrease of 10°c–12°c is of immediate interest, as such a temperature drop was shown to induce a cold-shock response  <cit> . it therefore appears that abid <dig> is a cold shock-inducible protein. this conclusion is supported by the observation that overproduction of the ribosome binding factor rbfa, which is essential for ribosomal adaptation to the cold, prevents induction of abid <dig> by low temperature.

the detailed mechanism of orf <dig> action remains to be established. binding to a structure found in the 5'-untranslated regions of abid <dig> and phage m-operon mrnas could be involved. nevertheless, the mutant proteins that were unable to activate abid <dig> translation, do bind the motif with comparable efficiency, which indicates that binding alone is not sufficient for activation. we propose that in the course of phage infection orf <dig> binds to abid <dig> mrna and acts as a "platform" that interacts with additional factors involved in mrna translation. in this case, mutations would alter the interaction. similar mechanism was proposed for e. coli hfq protein involving in regulation of translation of rpos gene  <cit> . identification of the cellular partner of orf <dig> protein should clarify our understanding of orf1-mediated translational activation of abid <dig> expression, and the role of the orf <dig> gene in phage development.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied expression of the abid <dig> gene at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. expression of abid <dig> is specifically activated at the level of mrna translation by the phage-encoded orf <dig> protein. the loss of ability to activate translation of abid <dig> mrna determines the molecular basis for phage resistance to abid <dig>  identification of temperature decrease as an environmental signal activating abid <dig> phenotype indicates that the abid <dig> is a cold shock inducible gene.
