BACKGROUND
endurance exercise can be defined as cardiovascular exercise —such as running, cross-country skiing, cycling, aerobic exercise or swimming— that is performed for an extended period of time  <cit> . endurance athletes expose their bodies to extreme physiological conditions that disrupt homeostasis  <cit> . the main adaptations to endurance exercise include changes in neuromuscular and contractile functions in muscles  <cit> , correction of electrolyte imbalance  <cit> , decreased glycogen storage  <cit> , increased mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle tissue  <cit> , body temperature regulation, oxidative stress  <cit> , increased intestinal permeability and hypoperfusion, muscle damage, systemic inflammation and immune responses  <cit> . additionally, the physical demands during intense exercise can trigger a stress response activating the sympatho-adreno-medullary and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal  axes, which results in the release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormones, glucocorticoids and catecholamines into the circulatory system .

horses serve as an optimal in vivo model for characterizing the response to endurance exercise due to their natural aptitude for athletic performance and the homogeneity of their genetic and environmental backgrounds  <cit> . as described by capomaccio et al.  <cit> , the effort that an equine athlete exerts during an endurance competition is comparable to that of a human marathoner or ultra marathoner.

over the past decade, the transcriptional and translational mechanisms of gene regulation that control the responses to endurance exercise have been studied by many authors . however, gene and mirna expression data might only indicate the potential physiological effects because many pathway feedback mechanisms are simply not reflected in gene expression changes  <cit> . for this reason, metabolomics, which focuses on the final “omic” layer of a biological system, has emerged as a more integrative approach towards the understanding of the biological functions of an organism  <cit> . it has been recently shown that proton nuclear magnetic resonance -based metabolomic analysis of horse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  serum employing unsupervised statistical methods enabled the detection of certain classes of metabolites such as lactate, amino acids, lipids, nucleic acids, and secondary metabolites whose levels had been modified in response to endurance exercise. metabolites, such as those previously mentioned, are the result of a continuum of many integrated enzymatic and non-enzymatic steps, which include numerous intermediaries that are regulated by the host genome, epigenome, metagenome, food and drink consumption, drug use and exposure to pollutants.

to date, most studies in the field of metabolomics have failed to fully explain all of the alterations that occur during the metabolic regulatory processes, tissue lesions or organ dysfunctions that athletes face when coping with stress responses during endurance exercise . the need for a deeper understanding of how these regulatory metabolic networks function in response to endurance exercise has led to increased efforts to model multiple “omic” dimensions simultaneously. therefore, we performed an integrated analysis of the blood metabolome, transcriptome and mirnome in horse athletes that participated in an endurance competition. we hypothesized that the identification of the relationships between blood metabolome, transcriptome and mirnome, which are specifically regulated by endurance exercise in horses, could  characterize the complex interplay between serum metabolome and whole-blood transcriptome and mirnome data; and  reveal unique biomarkers of reactions to stress during endurance exercise.

RESULTS
the morphological and physiological parameters of the  <dig> equine athletes used in the study are summarized in additional file  <dig>  whereas the biochemical parameters obtained from blood samples collected after the endurance competition are represented in the additional file  <dig>  all horses showed above-average total bilirubin, creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, and serum amyloid a concentrations, reflecting hemolysis and muscular membrane permeability or inflammation.

endurance competition affected the expression of a large number of genes, mirnas and metabolites

1h nmr spectra together with custom equine mrna and mirna microarrays were used on an experimental set of ten horses to study the effects that endurance exercise has on the blood metabolome, transcriptome and mirnome. before delving into multi-layered data sets integration for the analysis of the regulatory network, we assessed the quality and significance of each “omic” layer individually.

a total of  <dig> metabolic peaks were identified, including several amino acids, energy metabolism-related metabolites, saccharides, and organic osmolytes in the plasma . among the  <dig> metabolic peaks identified, we observed two unassigned compounds at  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  ppm, respectively .fig.  <dig> metabolic regulation in the cell after endurance exercise. endurance exercise increased the production of pyruvate from anaerobic glycolysis to compensate for atp production. on one hand, pyruvate was converted into lactate. on the other hand, pyruvate entered in the tca cycle to produce nadh and semiquinone. the oxphos of fatty acids increased, while amino acids were deaminated to fuel the tca cycle during the endurance competition, which increased the production of ammonia. because glucose levels become too low during endurance exercise, the keto acid oxaloacetate was preferentially utilized in the process of gluconeogenesis, instead of reacting with acetyl coa, and diverted to ketone body formation . in the figure, the node color intensity indicates the associated expression level: red = over-expression at t <dig> and green = under-expression at t <dig>  g-6-p, glucose 6-phosphate; f-6-p, fructose 6-phosphate; f- <dig>  6-bp, fructose- <dig> - bisphosphate; gsh, reduced glutathione; gssg, oxidized glutathione; pep, phosphoenolpyruvate; r-5-p, ribose-5-phosphate. *denotes statistical significance at  <dig>  level. figure adapted from kruiswijk et al.  <cit>  with permission from nature publishing group 




the effect exercise had on the serum metabolome was described by multivariate statistical methods. on one hand, the principle component analysis  significantly discriminated pre and post-endurance competition samples . on the other hand, the orthogonal projections to latent structures  analysis revealed that a total of  <dig> metabolites resonances contributed in the discrimination of the pre and post-endurance competition samples . lactate, followed by methylene, n-acetyl moieties, proline, glucose and phosphocholine presented the highest contribution to class separation . more precisely, loadings examined on the pre-component basis as line plot emphasized that post-competition samples were characterized by higher excursion of lactate, glycerol, creatine, urea, and aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine, along with negative excursion of methylene, n-acetyl moieties, methylene esters, glucose, and phosphocholine .

to ensure the accuracy of the opls model , permutations testing and cross validation were used for internal validation of the opls model. the explained variance, predictive capability and out-of-bag error of opls model remained higher  =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ) than those of the  <dig> -permutated models  to discriminate pre- and post-endurance competition samples .

the relationship between metabolites and the functional map of the metabolites affected by the endurance exercise are provided in the additional file 5: figure s <dig> and additional file 6: figure s <dig>  respectively. among the most enriched pathways are those involved in glycerolipid metabolism, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid  cycle and amino acids metabolism .

afterwards, we focused on the identification of genes and mirnas whose expression was significantly altered at t <dig>  relative to t <dig> , with an adjusted p-value <  <dig>  after implementing benjamini and hochberg correction for multiple testing . the application of this threshold led to the identification of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes ,  <dig>  of which were over-expressed and  <dig>  of which were under-expressed at t <dig> . we identified  <dig> mirnas differentially expressed  when comparing pre- and post- endurance competition samples . along with orthologous human-equine demirnas, we detected  <dig> equine-specific demirnas.

a regulatory network of  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> genes, and  <dig> mirnas has a key role in controlling the adaptation to endurance exercise
the  <dig> metabolite resonances that significantly discriminated between pre and post- endurance competition samples, together with the  <dig>  degs and  <dig> demirnas were used to perform a multi-step approach and identify the dynamically co-regulated relationship among metabolites, genes and mirnas that could not be detected when analyzing only single metabolites or transcripts alone .

we performed two different complementary statistical approaches  to identify enriched metabolites with significantly more predictive metabolic genes among the degs than among other genes in the transcriptome. the enzyme-encoding genes whose protein products participate in the metabolic reaction of a given metabolite are referred to here as metabolic genes. next, for each of the metabolic genes, we used the multimir package in r to build a comprehensive list of all the putative demirna regulators.

in particular, we found a total of  <dig> differentially expressed metabolites  that were putatively regulated by a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes. interestingly, we discovered that the spatiotemporal expression of those  <dig> metabolic genes could be extensively regulated at the transcription and post-transcription level through a total of  <dig> demirnas. for instance, let-7b-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-21-5p, mir-92a-3p, and mir-192-5p regulated more than ten metabolic genes each .fig.  <dig> regulatory network linking metabolites, metabolic genes and mirnas. we identified a total of  <dig> unique metabolites, which were associated with a total of  <dig> unique metabolic target genes and  <dig> mirnas. the network is displayed graphically as nodes  and edges . the node color intensity indicates the expression level of the association: red = over-expression at t <dig> and green = under-expression at t <dig>  the node shape indicates whether the node is a tf , a mirna , a metabolite , membrane receptor , transporter , or other type of genes 




ultimately, we considered a total of  <dig> enriched metabolites correlated with the expression of  <dig> metabolic genes and  <dig> mirnas during exercise to create the regulatory network . this regulatory network underlined several well-known biochemical interactions, i.e., the relationships between the decreased glucose concentration after endurance exercise and the metabolic genes whose proteins participate in the forkhead box protein o  and glucagon signaling pathways to induce gluconeogenesis, and the relationship between lactate and metabolic genes encoding proteins related to glucagon signaling and propanoate metabolism . another well-known biochemical interaction was found between succinate and the expression of multiple components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  system, including multiple subunits of atp synthase , nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunits  and cytochrome oxidase subunits . as expected, the regulatory network also highlighted the interaction between glycerol and metabolic genes that encode enzymes participating in the pentose and glucuronate pathways, as well as acetate and many downstream genes of propanoate metabolism, which included activated protein kinase  activators such as acetyl-coa carboxylase  and acyl-coa synthetase short-chain family .

these well-known biochemical interactions were mainly regulated by mir-16-5p, mir-21-5p, mir-92a-3p, mir-192-5p and let-7b-5p within the regulatory network.

remarkably, the “omic” integration of molecular data in our study predicted some functional links between metabolites and the transcriptome that could not be characterized by analyzing separately any of the three individual data sets. one example is the functional enrichment of glutamate through metabolic genes belonging to the glutathione metabolism, which regulates the reactive oxygen species  and nitrogen oxide species  substances  gene family, gst-kappa  <dig> , and two microsomal gsts . in line with the exercise-induced oxidative stress, we observed a significant interaction between tyrosine and metabolic genes that affected the ubiquinone endogenous antioxidant levels. another example of the importance of “omic” integration was represented by the interaction between urea and genes involved in the catabolism of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides from atp to uric acid, in which free radicals are produced and cause muscle cell damage  <cit> . lastly, a significant interaction that could not be characterized by analyzing separately any of the three individual data sets was the link between lactate and the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor a  transcription factor, as well as lactate genes associated with the release of lipopolysaccharides -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including toll-like receptor  <dig> , followed by the activation of various immune-related transcription factors  such as signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  and the nuclear factor kappa beta .

moreover, we found that the regulatory network based on the  <dig> metabolic genes included tfs such as retinoblastoma-like  <dig> , followed by the cooperatively transcriptional cofactors sirtuin  <dig> , e1a binding protein p <dig> , creb binding protein , and b-cell lymphoma  <dig> protein . additionally, results suggested that these tfs might  regulate the spatiotemporal concentration patterns of glucose and lactate ; and  drive or repress the expression of metabolic genes and mirnas in a feed-forward and feedback manner  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> activators and repressors of the regulatory network. a the regulatory network was driven by different transcription factors able to up- or down regulate the glucose and lactate concentration . b the ep <dig> and sirt <dig> transcription factors could be regulated by the expression of let-7b-5p and mir-223-3p, respectively, and rbl <dig> might be inhibited by mir-192-5p. in the figure, the node color intensity indicates the associated expression level: red = over-expression at t <dig> and green = under-expression at t1




the regulatory network is driven by both transcription factors and mirnas
as suggested above, both tfs and mirnas might regulate endurance exercise response. in order to ensure the accuracy of tfs and mirnas regulation within the regulatory network, we decided to use the regulatory impact factor  algorithm  <cit> . our aim was to identify  putative causal regulators, and  the rewired transcriptional circuits through which the tfs and mirnas exert their regulatory impact on the transcriptome following exercise.

among the most enriched tfs and mirnas, we confirmed crebbp , ep <dig> , rbl <dig> , sirt <dig> , bcl <dig>  and let-7b-5p . details on the top regulators with greatest scores are fully listed in the additional file  <dig> 

the relationship between blood metabolome, transcriptome and mirnome that occurs during endurance exercise could be reproduced in an independent cohort of  <dig> horses
as a final analysis step, multiple factor analysis  was applied to an independent cohort of  <dig> horses to further emphasize the reliability of cross-layer “omic” analysis to predict or explain the exercise response adaptations and importantly, to confirm the interactions within our regulatory network. this independent cohort included  <dig> horses sampled only at t <dig>  and  <dig> other horses sampled only after completing the endurance competition .

at t <dig> , the mfa superimposed plot of each type of data and its barycenter showed particularly high levels of variability in all “omic” layers . however, the mfa projection plot of the partial representations for each “omic” layer  onto pc <dig> was tightly clustered . the two metabolites showing the highest correlation  on the first axis were glutamine and glucose, whereas the genes most strongly correlating with pc <dig>  were rna polymerase 21-kda subunit , torsin 3a , vesicle-associated membrane protein  <dig> , histone binding protein  <dig> , n1-acetyltransferase family member  <dig> , at-hook containing transcription factor  <dig> and various ribosomal proteins . the eca-mir- <dig>  mir-106b-5p, mir-138-5p, mir-148a, and mir-20a-5p were also highly linked to the first principal component  . genes such as e <dig> ligases  and tripartite motif containing  <dig>  presented high correlations with pc <dig> . the detailed weights of each metabolite, metabolic genes and mirna are provided in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> multiple factor analysis projection plot at t <dig> in an independent cohort of  <dig> animals. a the different “omics” data sets are connected by lines where the length of the line is proportional to the divergence between the data from a same animal. lines are joined by a common point, representing the reference structure, which maximizes covariance derived from the mfa synthetic analysis; b summarization of the concordance between “omics” data set on the space; c “omics” data sets are shown in the different dimensions while showing the contribution of each eigenvalue to the total variance; d boxplot of the expression of the molecules having high weights  on the pc <dig> of mfa; e boxplot of the expression of genes having high weights  on the pc <dig> of mfa. in all cases, animals that finished the endurance competition in the validation set were colored in cyan color, whereas animals in the validation set that were disqualified during the endurance competition were colored in dark red color. additionally, to ensure that expression levels of the animals in the validation set that finished the endurance competition  were similar to those of the experimental set that finished the endurance competition , for each molecule, expression levels of animals from experimental set  were also plotted. *, ** denote statistical significance at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  level respectively




although the size of the cohort used at t <dig> was relatively small, the mfa analysis revealed that the partial representation of the mean individuals for each “omic” layer was projected together according to their capacity to finish the endurance competition . thus, the molecular profiles at basal time of the animals that did not finish the endurance competition were projected close to each other in the space . in light of these findings, we wanted to understand whether the molecules detected at basal time could be considered as predictive biomarkers for the elimination during the endurance competition. although cause and effect are usually difficult to decipher, we compared basal profiles of molecules that showed high correlation values  on the two first dimensions of the mfa with animals that finished the endurance competition and animals that were eliminated during the endurance competition because of lameness or metabolic problems. we discovered that the polr2i, copr <dig>  sat <dig> and ube3c genes were clearly up regulated  at basal time in animals that were eliminated during the endurance competition, whereas tor3a and trim <dig> tended to be up regulated  at basal time. they also presented numerically higher glutamine and glucose concentrations at basal time .

the combined analysis of metabolome, transcriptome and mirnome on post-exercise samples then highlighted an interesting co-structure between data sets . metabolome profile accounted for the highest variance on pc <dig>  whereas the mirnome data were projected on the positive end of the pc <dig> . metabolites such as lactate and fatty acid methylene moieties presented high correlation values |r2| >  <dig>  with pc <dig>  together with let- <dig> family, mir-16-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-20ab-5p, mir-21-5p,mir-26b-5p and mir-98-3p . the lps-induced immune markers, specifically tlr <dig>  tnf alpha induced protein  <dig>  and interleukin- <dig> receptor-associated kinase-like  <dig> , were identified among the strongest variables of the pc <dig> , along with the increase in expression of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism   <dig> beta sub-complex 5; ndufb5).fig.  <dig> multiple factor analysis projection plot at t <dig> in an independent cohort of  <dig> animals. a the first two axes of mfa represent metabolome, transcriptome, and mirnome data sets at t <dig>  different shapes and colors represent the respective “omic” data sets, which are connected by lines where the length of the line is proportional to the divergence between the data from a same animal. lines are joined by a common point, representing the reference structure, which maximizes covariance derived from the mfa synthetic analysis. b summarization of the concordance between “omic” data sets on the space. c data sets are shown in the different dimensions while showing the contribution of each eigenvalue to the total variance; d boxplot of the expression of the molecules having high weights  on the pc <dig> of mfa; e boxplot of the expression of genes having high weights  on the pc <dig> of mfa. in all cases, to ensure that expression levels of the animals in the validation set confirmed those of the experimental set, for each molecule, expression levels of animals from the validation set  and experimental set  are plotted

discussion
the level of exercise performed by horses during an endurance competition is similar to that of a human ultra marathon runner   <cit>  or to a lesser extent a marathon runner   <cit> . endurance horses run 80–160 km endurance competitions that require energy expenditure and cause physical stress that the body must adapt to through coordinated metabolic, immune and hormonal responses in order to maintain homeostasis. our previous work on plasma metabolome profiling mainly demonstrated that adaptation to endurance exercise in horses simultaneously involved lipid, protein catabolism and glycoprotein pathways  <cit> . our previous study on blood transcriptome and mirnome response to endurance exercise in horses mainly reflected immune system processes through white blood cells as well as regulatory processes involved in various pathways such as glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrion biogenesis  <cit> . until this current study, our prior work had been limited to single levels of biological information, therefore neglecting the global network structure and cross talk that occurs across multiple layers of molecular organization.

no systematic exploration of information flow between the different biological “omic” layers had been carried out in athletes. therefore, we decided to explore the metabolic plasticity in response to endurance exercise by simultaneously combining plasma metabolite changes together with the blood transcriptome and mirnome from the same individuals. a similar study in humans had already described that the concurrent analysis of cross-sectional multi “omic” data from the same individuals could be a powerful tool to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that occur on a physiological scale such as fasting in elderly   <cit> .

integrating the results from circulating plasma metabolites, transcriptome and mirnome derived from the blood of ten endurance horses before and after an endurance competition, allowed us to reveal biologically reasonable relationships after the endurance competition, namely:  reduction of glucose concentration and inhibition of foxo signaling, which up-regulate genes involved in gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism and ketone body production and utilization, and activation of mir-21-5p expression  <cit> ;  increased oxphos to compensate for atp production; and  increased concentration of acetate, which subsequently induced ampk  <cit> .

additionally, we found several associations within our regulatory network, which to the best of our knowledge have not been fully described before. for example, our study showed that glutamate was enriched by co-expressed genes that regulate the control and removal of ros and rons molecules, such as the gst family, gstk <dig>  and two microsomal gsts, suggesting that under physical stress, glutamate might be used for the synthesis of glutathione, a major endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells. this is in agreement with the observed positive correlation between tyrosine  and the expression of genes associated with ubiquinone synthesis, which are redox active and essential lipophilic electron carriers of the mitochondrial electron transport chain involved in the q-cycle  <cit> . collectively, the results suggest that an elevated respiration rate during endurance exercise may have led to the generation of more ros than the antioxidant systems can scavenge, and that the increase in muscle injury  also reflected an increase in the generation of the ros to levels greater than the antioxidants can handle.

the presumably persisting oxidative stress and cell damage after competition was further confirmed by two different relationships within our regulatory network:  the relationship between lactate and genes that were likely involved in lps-induced pro-inflammatory pathway , and  the relationship between urea and genes involved in energy-purine and pyrimidine catabolism, which could result in the accumulation of uric acid and toxic oxygen free radicals in the cells  <cit> . of note, mir-92a-3p and mir-192-5p, which share the same seed sequence, were related to oxidative stress genes. as previously reported, the expression of mir-92a is regulated negatively by oxidative stress  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a model for increased intestinal permeability after exercise based on coordinated metabolite and gene expression after the endurance competition. intestinal homeostasis involves the coordinated actions of epithelial, innate and adaptive immune cells. our data showed an increase in tlr <dig>  which probably stimulated the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon alpha and gamma , or interleukin   <dig>  and sensed the translocated lps. we also observed an increase of foxo <dig>  which regulates il <dig> expression during a typical lps immune response, as well as stat <dig>  nfkb-rela, and interferon-gamma receptor . this also correlated with the observed increase in blood serum amyloid protein  in the post- endurance competition samples, an inflammatory marker. the node color indicates whether the node is a gene , or a metabolite . this figure was produced using servier medical art, available from www.servier.com/powerpoint-image-bank





to further emphasize the reliability of cross-layer “omic” analysis to predict or explain the endurance response adaptations and importantly, and to confirm the molecules within our regulatory network and their interactions, we applied the mfa approach, which can infer direct relationships between variables within a set of repeated observations in the absence of a priori knowledge. therefore, we used an independent cohort of  <dig> horses and we considered horses at t <dig> and horses at t <dig> separately. for each scenario , mfa was used to model interactions between the metabolome, the transcriptome and the mirnome. at basal time, the mfa approach gave insights about the reasons why a large number of horses analyzed in our independent cohort at t <dig> failed to finish the competition . this indicated potential future candidate biomarkers that could predict the increased likelihood for failure to finish an endurance competition. our mfa analysis suggested that the horses eliminated during the endurance competition already presented metabolic and inflammatory issues prior to the endurance competition possibly due to poor training preparation and feeding management, uncomfortable transport or other physiological reasons . thus, the exercise-induced stress experienced during the 160 km competition made it more difficult for them to control their energy and inflammation levels. for instance, proteins  related to lps-induced immune responses , and inflammation in the skeletal muscle tissue  were higher in animals that were eliminated during the endurance competition compared to horses that successfully finished the competition. additionally, horses that were eliminated during the endurance competition presented higher glutamine and sat <dig> expression, which is the transporter responsible for glutamine uptake in the neuronal compartment making them important components of the glutamate/gaba-glutamine cycle  <cit> . a study by keller et al.  <cit>  using 1h nmr metabolomic analysis of blood from horses with laminitis also showed increased glutamine levels, further pointing to metabolic issues as the underlying cause for elimination in these horses. overall, these results suggest that analyzing the expression of metabolic and transcript signaling before starting the endurance competition could be a useful tool to predict elimination during the endurance competition at basal time, though larger data sets studies aimed at investigating the predictive value of these biomarker candidates are needed.

when exploring the associations between biological processes across different biological layers in the post- endurance competition samples of our independent cohort, mfa highlighted the significant role that genomic factors play a lps-induced immune response, together with mitochondrial sspb <dig>  which protects cells from proteotoxis stress by increasing stress-induced heat-shock factor  <dig>  transcriptional activity  <cit> . we therefore confirm our hypothesis that an excessive release of stress hormones induced by physical stress during the endurance competition together with increased body oxygen uptake, lead to the generation of ros and rons in working muscles and in the tissues that undergo ischemia and hypoperfusion  <cit> . these processes are associated with cell damage and lps translocation outside of the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn triggers immune and inflammatory responses often resulting in increased intestinal permeability and ros  <cit> . in humans, depending on the type of exercise, intensity, age and other factors, between  <dig> and 50% of athletes suffer gastrointestinal symptoms, which have been shown to increase with exercise intensity  <cit> . marathon, triathlete and ultra endurance athletes have been reported to have plasma lps concentrations between  <dig> and 284 pg/ml and up to 93% of athletes reported digestive disturbances, which could be caused by the lps-induced cytokine response  <cit> .

in line with these results, the mfa was also able to pinpoint key mirnas that regulate the immune and inflammatory response to endurance exercise such as the let- <dig> family, mir-21-5p, mir-16-5p and mir-26b-5p. for instance, the up-regulation of circulating mir-21-5p in the plasma of human endurance athletes has been reported , as well as in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit>  and blood cells  <cit>  upon exercise. moreover, mir- <dig> had been shown to target specific genes involved in the janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway during exercise while modifying neutrophil immune function  <cit> . although there is limited understanding of the role let- <dig> plays in the molecular pathways involved in the endurance exercise, it has been shown that let- <dig> might inhibit the pro-inflammatory il <dig> expression indirectly through the nfκb pathway and can increase signaling pathway such as stat  <cit> . because the let- <dig> family has been detected in the horse liver, heart and muscles  <cit> , further studies are needed to decipher whether let- <dig> might be biomarker of muscle damage, myocardial injury or endotoxemia during equine endurance events.

while this study provides novel insight into the dynamic changes that metabolome, transcriptome and mirnome undergo during endurance exercise, it also has some limitations. first, the overall experimental sample size was small . second, the metabolome profiles in the current work contained only  <dig> variables per spectrum, much fewer compared to the gene and mirna expression profiling. third, the presented regulatory network significantly depends on knowledge about the biochemical pathways structure and involved regulatory interactions described in the human literature. fourth, working with large p, and small n was computationally challenging and rendered a more difficult interpretation of the relevant variables that provided more insight into the adaptation response of endurance exercise.

nevertheless, our results suggest that this small sample size was appropriate because the true effects of endurance exercise being estimated were genuinely large enough to be reliably observed in the blood. additionally, our results show that the limited number of metabolites measured was highly informative about the energy and redox status of the animals, as well as the protein catabolism and lps-induced immune responses. furthermore, we also demonstrated that although metabolites did not fit as neatly into the direct relationships of gene-transcript-protein  <cit>  and that transcripts and metabolites may not be synchronized in time, the physiological relevance of metabolite variation can be examined through the relationships between the transcript levels of different enzymes and their up or downstream metabolites.

finally, using a larger and independent cohort of endurance horses and mfa method, we were able to replicate the results observed in the small set of animals and confirm that the integrated analysis of different “omic” layers without a priori information provides more insights into the adaptive regulatory mechanisms to endurance exercise than any layer could by itself, highlighting the complementarity of an integrative approach. mfa method could be considered a useful approach to overcome computational issues when p > n and to display a low-dimensional projection of the data highlighting the main sources of variability.

CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights the potential of a systems-based approach for discovering the interactions between blood metabolome, transcriptome, and mirnome, which cannot be detected when analyzing single metabolites or transcripts. we were able to construct a regulatory network of  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> metabolic genes and  <dig> mirnas whose expression was significantly altered at t <dig>  relative to t <dig> . this network underlines essential adaptations necessary for homeostasis and performance during endurance exercise . remarkably, the “omic” integration showed that lactate and glucose metabolites were enriched by genes that coded proteins likely involved in lps-induced pro-inflammatory pathway, whereas glutamate and tyrosine were associated with genes that regulate the control and removal of ros and rons molecules.

in an independent cohort of  <dig> horses, multiple factor analysis confirmed the physiological adaptation to physical exertion through genes associated with lps-induced immune responses and oxidative stress, as well as mir-21-5p, mir-16-5p, and let- <dig> family. multiple factor analysis also shed light on key metabolomic and transcriptomic processes that occur in horses during endurance exercise, as well as potential transcriptomic markers at basal time for elimination during the endurance competition.

integrating results from circulating plasma metabolites, transcriptome and mirnome derived from whole blood allowed us to  confirm that strenuous exercise in horses leads to coordinated transcriptome and metabolome reactions at a systemic level, increasing the metabolic rate, the production of reactive oxygen species, inflammation and compromising antioxidant defense system,  identify potential candidate biomarkers at basal time that could predict the likelihood for failure to finish an endurance ride; and  provide a basis for future studies to gain novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control physiological adaptations to endurance exercise.
