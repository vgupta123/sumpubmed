BACKGROUND
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation  is a well defined treatment option for haematological disorders, such as lymphoma, leukaemia and anemia. the outcome depends strongly on the development of graft-versus-host disease  <cit>  next to disease relapse and infection. during the last decades, refinements in clinical practice  <cit>  and especially advances in human leukocyte antigen  matching  <cit>  have steadily improved survival after transplantation by reducing transplant-related complications. recently published data from comprehensive studies reviewed by shaw b. e. and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated a significant survival advantage in hsct when using donors matched for hla-a, -b, -c and -drb <dig> at allelic resolution. the loci hla-dqb <dig> and -dpb <dig> are still under discussion  <cit> .

in recent years, patients undergoing allogeneic hsct have greatly benefited from the deeper understanding of the hla system and notably from high-resolution definition of the classical transplantation antigens. the extensive allelic diversity of these loci is mainly driven by recombination, which results in patchwork pattern of sequence motifs and makes hla typing at 4-digit and now even at 2-digit level challenging. in this context, the numerous technological advancements in the field of immunogenetics are of particular importance, eminently the application of dna-based methodologies  <cit> .

currently, the “gold standard” for high-resolution hla typing is sanger sequencing. nevertheless, due to the ever increasing numbers of hla alleles in the international immunogenetics  hla database  <cit>    <cit> , histocompatibility testing is getting complex even if sequence-based typing  is used. defining the phase of sequence motifs becomes more difficult and therefore genotype ambiguity increases exponentially through every new database release  <cit> . therefore new typing strategies such as group-specific pcr  <cit>  or allele separation by group-specific sequencing primers  <cit>  prior to sequencing were developed. though these techniques achieve haplotype separation and are well-established in hla typing laboratories, they remain labor-intensive and commercial manufacturers are especially unwilling to develop the products in a timely fashion.

in  <dig>  massively parallel clonal sequencing technologies commonly termed as next-generation sequencing  techniques  <cit>  were introduced with the expectation of trouble-free hla genotyping without limitations on high-resolution and high-throughput. in  <dig> our group  <cit> , independently with h. a. erlich’s group  <cit> , demonstrated the feasibility of hla typing using  <dig> sequencing for the first time. a double blinded multi-center study based on exon amplification by fusion primers was conducted and published in  <dig>  <cit> . this joint study revealed that while  <dig> sequencing allows for reliable hla genotype identification, it is a time-consuming, labor-intensive workflow requiring automation. in addition, a systematic algorithm for hla class i typing was made available using different pcr-based barcoding methods  <cit> . most recently, lank s. m. and colleagues  <cit>  provided a cdna protocol for hla genotyping with a reduced complexity concerning library preparation. and finally, in contrast to amplicon sequencing, it has been demonstrated that shotgun sequencing using long-range pcr products, fragmentation and multiplex identifier  ligation is a feasible way to define the entire gene sequence of the hla molecules  <cit> .

nevertheless, the published protocols provide further evidence that next-generation sequencing is a difficult hand-to-use technology and seems inapplicable for laboratories working in the field of histocompatibility and immunogenetics. there are unresolved technical issues concerning high workloads for library preparation and overlong processing times. importantly, bioinformatics at the back-end of the ngs workflow rarely generate a readable hla typing report, however, an indispensable prerequisite from a medical point of view.

with this in mind, we developed an automated high-resolution hla typing approach suitable for diagnostic use applying a  <dig> gs junior, capturing  <dig> exons of hla-a, -b, -c, -dqb <dig>  -dpb <dig>  -drb <dig>  -drb <dig>  -drb <dig> and -drb <dig> . in conclusion, the system was validated extensively under routine conditions in accordance with established policies and procedures  of the european federation for immunogenetics .

RESULTS
sequencing performance
the validation panel consisted of  <dig> samples, analysed in  <dig> gs junior runs. the average raw well count for all runs, defined as picotiterplate  wells with measurable signal intensity during a sequencing run, was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . during the validation study we obtained an average passed filter read count of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per run with a median read length of 425 bp ±  <dig>  in total,  <dig> % ±  <dig>  of the internal control sequences had no sequencing error over a length of 400 bp with 98% accuracy. bead enrichment with the robotic enrichment module  was stable with enrichment rates for the short pool of  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  for the pool with long amplicons. mixed rates, indicating a non-clonal empcr with beads carrying more than one dna copy, were measured with  <dig> % ±  <dig>  .

boxplots of raw amplicon reads of the libraries, which refer to sequence reads filtered by an exact primer or multiplex identifier sequence  match, are shown in figure  <dig>  the median read count per amplicon in the presented study ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> with the exception of hla-b exon  <dig>  hla-c exon  <dig>   <dig> and drb exon  <dig>  the short exon  <dig> and  <dig> amplicons with a median read count of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were reduced due to a downscaled pooling scheme to compensate the higher pcr efficiency in the emulsion pcr. likewise, the pooling factor for drb exon  <dig>  was increased to generate more reads because a number of loci are co-amplified using this generic primer set.

genotype analysis by conexio atf
for genotype assignment, the raw reads were imported via .fna file into the atf software. figure  <dig> gives an estimation of the continuous sequence loss from the imported raw reads up to the sequence reads used for the final allele assignment. the atf software aligns the forward and reverse reads for each exon to the reference sequence in the “master layer” following automatic genotype assignment using an integrated allele database. allele calling takes approximately 2–3 minutes  using a standard workstation running windows  <dig> . failed reads, derived from co-amplified genes  or sequences with pcr or sequencing errors are sorted out by the software into the “failed layer” and these reads do not contribute to the final typing result. however, reads from the layers can be moved in both directions. in addition, the software allows deactivation and trimming of sequence reads generally used to exclude relatively rare sequences from the analysis.

allele assignment performance
from a total of  <dig>  loci to be analysed we were able to generate  <dig>   initial successful typing results using the novel ngs assay. allele calling of  <dig>  loci was impossible by insufficient read counts. ngs genotyping showed no mistyping compared to the sanger sequencing results. in case of drb <dig>  we identified that the amplification of exon  <dig> in the groups drb3* <dig> and * <dig> was inadequate leading to uncertain results . the performance of the ngs hla assay, broken down by number of typing per locus and accordance rates, is summarised in table  <dig>  additionally, re-runs of the previously failed loci were successful. typing results generated by the atf software for hla-a, -b, -c, -drb <dig>  -dqb <dig> and -dpb <dig> are listed in additional file  <dig>  the validation panel contained  <dig>  homozygote genotypes and was compiled to cover almost all main groups across all loci. moreover, the panel included rare alleles, null-alleles, not annotated genotypes and infrequent haplotypes to evaluate the clinical performance of the hla assay. two new alleles derived from samples of a proficiency program were correctly typed by ngs and showed the novel nucleotide variation in both sequencing directions with high coverage. in addition, the non-expressed alleles hla-a*74:12 n  and hla-b*18:23 n  were called properly by atf. out of  <dig>  genotypes,  <dig>  were called reliable without further editing. in  <dig> % of the cases , manual editing of the ngs result was required. for instance, to identify hla-c*03:04: <dig>  only when in combination with hla-c*03:03:01: <dig>  it was necessary to move the sequence reads from the “failed layer” to the “master layer” in atf software. this is a known issue described previously  <cit>  and recently solved with the new atf version  <dig> . . furthermore, sequencing of hla-c* <dig> alleles showed normally a c homopolymer with  <dig> bases at the beginning of exon  <dig> but occasionally this stretch was not sequenced correctly in reverse direction. however, this position can be corrected by manual editing with high safety through existing error free forward sequence reads.

number of total ngs typings per locus is shown next to the number of initial successful ngs typings. a typing was initial successful if a result could be generated in the atf software. sanger typing results from the validation panel were available for all loci with few exceptions. an initial correct ngs typing could be only scored if a valid reference sanger typing was available. no generated ngs result was wrong compared to the reference typing.

in general, drb <dig> genotyping was mainly conclusive with the exception of some challenging homozygote samples. in these rare cases manual editing was needed by incorrect allocation of a low number of sequence reads of co-amplified pseudogenes  or pcr artefacts formed through in vitro recombination between drb <dig> and drb3/4/ <dig>  these recently described pcr crossover sequences  <cit>  can only be seen with technologies using high sequencing depths. some recombinant sequences correspond to annotated alleles in the imgt/hla database and it is still not clear if the assigned sequences are pcr artefacts or true alleles. nevertheless, the drb <dig> locus can be analysed successfully by deactivation of such sequence reads identified by drb3/4/ <dig> specific sequence motifs.

reduction of hla ambiguity by ngs
to estimate the ambiguity resolution of this newly developed gs hla assay, we defined ambiguity strings quantitatively at the  <dig> digit level  of sanger sequencing results versus clonal ngs results. the mean ambiguity reduction for the analysed loci was  <dig> %. numbers of ambiguities per locus and typing strategy are given in figure  <dig>  except drb3/4/ <dig>  there was no significant improvement for drb <dig>  drb <dig> and drb <dig> typing compared to sanger sequencing. the highest ambiguity reduction was found for hla-dqb <dig>  and hla-b . additionally, for hla-a and hla-c the ambiguities were greatly reduced by about  <dig> %, and  <dig> % respectively, using clonal sequencing. the loci drb <dig>  and dpb <dig>  ranked at the end with a slightly reduced benefit concerning ambiguity reduction justified by a group-specific sanger-based drb <dig> approach and the lack of exon  <dig> sequence information for dpb <dig> in both assays. to meet the defined efi standards for high-resolution typing, we re-analysed selected samples with a new release of the atf software  enabling the analysis of introns to exclude some more null alleles . the new version made it possible to rule out the following alleles: hla-a*01:01:01:02 n , hla-a*03:01:01:02 n , hla-29:01:01:02 n  and hla-b*15:01:01:02 n . a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> non-expressed variants  can be currently  identified using this novel ngs hla assay. exon  <dig> typing of hla-a is not implemented at the moment due to a reduced frequency of a* <dig> alleles  in our population; therefore we cannot exclude hla-a*68:11 n. furthermore, a single base substitution at the end of exon  <dig> leading to drb1*03:68 n is located at the 3’ primer binding site of the generic reverse primer of drb, so this null allele is not excludable. these both non-expressed and clinical significant alleles must be addressed by sanger sequencing during verification typing.

discussion
recently introduced next-generation sequencing platforms have the potential to facilitate high-resolution hla genotyping in the forthcoming period through a general reduction of phase ambiguities, while extending the regions to be sequenced. using the sequencing capacity of these technologies, it is possible to sequence the entire major histocompatibility complex   <cit>  in order to discover hidden transplantation determinants. on the other hand, in the near future, sequencing of the total human exome could become a state-of-the-art technique for deciphering genetic variations affecting the outcome of hsct. however, at this time, exclusively classical transplantation antigens are defined routinely in accordance with the applicable requirements provided by the associated societies. so far, the definition of hla-a, -b, -c,  -drb <dig>  and -dqb <dig>  at 4-digit level is currently used for related and unrelated donor selection. the clinical relevance of using sequence information outside the peptide binding site, or at higher resolution  in terms of alloreactivity still remains unknown except in variations in the coding or non-coding regions leading to null alleles characterised by a lack of hla expression on the cell surface  <cit> . to exclude non-expressed alleles, extended typing of hla-a , hla-b  and hla-c  is necessary and effectively demonstrated in this study.

the advantage of this gs hla typing assay compared to recently published shotgun protocols relies on scalability through the use of relevant exon sequence information, therefore saving sequencing capacity. analysing large or full genomic regions of each hla gene will flood the imgt/hla database in the near future and the only argument for it is that it has the ability to discover very rare null alleles. an attempt to completely analyse non-coding regions of hla alleles would be challenging not only due to missing intronic sequences of the broad majority of the annotated alleles, but because it would be disproportionate to the intended objective. nevertheless, the discussion remains ongoing.

applying the gs junior a large number of sequence reads did not pass quality criteria and was rejected by the system, rendering it unusable. similarly, approximately 35% of the raw reads did not pass the atf software due to errors. consequently, a substantial sequence loss has to be taken into account. using this exon-based sequencing approach, it is extremely important to avoid imbalanced conditions between exons. underrepresentation of sequences is not a relevant problem in our assay and is usually solved by introducing a scaling factor at the amplicon pooling step. interestingly, using shotgun sequencing variability in read depth across the region is an issue affected by the fragmentation process and read length  <cit> . generally, an allele dropout due to preferential amplification refers to all currently available protocols and is ruled out by pcr optimisation and extensive validation, as shown in this work. most notably, long-range pcr might be more susceptible to allele dropout. targeting many hla regions by multiple pcrs enhances safety by identifying heterozygous positions, although fusion primer strategies require increased mid validation efforts. in conclusion, inadequate sequence coverage is a well-known reason for dropout of alleles . in this study the average read count was  <dig> per amplicon, leading to reliable typing results and reasonable costs per sample. coverage is an important factor and must therefore be specified carefully based on validation data.

moreover, reliable typing results depend on dna quality, which is still a critical factor in routine laboratories. the use of rna for the definition of hla loci reduces the library construction dramatically, but clinical samples are often not suitable for cdna preparation and the exclusion of null alleles characterised by intonic variations is not possible. the problem likewise arises when using long-range pcr requiring intact, high-quality genomic dna for secure amplification. for clinical laboratories, the complex workflow is a major drawback as it often allows for human errors. for instance, sample mix-up during pcr setup or library processing was successfully solved in this study through the automation of the workflow. further issues, including occasionally observed sequence-specific errors - also identified in non-homopolymer motifs - are still quite difficult to handle. thus, it is mandatory to sequence in forward and reverse direction when using ngs, similarly as implemented in generic sanger sequencing.

 <dig> sequencing is reaching the longest reads length to date and we demonstrated that we were able to obtain phased exon sequence information from nearly all selected regions. generally, phase ambiguities rise frequently in conserved regions or sequences with a reduced incidence of widely spaced snps and cannot be excluded by the currently developed methods. in our case, phase definition across 425 bp of each single read is feasible. ambiguities may occur when the phase between exons cannot be defined, based on hla alleles generated by exon shuffling. however, these exemptions are indeed rare and could not be identified in our validation panel. by implementing the new atf  <dig>  version phasing is further improved by inclusion of polymorphic sites located in the intron. as expected, new developments in this field are still ongoing and already realised by a sequencing length of 700 bp using the flx + version. new protocols reaching very long reads will be available in the near future even for the gs junior.

due to the use of liquid handling robots, we were able to type six hla loci of ten samples within  <dig>  days with the gs junior. using a reduced primer panel  to reach the minimal requirements for high-resolution typing, frequently termed as intermediate resolution typing, increases the throughput to twenty samples per gs junior run. this application is ideally suitable for registry typing, cordblood typing or donor search in families, but also more cost-effective than traditional low-resolution typing techniques used in our laboratory. by the use of the gs flx we are able to scale-up the throughput to  <dig>  respectively  <dig> samples per run using a four region gasket.

CONCLUSIONS
a typical tissue typing laboratory needs to be flexible, providing hla typing results within a short turnaround time and notably without fail. from this perspective we developed, validated and implemented a next-generation sequencing hla approach using  <dig> sequencing. our primary aim was to eliminate the major outstanding obstacles in the ngs workflow to ensure a smooth daily typing routine. the presented study demonstrates that this novel hla ngs assay performs with 100% reliability and is particularly suitable for unrelated donor hla typing, according to the policies of the efi. the workflow fits very well in medium- and high-throughput typing laboratories and could become attractive for donor registries. ngs seems to become one of the new methods in the field of histocompatibility and immunogenetics.
