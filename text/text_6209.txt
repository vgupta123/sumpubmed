BACKGROUND
metazoan mitochondrial dna  is generally a small molecule , and although much larger mitochondrial genomes have occasionally been found, they are often products of duplications of mtdna portions, rather than variations in gene content  <cit> . the typical mitochondrial gene complement encodes  <dig> protein subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation enzymes,  <dig> rrnas and  <dig> trnas. however, the coding sequences  can be up to  <dig>  the trnas up to  <dig> , and the rrnas can be duplicated and/or fragmented in discontinuous genes, as in oysters  <cit> . generally, there is also a single large non-coding region that is known to contain regulatory elements for replication and transcription , but it is unclear whether it is homologous among distantly related animals or, alternatively, it independently arose from various non-coding sequences. this difficulty in establishing homology is because crs share sequence similarity only among closely related taxa. finally, the mtdna is almost always a circular molecule: only the cnidarian classes cubozoa, scyphozoa and hydrozoa have been found to have linear mtdna chromosomes  <cit> . all metazoan mitochondrial genes have homologs in plants, fungi and/or protists  <cit> .

the mollusca is the second largest animal phylum and currently  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes are available in genbank; among those, only  <dig> are from bivalvia, the second class in terms of species richness among mollusks. so far, bivalve mtdna displays an extraordinary amount of variation in gene arrangement, i.e. very few shared gene boundaries are detectable, and gene translocations are common across all gene classes . for this reason, bivalve mitochondrial genome may provide an excellent experimental system to review and test models of mt gene rearrangement evolution, which were mainly developed in groups with stable genomes, such as vertebrates or arthropods. in addition, gene duplications and/or losses are present in almost every bivalve taxon in which a complete mitochondrial genome is available . it is therefore evident that efforts should be made to improve the knowledge of bivalve mitochondrial genomes.

another interesting feature of bivalve mtdna is its unusual transmission route, which is found in some species: while in metazoa mtdna is known to be usually transmitted by strict maternal inheritance , some bivalve mollusks show a deviation from this rule, named doubly uniparental inheritance . dui was found in species belonging to seven different bivalve families: donacidae, hyriidae, margaritiferidae, mytilidae, solenidae, unionidae, and veneridae . species with dui are characterized by the presence of two distinct gender-associated mtdnas: one transmitted through eggs  and one transmitted through sperm . the f and m genomes show up to 52% nucleotide divergence  <cit> . dui seems at first to violate the universal rule of uniparental inheritance of organelles, because males receive their mtdna from both parents and their tissues are heteroplasmic. however the two mtdnas segregate independently: the f-type is transmitted to the next generation only through females, while the m-type is only transmitted from father to sons, therefore both genomes are actually transmitted uniparentally.

because of its unique features, dui should be a choice model to address many aspects of a wide range of biological sub-fields such as mitochondria inheritance, mtdna evolution and recombination, genomic conflicts, evolution of sex and developmental biology .

recently, evidence for a new example of dui was found in the mytilid musculista senhousia  <cit> . in this work we characterized the two sex-linked mitochondrial genomes of m. senhousia, a step forward to the complete genetic characterization of dui related sex-linked mitochondrial genomes. in fact, several unusual features are coming to light when analyzing mtdnas in dui systems, such as additional protein coding genes  and gene duplications/features  <cit> . functional explanations for these features will require much additional work, but are needed to understand the evolution and maintenance of dui.

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome features in m. senhousia
the obtained m. senhousia mtdnas are  <dig>  bp long in female  and  <dig>  bp in male  . sequences are available in genbank . the size of both f and m mitochondrial genomes are within the size range of mollusk mtdnas sequenced to date, i.e. from  <dig> bp in batilaria cumingi to  <dig>  bp in placopecten magellanicus .

m. senhousia f and m gene arrangements are remarkably different from other fully sequenced metazoan mtdnas . genome annotations are reported in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  table  <dig> and  <dig>  when compared to other mytilidae, only four gene boundaries are shared with mytilus , i.e. rrns-nad <dig>  nad2-cox <dig>  nad4l-nad <dig> and nad3-cox <dig>  while the rest of the genome is different, thus highlighting that gene arrangement evolves rapidly within the family.

comparing the two sex linked genomes, protein-coding genes may have different lengths . both f-type and m-type include a large number of unassigned regions . among these, the largest  are here referred as lurs .

ur = unassigned regions.

na = not available.

pd = p-distance.

se = standard error.

*: pd between mcox <dig> and mcox2b genes.

#: mcox2b gene was excluded from the computation of overall pd.

both f and m mt genomes show the same gene order and contain the full gene complement of the typical metazoan mtdna, with two additional trnas: trnm and trnl . in males the cox <dig> gene is duplicated .

the atp <dig> gene was reported as missing in several bivalve mollusks, however, as recently reported  <cit> , the lack of atp <dig> would rather be an annotation inaccuracy due to the extreme variability of the gene. following  <cit> , we found an atp <dig> gene in m. senhousia in both m and f genomes.

the position of the two ribosomal rna genes, obtained through blast comparison, does not differ between male and female. in both sexes, rrnl is located in a region flanked by the trnm and nad <dig> genes. assuming that the first base at the 5'-end comes immediately after the trnm, and the 3'-end of the gene corresponds to the first base upstream of the start codon of nad <dig> gene, the length of the rrnl genes are remarkably different: the male rrnl  is  <dig> bp longer than the female one . the rrns gene is located in a region flanked by trns and nad <dig> genes and, as above, we assumed that the first base at the 5'-end comes immediately after trng, and that the 3'-end of the gene corresponds to the first base upstream of the start codon of nad <dig> gene. here, the difference in length is reduced to  <dig> bp: the female rrns gene is  <dig> bp long while the male one is  <dig>  bp.

f and m genomes of m. senhousia contain  <dig> trna genes . as observed in mtdna of some other mollusks , two leucine trna genes are present in m. senhousia. these can be differentiated by their anticodons: taa for trnl and tag for trnl, which are 2-fold and 4-fold redundant respectively. consequently, tnrl is 6-fold redundant. an additional trnm was also detected, as in v. philippinarum, mytilus species complex, crassostrea gigas, c. hongkongensis and c. virginica. the additional trna coding for methionine, trnm, has the tat anticodon.

in both male and female mtdnas, trns have a shortened dhu  that is not atypical, as this arm is unpaired in many metazoan taxa  <cit> . moreover, mispairing between bases in stems is consistent across several taxa. for example, the second base pair in the anticodon stem of trnw has a t-t mispairing in lampsilis ornata, mytilus, and k. tunicata and a t-g pairing in several gastropods  <cit> .

in the f mitochondrial genome of musculista,  <dig> out of  <dig> trna genes are clustered in five groups of two to six . of the remaining two, trnt lies between atp <dig> and the 5'-end of cob genes  while trna lies between nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes. thus,  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes  have a trna preceding their 5'-end. in contrast,  <dig> other genes  have a non-coding sequence at their 5'-end that is capable of forming a stem and loop structure .

in male mitochondrial dna,  <dig> of the  <dig> trna genes are clustered in five groups ranging from two to six . of the remaining three, trnt lies between atp <dig> and the 5'-end of cob genes , trna lies between nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes and trne lies between the large unassigned region  and the 5'-end of cox <dig> gene. thus,  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes  have a trna preceding their 5'-end, while  <dig> other genes  have a non-coding sequence preceding their 5'-end that is capable of forming a stem and loop structure . in a few cases those structures contain the translation initiation codon .

the nucleotide compositions of the two genomes are summarized in table  <dig>  given the g content of the f and m coding strand , this can be considered as the heavy  strand of the molecule. the a+t content of the h strand is also high . variable values of a+t content are common in mollusks, and they have been reported in l. ornata , pupa strigosa , and c. nemoralis . in other mollusks, the a+t content is much higher . musculista values in a+t content are among the highest observed in the phylum, and reflect the high heterogeneity of molluscan mtdna  <cit> . moreover, there is a marked bias in favor of t against c, which is not restricted to any particular class of genes and does not differ between the two genomes.

the gc and at asymmetry between the two mitochondrial dna strands can be expressed in terms of gc skew and at skew calculated according to  <cit> : gc skew = / and at skew = /, where g, c, a, and t are the occurrences of the four bases in the h strand. in m. senhousia f and m mitochondrial genomes, the gc skew and the at skew are f: + <dig>  and - <dig> , and m: + <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively.

in the m. senhousia male mtdna  <dig> out of  <dig> protein genes start with the ata codon and  <dig> with atg, while in the female  <dig> out of  <dig> start with atg and  <dig> with ata . this pattern differs from that observed for mytilus galloprovincialis, where  <dig> out of  <dig> protein genes start with the atg codon,  <dig> with the ata and  <dig> with gtg  <cit> . in all known metazoan mtdnas, the most common start codon is atg, and it is a general opinion that the methionine trna with the cat anticodon represents the ancestral form. moreover  <cit>  suggested that the second methionine trna arose by duplication. the f and m genomes of the venerid venerupis philippinarum also have two trna genes for methionine, but both have the ancestral cat anticodon. taa is the termination codon ten times in f and nine times in m mtdna, while tag is a stop codon two times in f, and four times in m. in both m and f genomes, nad <dig> gene is terminated by an incomplete termination codon t-- , with their likely completion occurring by polyadenylation after transcript processing  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acids residues are encoded by male and female m. senhousia mitochondrial genome respectively . all codons do occur in both musculista mitochondrial genomes . uuu  is the most frequent codon, followed by uua . uuu is also the most frequent codon in m. galloprovincialis  <cit> , in l. ornata  <cit>  and in c. nemoralis  <cit> , whereas uua  is most common in a. coerulea  <cit> , p. strigosa  <cit> , roboastra europaea  <cit> , g. eborea  <cit> , and k. tunicata  <cit> . these two codons are also the most frequently used in other invertebrate mtdnas  <cit> . uuu is also very frequent in basal chordates , but not in most vertebrates, where cua  or auu  are the most frequent.

pd = p-distances at the amino acidic level.

ka/ks = ratio values between ka and ks.

codons that match the corresponding trna anticodon are bold and underlined.

s.c.: stop codon.

the least used codons in males are ucg , ccg  and cgg , while in females they are ccg , cgc  and uag . of these, cgc is also among the least common in the mtdna of other mollusks. synonymous codons, whether four-fold  or two-fold  degenerate, are recognized by the same trna, with the exception of the methionine codons, which are recognized by different trnas .

moreover,  <dig>  f and  <dig>  m musculista codons  end with an a or t, a more pronounced phenomenon than what observed for a typical invertebrate codon bias. there is a strong bias against the use of c  at the third position nucleotide in all codons: in detail, for residues with a fourfold degenerate third position, codon families ending with t are the most frequently used . this is also the case for two-fold degenerate codons. in other words, in every case an amino acid residue can be specified by any nny codon, both female and male m. senhousia mitochondrial genomes have a much higher proportion of nnt:nnc. in fact, female showed  <dig> % of t and  <dig> % of c, with nnt:nnc ratio of  <dig> :1; while in male the ratio's value is slightly lower:  <dig> : <dig> . at the second position, there is even a stronger bias in favor of the use of t usage , like in m. edulis , c. hongkongensis , c. gigas  and c. virginica .

finally, in eight 2fd and seven 4fd codon families in females and in seven 2fd and seven 4fd codon families in males, the most frequently used codon does not match the trna anticodon. this has been observed in other metazoan mtdna as well  <cit>  and it suggests that strict codon-anticodon complementarity does not affect the codon composition of the genome. deviations from equal frequency of the four nucleotides in 4fd sites are common in the animal mtdna and have been attributed to several factors, such as unequal presence of the four nucleotides in the nucleotide pool, preference of the mitochondrial gamma dna polymerase for specific nucleotides, or asymmetrical mutation rate owing to different duration of exposure of the lagging strand during replication  <cit> .

comparing the two m. senhousia sex linked genomes, the most conserved protein-coding genes are cox <dig> and cob, and the least conserved are nad <dig> and atp <dig> . synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution values between the two genomes do vary . ka is particularly low for cox <dig> , whereas ks is not , suggesting that this gene is under some selective constraint . the conservation of cox <dig> is common in animal mtdna  <cit> . in cob gene, both k values are lower than average  with a ka/ks ratio's value  which is close to that of cox <dig> gene.

the large unassigned region 
as mentioned, in the female genome the lur  is  <dig>  bp long and it is included between trne and the 5'-end of cox <dig> gene , while in the male it  is  <dig>  bp long, and included between trnn and trne genes . both start with a dissimilar sequence/spacer  <dig> and  <dig> bp long, respectively.

the f-lur contains two large repeats  about  <dig>  bp long , both subdividable in three regions: a, b and c . between rep <dig> and rep <dig>  the a subregion is the most conserved  while c is the most variable, although with a low pd . overall, rep <dig> and rep <dig> have a pd of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the region including the last  <dig> bp of the f-lur shows some similarity  to the a subregions , for this reason it is indicated here as subregion a'.

all the a-type subregions  start with a  <dig> bp conserved motif, named here α, that contains a  <dig> bp hairpin . both the subunits c  begin with a hairpin  <dig> bp long . the m-lur contains an a-like subregion showing a pd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from a <dig> and a <dig> , indicated as a'' . a'' starts with a  <dig> bp motif, here named α*, similar to α, but  <dig> bp shorter and with three mutations that allow the formation of a longer hairpin, here named α*h , in comparison to the female hairpin αh. the m-lur continues with the subunit b that is the most conserved region compared to the f-lur showing a pd from b <dig> and b <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively . at the 3' end of b there is a motif, indicated as γ  that is similar to the first part of the subunits c. γ is repeated four times in tandem. the length of γ <dig>  γ <dig> and γ <dig> ranges from  <dig> and  <dig> bp while the last repeat, γ <dig>  is truncated and measures  <dig> bp . the pd among the γ motifs is low and ranges from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the female  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  between γ <dig> and γ <dig> . the pd of the γ motifs between male and female varies from  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . at the 5' end of each γ motif a secondary structure is present : γ1h is  <dig> bp long, while the other three are  <dig> bp long. γ2h and γ3h are identical, γ4h has a two bases mutation at the center of the loop and γ1h is identical to the upper portion of γ4h .

furthermore, in line with what has been found in other dui bivalves, including mytilus, an orf coding for  <dig> amminoacids has been found in the f-lur of m. senhousia. this protein was proposed to have a functional role in dui. detailed analyses on this novel dui related putative protein have been published in a more comparative way .

the cox <dig> duplication in the male mtdna
the male mtdna contains an extra copy of the cox <dig> gene. this is not new for dui animals, since the female mt genome of the marine clam v. philippinarum has a cox <dig> duplication as well .

in the female musculista, the cox <dig> gene  is  <dig> bp long and is flanked by the "cox1/ur-6" and "ur-7/atp8" regions at the 5'- and 3'-end respectively . in male mitochondrial genome, the two copies of cox <dig> are close to each other and linked by a little non coding region  <dig> bp long . the two cox <dig> copies are located between "cox1/ur-5" and "ur-7/atp8" regions, and the first is  <dig> bp long, while the second is  <dig> bp long .

bayesian phylogenetic analyses on fcox <dig>  mcox <dig>  mcox <dig> genes and their homologous in mytilus species, demonstrated that fcox <dig> is more closely related to the shorter mcox <dig> , rather than to the longer one . for this reason, the  <dig> bp long mcox <dig> seems to be an extra copy of the gene, and thus it is referred here as mcox2b.

discussion
gene content and order of f and m mitochondrial genomes in m. senhousia
in m. senhousia both m and f mtdnas share the same gene content and order, except for a duplicated cox <dig> gene in males, and include the typical gene content of bivalve mtdna. it has to be noted, however, that a common feature of bivalves is the apparent lack of the atp <dig> gene. for instance,  <cit>  mentioned that a lack of the atp <dig> gene is one of several unusual features of the mytilus mt sequence. the atp <dig> gene was considered missing for almost all bivalve species studied so far, including crassostrea hongkongensis, c. gigas, c. virginica, placopecten magellanicus, argopecten irradians, mizuhopecten yessoensis and acanthocardia tuberculata. on the contrary, the apt <dig> gene was found in hiatella arctica, as well as in the female mitochondrial genome of the unionid bivalve l. ornata  <cit> . a remarkable observation is that v. philippinarum, another species with dui  <cit> , was recently found to contain a putative atp <dig> gene  <cit> , which was not found in the first analyses; nonetheless, this gene apparently encodes  <dig> amino acids only and therefore has a questionable gene function. finally,  <cit>  examined orfs from several bivalve mitochondrial genomes and found two novel orfs  in the largest unassigned region of f and m mytilid ones . blastn searches against est_others  showed that both are transcribed in mytilus spp. blastx and psi-blast searches using inferred aminoacid sequences of f-orf-ur <dig> and m-orf-ur <dig> failed to detect any significant sequence similarity with known proteins, so the identity of those putative proteins is still unclear. further analyses on structure and evolution patterns suggested that the novel orfs "represent good candidates for the previously 'missing' atp <dig> in mytilid mtdnas"  <cit> . therefore, following  <cit> , we also found atp <dig> putative genes in both sex-linked mitochondrial genomes of m. senhousia. our atp <dig> genes share the same characteristics of the above mentioned proteins, so we are confident to annotate them as musculista atp <dig> genes.

generally speaking, most mtdnas are characterized by strand asymmetry in term of gene distribution. in both m. senhousia mt genomes, all genes are transcribed from the same strand, i.e. the asymmetry is at its highest among metazoa. most marine bivalves also share this feature . in contrast, this is not true for the two freshwater species l. ornata  <cit>  and inversidens japanensis  . in other mollusks, a relatively small number of mitochondrial genes are transcribed from the second strand. the scaphopods g. eborea and s. lobatum are an exception, with about an equal number of genes encoded by each strand  <cit> . the occurrence of all genes in the same strand is a relatively rare phenomenon in metazoans and, in addition to bivalves, it has been reported in some annelids  and brachiopods . actually, almost 10% of the mitochondrial genomes examined to date do have all genes encoded in the same strand  <cit> . moreover, most of the above mentioned groups, including bivalvia, are also characterized by strong differences in gene content and/or gene order. this allowed  <cit>  to suggest a possible correlation between these two features.

the trns could not be located with trnascan-se  <cit>  because of the absence of the dhu arm and therefore of a normal cloverleaf structure , so we used the arwen software  <cit>  to identify it. this unconventional trna was found also in several other animal groups , and it evolved very early in metazoa  <cit> . in vitro analyses confirmed its functionality  <cit> .

in table  <dig>  the distribution of trns and trns among bivalves is reported . most of the species  have both the trnas,  <dig> only trns and  <dig>  only trns. placopecten magellanicus have two copies of trns, while mizuhopecten yessoensis seems to lack a serine trna.  <cit>  suggested that the secondary structure of a trna gene between a pair of protein genes is responsible for the precise cleavage of the polycistronic primary transcript. in the absence of a trna, this role can be played by a stem-loop structure, the 5'-end part of the gene itself, or a combination of the two. potential hairpin structures at protein-protein gene junctions with no intervening trna have been reported in several studies . our analysis demonstrated that putative hairpins are present in all the gene junctions in which a trna lacks, suggesting a functional role of such intergenic sequences .

*: placopecten magellanicus has two copies of trns

note: only species with complete mitochondrial genomes available included.

the large unassigned region  and the sex-linked mt-dna transmission
the structure of the f and m lur palindromes found are reported on figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the presence of palindromes within a mtdna cr is not new; in fact, the local fold symmetry created by the palindrome is thought to provide the site for dna-binding proteins involved in the trascriptional machinery  <cit> . in more detail, palindromic motifs  have the potential to form single-stranded stem-loop cruciform structures which have been reported to be essential for replication of circular genomes in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems  <cit> . the redundancy of palindromic elements in the musculista male lur, when compared to that of the female, may be possibly related to an increased duplication ratio of the m mtdna; we can also speculate that this feature may have some role in the process by which sperm mitochondrial dna becomes dominant or exclusive of the male germline, although we know that this is also achieved through a differential segregation during early embryo development, and likely through a second, more strict, selection during primordial germ cells establishment . nevertheless, the question of how sperm mitochondrial dna becomes dominant or the exclusive component of the male germline in dui species still remains open, and may be the outcome of various coordinated processes.

the duplication of the cox <dig> gene
one noteworthy finding of this analysis is the cox <dig> gene duplication in the male mtdna, with the duplicated gene being longer than the original one, a feature that might be somehow related to dui. in fact, an interesting analogy is evident with unionid bivalves, in which the male cox <dig> gene show a 200-codon extension, which is absent in the female mtdna. such a feature is found in all analyzed unionids so far, and it has been related to dui functioning  <cit> . actually,  <cit>  proposed several hypotheses for the role the cox <dig> extension may have for dui, but all are dependent upon identifying a specific function for it, which is not a trivial task. moreover, they detected in the male gonad a poly-adenylated mrna transcript of the cox <dig> gene that includes the extension, and they concluded that the extension is protein-coding and functional.

 <cit>  also hypothesized that the cox <dig> protein extension might be involved in intracellular interactions determining the survival of the male mitochondrion. in other organisms, it has been shown that upon fertilization the sperm-derived mitochondria are targeted for elimination: a key process in sperm mitochondrial degradation is ubiquitination  <cit> , in which mitochondria of paternal derivation are tagged with ubiquitin and then degraded. in mytilus, in which an ubiquitin-like process has been proposed, this degradation would be sex-specific: the sperm-derived mitochondria survive in male embryos, whereas they are eliminated in females. all that considered,  <cit>  proposed that the cox <dig> extension could be involved in blocking such elimination to ensure survival of the male mitochondrion, or, alternatively, the extension could play a role in the segregation of male mitochondria to the gonad. in either case, it should be possible to detect the protein product of the extension outside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. an in situ hybridization seemed to demonstrate that the unionid male cox <dig> is present on both inner and outer membranes of the sperm mitochondria .

according to the above mentioned rationales, we hypothesize that the duplicated cox2b gene in male m. senhousia may represent a variant of what found in unionoidean bivalves, with proper signals for dui mitochondrial tagging lying in the cox <dig> protein extension of unionid bivalves, as well as in the duplicated cox2b protein of musculista. a support to this view comes from the observation that an additional putative trans membrane helix  is found in the  <dig> residue long tail of the musculista cox2b, although this tail is considerably shorter that the unionid one . actually, five putative tmhs were found in the unionid extended c-terminus of the male cox <dig>  which led the authors to hypothesize that it may have a functional significance for male unionoidean bivalve reproductive success  <cit> .

in analogy, we suggest that cox2b might have some function related to mitochondrial tagging, like the cox2b and the unionid cox <dig> extension. further studies are needed to gain a more clear role of such proteins in the unusual dui system of mitochondrial inheritance. actually, a duplication similar to the musculista one was also found in v. philippinarum, but quite surprisingly in the female mtdna . this suggests that cox <dig> duplication may be uncoupled with maleness. moreover, no mytilus genomes show a similar situation for cox <dig> or any other gene, so either duplicated genes or a cox <dig> tail may not be strictly necessary to sustain dui.

CONCLUSIONS
the characteristics of the musculista sex-linked mtdnas evidently add to the knowledge of dui systems, and highlight some unexpected features, shared among distantly related dui species. since it is commonly accepted that dui is rather a variation of strict maternal inheritance, than a completely different mechanism, we think that dui is a good experimental model to better understand the general rules, as well as the molecular features of metazoan mitochondrial inheritance . for the above mentioned reasons, the complete mtdna genome characterization of dui bivalves is not only a mere descriptive exercise, but rather a first step to unravel the complex genetic signals allowing doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial dna, and the evolutionary implications of such unusual transmission route in mitochondrial genome evolution in bivalvia.
