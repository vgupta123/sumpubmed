BACKGROUND
the adaptation of pathogens to the host environment is a critical determinant of the outcome of disease. well-documented examples include antigenic variation in parasites and fungi to evade adaptive immune responses, viral evasion of immune detection, and phase variation in bacterial pathogens  <cit> . for fungi that attack humans, accumulating evidence indicates that genomic plasticity also contributes to adaptation to the host. for example, surveys of clinical isolates of candida albicans reveal extensive variation in karyotypes and chromosome copy number, and genomic changes have been shown to arise during infection  <cit> . furthermore, aneuploidy is common in laboratory strains of c. albicans, and this trait, along with isochromosome formation, is associated with resistance to azole antifungal drugs  <cit> . genome-wide variation also occurs during infections caused by cryptococcus neoformans, the leading cause of fungal meningoencephalitis in patients with hiv/aids  <cit> . for example, fries et al.  <cit>  documented karyotypic changes and gross chromosomal rearrangements or deletions in sequential isolates from individual patients. subsequent experimental infections in mice also confirmed that karyotypic changes occur during passage in the host  <cit> .

previously, we employed comparative genome hybridization  to characterize chromosomal variations among strains of c. neoformans that differed in capsular serotypes, molecular subtypes and/or ploidy, including hybrids of different serotype  <cit> . c. neoformans generally exists as a haploid yeast in the environment and patients, although natural hybrid strains are also found and they appear to be diploid or aneuploid  <cit> . our cgh analysis of three strains of hybrid serotype  revealed that these strains were aneuploid with preferential retention of chromosome  <dig> from the serotype a genome  <cit> . this study also evaluated four clinical isolates of serotype a and identified two that were disomic for chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . strains of serotype a are responsible for the majority of clinical cases of cryptococcosis  <cit> . the two disomic clinical isolates came from aids patients in argentina  and australia . we examined these strains for the three most important virulence factors, formation of the polysaccharide capsule, deposition of melanin in the cell wall, and growth at 37°c. the strains were phenotypically similar to the standard reference strain in capsule production and growth at 37°c but they exhibited reduced formation of melanin  <cit> . this result suggested that phenotypic differences related to virulence might be correlated with variation in chromosome copy number. more recently, polyploidy has been described as a feature of c. neoformans cells in the host  <cit> .

variation in chromosome content may be more common in c. neoformans than previously recognized. in addition to the occurrence of disomy in clinical strains  <cit> , sionov et al.  <cit>  recently found that selection for growth in the presence of elevated levels of the antifungal drug fluconazole resulted in disomy. specifically, strains of c. neoformans exhibited heteroresistance in which a minor subpopulation of cells was present that could tolerate levels of the drug above the normal minimal inhibitory concentration. the resistant subpopulation represented  <dig> - <dig> % of the starting cells and cgh analysis revealed that the heteroresistant isolates were disomic for chromosome  <dig>  as well as other chromosomes  depending on the level of resistance. notably, chromosome  <dig> carries both erg <dig>  encoding lanosterol-14-α-demethylase, the target of fluconazole, and afr <dig>  encoding an abc transporter associated with susceptibility to azoles. subsequent genetic analysis confirmed a role for these genes in the association of disomy with resistance to fluconazole. sionov et al.  <cit>  proposed that fluconazole exposure may induce chromosome amplification rather than simply select for disomic strains arising by spontaneous chromosomal mis-segregation. the clinical relevance of chromosomal aberrations is further supported by other recent observations. as mentioned above, changes in genome copy number resulting in polyploidy are observed for so-called giant cells of c. neoformans arising during pulmonary infection  <cit> . in addition, desnos-ollivier et al.  <cit>  discovered that ~18% of patients have mixed infections with strains of different mating type, serotype, genotype and ploidy.

in the current study, we extended our analysis of disomy in c. neoformans by testing the hypothesis that the copy number of chromosomes affects the expression of the virulence trait melanin and the severity of disease in experimentally infected mice. the results confirmed that disomy at chromosome  <dig> is correlated with both loss of melanin formation and reduced murine virulence. however, we also discovered copy number changes for other chromosomes in strains with altered melanin formation, and the correlation with chromosome  <dig> was not always observed. the additional changes in chromosome copy number were detected by screening strains that were passaged in culture or through mice. the discovery of disomy in a clinical isolate and its influence on virulence, suggested that disomy might arise during human infections. we therefore screened a collection of clinical and environmental strains, as well as isolates obtained directly from the cerebrospinal fluid of hiv/aids patients, and we found additional examples of variation in chromosome copy number. overall, this study suggests that variation in the expression of virulence traits among strains and their ability to adapt to the mammalian host environment are influenced by changes in chromosome copy number.

RESULTS
disomy at chromosome  <dig> of c. neoformans is correlated with reduced melanin formation
in comparison to the serotype a strain h <dig>  the reference strain that is commonly used to investigate the virulence of c. neoformans, two clinical isolates, cbs <dig> and wm <dig>  were reported to have significantly diminished production of the major virulence factor melanin  <cit> . since both strains were shown by comparative genome hybridization  to be disomic for chromosome  <dig> , we hypothesized that their reduction in melanin formation was due to chromosomal variation such as disomy. we focused our subsequent work on cbs <dig> because this strain was similar in virulence to strain h <dig>  and strain wm <dig> was attenuated for virulence . to examine the relationship between melanin formation and disomy, we initially screened strain cbs <dig> for variants that showed a more pronounced defect in melanin production . these were readily identified along with black variants that formed more highly melanized colonies. this screen yielded  <dig> black isolates , and  <dig> white isolates  for further analysis. these isolates generally maintained their melanin phenotypes upon repeated streaking on l-dopa medium. each of the  <dig> black and  <dig> white melanin variants were first examined by quantitative pcr using primers for genes at three positions along chr  <dig>  to determine the copy number of the chromosome. based on the genome sequences of serotype a and d strains  <cit> , the actin gene on chr  <dig>  and a gene on chr  <dig>  were employed as a single copy controls. in addition, the smg <dig> gene on chr  <dig> was used as a control because fraser et al.  <cit>  showed that this gene was duplicated in the serotype d strain jec <dig>  but not in strain h <dig>  the pcr analysis revealed that each of the  <dig> black variants was monosomic at chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>  all  <dig> of the white variants were monsomic at chr  <dig> but nine were disomic and three were trisomic at chr  <dig> . these analyses were repeated several times on independent dna samples with identical results. the pcr results were also confirmed and extended by cgh analysis on independent dna samples that revealed monosomy for chr  <dig> in the three black variants  and disomy in the three white variants  .

quantitative pcr was used to examine copy number .

nd, not determined

in addition to a correlation between reduced melanization and disomy at chr  <dig>  we also found that white strains were more susceptible to the antifungal drug fluconazole, and to the trafficking inhibitors brefeldin a  and monensin . the latter inhibitors are relevant to virulence because we previously showed that they inhibit the secretory pathway needed for capsule formation  <cit> . in addition, several secreted enzymes contribute to virulence in c. neoformans including phospholipase b, urease and laccase  <cit> . the black and white variants exhibited no differences in capsule formation or their responses to oxidative and nitrosative stress . however, the white strains did display slower growth in liquid culture . overall, these results established a correlation between disomy at chr  <dig> and phenotypic traits with potential relevance to virulence and clinical outcome, i.e., melanin formation, secretion and susceptibility to fluconazole.

disomic, non-melanized strains have reduced virulence
the white and black variants with defined chromosomal complements provided the opportunity to determine the effect, if any, of variation in chromosome copy number on virulence in a mouse inhalation model of cryptococcosis. cells from the same cultures that were employed to isolate dna for the cgh analysis of the three white  and black  variants were also used as inoculum in the virulence assays. initially, we performed a pilot virulence test by inoculating three mice with each of the three black isolates and the three white isolates. this study also included strain h <dig> because of its well-characterized and high level of murine virulence, as well as the original cbs <dig> and wm <dig> strains. the results indicated that cbs <dig> was similar in virulence to strain h <dig>  wm <dig> was attenuated for virulence, and the white  variants were less virulent than the black  variants . these results were substantiated in a larger study that employed  <dig> mice for each variant. as shown in figure 3a, the white variants again showed reduced virulence  compared with the black variants.

infections with the black and white variants produced similar fungal burdens in the lungs and the brains of infected mice, although greater variation between mice was observed for the black variants in the brain . considering that white variants grew more slowly in culture and the black variants were more lethal, their comparable fungal loads in mice were unexpected. these results suggested that other properties besides fungal proliferation were contributing to disease, and we therefore examined lung and brain tissue by histopathology to more closely compare the infections. as shown in figure  <dig>  lungs infected with the black strain  exhibited more extensive airway remodeling compared with the lungs infected with the white strain , which showed greater damage to the lung parenchymal as indicated by thickened tissue and reduce air space. these differences in pulmonary histopathology were more pronounced at days  <dig> and  <dig> than at day  <dig> . the infections with both strains resulted in similar levels of perivascular and peribronchial inflammation . overall, the distinct virulence properties of the black and white strains are associated with differences in the type of damage observed in infected lung tissue.

disomy at chromosome  <dig> influences gene expression
a microarray comparison of the transcriptomes of the black and white isolates was performed to determine whether disomy at chr  <dig> influences gene expression . for this study, cbs <dig> isolates w <dig> and b <dig> were grown in liquid l-dopa medium for six hours and rna was prepared for hybridization. the analysis revealed that  <dig> genes were down regulated and  <dig> were up regulated by two-fold or more in the disomic w <dig> strain relative to the b <dig> strain . only two of the down-regulated genes in w <dig> were on chr  <dig>  compared with  <dig> of the up-regulated genes. chr  <dig> is  <dig>  bp in length and contains ~ <dig> annotated genes . thus, the array data indicated that 41% of the chr  <dig> genes were up regulated two-fold or more in association with disomy for this chromosome. we also examined the expression of genes on chr  <dig>  that might influence melanin formation and identified the ccc <dig> gene  as a potential candidate. walton et al.  <cit>  found that loss of ccc <dig> results in a melanin defect, and this gene encodes a transporter that may load copper onto the laccase enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of melanin. however, the expression of ccc <dig> was not substantially different between the b <dig> and w <dig> strains  and additional work will be needed to test whether this subtle difference influences melanization.

copy number variation at other chromosomes also correlates with melanin formation
to further examine the association between chromosome copy number and melanization, we plated the white strains cbs7779-w <dig> and cbs7779-w <dig> on l-dopa medium and screened for "second generation" black variants under the same conditions employed earlier for the parental strain cbs <dig>  these variants were readily detected and we used cgh to examine the complement of chromosomes in randomly selected colonies . all four of the black variants tested maintained the initial disomy at chr  <dig> that was present in the starting strains, but they were also disomic for chr  <dig> , chr  <dig>  or both chr <dig> and  <dig> . a subsequent comparison of the transcriptomes of strains w2-ba and b <dig> also revealed elevated transcription of many of the genes on chr  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the results for chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> in these strains were confirmed by qpcr . with regard to melanin formation in the strains, we hypothesize that disomy at chr  <dig> and/or chr  <dig> may have compensated for disomy at chr  <dig>  the examination of a random white colony from the starting strain w <dig> revealed that disomy at chr  <dig> was maintained and that additional changes occurred for segments of chr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

athe second generation strains are named after the starting strain followed by the color  and a letter or number designation. in the case of strains collected from mice, an m is added before the letter indicating color.

bthese chromosomes show segmental changes. note that some chromosomes show an elevated copy number but not full disomy perhaps indicating variability among cells in the population.

three second-generation white variants  from the monosomic black strain cbs7779-b <dig> were also examined and found to show changes in additional chromosomes . by cgh,  strain b1-wa had an increase in the number of copies of segments of chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>   b1-wb was disomic for chr <dig> and showed duplications of segments of chr  <dig>  chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>  and  strain b1-wc had duplications of chr  <dig>  chr  <dig> and a segment of chr  <dig>  these results and those described below indicated that changes in copy number occurred for several chromosomes and involved partial or complete chromosome duplication. in some cases, changes in melanization correlated with changes in specific chromosomes . however, the observed variation for part or all of four additional chromosomes  suggests that genome plasticity and/or other factors, such as background mutations, may also influence melanization. overall, these results indicate that changes in chromosome copy number readily occur in the cbs <dig> variants.

chromosome copy number variation is detected after passage in mice
we next tested whether passage through mice influenced the transitions from the monosomic and disomic states. initially, we examined the transition from disomy to monosomy by examining colonies recovered from the mice employed in the virulence assay with the three white strains cbs7779-w <dig>  -w <dig> and -w <dig> . to screen for melanin formation as an indicator of disomy, we determined the proportion of black variants in the starting inoculum of each strain by plating ~ <dig>  cells of each strain on l-dopa medium. the w <dig> inoculum yielded nine black colonies  and both w <dig> and w <dig> produced six . we then determined the fungal burden in the lungs and brains of each mouse  and screened ~ <dig>  colonies from each inoculated group  for black colonies. we found the following average percentages of black variants in brain  and lung  tissue: w <dig> , w <dig> , w <dig> . it appeared from these data that the percentage of black colonies recovered from the brain was lower than that recovered from the lung. this result may indicate a tissue-specific influence on the appearance of melanin variants.

from mice inoculated with the three white strains, we randomly selected  <dig> white and  <dig> black colonies and analyzed their chromosome copy numbers. analysis by qpcr revealed that nine of the white isolates and seven of the black isolates from mice were disomic for chr  <dig> . as with the in vitro analysis, this finding indicates that some strains can recover the ability to form melanin while still maintaining disomy at chr <dig>  subsequent cgh analysis of seven black colonies revealed that two had become monosomic at all chromosomes, three had retained the disomy at chr  <dig> and gained disomy for chr  <dig>  one had lost disomy at chr  <dig> but gained disomy at chr  <dig> with a segmental change in chr  <dig>  and one retained disomy at chr  <dig> with a elevated copy number of both chr  <dig> and  <dig> . these results are similar to those obtained with the second-generation black colonies from cultures , where disomy at chr  <dig> and/or chr  <dig> correlated with the restoration of melanin formation in strains originally disomic for chr  <dig>  three white colonies recovered from mice infected with white strains maintained disomy at chr  <dig> .

we also examined whether disomy at chr  <dig> arises in the host by inoculating each of six mice with ~  <dig> cells of the black strain b <dig>  the starting inoculum did not contain white variants among ~ <dig>  colonies screened prior to inoculation of mice. mice were sacrificed  <dig> days after infection and a screen of  <dig> colonies from homogenized brain tissue did not reveal any white colonies. however, a screen of ~ <dig>  colonies from lung tissue yielded  <dig> white colonies, and subsequent qpcr analysis of  <dig> of these white isolates revealed that five were disomic for chr  <dig> . in contrast, six randomly selected black colonies that arose from lung tissue were found to be monosomic for chr  <dig>  although we have not examined other chromosomes, this analysis confirmed that the transition from monosomy to disomy at chr  <dig> occurs during infection, as well as in vitro. however, it was also clear that other mechanisms besides disomy at chr  <dig>  such as the accumulation of background mutations, may result in reduced melanin production.

disomy at chromosome  <dig> occurs in a laboratory strain but does not correlate with melanin formation
the link between disomy at chr  <dig> and melanin formation was discovered in strain cbs <dig> during a survey of genome variation in serotype a strains, and it is possible that strain cbs <dig> is particularly prone to changes in chromosome copy number. to determine whether these results are strain-specific or a general property of c. neoformans, we investigated whether disomy readily occurs at chr  <dig> in a laboratory strain. we were also interested in testing whether specific chromosomes could be amplified through selection. we therefore tagged chr  <dig> in laboratory strain h <dig> by insertion of a neomycin resistance marker and then plated tagged strains on medium containing neomycin at 10x the concentration generally employed for selection of dna transformants . four tagged transformants  were plated on l-dopa medium containing neomycin at 10x the inhibitory concentration . after five days of incubation, approximately  <dig> colonies were observed on each plate. white and black colonies were identified on l-dopa medium with neomycin and the isolates were characterized for capsule formation and cell morphology . two of the white variants showed a larger cell size and two showed larger capsules, which indicated phenotypic changes beyond melanin formation. subsequent cgh analysis of four white and two black isolates revealed that only two strains, one white  and one black , had become disomic at chr  <dig>  and both of these strains also had changes at chr  <dig>  one white strain  had changes at chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>  and three strains  had no chromosome changes. the cgh results for the three strains with chromosomal changes are shown in figure  <dig>  overall, these results indicate that elevated copy number at chr  <dig> could be achieved in a laboratory strain through tagging a specific chromosome with a selectable marker. however, this approach was only partially effective, and in one strain, an elevated chr  <dig> copy number did not correlate with reduced melanin formation.

disomy is relatively rare in a collection of clinical and environmental strains
our initial examination of four serotype a strains revealed two  that were disomic at chr  <dig>  <cit> . to more widely assess the frequency of disomy, we used cgh to survey  <dig> additional clinical and environmental serotype a strains of different global origins . only two of the isolates showed chromosome copy number changes . specifically, strain a5-35- <dig> appeared to have an elevated copy number for chr  <dig>  and strain jp <dig> contained an amplified region on chr  <dig>  both have the a5/m <dig> genotype as defined by multilocus sequence typing  and amplified fragment length polymorphism  analyses  <cit> . the cgh analysis did reveal that strains a7-35- <dig> and c <dig> had a greater overall level of sequence divergence from h99; this result is consistent with the fact that these strains have a vnii molecular type compared with the vni subtype of strain h <dig>  <cit> . we previously demonstrated the ability of cgh to distinguish the three molecular types of serotype a strains, vni, vnii and vnb  <cit> . these isolates have been stored and subcultured since the time of their isolation from patients or the environment, and this prolonged period of in vitro growth in complete medium may have selected for strains with a haploid complement of chromosomes.

chromosome copy number variation is present in isolates from aids patients
we next examined whether chromosome copy number variation could be detected in isolates freshly collected from the cerebrospinal fluid of aids patients. multiple colonies were obtained upon plating cerebral spinal fluid from  <dig> patients and individual colonies from each specimen were used to prepared dna for cgh. no differences in chromosome copy number were observed for the isolates from  <dig> of the patients , rct <dig>  and rct <dig> . however, three different colonies from the patient hc <dig> had divergent patterns of hybridization on the cgh array containing the h <dig> genome, suggesting sequence heterogeneity. subsequent testing revealed that these isolates were d serotype or molecular type vniv . it is known that the genomes of a and d strains exhibit sequence divergence of 5-10%  <cit> . a divergent hybridization pattern was also noted for two colonies of patient hc <dig> , but a third colony  showed a tighter hybridization pattern; this result also suggests that a mixed infection of both serotype a and d strains was present in hc <dig> . this observation is reminiscent of the finding by desnos-ollivier et al.  <cit>  that mixed infections are relatively common . the colonies obtained from patient hc <dig> also indicated a mixed infection because one colony showed copy number elevation for part of chr  <dig> , and another colony showed no copy number variation. interestingly, a copy number change at chr  <dig> was present in all three of the isolates tested from patient hc <dig> . in these isolates, it appeared that the chromosome was duplicated but that one copy had a deleted region near the center of the chromosome. it is possible that duplication of the deleted region is not tolerated. facs analysis indicated that the hc- <dig> isolates were diploid . overall, these results indicated that variation in chromosomal copy number was present in isolates from patients with hiv/aids, and provided additional evidence for mixed infections.

discussion
emerging evidence supports the view that the genome of c. neoformans exhibits plasticity beyond the haploid euploidy commonly observed in most clinical and environmental isolates  <cit> . as demonstrated here, genomic variation such as aneuploidy appears to have a major impact on the virulence of c. neoformans in a mammalian host. however, detailed investigations are needed to link specific changes to pathogenesis and the clinical outcome of cryptococcosis. in our study, we made the key observation that the black  and white  variants of cbs <dig> differed in their virulence in mice. this difference may be attributed to melanin formation because mutants defective in melanin are known to have reduced virulence and impaired dissemination to the brain  <cit> . however, the numbers of yeast cells in lung and brain tissue were similar for the black and white strains. these observations argue against melanin as the sole reason for the difference in virulence. rather, it appears that melanin formation, although particularly sensitive to variation in chromosome copy number in cbs <dig>  may be just one of a number of traits affected by chromosomal changes. that is, aneuploidy in general may impair virulence through a number of mechanisms. for example, in other fungi, such as s. cerevisiae, aneuploidy results in a decreased growth rate and an imbalance in gene expression  <cit> . for c. neoformans, we found that white strains grew more slowly in culture but their proliferation in the host was not impaired. thus our in vitro growth conditions did not reflect proliferation in vivo. our histopathological observations also suggested other contributors to the observed difference in virulence. for example, it appeared that infections with black strains resulted in more airway remodeling and this damage may account for the greater virulence. it is also possible that the enhanced expression of genes on chr  <dig> that we observed in the white strain created an imbalance in gene expression that directly or indirectly influenced the elaboration of known or unknown virulence factors. for example, it is likely that secreted factors contribute to pathology in the lung, and our observation that white, disomic strains have increased sensitivity to brefeldin a suggests an underlying perturbation of the secretory pathway.

the discovery of disomy in strain cbs <dig> raises the question of whether this strain is particularly prone to genome instability, perhaps due to background defects in chromosome replication and segregation. the strain was initially selected for cgh analysis because boekhout and van belkum  <cit>  reported that it had an unusually small genome . however, cgh did not reveal differences in content relative to the reference genome of strain h <dig>  <cit> . in the current study, the ease in detecting additional chromosome changes in our analysis of second-generation variants supports the possibility of general genome instability in cbs <dig>  conversely, chromosome and ploidy changes may be more common than previously appreciated in species of cryptococcus, as indicated by reports of extensive genome variation including karyotype variability and changes in clinical and environmental strains of c. neoformans and c. gattii in culture and in mammalian hosts  <cit> . the study of fries et al.  <cit>  is particularly informative because they found differences in karyotypes  in sequential isolates of c. neoformans from aids patients. in addition, they passaged strains through mice and documented similar changes in karyotypes in cells recovered for three of the six isolates. the karyotype variations likely reflect translocations and segmental changes, and it is possible that stress conditions in mammalian hosts  promote chromosome variation. in our mouse passage experiments, the percentage of black colonies recovered from tissue was higher than in the starting inoculum, suggesting that they arose during infection. although we are cautious about drawing conclusions about the frequency of copy number variation based solely on melanin as a surrogate indicator, our subsequent qpcr and cgh analyses revealed multiple chromosome changes in variants after passage in mice. more detailed studies with tagged chromosomes and fluctuation analysis will be needed to more closely examine the frequency of copy number change in animals and in response to stress.

more recently, sionov et al.  <cit>  analyzed fluconazole heteroresistance in the commonly studied c. neoformans strain h <dig> and found copy number changes for several chromosomes. in this case, selection for high-level resistance was correlated with disomy for chrs  <dig> and  <dig>  a reduced growth rate and lower virulence. they also found a difference in virulence between a fluconazole resistant derivative h <dig> r <dig> and the parental h <dig> strain. specifically, ~20% of the mice infected with the disomic strain died by the end of the experiment compared with ~50% inoculated with the wild-type strain. the appearance of disomic chromosomes in fluconazole-resistant isolates also occurs in the related species c. gattii  <cit> . in our study, we demonstrated that disomy could be detected in strain h <dig> by tagging chr  <dig> with a neomycin resistance marker and selecting on high levels of neomycin. however, some isolates showed the expected amplification of chr  <dig> and others had changes in different chromosomes. together, these studies suggest that copy number variation is a common property of c. neoformans.

genomic variation in c. neoformans extends beyond aneuploidy to include the occurrence of diploid strains arising from a-α and same-sex mating, endoreplication or clonal mating, as well as the formation of polyploid cells in infected animals  <cit> . for example, lengeler et al.  <cit>  examined  <dig> hybrid strains thought to arise from the fusion of serotype a and d mating partners, and they found that six were diploid and four were aneuploid with dna content between 1n and 2n. we subsequently examined three of these ad hybrids by cgh and found that some chromosomes were preferentially retained from one parental genome or the other  <cit> . for example, all three strains retained chr  <dig> from the serotype a parent and lost the serotype d homologue. a survey of an additional  <dig> ad hybrid strains revealed that chr  <dig> from the a serotype genomes was preferentially retained in  <dig> of the isolates  <cit> . recently, lin et al.  <cit>  surveyed  <dig> clinical and environmental strains of a serotype and found that  <dig> % were diploid based on fluorescence flow cytometry. thus diploid strains are relatively common, although in contrast, only six of the isolates appeared to be aneuploid. characterization of laboratory-constructed diploids demonstrated that elevated ploidy has a minor negative influence on virulence in mice, and it is clear that diploids contribute to the disease spectrum because of the occurrence of these strains and mixed infections in aids patients  <cit> . interestingly, desnos-ollivier et al.,  <cit>  showed that mixed infections with strains of different mating type, serotype, genotype and ploidy occur at a high frequency  in patients; many of the isolates  in this study were diploid. multilocus sequence typing indicated that some of the isolates may have arisen through diploidization . in our analysis, one strain from an aids patient  appeared to be diploid with a copy number difference at chr  <dig>  an isolate from a second patient  also contained an elevated copy number for a segment of chr  <dig>  additional complexity comes from the discovery of tetraploid or octoploid cells that arise as a proportion of cryptococcal cells in the lungs of infected mice  <cit> . it is possible that disomy may result from the reduction in chromosome number as cells transition from the diploid or polyploid states to the haploid complement of chromosomes. overall, the emerging view is that aneuploidy and changes in ploidy are common features of c. neoformans.

the occurrence of aneuploidy in c. neoformans is reminiscent of the situation in other fungal pathogens, and especially in the pathogenic yeast candida albicans  <cit> . the diploid genome of this fungus exhibits a high level of plasticity, as strains with chromosomal rearrangements, loss of heterozygosity and aneuploidy are frequently observed. in addition, mating between diploid strains yields tetraploid strains that do not undergo meiosis but instead display random chromosome loss. as in c. neoformans, clinical isolates of c. albicans show considerable genomic diversity with the detection of translocations, chromosomal truncations and the formation of extra chromosomes. elegant studies have shown that whole-chromosome or segmental aneuploidy can readily be detected by cgh and that this variation is associated with a growth advantage on l-sorbose or d-arabinose and with resistance to fluconazole  <cit> . considerable genomic variation also occurs during growth in mammalian hosts and it has been found that aneuploidy influences virulence  <cit> . changes during dna transformation also are observed in c. albicans and our observations on the appearance of disomic strains during neomycin selection indicates that similar variation may occur in c. neoformans  <cit> . chromosome variation is also a feature of the haploid yeast pathogen candida glabrata. specifically, poláková et al.  <cit>  examined the chromosome complements of  <dig> clinical isolates and found considerable variation including frequent examples of translocations, segmental duplications and the appearance of novel chromosomes. the sequences in regions of variation may influence interactions with the host and disease outcomes because they encode proteases, phospholipases and potential antifungal drug transporters. in fact, an isolate carrying a novel minichromosome showed increased tolerance to fluconazole.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome variability documented here and in earlier work  <cit>  could influence the virulence and persistence of c. neoformans, and therefore impact disease outcome. cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is difficult to treat, particularly in aids patients because of the persistence of the fungus . long-term antifungal drug therapy is sometimes necessary to prevent the recurrence of cryptococcosis in these patients  <cit> . changes in ploidy and reversible chromosome copy number during infection likely mediate changes in gene expression and phenotype that could impact latency, chronic infection, antifungal drug susceptibility and the response to host defenses. certainly aneuploidy is beneficial in the response to stress in other fungi, and both aneuploidy and polyploidy may provide mechanisms for cells to generate adaptive variability and deal with environmental challenges  <cit> . in general, it is important to understand the genetic flexibility of the pathogen as an aspect of efforts to control infection, and a number of important questions remain. these include whether propagation in culture versus the host environment preferentially results in chromosome variation and whether selective pressure in the host  influences chromosome instability. it will also be important to determine whether specific chromosomal changes and underlying alterations in the expression of virulence factors contributes to adaptation in different host tissues, to latency, and to resistance to host defense mechanisms. the answers to these questions will reveal the range of phenotypic changes determined by copy number change at each chromosome, and further establish relevance to disease.
