BACKGROUND
apoptosis, a major form of cell death, is a significant biological phenomenon that removes unnecessary, superfluous, damaged or harmful cells in multicellular organisms. apoptosis is important for tissue morphogenesis during development, maintenance of homeostasis in adulthood, and defense and immune responses  <cit> . in apoptosis, activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases induces the proteolytic cleavage of many critical proteins, leading to cell suicide  <cit> . in mammals,  <dig> caspases have been identified. of these, caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> play roles as initiators, while caspases- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> function as downstream effectors. the activation of effector caspases is the converging point of two major signal pathways: the extrinsic pathway initiated by ligation of cell surface receptors called "death receptors", including fas  and receptors for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand , and the intrinsic pathway triggered by cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol.

the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway following fas ligation has been well characterized  <cit> . oligomerization of fas by its natural ligand or an agonistic antibody recruits the adaptor molecule fadd   <cit>  to the death domain  of the fas intracellular region. procaspase- <dig> , which is an inactive zymogen, associates in turn with fadd by interactions between their death effector domains   <cit> . within the fas-fadd-procaspase- <dig> complex, called the death-inducing signaling complex   <cit> , procaspase- <dig> undergoes auto-cleavage to convert to an active form. through cleavage, activated caspase- <dig> activates downstream effector caspases and bid, a member of the bcl- <dig> family, eventually leading to cell death  <cit> . deficiency in caspase- <dig> leads to suppression of fas-mediated apoptosis  <cit> .

although most studies examining the extrinsic apoptosis pathway have utilized mammalian systems, homologs of the apoptosis signaling molecules, including death receptors and caspases, have recently been identified in zebrafish , including two death receptors, the zebrafish hematopoietic death receptor  and the ovarian tnfr   <cit> . caspase- <dig> and two additional caspases that are homologous to human caspases- <dig> and - <dig> have been characterized in zebrafish  <cit> . caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are also identified and characterized in salmon and sea bass  <cit> . several genes with homology to mammalian regulators of apoptosis, including caspase- <dig>  bid and fadd, have been identified in the zebrafish  <cit> . thus, the apoptotic machinery appears to be conserved between fish and mammals. no extensive functional analyses of these apoptotic regulators have been performed in fish.

to understand the general mechanisms regulating cell death in vertebrates, we studied the apoptotic machinery governing the extrinsic signaling pathway in fish. in this study, we identified and characterized orthologs of mammalian fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> that might be indispensable for extrinsic apoptotic signaling in medaka fish . we report that these molecules act as pro-apoptotic molecules and are able to substitute for the functions of their mammalian counterparts in mammalian cells. these results suggest the evolutionary conservation between fish and mammals of the core components essential for the extrinsic pathway. we also discuss the development of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in conjunction with the appearance of vertebrates during evolution.

RESULTS
primary structure of medaka fas, fadd, and casp <dig> molecules
we searched the genbank dna database for the fish homologs of mammalian fas , fadd and caspase- <dig> , three essential components of fas-mediated apoptotic signaling. we identified an expressed sequence tag  clone  similar to fas, an est clone  similar to fadd and two est clones  similar to casp <dig> in the medaka cdna library. sequencing of these est clones confirmed that the full-length cdnas encoded open reading frames of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids, exhibiting homology to fas, fadd and caspase- <dig>  respectively, by a blast search  <cit> . protein structure analysis using the pfam database  <cit>  showed that the predicted fas-like molecule contained a dd in the cytoplasmic region, the fadd-like molecule possessed both ded and dd, while the caspase-8-like molecule contained two deds and a protease domain. therefore, these proteins might be orthologs to mammalian fas, fadd and caspase-8; we termed the molecules encoded by these cdna clones medaka fas, fadd and caspase- <dig>  alignments of the medaka and human fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> molecules revealed 24%, 34% and 34% identity and 42%, 52% and 52% similarity at the amino acid sequence level, respectively . comparison of medaka fas to the zebrafish death receptors, zebrafish hematopoietic death receptor  and ovarian tumor necrosis factor receptor   <cit>  identified 22% and 20% identity at the amino acid level, respectively. these results suggest that medaka fas is more similar to human fas than to fish zh-dr and otr. thus, we identified structurally similar molecules potentially orthologous to mammalian fas, fadd and caspase- <dig>  core components of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, in the medaka fish.

genomic structure of the medaka fas, fadd and casp <dig> genes
to confirm that the isolated medaka fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> are orthologs of their mammalian counterparts, we examined the genomic structure of the fas , fadd and caspase- <dig>  orthologous genes in fish, mammals and birds. by comparing the genomic and the cdna sequences, we determined the organization of the medaka fas, fadd and casp <dig> genes. the medaka fas gene consisted of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, corresponding to those in the human and chicken fas gene with coincident splice junction sites . the nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron boundaries in the medaka fas gene  completely conformed to the gt-ag rule  <cit> . the medaka fadd gene possessed two exons, identical to that of the human gene . additionally, search of the genbank and ensembl genome databases revealed that the fadd genes in the human , mouse , chicken , west african clawed frog  and two species of fish, stickleback  and zebrafish  consisted of two exons . in the medaka fadd gene, the gt-ag rule was also observed at the exon-intron boundaries . by comparing genomic sequences to the obtained medaka casp <dig> cdna sequence, we confirmed that the casp <dig> gene consists of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . the nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron boundaries of the medaka casp <dig> gene agree with the gt-ag rule . the genomic organization of the medaka casp <dig> gene was similar to that of the human and chicken casp <dig> genes with mostly coincident splice junction sites, but additional exons comprising a portion of the first ded and the protease domain were present in the medaka casp <dig> gene . we also determined the genomic structure of the stickleback and zebrafish casp <dig> genes, and detected additional exons in the stickleback casp <dig> gene but not the zebrafish casp <dig> gene . this corresponded to the phylogenetic relationships, indicating that medaka and stickleback are more closely related to each other than either of them is to zebrafish  <cit> . thus, these conserved structures of the fas, fadd and casp <dig> genes within vertebrates strongly suggest that these genes share their origin respectively.

genomic organization of the medaka fas, fadd and casp <dig> genes
to understand the evolutionary divergence or conservation of the core molecular components required for the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, we next examined the genomic location of the fas gene in vertebrates by computational analysis. the human fas gene localizes to chromosome  <dig> , according to locuslink . search of the zebrafish genome sequence in the ensembl database identified a fas-like gene on scaffold <dig> that was highly homologous to the human and medaka fas genes . within the assembly, this scaffold corresponds to chr.  <dig>  and we found a syntenic relationship between this zebrafish genomic region and the human chromosomal segment including the human fas gene. putative orthologs of papss <dig>  pten and ifit <dig>  which co-localize with the fas gene on human chr.  <dig> are found in close proximity to the fas-like gene in the zebrafish genome. this gene organization was also conserved in the chicken chr.  <dig> and at least partially in the medaka and fugu  genomes . in addition, comparative mapping analysis predicted the presence of the fas gene in the frog genome . therefore, the genomic organization around the fas gene locus exhibits synteny throughout vertebrates.

genomic organizations around the fadd gene were also well conserved among the vertebrate genomes . in the human genome, the ccnd <dig>  oraov <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  tmem16a, fadd, ppfia <dig> and cttn genes are encoded in this order on chr.  <dig>  this gene order is also conserved in the chicken genome. in the fish genomes, the gene order from ccnd <dig> to fadd is also conserved  <cit> , although the ppfia <dig> and cttn genes, which are 3' neighbors of the fadd gene, were replaced with npsn and mtch <dig>  the only exception we found was the x. tropicalis genome. in this genome, the chromosomal segment from oraov <dig> to tmem16a is translocated and thus the gene order in this genome is ccnd1-fadd-ppfia1-cttn. this data suggests the overall syntenic conservation of the genomic regions around the fadd gene within the vertebrates and that a chromosomal rearrangement event in a genomic region downstream of the fadd gene has occurred after the divergence of fish and other vertebrates .

we investigated the genomic organization of the casp <dig> gene in fish and other vertebrates, and the chromosomal segment around this gene is conserved between fish and other vertebrates  <cit> . in the medaka genome, a putative ortholog of the mcm <dig> gene, which localizes close to the casp <dig> gene on human chr.  <dig>  resides near the casp <dig> gene . the orientation and position of casp <dig> and mcm <dig> genes were consistent with those identified in the fugu genome database. moreover, upstream of the casp <dig> gene, a casp8-like gene was identified with a region encoding the protease domain possessing the caspase specific active site qacqg . the predicted amino acid sequence of the casp8-like molecule was highly similar to the protease domain of mammalian caspase- <dig> proteins  by blastp searches. phylogenetic studies also suggested that the protease domain of the casp8-like molecule is most similar to that of casp <dig> but not to that of other caspases  <cit> . the putative orthologous genes for this medaka casp8-like gene were also found in the fugu, stickleback and zebrafish genomes, localizing next to the casp <dig> gene . these gene products similar to casp <dig> lack two ded motifs in its n-terminus but contain a caspase recruitment domain , which were revealed by the interproscan program using the interpro database . in the present study, this casp8-like gene was tentatively termed as card-casp <dig>  therefore, we suggest that the card-casp <dig> gene is derived from a copy occurred by a tandem duplication of the ancestral casp <dig> gene in the fish lineage, and that one of the duplicated copies might acquire a card and probably a new function at the same time.

molecular phylogenetic analysis of fas, fadd and casp8
domain organizations, genomic structures and syntenies between the vertebrate genomes strongly suggest that these medaka genes identified in this study are true orthologs for fas, fadd and casp <dig>  molecular phylogenetic analyses for these genes also reinforced the orthologies of these genes. for constructing a molecular phylogenetic tree for fas and fadd proteins, we used fas and fadd sequences manually predicted from the chicken, zebrafish and stickleback genomes together with published catfish , frog, human and mouse fas and fadd sequences  <cit>  . a molecular phylogenetic tree for the fas and fadd families based on an alignment of the death domain indicated that medaka fas and fadd were most similar to fish fas and fadd, respectively . the generated tree suggests that medaka fas is closest to zebrafish fas-like molecule , and supports its orthology for fas proteins encoded in the genome of amphibians and amniotes . additionally, we could not find any typical death receptors bearing a dd in invertebrates from the public databases . this was supported by reports describing no orthologs of the death receptors in spite of extensive screens of decoded genomes, even in the genome of ciona intestinalis, a close relative of vertebrates  <cit> . therefore, these lines of evidence suggest that the death receptor such as fas appears early during vertebrate evolution.

similarly, the molecular phylogenetic tree suggested that fish fadd proteins including medaka fadd are monophyletic , and these proteins are orthologous for fadd proteins encoded in the genome of amphibians and amniotes . however, alignment of the c-terminal amino acid sequences of these fadd molecules revealed diversity among mammals and other vertebrates including fish . in the c-terminal portion of the molecule neighboring the dd, human and mouse fadd are phosphorylated at ser residues  for the regulation of mitosis  <cit> . this c-terminal extension is not present in birds, frogs, or fish. a gene encoding a putative fadd is also found in an ascidia, molgula tectiformis. although the molgula fadd molecule certainly possesses both ded and dd motifs, it is highly divergent from that of vertebrates . moreover, a gene for fadd was identified in drosophila, but the structure of drosophila fadd is distinct from those of chordate fadd molecules because of lacking a definite ded  <cit> . therefore, the origin of fadd, which might be present in a common ancestor of chordates, is older than that of fas, which may have arisen in the vertebrate lineage. similarly, medaka casp <dig> is suggested to be a member of the caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> family, . thus, the genes encoding core components of the extrinsic signaling pathway, fas, fadd and casp <dig>  are present in the fish genome but are not completely in the non-vertebrate chordate and other invertebrate genomes.

pro-apoptotic activity of medaka fas, fadd and casp8
as the predicted amino acid sequences of medaka fas, fadd and casp <dig> exhibit homology to their mammalian counterparts, these proteins likely play an equally critical role in the regulation of apoptosis. to confirm the universal function of fas, fadd and casp <dig> in vertebrates, we investigated the killing activity of these medaka molecules following exogenous expression in mammalian cells. we generated several expression constructs coexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein   and transiently introduced them into mammalian cell lines. the cell viability of transfectants expressing medaka molecules was examined by monitoring egfp expression by microscopy. the pme18s-h/ofas and pme18s-hfas plasmids, carrying the chimeric h/ofas gene and human fas cdna, respectively, or the control pme18s empty vector were cotransfected with a construct carrying the egfp gene into mouse nih3t <dig> cells. after  <dig> h, transfected cells were stimulated with the agonistic anti-human fas antibody ch <dig>  a potent apoptotic stimulant specific for human fas-expressing cells  <cit> , for  <dig> h. the viability of transfectants bearing the control empty vector was unaffected by the presence of ch <dig>  which does not recognize mouse fas on nih3t <dig> cells . in contrast, treatment with ch <dig> induced cell death in transfectants expressing chimeric h/ofas molecules. both a reduction in the numbers of egfp-positive cells and an increase in the numbers of apoptotic bodies were observed , comparable to those changes seen in human fas-expressing transfectants . to confirm that the cell death induced by chimeric h/ofas is apoptotic cell death, we examined caspase- <dig>  activation, which occurs during apoptosis, in transfectants. the pme18s-h/ofas or pme18s-hfas plasmid was cotransfected with a construct carrying the lbr-egfp fusion gene into nih3t <dig> cells. after  <dig> h, transfected cells were stimulated with or without ch <dig> for  <dig> h. activation of casp <dig> in cells expressing egfp in the nucleus was analyzed by immunocytochemical staining with an anti-cleaved casp <dig> antibody. following proteolytic processing of the inactive zymogen, casp <dig> forms subunits and becomes active. following treatment with ch <dig>  we detected activated casp <dig> in egfp-positive cells coexpressing either h/ofas or hfas . however, no casp <dig> activation was observed in egfp-negative or untreated cells . these data indicate that chimeric h/ofas is a functional molecule with killing activity; the putative death domain in medaka fas cytoplasmic tail is capable of transmitting apoptotic signals to mammalian cells in response to exogenous stimuli.

to test the pro-apoptotic activity of medaka fadd, we transfected pme18s-flag/ofadd-egfp into two mammalian cell lines, human hela cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts  cells, in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, carbobenzoyl-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone  . as hela cells preserve the fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway, they are suitable for examining the potency of pro-apoptotic molecules such as fadd and caspase- <dig>  exogenous expression of medaka fadd induced cell death in hela transfectants, resulting in reductions in the numbers of egfp-positive cells associated with increased apoptotic bodies . the addition of zvad-fmk, however, inhibited the killing activity of medaka fadd, permitting the survival of the majority of egfp-positive cells . using mef cells isolated from both wild-type and casp8-deficient embryos  <cit> , we examined the pro-apoptotic activity of medaka fadd. we assumed that casp8-deficient mef cells, but not wild-type mef cells, are unable to transmit apoptotic signals triggered by medaka fadd. indeed, ectopically expressed medaka fadd induced cell death in wild-type mefs, as evidenced by the reduced numbers of egfp-positive cells and the appearance of apoptotic bodies . in contrast, medaka fadd failed to induce cell death in casp8-deficient mef cells, as the majority of egfp-positive cells survived and retained normal morphology . to confirm the pro-apoptotic activity of medaka fadd, we examined the dna content of cells expressing medaka fadd by flow cytometry . overexpression of medaka fadd in hela cells increased the cellular population in a sub-g <dig> fraction , one indicator of apoptosis  <cit> . in contrast, coexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule p <dig>  a known pan-caspase inhibitor  <cit> , with medaka fadd reduced this population of cells . these data indicate that medaka fadd is able to transmit apoptotic signals into transfected cells via activation of mammalian caspase- <dig> 

to assess the pro-apoptotic activity of medaka caspase- <dig>  the egfp/ocasp <dig> fusion protein was expressed in hela cells in the absence or presence of either zvad-fmk or cytokine response modifier a  . exogenous expression of medaka casp <dig> induced cell death in transfected cells. however, casp8-induced killing was inhibited by both zvad-fmk and crma. following transfection, the number of egfp-positive cells was reduced , while the number of egfp-positive cells increased after culture in zvad-fmk or following crma coexpression . as crma acts as a specific inhibitor by blocking the protease activity of mammalian caspase- <dig>  <cit> , our data indicate that protease activity is absolutely required for medaka caspase-8-mediated cell death. aggregates of death-effector filaments, identified in a previous report  <cit> , were observed in the surviving cells that expressed egfp/ocasp <dig> in the presence of either zvad-fmk or crma . as shown in figure 5f, expression of medaka caspase- <dig> led to an increase in the sub-g <dig> fraction in transfected hela cells, but this was abrogated by the co-expression of p <dig> . these data suggest that medaka caspase- <dig> is a pro-apoptotic molecule requiring homotypic oligomerization, a characteristic shared by mammalian ded-containing molecules.

discussion
in this study, we identified and characterized the disc components fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> from medaka fish. our determination of the genomic structure of the fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> genes revealed that the genomic organization of these genes is preserved between fish and mammals. these gene products also exhibited similar protein structures and functions to their mammalian counterparts. in cytotoxic assays, medaka fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> exhibited pro-apoptotic activity even in mammalian cells. thus, these results clearly showed that the apoptotic machinery downstream of cell surface death receptors is functional in fish as well as mammals.

six death receptors have been identified in mammals  <cit> , and it was assumed that at least one fish ortholog of mammalian death receptors could be found. indeed, two death receptors, zh-dr and otr have been previously identified in zebrafish  <cit> . a recent report proposed that they are counterparts of mammalian trail receptors, but not fas  <cit> . in this study, we identified a molecule exhibiting the closest homology to mammalian fas. we concluded that this molecule is a bone fide fish ortholog for mammalian fas by several lines of evidence: its domain structure , similarity of its genomic structure , the conservation of synteny of the fas gene-containing genomic region between humans and medaka , a molecular phylogenetical evidence  and the functionality of the medaka fas death domain for the transmission of apoptotic signals . thus, fish possess several death receptors including fas that show similar protein structures and potencies to mammalian receptors. in contrast to the fish, no death receptors containing a dd motif have yet been identified in the insect, ascidian and sea urchin genomes  <cit> . therefore, we argue that death receptors, such as fas, appear to be unique to vertebrates . additionally, further analysis in the genome of jawless vertebrates such as lamprey will be helpful for confirming our inference.

members of the fadd protein family have been identified and characterized in mammals, amphibians and insects. although drosophila fadd   <cit>  physically interacts with and activates dredd, a drosophila counterpart of caspase- <dig>  it does not interact with mammalian death receptors or caspase- <dig> in mammalian cells  <cit> . there are no orthologs of the death receptor in drosophila  <cit> . it was recently reported that dfadd acts in concert with dredd in immune defenses against bacterial infections  <cit> , indicating a functional difference in fadd molecules between these species. we determined that medaka fadd is able to induce apoptosis of mammalian cells. in addition, mammalian caspase- <dig> is required for the pro-apoptotic activity of medaka fadd , which demonstrates that fadd function is conserved between fish and mammals. we previously demonstrated that xenopus fadd could substitute functionally for mammalian fadd  <cit> . there is an evolutional divergence in the function of these proteins between vertebrates and insects. we identified fadd-like genes in the ascidian molgula tectiformis, sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus and cnidaria hydra magnipapillata in the genbank database . the predicted amino acid sequences of these gene products reveal conservation of the ded and dd, but not the c-terminal extension present in mammals. this might be a universal function of fadd that has been conserved from simple metazoans to vertebrates during evolution. we hypothesize that the adaptor molecule fadd has two functions; one is required for the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in vertebrates, while the second has not yet been defined, but is broadly conserved in bilaterian.

in humans, the casp <dig>  caspase- <dig>  and cflar  genes, which localize in a cluster at the same chromosomal region  <cit> , are thought to be arisen by duplication of an ancestral gene because of their common unique protein structure consisting of two deds and a protease domain and high similarity in amino acid sequences. in both birds and amphibians, these casp <dig>  casp <dig> and cflar genes, which map to the same chromosome, have been identified  <cit> . we have searched for casp <dig> and cflar genes in fish, identifying casp10-like and cflar genes in the genomic database of zebrafish, tetraodon and fugu. in these fish, the casp <dig> and cflar genes are uniquely segregated to distinct chromosomes  <cit> . in medaka, the casp10-like and cflar-like genes were also found in the genome database, but they localized in the contigs distinct from the casp <dig> gene , suggesting the chromosomal segregation of these three genes in medaka. interestingly, we identified a gene, which encodes a protease domain highly similar to that of casp <dig>  next to the casp <dig> gene in the medaka chromosome . based on the full-length sequence data for the casp8-like gene, we concluded that this gene represents a distinct caspase type containing the card motif from caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  and termed as card-casp <dig>  moreover, this gene product exhibited pro-apoptotic activity similar to casp <dig> . although the present study does not fully address the function of card-casp <dig>  our data suggest that the casp <dig> and card-casp <dig> genes diverged from an ancestral gene by local duplication . the mechanisms by which caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> act independently or compensate for each other in these organisms and by which cflar regulates the activation of these caspases are important to understand the biological significance of these molecules in vertebrates. further functional analyses of caspase- <dig> and its related molecules including card-casp <dig> in fish will help resolve the relationship of caspase function to the divergence observed throughout evolution.

in the catfish, fas-, fadd- and casp8-like genes have been identified  <cit> . as the amino acid sequences predicted from the catfish fas-like and fadd-like genes exhibited 37% and 43% identities to the medaka counterparts, these genes are probably also orthologs of mammalian fas and fadd. the functions of these catfish molecules, however, have not yet been defined. the catfish casp8-like gene is not likely to be an ortholog of mammalian caspase- <dig> because this gene product has no ded but possesses a card . regardless, our study strongly suggests the evolutionary conservation of the pro-apoptotic ability of fas, fadd and caspase- <dig>  the core components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, in medaka fish. our data is further supported by a recent report indicating that zebrafish components required for extrinsic pathway induce cell death in embryos when overexpressed  <cit> .

in addition to the fas, fadd and caspase- <dig> genes, the caspase- <dig> and bid genes, whose products play roles as effector and amplifier, respectively, downstream of caspase- <dig>  were identified in the database . the medaka fas ligand-like gene was also detected in the ensembl genome database , and its predicted amino acid sequence was highly similar to fas ligand previously identified in zebrafish and flounder  <cit> . thus, the molecular machinery required for the extrinsic pathway fully exists in medaka fish, and medaka is a representative model vertebrate suitable for studies of gene function and development  <cit> . medaka will serve as a powerful tool in which to dissect both the basic mechanisms and the complexities of apoptosis induction throughout evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
our study clearly demonstrated that medaka fas, fadd and casapse- <dig> are functional molecules possessing pro-apoptotic capacity. as shown in figure  <dig>  medaka and probably other fishes have completed these core components essential for the extrinsic pathway while chordates and other invertebrates lack one or more components in their genomes. therefore, it reaches the conclusion that the apoptotic signaling machinery is evolutionarily conserved throughout vertebrates and this novel apoptotic system has been established after the divergence between vertebrates and non-vertebrates.
