BACKGROUND
dna topoisomerases maintain the proper topological state of dna required for vital cellular functions to proceed. the change in dna topology is catalyzed via concerted breaking and rejoining of dna coupled with dna strand passage  <cit> , forming a covalent topoisomerase complex with cleaved dna as the catalytic intermediate. the accumulation of the covalent complex accounts for the lethal effects of many topoisomerase inhibitors that are utilized as anticancer or antibacterial drugs in therapeutic applications  <cit> . these drugs target type ib and type iia topoisomerases, classified according to their structural and mechanistic properties. discovery of similar topoisomerase poison inhibitors for type ia topoisomerases, which include bacterial topoisomerase i enzyme, could lead to the discovery of novel antibacterial agents that can be used for treatment of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens. it has been demonstrated via mutants defective in dna rejoining that accumulation of e. coli or yersinia pestis topoisomerase i cleavage complex in e. coli leads to rapid bacterial cell death  <cit>  validating bacterial topoisomerase i as a new therapeutic target  <cit> . in addition to poison inhibitors, catalytic inhibitors that act by a different mechanism could also be useful therapeutic agents for bacterial pathogens that require a functional topoisomerase i enzyme for viability or pathogenicity. it has been suggested that at least one type ia topoisomerase enzyme activity must be present in each organism for resolving topological barriers that require single-stranded dna cleavage  <cit> . unlike e. coli, which encodes topoisomerase iii as a second type ia topoisomerase, m. tuberculosis has only one type ia topoisomerase activity. results from previous transposon mutagenesis studies strongly suggest that the topoisomerase i function is required for m. tuberculosis growth and survival during infection  <cit> . m. tuberculosis topoisomerase i  has been proposed as a target for discovery of new tb drugs  <cit>  that are urgently needed due to the large number of human deaths caused by tb globally, and the increasing incidence of tb strains resistant to all available current drugs.

to study the structure-function of mttop <dig> and to monitor its activity, it would be desirable to have a rapid genetic assay for its specific function. the e. coli strain as <dig>  <cit>  has a mutation in the chromosomal topa gene that reduces the topoisomerase i relaxation activity, with growth permissible at 30°c but non-permissive at 42°c unless complemented by recombinant relaxation activity  <cit> . the topoisomerase i enzyme of e. coli and m. tuberculosis shares a highly homologous transesterification domain  that is conserved among all type ia topoisomerases. it contains the active site tyrosine residue for nucleophilic attack of dna in the formation of the covalent cleavage complex, and residues in the toprim domain required for coordination of mg2+ during catalysis  <cit> . dna cleavage site selectivity was found to involve the preference of a cytosine at the- <dig> position relative to the cleavage sites preferred by topoisomerase i and reverse gyrase enzymes in the type ia family of topoisomerases  <cit> . however, the transesterification domain cannot carry out relaxation of negative supercoils in the absence of the c-terminal domain  <cit> . the c-terminal domains of e. coli and m. tuberculosis topoisomerase i belong to two distinct families. the c-terminal domain of e. coli topoisomerase i has multiple tetracysteine motifs for coordination of zn ions required for relaxation activity  <cit> , while the c-terminal domains of topoisomerase i found in mycobacterium smegmatis and m. tuberculosis were found not to have any zn coordinating tetracysteine motifs  <cit> .

in addition to the difference between the c-terminal domain sequences of mycobacterium and e. coli topoisomerase i, it is also unclear if mttop <dig> can be functional in e. coli due to the significant difference in codon usage between e. coli and m. tuberculosis. the structure-function study of mttop <dig> would be greatly facilitated if a rapid genetic assay system utilizing e. coli can be established. for further study of the enzymatic properties of mttop <dig>  we have initiated biochemical studies of mttop <dig> to take advantage of the absence of cysteine residue in its sequence. if a unique cysteine can be introduced into a specific position via site-directed mutagenesis without diminishing the catalytic activity, spectroscopic or chemical probes can then be introduced to study the protein-dna interactions involved in catalysis. spectrophotometric analysis utilizing these probes could potentially be developed into hts assay for identification and characterization of small molecule inhibitors of mttop <dig> 

in this study, we demonstrated that plasmid encoding mttop <dig> can complement e. coli as <dig> with temperature sensitive topa  <cit>  for growth at 42°c. in addition to demonstrating that the relaxation activity of wild-type mttop <dig> was functional in e. coli, we also showed that when a mutant version of mttop <dig>  with the g <dig> s toprim mutation that inhibits dna religation  <cit>  was overexpressed in e. coli, the sos response is induced along with a significant decrease in viability. therefore, the accumulation of cleavage complex formed by mttop <dig> can also be assayed in e. coli. we utilized the e. coli genetic system to identify a number of positions in mttop <dig> that could be mutated to cysteine with little or no loss of relaxation activity. the retention of relaxation activity was confirmed after the expression and purification of the mutant enzymes. one such cysteine substitution mutant enzyme mttop1-k524c was conjugated to a fluorescence dye for fluorescence resonance energy transfer  study with fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide substrates.

RESULTS
complementation of topa function in e. coli as <dig> for growth at 42°c by m. tuberculosis topoisomerase i
e. coli as <dig> transformed with plasmid pmtop was streaked onto lb plates with ampicillin and incubated at either 30°c or 42°c. plasmid petop expressing recombinant e. coli topoisomerase i in the same vector was used as positive control. complementation for growth at 42°c could be observed with both pmtop and petop. no complementation for growth at 42°c could be seen with the vector pbad/thio . this result showed that the recombinant mttop <dig> interacts with the chromosomal dna in e. coli, and the background uninduced expression of mttop <dig> from the bad promoter in pmtop clone was sufficient for complementation of the temperature sensitive topa function in e. coli as <dig> for growth at 42°c. even though e. coli and m. tuberculosis topoisomerase i enzymes have different c-terminal domain sequences, the conservation of the n-terminal transesterification domain in mttop <dig> is likely to allow mttop <dig> to bind to single-stranded dna associated with negatively supercoiled region of the e. coli chromosome to remove excess negative supercoils.

cell killing from accumulation of mutant mttop <dig> covalent complex in e. coli
the toprim motif dxdxxg is strictly conserved in type ia topoisomerase sequences and plays an essential role for divalent ion coordination and cleavage-religation of dna during catalysis  <cit> . for recombinant e. coli or y. pestis topoisomerase i, mutation of the first aspartate residue in the toprim motif to asparagine has been shown to be extremely lethal to e. coli  <cit> . substitution of the conserved glycine in the toprim motif with serine in e. coli or y. pestis topoisomerase i resulted in mutant topoisomerase i enzyme capable of dna cleavage but defective in dna religation  <cit> . induction of the bad promoter regulating the expression of these gly to ser mutant e. coli and y. pestis topoisomerases resulted in loss of viability of the host e. coli cells  <cit> .

an attempt was made to introduce the asn substitution at the first asp of the toprim motif found in mttop <dig>  by site-directed mutagenesis. clones of pmtop with the desired d111n mutation as a single substitution could not be isolated after transformation of commonly used e. coli cloning strains even in the presence of 2% glucose to suppress transcription from the bad promoter regardless of the reca genotype of the e. coli host cells. this was likely due to the toxic effect of the mutant mttop <dig> background expression on e. coli viability. all the isolated clones had second site mutations, similar to what was observed during attempted construction of e. coli and y. pestis topoisomerase i mutants with the d111n mutation  <cit> . this suggested that e. coli host cells can be very vulnerable to accumulation of covalent cleavage complex formed by recombinant mttop <dig> enzyme in vivo.

the g <dig> s mutation in e. coli topoisomerase i has a lesser lethal effect when compared to the d111n mutation because it accumulates lower amounts of cleavage complex  <cit> . the ser substitution was successfully made at gly <dig> of the mttop <dig> toprim motif in pmtop and a clone with no second-site mutation was isolated in the presence of 2% glucose. the mutant mttop1-g <dig> s enzyme was expressed by arabinose induction and purified. mg2+ ions are required for dna religation and relaxation activity of all type ia topoisomerases  <cit> . mg2+ ions did not have to be added for dna cleavage to be observed by wild-type mttop <dig> , but the dna cleavage activity of mttop1-g <dig> s is mg2+ dependent, similar to the gly to ser substitution mutants previously characterized for e. coli and y. pestis topoisomerase i  <cit> . quantitation of the nicked dna formed  showed that ~30% of the input dna could be converted to the nicked form by mttop1-g <dig> s in the presence of mgcl <dig>  no relaxation activity could be detected for mttop1-g <dig> s as expected from the loss of dna religation activity even in the presence of high concentrations of mg2+ ions .

plasmid pmtop-g116s was transformed into e. coli strain jd <dig> and the transformants were first isolated in the presence of 2% glucose. the transformants were then replica plated onto xgal indicator plate with  <dig> % arabinose to increase the level of synthesis of mutant mttop1-g <dig> s. sos response to the accumulated cleavage complex was evident from the blue color of the colonies in the presence of  <dig> % arabinose resulting from induction of the lacz gene under the control of the dind <dig> promoter in e. coli jd <dig>  <cit> . treatment of an exponential phase culture of jd5/pmtop-g <dig> s with  <dig> % arabinose for  <dig> h resulted in a viable colony count ratio of ~10- <dig> when the number of viable colonies from induced culture were divided by the viable colony counts from the non-induced culture . induction of wild-type mttop <dig> by  <dig> % arabinose reduced the viable counts of e. coli jd <dig> by only ~ <dig> fold. the degree of loss of viability from the gly to ser mutation in pmtop was similar to that observed previously for the same mutation in petop  <cit> . these results showed that the accumulation of the covalent cleavage complex formed by recombinant mttop <dig> in e. coli could result in sos induction and bacterial cell death.

assay of relaxation activity of cysteine-substitution mutants of mttop <dig> by complementation of e. coli topa function
mttop <dig> protein from m. tuberculosis h37rv has the very useful property of having no cysteine residues in its sequence. it is thus an ideal model system for biochemical studies where a unique cysteine can be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to facilitate chemical conjugation of fluorescence or affinity probe at a specific position. expression and purification procedures utilizing plasmid plic-mtop have been developed to produce milligram quantities of soluble and active mttop <dig> protein  <cit> . even though the plic-mtop plasmid requires induction of the t <dig> promoter for high level protein expression, there is likely to be a certain level of constitutive background expression in the absence of t <dig> rna polymerase induction, similar to background expression of mttop <dig> from pmtop in the absence of arabinose induction of the bad promoter. this background expression in plic-mtop was found to be sufficient for complementation of the topa function of e. coli as <dig> for growth when plates incubated at 30°c and 42°c were compared . transformation of e. coli as <dig> with the corresponding vector or plasmid expressing the active site mutant mttop1-y342a did not result in complementation. a number of residues in mttop <dig> were selected for cysteine substitution based on the criteria that the residues are not highly conserved in identity, but are positioned near strictly conserved residues  <cit> . these are shown on the model structure of mttop <dig> in modbase  <cit>  derived from the crystal structure of the n-terminal domain of e. coli topoisomerase i 1mw <dig> . plic-mtop derivatives with these single cysteine substitution were transformed into e. coli as <dig>  complementation of the temperature sensitive topa function in e. coli as <dig> was assayed by growth of the transformants at 42°c, as shown for mttop1-k524c mutant , or more quantitatively by plating serial dilutions of the as <dig> transformant culture and comparing the number of viable colonies obtained after incubation at either 30°c or 42°c . there was no complementation from the y342a or g <dig> s mttop <dig> mutants as expected. the results from the cysteine substitutions mutants suggested that cysteine substitution at most of the positions tested could be tolerated without significantly affecting the ability of mttop <dig> to complement the topa chromosomal mutation in as <dig> for growth at the non-permissive temperature.

serial dilutions of overnight cultures of e. coli as <dig> transformants were plated on lb plates with kanamycin and incubated for  <dig> days at either 30°c or 42°c. colony counts from 42°c incubation were divided by colony counts from 30°c to obtain the complementation ratios. the results represent the average and standard deviation from at least three measurements.

to confirm the retention of relaxation activity after the cysteine substitution, mutant mttop <dig> enzymes with cysteine substitutions at h <dig>  y <dig>  and k <dig> residues located in different regions of the enzyme were expressed and purified for further characterization. in vitro assay of the relaxation activity  confirmed that these enzymes with a single cysteine introduced by mutagenesis had close to wild-type relaxation activity.

cpm-mttop1-k524c relaxation activity and fret experiments
mttop1-k524c was labeled with cpm as described in materials and methods. after labeling, the activity of the labeled enzyme was checked by relaxation activity assay. as shown in figure  <dig>  labeling with cpm did not affect the activity of the k524c mutant enzyme. the labeled mttop1-k524c demonstrated relaxation activity comparable to unlabeled mttop1-k524c. for the fret experiments, a 35-base oligonucleotide substrate was designed to have a stem-loop structure providing the enzyme with both a single-stranded and a double-stranded region for potential interaction. this oligo was labeled with fluorescein at  <dig> positions: 3' end, 5' end and an internal location within the single-stranded loop. upon titration of cpm-mttop1-k524c with substrate labeled with fluorescein at either the 5' or 3' end, no fret was observed . however, upon titration with substrate labeled with fluorescein in the single-stranded loop, a large drop in the cpm emission  and a corresponding increase in the fluorescein emission  indicated the occurrence of fret . the results obtained from the fret experiments were used to calculate the energy transfer efficiency . the maximum transfer efficiency was observed upon titration with the internally labeled oligo . titration with the 3' and the 5' labeled oligo demonstrated transfer efficiencies of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

we found that mttop1-h139c protein could also be labeled with fluorophores with no significant loss of relaxation activity . however, fret was not observed in similar studies of labeled mttop1-h139c with oligonucleotide substrates.

discussion
due to the requirement of topoisomerase i function for m. tuberculosis growth and survival during infection as indicated by transposon mutagenesis studies  <cit> , discovery of specific inhibitors of mttop <dig> could lead to development of novel therapeutics urgently needed for treatment of multi-drug resistant tb. the utilization of mttop <dig> as a potential new drug target would be facilitated by development of simple assays for the catalytic function of the enzyme. it is also desirable to identify poison inhibitors that can result in accumulation of the covalent complex of mttop <dig>  since such topoisomerase poison inhibitors are expected to be bactericidal, and might be useful when used in combination therapy with current tb drugs such as fluoroquinolones  <cit> .

the results described here demonstrated that inhibition of dna religation by recombinant mttop <dig> would result in killing of the e. coli host cells. increased expression of recombinant mttop <dig> should result in hypersensitivity to its poison inhibitors. the catalytic function of recombinant mttop <dig> could also be assessed easily from its complementation of the temperature sensitive topa function in e. coli as <dig> at the non-permissive temperature. despite a potential problem from difference in codon preference of the different organisms, and divergence of the topoisomerase i c-terminal domain sequences, recombinant mttop <dig> could still form covalent cleavage complex on the e. coli chromosome and remove excess negative supercoils so that viable functions can proceed.

the e. coli cell based assays are useful in structure-function studies of the enzyme. mutations that abolish the catalytic activity after amino acid substitutions, such as y342a and g <dig> s, could be identified readily. in another approach to study the enzyme mechanism, cysteine mutagenesis sites in different regions of the enzyme which do not affect the enzyme activity could also be determined rapidly by using the e. coli as <dig> complementation assay. these cysteine substitutions are designed to take advantage of the absence of cysteine in wild-type mttop <dig> sequence to introduce a sulfhydryl group that would allow conjugation of a molecular probe at a unique position on the enzyme. cysteine mutants that could complement as <dig> for growth at non-permissive temperature were found to have close to wild-type relaxation activity when purified, confirming the effectiveness of the genetic assay.

for cpm fluorophore introduced at residue k <dig>  fret was observed with fluorescein fluorophore placed in the single stranded region of the substrate, but not at the double stranded region. in the mechanistic model proposed for the relaxation of dna by topoisomerase i  <cit> , a single strand of dna passes into the interior cavity of the enzyme in order to change the linking number of the dna substrate. that would place the loop region of the single-stranded dna in the vicinity of k <dig>  accounting for fret between cpm-mttop1-k524c and fluorescein in the single-stranded loop region of the substrate. the double-stranded region of the dna substrate may extend from the dna binding groove formed by subdomains i and iv  <cit> , further away from the interior cavity of the enzyme and k <dig>  explaining the absence of fret when fluorescein was placed at the 5' or 3' end of the dna substrate. although h <dig> is closer to the active site tyrosine y <dig> than k <dig>  binding of the stem region of the dna substrate in subdomain iv would place the dna in opposite direction from the active site away from h <dig>  too far for fret to take place. we tried to attach fluorescent probes with the y174c mutant, but the labeling efficiency was poor. other cysteine substitution mutants will be explored in future related mechanistic studies. cysteine substitution mutants of mttop <dig> could potentially be utilized for development of enzyme based hts assays for inhibitors of mttop <dig> activity.

the e. coli cell based assays could also be useful for testing potential mttop <dig> inhibitors. whole cell screenings has identified a large number of small molecules that can inhibit the growth of m. tuberculosis  <cit> , but it is often difficult to quickly determine the cellular target of antibacterial compounds without extensive follow up investigations. previous studies showed that the topa function in e. coli as <dig> can also be complemented by the type ib topoisomerase gene from saccharomyces cerevisae  <cit> . since the type ia and type ib topoisomerases have distinctly different structures and mechanisms, an inhibitor with high specificity against type ia topoisomerase would affect growth of e. coli as <dig> complemented by mttop <dig> activity at the non-permissive temperature, but should have much lower antibacterial activity against e. coli as <dig> complemented by yeast topoisomerase i. this complementation assay system should facilitate the identification of lead compounds that have antibacterial activity due to interactions with m. tuberculosis topoisomerase i in their mechanism of action. toxic compounds that reduce cell viability by interaction with cell membranes or dna can be eliminated quickly in the pursuit of useful drug leads. to facilitate the screening, permeability of e. coli as <dig> to small molecules can be enhanced by incorporation of mutations that affect the drug transporters  <cit>  or membrane structure  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rapid genetic assays in e. coli have been described here for assessing the relaxation activity and accumulation of covalent cleavage complex of recombinant mttop <dig>  the genetic assay was used to identify positions in mttop <dig> that can be converted to cysteine residues without loss of function. one such cysteine was utilized as fret-dye labeling sites to monitor interaction with dna substrate.
