BACKGROUND
yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, is maintained in nature by flea-rodent enzootic cycles and incidentally transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected flea. like y. pestis, the closely related yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the more distantly related yersinia enterocolitica harbor a virulence plasmid that encodes a type iii secretion system  and effector proteins . however, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica are not transmitted by fleas and cause enteric disease in humans  <cit> . several y. pestis genes have been found to be required to infect and be transmitted by fleas. these include the murine toxin gene , the hemin storage  genes, the diguanylate cyclases encoded by y <dig> and hmst, and gmha. the y <dig>  hms, and gmha genes are needed for bis--cyclic dimeric gmp  metabolism, formation of an extracellular polysaccharide and a lipopolysaccharide core modification, respectively, that are necessary for biofilm formation and blockage of the flea proventriculus  <cit> . the murine toxin  gene, which encodes a phospholipase d, is required for survival of y. pestis within the flea midgut  <cit> . however, additional genes may also be important for survival and replication of y. pestis within the flea or play a role in transmission to and survival within the mammalian host.

recent microarray data indicate that a number of genes are differentially regulated by y. pestis during infection of the flea compared to in vitro culture at the same temperature  <cit> . among these were a group of upregulated genes that share homology with insect toxin genes of the toxin complex  family. first identified in photorhabdus luminescens, which maintains a symbiotic relationship with entomopathogenic nematodes of the family heterorhabditidae  <cit> , tc protein homologues are also found in a number of other bacteria including y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis <cit> . in p. luminescens, tc genes are found at four loci which have a high degree of similarity and can be grouped into three basic genetic elements   <cit> . the p. luminescens toxins are upregulated in the insect host  <cit> , interact with each other to form large active toxin complexes and are highly insecticidal  <cit> . furthermore, they have been shown to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of nih 3t <dig> swiss mouse fibroblast cells  <cit> . more recently, p. luminescens toxin complexes were found to adp-ribosylate actin and rho gtpases, respectively, which caused actin polymerization and clustering in human hela cells and resulted in altered phagocytosis by galleria mellonella hemocytes  <cit> .

tc protein homologues are found in all sequenced y. pestis strains available to date . y. pestis tc proteins are termed yita , yitb , yitc , and yipa and yipb  and are found within a single locus in the chromosome   <cit> . although their sequences are highly conserved, y. pestis strains co <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  and z <dig> have an apparent frameshift mutation in yitb , and strain antiqua has an eleven nucleotide deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation in yita. additionally, y. pestis angola has a frameshift mutation in the c-terminus of yipa . previous studies have indicated that the tc genes undergo thermoregulation, with greater expression after growth at 21°c or 26°c than 37°c  <cit> . reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction data indicate that yita, -b, -c genes form an operon and yipa, -b genes are on a different transcriptional unit  <cit> . deletion of the upstream lysr-like regulator  decreased the production of tc proteins  <cit> , indicating that yitr, which is also upregulated following growth of y. pestis in the flea  <cit> , is a positive regulator of expression. similarly to p. luminescens, y. pestis tc proteins form a large multicomponent protein complex that contains all  <dig> tc proteins  <cit> . complex formation requires yita and yitb, and yitc is necessary for association of yipa and yipb with the complex  <cit> .

although there is no defined biological role for the yersinia tc proteins, functional studies indicate that they are important in the interaction with insect cells or specific mammalian host cells. y. pestis tc proteins are not toxic to m. sexta <cit> , whereas y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica  tc proteins are toxic, although they are much less potent than p. luminescens toxins  <cit> . whereas p. luminescens toxins are also toxic to xenopsylla cheopis rat fleas, y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis tc proteins are not  <cit> . additionally, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. pestis tc proteins are not active against spodoptera frugiperda  insect cells  <cit> . however, unlike y. pseudotuberculosis, y. pestis tc proteins are active against nih 3t <dig> mouse fibroblast cells but not caco- <dig> human intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , indicating specificity for certain host environments. there is evidence for t3ss-dependent translocation of y. pestis tc proteins into host cells  <cit>  and tc genes  are upregulated within j774a. <dig> macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, repression of tc gene production  increased phagocytosis by macrophages of y. pestis isolated from fleas  <cit> . however, actual levels of the y. pestis tc proteins in the flea or during growth in liquid culture, or a potential role in survival within or transmission from the flea have not yet been determined.

in this study, we show that the tc proteins yita and yipa are highly produced by y. pestis in the flea but not during growth in culture at the same temperature  and that over-production of yitr increases yita and yipa synthesis in vitro. yita and yipa production was greatest during growth at lower temperatures  and minimally produced at 37°c, although the proteins persisted for more than  <dig> hours after a transition from 22°c to 37°c. yipa appears to be processed near the c-terminus between the rhsa and ptp domains. furthermore, yita and yipa are localized to the outer membrane, and yita is surface-exposed. we also show that the y. pestis tc proteins do not play a detectable role in x. cheopis infection or the ability to produce a transmissible infection.

RESULTS
yita and yipa are synthesized in the flea but not in vitro unless the yitr regulator is over-produced
a diagram of the y. pestis tc locus is shown in figure 1a. x. cheopis fleas were infected with kim6+ or kim6+Δyita-yipb  to compare yita and yipa  protein levels following growth in the flea to growth in bhi culture. yita and yipa were both highly produced by y. pestis in the flea  compared to stationary phase bhi cultures  incubated at 22°c, the same temperature at which the fleas were maintained. yita was detected as a prominent band around  <dig> kda, which corresponded to the expected size based on the yita amino acid sequence. yipa was detected as two major bands. the smaller band at ~ <dig> kda was the most prominent. the larger band at ~ <dig> kda corresponds to the full length yipa predicted by its amino acid sequence and with recombinant yipa synthesized in and purified from e. coli .

to determine if over-production of yitr would result in increased levels of yita and yipa proteins during growth in vitro, the regulator yitr was cloned with its native promoter into the low-copy plasmid pwks <dig> and the high-copy plasmid pcr-xl-topo. y. pestis kim6+ carrying pwks130::yitr  or pcr-xl-topo::yitr  had increased levels of yita and yipa proteins following growth in bhi at 22°c compared to wild-type kim6+  and kim6+Δyita-yipb  . yita and yipa protein increased with an increase in yitr copy number . the sizes of the yita and yipb protein produced by all the strains under environmental conditions were similar . no detectable yita or yipa protein was produced by the kim6+Δyitr deletion mutant .

in vitro production of yita and yipa by y. pestis is dependent on growth temperature but not on culture medium
y. pestis kim6+, kim6+ , and kim6+  were grown in bhi at 10°c, 22°c, 28°c, or 37°c overnight to determine yita and yipa synthesis at different growth temperatures. yita production in parental kim6+ was detected after growth at 10°c . full-size yipa was not detected in kim6+ at any temperature . when plasmid pwks130::yitr was present, yita was seen at all temperatures, with the maximum level at 10°c; the level decreased when the growth temperature was 37°c . when plasmid pwks130::yitr was present, yipa production was also greatest after growth at 10°c  and decreased when the growth temperature was 37°c ; however, very little was seen at 37°c and the larger molecular weight band was no longer present . y. pestis kim6+ with the high-copy number pcr-xl-topo::yitr had the greatest production of yita and yipa, which also decreased when the growth temperature was 37°c . for each of the strains tested, levels of yita and yipa were comparable after growth at 22°c or 28°c .

yita and yipa production following growth in both blood and rpmi  <dig> was equivalent to production following growth in bhi. yita and yipa were produced to the greatest extent after growth at 22°c in rpmi  <dig> and blood  and levels dramatically decreased following growth at 37°c . as with growth in bhi, y. pestis with the high-copy pcr-xl-topo::yitr had the greatest level of production  compared to kim6+ with the low-copy yitr plasmid and wild-type kim6+.

yita and yipa persist for several hours following a growth temperature shift to 37°c
yita and yipa levels over time following a temperature shift from 22°c to 37°c was determined by western blot analysis. yita and yipa synthesized by kim6+  following growth in bhi at 22°c were still present  <dig> hours after an upshift to 37°c . after  <dig> hours, a slight reduction in yita and yipa protein was seen in the 37°c culture compared to the matched culture maintained at 22°c . after  <dig> hours, there was a significant decrease in detectable yita and yipa  in the 37°c culture. after  <dig> hours at 37°c, only a small quantity of yita remained and no detectable yipa .

evidence for post-translational processing of yipa
two forms of yipa were typically detected by western blot: the predicted full-length protein at ~ <dig> kda and a smaller protein of ~ <dig> kda, with the smaller form often predominating . to determine which of the bands detected using anti-yipa serum correspond to the n-terminal region and the c-terminal region of yipa, y. pestis strains containing translational fusions of mature β-lactamase  to the c-terminus of yita or yipa were constructed . after overnight growth at 22°c, y. pestis yita-β-lactamase and yipa-β-lactamase with or without plasmid pcr-xl-topo::yitr were assayed by western blot. yita-β-lactamase was detected by anti-yita serum as a single band at ~ <dig> kda  with a light smear of smaller bands , whereas wild-type yita was detected around  <dig> kda . anti-β-lactamase antibody also detected full length yita-β-lactamase at ~ <dig> kda as a prominent band and a smear of several smaller bands .

anti-yipa serum detected yipa-β-lactamase as two prominent bands. the yipa-β-lactamase lower band at ~ <dig> kda  was the same size as the lower band seen with wild-type yipa . the upper band of yipa-β-lactamase was detected at ~ <dig> kda , whereas the upper band of wild-type yipa was detected at ~ <dig> kda . anti-β-lactamase antibody detected the upper ~ <dig> kda band corresponding to full-length yipa-β-lactamase . however, the lower ~ <dig> kda band was not detected by anti-β-lactamase antibody ; although a distinct band at ~ <dig> kda was detected by anti-β-lactamase antibody . this indicates that the yipa molecular weight band detected by anti-yipa at ~ <dig> kda  represents the n-terminus of yipa, whereas the smaller molecular weight band detected by anti-β-lactamase antibody  represents the c-terminal region of yipa fused to β-lactamase .

yita and yipa are localized in the outer membrane of y. pestis
to determine where yita and yipa are localized within y. pestis, cytoplasmic, periplasmic, inner membrane and outer membrane fractions were collected from kim6+ yita-β-lactamase  and kim6+ yipa-β-lactamase  grown in bhi overnight at 22°c. yita-β-lactamase was detected by anti-yita  and anti-β-lactamase  antibodies predominately in the outer membrane fraction  and to a lesser extent in the periplasm . wild-type yita was detected in the cytoplasmic, periplasmic, inner membrane and outer membrane fractions of kim6+ yipa-β-lactamase .

full length yipa-β-lactamase was detected by anti-yipa  and anti-β-lactamase antibodies predominately in the periplasm and outer membrane fractions  whereas the smaller  yipa band was only detected by anti-yipa serum and was present in all of the fractions at approximately the same concentration . similarly, full-length wild-type yipa was detected by anti-yipa serum primarily in the periplasm and outer membrane fractions , with the smaller  band present in all the fractions of kim6+ yita-β-lactamase . interestingly, the smaller  yipa β-lactamase band detected by anti-β-lactamase antibodies was predominately in the periplasm and inner membrane fractions  and only minimally present in the cytoplasm and outer membrane fractions of kim6+ yipa-β-lactamase . ail, a known outer membrane protein, was used as a loading and fractionation validation control and, as expected, was detected predominately in the outer membrane fractions of both bacterial strains. thus, although yita and yipa were detected in all of the fractions, the full length proteins are predominately localized within the periplasm and the outer membrane fractions. conversely, the n-terminus of processed yipa  appears equally in all fractions and some quantity of the c-terminal region of yipa-β-lactamase  may be retained within the inner membrane fraction.

immunofluorescence microscopy detected yita on the surface of paraformaldehyde fixed kim6+    but not on the surface of kim6+Δyita-yipb   . yipa could not be detected above background levels on the surface of kim6+   using anti-yipa serum .

evaluation of the role of tc proteins during y. pestis flea infection
to determine if the y. pestis tc proteins are important for survival within the flea or are required to produce a transmissible infection, we infected x. cheopis fleas with kim6+ or kim6+Δyita-yipb. in different experiments, fleas were fed on blood containing a low infectious dose  or a high infectious dose  of kim6+ or kim6+Δyita-yipb per ml and were maintained for  <dig> weeks. as expected, infection rates and the incidence of proventricular blockage increased with the number of bacteria in the infectious blood meal, but there were no differences in these rates between fleas infected with kim6+ or with kim6+Δyita-yipb . the average bacterial load per infected flea was also similar for the two strains. thus, although highly produced in the flea gut, the y. pestis tc proteins do not appear to be necessary to establish a normal transmissible infection in the insect vector.

discussion
in this study, we show that yita and yipa proteins are highly produced by y. pestis isolated from the flea vector x. cheopis but not by y. pestis grown in vitro unless the positive regulator yitr is over-expressed . this is consistent with microarray data showing a 6– <dig> fold increase in tc gene expression in the flea, compared to y. pestis grown in culture at the same temperature  <cit> . previous data showed that deletion of yitr reduced tc protein synthesis  <cit> . additionally, expression of yitr is also upregulated in the flea  <cit> . thus, we added yitr to y. pestis on a low-copy and a high-copy plasmid, and found that the greatest levels of yita and yipa were seen when yitr was present on the high-copy number plasmid . furthermore, consistent with previous quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results  <cit> , we found that deletion of yitr dramatically reduced yita and yipa levels after growth in the flea . this validates the premise that yitr acts as a positive regulator of yita and yipa expression in vivo. since yita and yipa were not detected in culture-grown y. pestis kim6+ and collection of sufficient bacteria from fleas for multiple experiments is not feasible, the use of yitr over-producing strains were used judiciously to further study yita and yipa.

y. pseudotuberculosis tc proteins were preferentially produced after growth at 28–37°c but not at 15°c  <cit> . y. pestis tc proteins have also been shown to be produced after growth at 30°c  <cit> . however, microarray data indicate that y. pestis tc yit genes are preferentially transcribed at 21°c or 26°c and down-regulated  after growth at 37°c  <cit> . this thermoregulation is also seen with y. enterocolitica w <dig> tc genes, which show a preference for low-temperature expression and have markedly down-regulated expression at 37°c  <cit> . correspondingly, our data show that yita and yipa are both thermoregulated in kim6+, with the greatest production during growth at lower temperatures and only minimal production during growth at 37°c . furthermore, yita and yipa underwent similar thermoregulation after growth in both rpmi  <dig> and blood . thus, yita and yipa would not be expected to play a role in y. pestis pathogenesis late in the course of mammalian infection. this is supported by gene expression data from y. pestis isolated from rat bubos that show no detectable expression of yitr, and ~2- <dig> fold less expression of yita, b, c and yipb than y. pestis isolated from fleas  <cit> . however, yita,-b,-c were all found to be upregulated  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold by y. pestis within j774a. <dig> macrophage-like cells compared to bacteria grown in cell culture medium under the same conditions  <cit> , indicating that the optimum environment for tc protein production at 37°c may be within host phagocytes.

western blot analysis of yita and yipa proteins from y. pestis reveals potential processing of yipa . yipa was consistently detected by anti-yipa serum as two distinct protein bands of ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda . from the amino acid sequence, yipa is predicted to be ~ <dig> kda. thus, yipa may be present as a full-length protein and a processed variant. we show that an anti-β-lactamase antibody only detected the ~135-kda full-length yipa-β-lactamase protein but not the lower weight band expected at ~ <dig> kda  . this indicates that the 73-kda band detected with anti-yipa serum is the n-terminus of the processed yipa. in support of this, the anti-β-lactamase antibody also detected a prominent smaller band which migrated a little over half the distance between  <dig> and  <dig> kda at ~ <dig> kda. this band would correspond with the cleaved c-terminus of yipa  bound to β-lactamase . although both yipa bands were consistently seen in repeat experiments, there were smaller variable bands and smearing often seen using anti-yipa antibody and anti-β-lactamase antibodies. this suggests that the processed yipa is not stable and may undergo degradation under our assay conditions. the processed state of these proteins under natural conditions is difficult to explore due to limitations in the collection of bacteria from fleas. nonetheless, the n and c-terminal regions of yita and yipa contain predicted domains . the n-terminus of yita contains a domain that shares similarity with the salmonella virulence plasmid a  protein family. the yipa amino acid sequence indicates two conserved domains, including an n-terminus that shares similarity with the rhs protein family reported in cell envelope biogenesis and outer membrane proteins. the yipa rhsa domain is predicted to be approximately  <dig>  kda, which corresponds to the n-terminal band of yipa at ~ <dig> kda. in addition, the yipa c-terminus contains a single predicted protein tyrosine phosphatase  containing domain . thus, it is plausible that yipa is specifically processed for intracellular trafficking to the outer membrane, secretion, or formation of the tc protein complex and proper activity. additional studies are necessary to determine the significance of yipa processing events.

our data show a significant upregulation of the tc genes in the flea ; however, a functional role for the tc proteins has not been established. since an infectious dose of greater than  <dig>  bacteria is required to infect ~50% of fleas  <cit> , fleas are often fed on a heavily infected blood meal  to ensure adequate infection. although these levels of infection are likely seen by fleas feeding on septicemic animals  <cit> , fleas may also feed for a shorter duration or on animals with significantly lower numbers of y. pestis in the blood. under conditions where fewer y. pestis are initially present within the flea, additional y. pestis factors, such as the tc proteins, may play a more significant role in facilitating survival within the flea and subsequent preventricular blockage and transmission. thus, we fed fleas on blood containing a low and mid initial dose  of wild-type kim6+ or kim6+Δyita-yipb. however, even at the lowest initial infectious dose, there were no significant differences between kim6+ and kim6+Δyita-yipb , demonstrating that the tc proteins are not essential for survival within the flea or for normal proventricular blockage. this is consistent with observations made from fleas infected with a blood meal containing ~ <dig>  x  <dig> cfu/ml of the kim6+Δyitr mutant  <cit> . thus, the y. pestis tc proteins are not essential for survival within or to produce a normal transmissible infection in the oriental rat flea x. cheopis. however, it is possible that the tc proteins are important in survival within or transmission from other flea species.

although we were unable to detect any phenotype in the flea, we were able to localize yita and yipa to the outer membrane  and yita to the surface  of y. pestis. thus, they could play a role in infectivity in the mammalian host after transmission. although the significance of this is yet to be determined, y. pestis from fleas are resistant to phagocytosis and killing by murine and human neutrophils  <cit> , and the tc proteins were implicated in resistance of y. pestis isolated from fleas to phagocytosis by macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, the tc proteins  were secreted into culture supernatant, sf <dig> cells, raw macrophages, and hela cells in a t3ss-dependent manner  <cit> . however, y. pseudotuberculosis tcdb protein was detected in both  <dig> and 37°c culture supernatants  <cit> , indicating a t3ss-independent mechanism of tc protein secretion. although we saw minimal production of yita and yipa after prolonged growth at 37°c, they persisted for several hours after temperature upshift. therefore, it is plausible that y. pestis tc proteins produced by y. pestis while in the flea are translocated into mammalian host cells upon transmission, where they act to disrupt the host immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
y. pestis encodes homologues to the p. luminescens insecticidal toxins which are highly expressed within the flea vector. however, our data show that y. pestis tc proteins, unlike p. luminescens toxins  <cit> , are not toxic to fleas and are not essential for survival within the flea midgut or in blockage of the proventriculus. thus, our data indicate that y. pestis tc proteins have evolved to limit toxicity to their insect vector. although the y. pestis tc proteins may play a yet unidentified important role in survival in the environment, the fact that high levels of yita and yipa protein are produced by y. pestis while in the flea, and that yita was identified on the bacterial surface, in addition to other evidence to date  <cit> , suggests that they are more active against mammalian than insect cells. thus, y. pestis tc proteins may have evolved to play a role in subversion of the mammalian immune response, plausibly through resistance to phagocytic cells of the innate immune system or in intracellular survival. furthermore, our data suggest that since the y. pestis tc proteins are minimally produced after growth in culture compared to growth in the flea, virulence studies to date using y. pestis grown in broth are inadequate to determine the contribution of tc proteins, and other proteins specifically upregulated during growth in the flea, in transmission and virulence. thus, experiments using y. pestis over-producing yitr are underway to determine if the tc proteins play a role in pathogenicity. additionally, experiments to determine if y. pestis tc proteins are secreted or translocated into host neutrophils via the t3ss and their effect on neutrophil phagocytosis and killing are being performed.
