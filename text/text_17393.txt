BACKGROUND
est analysis has opened up exciting prospects for gene discovery in all organisms, irrespective of their genome size  <cit> . large-scale mapping of est unique genes can provide valuable insights into the organization of genomes and chromosomes  <cit> . est distribution in relation to chromosome landmarks  and recombination is important in comparative analysis of chromosome structure and evolution, gene isolation, and targeted genome sequencing for large genome species such as wheat  <cit> . at present, most ests are from cdna libraries, but est identification and localization are laborious and time consuming, especially for polyploid plants because of the large genome size and serious interference of homologous sequences. construction of single-chromosome or chromosome-region est library could be an efficient strategy to isolate important ests located on specific chromosomes and/or specific chromosomal regions.

there are several reports on isolation of ests directly from specific chromosomes and/or specific chromosomal regions, most of which were on est isolation from human chromosomes or chromosome segments by using microdissected chromosome dna as probes to screen ests from a cdna library  <cit> . ests of microdissected chromosomes had been isolated successfully by using microdissection-mediated cdna capture  <cit> .

plant chromosome microdissection and microcloning have been studied for more than  <dig> years. many chromosome-specific dna libraries from different plant species, such as wheat  <cit> , oat  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and beet  <cit> , have been constructed using this strategy. our group has constructed several plant chromosome- and chromosome region-specific dna libraries and has isolated ests that are disease-related genes  <cit> .

as an important genetic resource of major cereal crop species, rye  has good adaptability to extreme climatic and soil conditions. rye is also known to have the lowest requirements for chemical treatments like fertilizers or pesticides, which makes it an ecologically and economically desirable crop for specific regions, for example, in northern europe  <cit> . chromosome 1r, which has been shown to carry genes for resistance to powdery mildew  <cit> , stem rust  <cit> , leaf rust  <cit> , yellow rust  <cit> , and greenbug  <cit> , especially attracted scientists' attention.

to date, a high-resolution linkage map of rye has not been established owing to its large genome   <cit> , high content of repetitive sequences and the insufficiency of molecular markers. for the same reasons, constructing the est map of the whole rye genome is inefficient and time consuming.

it is well known that rye chromosome 1r contains a large number of resistance genes. sa is a critical signal for the activation of both local and systemic acquired resistance  and can induce the expression of some resistance genes   <cit> . recent evidence suggests that sa also regulates cell death, possibly via a positive feedback loop that involves reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

hsa technique is based on the suppressive pcr principle, which selects and amplifies the common sequences of two complex dna samples. the use of oligonucleotide adaptors that form strong clamps ensures the specificity of the method, such that only fragments with two different adaptors will be amplified, whereas fragments with one type of adaptor will not be selected for amplification due to the suppressive effect on pcr of the adaptors  <cit> . in this research, we developed a new method to rapidly isolate ests from rye leaves, with and without sa induction, by using the microdissection of chromosome 1r combined with hsa. the method developed in this research to clone ests of specific chromosome has not been reported before. it would be a useful method to investigate genes on specific chromosomes. the obtained ests reported here should be useful to further clone the new genes on chromosome 1r.

RESULTS
procedures to isolate expressed sequences of a specific chromosome
the procedures of this method are shown in figure  <dig>  the strategy of this method is the combination of chromosome microdissection method and hsa technique  <cit>  to yield the homologous sequences between microdissected dna and cdna. as shown in figure  <dig>  after degenerated oligonuleotide-primed pcr  of microdissected chromosomes, amplified microdissect dna and cdna are digested by sau3ai and linked with two kinds of adaptors, respectively. the adaptors and primers described above are designed from suppression subtractive hybridization   <cit> , with a change of the blunt ends into annealing ends of sau3ai. the two samples were separately denatured and annealed for  <dig> h, then mixed and annealed together for another  <dig> h. three kinds of hybrid chains were generated: dna-dna hybrid chains, dna-cdna hybrid chains, and cdna-cdna hybrid chains. finally, a two-step pcr amplification is performed to select the hybridized fraction of the samples. only the dna-cdna hybrid chains, which came from different samples with different adaptors, could be exponentially amplified. because of the palindrome structure of the adaptors, the dna-dna and cdna-cdna chains formed the panhandle structure during the amplification. thus, they could not be further amplified.

microdissection of chromosome 1r, its dna amplification and characterization
five 1r chromosomes were successfully microdissected and amplified with two rounds of dop-pcr. the size of the second round pcr products ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, with predominant fragments in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  kb . the positive control, using  <dig> pg of genomic rye dna as template, had a brighter and wider band ranging in size from  <dig>  to <dig>  kb . no product was obtained from the negative control , which did not contain any added template dna so that was used to monitor any possible contamination.

in order to verify the origin of pcr products, the amplified products were hybridized with dig-labeled rye genomic dna. hybridization signals were observed only in the positive control and the amplified products from chromosome 1r , indicating that the microdissected chromosomes came indeed from the rye genome. furthermore, the intense band for amplified chromosome 1r product in an agarose gel  was recovered, purified and sequenced. the fragment of  <dig> bp in size was obtained. when compared with the data in genbank, it was identical to the dispersed repeat sequence r173- <dig>  of secale cereale, which was previously located on chromosome 1rs  <cit> . this confirmed that the amplified dna product was truly from microdissected chromosome 1r.

hybridization between chromosome 1r dna and cdna of rye and suppression amplification
the chromosome 1r dna generated by dop-pcr was linked with adaptor hsa <dig> and hybridized with hsa2-linked cdna of rye plants with and without sa treatment, respectively. after hybridization, the hybridized fragments between chromosome 1r dna and cdna of rye were amplified by two rounds of suppression pcr using single primer p <dig> or p <dig>  double primers p <dig> + p <dig>  single primer pn <dig> or pn <dig>  and double primers pn <dig> + pn <dig>  p <dig> and pn <dig> were corresponding to hsa <dig>  and p <dig> and pn <dig> were corresponding to hsa <dig>  the relationship between or among those primers was shown in figure  <dig>  there were no evident pcr products when single primer p <dig> or p <dig> or double primers p <dig> + p <dig> were used in the first round of pcr. in the second round pcr, there were neither evident pcr products when single primer pn <dig> or pn <dig> was used, whereas pcr products ranging from approximately  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp were obtained when double primers pn <dig> + pn <dig> were used . these results indicated that hybridization and suppression were successful in the experiment.

generation of ests of chromosome 1r and analysis of sequenced ests
pcr products amplified with double primers pn <dig> and pn <dig> were cloned into pmd18-t vector . there were about  <dig> recombinant clones in each plate. a total of  <dig> recombinant clones were randomly selected from the 1r-chromosome est libraries of rye leaves with and without sa induction. of these,  <dig> clones were from sa-induced leaves. the inserts were released by pcr with pn <dig> and pn <dig> primers and sequenced . the  <dig> sequenced inserts, excluding the primer sequences, ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp.

of the  <dig> sequenced inserts,  <dig> were contaminated sequences ,  <dig> redundant ones, and  <dig> unique ones. these were named, registered, and analyzed with a blast search in the genbank/embl database. results are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  chromosome 1r dna possessed primer pn <dig>  whereas rye cdnas possessed primer pn <dig>  those sequences possessed both primers pn <dig> and pn <dig>  were successfully isolated.

of the  <dig> unique inserts,  <dig> of them were expressed without sa treatment  and  <dig> of them were sa-induced . these sequences were divided into two classes:  <dig> known sequences, which are homologous with existing est sequences in the genbank database , and  <dig> unknown sequences, which had no hits in the genbank/embl database. of the known sequences, all are homologous with ests or genes from rye, wheat and barley;  <dig> have been located to specific chromosomes  –  <dig> on chromosome 1r of rye  <cit> , one on all  <dig> chromosomes of rye  <cit> , and  <dig> on homologous group  <dig> of wheat  <cit> . this unequivocally demonstrated that the ests of chromosome 1r could be isolated by our newly developed method.

among the recombinant clones, the redundancy is 11% . the most frequently sequenced inserts were rye clone f <dig> hypervariable dna sequences, genes encoding barley beta-ketoacyl-acp synthase  <cit> , and barley phosphate transporter hvpt <dig> 

of the  <dig> sequences obtained from leaves of rye plants without sa induction, 45% were genes related to biotic and abiotic stresses, 35% were not related to biotic and abiotic stresses, and 20% were unknown. compared with the functional categories of ests from rye leaves without sa induction, the ests related to temperature induction and the unknown ests were increased by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, in sa-treated plants; whereas general ests, the disease-induced ests and resistance protein  decreased by  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .

characterization of recombinant clones by dot blot hybridization
the recombinant plasmid dnas of randomly selected recombinant clones were hybridized with dig-labeled chromosome 1r secondary dop-pcr product, cdna of rye seedlings at three-leaf-stage with sa induction, and rye genomic dna. nearly all  recombinant plasmid dnas could be hybridized with chromosome 1r dop-pcr product , indicating that the inserts in recombinant plasmid dnas are homologous with chromosome 1r dna. the hybridization signals were weaker when the recombinant plasmid dnas were hybridized with cdna of rye seedlings, although some clones had stronger signals . not coincidental, these are those clones having stronger signals in hybridization with chromosome 1r dop-pcr product. whereas, there were only very weak and/or no hybridization signals when the recombinant clones were hybridized with rye genomic dna . these results indicate that all the recombinant clones are present in the rye genome in single and/or low copy, a characteristic for expressed genes.

discussion
est analysis is an efficient way to clone important new genes controlling biotic and abiotic stress resistance and other desirable traits in plants  <cit> . millions of ests from plants have been registered in the genbank database. at present, most ests are from cdna libraries of different tissues at different developmental stages. however, est identification and mapping is laborious and time consuming, especially for polyploid plants because of the large genome size and serious interference of homologous sequences. many important genes have been located on specific chromosomes and/or specific regions of chromosomes by traditional genetics and modern molecular techniques  <cit> . therefore, cloning ests from specific chromosomes or specific regions of chromosomes could be an efficient method to obtain the desirable genes.

in this research we developed a new method to clone the ests from a specific chromosome of plants. some of the amplified dnas should contain polya tail and some did not, but all were expressed genes derived from the microdissected chromosome 1r of rye. our results prove that this strategy is correct and working. all  <dig> isolated unique fragments have the primer sequences from two different adaptors,  <dig> of the  <dig> fragments are ests with polya tail and  <dig> are without. six sequences had been located on chromosome 1r of rye and/or on homologous group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat. this clearly demonstrated that the ests of chromosome 1r could be isolated by our newly developed method.

several methods to isolate chromosome-expressed sequences  or ests had been previously reported. first, in the probe screening method, ces were obtained by dot hybridization on membranes using dna fragments derived from chromosome- specific library as probes to screen cdna library or using cdna fragments as the probe to screen chromosome-specific library. by using this method, ces had been successfully isolated from humans and animals  <cit> . although the reliability is high, this method is time consuming because of the numerous cloning operations and hybridized clone selections. second, in the hybrid selection method  <cit> , ces were isolated using cdnas to hybridize genomic dna pools that were generated by microdissection of the human chromosome 12qhsr region and immobilized on a nylon membrane, followed by pcr amplification of hybridized fragments. the chromosome dna was fixed on the membrane to avoid the numerous cloning operations, and the selection sensitivity was improved. but due to the complexity of cdna, more false positives would occur and many low-abundance cdna would be lost. wei et al.  <cit>  discovered that only 1/ <dig> of clones were single/low-copy fragments by using this method. third, in the microdissection-mediated cdna capture method, the ces could be obtained using cdna with adaptors to hybridize the chromosomes in situ on coverslips, followed by microdissection of hybridized chromosomes and/or specific chromosome region and subsequent amplification using the adaptors-linked cdna as the primers  <cit> . avoiding the amplification of chromosome dna, this method is rapid and ingenious but the false positive rate is high. actually, both of the last two methods are suitable for the ces enrichment. in our newly developed method that is based on chromosome microdissection, dna-cdna hybridization in liquid and suppressive pcr, many ests or ces can be simultaneously isolated. compared with the first three above-mentioned methods, our method is more convenient, economical, efficient, and easy to control. in our method, ests or ces can be obtained without dna  library construction and dot  hybridization.

in previous works, chromosome-specific dnas were mainly amplified by linker-adaptor pcr  and dop-pcr. by la-pcr, amplified chromosome-specific dnas were usually longer, but the coverage ratio was lower, than those obtained by dop-pcr  <cit> . we used dop-pcr to amplify chromosome 1r dna to obtain expressed sequences ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length. most of these sequences provided enough information to be compared with ests in the genbank database, although they are shorter than those obtained by the probe screening method  <cit> .

dna-cdna hybridization always suffers from a common imperfection: mismatched strands will frequently appear due to the introns of genes. this disadvantage led to observations that the hybridized sequences were not all necessarily the expressed sequences  <cit> . in this study, we used the single-strand-specific dna and rna endonuclease mung bean nuclease to cleave the partially mismatched strands. figure  <dig> shows the entire procedure of clearing up the introns of the hybrid products by the mismatch-sensitive mung bean nuclease. mung bean nuclease has high specificity for single-stranded dna and rna; it is the enzyme of choice for most applications requiring a single-strand-specific nuclease  <cit> . theoretically, the introns will not hybridize with cdnas and will form loops, and the loops will finally be digested by the mung bean nuclease, and the influence of the introns could be avoided. in this research, none of the isolated ests contained introns. it was shown that the mung bean nuclease digested the introns efficiently. in all previous research on isolating ces or ests, this endonuclease was not used to solve the problem.

during chromosome microdissection, contamination that originates from any dna of cytoplasm and other species is always a serious problem  <cit> . amplification of contaminating dna will greatly influence the quality of chromosome-specific dna libraries. however, the sequencing results here did not show any serious contamination originating from alien dna. the reason might be that only the hybridized dna-cdna sequences could be detected and amplified during the procedure of the hsa. the contaminant dnas could not be amplified because they could not be hybridized with chromosome 1r dna and/or cdna of rye leaves. our results suggested that the hsa technique in our newly developed method could suppress the amplification of contaminant dnas.

sa is known to be a signal molecule in acquired resistance to pathogens in several species  <cit> . it can be used to induce the synthesis of certain pathogenesis-related  proteins and to enhance resistance to pathogens  <cit> . janda et al.  <cit>  discovered that the addition of  <dig>  mm sa to the hydroponic growth solution of young maize plants under normal growth conditions provided protection against subsequent low temperature  stress. in our study, sa induction significantly increased the ests related to temperature induction and the unknown ests, whereas decreased general ests, the disease-induced ests and resistance protein . the sa treatment time may be the main reason for the reduced numbers of ests associated with disease resistance because different genes may need different durations of sa treatment to achieve significant expression  <cit> . in this research, we only use a single treatment duration  for the sa treatment. presumably, the treatment for  <dig> h may be unsuitable for the expression of some disease resistance genes. moreover, the fact that the unknown ests increased after sa induction should be intriguing. some of these unknown ests may be new genes associated with disease resistance. they were not classified into the resistance genes because their functions were unknown. these unknown ests need to be investigated.

finding new genes and detecting their functions are the goals of most genetic research. in fact, the unknown sequences are the most interesting part of this research. in this study, we got  <dig> unknown sequences  and  <dig> known sequences, which shared high-degrees of homology with existing est sequences in the genbank database. the former provide opportunities to clone new genes from chromosome 1r of rye. although the method we described here has the disadvantage of having short inserts, the combination of microdissection and microcloning with a recently developed technique, polymerase cloning , could be a potential way to solve this problem. zhang et al.  <cit>  reported a ploning method, which is a sequencing strategy that eliminates culturing of microorganisms by using real-time isothermal amplification to form plones from the dna of a single cell. they reported that the single-cell e. coli library had  <dig> % coverage of the genome and with inserts up to  <dig> kb. by using phi <dig> polymerase and the n <dig> primer, the plones led to less amplification bias and larger insert fragments  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, an efficient way to clone ests from a specific chromosome of a plant was established in this research. it would be a useful method for genomic and functional genomics research of plants, especially for the polyploidy species. ninty-four ests from the chromosome 1r of rye were cloned, sequenced and analyzed. these sequences should be useful in gene expression studies of chromosome 1r of rye plants at the seedling stage either with or without sa induction. based on our results, it should also be possible to clone the new genes on chromosome 1r and elucidate their functions in future studies.
