BACKGROUND
trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and n'gana in cattle, and has a major economic and morbidity impact across much of africa  <cit> . the principal mechanism of immune evasion in the mammalian host is antigenic variation, sequential expression of immunologically distinct variant surface glycoproteins  at the cell surface  <cit> , but additional mechanisms, including manipulation of the host immune system and antibody clearance from the surface also participate  <cit> . the full impact of these mechanisms on virulence is not understood at this time. the mammalian part of the life cycle is complex, involving penetration of multiple tissue spaces in the mammalian host, encompassing the bloodstream, lymphatic system and central nervous systems. despite morphological similarities between mammalian forms, it is unknown if a developmental stimulus is required for tissue tropism or if this results from stochastic events. further, differentiation to the procyclic insect form on entering the tsetse fly vector is accompanied by massive cellular remodeling, including replacement of the vsg coat with procyclins, a family of acidic glycoproteins, activation of the mitochondrion, changes to cellular and organelle morphology, altered cell cycle checkpoints and attenuation of endocytic activity  <cit> . multiple stages have been described during fly infection, with clear changes in morphology and surface antigen expression  <cit> . how these alterations are controlled at the transcriptional level remains unclear; for example each form could represent a distinct developmental stage, implying stimulus-driven differentiation, or result from transcriptome flexibility, allowing modulation of levels of certain transcripts in response to altered conditions.

polycistronic transcription in trypanosomes  <cit>  precludes promoter-driven control of transcription, while specific degradation appears to be the major mechanism underpinning regulation of mrna steady state levels. microarray hybridization and real time  pcr methods can monitor steady-state rna levels, and are independent of mechanisms controlling mrna abundance. an earlier whole genome microarray study  <cit>  identified ~2% of orfs as developmentally regulated, but several developmentally regulated factors, including the clathrin heavy chain and rab <dig>  <cit>  were not detected in that analysis.

membrane trafficking is a defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells, playing major roles in nutrient uptake, turnover, signalling, immune defence, apoptosis and many other processes. mechanisms regulating transport remain only partly understood in any organism, but transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes are all implicated, with changes in transcription  <cit> , complex kinase integration  <cit> , and formation of multiple protein-protein interactions  <cit>  contributing to control. further, copious evidence implicates small gtpases in regulating distinct aspects of transport, including rabs in vesicle fusion  <cit> , arfs in regulation of membrane coat systems  <cit>  and rho-related proteins in cytoskeletal interactions  <cit> . expression profiling for multiple human and mouse tissues indicates correlations between expression of certain rabs and the snares, adaptors, and other proteins with which they interact  <cit>  and facilitates construction of potential interaction hubs and prediction of novel pathways.

understanding of membrane transport is comparatively advanced in trypanosomes  <cit> , and various cellular changes are associated with life cycle progression  <cit> , most notably an order of magnitude increase in endocytic activity in the mammalian infective bloodstream form  versus the insect procyclic  stages  <cit> . increased endocytic activity in the bsf is likely related to immune evasion  <cit> . by contrast, knowledge of trypanosome signal transduction is poor  <cit> . few ras-like gtpases or their corresponding regulatory factors are present in trypanosomes, heterotrimeric gtpases are absent and there are no obvious receptor-type tyrosine kinases  <cit> . there is a complex predicted trypanosome kinome  <cit>  but limited understanding as to how signaling is mediated via these factors  <cit> . there is evidence for phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling, but this is comparatively unexplored  <cit> , and a large novel family of receptor-coupled adenylate cyclases in kinetoplastids argues for significant environmental sensing via novel mechanisms  <cit> .

we selected the trypanosome trafficking system as a clear example of a developmentally regulated process, where sufficient data are available for meaningful investigation of transcriptome changes. using microarray analysis and quantitative rt-pcr, we assessed developmental regulation of trypanosome membrane transport and transcriptional flexibility by targeted genetic manipulation and altered environmental conditions designed to modulate trafficking pathways. from work in other organisms, we anticipated the involvement of protein kinases, small gtpases and, in the case of the unfolded protein response , a system that responds to increased concentrations of non-native polypeptides within the endoplasmic reticulum, clear evidence for a transcriptional mechanism. our data indicates developmental remodeling of the transcriptome, but essentially no response to altered conditions.

RESULTS
microarray design
due to limitations of orf assignment for specific spots of the previously described whole genome microarray platform  <cit> , we designed a more targeted and fully validated array to address developmental regulation of the trafficking system in t. brucei. major classes of proteins involved in membrane transport include small gtpases, vesicle coats proteins, kinases and phosphatases, motility factors mediating movement of vesicles along cytoskeletal elements, tethering factors for binding of vesicles to target membranes, snare proteins, escrts and numerous other molecules involved in protein sorting and membrane deformation. the trypanosome genome was parsed extensively for such factors  <cit>  and, based on these and additional searches, a subgenome microarray was constructed. the array also included putative er chaperones, peptidases bearing an er signal peptide and potentially involved in degradation within the trafficking system, homologues of kinases implicated in membrane traffic in other systems  <cit> , sphingolipid biosynthesis enzymes with roles in exocytosis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored proteins, as well as trypanosome-specific surface antigens, e.g. barp, cram, and the invariant surface glycoprotein family, or isgs  <cit> . in addition we also included oligonucleotides against esag <dig> and esag <dig>  which encode the trypanosome transferrin receptor, a molecule reported to exhibit expression that is modulated by growth conditions  <cit> .

 <dig> orfs in the t. brucei genome with a potential role in membrane trafficking were identified, representing ~8% of the predicted protein coding potential. representatives of most components of the major gene families are found in the t. brucei genome, but notable exceptions are the absence of several coat systems  <cit> , a relatively small number of gtpases and associated factors  <cit> , and the absence of bar and sh <dig> domains; bar domains are used extensively for membrane deformation in higher eukaryotes  <cit> , while the absence of sh <dig> domains may indicate limited or unconventional signalling through protein tyrosine kinase pathways  <cit> . apart from clustering of multicopy genes, there is no location bias for a specific chromosome or region within a chromosome for these orfs . an additional  <dig> orfs were also included as a reference. the first array , used for comparison of life stages and analysis of rab <dig> isoform over-expression, comprised  <dig> oligonucleotides,  <dig> of which targeted reference orfs. a modified array , used for all other analyses, included an additional  <dig> oligonucleotides. the vast majority of oligonucelotides are gene-specific but some are expected to hybridise to multiple transcripts from multicopy genes .

overview of differential expression between trypanosome life-stages
we extracted rna from exponentially growing cultures of t. brucei bloodstream and procyclic forms, labelled and competitively hybridised the cdna to the microarray. as expected, the majority of genes were equivalently expressed in the two life stages, but a small cohort did present significant differential expression . the heat-map  indicates that the data for the most significantly developmentally regulated genes are highly reproducible across all replicates .

to identify which mrnas are differentially expressed, limma and fspma packages were used to interrogate the data  <cit> . for comparison with previous work  <cit> , ratios above  <dig>   were considered highly significant. using this threshold, 8% of the genes represented on the array are upregulated in bsf and 5% in pcf, but excluding the reference set these numbers reduce to 4% in bsf and 2% in pcf. using a whole genome microarray, brems and cowrokers found only 2% of trypanosome genes were developmentally regulated, and while different pre-processing steps, in both mrna preparation and data analysis, make direct comparison difficult, the present data suggest that the trafficking cohort likely exhibits bias in developmental regulation. there is also greater upregulation in bsfs compared to pcfs, consistent with increased activity in the trafficking system in bloodstream stages  <cit> . brems et al. found  <dig> genes upregulated in pcf and  <dig> in bsf while, using the same threshold, the present analysis identifies  <dig> upregulated in pcf and  <dig> in bsf, from a much smaller cohort. these data suggest that significant transcriptional level remodelling of the membrane trafficking system accompanies life-cycle progression in trypanosomes.

strongly developmentally regulated genes include several reference orfs with known regulated expression, i.e mrnas for procyclin, trans-sialidase, cram, cap <dig>  and cap <dig>  are increased in pcf, while esag <dig>  esag <dig>  isg <dig>  isg <dig>  gpi-plc, and cap <dig> are upregulated in bsf . these data are fully consistent with previous work and support the validity of the microarray approach for identifying previously uncharacterised developmentally expressed genes. rab <dig>  also developmentally regulated  <cit> , gave an expression ratio below  <dig>  by both limma and fspma analysis. hence, analysis using a more relaxed threshold to identify developmentally regulated mrnas was also used. table  <dig> lists all orfs which either gave a ratio above  <dig>   by limma or fspma analysis, or which had a b-statistic value greater than  <dig>  in limma, indicating statistical significance in differential expression, despite a low relative expression ratio. excluding the reference set,  <dig> genes with a possible role in membrane transport are differentially expressed in t. brucei;  <dig> upregulated in bsf,  <dig> in pcf, i.e. 8% and 5% respectively.

orfs represented by oligonucleotides on the array which gave a pcf to bsf expression ratio  or bsf to pcf expression  greater than two by limma or fpmsa analysis, or which had a value of over one for the b statistic in limma are shown. limma ratios which correspond to a b value of > <dig> are given in bold. for candidates validated by qrt-pcr, the resulting qrt-pcr ratio is also given. ratios below two may not be significant. the names of well-characterised genes which can be used as controls to validate the array results are in bold. asterisk indicates oligonucleotides that hybridise with mrna derived from more than one orf .

25% of the most significantly developmentally regulated genes were validated by qrt-pcr analysis, using the same mrna samples as used for the microarray analysis. the vast majority of orfs tested exhibited congruence between qrt-pcr and microarray analysis, i.e. differential regulation in the same direction . significantly, all orfs with a ratio above  <dig>  on the array also gave a significant ratio  in qrt-pcr. two genes with known developmental regulation, the clathrin heavy chain  <cit>  and tbmsp-a  <cit> , did not demonstrate significant differential regulation by microarray analysis, but highly significant ratios were obtained by qrt-pcr . various factors may be responsible for this array artefact, which were not pursued further; however these data specifically highlight examples of false-negative data in microarray analysis.

differential expression of trafficking factors in trypanosomes
considering the differentially expressed genes by functional class indicates that a broad remodelling accompanies differentiation, i.e. developmental changes are not restricted to specific protein classes or pathways. specifically, members of the chaperones, some proteases and non-pi kinases are upregulated in pcf, while the small gtpases, additional proteases, snare proteins and pi kinases represent the major factors upregulated in bsfs . an increased requirement for chaperones may be due to the greater heterogeneity of the procyclic cell surface compared to the bloodstream form, the latter being dominated by vsg. a differential requirement for secretory pathway proteases is consistent with distinct roles for these molecules between the two life stages, while upregulation of both small gtpases and snare proteins in bsfs is broadly consistent with increased activity within the trafficking system in the mammalian stage.

specificity and control factors
the most abundantly expressed small gtpases at the mrna level are ran, arl3a, both rab1a and rab1b, and several members of the arf subfamily . ran is a very abundant protein in most cells, while high expression of arf <dig>  rab <dig>  and arl3a possibly suggest a considerable emphasis on flux through the er and golgi complex and flagellum biogenesis respectively  <cit> . developmentally expressed small gtpases are restricted to the bsf. this cohort includes markers for the recycling endosome, rab <dig>  <cit> , the endosomes/golgi, tbarf <dig>  <cit> , and the flagellum, tbarl3a  <cit> . identification of rab <dig> is consistent with earlier work  <cit>  and our data provide the first evidence for developmental regulation of tbarf <dig> and tbarl3a. the data also identify rab1b, rabx <dig>  ras-like gtpases tbrx <dig> and tbrhp, and a putative gtpase with an hsr <dig> domain  as developmentally regulated; with no experimental information for these proteins the significance of these changes is not clear  <cit> . importantly, we see no strong developmental regulation for any of the putative gtpase-activating proteins  and guanine nucleotide exchange factors  included in the study. some developmental regulation of tbc family rab-gaps is detectable by qrt-pcr, but at levels unlikely to be detected by the array .

in addition to a number of small gtpases, including rab subfamily members, five predicted snare mrnas exhibit increased expression in bsfs . while no direct experimental information is available for these molecules, tb <dig> . <dig>  the most abundant qa snare at the mrna level , is likely involved in post-golgi transport on account of similarity to trans-golgi network  snares syp <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana and syntaxin16/tlg2p from s. cerevisiae  <cit> , while the l. major orthologue, lmjf <dig> , localises close to the golgi complex  <cit> . tb <dig> . <dig> and tb <dig> . <dig> are similar to the a. thaliana early endosomal snare vamp <dig> and the er-located syp <dig>  respectively  <cit> , while tb <dig> . <dig> and tb <dig> . <dig> do not display significant similarity to any specific snare. by contrast, tb <dig> . <dig>  is the only upregulated snare message in the procyclic stage, with weak similarity to aspergillus bos <dig>  suggesting a putative role in anterior transport from the er; tb <dig> . <dig> is also the most highly expressed qb snare . these data are suggestive of specific upregulation of mrnas encoding endocytic and exocytic snares in bsf, with evidence for limited pcf regulation of the secretory pathway. on average, qc and r snares are more highly expressed than qa and qb snares . the t. brucei n-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor , an atpase responsible for regulation of snare complex disassembly  <cit> , and a hypothetical protein similar to γ-soluble nsf attachment protein  are upregulated in bsf, which may indicate increased overall snare activity, but a further putative snap  is upregulated in pcf. interestingly, both tb <dig> . <dig>  and tb <dig> . <dig>  have severe rnai knockdown growth phenotypes  <cit> . expression of vps <dig>  a component of the hops tethering complex functioning at the late endosome, is increased in the bsf . overall, multiple factors likely to be controlling endocytic pathways, encompassing snares, rabs and possibly also the hops complex, appear more highly expressed in the bsf, consistent with earlier data but also suggesting more extensive remodelling than previously suspected.

coat proteins
the vast majority of vesicle coat factor mrnas are expressed at equivalent levels in both major life stages. of those that are regulated, most notable is the clathrin light chain, tb <dig> . <dig>  upregulated in bsf and in agreement with increased endocytosis in this life stage  <cit> . further, tb <dig> . <dig>  containing a predicted emp <dig> domain, suggesting a role as a cargo receptor in copii-mediated transport  <cit> , is upregulated in bsf, whereas a second emp24-related orf, tb <dig> . <dig>  is upregulated in pcf. should these proteins indeed represent emp <dig> isoforms, this expression profile indicates potential developmental-stage specific remodelling of copii cargo selection providing differentiation in er exit pathways.

a putative epsinr , is also significantly upregulated in bsf; epsinr is associated with clathrin coated vesicles and ap <dig>  <cit> . the ap <dig> subunit is significantly upregulated in bsf, but the μ-subunit of ap <dig>  is upregulated in pcf ; both complexes have a role in endosome to tgn transport. although no further adaptin components exhibit highly significant differential expression, a general trend of upregulation of ap <dig> component in bsfs and downregulation of ap <dig> and ap <dig> was evident on the microarray  which suggests developmental regulation. from previous analyses, the ap <dig> γ-subunit is constitutively expressed  <cit> , but the β-chain is upregulated in bsf  <cit> , suggesting possible subunit-specific regulation. to further confirm the significance of these data polyclonal antibodies were raised against the δ-subunit of ap <dig>  western blotting confirmed significant developmental regulation of ap3δ, with expression greatly augmented in the pcf . these data are also consistent with evidence suggesting increased emphasis on lysosomal trafficking in the pcf  <cit> .

proteases
several proteases are known components of the trypanosome surface and endocytic system or predicted to be, based on the presence of a signal peptide. the gp <dig> isoform tbmsp-b , is upregulated in pcf, while tbmsp-c  is upregulated in bsf , confirming previous analyses  <cit> . tbmsp-a, previously identified as bsf-specific  <cit> , is only slightly upregulated by microarray, but is validated strongly by qrt-pcr . further, metacaspase mca <dig>  showed significant upregulation in bsf, also confirming earlier data  <cit> . microarray data indicate that mca <dig>  is upregulated in pcf, but qrt-pcr data failed to validate this, suggesting more equivalent expression, also in agreement with earlier work  <cit> . two subtilysin-like serine peptidases , a caax prenyl protease , and a thimet oligopeptidase a  are upregulated in bsf. the thimet oligopeptidase tb <dig> . <dig> was recently suggested to play a role in dysregulated kinin metabolism observed in the plasma of trypanosome-infected hosts and to contribute to vascular lesions observed in african trypanosomiasis  <cit> , consistent with augmented expression in bsf.

the most abundant protease class message is for tb <dig> . <dig>  an l-cathepsin-like cysteine peptidase, and likely a lysosomal protein  <cit> , which appears equivalently expressed in both life stages . some of the developmentally regulated proteases are also abundant at the mrna level , namely msp-b , mca <dig> , a subtilysin-like serine peptidase , and thimet oligopeptidase a . hence the major proteolytic activity likely resides within the cysteine protease class, as previously reported  <cit> , but these new data suggest a significant level of developmental remodelling, as well as potential contributions from additional protease classes.

chaperones and er lumenal proteins
several putative er chaperones, likely to aid folding of secreted coat proteins, were also studied. of these, tb <dig> . <dig> is homologous to erp <dig>  a thioredoxin of the protein disulfide isomerase  family, which may have a role in controlling the redox state of the er, and is upregulated in bsf  <cit> . two additional pdi proteins are also upregulated in the bloodstream stage of t. brucei  <cit> , suggesting remodelling of these factors between life stages.

in the pcf stage, two predicted mitochondrial chaperones, an hsp <dig>  and an hsp <dig> , are upregulated, consistent both with previous data  <cit>  and increased mitochondrial activity  <cit> . additionally, an hsp <dig>  with high similarity to human hsc <dig>  an uncoating atpase for clathrin coated vesicles, is upregulated in pcf  <cit> . since clathrin-mediated endocytosis is upregulated in bsf but lysosomal targeting upregulated in pcf, these data may indicate a role in lysosomal targeting, but there are multiple hsp <dig> orfs in t. brucei and hsp <dig> has been previously reported to be upregulated slightly in bsf  <cit> . two novel er lumenal proteins, tb <dig> . <dig> and tb <dig> . <dig>  with a predicted signal peptide and c-terminal hdel er-retrieval motif are developmentally regulated, the former with augmented expression in bsf and the latter in pcf. both are localised to the er, and give a severe growth phenotype by rnai knockdown, suggesting an important function within the er . overall, the expression profile of the chaperones does not provide evidence for substantial differential remodelling of the er folding environment, and may suggest a comparatively similar set of factors are required for synthesis of the cell surface in pcf and bsf, despite major differences in the structures of the superabundant surface antigens.

lipid kinases
two highly conserved lipid kinases with roles in intracellular trafficking are known in trypanosomes: fab <dig> , a pi 5-kinase and tbvps <dig> , a pi 3-kinase involved in endocytosis and golgi segregation  <cit> . neither of these factors shows evidence for differential expression, but several other predicted phosphatidylinositol kinases are developmentally regulated . a type iii phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, tb <dig> . <dig>  highly similar to s. cerevisiae stt4p, is upregulated in pcf, consistent with a recent report of a role for a type iii pi 4-kinase in protein trafficking, maintenance of golgi and cell morphology and cytokinesis in pcfs  <cit> . a predicted phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, tb <dig> k <dig> , is also upregulated in pcf and most likely represents an atypical protein kinase of the tor-related family  <cit> . significantly, human frap <dig>  a member of the tor-related kinase family, is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . tb <dig> . <dig>  an atypical pi 3-kinase with a pip-binding fyve domain and a putative n-terminal trans-membrane helix is highly upregulated in bsf; on account of the fyve domain this protein is expected to localise to the endosomal system  <cit> . further, tb <dig> . <dig>  a predicted pi4p 5-kinase, is also upregulated in bsf, while two serine threonine kinases with pleckstrin homology  domains, capable of recognising pi <dig> p lipids, are upregulated in bsf. taken together these data suggest significant remodelling of the pi-based signalling system between life stages, together with evidence for increased expression of several putative endosomal functioning pi-kinases in the bsf.

protein kinases
a genome-wide analysis of the roles of kinases in clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis was performed recently in h. sapiens  <cit> ; significantly, caveolin-mediated endocytosis is restricted to the metazoa  <cit> . we looked for orthologues of the kinases that gave an endocytosis phenotype in the pelkmans et al . study  <cit>  and included these in the array to analyse their differential expression.

two metabolic pathway kinases and three putative signalling kinases are upregulated in bsf. these include tb <dig> . <dig>  a glycosomal hexokinase, expected due to increased glycolytic activity in bsfs  <cit> ; this kinase is similar to h. sapiens hexokinase ii, required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . pyruvate kinase  is also upregulated, in agreement with earlier work  <cit> , and interestingly the related h. sapiens kinase, pklr, inhibits caveolae-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . the three signalling kinases upregulated in bsf all show similarities to endocytosis kinases  <cit> . tb <dig> . <dig>  a putative map-kinase similar to human mapk <dig>  is activated in response to temperature stress  <cit> . a map-kinase kinase kinase, tb <dig> . <dig>  has similarity to human map3k <dig>  and finally a calcium-dependent protein kinase, tb <dig> . <dig>  is highly similar to camk <dig>  which participates in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase cascade  <cit> . these data clearly suggest a role for kinase activity in bsf trafficking.

eight primarily metabolic pathway kinases are upregulated in pcf. one is a nucleoside diphosphate kinase  which is involved in the equilibration of cellular pools of nucleotide triphosphates, and which binds telomeres and acts as a rho-gap in other systems  <cit> . this protein localises predominantly to the nucleus in t. brucei  <cit>  and shows similarity to human nme <dig>  found to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . a ribokinase  upregulated in pcf is highly similar to human rbsk, required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . a putative nek kinase  is related to human nek <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  all of which are required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> , and a putative utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase  <dig>  is related to human ugp <dig>  required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . a glycosomal glycerol kinase  related to human carkl, which is required for caveolin/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis  <cit> , was upregulated in pcf, although equivalent levels of specific activity for this enzyme have been reported for both life stages  <cit> . an arginine kinase  involved in the management of cellular atp energy reserves  <cit>  is similar to human ckb, required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . a putative dephospho-coa kinase  which catalyzes the final step in coa biosynthesis, is related to human dpck, which is required for caveolin/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . a phosphoglycerate kinase , similar to human pgk <dig>  which is involved in both clathrin-mediated and caveolin/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis  <cit>  was up in pcf, consistent with previous analyses for t. brucei pgkb  <cit> , although the oligonucleotide used does not allow us to differentiate pgk isoforms. a putative ser/thr and tyr dual specificity phosphatase  possibly involved in map kinase signalling, is also upregulated in pcf. taken together these data suggest multiple kinases are involved in control of trafficking in both life stages, with more signalling kinases upregulated in bsf, and these data provide a number of candidates for further analysis.

ubiquitylation
covalent attachment of ubiquitin to surface molecules is an important mechanism for internalization and lysosomal targeting  <cit> , and is present in trypanosomes  <cit> . five orfs likely to participate in the trypanosome ubiquitylation system are upregulated in bsf; tb <dig> . <dig>  an ubiquitin-activating e <dig> enzyme, tb <dig> . <dig>  an ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzyme, tb <dig> . <dig>  an ubiqutin ligase e <dig>  tb <dig> . <dig>  an ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase similar to s. cerevisiae doa4p protein, and tb <dig> . <dig>  which contains two putative ubiquitin interaction motifs, but otherwise has no predicted function. upregulation of a near complete pathway for protein ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation in bsfs is suggestive of stage-specific ubiquitylation, but clearly direct evidence is required  <cit> . rnai of the e <dig> tb <dig> . <dig> shows a strong growth defect but does not affect the stability of isg <dig>  a surface protein subject to ubiquitylation  <cit> . a protein containing a vhs domain  which is normally found in the vps <dig> component of escrt  <dig>  and a putative vps <dig> component of the escrt iii-associated complex  are upregulated in procyclics, further supporting differential regulation of the ubiquitin sorting system.

hypothetical open reading frames
a considerable fraction of the analysed orfs are annotated as hypothetical, and were included on account of sequence features shared with characterized trafficking factors. several of these exhibit developmental regulation. for example, the c <dig> domain is a ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting module  <cit> ; two orfs with predicted c <dig> domains, tb <dig> . <dig> and tb <dig> . <dig>  are upregulated in procyclics, and one, tb <dig> . <dig>  is upregulated in bsf. interestingly, tb <dig> . <dig> localises between the inner face of the plasma membrane and the sub-pellicular corset of microtubules in t. brucei, and includes a highly charged region characteristic of a tubulin-binding domain  <cit> . rnai evidence indicates a clear role for tb <dig> . <dig> in cytoskeletal function  <cit> .

other hypothetical genes that show significant differential regulation at the mrna level are, in pcf: tb <dig> . <dig>  which contains part of a sec <dig> domain , and tb <dig> . <dig>  which contains a signal peptide and a trans-membrane helix; both orfs are highly conserved between trypanosomatids but have no identifiable orthologues in other organisms. in bsf: tb <dig> . <dig>  which contains a cysteine-rich repeat region found in the low-density lipoprotein  receptor, and tb <dig> . <dig>  an extended coiled-coil protein are upregulated. the flagellum adhesion glycoprotein fla <dig> was upregulated in pcf, as has been reported previously  <cit> , but the closely related fla <dig>  <cit>  was upregulated in bsf, indicating that the two gene products may have similar functions but distinct expression patterns.

surface antigens
messages for bsf-specific esag6/ <dig> and isg65/ <dig> surface antigens are highly abundant . by contrast, cram, a possible lipoprotein receptor abundant in pcf, and barp, a putative glycolipid-lipid raft associated protein are not so highly expressed . interestingly, some of the oligonucleotides for barp showed upregulation in pcf and some in bsf ; bsf-specific and epimastigote-specific barp expression have been reported previously  <cit> . the differential expression levels for the isg <dig> mrnas  represent mostly the degeneracy of each oligonucleotide , but the mrnas for the isg <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>  are clearly more abundant than those for the isg <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> . we also included oligonucleotides for several isg-like proteins, four of which, tb <dig> . <dig>  tb <dig> . <dig>  tb <dig> . <dig>  and tb <dig> . <dig>  are significantly upregulated in bsf, suggesting additional and so far uncharacterised developmental modification of the parasite surface.

influence of stress and growth conditions on the transcriptome
the detection of a significant cohort of developmentally regulated trypanosome mrnas by microarray, and their validation by qrt-pcr, provided confidence that our procedure could be exploited for investigation of transcriptome changes associated with differing conditions. in several model organisms, the interactions between gene products has been probed by analysis of coordinated changes to the transcriptome in response to challenges to the cell. such studies have included several changes to growth conditions, insult with specific chemicals to invoke the unfolded protein response , and targeted manipulations of gene expression  <cit> . here we used all three approaches to probe the t. brucei transcriptome in order to determine the level of flexibility, and to assess if such data could facilitate construction of interaction and pathway maps based on coordinate expression profiles.

iron starvation
bloodstream trypanosomes are sensitive to iron starvation, and upregulate esag6/ <dig> transferrin receptor  mrna and protein levels when placed in low transferrin or iron-depleted media  <cit>  and adjust tfr expression to compensate for reduced endocytosis  <cit> . both observations suggest a specific transcriptional-level response resulting from an iron-sensing mechanism. the transcriptomes of bsfs cultured in different proportions of fetal bovine serum , in the absence of fbs or in the absence of fbs but supplemented with bovine holo-transferrin were analysed. an increase in esag6/ <dig> mrna was detected under fbs depletion by the array , which was validated by qrt-pcr in agreement with previous analyses  <cit> . mrnas for procyclin, the gp <dig> isoform tbmsp-c  and the major cysteine peptidase  were upregulated in serum-depleted cells . in cells grown in 30% fbs, procyclin mrna, as well as an isg-like protein  and a putative calcium-dependent protein kinase  were downregulated , which contrasts with a moderate upregulation of procyclin in serum free conditions. these alterations were confirmed by qrt-pcr, and may suggest a suppression of procyclin expression by serum factors. however, overall there were no additional transcriptome changes when cells were grown in 30% fbs or in 0% fbs with or without transferrin. scatter plots of the entire array data set indicate few transcripts that fall outside of the region considered as equivalent, in marked contrast to the scattergram obtained for developmental changes . these data suggest a very limited and specific ability of the bsf to respond to alterations in levels of nutrients, which may be restricted primarily to esag6/ <dig> 

the most significantly altered mrnas detected by microarray for differing serum conditions, dithiothreitol and tunicamycin treatment, rnai of vsg or clh, and rab <dig> overexpressing pcf lines are shown. the ratios obtained by qrt-pcr for selected transcripts are also shown. ratios are given on a linear  scale, and those indicating a reduction compared to the control state are in parentheses. only orfs that display at least a two-fold change, by either qrt-pcr or array, are included; except the  <dig> hour dtt treatment, where only the top ten hits are shown. ratios which correspond to a value > <dig> for the b-statistic in limma analysis are shown in bold.

unfolded protein response 
transcriptome responsiveness was further tested by attempts to invoke the upr, a classic er-based pathway stimulated by the presence of increased levels of unfolded polypeptides  <cit> . the upr is mediated via transcriptional responses in both yeast and metazoan cells  <cit> , and can be reliably activated by addition of tunicamycin or dithiothreitol . using tunicamycin and dtt at concentrations that invoke a upr in mammalian cells, arabidopsis, yeast and other systems  <cit> , we found that, in t. brucei, tunicamycin resulted in growth arrest over a period of up to  <dig> hours, while dtt exposure led to rapid cell death . this concentration of tunicamycin also efficiently inhibits trypanosome n-glycosylation  <cit> . therefore, we analysed the transcriptome at  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> mm for tunicamycin and dtt, respectively, under conditions where cells remained viable, as assessed by motility.

essentially no significant change to the transcriptome was observed by either treatment. very few orfs showed significant differential regulation under dtt or tunicamycin treatment, and scatterplots indicate few transcripts falling outside of the equivalence region, in marked contrast to developmental changes . only one hypothetical chaperone was upregulated after  <dig> hr in  <dig> mm dtt, while rab <dig>  esag <dig>  and an isg-like protein  were downregulated. by contrast, a pdi class orf, tb <dig> k <dig> , was downregulated after  <dig> hr of tunicamycin treatment, while esag6/ <dig> as well as procyclin were upregulated in cells treated with tunicamycin . further, total cell lysates were examined for increased expression of the major er chaperone, bip, by western blotting and qrt-pcr. no alteration in expression of this marker, which is rapidly and strongly induced by the upr in higher eukaryotes, was observed following dtt or tunicamycin exposure . these data indicate an essential lack of transcriptome responsiveness to altered conditions by the trypanosome, and specifically the complete absence of a classical upr. significantly, this likely contributes to the extreme sensitivity of trypanosomes to dtt.

knockdown of clathrin and vsg
as an additional strategy for investigating transcriptome responsiveness, the mrnas of two highly important proteins involved in endocytosis and surface architecture, specifically the clathrin heavy chain  and vsg, were suppressed with rnai. both proteins are essential and clh rnai results in rapid cell death. for clh, knockdown leads to a complete block to endocytosis  <cit> , while vsg rnai results in arrest of cell cycle progression  <cit> . we hypothesized that if trypanosomes were able to sense alterations in trafficking and respond to these changes, then depletion of these two orfs by rnai would be expected to elicit a response.

we analysed the transcriptome of cells  <dig> hours after induction of the clh rnai, as the clh protein levels are significantly reduced at that stage , growth is arrested, and the big eye morphology is clearly visible . despite a clear phenotype, we observed very limited transcriptome changes . only tbmsp-c and an isg-like orf  were significantly upregulated, while only a putative rab effector, gmp-pdeδ  and a putative cbl-interacting protein kinase  were significantly downregulated . for the vsg rnai, we analysed cells  <dig> and  <dig> hours after induction to examine both early and late effects of vsg depletion. no major transcriptome changes were observed  despite growth arrest . indeed, only one orf, a putative rabgef  was significantly upregulated . the absence of a coordinated response within the transcriptome as a result of these severe perturbations of cellular homeostasis suggests that trypanosomes lack mechanisms for response at the mrna level to altered circumstances.

the transcriptome is unaltered in cells with augmented endocytic activity
as a final test of transcriptome responsiveness we analysed the effects of over-expression of the early endosome small gtpases rab5a and rab5b in pcf, which results in significant augmentation of fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytic activity  <cit> . the expression level of clh was increased, providing a mechanistic explanation for augmented endocytic activity . these data extend earlier work showing loss of clh protein following rab5a or 5b knockdown in bsf  <cit> , and demonstrating coordinated expression of clathrin and rab <dig> 

very limited differential expression was seen between rab <dig> over-expressing and control cells . analysis by array, qrt-pcr and western blot confirmed that the cell lines were overexpressing rab5a or rab5b but only detected significant upregulation for rabx <dig>  adenylate kinase  <dig> , and copiε mrnas in the rab5awt, rab5aql and rab5bql overexpressor lines , none of which are expected as specific changes related to early endosome activity. further, several mrnas implicated as altered by array analysis failed to be validated by qrt-pcr, suggesting small or insignificant changes only . importantly, we were unable to detect a significant increase in clh mrna in any of the cell lines by qrt-pcr, despite significant protein level changes . these data suggest, firstly, that alteration of clh levels in these cells proceeds via exclusively post-transcriptional mechanisms and, secondly, that despite clear perturbation to endocytic activity, this is not reflected in an obvious or coherent alteration to the underlying transcriptome.

significant transcriptome alterations between in vivo and in vitro cultured trypanosomes
the vast majority of molecular studies on t. brucei are carried out using in vitro cultures. recently, whole-genome microarray analysis indicated significant differences between in vivo and in vitro cultures of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum  <cit> . therefore, as an additional investigation into the influence of culturing conditions on intracellular transport we compared mrna from bloodstream form mitat <dig>  trypanosomes extracted from infected rats and from smb cells cultured under standard conditions. a significant number of differentially abundant mrnas are evident from the scattergram of these arrays , and limma analysis indicated that  <dig> orfs are significantly upregulated in the in vitro culture, while three orfs are significantly downregulated . these include orfs for an rna helicase, procyclin, cap <dig> , several small gtpases and their effectors and several kinases . this expression pattern did not reveal an obvious functional pattern, in the sense that orfs from many biological systems appeared affected. to eliminate the possibility that these alterations arise from cold-shock during isolation of mitat <dig>  trypomastigotes, we also extracted rna from smb cultures incubated at 4°c for  <dig> hr. we observed very few changes between normal and cold-shocked smb cultures , with only cap <dig>  and a sec34-like orf significantly upregulated in the cold treatment, both of which are procyclic markers. given the rapidity of isolation of the mrna from mitat <dig> , which is achieved in less than one hour, and their incubation at 4°c during the procedure, which is expected to reduce metabolic activity, we consider these findings to be unlikely ascribable to factors associated with preparation of the samples as the differences in several mrna levels are too great to have accumulated in such a short period. therefore, these data highlight significant differences between in vivo and in vitro cultured trypanosomes; this issue would be best pursued by whole genome microarray analysis which is beyond the scope of the present study.

discussion
coordinate control of gene expression is critical for life cycle progression in trypanosomes, and extensive remodeling of the parasite cell is well documented. here we used the intracellular trafficking system as a model for transcriptome changes. we selected this process on account of well documented alterations to endocytosis accompanying developmental progression, a good level of characterization in trypanosomes, together with, by analogy to higher eukaryotes, the expectation that many gene products will collaborate in regulation. endomembrane transport involves ~10% of the protein coding potential within the eukaryotic genome  <cit>  and position and time-dependent targeting, assembly of macromolecular complexes and cytoskeletal interactions all participate in controlling a system demanding high fidelity in delivery of molecules to specific subcellular destinations. further, in higher eukaryotes, transcriptional flexibility and coordination are associated with intracellular transport  <cit> . due to the polycistronic mode of transcription in trypanosomes, changes in relative levels of mrnas result primarily from alterations in the efficiency of nascent rna processing or half-life  <cit> . here we detected clear evidence for developmental alterations to the trypanosome transcriptome, but found very little flexibility within a given life stage.

firstly, ~6% of transport-associated transcripts are developmentally regulated, a greater fraction than reported for genome-wide transcription  <cit> . these data indicate that developmental remodeling of endomembrane transport is underpinned by alterations to mrna abundance, as expected. we also observed prominent differential expression of transport-associated mrnas between trypanosomes cultured in vitro and those isolated from a mammalian host. a greater proportion of mrnas were upregulated in the bloodstream stage compared to the insect form, correlating with increased endocytic activity. prominent upregulated factors include rab gtpases and snares; significantly, simple upregulation of rab and/or snare proteins is sufficient to augment specific transport pathways  <cit> . while the cohort of upregulated mammalian stage mrnas is consistent with increased endocytic activity, there is evidence that the rab5/rab <dig> vsg endocytosis and recycling system  <cit>  is only part of the developmental change. for pcfs, the upregulated cohort is consistent with lysosomal degradative pathways playing a more prominent role  <cit> . direct examination of several of the gene products implicated here is clearly required for a more detailed understanding of trypanosome differentiation.

secondly, and in clear contrast, extremely limited changes to mrna levels were encountered in response to a wide variety of altered states, including major changes to culturing conditions, insult with agents disrupting protein folding and rnai of critical mrnas encoding factors essential for endocytosis and cell surface maintenance. despite polycistronic transcription, a priori there is no compelling reason to assume that turnover of mrna is uncoupled from signaling systems and, moreover, the observation that iron-deficiency leads to increased expression of the esag6/ <dig> transferrin receptor mrnas and protein provides a potential example of signal-mediated changes to mrna abundance   <cit> . analysis of a large gene cohort indicates that the transferrin receptor is a special case, and we were unable to find compelling evidence for alterations to levels of most mrnas. the transferrin receptor genes are located in an rna pol i-transcribed subtelomeric array  <cit>  and thus may be regulated differentially from most genes that are transcribed by rna pol ii  <cit> . we also observed mrna level alterations in a further pol i-derived transcript, procyclin, in response to several challenges, but we note that procyclin expression is unusually sensitive to many factors . regardless of these exceptions, our data indicate that the vast majority of trypanosome mrnas are unmodulated, suggesting that, for most messages, transcription and turnover are unaffected by signaling pathways. this implies that the trypanosome has a very limited capacity to respond to altered circumstances in vivo, except via pre-programmed differentiation pathways.

the absence of transcriptome responsiveness to environmental cues has several consequences. firstly, lack of a classical upr indicates er insensitivity to increased concentrations of non-native polypeptides, and implies that changes in biosynthetic output similarly will not be sensed. this is consistent with extreme sensitivity to concentrations of dtt that are well tolerated in higher eukaryotes. whether the upr is absent from additional excavates is unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that giardia also lacks the pathway  <cit> . secondly, failure to modify the transcriptome following gene knockdown or over-expression, but where a major impact on transport is found, suggests that modulation of trafficking, and potentially other systems, within a given life stage is restricted to proteomic changes  <cit> . thirdly, and most significantly, the data indicate an inability of the trypanosome endomembrane system to adapt to altering conditions and, coupled with the possibility that such unresponsiveness extends to additional cellular functions, has profound implications.

limited transcriptional flexibility is clearly a restriction for the trypanosome, but is in agreement with a modest small gtpase signaling network  <cit> , which may indicate a rather limited signal transduction capacity. as each life stage exists within a highly controlled environment the trypanosome's ability to modulate the trafficking system has likely been lost. the environment within the insect host is poorly understood, but the bloodstream ph range in h. sapiens is  <dig>  –  <dig> , blood glucose is at  <dig> –  <dig> mm and transferrin concentration is maintained at ~ <dig> ±  <dig> μg/dl  <cit> ; major alterations to these parameters are lethal, and hence there is little need for the parasite to retain mechanisms for responsiveness. by contrast, a new transcriptome would be triggered by appropriate signals when the trypanosome enters a new compartment or host. hence the trypanosome life cycle may be viewed as a set of inflexible, sequential transcriptional profiles that serve to adapt the parasite to each new environment . the in vitro cultured bsf is a convenient model for the mammalian bloodstream trypomastigote but, during infection, trypanosomes also invade tissue spaces, the lymphatic system and, in later disease stages, the cerebral spinal fluid  <cit> . each environment differs greatly from the bloodstream in composition and hence transcriptome inflexibility suggests that a differentiation event may be required for adaptation. further, the major transcriptome differences between cultured and animal-isolated trypanosomes underscores the potential for currently uncharted, but dramatic, adaptations associated with mammalian infection.

a similar transcriptional rigidity is suggested for the intra-erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, possibly also related to the fact that plasmodium enjoys a homeostatic host environment  <cit> . trypanosomatids  and plasmodia  are highly divergent and separated by many non-parasitic or free-living species, and thus transcriptome unresponsiveness most likely is the result of independent secondary loss accompanying adoption of the parasitic life style. consistent with this view, environmental stress treatments do induce transcriptional responses in euglena gracilis  <cit> , a free-living protist closely related to kinetoplastids. further, as plasmodium utilises a more conventional promoter-mediated mechanism for transcription, this also rules out a trivial explanation that transcriptome inflexibility is simply the result of polycistronic transcription. examination of transcriptome regulation in more free-living organisms related to both plasmodium and trypanosomes would be highly informative.

finally, these data indicate that knockdown of a specific mrna does not alter the transcript levels of additional gene products coordinated functionally with the rnai target. therefore, in t. brucei rnai is unlikely to suffer from off target effects as seen in higher eukaryotes  <cit> , and hence is, in this regard, unusually clean. secondary effects are likely mediated via proteome changes, and could explain the similar phenotypes observed for many knockdowns  <cit> . this is particularly prominent for cell cycle/cytokinesis defects that frequently emerge rather late following knockdown. such effects may be the result of generic loss of the normal proteome, rather than absence of specific factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the life cycle of t. brucei includes a dramatic differentiation event as the parasite progresses from the insect to the mammalian host. differentiation encompasses considerable remodeling of the membrane trafficking system, which is also a vital component of the host-parasite interface. using a subgenome microarray targeting the t. brucei trafficking systems together with qrt-pcr analysis, we find clear evidence for developmental alteration to ~6% of the trypanosome transport-associated transcriptome. this indicates that developmental remodeling of endomembrane transport is underpinned by alterations to mrna abundance, and that such changes may be analysed by microarray. most protein-coding mrnas in trypanosomatids are produced by polycistronic transcription, with specific rates of decay as the major mechanism controlling steady state transcript levels. multiple stimuli, including major changes to culturing conditions, insult with agents disrupting protein folding, and rnai of critical mrnas encoding factors essential for endocytosis and cell surface maintenance, elicited extremely limited changes to the transcriptome. besides alterations in expression of the transferrin receptor upon iron stress, which is transcribed by pol i, the vast majority of trypanosome chromosomal pol ii-derived mrnas are unmodulated. these findings imply a very limited capacity of trypanosomes to respond to altered circumstances in vivo, except via pre-determined differentiation pathways . hence mrna levels are insensitive to external stimuli and most responses are mediated at the proteome level. these data suggest a new view of the trypanosome life cycle as a progression through sequential, inflexible transcriptional profiles that serve to adapt the parasite to each new host environment. as similar transcriptional rigidity is suggested for the malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, but transcriptional flexibility is found in the closely related and free-living protist, euglena gracilis, it is likely that loss of transcriptional flexibility arose through the parasitic lifestyle.
