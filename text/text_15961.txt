BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative coccobacillus frequently associated with nosocomial infections worldwide  <cit> . it is an opportunistic pathogen with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including pneumonia, meningitis, and blood stream, urinary tract, and wound infections  <cit> . a. baumannii has developed resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics and has thus become problematic in intensive care units   <cit> . in taiwan, the first multidrug-resistant a. baumannii  strain was identified in  <dig>  <cit> . this strain was among the top three pathogens causing nosocomial infections in icus in taiwan from 2003– <dig>  <cit> , and the incidence of mdrab infections worldwide has continued to increase  <cit> .

nosocomial mdrab infections are usually transmitted between patients by contaminated health-care personnel  <cit> . therefore, there is growing interest in controlling the spread of mdrab caused by health-care workers, contaminated equipment, and icu environments through disinfection methods. to date, several disinfection techniques have been evaluated for inactivating a. baumannii, including pasteurization  <cit> , ultraviolet light  <cit> , chemical sanitizers  <cit> , ozone  <cit> , and photocatalysis  <cit> . these sterilization techniques are highly effective in reducing a. baumannii contamination, but may be harmful to humans or surface materials in the icu environment. moreover, extensive use of chemicals can cause bacteria to develop resistance to chemical sanitizers  <cit> . for example, the growth and virulence of mdrab are enhanced following exposure to ethanol and alcohol-based hand rubs  <cit> . thus, there is an immediate need to develop alternative strategies for preventing the spread of mdrab.

bacteriophages  are natural parasites of bacteria and are extremely host-specific. therefore, the use of phages to reduce the concentration of specific bacterial foodborne pathogens has gained increasing attention  <cit> . for example, phages have been used to treat foods contaminated with strains of campylobacter <cit> , enterobacter <cit> , escherichia coli o <dig>  <cit> , listeria <cit> , salmonella <cit> , and staphylococcus <cit> . the levels of these bacterial pathogens have been successfully reduced by 1– <dig> logs, depending upon the method used. moreover, the united states food and drug administration has already approved the use of a listeria-specific phage, listex p <dig>  for food preservation  <cit> . although these studies suggest that bacteriophages might be highly effective in reducing mdrab levels, this has not been studied in detail.

although phages can significantly reduce the amount of pathogenic bacteria in liquid foods  <cit> , the use of phages to reduce the levels of bacteria on hard surfaces has rarely been studied. culture-positive swab samples of mdrab have been recovered from frequently touched surfaces in icus  <cit> . these observations indicate the possible role of environmental surfaces in the spread of mdrab  <cit> . liquid suspensions containing a high concentration of phages allow the free diffusion of phages to ensure contact with their specific host  <cit> . however, for hard surfaces, an uneven and large surface area may limit the distribution of phage particles and decrease their ability to reach their bacterial targets  <cit> . this is especially true for low concentrations of bacteria that are unevenly distributed in the environment  <cit> . therefore, the effects of phage concentration, host cell concentration and incubation time  on the degree of biocontrol on hard surfaces should be further investigated.

despite intensive programs to encourage hand washing by health-care personnel, there is still a high rate of mdrab transmission in icus. o’flaherty  <cit>  demonstrated the inclusion of phage k in an oil-based cream killed staphylococcus aureus on agar and in broth cultures. thus, a phage-containing hand cream could reduce pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . however, that study did not report on the stability of phages in the cream or on the exact degree of the bactericidal effect achieved. if a phage-containing cream were feasible for infection control, this approach would likely reduce the transmission of mdrab from the hands of health-care personnel to patients in icus.

the first lytic phage shown to specifically infect mdrab was characterized in  <dig>  <cit>  and belonged to the podoviridae family, with a broad host range amongst mdrab strains. this is the only known phage capable of infecting a. baumannii atcc <dig>  whose genome has been fully sequenced  <cit> . in addition, ϕab <dig> can rapidly adsorb to its host and has a large burst size  <cit> . these advantages make ϕab <dig> a good model phage for controlling the prevalence of nosocomial infections caused by mdrab. to our knowledge, most biocontrol studies have focused on using phages as food decontaminants  <cit> . the application of a phage as a disinfectant agent for the control of mdrab has not been previously reported. consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the ability of ϕab <dig> phage to reduce mdrab in suspension and on experimentally-contaminated glass surfaces. in addition, the ability of ϕab <dig> in a paraffin oil-based lotion or glycerol to reduce the number of viable mdrab was determined. the stability of ϕab <dig> under different environments  was also evaluated.

RESULTS
adsorption and one-step growth curve of ϕab2
ϕab <dig> rapidly was adsorbed onto both a. baumannii m <dig> and a. baumannii atcc  <dig> . within  <dig> min, greater than 95% of the phage particles were adsorbed to a. baumannii m <dig> and a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  and nearly 100% were adsorbed by  <dig> min.

effect of temperature on ϕab <dig> stability
figure 2a shows the stability of ϕab <dig> stored in deionized water at −20°c, 4°c, and 25°c, over  <dig> days. when the phages were stored in deionized water at −20°c, 25°c, and 4°c for  <dig> days they retained  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of infectivity, respectively. although ϕab <dig> had infectivity retention of more than 50% when stored in deionized water after  <dig> days at 4°c, infectivity retention of more than 50% was only observed up to  <dig> days in samples stored at −20°c or 25°c. the effect of refreezing on phage survival demonstrated that ϕab <dig> was unstable when the sample was frozen repeatedly, as greater than  <dig> % of phages lost infectivity after refreezing during a 360-day storage period at −20°c.

effect of ph on ϕab <dig> stability
the optimal ph for ϕab <dig> stability was determined . ϕab <dig> was relatively stable following 360-day incubation at ph  <dig>  under these conditions, there was a 2-log decrease in ϕab <dig> phage titers from the initial titer of  <dig> pfu/ml. however, ϕab <dig> titers decreased by over 5-logs after 180-day incubation at ph  <dig> or ph  <dig>  in extremely acidic conditions, at ph  <dig>  no ϕab <dig> plaques were identified after  <dig> min . thus, ϕab <dig> is unstable under extreme ph conditions.

effect of chloroform concentration on ϕab <dig> stability
ϕab <dig> titers were reduced following exposure to chloroform concentrations of  <dig> % and 2% . for phage purification, a chloroform concentration of  <dig> –2%  is typically used, thus the infectivity of ϕab <dig> following exposure to  <dig> % and 2% chloroform was investigated. ϕab <dig> exposed to  <dig> % chloroform retained stable infectivity of greater than 20% following a 360-day storage period. however, infectivity retention of ϕab <dig> was only 5% following a 360-day storage period in 2% chloroform .

ϕab <dig> stability on glass slides
desiccation reduced the stability of ϕab <dig> when spiked onto a glass surface over a 65-day period . there was a 1-log decrease in ϕab <dig> titers  after  <dig> h on the glass surface. infectivity of ϕab <dig> on a glass slide was  <dig> % after  <dig> days and  <dig> % after  <dig> days. thus, ϕab <dig> could survive on a dried glass surface for  <dig> months, although a large reduction in ϕab <dig> titers was observed.

reduction of mdrab by ϕab <dig> in a liquid suspension
we next assessed the ability of ϕab <dig> to reduce the concentration of a. baumannii m <dig> in sterile water over different incubation times . the addition of ϕab <dig> to a liquid suspension of a. baumannii m <dig> had a strong bactericidal effect in all test groups except the  <dig> min incubation low dose group  . the ϕab <dig> bactericidal effect showed a dose-response as the lowest concentration of ϕab <dig> tested  exhibited the weakest bactericidal capability, which was  <dig> -fold lower than when higher phage concentrations  were used . the addition of  <dig> or  <dig> pfu/ml ϕab <dig> reduced the number of a. baumannii m <dig> by at least 3-logs at all bacterial test concentrations after  <dig> min. after  <dig> min incubation, the effect was even greater, with at least a 4-log reduction in mdrab survival rates . in addition, the mean reduction in bacteria was greater when a higher initial bacterial concentration was used. thus, the same concentration of ϕab <dig> had a stronger bactericidal effect when added to high bacterial concentrations  compared with low bacterial concentrations . all control groups showed a 100% survival rate. in addition to the phage and bacterial host concentrations, the incubation time was also important for the bactericidal effect. approximately 95% of phage particles adsorbed to host cells within  <dig> min, and nearly 100% were adsorbed by  <dig> min . therefore, we selected the  <dig> and  <dig> min time points to test the bactericidal effect of ϕab <dig> in suspension. at a low phage concentration , an increase in the incubation time from  <dig> to  <dig> min resulted in a mean decrease of survival rate of mdrab between  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold. in contrast, at higher phage concentrations  there was a mean reduction of bacterial concentration of  <dig> - to 7-fold when the incubation time was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> min.

bactericidal effect of ϕab <dig> on a hard surface
the addition of ϕab <dig> to a hard glass surface contaminated with a. baumannii m <dig> had a bactericidal effect under some conditions . phage concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> pfu/slide caused a significant reduction  of a. baumannii m <dig> cells  after  <dig> min . when a phage concentration of  <dig> pfu/slide was used, the number of a. baumannii m <dig> was significantly reduced  after  <dig> or  <dig> min for all concentrations of bacteria tested . however, the bactericidal effect of ϕab <dig> at  <dig> pfu/slide was significantly lower for a. baumannii m <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> cfu/slide than at  <dig> cfu/slide . to date, there is no standard method for evaluating phage biocontrol efficiency on a hard surface. incubation times of  <dig> and  <dig> min were chosen for surface tests on the basis of ϕab <dig> adsorption data  and a previous study by abuladze et al.  <cit> . extending the incubation time from  <dig> to  <dig> min increased the mean bactericidal effect on a. baumannii m <dig>  <dig> -fold under all test conditions.

use of ϕab <dig> as a hand sanitizer in a paraffin oil-based lotion
the stability of ϕab <dig> in a lotion and its ability to kill a. baumannii m <dig> when spread on agar , were evaluated to determine the potential of ϕab <dig> as a hand lotion antiseptic. prior to the addition of the phage lotion, lysogeny broth  agar was pre-contaminated with approximately 5 ×  <dig>  5 ×  <dig>  or 5 ×  <dig> cfu/ml  =  <dig> %) of a. baumannii m <dig> . the initial phage concentration in the lotion was  <dig> pfu/ml; however, this concentration decreased by approximately 98% after  <dig> days of storage . phage lotion stored for  <dig> day significantly reduced  viable a. baumannii m <dig> at initial concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cfu/ml on agar, by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. lotion stored for  <dig> days also significantly reduced  the concentration of viable a. baumannii m <dig> by 92%, 88%, and 90%, respectively. lotion stored for longer than  <dig> days could not effectively reduce the a. baumannii m <dig> concentration. spreading a larger volume  of lotion on agar did not significantly alter the number of a. baumannii m <dig> killed by the phage, as compared with a smaller volume .

use of ϕab <dig> as a hand sanitizer in glycerol
glycerol is used by the cosmetics industry to retain moisture in the skin. therefore, the addition of ϕab <dig> to glycerol may be an effective way to formulate a hand sanitizer that can decrease mdrab contamination and retain moisture within the skin. because the amount of glycerol in cosmetic products varies , a concentration of 10%  glycerol was evaluated in this study. prior to the addition of the phage-containing glycerol, lb agar was pre-contaminated with approximately 5 ×  <dig>  5 ×  <dig>  or 5 ×  <dig> cfu/ml  of a. baumannii m <dig> . the ϕab <dig> phage concentration  did not significantly decrease  when added to a glycerol solution and stored for  <dig> days. the application of phage-containing glycerol stored for  <dig> days to inoculated agar significantly reduced  the mean concentration of viable a. baumannii m <dig> by  <dig> %, regardless of the initial bacterial concentration. after  <dig> days of storage, ϕab <dig> titers were decreased by approximately 2-logs . the application of phage-containing glycerol stored for  <dig> days reduced the mean concentration of viable a. baumannii m <dig> by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % when the initial concentration of a. baumannii m <dig> was  <dig> cfu/ml,  <dig> cfu/ml, and  <dig> cfu/ml, respectively. similar to the effect observed with the lotion, the bactericidal effect of spreading a larger volume  of the phage-containing glycerol on agar was not significantly different from that of a smaller volume .

discussion
to date, most biocontrol studies have used phages for the decontamination of food and limited data are available concerning the stability of phages in an environmental matrix. furthermore, the use of a phage to prevent infections caused by mdrab has not been demonstrated. the ϕab <dig> phage was selected as a model phage for this study because its dna and protein profiles were previously determined  <cit> . the current study demonstrated that phages such as the ϕab <dig> phage might be useful for reducing mdrab contamination in liquid suspensions or on hard surfaces such as may be encountered in icus, and may be added to a solution to produce an antiseptic hand wash.

one issue with the human use of phages is their potential toxicity. previously, we demonstrated ϕab <dig> had 91–99% dna sequence identity with the fully sequenced ϕab <dig> and that to date, no putative or confirmed toxin genes have been identified in ϕab <dig>  <cit> . in addition, no prophage-related genes were observed in ϕab <dig>  although vallenet et al. suggested that putative prophage sequences account for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genomes of both a. baumannii strains  <cit> . thus, it is reasonable to assume that ϕab <dig> has no toxin genes or prophage-related genes, and we predict there will no safety issues related to toxin production or chromosomal integration of ϕab <dig> 

there have been limited studies regarding environmental effects on phage stability. a previous study investigated another a. baumannii-specific phage, ab <dig>  which is relatively heat resistant and can survive temperatures of 50–60°c, and even a 15-min incubation at 90°c  <cit> . the stability of ϕab <dig> at extremely high temperatures was not evaluated in the present study because ϕab <dig> is proposed for use as an alternative sanitizer, so information regarding its stability for long storage periods at refrigerated or freezing temperatures was more relevant. our study demonstrated that phage infectivity is strongly dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature, ph, and the presence of other organic substances. investigation of the optimal ph for maintaining ϕab <dig> infectivity demonstrated that the least damaging ph tested was ph  <dig>  similar to the sewage from which ϕab <dig> was isolated . yang et al. also demonstrated that the ab <dig> phage was most stable at ph  <dig>  and that less than  <dig> % of ab <dig> phages lost their infectivity in a range between ph 5– <dig>  <cit> . thus, our environmental stability results indicated that ϕab <dig> should be stored in a ph  <dig> solution at 4°c for extended storage if ϕab <dig> is incorporated into a detergent.

because mdrab survives for long periods on environmental surfaces and may promote cross-transmission, we investigated the efficiency of ϕab <dig> in reducing a. baumannii m <dig> contamination on surfaces. we observed the ϕab <dig> concentration required to reduce a. baumannii m <dig> contamination was lower for liquid suspensions than hard surfaces. the mean survival rate ratio of a. baumannii m <dig> between surface and liquid suspension ranged from 2– <dig>  depending on the phage concentration. as ϕab <dig> does not diffuse as freely on a hard surface as in a suspension, a higher concentration of ϕab <dig> was required for surface decontamination of mdrab compared with in solution.

the ability of phages to persist on a surface for extended periods is limited by many factors, such as desiccation  <cit> , which may explain the loss of ϕab <dig> infectivity after  <dig> months storage on a glass surface. because ϕab <dig> cannot survive for long periods on a hard surface, the phage detergent must be frequently re-applied to surfaces to provide persistent bactericidal or mdrab activity.

previous biocontrol studies suggested that high phage numbers should be used without relying on phage amplification  <cit> . although ϕab <dig> has a larger burst size than other phages  <cit> , it is important to determine the optimal phage concentration that will allow efficient phage attachment and amplification for the quantity of mdrab present. experiments on environmental icu samples have identified a. baumannii on 39% of the sampled surfaces with a mean a. baumannii dna concentration of  <dig>  copies  <cit> . based on the results of our surface evaluation, we recommend that a phage concentration of at least  <dig> pfu/cm <dig> be applied to surfaces in icus. this approach may not be suitable for the treatment of large surfaces, but may be useful for small biomedical devices. abuladze et al. suggested a glass matrix is easier to decontaminate than gypsum  <cit> . thus, the phage decontamination efficiency for different surfaces such as gypsum, plastic, teflon, or other polymers may vary, and requires further investigation. in addition to phage concentration, the incubation time is also critical for surface applications. when a high phage concentration  was used to treat a surface contaminated with bacteria at a concentration of  <dig> cfu/slide, an incubation time of  <dig> min resulted in a 96% reduction of a. baumannii m <dig> numbers. this incubation time was caused a 94% reduction in the number of escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  <cit>  under the same test conditions.

mdrab can be transmitted via the hands of health-care personnel. however, frequent or improper hand washing can cause skin to lose moisture or become irritated, reducing the hand washing rate despite intensive hand washing educational programs. therefore, the addition of paraffin oil and glycerol to the formulation of antiseptic hand wash might retain skin moisture and reduce the transmission of mdrab from the hands of health-care workers to patients. alcohol-based hand rubs could reduce skin irritation  <cit>  and reduce the number of bacteria more effectively than soap and water in a number of experimental models  <cit> . however, a. baumannii may metabolize low levels of alcohol to become more virulent  <cit> . thus, an alternative hand washing approach is required to prevent microorganisms becoming tolerant to alcohol-based disinfectants in the future.

in this study, we designed two antiseptic hand wash experiments and observed a difference in the bactericidal effect between phage-containing lotion and glycerol solution, possibly related to the stability of ϕab <dig> in different media. because the detailed compositions of commercial creams are proprietary, it is difficult to explain the unpredictable changes of phage numbers in the cream, as phages could aggregate, disaggregate, or decay after long storage periods. o’flaherty et al. demonstrated that s. aureus-specific phage k exhibited antibacterial activity when incorporated into a bismuth-based cream  <cit> . the bismuth cream exhibited well antibacterial activity, but the related phage stability was not reported. in contrast, we observed that ϕab <dig> was stable in 10% glycerol after  <dig> days storage at room temperature. glycerol is a common cryoprotectant for phage infectivity during storage at temperatures between − <dig> and −70°c. other phages, including f-specific rna bacteriophages, and bacteroides fragilis-specific phages, are also stable in 10% glycerol for up to  <dig> days  <cit>  and can retain their infectivity with even longer storage times.

CONCLUSIONS
since the introduction of antibiotics for clinical use, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as mdrab, have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. our study used ϕab <dig> as a model phage to demonstrate its potential for the prevention of nosocomial mdrab infections. as mdrab are resistant to almost all currently available antibiotics and sanitizers, phages represent an alternative environmental decontamination approach. although some studies have focused on isolating and characterizing new phages with a broader host range, further information regarding the stability of phages in different environments is required before these phages are used in hospitals. while phages could be used to decontaminate environmental surfaces naturally contaminated by mdrab, when bacterial cell numbers are low and the surface area is large, a high phage concentration  is required to ensure contact between phages and their hosts. this study demonstrated that high concentrations of phages might be inoculated into a lotion or glycerol and used as an antiseptic hand wash. however, the phage concentration and incubation time should be carefully determined to identify the optimal bactericidal effect on mdrab.
