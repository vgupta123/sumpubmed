BACKGROUND
genome sequencing of diverse bacterial species has revealed widespread distribution of conserved gene products with as-yet unknown functions. among these are a family of small proteins with approximate molecular masses of  <dig> kda, which have been variously classed as "domain of unknown function"   <dig>  pfam  <dig> and cog- <dig>  <cit> . such genes have been identified in a wide variety of bacterial phyla, a list that includes many significant pathogens of humans, domestic animals and plants .

after the genome sequence of h. influenzae strain kw <dig> rd  was determined in  <dig>  <cit> , the "structure  <dig> function project" was established to crystallize recombinant proteins from h. influenzae genes of unknown function http://s2f.umbi.umd.edu/. among these orphan gene products was the h. influenzae duf  <dig> group member annotated as open reading frame  hi <dig>  and tentatively named "ybab"  <cit> . h. influenzae ybab  crystallized as a homodimer, with the central portion forming  <dig> antiparallel β-strands, long α-helices at the amino- and carboxy-termini , and a short α-helix bridging the β-folded region and α-helix  <dig> . the two subunits of the homodimer interface at the β-strand region, α-helix  <dig> and the initial residues of α-helix  <dig>  while α-helix  <dig> and the terminal portion of α-helix  <dig> project away from the dimerization region. this distinctive structure that has been described as resembling a set of tweezers  <cit> . although the researchers who initially characterized ybabhi speculated that it may be a dna-binding protein, studies conducted at that time failed to detect binding to any of their analyzed dna probes  <cit> .

the escherichia coli chromosome carries an orthologous gene that has been referred to as "orf 12"   <cit> . recombinant e. coli ybab  has also been crystallized and information about its unpublished three-dimensional structure is available on-line http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureid=1pug. the determined structures of ybabec and ybabhi are nearly identical. a function for ybabec appears not to have been investigated prior to the current work.

the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi produces a protein named ebfc that shares 29% identical and 56% similar amino acids with ybabhi . our laboratories recently discovered that ebfc binds a specific dna sequence 5' of the spirochete's erp loci  <cit> . those results suggested that orthologous proteins may also be dna-binding proteins. we therefore re-examined the properties of ybabhi, and found that it does bind to certain dnas. ybabec was also demonstrated to be a dna-binding protein.

RESULTS
the abilities of ybabec and ybabhi to bind dna were first tested using a labeled dna probe corresponding to sequences surrounding b. burgdorferi erpab operator  <dig> . this dna was chosen because the b. burgdorferi ybab ortholog, ebfc, binds specifically to sequences within that region of dna  <cit> . both the e. coli and h. influenzae orthologs bound this dna probe, each forming multiple dna-protein complexes . the simplest interpretation of these data is that each ladder of gel bands represents a stoichiometric series with higher stoichiometry  products formed from lower stoichiometry  precursors as protein concentration is increased. similar patterns have been reported for other molecular systems  for which this interpretation has been found to be correct  <cit> . the emsa assay does not provide information about the nature of the macromolecular interactions that stabilize each protein-dna complex. thus while the formation of the first complex must involve protein-dna contacts, the interactions that stabilize higher-order complexes may include protein-protein contacts or protein-dna contacts or both. the simplest model, and the one we favor, is one in which similar mechanisms direct the binding of each protein unit to dna or pre-existing protein-dna complex. affinity data for the first two binding steps  are consistent with this picture, but do not rule out more heterogeneous binding mechanisms.

binding distributions were graphed  and analyzed according to eqs. 3– <dig> . these data are consistent with models in which  <dig> molecules of ybabhi bind free dna to form the first complex, and in which the second binding step involves the concerted binding of  <dig> additional ybabhi molecules. for these binding models, the association constants for the first and second binding steps are ka, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> and ka, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig>  assuming equipartition of binding free energies, these values correspond to apparent, monomer-equivalent dissociation constants kd, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and kd, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. these values indicate that the two best ybabhi binding sites on this dna are of nearly equal affinity; the ~2-fold difference in affinity between first and second binding steps is just what would be expected on a statistical basis for independent binding to identical sites  <cit> . parallel measurements were made for the binding of ybabec to the b-wt dna fragment . these data also indicate that  <dig> molecules of ybabec bound free dna to form the first complex and two more bound to form the second complex. the association constants for the first and second binding steps are ka, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> and ka, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig>  assuming equipartition of binding free energies as before, these correspond to monomer-equivalent dissociation constants kd, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and kd, <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. as with the h. influenzae protein, the ~2-fold difference in affinity is what would be expected for independent binding to two identical sites. we note that these binding constants reflect binding under our standard in vitro conditions and should not be interpreted to represent the corresponding affinities for binding in vivo. none of our binding data suggests that either protein can bind dna as a monomer. ybabhi and ybabec proteins crystallized as dimers, and both previous sedimentation analyses and our gel filtration analyses indicated that ybabhi exists primarily as a homodimer in solution . taken together, these data indicate that the homodimer is the basic unit of dna-binding activity for this family of proteins.

in control experiments, purified ybab proteins were treated either by incubation with  <dig> mg/ml proteinase k for  <dig> min or by heating in a boiling water bath for  <dig> min. emsa of either protease-treated or boiled ybab preparations did not yield reduced-mobility complexes or reduce the levels of free dna probe , demonstrating that the dna-binding activity in the purified ybab preparations was due to the native forms of the proteins.

b. burgdorferi ebfc binds specifically to the tetrad gtnac, and mutation of any of those  <dig> bases eliminates specific dna binding . to assess the requirements for those nucleotides on ybabec and ybabhi binding, emsas were performed using as probes either a derivative of b. burgdorferi erpab operator  <dig> that contains only  <dig> consensus ebfc-binding site  or that dna containing single bp mutations . for each protein, a concentration of one half its kd was utilized in order to show either increases or decreases in binding. note that both ybabec and ybabhi produced one protein-dna complex at these protein concentrations, whereas ebfc yielded two mobility complexes. other studies from our laboratories demonstrated that the upper  ebfc-dna complex represents specific binding to the gtnac sequence, while the lower  complex reflects a sequence-nonspecific interaction  <cit> . none of the single mutations had any detectable effect on binding by either ybabec or ybabhi . point mutations that disrupted the gtnac sequence eliminated specific binding of ebfc, but did not affect non-specific binding by that protein .

the specificity of ybab binding was further addressed by emsa using progressively greater concentrations of poly, which acts as a competitor for non-specific dna binding activities  <cit> . addition of even 500-fold excesses of poly had no measurable effect on either ybabec or ybabhi binding to the b. burgdorferi erpab operator  <dig> probe .

a previous study did not detect binding of ybabhi to any tested dna, leading to the conclusion that this protein does not bind dna in a completely sequence-independent manner  <cit> . the present work demonstrated that ybabhi, and the homologous protein of e. coli, do bind to certain dnas. ebfc, the orthologous protein of the spirochete b. burgdorferi, binds specifically to the dna sequence gtnac and, with a lower affinity, to dna lacking that sequence  <cit> . the e. coli and h. influenzae ybab proteins both exhibited preferences for certain tested dna sequences, but neither showed the same high affinity for gtnac as did the spirochetal ortholog. both ybab proteins also showed a marked preference for dna derived from the b. burgdorferi erpab promoter over poly. such large differences in affinities for target and non-target sequences may account for the previous failure to detect dna-binding by ybabhi  <cit> . these results suggest that ybabec and ybabhi have higher affinities for some dna sequences than for others, but whether those preferences depend upon a specific nucleotide sequence, a+t content, and/or dna topology remain to be determined. the three-dimensional structure of dimeric ybab resembles "tweezers", with α-helices  <dig> and  <dig> of each monomeric subunit protruding from the dimerization domains  <cit> . the spacing between the α-helical protrusions is approximately  <dig> Å at the base of the dimerization domain and approximately  <dig> Å at the distal ends of the α-helices  <cit> , similar to the diameter of b-form duplex dna . site-directed mutagenesis studies of the orthologous b. burgdorferi ebfc demonstrated that certain amino acid substitutions in either α-helix  <dig> or  <dig> of ebfc eliminate dna-binding, without affecting dimerization  <cit> . it is noteworthy that many of the α-helix  <dig> and  <dig> residues of ebfc are distinct from residues in both ybabec and ybabhi , consistent with the differences in dna preferences between the e. coli and h. influenzae ybab proteins and their spirochetal ortholog. ybab/ebfc orthologs of other bacterial species likewise exhibit sequence variations in their α-helices  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that they may also possess unique dna-binding properties.

the function of ybab/ebfc proteins remains to be determined. many bacterial ybab/ebfc orthologs are located between dnax and recr, a synteny that has led to suggestions of roles in dna replication or recombination  <cit> . while the abilities of the examined orthologs to bind dna may support those hypotheses, several lines of evidence suggest that ybab/ebfc proteins perform functions that are independent of dna recombination or replication. proteomic analyses of cultured h. influenzae detected production of ybab without accompanying production of dna repair proteins  <cit> . a ybab recr double mutant of streptomyces coelicolor exhibited recombination defects that could be complemented with recr alone  <cit> . the ybab/ebfc orthologs of some bacterial species are not linked to recr or any other recombination-related gene and some, such as the b. burgdorferi, do not even encode recr  <cit> . several bacteria, such as h. influenzae, have ybab genes located distantly from their dnax  <cit> . moreover, some ybab family genes can be transcribed independently of their upstream genes, using promoter elements within the 5' gene  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that ybabhi is in fact a dna-binding protein. it exhibits an element of specificity, in that the protein preferentially bound to b. burgdorferi erp operator  <dig> dna over poly-di-dc and, apparently, the dna sequences examined by an earlier research group  <cit> . consistent with those data, the e. coli ybab ortholog was also determined to be a dna-binding protein. for both orthologs, the basic unit of dna-binding is a homodimer, consistent with results from analyses of soluble proteins and crystallization data. the solved structures of ybabec and ybabhi are distinct from any other known dna-binding protein. genes encoding orthologs of ybab/ebfc proteins are found throughout the eubacteria, including many important human pathogens, suggesting that these proteins perform important function. thus, continued study of these unique proteins may provide insight regarding critical bacterial processes that might be exploited for infection control.
