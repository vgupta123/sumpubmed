BACKGROUND
neural tissue that survives the damaging effects of a stroke can reorganize in order to recover lost functions. the disinhibition of cortical activities can lead to the over-activation of areas belonging to the physiological neural network and of areas that are recruited to replace the functions of the damaged tissue. alternatively, cerebral activation can be inhibited in brain regions that are remote from the damaged area   <cit> . the impact of brain area over-recruitment on functional recovery was investigated by longitudinal studies that tracked the evolution of such plastic changes over time  <cit> . these studies found that there was an over-activation of certain brain areas  in the sub-acute phase followed by the progressive focusing of cerebral activation associated with clinical recovery  <cit> . in aphasic patients, this phenomenon was reported to have a tri-phasic trend from the acute to the chronic stage; the initially reduced cerebral activation was followed by an over-activation of the language cortical network in the subacute phase, which was followed by a progressive focusing of cerebral activation  <cit> .

although the use of fmri allowed investigators to make significant progresses in understanding post-stroke cerebral plasticity, blood oxygen level dependent  signals may be reduced  <cit> , absent  <cit>  or negative  <cit>  in patients with cerebro-vascular disease. cerebro-vascular diseases may also affect the shape of the hemodynamic response function  of bold signal. in particular, hrfs in such patients can have lower amplitudes, longer latency to peak intervals , and deeper initial dips  <cit> .

these findings were also reported in cases of preserved neuronal activity  <cit>  and in relation to altered cerebral hemodynamics  <cit> , which suggests that reduced bold signals might reflect the decrease of neuronal activation or be the consequence of neurovascular uncoupling. these results raise the question of whether the longitudinal changes of cerebral activation that are found during early post-stroke phases  <cit>  are due in part to cerebral hemodynamic impairment.

cerebral hemodynamics are characterized by the following two distinctive properties: autoregulation  and perfusion pressure) and vasomotor reactivity . the assessment of cerebral vasomotor reactivity requires the patient's cooperation since hypercapnia is induced by holding one's breath or by inhaling co <dig> enriched air. in addition, this test is potentially harmful for acute stroke patients since hypercapnia may increase abp. by contrast, autoregulation can be non-invasively evaluated by correlating the spontaneous oscillations of abp and cerebral blood flow velocity . this does not require any cooperation from the patient  <cit> . this correlation is measured by calculating a coefficient named mx index  <cit> . a high mx index indicates a dependence of cbfv on abp that is attributable to autoregulatory impairment.

cerebral autoregulation was reported to worsen between the acute and subacute stroke phases  <cit> . this phenomenon could be explained by arteriolar dysfunction that develops at the ischemic site and spreads to remote areas later in the post-stroke interval. it was hypothesized that a vicious circle can start in the peri-infarct area by spreading local acidosis, and then is amplified by reperfusion  with a consequent dysautoregulation  <cit> . in addition, bursts of oxidative stress induced by cerebral ischemia lead to profound alterations in cerebro-vascular regulation. in particular, reactive oxygen species can impair endothelial no-mediated responses, vasodilation , and vasoconstrictor mechanisms  <cit> . finally, hemispheric strokes can damage the central autonomic network thereby altering the neural control mechanisms of cerebral vessels  <cit> .

despite early impairment of cerebral hemodynamics, longitudinal changes of bold signal hrf in the acute and subacute stroke phases have never been explored. one hypothesis is that the deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics in early phases following a stroke can affect bold signal hrf.

this study investigated whether the impairment of cerebral hemodynamics that occurs as patients advance from the acute to the subacute stroke phase is related to changes in the bold signal hrf.

to test this hypothesis, we evaluated cerebral autoregulation  and the amplitude and peak latency  of bold responses to auditory stimuli in the auditory cortex of  <dig> aphasic patients during the acute and the subacute phases of stroke. at the time of recruitment, the patients were taking part in two ongoing longitudinal fmri studies on language recovery.

cerebral hemodynamic parameters are listed in table  <dig>  cbvf did not differ significantly between the two hemispheres in either the acute  or in subacute stroke phase . no variation of cbvf was observed between ex  <dig> and ex  <dig> in the two hemispheres , p =  <dig> ; unaffected hemisphere , p =  <dig> ).

mean
parad  <dig> and 2: language paradigm  <dig> and  <dig> respectively; ex  <dig> and ex 2: days from stroke onset; nihss nih stroke scale at the first examination time  and at the second examination time ; ttp: time to peak expressed in seconds and ampl: peak amplitude of bold.; ah: affected hemisphere, uh: unaffected hemisphere; cbfv: mean mca cerebral blood flow velocity expressed in cm/s; mx index: correlation coefficient between cbfv and arterial blood pressure; mean : mean values ; in the bottom raw p values for comparison of each measure from ex  <dig> to ex  <dig> are reported, and evidenced in bold in case of statistical significance.

at ex  <dig>  the mx index did not differ between the hemispheres , though the mx index was higher at ex  <dig>  in the ah as compared with the uh . the mx index increased between examinations in the ah  and not significantly in uh 

fmri findings
mean
paradigm  <dig> and 2: language paradigm  <dig> and  <dig> respectively; ttp: time to peak expressed in seconds and ampl: peak amplitude of bold; r: right hemisphere; l: left hemisphere. please note that differences in the mean amplitude values between table  <dig> and figures  <dig> and  <dig> are due to the fact, that in the table values were extracted from individual peak voxels, while in the figures they were extracted from the group peak voxel.

ttp measurements did not reveal differences between the two hemispheres at ex  <dig>  or ex  <dig> . at ex  <dig> ttp was delayed  in the ah and in the uh with a trend toward significance .

at both examination times, amplitude measurements did not reveal differences between hemispheres . between ex  <dig> and ex  <dig>  amplitude did not change in the uh , while it tended to decrease with a trend toward significance in the ah .

figures  <dig> and  <dig> contain estimations of the hemodynamic response function  in six healthy subjects  and one representative patient  for language paradigms  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

to analyze a possible correlation between ttp elongation and mx increase, we first calculated the variation between ex  <dig> and ex  <dig> for each parameter. we found that bold peak delays correlated with worsening cerebral auto-regulation . this result was obtained after taking into consideration, through the use of a generalized estimating equations model, both hemispheres and the within-subject dependence.

discussion
our main finding is that the progressive worsening of cerebral hemodynamics is related to an increased latency of the bold signal hrf from the acute to the subacute stroke phase.

increases in bold peak latency were previously observed in patients with cerebro-vascular stenotic disease  <cit>  and in patients with chronic aphasia  <cit> . bold peak latency increases were also analyzed in relation to clinical outcome  <cit> . different hypotheses can explain the findings in these studies. during activation tasks, delayed bold peak latency can be the effect of initial oxidative metabolism wherein an increase in deoxy-hemoglobin is followed by a slower increase in oxy-hemoglobin and regional cerebral blood flow. in patients suffering from internal carotid or intracranial steno-occlusive disease, this phenomenon could be due to the vasodilatation of the arterioles down-stream from the stenosis, which increases the regional cortical blood volume at rest. in this condition, an additional increase of blood flow during neural activation is necessary for the detection of a bold response. when evaluating fmri activation in a damaged cortex, the ttp increase might depend on the increased oxygen extraction fraction due to decreased oxygen delivery during activation  <cit> .

in contrast to previous studies reporting a ttp increase in the damaged cortex of chronic patients  <cit>  or in asymptomatic patients with vascular steno-occlusive disease  <cit> , we found increases in bold peak latency in preserved cerebral cortices  and in absence of steno-occlusive diseases. in our patients, a longer peak latency of bold hrf could be the consequence of a general deterioration of arteriolar endothelial/smooth muscle cell function, which impairs cerebral auto-regulation  <cit>  and limits the increase of regional blood flow  produced by functional activation  <cit> .

on the other hand, neither bold hrf nor cerebral auto-regulation was altered in the acute stroke phase. this suggests that an alteration of cerebral hemodynamics alone cannot explain the impairment of bold signal in acute stroke patients. decreased fmri activation, which was previously reported in the acute stroke phase  <cit> , could actually reflect lower levels of neuronal firing also in cortical areas distant from the ischemic lesion. the following potential reasons for such reduced neuronal function can be hypothesized: an initial "stunned" brain phenomenon that is functioning as a protective mechanism  <cit> ; cellular and metabolic changes; prolonged hypoperfusion despite recanalization; and incomplete infarction with neuronal dysfunction after critical hypoperfusion  <cit> . an alternative explanation may involve the functional-anatomic location of the lesion and its participation in a neuronal network   <cit> .

previous studies have reported that hemodynamic impairment can affect fmri signal detection  <cit> . in the chronic stroke phase, bold hrfs can have decreased amplitudes and longer latencies to peak  <cit> . the present study confirms these findings and reports for the first time the dynamic variations of bold signals from the acute to the subacute stroke phase as they relate to cerebral hemodynamic deterioration. this may provide additional knowledge for the interpretation of early changes in post-stroke fmri activation.

new fmri studies are targeting early cerebral reorganization within the acute and sub acute stroke phases, probably responsible for initial clinical recovery and for long-term outcome. however, our findings recommend caution when interpreting results from longitudinal studies. changes in bold activation could be either the result of cerebral reorganization or the effects of hemodynamic impairment over time. in particular, if the hrf of bold signal detected in stroke patients has a ttp different from that normally assumed, the analysis fmri data might be invalidated. the main limitation of our study is the small number of patients enrolled. in fact, this may have lead to an underestimation of other longitudinal changes of bold hrf . in addition, since hypertension and other vascular factors can influence cerebral hemodynamics and thereby affect bold signals  <cit> , a control population with vascular factors comparable to our patients would allow us to better compare ttp values between the two groups. we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed increases in ttp in our patients were the consequence of their additional vascular ailments rather than the result of the stroke itself. similarly, in order to assess whether ttp could be considered a stable measure in different examinations, control subjects should have undergone fmri at two different times.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate a longitudinal change in bold hrf that is possibly due to the sub-acute impairment of cerebral hemodynamics. our findings suggest that remodeling the fmri hrf and adapting other parameters  for different stroke phases may optimize the detection of bold signal changes. in addition, an integrated analysis that includes neurophysiological techniques or hemodynamic evaluation should be used also in longitudinal studies that investigate cerebral plastic reorganization via metabolic signal based imaging methods.

further studies are needed to confirm our findings for different stroke types and vascular territories and to assess the extent the mean ttp delay in the sub-acute stroke phase in a larger population. this would be useful for adapting the hemodynamic function that underlies the bold-signal in the analysis of cerebral activation data from patients in the subacute post-stroke phase.
