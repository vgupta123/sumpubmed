BACKGROUND
aluminum  toxicity is a major limiting factor for crop production on acid soils, which make up over 30% of the world’s arable soils and up to 70% of the potential arable land  <cit> . on acidic soils with ph below  <dig> , phytotoxic forms of al  are solubilized into the soil solution, which inhibit root growth and thereafter limit water and mineral nutrient uptake, resulting in losses of crop yield  <cit> . to grow on al-toxic environments, some plant species have evolved resistance mechanisms that enable them to tolerate toxic levels of al.

al-activated organic acid release from roots is a well-documented mechanism of al detoxification  <cit> . organic acids such as malate, citrate and oxalate are able to chelate al and thereby attenuate al toxicity. different plants secrete different organic acids to detoxify al. for example, wheat , oilseed rape  and arabidopsis thaliana secrete malate after exposure to al stress  <cit> , while al-tolerant cultivars of snapbean , rice bean , maize , and soybean  release citrate in response to al stress  <cit> . oxalate can be secreted from the roots of buckwheat, tomato and spinach  upon exposure to al stress  <cit> . recently, genes responsible for the al-activated secretion of malate and citrate have been identified. sasaki et al.  <cit>  cloned the first al-resistant gene almt <dig> in wheat, which encodes a plasma membrane transporter to transport malate from root cells to the rhizosphere for the chelation and detoxification of al. genes for citrate secretion were independently identified in barley  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit> , which were found to encode members of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  family. to date, genes involved in oxalate release have not been identified.

using mutant screening and map-based gene cloning approaches on the model plants, rice and arabidopsis, recent studies have unraveled some common al-tolerant mechanisms in plants. art1/stop <dig> is a c2h2-type zinc-finger transcription factor, which is required for al tolerance through regulation of downstream al tolerance genes in both rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . star <dig> and star2/als <dig> encode a nucleotide-binding domain and a transmembrane domain of an abc  transporter, respectively. star <dig> and star2/asl <dig> form a complex to transport udp-glucose for the modification of cell walls thereby detoxifying al  <cit> . als <dig> encodes a half-size abc transporter and is involved in sequestering al into the vacuoles for the internal detoxification of al  <cit> . although the functions of star <dig>  star2/als <dig> and als <dig> in al tolerance are conserved in plants, their expression patterns differ between rice and arabidopsis. in general, the expression level and the level of induction by al stress of these genes are higher in the al-tolerant species rice than in the al-sensitive species arabidopsis, suggesting that al-tolerant species may require increased expression of these conserved al-tolerance genes to overcome al stress.

common buckwheat  is an al-tolerant species and can accumulate al to levels as high as  <dig>  ppm in leaves, when grown on acid soils, without displaying symptoms of al toxicity  <cit> . physiological studies have demonstrated that common buckwheat secretes oxalate to detoxify al externally and utilizes oxalate to chelate and sequester al in the vacuoles of both roots and shoots for internal detoxification  <cit> . although oxalate is required for al translocation in buckwheat, al in the xylem appears to be complexed with citrate instead of oxalate, suggesting that al may undergo a ligand exchange from oxalate to citrate when al is transported into the xylem  <cit> . however, understanding the molecular mechanisms of al tolerance in buckwheat has been hampered by the lack of the genomic sequence and transcriptomic data under al stress.

recent advances in high-throughput mrna sequencing  offer the capability to discover new genes and transcripts and to quantify gene expression simultaneously. in the present study, we used the rna-seq technique to analyze the transcriptome of different root zones of tartary buckwheat  in response to al treatment. tartary buckwheat was chosen in our study because it is an al-accumulating species  <cit>  but unlike common buckwheat, is self-pollinating, which makes it easier to assemble transcripts and to conduct further gene function analysis. we constructed high-quality genome-wide transcripts and examined the expression profile of al-responsive genes in this buckwheat species. combined with quantitative rt-pcr and phylogenetic analysis, our results revealed novel aspects of al-tolerant mechanisms in tartary buckwheat.

RESULTS
al accumulation pattern in tartary buckwheat
to compare al accumulation by tartary buckwheat and common buckwheat, we exposed plants of both species to different al concentrations for  <dig> d intermittently in a hydroponic experiment. both species accumulated appreciable amounts of al in the roots and shoots in the control treatment , suggesting that both buckwheat species efficiently took up the background level of al in the nutrient solution. in the treatments with 10–50 μm al, tartary buckwheat accumulated significantly more al in the roots than common buckwheat . tartary buckwheat accumulated higher concentrations of al in the shoots than common buckwheat in the 10 μm al treatment, whereas shoot al concentrations were similar between the two species in the higher al treatments  .figure  <dig>

. two-week-old seedlings were exposed to a series of al concentrations  for  <dig> d intermittently. the al concentrations in roots  and shoots  and the ratio of shoot to root al concentrations  were analyzed, respectively. data are means ± sd . means with different letters are significantly different .



in both species, the al translocation efficiency from roots to shoots decreased with increasing al concentration in the solution . the shoot to root al concentration ratio in tartary buckwheat decreased from  <dig>  in the control treatment to  <dig>  in the 50 μm al treatment. this result suggests that xylem loading of al might be the rate-limiting step controlling al accumulation in the shoots in buckwheat.

de novo assembly of the transcripts and annotation
for rna-seq analysis, tartary buckwheat plants were treated with 50 μm al for a short period of time . at this concentration root elongation was inhibited by 76% compared to the control . root tips and basal roots from both the control and + al treatments were sampled for rna isolation and illumina paired-end rna-seq. rna-seq generated a range of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  million clean reads on each sample . in total there were  <dig>  million clean reads from all samples with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides per read and a gc content of  <dig> % gc. these were used for the assembly of the transcripts. because the genome sequence of buckwheat is not available, a de novo assembly method, the trinity method  <cit> , was used to construct the transcripts and  <dig>  transcript contigs were assembled. in order to reduce the redundancy and chimeras of the transcripts, we used cap <dig> software to combine highly similar transcripts and retain the longest transcripts with the highest read coverage, and removed the transcripts with the lowest read coverage  <cit> . as a result, the number of contigs was further reduced to  <dig>  . the assembled contigs had a length distribution from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with an average length of 1184 bp . the average coverage for each assembled contig is  <dig> reads per base, indicating a high read coverage of the contigs.figure  <dig> 
distribution of the length of transcript assembly contigs.




recently, logacheva et al.  <cit>  performed transcriptome sequencing in f. tataricum by  <dig> sequencing. in comparison with their results, we produced more assembled contigs  and a longer average contig length  . moreover,  <dig> % of the contigs from the study of logacheva et al.  <cit>  were covered in our assembled transcripts. therefore, the assembled contigs in our study should provide a useful resource for future research on f. tataricum.table  <dig>

blast searches revealed that  <dig>  of  <dig>  contigs had significant matches in the ncbi non-redundant protein database. gene ontology  analysis of the matched contigs identified  <dig> genes that were categorized into different go groups . some of the gene categories are partially redundant, which led to some genes being categorized into more than one group. in the molecular function category, genes assigned to the “catalytic activity” and “binding ” groups are highly enriched. in the cellular component category, genes in the “cell” and “intracellular” groups were the most abundant. in the biological process category, the “cellular process” and “macromolecule metabolism” groups contain the highest number of genes .figure  <dig>

calculation and validation of rna-seq expression data
the expression of each gene from the rna-seq data was calculated by reads per kilobase of exons per million mapped reads. although we used all  <dig> samples for the assembly of the transcripts, all genes identified had read coverage on each sample , suggesting that our rna sequencing of each sample was deep enough to allow expression analyses for all the genes. to verify the rna-seq expression data, we selected  <dig> genes displaying diverse expression profiles in the root tips and/or basal roots for real-time rt-pcr analysis. a significant correlation  was observed between two data sets . these results confirm the reliability of our rna-seq expression data.figure  <dig>

global effect of al stress on gene expression
in the root tips, there are  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated | ≥  <dig>  fdr  ≤  <dig> ) under al stress . although root tips are known to be the main sites for al detoxification, we found that there were also a large number of genes affected in the basal roots by al stress, with  <dig> genes being upregulated and  <dig> genes being downregulated . go enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes in both root tips and basal roots were significantly overrepresented in four categories: “response to stimulus”, “antioxidant activity”, “extracellular” and “cell death”  , although the upregulated genes in the “cell death” group were not significantly enriched in the basal roots due to the strict cut-off criteria used. this result suggests that defensive genes and genes encoding extracellular-localized proteins, such as cell wall components, were preferentially induced in expression by al stress. the upregulated genes in the root tips and basal roots were also subjected to kegg pathway enrichment analysis. genes in two pathways, “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism” and “lipid metabolism”, were significantly enriched in both the root tip and basal root region . the enrichment of genes in the lipid metabolism pathway supports the observation that al can interfere with the function of the plasma membrane and induce its lipid peroxidation  <cit> . together, these results suggest that al toxicity can act on both the root tip and the basal root region and that both regions have evolved some common mechanisms of al responsiveness in buckwheat. further support for this statement came from the fact that a large portion of the upregulated or downregulated genes were shared between the root tips and the basal root region, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes being upregulated and downregulated in both root regions, respectively . by contrast, genes in “carbohydrate metabolism” pathway were only significantly enriched in the root tip region, and genes in four pathways, “signal transduction”, “environmental adaptation”, “immune system” and “sensory system” were overrepresented in the basal roots but not in the root tips under al stress . expression analysis also showed that some genes were upregulated or downregulated only in the root tips or the basal roots . therefore, the root tip and basal root region may also possess different mechanisms of al responsiveness in buckwheat.table  <dig>

effect of al on the expression of organic acid metabolism and secretion-related genes
secretion of oxalate from the root tips in response to al and chelation of al by oxalate within root cells are well-characterized mechanisms of al tolerance in buckwheat  <cit> . we therefore investigated the effect of al on the expression of genes involved in organic acid synthesis or metabolism. the results showed that the expression of genes putatively involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including key enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, was not induced by al stress , which is consistent with evidence that organic acid metabolism is not a rate-limiting step for al-induced release of organic acids  <cit> . interestingly, we found that two genes belonging to the mate  family were induced in expression in both the root tips and basal roots by al stress . phylogenetic analysis indicated that the two mate members, ftfrdl <dig> and ftfrdl <dig>  clustered with the citrate transporter atfrd <dig>  a founding member of the frd <dig> subfamily . although the basal expression of ftfrdl <dig> in the absence of al was higher than that of ftfrdl <dig>  the latter was more induced by al, resulting in a similar expression level of the two genes after exposure to the al stress . the mate genes from the frd <dig> clade have been shown to be involved in transporting citrate  <cit> . although al-activated citrate secretion is not the al-tolerance mechanism in buckwheat, citrate might be transported into the xylem for al chelation and translocation  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the two mate genes are involved in the release of citrate into the xylem.figure  <dig>

expression and phylogenetic analysis of al-tolerance gene homologs
a number of genes required for al tolerance in rice and arabidopsis have been cloned and characterized recently. to understand the mechanisms of al tolerance in the al hyperaccumulator buckwheat, we performed expression and phylogenetic analysis of homologs of four conserved al-tolerance genes in rice and arabidopsis, art1/stop <dig>  als <dig>  star <dig> and star2/als <dig>  we identified two homologs of art <dig>  namely arl <dig> and arl <dig>  in buckwheat. phylogenetic analysis indicated that both arl <dig> and arl <dig> are closer to arabidopsis stop <dig> than to rice art <dig> , suggesting that the duplication event of art <dig> in buckwheat happened after the dicot-monocot split. real-time rt-pcr analysis showed that both arl <dig> and arl <dig> were equally expressed in the root tips and basal roots, and their expression was not affected by the al treatment .figure  <dig>

there were two als <dig> homologs found in buckwheat. interestingly, one of the als <dig> homologs  is closer to rice osals <dig>  whereas the other  is closer to arabidopsis atals <dig> , suggesting that als <dig> duplication in buckwheat occurred before the split of monocots and dicots. expression analysis showed that ftalol <dig> transcript accumulation was higher than that of ftalol <dig> in the roots, and that ftalol <dig> expression was induced by the al stress, to a greater extent in the root tips compared with the basal roots . by contrast, the expression of ftalol <dig> was downregulated by the al treatment.

we identified two homologs of star <dig>  stol <dig> and stol <dig> , in buckwheat. both stol <dig> and stol <dig> fall into the dicot group , suggesting that star <dig> was duplicated in buckwheat after the evolutionary divergence of dicots and monocots. quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed that the expression level of stol <dig> was more than  <dig> fold higher than that of stol <dig> in the roots , and the expression of stol <dig> was induced in both the root tips and the basal root region by al stress, but that of stol <dig> was not. these results suggest that stol <dig> may play a major role for al tolerance in buckwheat roots. whether stol <dig> plays an important role in the shoots requires further investigation. in contrast to star <dig>  there was only one homolog of star <dig> in buckwheat . the expression of ftstar <dig> in both the root tips and the basal root region was highly induced by al stress .

discussion
similar to common buckwheat, tartary buckwheat was able to accumulate high levels of al in the roots and shoots in a short-term hydroponic experiment . this result is consistent with a recent report showing that tartary buckwheat shares similar mechanisms of al detoxification and accumulation with common buckwheat species  <cit> .

through illumina high-throughput mrna sequencing and de novo assembly of the transcripts with an optimized method, we constructed nearly  <dig>  transcript contigs of high quality in tartary buckwheat . compared with previous  <dig> sequencing in f. tataricum  <cit> , our high-throughput mrna sequencing generated  <dig> fold more nucleotides and therefore enabled us to assemble more contigs and obtain longer transcripts . when we cloned full transcripts of the gene homologs of frd <dig>  art <dig>  als <dig>  star <dig> and star <dig> by 5′-race and 3′-race pcr in buckwheat, we found that in fact all the homologs had full length open reading frames  in our assembled contigs, whereas the orfs of the homologs from previous  <dig> sequencing data were incomplete . thus, our assembled transcripts provide a platform for future research on buckwheat.

our differential expression analysis of rna-seq data revealed that a large number of genes upregulated or downregulated by al stress were shared in the root tips and basal roots , which suggested that at the cellular level, al toxicity might not be restricted to the root tip cells, but can also act on the basal root cells. this result is consistent with a previous report that al could affect the expression of some genes in both the root tip and basal root region of rice  <cit> . go and kegg enrichment analysis revealed that genes categorized into “response to stimulus”, “antioxidant activity” and “lipid metabolism” were preferentially induced in expression by al stress , which supported previous observations that al can induce the peroxidation of lipids and the production of reactive oxygen species , and that plant roots are able to increase the expression of antioxidant genes such as glutathione s-transferase  genes to cope with al toxicity  <cit> . additionally, the expression of genes categorized as “extracellular” or putatively involved in “carbohydrate metabolism” were also increased in the root tips in response to al, which was consistent with the concept that the root cell wall is the primary target site of al toxicity  <cit> .

both common and tartary buckwheat are able to secrete oxalate to chelate and detoxify al in the rhizosphere  <cit> , although the genes responsible for the release of oxalate from the roots have not been identified. there are two temporal patterns adopted by plants for al-activated organic acid release  <cit> . in pattern i, exudation of organic acids is rapidly activated by al exposure and there is no discernible delay observed between the addition of al and the onset of organic acid anion release, whereas in pattern ii the secretion of organic acids is delayed for several hours after exposure to al. the secretion of oxalate in buckwheat is rapid and at a constant level after the exposure to al  <cit> , consistent with a pattern i response. recent reports on wheat almt <dig> and barley hvaact <dig> indicate that the expression of genes encoding transporters for the secretion of organic acid in pattern i is constitutive and not responsive to al stress  <cit> . therefore, it will be difficult to use rna-seq analysis to identify the genes responsible for the exudation of oxalate in buckwheat since their expression might not be affected by al stress. an alternative approach could be to screen mutants defective in oxalate secretion, followed by cloning of the responsive genes through map-based cloning techniques, to isolate genes encoding oxalate transporters.

interestingly, we found that the expression of two homologs of frd <dig> was highly induced by the al treatment . the mate genes in the frd <dig> subgroup have been demonstrated to be involved in the translocation of iron through the release of citrate to the xylem or in al tolerance through citrate release to the rhizosphere in arabidopsis  <cit> . although buckwheat secretes oxalate instead of citrate to the rhizosphere for the detoxification of al, it is possible that the plant may release citrate to the xylem for the translocation of al because the al-citrate complex is the predominant form of al in the xylem  <cit> , which could be mediated by the frd3-like transporters in buckwheat. similarly, release of citrate into the xylem is required for iron translocation in both dicot and monocot species  <cit> . the requirement for citrate in the xylem translocation of both iron and al in buckwheat would need to be coordinated closely. because buckwheat hyperaccumulates al in the shoots, the amount of citrate required for al translocation in the xylem could be substantial. in the presence of al, the amount of citrate release to the xylem would have to be increased, triggering the induction of genes involved in citrate release. the increased expression of the two frd <dig> homologous genes under al treatment supports our speculation. in the future, it will be critical to determine whether the two genes are involved in the translocation of al and/or iron in buckwheat and to examine how al activates the expression of the two genes.

the requirement of art1/stop <dig>  als <dig>  star <dig> and star2/als <dig> for al tolerance appears to be conserved and ubiquitous in monocot and dicot species, and they do not have close homologs in the rice and arabidopsis genomes  <cit> . by contrast, we found that three of the four genes had been duplicated in buckwheat . the two homologs of art <dig>  a putative zinc-finger transcription factor, were expressed at a similar level and largely unaffected by the al stress , similar to the expression pattern of art <dig> and stop <dig>  it remains to be demonstrated whether the two homologs are redundant or have different tissue-specific expression patterns. it will be also interesting to investigate whether the two art <dig> homologs are required for al translocation and accumulation in the shoots of buckwheat. in contrast to the art <dig> homologs, the two homologs of star <dig>  a putative abc transporter, displayed an unequal expression pattern, with ftstol <dig> accumulating to a higher level than ftstol <dig> in the roots . furthermore, the expression of ftstol <dig> was highly induced by the al treatment, whereas that of ftstol <dig> was unaffected. these results suggest that ftstol <dig> is the major gene required for al tolerance in the roots of buckwheat. although ftstol <dig> had greater sequence similarity to arabidopsis atstar <dig> than to rice star <dig> , the expression pattern of ftstol <dig> was similar to rice star <dig>  arabidopsis atstar <dig> is mainly expressed in the root tip region and is not responsive to al stress  <cit> , whereas both buckwheat ftstol <dig> and rice star <dig> were equally expressed in both the root tip and basal root region and their expression was highly induced by al  <cit> . unlike star <dig> homologs, there was only one homolog of star <dig> in buckwheat. the expression of ftstar <dig> was also greatly increased after exposure to al stress , which reinforced the view that al-induced expression of star <dig> is a conserved mechanism in plants since previous reports also showed that rice star <dig> and arabidopsis als <dig> were increased in expression after exposure to al  <cit> .

whereas the duplication of art1/stop <dig> and star <dig> appears to occur after the divergence of dicots and monocots, als <dig> duplication may have occurred before the split of monocots and dicots . in fact, duplication of als <dig> appears to be an ancient event because the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has two copies of als <dig> in its genome . while many plants appear to have lost one copy of als <dig>  tartary buckwheat retains both copies. we also found that tea  has two copies of als <dig> . as both buckwheat and tea are al hyperaccumulators and highly tolerant to al stress, these results suggest that retaining two als <dig> copies might be a common feature for al hyperaccumulators with both homologs playing important roles in the tolerance and/or distribution of al. in addition, although phylogenetic analysis showed that ftalol <dig> was closer to arabidopsis atals <dig> , the expression pattern of ftalol <dig> was more like that of rice osals <dig> . atals <dig> was preferentially expressed in the root tip region and its expression was not affected by the al treatment  <cit> , whereas both ftalol <dig> and osals <dig> had greater expression in the basal roots than in the root tips, and their expression was induced by al in both root regions  <cit> . conversely, ftalol <dig> expression was not induced by al stress even though ftalol <dig> had greater sequence similarity to the monocot osals <dig>  than to the dicot atals <dig> . in the future, it will be essential to determine the in vivo function of the two als <dig> homologs in buckwheat and to examine whether they have redundant functions in al tolerance and/or accumulation in roots and shoots of buckwheat.

compared with the al-sensitive species arabidopsis, the al-tolerance species rice is able to express high levels of the conserved al-tolerance genes in the presence of al to overcome al stress. similar to rice, tartary buckwheat also showed high expression of the al-tolerance gene homologs under al stress, although the al-tolerance species buckwheat is evolutionarily closer to arabidopsis than rice . these suggest that buckwheat has evolved high expression of al-tolerance genes to detoxify al. in addition, buckwheat has experienced gene duplication of art1/stop <dig>  star <dig> and als <dig>  since buckwheat can accumulate high levels of al in addition to having high tolerance to al, gene duplication might be important for buckwheat to coordinate the al tolerance and al accumulation in roots and shoots. in this regard, it is interesting to note that zinc/cadmium hyperaccumulation in arabidopsis halleri also involves duplication of key genes responsible for metal translocation and detoxification  <cit> . further functional analysis by creating knock-down or knock-out mutants will be required to reveal the role of each homologous gene in al detoxification and accumulation in buckwheat.

CONCLUSIONS
through genome-wide mrna sequencing analysis, we constructed about  <dig>  high-quality transcripts in tartary buckwheat, which provide a sequence basis for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of al tolerance and accumulation in buckwheat. our rna-seq analysis reveals that the root tip and the basal root region of tartary buckwheat may possess both common and different mechanisms of al responsiveness and that organic acid metabolism is not the rate-limiting step for organic acid secretion induced by al in buckwheat. we propose that xylem loading of al may be a rate-limiting step for the translocation of al from roots to shoots in buckwheat and that two putative citrate transporters, ftfrdl <dig> and ftfrdl <dig>  may be required for the translocation of al via the release of citrate into the xylem for complexation with al. we also propose that buckwheat has experienced duplication and subfunctionlization of key genes to coordinate the al tolerance and al accumulation.
