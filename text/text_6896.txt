BACKGROUND
oxidative stress has been shown to contribute to apoptotic cell death occurring in aids-dementia complex   <cit> . despite the demonstrated role of free radicals in adc, the mechanism underlying hiv related oxidative damage of central nervous system  is still unknown. hiv- <dig> proteins such as gp <dig> and tat can cause free radical production, possibly as part of their signal-transduction pathways activation  <cit> . it has previously been shown that gp <dig> can cause lipid peroxidation and production of hydroxynonenal esters  <cit>  which in turn can mediate oxidative stress induced apoptosis of cultured neurons and cause cognitive dysfunction in vivo  <cit> . significantly, greater numbers of apoptotic astrocytes were detected in the brain of hiv/aids patients with rapidly progressing dementia  <cit> , and detection of apoptotic astrocytes appeared to be more common in patients with dementia, compared to non-demented hiv/aids patients  <cit> , suggesting a role for astrocytic cell loss in the neuropathogenesis of hiv- <dig> associated dementia . it has been demonstrated that incubation of human cultured astroglial cells with the supernatants of hiv- <dig> infected monocytes derived macrophages  leads to apoptotic cell death of astrocytes , an effect that is driven by overproduction of superoxide anions  <cit> . oxidative stress contributes to many aspects of hiv- <dig> disease pathogenesis, including viral replication, inflammatory response, decreased immune-cell proliferation and loss of immune function  <cit> ; moreover, it leads to the production of reactive oxygen species that can attack lipid membranes, proteins, and deoxynucleic acids resulting in cellular dysfunction and cell death  <cit> . moreover, cellular oxidative stress levels directly and quantitatively determine the rate of telomere shortening  <cit> . telomeres are heterochromatin regions at the end of linear chromosomes, composed of a double-stranded region  and of a single stranded extremity , responsible for chromosome stability and cell viability  <cit> . more recently, experimental evidence has accrued that addresses the challenging question of if and how telomere length regulation may contribute to normal human aging or to human disease  <cit> . the presence of telomeres, constituted by short, tandem dna repeats of the 5'-n-3'sequence and a multitude of associated proteins, distinguishes the natural ends of chromosomes from random dna breaks, thereby preventing unwanted end-to-end fusion or nucleolytic degradation  <cit> . a dysfunctional telomere is detected as damaged dna and results in activation of the dna-damage checkpoint, and increased apoptosis  <cit> . apoptotic loss of progenitor cells in response to telomere shortening stimuli has been clearly demonstrated in animal models; e.g., mice with shortened dysfunctional telomeres demonstrate increased apoptosis in germ cells of the testes and crypt cells of the intestine  <cit> . in these systems, an increase in apoptosis correlates with tissue atrophy and other phenotypes associated with premature aging. the principal protein involved in telomere maintenance in human cells is the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase, that adds the repetitive sequences to the ends of chromosomes, thus compensating for the end replication problem and thus stabilizes the lengths of telomeres, allowing cells to divide indefinitely  <cit> . in general, somatic cells do not express telomerase and their replicative potential is limited by progressive telomere shortening, eventually resulting in the onset of cellular senescence. in contrast, cells that constitutively express telomerase are able to divide almost indefinitely  <cit> . in vitro infection of human pbmc with hiv- <dig> down-modulates telomerase activity  <cit>  that is down-regulated at both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments  <cit> . oxidative stress is responsible for telomere shortening accelerations in human fibroblast in vitro  <cit> . free radicals enhance induction of telomeric single strand breaks leading to the loss of the distal fragments of telomeric dna following replication  <cit> . further studies have shown that telomeric dna is a preferential target for oxidative damage  <cit>  and accelerated telomere shortening has been detected in cells from patients with mutations in mitochondrial dna characterized by an increased production of reactive oxygen species  <cit>  but the relative contributions of these different mechanisms to telomere shortening still remain unknown, although oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the major causes of telomere shortening  <cit> . the relationship among neuroaids/oxidative stress and oxidative stress/telomere and telomerase modulation is an important issue for better understand the role of the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and telomerase activity regulation in hiv-related neuroimmune disorders. the purpose of our work was to evaluate the link existing between hiv-1-induced oxidative stress and cellular damage, such as apoptosis, alterations of telomeric structures and glutathione  redox system in a human astrocytoma cell line.

RESULTS
hiv- <dig> mediated apoptosis in human astrocytoma cell line
apoptosis has been evaluated and statistically analyzed in hiv- <dig> exposed u <dig>  nac treated and hiv-1-exposed u <dig>  in mock hiv-infected and not nac treated u <dig>  and in nac treated u <dig> at day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig> post exposure. we chose the days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> because in these days it is possible to observe an increment of apoptosis; after the day  <dig> we can observe only a plateau. hiv-p <dig> antigen production in supernatants of hiv- <dig> exposed astrocytes was negative . a significant induction of apoptosis was seen in a time dependent fashion with a maximum of  <dig> % at day  <dig> post exposure in hiv- <dig> iiib exposed u <dig>  in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> bal the value of apoptosis at day  <dig> is only  <dig> %; so the increment of apoptosis at day  <dig> for hiv- <dig> iiib is around 80%, whereas for hiv- <dig> bal is around 21%. for this reason in our experiments we used the hiv- <dig> iiib. apoptosis in hiv- <dig> exposed samples observed at day  <dig> and  <dig> was three and four fold higher compared to negative control, respectively . hiv- <dig> mediated apoptosis was reduced in u <dig> by treatment with the antioxidant compound nac , ; this result underlines the role of oxidative stress in the apoptotic process. viability test by using trypan blue, at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  revealed that the nac treatment is not toxic for the cells.

these results were confirmed by ultrastructural studies with electron microscopy. at day  <dig> after exposure to hiv- <dig> iiib, astrocytes showed an increase of plasmamembrane protrusions and in many cells, a developed cytoplasmic blabbing and large vacuoles as a result of cytoplasmic loss  as compared to the control cell line . moreover the chromatin was seen condensed and marginalized . the effect of hiv on astroglial cells was antagonized strongly by coincubation with nac . in particular, we found that in nac-pretreated astrocytes, cells maintained the normal architecture and the normal ratio between nucleus and cytoplasm, and nuclei appeared almost completely normal . the treatment with nac on control cell line did not induce any change .

hiv- <dig> exposure induces the telomeres shortening in human astrocytoma cell line
to observe the correlation between astrocytic apoptosis and telomeres shortening the q-fish staining was performed on metaphase using the fluorescent pna telomeric probe labeled with cy <dig>  co-hybridisation was done with cy- <dig> telomeric-pna probe and cy- <dig> centromeric-pna probe. each data was shown as percentage of t/c  ratio . at the same time point of apoptosis evaluation, the analysis of telomere length showed a statistically significant telomere shortening in hiv-exposed samples compared to negative control of mock hiv- <dig> exposed cells; this is in agreement to the observed increase of apoptotic cells  indicating a possible telomere role in cellular surviving, at the days of the analysis. on the other hand, the results obtained from nac pretreatment of hiv- <dig> exposed cells at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  show a statistically significant inhibition of telomere shortening indicating a telomere protective effect of this antioxidant against the oxidative stress-induced damage . in the figure  <dig> it is shown an interesting telomere lengthening, probably due to the nac activity against an endogen oxidative intracellular status. in figure  <dig> we can observe a color image q-fish staining on metaphase performed on metaphase chromosomes with fluorescent pna telomeric probe.

with these results we can suppose that the telomeres, preferential target for oxidative damage, could be the key sensor of cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress after hiv- <dig> exposure.

telomerase activity is not modulated in hiv- <dig> exposed and/or nac treated human astrocytoma cell line
to evaluate if the reduction of telomere shortening is due to the telomerase modulation, we analyzed the telomerase activity in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> by using the trap assay, at the same treatment time points used for q-fish analysis. as expected, u <dig> cell line express telomerase activity as usually observed in tumor cell lines. interestingly, the data indicate no telomerase modulation in hiv- or nac treated- hiv exposed u <dig> cells compared to the control. in fact, where we observed telomere shortening, we can't point out an enhanced or reduced telomerase activity . these data indicate no correlation between telomere length modulation and telomerase activity suggesting that nac is able to act preventing the telomere shortening not by restoring the telomere length suggesting that the antioxidant protective effects does not occur via telomere elongation but most likely by restoring the oxidant status of the cells.

hiv- <dig> modulates the gsh levels and gsh/gssg ratio in human astrocytoma cell line
hplc was employed for evaluation of the cellular levels of the reduced or oxidized form of the cysteine-containing peptide glutathione  in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> iiib and exposed, where requested, to nac. as it is shown in the figure  <dig> the levels of gsh , measured by hplc, in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> iiib, decreased compared to negative control of not hiv- <dig> exposed cells at several days . moreover we can observe that the nac-treatment of u <dig> hiv- <dig> exposed, is able to restore the gsh levels at the same time points. the gsh/gssg ratio, in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> iiib, also decreased compared with control of not hiv- <dig> exposed cells, the ratio significantly increased with nac treatment .

the gsh/gssg ratio, in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> iiib, decreases compared with control of not hiv- <dig> exposed cells. the ratio significantly increased with nac treatment. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  when compared vs control; §p <  <dig> , §§ p <  <dig> , §§§ p <  <dig> , when compared vs hiv.

discussion
hiv infection is still pandemic with more than  <dig> million people infected today. in europe, most of the 50% of hiv-affected patients and about 80% of aids affected patients undergo cognitive dysfunction which is indicated, at the late stage, as aids-dementia complex  <cit> . the neuropathogenesis of hiv-infection and therapeutic approaches for treatment of neurological disturbances accompanying aids still remain to be identified. overall data suggest that the mechanism that lead to neuronal, as well as non-neuronal damage, in the brain of aids patients may involve the combined effect of more than one neurotoxic factor. oxidative stress and the alteration of the homeostasis induced by hiv- <dig> infection, have shown to contribute to the mechanisms underlying apoptotic cell death occurring in aids-dementia complex  <cit> . it is known that enhanced oxidative stress, which occurs in brain tissues of patients undergoing hiv infection and is implicated in apoptotic cell death of both astroglia and neurones, may play a role in the pathogenesis of neuroaids and it is also known that hiv-1-infected patients are under chronic oxidative stress  <cit> . evidence exists that hiv infection is accompanied by simultaneous activation of free radical species in cns cells other then superoxide anions, such as nitric oxide   <cit> . apoptotic death of astrocytes could indirectly contribute to brain atrophy  <cit> . the design of this study was based on the crucial importance of oxidative stress induced by hiv- <dig> infection on the astrocytic damage. in particular, the aim of our research was to investigate the pathophysiological role of oxidative/inflammatory processes consequent to hiv- <dig> infection, in the development of apoptosis in the human astrocytic cell line u <dig>  on the other hand, with the aim to correlate hiv-related apoptotic cell death with telomere dysfunction, we evaluated the telomere length changes and telomerase activity occurring in u <dig> exposed to hiv and undergoing oxidative stress subsequent to hiv-related inflammatory processes. in addition, the hiv-related generation of oxidative stress, has been correlated with the changes occurring on gsh/gssh levels, involved in the regulation of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione. gsh is the major thiol present in the brain tissue and the most important redox buffer in the cells  <cit> . this antioxidant molecule cycles between gsh and gssg, and serves as a vital sink for control of ros levels in cells. in our experiments we observed that hiv induced apoptosis is strictly related to changes occurring in gsh/gssg ratio and gsh decrease suggesting the crucial role of oxidative stress in hiv related cellular damage. the presence of the antioxidant nac was able to reduce the apoptosis occurring in astrocytoma cell line after  <dig> and  <dig> days of hiv virus exposure . this reduction of apoptosis can be considered more high if we take in account that the percentage of apoptosis in the mock-infected and nac-untreated u <dig> at day  <dig> is around 17%. a confirming experiment of apoptosis was done by using the electron microscopy  and confirmed the results obtained with cytofluorimetric analysis. to observe if the astrocytic apoptosis is correlated to nuclear damage we analyzed the telomere shortening by q-fish staining. the telomere length in hiv-exposed samples was significantly shorter compared to control in keeping with the increase of apoptotic cells at the same time points, indicating a possible role of telomeres in the cellular surviving. nac treatment shows a protective effect on hiv induced telomere shortening by inhibiting the oxidative stress-induced damage and restoring the gsh/gssg ratio . a statistically significant telomere lengthening was revealed at day  <dig> in nac treated but not hiv- <dig> exposed cells, compared to negative control; this interesting telomere lengthening is probably due to the activity of the drug against an endogen oxidative intracellular status. it is in fact known that malignant cells produce height levels of oxidative stress to suppress apoptosis, accelerate proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis  <cit> . for this reason in our cellular model we already have a basal level of oxidative compounds that can be removed by the nac alone .

high levels of telomerase activity have been demonstrated in immortalized cell lines  <cit>  and in majority of human cancers  <cit>  in which these cells that constitutively express telomerase can continue to divide almost indefinitely  <cit> ; differently somatic cells, do not express telomerase, and their replicative potential are limited by progressive telomere shortening.

as expected, u <dig> cell line express telomerase activity as usually observed in tumor cell lines. moreover, our results interestingly showed no statistically significant telomerase modulation in hiv and nac+hiv- treated u <dig> cells  compared to the control, as observed by trap assay, despite telomere length modulation observed. this data could suggest two possible explanations for telomere lengthening observed in nac pre-treated samples: the involvement of a telomerase-independent mechanism, the alt pathway   <cit> . in fact, it is well known that, consistent with the requirement for telomere maintenance as a step in carcinogenesis, 80–90% of human tumor possess telomerase activity and the remainder maintains telomeres via alt, a recombination-mediated process  <cit> . on the other hand, this data could suggest that nac is able to prevent the telomere shortening not by inducing the telomere lengthening, but most likely inhibiting the oxidative stress and restoring the cellular homeostasis as shown by the analysis of the levels of gsh and gssg  in hiv- <dig> exposed u <dig> and in nac treated hiv- <dig> exposed u <dig>  it is known that hiv infection is associated with decreases in the gsh content  <cit> . this decreased gsh content may reduce the survival of hiv-infected patients  <cit>  perhaps by contributing to several disorders, such as cd4+ t cell apoptosis  <cit> , neuroaids  <cit>  and enhancing hiv replication. the figure  <dig> shows that the levels of gsh in u <dig> exposed to hiv- <dig> iiib decreased compared to control; nac treatment reversed this decrease and gsh returned to control levels. moreover, as we can see in the table  <dig>  the gsh/gssg ratio at the days  <dig> , <dig>  in hiv- <dig> exposed u <dig> decreased compared to negative control of not hiv- <dig> exposed cells; at the same time points, the gsh/gssg ratio significantly increased with nac treatment. nac-treatment of u <dig> hiv- <dig> exposed is able to restore the gsh levels, one of the major endogenous antioxidant molecule present in high levels in the cells. several authors have suggested that low gsh levels were a consequence of decreased levels of plasma cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for gsh synthesis  <cit> . for this reason the presence of nac, a cysteine donor involved in the synthesis of gsh, underlining that nac can be a potential pro-gsh compound acting as part of the glutathione  redox system.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrated that, as shown in human fibroblast  <cit> , in human astrocytic cell line u <dig>  the increase of oxidative stress, consequent to hiv- <dig> exposure, is responsible of acceleration of telomere shortening "in vitro". so, we can suppose that the telomeres could represent a key sensor of cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress following hiv- <dig> exposure. these observations can be an important starting point for future experiments. in addition, we demonstrated the protective action of antioxidant compound in reducing the hiv- <dig> iiib-mediated cellular damage.
