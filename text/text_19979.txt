BACKGROUND
the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  constitute a large superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins widely distributed in different life forms including prokaryotes , lower eukaryotes , and higher eukaryotes . p450s play an important role in the metabolism of a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. the current p <dig> nomenclature  <cit>  is based on divergent evolution of the p <dig> superfamily. on the basis of sequence homology, all p450s can be categorized into two main classes, b  and e   <cit> . bacterial p450s with three component systems  and the fungal p450nor   <cit>  belong to the 'b'-class. all the other known p450s from distinct systems, including eukaryotic p450s and bacterial p450s such as p450bm <dig>  from bacillus megaterium  <cit> , belong to the 'e'-class. the eukaryotic microsomal p <dig> system contains two components, the nadph:p <dig> oxidoreductase , a flavoprotein containing both fad and fmn, and the p <dig> monooxygenase containing the heme domain. the prokaryotic  soluble p <dig> monooxygenase p450bm <dig>  exists as a single protein with both heme and flavin functional domains. typically, the bacterial p450s are soluble and shorter  in length, whereas the eukaryotic p450s average around 500– <dig> amino acids or larger and are membrane-bound. the amino acid  sequence of these p <dig> monooxygenase proteins is extremely diverse, with levels of identity as low as 16% in some cases, but their structural fold has remained the same throughout evolution. the existing data suggest that divergence of the p <dig> superfamily into b and e classes, and further divergence into stable p <dig> groups within the e class, is very ancient and had occurred before the appearance of eukaryotes  <cit> . from the phylogenetic classification point of view, families have been identified based primarily on amino acid sequence similarity, with less than 40% similarity defining a family and 40–55% similarity defining a sub-family. recently, the concept of "clan" which represents higher order grouping of p <dig> families is gaining wider acceptance in the p <dig> community  <cit> .

among the different phyla, plants have the highest number of p <dig> sequences, followed by fungi. so far, more than  <dig> fungal p450s have been identified and the number is increasing with the sequencing of new fungal genomes . in comparison to the yeast forms , the higher order fungi have a larger number of p <dig> sequences in their genomes, with  <dig> p <dig> genes predicted in neurospora crassa ,  <dig> in aspergillus spp .,  <dig> in magnaporthe grisea ,  <dig> in fusarium graminearum and about  <dig> in phanerochaete chrysosporium. assuming the possibility that the present day p450s have evolved from a single ancestor p <dig> gene, the large disparity in the p <dig> gene count among the different phyla and genera is reflective of the differences in metabolic demand. according to nelson  <cit> , while plants have invested heavily on biochemistry for development of survival strategies thereby driving the p450s to expand rapidly, animals have invested on development of higher order sensory systems and hence carry comparatively fewer p450s. fungi, which resemble plants in their sedentary habitat, appear to have driven p450s to diversify rapidly.

phanerochaete chrysosporium , the model white rot fungus, has the extraordinary ability to degrade and mineralize  lignin, the earth's most abundant aromatic polymer, and a wide range of toxic chemical pollutants. lignin biodegradation occurs under nutrient-limited conditions when the fungus enters secondary metabolism. only white rot fungi are known to possess the ability to completely degrade lignin  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . the working hypothesis is that initial depolymerization of the lignin by extracellular peroxidases releases chemical compounds that are internalized and further degraded by diverse intracellular enzymes, including p <dig> monooxygenases. further, several studies have shown that this fungus can degrade and mineralize a broad spectrum of aromatic, alicyclic, and aliphatic chemical pollutants under both nutrient-limited  and nutrient-sufficient  conditions. lately, p <dig> monooxygenases have been shown to be involved in several of these biotransformations and this has led to an increasing interest in the characterization of cytochrome p <dig> systems in this model white rot fungus.

initial cloning efforts from this laboratory identified the first complete p <dig> system genes in p. chrysosporium. these efforts led to the isolation  <cit>  and functional characterization  <cit>  of three full-length p <dig> genes pc- <dig>  pc- <dig> and pc- <dig> that were assigned to cyp <dig> family, and the p <dig> oxidoreductase gene  that is responsible for electron transfer to the multiple p <dig> monooxygenases  <cit> . subsequent whole genome sequencing by the joint genome institute  of the us department of energy  has led to the identification of a large p <dig> contingent  in p. chrysosporium  <cit> . the p <dig> genes constitute nearly 1% of the coding sequences in the genome of this basidiomycetous fungus  <cit> . of the nearly  <dig> p <dig> monooxygenase genes identified in p. chrysosporium genome,  <dig> have been assembled full-length and tentatively annotated based on general overall sequence homology analysis  <cit> . to date, this is the highest number of p450s identified in any fungus, which appears to be one of the major underlying factors for its extraordinary catalytic potential. understanding the structural and evolutionary aspects of such large family of p450s in conjunction with their physiological characteristics will help understand the functional versatility of this fungus. this study reports a detailed genome-wide structural and phylogenetic analysis of the p450ome of p. chrysosporium , coupled with cloning and characterization of new cdnas for selected multigene p <dig> families, with a broader aim to facilitate the classification/nomenclature and to understand the functional diversity and evolution of the p450s in this wood-rotting model white rot fungus.

RESULTS
i. structural analysis and characterization of p. chrysosporium p450ome
p450ome of p. chrysosporium
our phylogenetic analysis coupled with the standard sequence homology criterion for p <dig> nomenclature revealed that p. chrysosporium p450s fall into  <dig> families and  <dig> sub-families . this family and sub-family classification is based on the amino acid sequence similarity using the existing criteria of less than 40% similarity defining a family and less than 55% similarity defining a sub-family as followed by the international p <dig> nomenclature committee. earlier we had reported an initial phylogenetic grouping of  <dig> predicted p <dig> sequences  into  <dig> clusters based on overall general homology criterion  <cit> . here we report the phylogenetic grouping of  <dig> p <dig> genes in  <dig> families and  <dig> sub-families using the p <dig> family/sub-family homology-based criterion. to eliminate the possibility of bias in grouping, only full-length or near full-length p <dig> sequences with more than  <dig> aa residues were used for constructing the tree in this study. of the  <dig> families, the international p <dig> nomenclature committee so far has named only three families including the highly conserved families cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  and the newly designated p. chrysosporium family cyp <dig>  nevertheless, based on the < 40% homology criterion, nine other families, each with varying degree of similarity to the existing one or more p <dig> families, were identifiable and were arbitrarily designated as follows: cyp58/ <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp5031/ <dig>  cyp614/ <dig>  cyp617/cyp <dig>  as compared to the recently reported analysis  <cit> , we have added  <dig> p <dig> genes grouped as three new clusters in the tree. individual genes from these clusters, when compared to the p <dig> sequences available at the p <dig> blast server , showed highest similarity to the p <dig> families cyp617/ <dig>  cyp614/ <dig> and cyp5031/ <dig>  respectively. these three sets of cyp names thus represent the families newly added to our phylogenetic tree .

among the  <dig> p <dig> families, the cyp <dig> family has the highest number  of member genes, followed by cyp <dig> , cyp <dig> , cyp58/ <dig> , cyp <dig> , cyp <dig> , cyp614/ <dig> , cyp617/ <dig> , cyp5031/cyp <dig> , whereas p <dig> families cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> consist of only one member gene each.

the international nomenclature committee on cytochrome p450s has been annotating the new p <dig> sequences on the basis of the existing primary amino acid sequence similarity criteria. however, there have been instances where the 40% similarity rule in defining a family has been relaxed, such as in naming the mammalian cyp <dig> family  <cit> . simultaneously, the usage of cyp "clans" which are higher-order clusters of related families is gaining consensus  <cit> . in view of this, a clan-based classification of the p <dig> families in p. chrysosporium is presented and discussed in subsequent sections, with an aim to understand their evolution and functional significance.

cloning of new p <dig> cdnas
our initial studies on cloning of cdnas for the first cloned p <dig> gene pc- <dig>  <cit>  and the related gene pc- <dig>  <cit> , both belonging to cyp <dig> family, indicated a complex structural organization of p <dig> genes in p. chrysosporium. in an effort to further understand the structural organization of p <dig> genes in this system, the following additional cdna sequences for the other cyp <dig> genes were isolated in the present study: pc- <dig> , pc- <dig> , pc- <dig>  and pc- <dig> . the isolated cdna sequences  were then compared with the corresponding predicted coding sequences in the genome. this gene/cdna analysis helped understand the gene features of the first multigene p <dig> family  identified in this organism  <cit> . the analysis also helped identify an additional gene, pc- <dig>  groupable under this family. furthermore, we isolated a cdna sequence representing the c-terminus half  of one of the fused p450foxy-like genes, pc-foxy <dig>  the cloned cdna , that spans  <dig> bp of the corresponding genomic region, helped identify the structural features of the p450foxy gene family  of the p450ome.

gene features  of the p. chrysosporium p450s
i). cyp <dig> family
the cloned cyp <dig> cdna sequences revealed that the member genes carry 6– <dig> introns with conserved gt/ag splice junctions and encode  <dig> to  <dig> aa proteins. the deduced proteins contain transmembrane domains in their n-terminus region centered around 21– <dig> aa residues with a matrix score of more than  <dig> as determined by tmpred analysis, indicating that these proteins are membrane bound. the seven cyp <dig> members  are groupable into three sub-families, cyp63a , cyp63b , and cyp63c . the three cyp63a member genes pc- <dig> , pc- <dig>  and pc- <dig>  are tandemly linked in that order with  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp intergenic regions. their intron organization  and the number of amino acids encoded are nearly the same , suggesting that the three genes are paralogous genes and originated by tandem duplication. the typical p <dig> motifs including heme-binding region , helix-i, and helix-k showed high sequence conservation among the seven cyp <dig> member proteins .

ii). p450foxy gene family 
the p. chrysosporium whole genome sequence revealed seven fused oxidoreductase-p <dig> proteins , of which  <dig> are located on a  <dig> kb stretch of the genome scaffold  <dig>  the process of deducing the amino acid sequences for these genes was guided in part by the pc-foxy <dig> cdna cloned in this study, in conjunction with the gene characteristics of the known p450foxy sequence of fusarium oxysporum  <cit> , and the earlier reported p <dig> splicing pattern in p. chrysosporium  <cit> . analysis of the p450foxy genes revealed  <dig> to  <dig> introns, of which  <dig> are conserved in all the seven member genes . the cloned pc-foxy <dig> cdna fragment  contained splicing site for a single type-ii intron  with defined gt/ag splice junction. the reductase portion of the cloned pc-foxy <dig> cdna contained two fad and three nadph functional domains and showed deduced aa homology to the distal region of the p <dig> oxidoreductase  protein of this organism. the full-length  functional por earlier reported for p. chrysosporium has multiple domains, including  <dig> fmn,  <dig> fad and  <dig> nadph domains  <cit> . however, except for the proximal fad domain, the degree of motif conservation was poor between the two reductase sequences , suggesting that the reductase component of the p450foxy fusion genes has an independent descent and is not duplicated from the native por gene.

the five p450foxy member genes on genome scaffold  <dig> show divergent transcription, with the three member genes  transcribing from the same strand, whereas the other two genes  transcribing from the opposite strand of dna. the deduced p450foxy proteins containing 624– <dig> amino acid residues show high aa similarity  among them and hence can be classified under the same sub-family. the general domain architecture of these proteins is the same as that of the earlier reported p450foxy protein from f. oxysporum  <cit> , with an n-terminal p <dig> segment and a c-terminal reductase segment. all seven proteins have a full-length p <dig> segment with conserved p <dig> signature sequences. however, the reductase segment is full-length in only  <dig> of the seven members and is truncated in the member gene gx. <dig> . <dig>  these six member proteins contain a transmembrane domain, centered around 908– <dig> aa positions with a matrix score of more than  <dig>  as detected by tmpred analysis. the truncated member contains a transmembrane domain centered on amino acid residue  <dig>  the above analysis points to the membrane-bound nature of these fused proteins similar to the homologous f. oxysporum protein and consistent with the membrane-bound nature of most of the eukaryotic p <dig> and por proteins.

it is unusual that p. chrysosporium has only one p <dig> oxidoreductase  gene to cater to such a large contingent of p <dig> monooxygenases for the electron supply, with the exception of p450foxy proteins . this suggests a more significant role of alternate electron transfer proteins such as cytochromes b <dig> and b <dig> reductase in this organism; it will, however, require further functional characterization to prove this assumption. the p450foxy proteins appear to be self sufficient in their electron transfer mechanism considering the presence of a complete reductase partner  as a part of the fusion protein. such electron transfer function of the reductase component was experimentally demonstrated in the first known p450foxy fusion protein of the ascomycete fungus fusarium oxysporum  <cit> .

iii). gene features of other p450ome genes
among the other p <dig> families in the p450ome, the cyp <dig> family has the most genes , with member genes carrying 5– <dig> introns of size 21– <dig> bp, and encoding 350– <dig> aa size proteins. detailed gene features of the other individual p <dig> families of the p. chrysosporium p450ome are listed in table  <dig> 

typically, all the full-length assembled p <dig> genes were found to carry multiple exons frequently interrupted by small introns. in this analysis, we observed a relatively narrow size range for introns  as compared to the exons; the shortest exon is  <dig> bp  and the longest is  <dig> bp . nearly half of the p <dig> genes show small exons , with  <dig> genes carrying  <dig> bp or shorter exons . interestingly, the p450ome genes contain microexons  that are spread genome-wide and are not restricted to any particular p <dig> family. such ubiquitous occurrence of the microexons in p. chrysosporium p <dig> genes points to their potential role in conferring functional diversity and emphasizes the fact that the functional divergence is not merely a product of gene duplication/translocation. in comparison to the p <dig> genes, the intron size range in the most intensively characterized peroxidase gene family of this organism is 49– <dig> bp, with  <dig> to  <dig> bp for the lignin peroxidase  sub-family and  <dig> to  <dig> bp for the manganese-dependent peroxidase  sub-family. furthermore, as revealed by the whole genome sequencing, the presence of relatively small introns  appears typical of this genome as compared to the higher eukaryotic genomes  <cit> .

p <dig> gene clustering and tandem genes
the p. chrysosporium genome shows a total of  <dig> p <dig> gene clusters, with up to  <dig> member genes in a cluster. of the  <dig> clusters, three clusters are located on scaffold  <dig>  two each on scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and one each on scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for convenience, the clusters have been assigned numbers  <dig> through  <dig> in the order they appear on the individual genomic scaffolds. among these, cluster- <dig> has the highest number of tandem genes  followed by cluster- <dig>  and cluster- <dig>  . the earlier cloned tandem cyp <dig> genes pc- <dig>  pc- <dig> and pc- <dig> represent cluster- <dig> 

there is a high sequence similarity  among the members of a given cluster and the cluster members fall under the same p <dig> family on the phylogenetic tree . the number of introns and exons and their relative positions in the member genes of a cluster are conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> clusters . two distinct patterns exist for the intron organization  within each cluster. in the case of small gene clusters , the number and relative position of introns as well as the size of the exons are conserved among the members, whereas the larger gene clusters  show varying degrees of dissimilarity in these characteristics. while the conserved gene characteristics suggest more recent duplications, the dissimilarity suggests either more distant duplication events or translocation events. therefore, the p. chrysosporium genome shows both homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters of tandem genes. tandem duplicates , which initially are structurally and functionally identical, diverge with time due to mutations or translocations. it is plausible that one copy retains the original function, while the second copy either acquires a new function that is selected to meet the increased metabolic demand or gets deleted from the genome. in this context, it is noteworthy that member genes of cluster- <dig> , though closely spaced and structurally highly homogeneous, showed non-coordinate regulation of transcription and varying substrate inducibility  <cit> . while such substrate diversity among the members of tandemly linked p <dig> genes has been observed in the yeast candida maltosa  <cit> , this observation is new in the context of filamentous fungi.

analysis of spatial organization of the p <dig> gene clusters in the p. chrysosporium genome revealed a variable pattern. for instance, the two p <dig> clusters on scaffold- <dig> are spread over a  <dig> kb genomic region separated by more than  <dig> kb, whereas the gene clusters on other scaffolds are more closely spaced. on scaffold- <dig>  the clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are spread over a  <dig> kb of genomic region and are separated by less than  <dig> kb genomic region. similarly, clusters  <dig> to  <dig> on scaffold- <dig> are spread over an  <dig> kb region with a 27– <dig> kb gap between them. the two clusters on scaffold- <dig> are separated by less than  <dig> kb dna and are spread over a  <dig> kb genomic region. this analysis constitutes the first report on p <dig> clustering and spatial organization in filamentous fungi. nevertheless, in fungi, it has been frequently observed that the genes coding for enzymes involved in secondary metabolism, such as those involved in the synthesis of ergot alkaloids  <cit> , hc-toxin  <cit> , and mycotoxins such as sterigmatocystin and aflatoxins  <cit> , are heterologous clusters . clustering of secondary metabolic genes has been proposed to favor their survival and dispersal, at least in part, via horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . the close association seen in some of the p. chrysosporium gene clusters might point to their co-ordinated regulation as observed in the case of the above secondary metabolic gene clusters in different fungi. however, experimental evidence is needed to extrapolate this assumption to the fungal p <dig> clusters. our initial transcription-based analysis demonstrated lack of such co-ordinated regulation among the tandem cyp <dig> genes of cluster- <dig> in p. chrysosporium  <cit> .

alternative splicing and functional diversity
alternative splicing is an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression, which expands the coding capacity of a single gene to allow production of different protein isoforms, often with diverse functions  <cit> . more than 50% of human genes are alternatively spliced  <cit> . reports in fungi on alternative splicing are few  <cit> , in comparison to humans where this mechanism has been well documented. we have experimentally identified two splice variants of the first characterized p <dig> gene pc- <dig>  from p. chrysosporium  <cit>  and predicted more such variants based on the in silico analysis. although splice variants have not been identified so far in the other two tandemly arranged members pc- <dig> and pc- <dig> of this cluster, their similar gene organization  suggests the existence of splice variants. further, while validating our custom 70-mer microarray analysis data  <cit>  on p <dig> gene transcription and induction using rt-pcr , we observed that the transcript quantification for a given sample in some cases varied with the location of the primer chosen . this observed variation points to the existence of alternative splice variants. a recently proposed system of nomenclature for such splice variants suggests that the transcript name should include the exon involved in the splicing event  <cit> . it is noteworthy that nearly one-third of the p. chrysosporium p450ome shows microexons, which are likely candidates that promote alternative splicing events during transcription. such alternative splicing helps increase the diversity of the transcriptome, and is likely to significantly contribute to the metabolic diversity of this organism.

ii. evolutionary analysis of p. chrysosporium p450ome
fungal p <dig> clans in p. chrysosporium
finding meaningful associations and evolutionary relationships among members of the rapidly expanding superfamily of the p <dig> proteins at the species level is becoming a challenge using the existing family level classification. for instance, the cyp <dig> family that is exclusive to insects forms a close cluster with the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families from mammals, cyp <dig> from clams, and cyp <dig> from c. elegans on the phylogenetic tree, indicating that these five families probably have evolved from a common ancestor with similar function before the deuterostome-protostome split  <cit> . however, this is not reflected in the family names, as the family classification is based on an arbitrary 40% amino acid similarity criterion. to explain such higher order groupings, the term "clan" was recently introduced  <cit> . typically, a clan represents a cluster of p <dig> families across species, grouped based on relationships that are beyond the family designations. there are  <dig> clans in vertebrates and  <dig> in plants.

a detailed phylogenetic analysis was carried out to understand the evolutionary relationship of p. chrysosporium p <dig> gene families and their relatedness with other fungal clans. in lower forms of fungi ,  <dig> p <dig> families  have been characterized, of which cyp <dig> and  <dig> are conserved. in higher forms of fungi ,  <dig> p <dig> families  are common as exemplified by the hitherto sequenced genomes of four ascomycetous fungal species: neurospora crassa , magnoporthe grisea , fusarium graminearum and aspergillus nidulans . interestingly, based on homology analysis, the p <dig> families cyp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are also present in p. chrysosporium  albeit with a widely varying degree of similarity. further, clan level comparisons revealed that  <dig> p. chrysosporium p <dig> families  have resemblances in  <dig> fungal p <dig> clans and show varying degrees of structural similarities to the p <dig> genes from different ascomycetous fungi such as aspergillus and fusarium , suggesting that p. chrysosporium has acquired these p <dig> families as a part of vertical descent from a common ancestor followed by further diversification. it will be interesting to compare the hitherto uncharacterized zygomycetous p450ome to arrive at the ancestral p450ome that led to the current p <dig> diversity among these three major fungal groups .

cyp <dig> clan
one of the highly conserved and functionally well-characterized p <dig> gene families in fungi is the cyp <dig> family that encodes the cell wall ergosterol biosynthesis reaction, lanosterol 14-alpha demethylation in yeasts or eburicol 14-alpha demethylation in filamentous fungi, a target step for antifungal azole compounds. the current state of knowledge on p <dig> evolution in eukaryotes points to cyp <dig> as the ancestral p <dig>  which is believed to have led to the evolution of all the present day p <dig> families  <cit> . in comparison to some of the ascomycetous fungi, which carry multiple cyp <dig> genes, there is a single cyp <dig> gene  in p. chrysosproium that codes for a  <dig> aa protein. the cyp <dig> minimal evolution tree, based on the available cyp51s from  <dig> fungal species , depicts that basidiomycete cyp51s  form the closest association with cyp51s from the ascomycetous fungi as compared to those from the zygomycetous fungus cunninghamella elegans and the hemi-ascomycetous fungus . considering the fact that all known fungi except ascomycetes have a single cyp <dig> gene in their genome , it appears that the ascomycetous fungi required diversification of their cyp <dig> gene. this intragenome diversification of cyp <dig> in ascomycetes, such as in the genomes of a. nidulans , m. grisea , and f. graminearum , is reflected by high bootstrap values separating their multiple cyp51s. likewise, analysis of the recently completed plant genomes has shown that the rice genome contains ten functional cyp <dig> genes and two pseudogenes  <cit> , and that arabidopsis has two cyp <dig> genes, in contrast to the popular belief that a single cyp <dig> gene exists in all phyla. the presence of multiple cyp51s might indicate their involvement beyond the sterol biosynthesis to take up new function for the organism's survival. since the ascomycete species that carry multiple cyp51s are parasitic in nature, multiple cyp51s/variants might have been acquired to give these species an edge in host-pathogen interaction or survival against antifungal treatment  <cit> , unlike in saprophytic fungi such as p. chrysosporium.

cyp  <dig> clan
cyp <dig> codes for sterol  <dig> desaturase in saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is involved in later stages of the ergosterol pathway in metabolizing ergosta- <dig> ,24-trienol to ergosta- <dig> , <dig> -tetraenol by introducing a c- <dig> double bond in the sterol side chain  <cit> . since this gene acts late in the ergosterol pathway, it is considered to have evolved as a result of duplication and diversification of the cyp <dig> gene  <cit> . the p. chrysosporium genome contains one cyp <dig> gene. however, unlike its cyp <dig> , cyp <dig> of p. chrysosporium is phylogenetically as distant from euascomycetous cyp61s as it is from the hemi-ascomycetous cyp <dig> . these analyses also show diversification of cyp <dig> within the ascomycetous group at least in  <dig> subclusters  that coincide with small genomes  versus larger genomes .

cyp <dig> clan
the cyp <dig> family of p <dig> proteins was originally identified in candida species  <cit>  with a role in carrying out terminal hydroxylation of n-alkanes and ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids. the varying substrate specificities of these genes have given this yeast its ability to modify a range of n-alkanes. later, homologous genes have been identified in other yeasts  <cit>  and filamentous fungal species . the earlier discussed cyp <dig> family of p. chrysosporium, which consists of seven members, pc- <dig> through pc- <dig>  shows close architectural resemblance to the cyp <dig> family of yeasts and thus can be classified under the same clan. however, as evident from the minimal evolution tree , the white rot cyp <dig> members form a separate cluster on the tree from the cyp <dig> family members of the ascomycetous fungi and other cyp52-related fungal p <dig> families. furthermore, despite high structural similarity among them, the individual member genes of the cyp <dig> cluster are separated by high bootstrap values, indicating significant divergence among them. this is corroborated by our experimental studies on substrate inducibility of the three tandemly linked cyp <dig> members pc- <dig>  pc- <dig>  and pc-3; the expression of these linked p450s was differentially induced  in response to linear alkanes and substituted alkanes. moreover, their substrate-specificity seems to extend beyond alkanes/substituted alkanes as they also showed induction in the presence of various aromatics, including the polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pahs  <cit> . these and other experimentally generated data on their differential physiological regulation  <cit>  coupled with the presented phylogenetic analysis point to the evolution of the cyp <dig> family to acquire diverse functional roles while retaining its original alkane-degrading ability. while the n-alkanes are hydroxylated for assimilation  by candida species, the p <dig> hydroxylation of alkanes by p. chrysosporium  appears to be a co-metabolic activity required for catalyzing aliphatic oxidations during the natural lignin degradation process. this is further supported by the fact that there are structural resemblances between the inducer compounds  and the substructures present in its natural substrate lignin.

cyp <dig> clan
the cyp <dig> family, first identified in aspergillus spp., was shown to include p <dig> proteins that catalyze various reactions involved in biosynthesis of aflatoxins and other such secondary metabolites in these species  <cit> . genome-wide sequence similarity analysis and annotation of the p. chrysosporium p450ome revealed that  <dig> p <dig> genes fall under the cyp <dig> clan . the p. chrysosporium cyp <dig> family members are interspersed on the tree  constructed based on the cyp <dig> clan genes from other fungal groups suggesting their multiple lineage or diversification. white rot fungi such as p. chrysosporium , which have a typical secondary metabolic switch in their growth/ biodegradation cycle, may have the hitherto uncharacterized role for its cyp <dig> clan proteins in secondary metabolism. functional evaluation of one or more members from this group will bring into light the enzymatic or functional diversity of such a large number of cyp64-like genes in this fungus.

cyp <dig> clan
the fatty acid hydroxylase p450bm <dig>  of the bacterium bacillus megaterium , containing a p <dig> monooxygenase gene fused with a p <dig> reductase gene, was the first identified fusion protein member of the p <dig> superfamily  <cit> . later, a similar fused p <dig> gene coding for fatty acid hydroxylase was identified from the fungus fusarium oxysporum  <cit> . the latter, named p450foxy, shows  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid similarity in its p <dig> and reductase domains to the corresponding domains in the bacterial p <dig> fusion protein p450bm <dig>  the current hypothesis suggests that such fused proteins are of eukaryotic origin and their occurrence in the prokaryotic  cells is due to horizontal gene transfer  <cit> .

interestingly, there are 7-fused p450foxy-like genes in the p. chrysosporium genome located on  <dig> different scaffolds. these seven p450s form a separate cluster from the known p450foxy proteins of other fungi  on the minimal evolution tree . there are two distinct clusters among the ascomycetous fungi , which appear to be lineages of two ancestral fused proteins based on their phylogenetic distance; of these, one clusters more closely with the p. chrysosporium fusion proteins. the white rot fusion proteins form three sub-groups within their phylogenetic branch separated by reasonably high bootstrap values , indicating considerable divergence among these proteins. nevertheless, these fused proteins, while forming three sub-groups within their phylogenetic branch, show high conservation of functional domain sequences and intron/exon organization, suggesting the involvement of gene duplication and translocation events in their formation. there are multiple lines of evidence to support this argument. first, as discussed earlier, five out of the seven fused proteins are placed within a distance of  <dig> kb region on scaffold  <dig>  second, the conserved intron positioning in all agrees perfectly with their common grouping on the tree . third, multiple regions of high sequence similarity in the flanking regions around these genes have been identified using the blast program. for instance, when the  <dig> kb region of the scaffold  <dig> was blasted against itself, a near perfect inverse duplication region of  <dig> kb was identified; the region from base number  <dig> to  <dig> is identical to the regions spanning base numbers  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  this explains the awkward position of the pc. <dig> . <dig> gene between the closely related genes ug. <dig> . <dig> and pc. <dig> . <dig> on this scaffold and indicates a duplicative inversion event . similarly, there is high sequence similarity  between the  <dig> bp non-coding flanking region downstream of the gx. <dig> . <dig> gene, spanning base numbers  <dig> to  <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  and the  <dig> bp non-coding region upstream of gene pc. <dig> . <dig> spanning base numbers  <dig> to  <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  this points to an ectopic insertion of the gx. <dig> . <dig> on scaffold  <dig> after duplication on scaffold  <dig>  this finding of an extraordinary level of sequence identity for non-coding dna regions provides further evidence to the proposed involvement of gene duplication and translocation events.

many questions regarding the origin and distribution of these fused p <dig> proteins in fungi remain unanswered. one can conclude from the phylogenetic tree  that more than one original fusion event happened in the ancestral fungus either before the ascomycetous-basidiomycetous split approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , or a second fusion event happened in ascomycetous fungi immediately after these two groups split. either way, during the course of evolution, these proteins have diversified further, possibly due to more gene fusions or due to gene duplications . assuming that the ancestral fungus carried two fusion proteins, the question as to what happened to the other gene lineage in basidiomycetous fungi arises; has it been lost immediately after these two groups split without further diversification or was it never there and the second lineage in the ascomycetous fungi originated after these groups had separated? however, there is one complication to this argument; if p450foxy proteins predate the ascomycetous-basidiomycetous split, then why are these proteins missing entirely in archiascomycotina and hemiascomycotina ? this is an open question and may be answered by analyzing the genomes of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas  or chitrids, which predate these two groups' split  <cit> . the third possible reason for occurrence of these fused proteins in p. chrysosporium could be horizontal gene transfer from one or more of the ascomycetous fungi. when the p. chrysosporium p450foxy proteins were compared to the recently completed whole genome shotgun sequences of other basidiomycetes coprinus cinereus , cryptococcus neoformans , and ustilago maydis , no p <dig> fused protein homologues were found indicating the unique presence of these proteins in p. chrysosporium, a member of the wood-rooting group of basidiomycetes. however, as more fungal genomes become available, especially from the basidiomycetous group, it will be clear if these fusion proteins are actually unique in p. chrysosporium  among basidiomycetous fungi. nevertheless, it appears that fused proteins are predominantly present across ascomycetous fungi, and their presumed exceptional occurrence in the basidiomycete p. chrysosporium could possibly be a result of a horizontal gene transfer, an event otherwise rare in fungal genome evolution  <cit> . looking at the gene organization and flanking sequence homology of these p <dig> genes in p. chrysosporium in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  and their distribution on the genome, it appears that six of the seven genes have branched out from a single progenitor gene, while the origin of the seventh gene pc. <dig> . <dig> remains unclear and could possibly be a result of independent transfer. role of intragenomic duplication event in the origin of pc. <dig> . <dig> is ruled out based on the fact that there is no flanking sequence similarity between this and the other six genes. furthermore, p. chrysosporium has the largest contingent  of p450foxy proteins  among the fungi  containing this family of proteins. these observations collectively point to a rapid evolution of this p <dig> fusion proteins family  in p. chrysosporium, possibly to meet the metabolic demand for fatty acid hydroxylation in the ecological niches of this fungus.

clan-level relationships of other p. chrysosporium p <dig> families
the p. chrysosporium genome contains one member of the benzoate 4-hydroxylase family  and nine members homologous to cyp <dig>  both clustering under a common family on the p. chrysosporium tree  and groupable into the cyp <dig> clan . presence of a single cyp <dig> protein in p. chrysosporium contrasts with the multiple cyp <dig> proteins detected in ascomycetous fungi. a total of  <dig> sequences  that are groupable into  <dig> sub-classes  have been assigned to the cyp <dig> clan in different ascomycetous fungi . the p. chrysosporium cyp <dig> protein is groupable under the b sub-class. the cyp <dig> family proteins have been shown to be involved in the synthesis of a group of secondary metabolites  in fusarium spp.  <cit> . these proteins are grouped under the cyp <dig> clan sub-class c. however, the p. chrysosporium cyp <dig> homologues form a cluster separate from other fungal cyp <dig> proteins on the minimal evolution tree . hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that these cyp <dig> structural homologues have evolved as functional variants, acquiring both cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> activities.

phylogenetic analysis based on the fungal cyp <dig> clan revealed that  <dig> of the p. chrysosporium p <dig> genes show close relatedness to the cyp512a <dig> gene from another lignin-degrading basidiomycete, coriolus versicolor , but are distant from the cyp <dig> family and other cyp <dig> clan proteins from ascomycetous fungi, as shown by a high bootstrap value of 96% . the cyp <dig> family of p <dig> proteins originally found in gibberella fujikuroi encode for multifunctional ent -kaurene oxidases that catalyze oxidation steps in the gibberellin biosynthesis of the plant growth hormone gibberellin, a secondary metabolite in this fungus. this is suggestive of a possible role of p. chrysosporium cyp <dig> clan genes in secondary metabolism.

sixteen p. chrysosporium p <dig> genes relate to the cyp <dig> clan . the cyp <dig> family was originally constituted of plant-induced rust genes identified in the basidiomycetous fungus uromyces fabae  <cit> . the diterpene aphidicolin synthesizing gene pbp450- <dig> from phoma betae and the genes involved in sterigmatocystin biosynthesis in emericella nidulans are also groupable in the same clan in addition to some p450s encoding secondary metabolic reactions in other ascomycetous fungi . this suggests that the sixteen p. chrysosporium homologues might as well be involved in similar reaction steps in the synthesis of its secondary metabolites.

two p. chrysosporium p <dig> families, cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  are groupable under the cyp <dig> clan. while the cyp <dig> clan proteins occur in all the higher ascomycetous fungi studied so far, two such proteins  have also been identified recently in the basidiomycetous fungus u. maydis , of which cyp5031a <dig> shows closest relatedness  to the two p. chrysosporium p <dig> proteins . on the other hand, the six other p. chrysosporium p <dig> proteins , while showing highest blast homology to the cyp <dig> family of proteins, form a distinct group on the phylogenetic tree with a bootstrap value of 79% . it is possible that these six genes represent a unique family of p <dig> proteins, hitherto unidentified in other fungi. the same is true in the case of seven genes from the cyp614/ <dig> clan and one gene  from the cyp <dig> family of p. chrysosporium , which form independent clusters on the phylogenetic tree .

based on the clan-level comparison, it is evident that, although the p. chrysosporium p450ome has member counterparts among different fungal groups, in most cases, their independent clustering suggests significant sequence diversification and likely unique functionality. such diversification emphasizes the need for assigning new family names to the p. chrysosporium p450s.

CONCLUSIONS
the recognized extraordinary catalytic diversity of the white rot fungus p. chrysosporium correlates with its enormous p <dig> repertoire , which is one of the largest among lower eukaryotes. our structural and phylogenetic analyses of the p450ome, meant to understand the genesis of such a large number of p <dig> genes and facilitate their classification/nomenclature, have provided important clues to the evolution of the enormous catalytic diversity in this fungus. considering the fact that certain p <dig> families  have diversified more extensively than others, it appears that the p. chrysosporium p450ome has evolved in specific directions to meet the metabolic demand in its environmental niches. while the ancestral genes like cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> have remained unchanged, possibly due to their minimal role in p. chrysosporium  versus that in their parasitic cousins such as pathogenic aspergilli, other p <dig> gene families with suggestive roles in secondary metabolism  have evolved as multigene families and even exist as gene clusters in this fungus. such family-specific evolution was warranted presumably due to an extensive demand for generation of a broad range of metabolites in the secondary metabolic switch required for degradation of complex natural substrates such as lignin. the presented analysis indicates that the progenitor p <dig> families, originally acquired as a part of vertically descending p450ome, have diversified rapidly via multiple genetic mechanisms such as tandem duplications, translocations, mutations, and possibly gene fusions, to give rise to majority of the multigene families in the p. chrysosporium p450ome. consequently, this structural diversification within individual multigene p <dig> families, as experimentally demonstrated in the case of cyp <dig> family in our studies, seems to have led to the acquisition of novel functions hitherto unseen in their ancestral counterparts . in addition, our experimental evidence for the presence of alternatively spliced variants in the p. chrysosporium p <dig> transcriptome further explains the evolution of expanded substrate diversity in this organism. the p. chrysosporium p450ome forms a model to investigate extrapolation of the evolved p <dig> gene diversity to the known vast biodegradation potential and will help design the future functional studies to understand the individual p <dig> gene functions in order to dissect the p <dig> functional diversity in white rot fungi.
