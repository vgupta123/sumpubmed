BACKGROUND
apolipoprotein b  is the principal structural apolipoprotein in the ldl, vldl, idl, lp and chylomicron lipoprotein particles  <cit> . the apob pre-mrna comprises  <dig> exons, all constitutively spliced into the mature mrna. there exist two natural protein isoforms, the full-length apob <dig> and the c-terminal truncation apob <dig>  apob <dig> is synthesized in the liver, and this isoform is required for the assembly of vldl, idl, ldl, and lp. along with apoe, apob <dig> is the ligand for the ldl receptor. excess levels of the apob100-containing particles ldl and lp have been implicated in atherogenesis  <cit> . apob <dig> is generated by tissue-specific rna editing of a caa codon to a premature uaa termination codon in the intestine, and is identical to the n-terminal 48% of apob <dig>  editing is performed by a protein complex known as the editosome, which consists of the catalytic subunit apobec- <dig> and accessory factors. the rna editing site and mooring sequence necessary for editosome binding and function are within exon  <dig>  the apob <dig> isoform is required for chylomicron assembly and intestinal fat transport. as the apob <dig> isoform lacks the c-terminal domain necessary for ldl receptor binding, chylomicrons are unable to bind via this receptor, and are cleared by interaction of apoe with the chylomicron remnant receptor  <cit> .

because of its central role in atherosclerosis, apob has become a major therapeutic target. down-regulation of apob <dig> expression would be expected to decrease vldl, idl, ldl and lp levels, and therefore prevent the development of atherosclerosis. over-expression of the rabbit apobec- <dig> enzyme in transgenic mouse livers has been shown to cause increased rna editing, isoform switching from apob <dig> to apob <dig>  and lowered ldl levels  <cit> . other approaches have concentrated on the down-regulation of apob mrna levels, for example by chimeric antisense-oligonucleotide mediated rnase h degradation  <cit> , and by rna interference  <cit> .

we hypothesized that modifying apob splicing would cause the expression of an alternative isoform of apob. we selected exon  <dig> as our target for three reasons. firstly, translation of the apob mrna lacking exon  <dig>  would generate a c-terminally truncated isoform of apob, apob87skip <dig>  which is similar to the c-terminal truncations seen in some patients with hypobetalipoproteinemia. heterozygotes for these mutant alleles of apob have lower cholesterol and ldl levels  <cit> . secondly, the 5' splice-site of exon  <dig>  when scored for its similarity to the splice-site consensus using the shapiro and senapathy position weight matrix, was the weakest of all the 5' splice-sites of the internal exons of apob at  <dig>   <cit> . we reasoned that as constitutive 5' splice-sites in general score better than alternatively spliced 5' splice-sites  <cit> , apob exon  <dig> would be the most amenable to alternative splicing. thirdly, as the sequences necessary for rna editing are present in exon  <dig>  the skip  <dig> mrna should be edited as usual in the intestine, and apob <dig> expression should be unaffected.

we demonstrate in this paper that the induction of exon  <dig> skipping causes the expression and secretion of a truncated isoform of apob which is potentially of therapeutic utility in lowering ldl and cholesterol levels in vivo.

RESULTS
aso targeted to the splice-sites of apob exon  <dig> induce exon skipping
in order to modify exon  <dig> splicing, we used splice-site asos, which have previously been used to modify splicing in the dystrophin gene  <cit>  and to correct the aberrant alternative splicing in the ß-thalassemia mutation ivs2- <dig>  <cit> . 2'o-methyl rna asos were targeted to the 5' and 3' splice-sites of exon  <dig>  as well as the branch-point sequence  just adjacent to the 3' splice-site of intron 26– <dig>  to block their recognition by the spliceosome. the design of the asos is shown in fig.  <dig>  these asos were transfected into hepg <dig> cells, and total rna was extracted and analyzed by rt-pcr with primers complementary to regions within exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

as shown in fig.  <dig>  mock-transfected cells  showed no skipping of exon  <dig>  consistent with this being a constitutively-spliced exon. cells transfected with an unrelated aso directed against the firefly luciferase gene  did not show any skipping of exon  <dig>  surprisingly, the asos directed either to the 5' or to the 3' splice-site  did not have any effect on splicing. however, when both 5' and 3' splice-sites were targeted by the same aso , a shorter rt-pcr product was obtained. this effect was stronger if either skip 27- <dig> or skip 27- <dig> was linked to a sequence targeting the bps . cloning and sequencing confirmed that this shorter rt-pcr product consists of exon  <dig> sequence spliced to exon  <dig>  and therefore corresponds to the skip  <dig> mrna. an aso targeting the bps alone  was not effective in inducing skipping . moreover, a mixture of either skip 27- <dig> or skip 27- <dig> with skip 27-b did not induce skipping, indicating that these asos do not act synergistically .

we also tested asos tailed with an rna sequence designed to bind the inhibitory splicing factor hnrnp a <dig>  a strategy that was previously shown to increase the efficiency of alternative splicing in the bcl-x pre-mrna in vivo  <cit> . the fluc a <dig> aso, which bears the a <dig> tail, does not have any effect on exon  <dig> skipping, as noted above. linking the skip 27– <dig> aso with the a <dig> tail  appeared to decrease the skipping of exon  <dig> compared to skip 27– <dig> itself . mutation of the a <dig> tail such that it does not bind hnrnp a <dig>  restored its effects to some extent, suggesting that hnrnp a <dig> itself is interfering with the ability of the skip 27– <dig> aso to induce skipping.

fig.  <dig> shows that at concentrations ranging between 0– <dig> nm, the skip 27-3b aso was consistently the most effective at inducing exon  <dig> skipping. a scramble mutation of skip 27-3b, skip 27-3b scram, had no effect even at the highest concentration, indicating that the alternative splicing effect of the skip 27-3b aso is sequence-specific. fluorescence microscopy of cells transfected with 5' fluorescein-labelled skip 27-3b and skip 27-3b scram asos showed that both asos were transfected with equal efficiency into ~80% cells, indicating that differences in transfection efficiency were not responsible for the different effects seen . as before, tailing skip 27-3b with the a <dig> tail significantly reduced the efficiency of the aso, as noted before with the skip 27– <dig> aso. mutation of the a <dig> tail  restored the efficiency of skipping to levels not significantly different from skip 27-3b, again suggesting that hnrnp a <dig> specifically interferes with the ability of the skip 27-3b aso to induce skipping.

we conclude, therefore, that the 5' splice-site, the 3' splice-site, and the bps are crucial for the constitutive inclusion of exon  <dig>  asos targeting single splice-sites are not effective in inducing exon  <dig> skipping. instead, combination asos that target two splice-sites are effective at inducing exon  <dig> skipping, and an aso targeting both the 3' splice-site and the bps  appears to be the most effective in doing so. as mixing individual single splice-site asos, for example combining skip 27- <dig> with skip 27-b, was not effective in inducing exon  <dig> skipping, it is unlikely that these asos work by simple occupancy of splice-sites and competition with splicing factors. instead, we speculate that these asos might operate by inducing an alternative secondary structure in the apob mrna. an mfold analysis of the predicted conformation of exon  <dig> and its flanking intronic sequences  <cit>  shows that the targeted 3' splice-site and bps reside within relatively open structures . as the secondary structure of rna is known to influence splicing in some instances  <cit> , it is possible that binding of the skip 27-3b aso closes these open structures and discourages splice-site recognition by the spliceosome. consistent with this idea, hnrnp a <dig> is known to unwind nucleic acid secondary structure  <cit> , and this property may explain its paradoxical ability to restore exon  <dig> inclusion, perhaps by interfering with aso hybridization to the apob pre-mrna .

asos targeted to putative exonic splicing enhancer motifs within exon  <dig> weakly induce its skipping
exonic splicing enhancers  are sequences within exons that activate inclusion of the exon that harbors them, typically by binding sr proteins  <cit> . we reasoned that eses within exon  <dig> might contribute to the constitutive inclusion of this exon, and that exon  <dig> skipping might be induced by interfering with sr protein binding to these elements. we turned to computational tools in order to identify potential eses: esefinder  <cit> , rescue-ese  <cit> , and pesxs server  <cit> . based on these predictions, four asos targeting nucleotides 6– <dig>  31– <dig>  61– <dig> and 88– <dig> were tested .

fig. 4b shows that these asos induced skipping of exon  <dig>  but much less efficiently than the splice-site asos described above. furthermore, in order to test the idea that the exonic asos might synergize with each other, we transfected hepg <dig> cells with mixtures of the exonic asos. however, combinations of exonic aso pairs and mixtures of all four exonic asos, although demonstrating some additive effects, were inefficient at inducing exon  <dig> skipping: the maximum exon  <dig> skipping demonstrated with mixtures of all four exonic asos was 1–2% . we conclude, therefore, that the identified eses play a relatively small role in the inclusion of exon  <dig> during splicing.

asos targeting the splice-sites of apob exon  <dig> do not generally affect the splicing of other alternatively-spliced genes
because splice-sites conform to a degenerate consensus, there exists a possibility that the apob skip  <dig> splice-site asos might potentially bind to other pre-mrna splice-sites. we searched for matches to the exon  <dig> splice-sites in a comprehensive database of splice-sites, splicerack  <cit> , but did not identify any extra matches in the human database, indicating that this possibility is unlikely. in order to directly test the hypothesis that the splice-site asos might be non-specifically affecting alternative splicing, for example by binding splicing factors or by hybridizing to other pre-mrnas, we tried to detect changes in the well described alternative splicing of other exons such as tsc <dig> exon  <dig>  caspase- <dig> exons  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  and insulin receptor exon  <dig>  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig> there was no significant effect of skip  <dig> - <dig>  -5b and -3b aso transfection on the pattern of insulin receptor, tsc <dig>  or caspase- <dig> alternative splicing, suggesting that the effects of our asos on apob exon  <dig> are not explained by a generalized and non-specific alteration of alternative splicing.

the skip  <dig> mrna is translated into a secreted polypeptide
the skip  <dig> mrna encodes a truncated protein, apob87skip <dig>  which contains the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid residues of apob <dig> along with a divergent  <dig> amino acid peptide at the c-terminus, ending at a premature termination codon within the exon  <dig> sequence. those mrnas that harbor a premature termination codon  more than 55– <dig> nt upstream of the last exon-exon junction are subject to surveillance and down-regulation, in a process known as nonsense-mediated decay . the skip  <dig> mrna's ptc is  <dig> nt upstream of the exon 28– <dig> junction, and is a candidate for down-regulation by nmd. we treated skip 27-3b aso-transfected cells with cycloheximide, which is known to inhibit nmd in hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . under these conditions we did not see up-regulation of the skip  <dig> mrna, indicating that skip  <dig> mrna appears not to be subject to down-regulation by nmd . although this is somewhat surprising, some potential substrates for nmd appear to escape nmd  <cit>  and it is possible that the skip  <dig> mrna contains a stabilizer element, similar in function to that found in the pgk <dig> mrna in yeast  <cit> , which allows it to escape nmd. in addition, the apobec- <dig> complementation factor acf  <cit> , which is present within hepg <dig> cells, is known to protect edited apob mrna from nmd  <cit> , and it is possible that this protection is extended to the skip  <dig> mrna.

as the skip  <dig> mrna is not subject to nmd, we considered the possibility that apob87skip <dig> might be translated from the skip  <dig> mrna. in order to assess this, aso-treated hepg <dig> cells were labelled with 35s-methionine/cysteine. the cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated with anti-apob, subjected to sds-page and then to autoradiography. fig.  <dig> shows that the cells treated with the skip 27-3b aso expressed two isoforms: a long isoform corresponding to apob <dig> and a short isoform consistent with apob87skip <dig>  both isoforms were recovered from the cell lysates and from the culture medium. neither the mock-transfected cells, nor the cells treated with skip 27-3b scram expressed apob87skip <dig> 

interestingly, the relative ratios of apob <dig> and apob87skip <dig> differed between that found in the cell lysate and that secreted into the medium. in the cell lysate, there appears to be a predominance of apob87skip <dig> over apob <dig>  in the medium, there is a predominance of apob <dig> over apob87skip <dig>  this may be due to decreased secretion of apob87skip <dig> relative to apob <dig>  causing an increased cellular retention of apob87skip <dig> relative to apob <dig>  this is a finding that parallels the decreased secretion rate of the apob <dig> truncation in apob <dig> heterozygotes  <cit> . we conclude, therefore, that the skip  <dig> mrna is translated into the apob87skip <dig> isoform and that this protein is secreted into the culture medium along with apob <dig> 

discussion
due to its role in the assembly of the atherogenic lipoprotein particles ldl and lp, apob has become a prime target for therapeutic interventions to reduce ldl and lp levels, and therefore perhaps to retard atherosclerosis. approaches that have been used include over-expression of apobec- <dig> to induce rna editing of apob mrna and isoform switching to apob <dig>  <cit> , rnase h-mediated degradation of apob mrna using asos  <cit> , and rna interference with sirna duplexes  <cit> . we demonstrate in this paper that asos targeted to the splice-sites of apob exon  <dig> are effective in inducing alternative splicing of exon  <dig>  and that this skip  <dig> mrna is translated to a short isoform of apob, apob87skip <dig>  we are conscious that hepg <dig> cells, although they are able to synthesize and secrete apob, do not assemble normal vldl or ldl  <cit> . however, the data presented suggests that it is in principle feasible to induce the skipping of the normally constitutive exon  <dig> in hepatocytes. should further work demonstrate that it is possible to do this in vivo with injected or ingested asos, we speculate that this could potentially form the basis of a therapy to reduce apob <dig> expression and to reduce circulating ldl and cholesterol levels.

our work relies on 2'o-methyl rna oligonucleotides as splice-site asos, and joins a growing list of synthetic nucleic acid-based compounds that have been used to modify splicing  <cit> . asos employing a combination of phosphorothioate and 2'o-methyl rna modifications have been used to modify dystrophin splicing  <cit> , ß-globin splicing  <cit> , and smn <dig> splicing  <cit> . other chemistries such as 2'o-methoxyethyl aso  <cit> , morpholino aso  <cit> , peptide-nucleic acid  compounds  <cit>  and chimeric dna/locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides  <cit>  represent alternatives that might, in future work, be used to modify apob exon  <dig> splicing. we have also used pna-peptide chimeras in an approach termed essence . these compounds comprise an antisense sequence that targets the compound specifically to a particular exon. the antisense sequence is linked to rs dipeptide repeats which serve to activate splicing and inclusion of the targeted exon. this approach has been successfully used to modify the alternative splicing in the smn <dig> pre-mrna  <cit>  and the bcl-x pre-mrna  <cit> . the final choice for the chemistry of a therapeutic compound will depend crucially on several factors, including the efficacy of apob exon  <dig> skipping, the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, the efficiency of translocation across the cell and nuclear membranes, and the safety of the compound.

apob87skip <dig> is predicted to consist of the n-terminal  <dig> residues of apob <dig>  as there is a frameshift induced by the skipping of exon  <dig>  part of the exon  <dig> sequence is translated to a divergent  <dig> amino acid sequence at the c-terminus. we postulate that this isoform, if assembled into vldl and ldl, will have similar properties to the c-terminally truncated isoforms that have been described and characterized in kindreds with natural mutations in apob causing hypobetalipoproteinemia. one such mutant isoform, apob <dig>  is produced by a single nucleotide deletion in exon  <dig>  and lowers circulating cholesterol levels to the 5th percentile  <cit> . patients heterozygous for apob <dig> synthesize and secrete apob <dig> at 92% of the rate of apob <dig>  but ldl particles containing apob <dig> show greater fractional catabolic rates compared to those containing apob <dig>  most likely due to the greater affinity of apob89-containing particles for the ldl receptor  <cit> . apob <dig> also appears to have a dominant negative effect on the secretion rate of apob <dig>  reducing the production rate in apob <dig> heterozygotes to 30% compared to normal individuals  <cit> . the combination of these phenomena, therefore, leads to a disproportionate decrease in ldl and cholesterol levels in apob <dig> heterozygotes. deletion of the c-terminal 10% of the protein renders apob unable to assemble into lp  <cit> . consistent with this, in apob <dig> heterozygotes, apob <dig> is not associated with the lp particles in these patients. however, lp levels are not decreased in these individuals. the circulating lp particles contain apob <dig> exclusively, and are indistinguishable from normal lp in terms of size and density  <cit> .

another mutant isoform seen in patients with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, apob87padova, is caused by a single nucleotide deletion at the 5' end of exon  <dig>  leading to a shortened isoform comprising the n-terminal  <dig> residues of apob plus a divergent c-terminal  <dig> amino acid sequence. this c-terminal sequence, which results from the frameshift of exon  <dig> sequence introduced by the deletion, is identical over 36/ <dig> residues with the c-terminal divergent sequence of apob87skip <dig>  as the same frameshift is introduced by skipping exon  <dig>  consequently, apob87padova is an isoform that is very similar to apob87skip <dig>  the principal difference being that apob87padovaincludes the apob sequence coded by exon  <dig>  as with apob <dig>  the apob87padova-containing ldl from these patients exhibits an increased fractional catabolic rate and decreased production compared to normal individuals, leading to cholesterol levels about 2/3rd normal and ldl levels of about 50% normal in heterozygous individuals  <cit> . if it were possible to partially induce apob87skip <dig> expression in vivo, this could cause a decreased secretion rate of apob <dig>  and that apob87skip27-containing vldl, idl and ldl would be cleared at a faster rate than normal, leading to decreased levels of these particles. however, since these asos only induce partial exon  <dig> skipping, apob <dig> would still be synthesized and assembled into lp. therefore, we would also predict that this would not change lp levels. we can foresee one theoretical problem with our therapeutic approach. should it be possible to induce apob87skip <dig> in vivo, the presence of the  <dig> amino acid divergent sequence at the c-terminus could induce an immune response to the novel epitope thus generated. it is unknown at this time as to whether this immune response might have any clinical consequences such as antibody interference with apob87skip <dig> function or an autoimmune response.

a therapy based on apob87skip <dig> induction may have particular utility in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, such as those with familial defective apob <dig> . this condition is due to point mutations that disrupt the conformation of the ldl receptor-binding domain of apob, leading to decreased affinity for the receptor, decreased clearance of vldl/idl/ldl particles, hypercholesterolemia, and therefore an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease  <cit> . the most common mutation, r3500q, appears to be quite prevalent in western and central european populations, with a heterozygote prevalence of ~1/ <dig> in switzerland  <cit> . c-terminal deletions of apob restore the ability of fdb ldl particles to bind to the ldl receptor  <cit> . we predict, therefore, that induction of apob87skip <dig> in patients with fdb would be expected to restore the ability of apob87skip27-containing ldl to bind to its cognate receptor. furthermore, we speculate that patients with familial hypercholesterolemia due to ldl receptor mutations may benefit from the induction of apob87skip <dig> by increasing the affinity of apo87-containing ldl for the ldl receptor.

the various methods that have so far been proposed for down-regulating apob <dig> expression have encountered various side-effects, some of them of a serious nature. for example, the over-expression of apobec- <dig> in mouse livers led to liver dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinomas, a phenomenon that has been attributed to promiscuous editing of mrnas other than apob  <cit> . another problem common to those therapeutic interventions that generally down-regulate apob mrna levels is that they have the potential to repress both apob <dig> and apob <dig> expression. in the case of rna interference by cholesterol-conjugated sirna, apob48-containing chylomicron levels are reduced by approximately 50%  <cit> . the aso isis  <dig>  when administered to mice, down-regulates the apob mrna and causes a 90% reduction in circulating and liver levels of both apob <dig> and apob <dig>  although, interestingly, no reduction in apob <dig> protein levels is seen in the intestine  <cit> . this reduction in apob <dig> expression could interfere with chylomicron assembly and potentially cause fat malabsorption from the intestine, a serious side effect. induction of exon  <dig> skipping by asos, however, might not be subject to this problem, as the rna editing site resides within exon  <dig>  the skip  <dig> mrna should therefore be edited in the intestine, and translated to result in apob <dig>  consistent with this supposition, patients with apob <dig> familial hypobetalipoproteinemia produce intestinal apob <dig> as normal  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
high circulating ldl and cholesterol levels are associated with atherosclerosis, and therapeutic interventions to reduce these levels have been shown to decrease the incidence of the complications of atherosclerosis, such as heart attacks and strokes. despite modern treatments such as hmg coa reductase inhibitors, there remains a demand for other interventions to reduce ldl and cholesterol levels. using aso-induced alternative splicing of apob mrna, we have demonstrated that it is possible to induce the expression of a novel isoform of apob that simulates hypobetalipoproteinemia, and which should reduce circulating ldl and cholesterol levels. this represents a new and promising technique that may therefore have applications in therapeutic modification of apob <dig> expression.
