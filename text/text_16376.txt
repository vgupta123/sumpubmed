BACKGROUND
rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that was recently approved for treating kidney carcinomas  <cit> . it is known to inhibit the tor <dig>  kinase signalling pathway leading to growth inhibition  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, several factors have been identified through genome-wide screens that when deleted cause resistance to rapamycin  <cit> . one of these proteins is rrd <dig>  that was first reported to play a role in protecting cells against oxidative dna damage caused by the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide  and by uva  <cit> . mutants deficient in rrd <dig> are also unable to undergo rapamycin-induced growth arrest and therefore exhibit marked resistance to the drug  <cit> . rrd <dig> is conserved in eukaryotes and shares 35% identity with the human phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator, hptpa, which was initially isolated as a protein that stimulated the weak phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity of the type 2a ser/thr phosphatase pp2a  <cit> . we and others reported that rrd <dig> can physically interact with the ser/thr phosphatase sit <dig>  a pp2a like phosphatase  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, rapamycin binds to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase fpr <dig> and this drug-protein complex inactivates the tor <dig> kinase causing a profound modification in the transcriptional profile, and culminating in g <dig> growth arrest  <cit> . inhibition of tor <dig> leads to the activation of sit <dig>  by virtue of its dissociation from the inhibitor complex tap42-sit <dig>  which in turn dephosphorylates several targets including the nutrient-responsive transcriptional activator gln <dig> that translocates to the nucleus to activate gln <dig> and mep <dig> expression  <cit> . however, these sit4-dependent processes do not require the function of rrd <dig>  suggesting that the latter protein might execute a function downstream in the tor <dig> signalling pathway  <cit> .

recent data indicate that rrd <dig> exerts an effect at the transcriptional level  <cit> . genes known to be upregulated  and down-regulated  following rapamycin exposure showed an altered transcription pattern in rrd1Δ mutants  <cit> . to date, the exact function executed by rrd <dig> causing alteration in transcription has not been investigated. rrd <dig> and its mammalian counterpart ptpa have been shown to possess an in vitro peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase  activity on model substrates  <cit> . ppiases are ubiquitous proteins that catalytically facilitate the cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds n-terminal to proline residues within polypeptide chains  <cit> . both rrd <dig> and ptpa can independently change the structure of short peptides including the synthetic substrate  representing a conserved sequence amongst pp2a phosphatases  <cit> . as such, it has been suggested that rrd1/ptpa could activate pp2as via this ppiase activity  <cit> . so far, neither the in vivo target nor the biological function of the ppiase activity of rrd <dig> has been elucidated, although this is not the case for other ppiases. for example, the ppiases ess <dig> and pin <dig> from s. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, respectively, possess the ability to associate with the c-terminal domain  of rpb <dig>  <cit> . in yeast, the ctd consists of  <dig> repeats of the ys2pts5ps <dig> heptad sequence and ess <dig> has been shown to stimulate the dephosphorylation of ser- <dig> to efficiently terminate transcription of a subset of genes  <cit> .

in this study, we show that rrd <dig> is associated with rna pol ii and isomerizes the ctd of rpb <dig> in vivo and in vitro. our data suggest a model whereby this isomerization leads to the dissociation of rna pol ii from the chromatin resulting in transcriptional changes. this study provides insight into a possible new mechanism by which rna pol ii could rapidly respond to transcriptional changes.

co-immunoprecipitation experiments
co-immunoprecipitation was done as previously described  <cit> , except using 8wg <dig> antibody  covalently coupled to aminolink matrix  and total extracts  <cit>  prepared from cells expressing either myc- or gfp-tagged form of the indicated proteins or from the untagged parent or rrd1Δ mutant cells. the matrix with bound proteins was washed four times with a buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl, and  <dig> % np <dig>  the input  used in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment as well as half the volume of the matrix were assessed by western blot using either anti-myc, -gfp , or -ubiquitin . the remaining half of the matrix was analyzed separately by western blot probed with 8wg <dig> antibody.

gst and gst-ctd purification
strains bearing either pgst  or pgst-ctd plasmid were subcultured in  <dig> ml selective media to an od <dig> of ~ <dig> , then treated with the appropriate drug for the indicated time. cells were centrifuged, washed once with sterile water, and resuspended in  <dig>  ml of yeast extraction buffer and extracts were prepared as above. the extracts were centrifuged at  <dig> rpm in an eppendorf centrifuge at 4°c for  <dig> min. lysates were diluted 3- <dig> folds in pbs and triton x- <dig> was added to a final concentration of  <dig> %. one and half ml of glutathione sepharose 4b matrix  was equilibrated with  <dig> ml of pbs in  <dig> ml falcon tube then the lysate  was added and allowed to bind for one hour at room temperature on a rotating platform. the matrix was washed  <dig> times with pbs then transferred to  <dig> ml disposable column . excess of pbs was allowed to flow through, then gst-ctd was eluted with  <dig> fractions each of  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm reduced glutathione . peak fractions were pooled to a total volume of  <dig> μl and the buffer was exchanged to  <dig> μl phosphate buffer using centricon . purity of the samples was verified by sds-page followed by silver staining.

interaction between rrd1-myc and gst-ctd
total protein extracts derived from parent cells  expressing gst-ctd or gst-apn <dig>  untreated or treated with rapamycin  were allowed to bind to  <dig> ml gst affinity matrix slurry as described for the purification, except samples were not eluted from the columns. a second protein extract  derived from a strain expressing rrd1-myc or yap8-myc was applied and allowed to bind for  <dig> h at room temperature on a rotating platform. the columns were then washed with  <dig> bed volumes of pbs and an aliquot of the beads  was loaded onto an 8% sds-page and processed for western blot. the presence of gst-ctd on both columns was detected using polyclonal anti-gst  and the bound rrd1-myc was revealed using anti-myc monoclonal antibody .

RESULTS
rrd <dig> is associated with the chromatin and interacts with rpb1
we previously demonstrated that rrd <dig> is required to modulate the expression of a subset of rapamycin-regulated genes independently of sit <dig>  <cit> . to corroborate our earlier findings that rrd <dig> acts separately from the sit4-gln <dig> signaling pathway, we deleted the rrd <dig> gene in the gln3Δ background  and examined the resulting gln3Δ rrd1Δ double mutant for the level of resistance to the drug  <cit> . this genetic analysis revealed that the gln3Δ rrd1Δ double mutant was significantly more resistant to rapamycin than either of the single mutants , suggesting that rrd <dig> performs a distinct role to regulate response to the drug.

to investigate this potentially novel role of rrd <dig>  we first checked whether rrd <dig> binds to chromatin in light of its involvement in gene regulation  <cit> . chromatin fractions were derived from strains expressing myc-tagged rrd <dig>  as well as the control proteins swe <dig>  rad <dig> and apn <dig> from the endogenous loci and subjected to western blot analysis probed with anti-myc antibody. as shown in figure 1a, a significant amount of rrd1-myc was found in the chromatin fraction , suggesting that rrd <dig> is associated with the chromatin and consistent with an earlier study showing that rrd <dig> is also present in the nucleus  <cit> . in contrast, the control protein swe1-myc was only found in the soluble fraction , while rad52-myc and apn1-myc, two dna repair proteins known to bind chromatin, were present in the chromatin fraction   <cit> .

since rrd <dig> is bound to the chromatin and is involved in regulating gene expression, we tested if it is associated with rna pol ii by performing co-immunoprecipitation analysis. for this experiment, we used total extracts derived from cells expressing either rrd1-myc or swe1-myc and checked for the pull-down with anti-rpb <dig> . rrd1-myc was co-immunoprecipitated with rpb <dig>  but not the control protein swe1-myc . since only a small amount of rrd1-myc was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-rpb <dig>  the association between rrd <dig> and rna pol ii may be weak or transient. there was no alteration in the amount of rrd <dig> co-immunoprecipitated by anti-rpb <dig> when cells were treated with rapamycin  .

anti-rpb <dig> also co-immunoprecipitated rrd <dig> from parent cells carrying a plasmid expressing gfp-tagged rrd <dig> . in addition, the sit <dig> phosphatase known to physically interact with rrd <dig>  <cit>  co-immunoprecipitated with rpb <dig> from parent cells expressing this protein as gfp fusion . two additional gfp fusion proteins, gfp-imp <dig> and gfp-rad <dig>  which do not interact with rrd <dig>  were not co-immunoprecipitated with anti-rpb <dig> antibody, although a minute amount of gfp-rad <dig> non-specifically interacted with the beads used for immunoprecipitation . thus, rpb <dig> associates with proteins known to bind rrd <dig>  suggesting that rrd <dig> could exist in a complex with rpb <dig>  we note that the reverse co-immunoprecipitation with rrd1-myc did not pull down rpb <dig> under the same reaction conditions, raising the possibility that the size of the rna pol ii complex might impede the pull down although we cannot exclude other alternatives such as a weak or indirect interaction via another protein.

rrd <dig> associates with the ctd of rpb <dig> and alters its structure in response to rapamycin
since the c-terminal domain  of rpb <dig> is a repeated sequence  rich in proline residues, and has previously been shown to bind the isomerases ess <dig> and pin <dig>  <cit> , we reasoned that rrd <dig> could function to isomerize the ctd. as such, we assessed whether the ctd is a substrate for the ppiase activity of rrd <dig> in vivo. the ctd was expressed as a gst fusion protein from a previously described plasmid  and has been shown to undergo post-translational modifications including ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> phosphorylation, isomerization and ubiquitylation  <cit> . introduction of this plasmid into the parent and rrd1Δ strains directed the expression of the gst-ctd fusion protein with the expected size  as determined by western blot analysis probed with anti-gst antibodies . the gst-ctd contained both phosphorylated ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> as detected by anti-h <dig> and anti-h <dig> antibodies, which specifically recognize ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> phosphorylation, respectively , consistent with previous studies that the gst-ctd can be functionally modified in vivo  <cit> . from these analyses, we observed no differences in the  size,  level of expression, and  phosphorylation of the gst-ctd whether it was derived from the parent or the rrd1Δ mutant or from cells that were pretreated with rapamycin .

we next prepared gst-ctd affinity beads from parent cells and determined whether these could pull down rrd <dig>  total extract derived from the parent strain expressing rrd1-myc  was incubated with the gst-ctd affinity beads. the beads were recovered, washed and an aliquot examined for retention of rrd1-myc by western blot analysis. as shown in figure 2c and 2d, rrd1-myc was pulled down by the gst-ctd affinity beads. in contrast, the gst-ctd affinity beads did not pull down the transcriptional activator yap <dig>  also tagged with myc . as expected, the empty beads did not pull down rrd1-myc from the total extract nor did the control beads carrying gst-apn <dig> . these data support the notion that rrd <dig> associates with the ctd of rpb <dig>  consistent with the above observation that rpb <dig> co-immunoprecipitated rrd <dig> 

we next investigated whether rrd <dig> could induce conformational changes in the gst-ctd fusion protein by using circular dichroism  spectroscopy, a method that is very sensitive to changes in the secondary structure of proteins  <cit> . we first purified the gst-ctd from the parent and the rrd1Δ mutant, as well as gst from the parent to be used as the control. silver stain analysis of the purified gst-ctd revealed that there was no difference in the size of this protein, whether it was derived from the parent or the rrd1Δ mutant  or when the cells were treated with rapamycin . as observed for total extract, the purified gst-ctd also contained both phosphorylated forms, ser- <dig> and ser- <dig>  but showed no alteration in response to rapamycin . to ensure that the observed phosphorylation status of the gst-ctd is similar to rpb <dig> ctd phosphorylation, we purified rpb <dig> from the tap tagged strains and monitored this protein for its phosphorylation. like the gst-ctd, rpb1-tap showed no differences in either ser- <dig> or ser- <dig> phosphorylation following rapamycin treatment . however, this approach may not distinguish between subtle phosphorylation differences that may occur amongst the heptad repeats  <cit> . since the gst-ctd is similarly phosphorylated as the endogenous rpb <dig>  we used it as a tool for further analysis.

cd spectra obtained for the purified gst-ctd derived from either the untreated parent or rrd1Δ mutant were indistinguishable, and displayed a minimum at  <dig> nm . in contrast, gst-ctd derived from the parent cells treated with rapamycin exhibited a spectrum with a minimum at  <dig> nm and shoulder at ~ <dig> nm , suggesting that the gst-ctd underwent a detectable change in its secondary structure. remarkably, rapamycin treatment of the rrd1Δ mutant failed to induce this conformational change onto the gst-ctd . introduction of a single copy plasmid expressing functional rrd <dig> in the rrd1Δ mutant restored the change in the spectral pattern of the gst-ctd   <cit> . additionally, purified gst alone derived from untreated or rapamycin treated parent cells did not exhibit any structural differences, suggesting that it is the ctd portion of the fusion protein that is undergoing the rapamycin-induced changes . we further confirmed the structural change of the gst-ctd as observed by cd using limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin, which can distinguish proteins with different secondary structures and exclusively cleaves peptides in the trans-proline conformation  <cit> . as shown in figure 3e, the gst-ctd purified from the rapamycin-treated parent cells was more resistant to limited chymotrypsin digestion, as opposed to the gst-ctd derived from the untreated cells, suggesting that indeed the gst-ctd went through a structural reorganization in response to rapamycin. on the basis of these findings, it would appear that the ctd of rpb <dig> changes its structure in vivo following exposure to rapamycin, and that rrd <dig> is essential for this alteration.

rrd <dig> alters the gst-ctd structure in response to 4-nqo, but not mms
we next checked if isomerization of the ctd is specific for rapamycin. since the rrd1Δ mutant was previously shown to be sensitive to the dna damaging agent 4-nqo  <cit> , which induces oxidative stress as well as creating bulky lesions onto the dna  <cit> , we examined for isomerization of the gst- ctd in the parent and the mutant following treatment with this drug. we observed that the structure of the gst-ctd was altered in the parent, but not in the rrd1Δ mutant following 4-nqo treatment . we also tested another dna damaging agent, methyl methane sulfonate  , to which the rrd1Δ mutant displays parental sensitivity  <cit> . mms creates apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in the genome, and for this experiment it was used at a concentration that kills ~70% of the cells. under this condition, the gst-ctd showed no structural alteration following the mms treatment . on the basis of these findings, it would appear that this phenomenon might occur for other stress conditions besides exposure to rapamycin.

rrd <dig> directly alters the structure of the ctd in vitro
we next examined whether purified rrd <dig> can induce structural changes onto the ctd in vitro. to do this, we incubated equimolar amounts of recombinant his-rrd <dig> purified from e. coli  with affinity purified gst-ctd derived from the rrd1Δ mutant at 30°c for  <dig> min, and then recovered the gst-ctd for cd analysis. as shown in figure 5b, purified his-rrd <dig> significantly modified the ctd structure under the standard phosphate buffer reaction conditions. since the rrd <dig> isomerase activity has been shown to be stimulated by atp and mg2+  <cit> , we examined the effect of these additions to the reaction mixture. inclusion of atp and mg2+ in the buffer caused no structural alteration to the ctd in the absence of rrd <dig> . however, addition of purified his-rrd <dig> to the complete atp/mg2+ phosphate buffer introduced a more dramatic change to the ctd structure, as compared to the mixture lacking atp/mg2+ . moreover, the purified his-rrd <dig> did not confer any structural changes onto another purified gst fusion protein, gst-apn <dig> . these findings suggest that rrd <dig> can directly isomerize the ctd.

comparison of rna pol ii occupancy at rapamycin-responsive genes
since rrd <dig> associates with and isomerizes the ctd, and that rrd1Δ mutant did not affect the phosphorylation status of rpb <dig>  we asked whether it would alter rna pol ii occupancy on rapamycin responsive genes in vivo. to do this, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis of rpb <dig> on two known rna pol ii-responsive genes, rps26a and cpa <dig>  <cit> . since both genes are known to be rapidly downregulated and upregulated, respectively, within  <dig> min, we treated cells for this time period with rapamycin  <cit> . in parent cells, the rpb1-chip signal from the rps26a gene was reduced by nearly 8-fold upon rapamycin treatment . in contrast, rpb <dig> remained associated with rps26a in the rrd1Δ mutant . in the case of the upregulated gene cpa <dig>  we observed an increase in rpb1-chip signal in the parent upon rapamycin, whereas in the mutant there was only a modest increase in the signal . the occupancy of rna pol ii on these genes is consistent with the mrna expression levels  <cit> . these data raise the possibility that rrd <dig> might displace rpb <dig> in order to optimize rapid transcriptional changes caused by rapamycin.

purified rrd <dig> stimulates the release of chromatin-bound rna pol ii in vitro
to explore the above possibility, we examined if purified rrd <dig> would displace rna pol ii from the chromatin. briefly, we isolated chromatin containing rna pol ii derived from the rrd1Δ mutant, the chromatin was washed and resuspended in the standard phosphate buffer containing atp and mg2+. to this reaction, increasing amounts of purified rrd <dig> was added and following incubation the levels of chromatin-bound and soluble rpb <dig> were monitored by western blot. as shown in figure  <dig> increasing concentration of rrd <dig> caused a loss of chromatin-bound rpb <dig>  while there was a correlating gain in the soluble fraction. in contrast, rrd <dig> concentration did not affect the level of the control protein apn1-myc. collectively, our data indicate that rrd <dig> possesses the ability to isomerize the ctd of rpb <dig> thereby promoting its displacement from the chromatin.

discussion
in the present study, we show that rrd <dig> is a chromatin bound protein, which associates with rna pol ii and presumably through the ctd of rpb <dig>  we believe that this association allows isomerization of the ctd in response to specific stress such as that caused by rapamycin and 4-nqo. in addition, we show that in vitro purified rrd <dig>  can directly alter the structure of the ctd and  dissociate rpb <dig> from the chromatin. on the basis of these observations, we propose the following model whereby in response to specific stress conditions the rna pol ii associated rrd <dig> isomerizes the ctd of rpb <dig> such that the polymerase is dissociated from the chromatin. once the rna pol ii is released it would be recruited to stress-responsive genes.

there is supporting evidence that elongating rna pol ii is in excess on ribosomal protein genes, surprisingly associated with a low transcriptional rate under glucose grown conditions  <cit> . however, once these cells are submitted to a metabolic change, e.g., a switch to galactose growth conditions, the level of rna pol ii decreased on these ribosomal genes and the transcriptional rate increased  <cit> . this shift also simultaneously caused an enrichment of rna pol ii onto mitochondrial genes  <cit> . this suggests a mechanism where excessive rna pol ii is removed from the ribosomal genes and recruited to mitochondrial genes to increase expression. therefore, metabolic switches would stimulate re-localization of elongating rna pol ii from one regulon to the other. as it is known that rapamycin mimics starvation conditions and represses ribosomal biogenesis, we suspect a similar mechanism as the glucose-galactose shift is operational to rapidly change transcription. besides rrd <dig>  another well characterized peptidyl prolyl isomerase pin <dig> can trigger the release of rna pol ii from transcribing genes in human cells  <cit> . under normal conditions, pin <dig> interacts with the phosphorylated ctd of rna pol ii and this association is retained along the length of transcribed genes  <cit> . however, when pin <dig> is overexpressed it promotes hyperphosphorylation of the ctd during the transition from initiation to elongation, thereby causing rna pol ii to dissociate from active genes and leading to the inhibition of transcription  <cit> . the dissociated rna pol ii accumulates in enlarged speckle-associated structures enriched for transcription and rna processing factors  <cit> .

because rrd <dig> intersects with the biological functions of pin <dig>  it is possible that rrd <dig> could modulate the phosphorylation status of the ctd. recent studies showed that the yeast homologue of pin <dig>  ess <dig>  binds and catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of the ctd such that ser- <dig> phosphorylation can be dephosphorylated by the ssu <dig> phosphatase  <cit> . moreover, a variant of ess <dig>  caused accumulation of ser- <dig> phosphorylation, and not ser- <dig> phosphorylation, both of which were monitored using the same set of antibodies  as in this study  <cit> . we found no alteration in the global ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> phosphorylation status upon rapamycin treatment, as well as between the parent and the rrd1Δ mutant using the same set of antibodies . as such, it would seem that rrd <dig> uses a novel mechanism independent of phosphorylation to isomerize the ctd, although we cannot exclude the possibility that there are unique ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> phosphorylation differences which can be masked by neighboring phosphorylations, for example, where one heptad is phosphorylated, but not the adjacent  <cit> . however, since rna pol ii exists in different phosphorylation forms throughout the transcription cycle, it seems logical to have a mechanism that triggers rna pol ii release independent of its phosphorylation status.

in yeast, the ctd consists of  <dig> repeats of the heptad sequence ysptsps. it exists largely in a disordered structure, but adopts a static conformation upon interaction with target proteins such as the mediator complex that regulates transcription initiation and enzymes that modify the 5' and 3'ends of mrna  <cit> . binding of these proteins to the ctd is modulated by serine phosphorylation and proline isomerization  <cit> . thus, a given heptad repeat could give rise to many different conformations with the various combinations of phosphorylated ser- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  as well as the cis/trans isomerization of the two prolines, pro- <dig> and pro- <dig>  to generate a broad range of binding sites to allow precise association with several factors  <cit> . at least three ctd interacting proteins  have been shown to bind exclusively the all-trans conformation, providing support for the hypothesis that proline isomerization of the ctd plays a critical regulatory role  <cit> . this strongly suggests that multiple conformations of the ctd exist in vivo. consistent with this notion, we observed by cd analysis two conformations of the ctd that remained stable throughout its purification  from untreated and rapamycin-treated cells . these different conformations could be the result of proline isomerization, as prolines are known to be stable in either the cis or trans conformation when the protein is in a folded form  <cit> . only peptidyl prolyl isomerases such as pin1/ess <dig> are known to trigger a switch between the cis and trans conformations of the ctd  <cit> , and that in the absence of these enzymes the conformational switch is slow  <cit> . because rrd <dig> possesses peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity and it associates with rna pol ii, it seems likely that this function is responsible for inducing structural changes to the ctd upon rapamycin exposure. in support of this, rrd <dig> directly alters the ctd structure in vitro , and we therefore predict that rrd <dig> might act in a similar manner onto the ctd in vivo.

in addition to rapamycin, we also observed that the dna damaging agent 4-nqo, but not mms, triggered alteration of the ctd structure . we examined the effect of 4-nqo, as we had previously shown that rrd1Δ mutants were sensitive to this agent and not to mms  <cit> . the distinct difference between 4-nqo and mms is that the former agent potently induces the production of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anions  <cit> . both starvation and oxidative stress are known to mediate similar transcriptional programs, also termed as the environmental stress response, for example, where ribosome biogenesis is turned off  <cit> . this would explain why the rrd1Δ mutants are sensitive to 4-nqo, but resistant to rapamycin;  genes required for counteracting the 4-nqo-induced oxidative stress are not turned on efficiently and as a result the cells accumulate genotoxic lesions, and  under rapamycin condition nutrients are still available and the failure to alter gene expression allows rrd1Δ mutants to grow.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data suggest that rrd <dig> participates in a novel mechanism that allows redistribution of rna pol ii for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in specific stress conditions. these results provide the first direct evidence that rrd <dig> acts in vivo as an isomerase and establish a physiological function for this activity.
