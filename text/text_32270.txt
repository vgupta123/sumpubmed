BACKGROUND
radiata pine  is the dominant forest plantation species for the sawmill industry in australia, new zealand, chile and some other countries. breeding programs in radiata pine have been conducted in australia since the early 1950s. the first generation of breeding increased the growth rate by 33%, thus reduced the rotation period to 27– <dig> yrs from the previous 40– <dig> yrs  <cit> . consequently, the faster growth rate resulted in a large proportion  of juvenile wood in the harvested logs  <cit> . juvenile wood has a number of undesirable wood properties  <cit>  and its higher proportion in the harvested logs reduces the value of timber products. improving juvenile wood quality and reducing its proportion have been identified as the priorities in the next generation breeding program of radiata pine. understanding wood formation at the molecular level would underpin more efficient breeding strategies for the improvement of juvenile wood.

genomics approaches have been applied to explore the molecular basis of growth and development in forest tree species. expressed sequence tags  and microarray gene expression studies have been carried out in poplar, loblolly pine, spruce and eucalypts  <cit> . due to the economic value of wood, all forest genomic projects were primarily focused on the transcriptional regulation of wood formation . xylogenesis is initiated in the vascular cambium and proceeded from cell division to expansion, secondary wall formation, lignification, and finally programmed cell death  <cit> . large numbers of xylogenesis ests from forest tree species have been deposited in public databases, including  <dig>  ests from loblolly pine,  <dig>  ests from poplars,  <dig>  ests from white spruce and  <dig>  ests from sitka spruce . furthermore, the genome of populus trichocarpa  has been published  <cit> , and efforts to sequence the eucalyptus grandis genome  are in progress  <cit> . however, the large conifer genome   <cit>  is unlikely to be sequenced in the near future, thus est sequencing remains an important approach for gene discovery in conifers.

despite the commercial importance of radiata pine in many countries, little genomic research has been done for this species compared to loblolly pine, populus, spruce, maritime pine and eucalypts. as of january  <dig>   <dig>  only  <dig> radiata pine ests appear in the ncbi genebank , and no unigene information is available. recently,  <dig> genes were observed to be differentially expressed in the base to the crown of the radiata pine trees using modified differential display  <cit> . gene expression in the early embryogenesis of pinus radiata was studied using the cdna-aflps strategy, which revealed a total of  <dig> up- or down-regulated transcript-derived fragments   <cit> . development of juvenile and mature wood in radiata pine is still poorly characterised at the genomics level.

we applied genomics approaches to investigate the transcriptional regulation of xylogenesis in radiata pine, with a focus on juvenile wood formation. six developing xylem cdna libraries were constructed from earlywood and latewood tissues collected from juvenile , transition  and mature  trees, respectively. the sampled xylem tissues represent the major stages of wood development in a typical rotation period of radiata pine. a total of  <dig>  high quality xylogenesis ests were sequenced from  <dig>  cdna clones and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. here we report the generation and analysis of a genomic resource for wood formation in radiata pine.

RESULTS
est sequencing and assembly
in total,  <dig>  high quality ests of at least  <dig> bp in length were collected from approximately  <dig>  raw sequences. the  <dig>  ests were sequenced from  <dig>  different cdna clones in six developing xylem cdna libraries. average size of all  <dig>  ests and the  <dig>  ests from 5' end sequences is  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. of the  <dig>  ests,  <dig> % and  <dig> % are greater than  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. the number of ests in each library ranged from  <dig> in earlywood at transition age to  <dig>  in latewood at juvenile age . juvenile wood has the highest proportion of ests due to the focus of this study. the assembly of all  <dig>  ests from 5' end sequences generated  <dig>  xylogenesis unigenes, including  <dig> contigs  and  <dig>  singletons  .

a: ests from the  <dig> ends of  <dig>  clones were used in the assembly;

b: only  <dig> end ests in each library were used in the assemblies;

c: redundancy was estimated by: 1- ;

d: the average redundancy from each of six cdna libraries.

the  <dig>  unigenes have an average length of  <dig> bp;  <dig> % are more than  <dig> bp, and only  <dig> % are less than  <dig> bp. of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> %  have four or more transcripts  and the three deepest contigs included 69– <dig> transcripts. since the ests and unigenes were derived from a total of seven different genotypes of radiata pine, these deep contigs provide an opportunity to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms . the number of ests forming a contig reflects the level of est redundancy in the cdna libraries. the assembly of  <dig>  ests from 5' end sequences revealed  <dig> % of redundancy in the radiata pine est collection . however, the est redundancy in each library varies from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with an average redundancy of  <dig> % . the redundancy may increase significantly during further est sequencing. by comparison, the est redundancy in the radiata pine est collection is slightly higher than the estimated redundancy of 28% in populus   <cit>  and of 39% in white spruce   <cit> .

functional annotation and classification
blast searches of the  <dig>  ests against the ncbi nr database revealed  <dig> % and  <dig> % matches with tblastx and blastx , respectively. however,  <dig> % of all matches with blastx are either unknowns , unnamed , hypothetical  or predicted proteins . when using the uniprot database with blastx  and tigr database with blastn ,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ests have homologs and only  <dig> % of all matches are unknowns or uncharacterized proteins. of the  <dig> ests  with no matches in the uniprot and tigr databases,  <dig> ests are greater than  <dig> bp in length and remain as singletons after assembly, thus some of which are likely to represent putative novel ests in radiata pine wood formation. based on the pfam known protein family database,  <dig> % of the ests have homologs with blastx  and were classified into  <dig> protein families. nearly half of the ests  did not match the known protein families in the pfam database, thus they were regarded as unknown protein families.

of the  <dig>  xylogenesis unigenes,  <dig> % have matches in the ncbi nr database with blastx, however  <dig> % of all matches are unknowns or uncharacterized proteins. in contrast, a total of  <dig> % of the unigenes matched sequences in the uniprot  and tigr  databases and only  <dig> % of all matches were not assigned go terms . the results blasted with unigenes are similar to those with ests. in the functional classification with go terms,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  unigenes with assigned go terms have molecular functions,  <dig> % are involved in a biological process, and  <dig> % are cellular components. the three categories of go terms fell predominantly into one or two sub-categories . in the molecular function category with  <dig>  unigenes  <dig> % and  <dig> % have binding and catalytic activity, respectively. of the  <dig> unigenes in the cellular component,  <dig> % are related to cell components. as for the  <dig>  unigenes involved in biological process,  <dig> % and  <dig> % have functions in cellular process and physiological process, respectively.

*: annotation was based on blastx with unigenes against uniprot; for the no hits a further blastn was performed against the tigr database; functional classification was based on go terms.

the functional annotation of  <dig>  unigenes using the uniprot database revealed  <dig>   matches, which is slightly lower than the matches using the ncbi nr database. of the  <dig>  matched unigenes  <dig>  were assigned with go terms and matched  <dig>  different uniprot accession numbers, which suggests that possibly  <dig>  non-redundant genes with known functions have been identified in wood formation of radiata pine. significant go term enrichments of the xylogenesis related genes in radiata pine  were revealed using the david bioinformatics resources  <dig>  <cit> . the mostly enriched go terms in biological process  include cellular protein metabolic process, transport, cellular component organization and biogenesis, and catabolic process. in cellular component , cytoplasmic part, macromolecular complex, and non-membrane-bound organelle are the mostly enriched terms. while in the molecular function , nucleotide binding, transporter activity, peptidase activity, and structural molecular activity are highly enriched. further david functional classification revealed  <dig> functional groups with an enrichment score of at least  <dig>  . the most significant functional group is a cluster of  <dig> genes showing a peptidase function.

* a total of  <dig>  unigenes with homologs and non-redundant accession numbers in uniprot are included in the david functional annotation analysis, only the enriched go terms including more than 1% of genes are listed.

cell wall biosynthesis genes
in the  <dig>  ests, only  <dig> % have homologs  in the cell wall navigator, a primary wall gene database of arabidopsis  <cit> . however, all  <dig> categories of primary and secondary wall genes in the maizewall database  <cit>  were represented in the radiata pine est resource, including  <dig>  ests classified into  <dig> cell wall gene families . therefore, genes related to secondary cell walls are highly accumulated in the radiata pine est resource. the  <dig>  cell wall related ests of radiata pine were previously assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, which matched sequences in the uniprot and tigr databases with  <dig> non-redundant accession numbers, suggesting possibly  <dig> cell wall-related genes occurred in the radiata pine est resource. the most abundant cell wall gene is cellulose synthase , with a total of  <dig> ests . other cell wall related genes in the  <dig> most highly abundant genes include tubulin, arabinogalactan protein genes , s-adenosylmethionine synthetase , actin, laccase, ccoamt, methionine synthase  ,phytocyanin, pectate lyase,cellulase, sucrose synthase , expansin, chitinase and udp-glucose dehydrogenase .

some cell wall genes were moderately abundant  in the radiata pine est resource, including protective protein for beta-galactosidase , methionine synthase, proline-rich protein , translationally controlled tumor protein , alpha-galactosidase, udp-glucose glucosyltransferase, malate dehydrogenase, pectinesterase, and glycine-rich protein . other cell wall related genes including pectin methylesterases  and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases  have five ests each. eight ests encoding cyclin or cyclin-like and seven ests encoding cell cycle proteins were identified in radiata pine. these cell cycle genes can activate cell-cycle machinery and cell division  <cit> . interestingly, most genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were present in radiata pine wood formation. laccases, sams and ccoaomt are in the  <dig> highly abundant genes with  <dig> to  <dig> ests . c4h, 4cl, peroxidase, cad, c3h, comt and dirigent-like protein are moderately abundant with seven to  <dig> ests. ccr and pal also occurred with two ests each in the radiata pine est resource.

based on the pfam database,  <dig> known protein families were identified in radiata pine. the  <dig> most highly abundant families included  <dig> protein families related to cell wall biosynthesis . unsurprisingly, cellulose_synt is the most abundant family with  <dig> ests. other abundant protein families included actin, tubulin, tubulin_c, meth_synt_ <dig>  methltransf_ <dig>  peroxidase, s-adomet_synt_c, glyco_hydro_ <dig> and glyco_hydro_ <dig> . these abundant families included many known proteins associated with cell wall formation, such as cesas, actins, tubulins , methionine synthases, mete, ccoaomt, peroxidases, sams, chitinases and cellulases. however, agps are not recognized as proteins in the pfam database, thus they are not listed in the abundant protein families. the most abundant protein families here are broadly consistent with the most abundant genes based on uniprot and tigr databases .

identification of transcription factors
planttfdb, a recently developed database of transcription factor  families for  <dig> plant species  <cit> , was used to identify putative transcription factors expressed in radiata pine wood formation. blastx searches revealed  <dig> ests  of radiata pine with matches in planttfdb at e-value ≤ 10- <dig>  these homologs fell into  <dig> families  and represented  <dig> % of the  <dig> tf families in the poplar genome, suggesting extensive involvement of transcription factors in the regulation of xylogenesis gene expression. the most abundant tf family in radiata pine wood formation is phd  with  <dig> ests. other tf families with at least five ests included c3h, hb, c2h <dig>  nac, myb-related, myb, ap2-erebp, pcg, bhlh, lim, eil, hmg, c2c2-gata, lug, wrky, bzip, garp-g2-like, sbp and trihelix. the higher abundance of phd, c3h, myb, hmg, wrky, nac, hb and bzip in radiata pine xylogenesis was also observed in white spruce  <cit> .

*: % is based on the  <dig> radiata pine ests with homologs in the planttfdb.

transcriptome reorganization during wood development
the ests and unigenes from different libraries represent the transcriptome in the respective wood development stages. we compared the transcriptomes from juvenile earlywood, juvenile latewood, mature earlywood and mature latewood tissues. these four tissues were collected from trees growing within  <dig> m of each other, and at the same date for earlywood or latewood to minimize the environmental effects. comparative transcriptome analysis highlighted  <dig> and  <dig> go terms showing significant differences  in terms of est and unigene abundance, respectively. the hierarchical clustering dendrogram trees from both ests and unigenes revealed similar patterns of transcriptome reorganization during wood formation in radiata pine , which suggested that juvenile earlywood has a distinct transcriptome compared to the other three developmental stages, whereas the transcriptome of juvenile latewood is more conserved with mature earlywood and latewood. the distinct gene expression in juvenile earlywood is likely associated with the unique properties of juvenile wood.

comparative analysis of protein family revealed some known protein families more abundant in particular libraries . pectinesterase, pfkb family carbohydrate kinase, udp-glucose/gdp-mannose dehydrogenase, homeobox domain, udp-glucosyl transferase, profilin, thioredoxin, and plastocyanin-like domain were more abundant in earlywood. in contrast, cesa, sams, tctp, tubulin, dehydrin, metallothionein, protein tyrosine kinase, aminotransferase, and wd domain protein were more abundant in latewood. the protein families more abundant in juvenile wood include pectate lyase, skp <dig>  zinc-binding dehydrogenase and inorganic h+ pyrophosphatase. while plastocyanin-like, peroxidase, elongation factor, calreticulin, udp-glucose/gdp-mannose dehydrogenase, sams, glycosyl hydrolases family  <dig>  aldehyde dehydrogenase, major intrinsic protein , pectinesterase, cesa and o-methyltransferase are more abundant in mature wood. some protein families are highly represented in both latewood and mature wood, suggesting possibly similar transcriptional regulation in these developmental stages.

genes or gene families with more expression in different libraries were also identified in the radiata pine est resource . homeodomain, agp <dig>  ltp, peroxidase, glycosyl transferase, actin  <dig>  prp, malate dehydrogenase, phytocyanin and ppgb have higher expression in earlywood. in contrast, expansin , dehydrin, tubulin alpha  <dig>  comt,cc-nbs-lrr resistance-like, and green ripe-like  <dig> are more abundant in latewood. genes more expressed in juvenile wood include methionine synthase, hb <dig>  cytochrome c oxidase, alpha tubulin  <dig>  metallothionein-like, agp <dig>  etc. some genes related to secondary wall biosynthesis  are more expressed in mature wood. interestingly, in the large agp gene family, pragp <dig> is more expressed in earlywood, while pragp <dig> and prfla <dig> are more expressed in mature wood, suggesting divergent roles of different agp genes during wood formation.

go term enrichments in different stages of wood development were also revealed using david bioinformatics resources  <dig> . specifically enriched go terms in earlywood included: cellular component organization and biogenesis, membrane, protein complex, catalytic activity, hydrolase activity and transporter activity. latewood specifically enriched terms included: cellular macromolecule metabolic process, protein modification process, cytoplasm, nucleotide binding, and protein kinase activity. the number of specifically enriched go terms in juvenile wood is about two times as in mature wood, suggesting more unique gene expression in juvenile wood than mature wood . the most enriched specific go terms in juvenile wood included: cellular macromolecule metabolic process, intracellular organelle part, protein complex, hydrolase activity, and nucleotide binding; while in latewood cellular component organization and biogenesis, membrane, and transporter activity are the most enriched specific go terms. the specifically enriched go terms in different development stages are likely to reflect their unique transcriptomes.

discussion
the  <dig>  xylogenesis ests and  <dig>  unigenes described here form a significant genomic resource for radiata pine. being derived from major stages of wood development in a typical rotation period, this resource represents a broad xylogenesis transcriptome in the species. the highest proportion of ests is derived from juvenile wood and will assist in understanding transcriptional regulation at this stage. most families of genes involved in secondary cell wall development are represented in the est resource.

gene expression in secondary wall formation
lignin biosynthesis is a key developmental feature that distinguishes secondary from primary cell walls. the synthesized monolignols are transported to the apoplast, where polymerisation starts in the middle lamella and cell corners  <cit> . most genes in the monolignol pathway are represented with high or moderate abundance in radiata pine xylogenesis including sams, mete,laccase, ccoaomt, c4h, 4cl,methionine synthase,peroxidase,cad, c3h, comt and cytochrome c oxidase. a total of  <dig> radiata pine ests  were found to encode sams protein. lignin precursors are extensively methylated in the s-adenosyl methionine  dependent reaction  <cit> . in white spruce seven sams genes were previously identified  <cit> . some other lignin biosynthetic genes were also identified at lower abundance including ccr, pal and dirigent-like. the dirigent protein was presumed to act as a template for lignin polymerization  <cit> . the presence and abundance of most lignin biosynthetic genes in the radiata pine est collection suggests active secondary cell wall biosynthesis in the xylem tissues sampled.

cellulose is deposited in both primary and secondary cell walls, but is much more abundant in secondary walls. cesa is the most abundant gene in the radiata pine est collection with  <dig> ests representing six of the eight previously isolated prcesa genes  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree of plant cesas  constructed using muscle  <cit>  and mega  <dig>  <cit>  revealed that five of the six prcesa proteins identified in this study are most homologous to the secondary wall cesas of arabidopsis  <cit> . the five prcesas are also most homologous to the secondary wall cesas of populus  <cit>  and loblolly pine  <cit> . interestingly, the five prcesas cover all three sub groups of plant secondary wall cesas represented by three arabidopsis secondary wall cesas , respectively, suggesting the functional conservation of secondary wall cesas across angiosperm and gymnosperm taxa. a single est encoding prcesa <dig> was clustered with primary cell wall cesas, suggesting primary wall prcesa genes are poorly presented in the radiata pine est resource. cellulases and susy are also highly expressed during radiata pine wood formation. cellulase may be part of the cellulose synthesizing complex and required for wall assembly and elongation  <cit> . a membrane-bound cellulase isoenzyme is up-regulated in poplar secondary walls  <cit> . in scots pine susy activity was observed to peak in the zone of maturing tracheids where the secondary wall is formed, and its expression was lowest in primary wall tissues  <cit> .

hemicelluloses and pectin form a large group of heteropolysaccharides composed of d-xylose, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, l-fucose, d-mannose, d-galactose, d-galacturonate, or d-glucose. in the radiata pine est collection we identified genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of hemicellulose and pectin biosynthesis, including  <dig> ests  of udp-glucose dehydrogenase. udp-d-glucuronate synthesis is the rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of both hemicellulose and pectin  <cit> . we also identified four radiata pine ests of xyloglucan endotransglycosylases . xets can cut and rejoin xyloglucan  chains, and are believed to be important regulators of primary cell wall expansion  <cit> . one radiata pine xet is most homologous to arabidopsis xth <dig>  which belongs to the same class as pttxet16a, a poplar secondary wall xet  <cit> . the considerable involvement of xets in secondary walls is likely in the breakage and reconnection of linkages between adjacent microfibrils soon after their synthesis.

agps, agp-like proteins and flas are highly abundant in the radiata pine est collection with a total of  <dig> ests. the ortholog of loblolly pine ptaagp <dig> is the most abundant agp in radiata pine with  <dig> ests. other identified radiata pine agps include pragp <dig>  pragp <dig>  pragp-like and prflas . six loblolly pine ptaagps  were predominantly expressed in xylem  <cit> . the role of these agps in secondary wall development is currently unknown. in loblolly pine ptaagp <dig> epitopes are restricted to cells formed immediately before secondary cell wall thickening  <cit> . however, the preponderance of genes in the radiata pine est resource that are clearly involved in secondary wall development suggests that agps may also play an important role in secondary wall synthesis. agps were also found to be expressed in xylem tissues of angiosperms. in populus  <dig> flas are expressed in xylem, ten of which are up-regulated in tension wood  <cit> . while in eucalypts two flas are strongly up-regulated in upper branch wood  <cit> . a tobacco agp is a candidate linker at the cell surface to mediate signal transduction between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton  <cit> .

expression of cytoskeleton-related genes
conspicuous in the radiata pine xylem est resource are genes encoding the cytoskeletal proteins: tubulin, actin and other cytoskeletal-associated proteins. the cytoskeleton provides the structural basis for cell polarity establishment and maintenance  <cit> . cellulose microfibril arrangement and deposition is believed to be directed by cortical microtubules, the dynamic heteropolymer arrays of α-tubulin and β-tubulin proteins. a eucalyptus grandis β-tubulin gene  has been implicated in determining the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in plant secondary walls  <cit> . two populus tremuliodes α-tubulin genes  are highly expressed in wood tissues  <cit>  and ten tubulin genes in populus tremula × p. tremuliodes are up-regulated in secondary walls  <cit> . in the radiata pine est resource, a total of  <dig> ests were annotated to encode tubulin proteins, among which three tubulin genes  are highly or moderately abundant with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ests, respectively. these three prtubs are most homologous to poplar tubulin genes that are strongly expressed in xylem tissues  <cit> .

actin microfilaments ensure the delivery of vesicles to specific sites in plant cells and are involved in cell shape determination  <cit> . actin genes are highly abundant in the radiata pine est collection with a total of  <dig> ests . other actin related and interacting genes are also found, including adf, actin binding protein , actin-related protein , profilin and villin. arabidopsis has ten actin genes  <cit> , eight actin-related proteins   <cit>  and many actin-interacting proteins including profilin, actin depolymerisation factor , fimbrin, villin, rho-type small gtpase, capping protein, and actin-interacting cyclise-associated protein  <cit> . the radiata pine arps are the putative homologs to arabidopsis arp <dig>  arp <dig> and arp <dig>  suggesting the possible involvement of the arp2/ <dig> complex in actin cytoskeleton development during radiata pine xylem formation.

cytoskeleton formation involves cycling dynamics of polymerization and depolymerization of its basic structural subunits, such as g-actin and tubulin dimers. microtubule-associated proteins  and actin-binding proteins  are believed to regulate the dynamic cytoskeletal changes  <cit> . in the radiata pine est resource, several transcripts are present for maps , microtubule-binding protein  and actin-binding protein . kinesin- <dig>  is a dimeric motor protein that carries cellular cargo along microtubules  <cit> . a novel kinesin  from cotton fibers plays a role in coordinating the actin network with the cortical microtubule array  <cit> . we identified eight radiata pine ests annotated as kinesin- <dig> or kinesin-like proteins which may have similar roles in actin and microtubule interactions.

transcription factors in secondary wall formation
of the  <dig> transcription factor families in poplar genome,  <dig> families  are presented in the radiata pine xylogenesis genomic resource . these transcription factor families include many regulatory genes, such as mybs, mads-box, lim domain, zinc finger, class iii hd-zip, wrky and aux/iaa. several members of nac, myb, zinc finger, lim domain, mads-box, aux/iaa and homeodomain  are believed to regulate secondary wall biosynthesis  <cit> . mybs and zinc fingers can recognise ac elements in the promoters of many monolignol biosynthesis genes  <cit> . some members of the nac and myb families are the key switches in the transcriptional network for secondary wall development  <cit> .

three radiata pine ests of r2r3-type myb are most homolgous to the three secondary xylem myb genes  in loblolly pine and picea glauca  <cit> . in loblolly pine ptmyb <dig> and ptmyb <dig> are transcriptional activators of lignin synthesis  <cit> . the eucalyptus egmyb <dig> regulates lignin biosynthesis through binding to ac element  <cit> . homeobox domain  transcription factors were also identified in the radiata pine est resource with  <dig> ests . three radiata pine ests were annotated as aux/iaa genes. auxin can rapidly induce aux/iaa gene expression  <cit>  and five aux/iaa genes from hybrid aspen are up-regulated in xylem  <cit> .

in radiata pine est resource class iii hd-zip genes were represented by  <dig> ests . five arabidopsis hd-zip iii genes are up-regulated in secondary xylem  <cit>  and the hybrid aspen class iii hd-zip gene  is closely associated with wood formation  <cit> . eleven radiata pine ests  were annotated as lim domain and four ests  as mads-box. a tobacco lim protein can bind to the pal-box sequence in the promoter regions of several phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes  <cit> . some arabidopsis mads-box genes have been implicated in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> .

gene expression and wood properties
wood formation is a complex and continuous process involving a series of developmental stages during which considerable variation in wood properties is observed. compared to mature wood, juvenile wood shows higher spiral grain, lower density, higher microfibril angle , more longitudinal shrinkage, lower cellulose content, higher lignin content, more pectin and shorter tracheids  <cit> . compared to latewood, earlywood has higher growth rate, thinner cell walls, larger radial lumen, more lignin, lower hemicellulose, lower pectin, slightly lower cellulose, higher mfa and lower density  <cit> .

most of the distinguishing properties of juvenile wood are due to the high proportion of earlywood in the juvenile wood  <cit> . the silviscan profiling  <cit>  of mature radiata pine trees revealed the unique morphology and wood properties of juvenile earlywood compared to other wood development stages . juvenile earlywood forms a larger proportion in the early rings and has lower density, higher microfibril angle , lower modulus of elasticity  and thinner cell walls. these unique phenotypic characteristics of juvenile earlywood are likely to be caused by its distinct transcriptome . some genes involved in cellulose synthesis and secondary wall formation are more strongly expressed in latewood and mature wood than in earlywood and juvenile wood, respectively  , which may be associated with some of the observed differences in wood quality between the different wood tissues, such as cellulose content and cell wall thickness. many genes related to lignin biosynthesis are more abundant in earlywood and mature wood than in latewood and juvenile wood, respectively; however, only some genes are statistically significant  . these differences in gene abundance may give rise to the higher lignin content found in earlywood and mature wood.

a: the number of ests for the combined earlywood  libraries. total ests in the combined earlywood libraries from juvenile, transition and mature age are  <dig> ;

b: the number of ests for the combined latewood  libraries. total ests in the combined latewood libraries from juvenile, transition and mature age are  <dig> ;

c: the number of ests for the combined juvenile wood  libraries. total ests in the combined jw libraries from earlywood and latewood tissues are  <dig> ;

d: the number of ests for the combined mature wood  libraries. total ests in the combined mw libraries from earlywood and latewood tissues are  <dig> ;

e: statistical significance according to audic and claverie  <dig>  <cit> .

although audic and claverei proposed a statistical method  <cit>  to test the significance of digital gene expression, the preferentially expressed genes  derived from gene abundance analysis still require further validation, such as microarray experiments, real time rt-pcr or other alternative methods. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification   <cit>  was used in this study for validation of selected genes . the normalized ratio of est abundance and mlpa gene expression ratio is highly comparable for a proline-rich protein  gene in both earlywood and latewood at transition age, as well as for a dehydrin gene in latewood at transition age. the mlpa gene expressions of agp <dig> and peroxidase at both juvenile and transition ages confirmed their high est abundances in earlywood. however, mlpa expression values of some genes may differ from their est abundances , suggesting est abundance could not infer the exact gene expression level.

CONCLUSIONS
the radiata pine genomic resource was developed from six developing xylem libraries with  <dig>  high quality ests and  <dig>  unigenes. this is the first large scale and publicly available genomic resource for radiata pine. many genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and transcription factors were identified in the wood formation of radiata pine. comparative analysis among different development stages revealed a distinct transcriptome in juvenile earlywood. genes with relatively more expression in earlywood, latewood, juvenile wood and mature wood were also identified, respectively. the identified genes in this study will be candidates for functional genomics and association studies in radiata pine. this genomic resource will also be valuable for comparative genomics of wood formation in forest trees.
