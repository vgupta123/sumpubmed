BACKGROUND
amino acids are essential for the regulation of cell growth and proliferation  <cit>  in two ways; by providing the substrate required for polypeptide biosynthesis, and by modulating signalling pathways responsible for protein synthesis  <cit> . various cell models have examined the anabolic potential of the branched chain amino acid , leucine, to stimulate skeletal muscle growth via mammalian target of rapamycin  signalling  <cit> . phosphorylation of mtor complex  <dig>  a rapamycin-sensitive kinase, is vital for downstream activation of phosphokinases required for translational initiation. stimulation of mtor by nutrients or insulin activates p <dig> ribosomal s <dig> kinase , a key mediator of the protein synthesis cascade  <cit> . active p70s6k subsequently leads to phosphorylation of its downstream target, ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase . this results in the translation of messenger rna  which encode for ribosomes and transcription factors, an essential process leading to increased cellular capacity to undergo protein synthesis  <cit> . moreover, mtor-catalysed stimulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4e-binding protein  results in its disassociation from eukaryotic initiation factor 4e . subsequent binding of eif4e to eif4g forms the eif4f translation initiation complex, and allows the recruitment of the 40s ribosomal subunit to the 5'-end of the mrna to initiate protein translation  <cit> .

despite extensive evidence linking leucine with the activation of anabolic signalling  <cit> , the proximal mechanisms by which mtor responds to intracellular levels of leucine remain elusive. to date, several intermediary 'nutrient sensing' molecules, such as those characterised in saccharomyces cerevisiae and bacteria, have been implicated in directing amino acid signalling to mtor  <cit> . the ste- <dig> related mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase  <dig> , activating proteins rag 1- <dig> and class iii phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase vacuolar protein sorting  <dig>  are thought to converge on signalling through mtor in mammalian cells  <cit> . however, recent evidence from rodent models suggests that it is the activity of vps <dig> which is the primary modulator of leucine-stimulated mtor signalling in rat muscle  <cit> . furthermore, it has been previously demonstrated that human vacuolar protein sorting  <dig>  is required for nutrient activation of p70s6k, via mtor signalling  <cit> .

the intricate balance of amino acid influx and efflux in skeletal muscle is maintained by both system a and system l transport proteins, which are responsive to amino acid starvation and hormones  <cit> . sodium coupled neutral amino acid transporter  <dig> , the predominant system a member expressed in human skeletal muscle, is reportedly regulated by both insulin and amino acid deprivation in cultured l <dig> myotubes  <cit> . additionally, leucine exposure following serum withdrawal causes an enhanced rate of uptake of n-methylamino-alpha-isobutyric acid , a system a substrate, by snat <dig>  <cit> . however, it remains unknown whether enhanced uptake by snat <dig> occurs via increased gene transcription, augmented protein synthesis of the amino acid transporter or by increased activity. similarly, system l-type amino acid transporters  have been extensively examined for their possible role in tumour growth, and exhibit a high affinity for bcaa  <cit> . given the extensive evidence describing the potency of bcaa on mtor-driven protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, no studies to date have examined the regulation of lat transporters by amino acids, specifically bcaa. identifying the effectiveness of leucine as a regulator of amino acid transporters within skeletal muscle will provide further insight in the role these proteins play in the control anabolic signalling.

therefore in the present study, a human cell culture model was used to;  compare and contrast the effects of acute and chronic nutrient and hormonal stimulation of anabolic signalling which occurs in skeletal muscle, and  analyse their ability to modulate protein expression of the putative nutrient sensor, hvps <dig>  and gene expression of selected amino acid transporters. it was hypothesised that leucine stimulated phosphorylation of mtor-related signalling kinases would occur together with activation of hvps <dig> and amino acid transporter gene expression.

RESULTS
confirmation of a homogenous primary myotube culture
purity of primary myotube cultures was assessed by immunocytochemical labelling of the muscle cell marker myogenin . a typical purity of 95% was achieved.

leucine and insulin independently regulate mtor signalling
leucine and insulin are known activators of mtor in human skeletal muscle tissue. thus the ability of these stimuli to regulate the expression of phosphorylated mtor both individually and together in human myotubes was assessed . cells treated with leucine or insulin for  <dig> min demonstrated a significant increase in phosphorylated serine mtor following normalisation with total mtor . protein abundance of total mtor did not change following treatment for all timepoints examined . no evidence of synergistic activation of mtor with combined leucine and insulin treatment was evident. conversely, cultures stimulated for  <dig> h displayed increased mtor expression under all treatment conditions, with the greatest increase observed with insulin stimulation . this was found to be maintained with co-treatment of leucine and insulin . at  <dig> h the response was diminished, with only insulin-treated myotubes exhibiting significant increases in mtor phosphorylation , above baseline.

protein abundance of putative nutrient sensing protein, hvps <dig>  is increased in response to leucine and insulin stimulation
it has been previously suggested that the activation of anabolic signalling is mediated through the nutrient-sensing protein, hvps <dig>  in order to investigate whether the bcaa member, leucine, enhances hvps <dig> protein expression, hvps <dig> protein expression was measured in leucine and insulin-stimulated myotubes . immunoblotting revealed that acute exposure  was sufficient to significantly increase hvps <dig> protein abundance in cells treated with leucine alone  and insulin alone . no synergistic effect occurred following co-treatment of leucine and insulin together. similar increases were seen following  <dig> h stimulation of leucine  and insulin  with significant increases in hvps <dig> abundance occurring after co-stimulation of leucine with insulin . hvps <dig> protein expression remained elevated following incubation with leucine alone  and insulin alone  for  <dig> h.

leucine and insulin independently and synergistically regulate p70s6k signalling
activation of the downstream effector, p70s6k , occurred in response to both leucine  and insulin . co-treatment with leucine and insulin resulted in synergistic activation of p70s6k  when normalised to total p70s6k. interestingly, stimulation of leucine alone for  <dig> h did not affect levels of phosphorylated p70s6k on threonine  <dig>  whereas insulin alone did . similar observations occurred when myotubes were chronically treated for  <dig> h with insulin . no activation in response to leucine was detected following  <dig> h treatment.

leucine and insulin induce translation initiation via activation of eif4g
the effect of leucine and insulin on the activation of translation initiation was compared by measuring phosphorylation of eif4g . ser <dig> phosphorylation significantly increased with  <dig> min insulin exposure  but remained unaltered upon exposure to leucine when normalised to total eif4g. contrastingly, exposure to leucine alone for both 3h and  <dig> h, and in combination with insulin, significantly stimulated signalling through eif4g.

insulin but not leucine differentially regulates amino acid transporters
to assess whether members of the system a and l transporter families undergo adaptive regulation following amino acid or insulin treatment, snat <dig>  lat <dig>  lat <dig> and cd98hc gene expression was measured . snat <dig> and lat <dig> mrna expression was not altered by leucine or insulin. conversely, insulin alone or in combination with leucine resulted in a significant down-regulation of lat <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. insulin stimulation for  <dig> h significantly up-regulated cd98hc gene expression , however exposure for  <dig> h caused a significant decrease . lat <dig> mrna expression was unaltered by leucine treatment.

discussion
the aim of this study was to evaluate the anabolic effect of acute and chronic leucine and insulin stimulation in a model of human skeletal muscle. it was important to determine whether leucine could mediate mtor-related signalling via activation of the putative regulator, hvps <dig>  and amino acid transporters. the present work demonstrates the ability of the bcaa member, leucine, to independently stimulate mtor signalling in an experimental model of human skeletal muscle. although p70s6k was only transiently activated by leucine, chronic stimulation resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of the ternary kinase, eif4g. moreover, these data offer an explanation of the molecular mechanism by which amino acids modulate myogenic growth, via activation of the hvps <dig> protein. finally, while exogenous leucine and insulin were sufficient to stimulate anabolic signalling in cultured myotubes, incubation did not alter gene expression of the amino acid transporters measured.

the use of human primary myotubes provides pertinent experimental data on amino acid-mediated anabolic signalling that occurs in human skeletal muscle tissue. cultured muscle cells undergo differentiation to form mature myotubes  <cit>  thus providing a physiologically relevant model to study molecular signalling events which occur in vivo. in agreement with data from rodent studies  <cit> , chinese hamster ovary cells   <cit> , pancreatic beta-cells  <cit>  and rat hepatocytes  <cit> , this study demonstrates for the first time that mtor-related signalling kinases are responsive to a physiological dose of leucine in a human model of skeletal muscle, primary myotubes. however, while mtor was stimulated by insulin on serine residue  <dig>  at all time points measured, the action of leucine was transient  with phosphorylation diminishing after  <dig> min. this is consistent with deldicque et al.  who demonstrated a  <dig> -fold increase in mtor activation within c2c <dig> cells, a model of murine skeletal muscle, following an acute  <dig> min exposure to  <dig> mm leucine  <cit> . however, more recently it was reported that a  <dig> mm dose of leucine also stimulates mtor phosphorylation on ser <dig> by a comparable magnitude  <cit> . the downstream biomarker, p70s6k, followed a similar trend to mtor phosphorylation. while leucine demonstrated transient activation of p70s6k , insulin appeared to stimulate this kinase at all time points. previous work has demonstrated that  <dig> mm leucine stimulates p70s6k activation by 10-fold  <cit>  and a  <dig> mm dose elicits a  <dig> -fold increase  <cit>  within rodent muscle cells. furthermore, cultured pancreatic beta-cells have been shown to respond to  <dig>  mm of leucine, therefore the stimulatory effect of leucine on the phosphorylation state of p70s6k may be specific to the cell model employed where by different cell types have a varying dose-response to amino acids  <cit> . previous in vitro experiments demonstrates the synergistic activation of p70s6k in fao cells treated with a combination of amino acids with insulin  <cit> . results obtained from the current study did not exhibit an additive effect of leucine and insulin, despite utilising the same insulin concentration. while these experiments were conducted using leucine only, the former study used a mixture of amino acids. furthermore, recent evidence suggests that while the activation of anabolic signalling is indeed mtor-dependent, amino acids may signal through the rag complex to activate mtorc <dig> while insulin requires the ras homolog enriched in brain  component to regulate anabolic signalling  <cit> . moreover, it has also been previously shown that deletion of the ser <dig> phosphorylation site on mtor did not affect mtor activity and was not required for the downstream phosphorylation of phas- <dig>  or p70s6k in human embryonic kidney cells  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that while mtor phosphorylation in this study was transient, the downstream activation of p70s6k and eif4g may occur through an independent signalling mechanism and requires further research.

surprisingly, phosphorylation of eif4g occurred following  <dig> h and  <dig> h treatment of leucine and insulin. given that activation of eif4g is a necessary step during formation of the translation initiation complex which is involved in cap dependent translation  <cit> , activation by leucine indicates that protein synthesis may be initiated without insulin.

hvps <dig> is postulated to be a nutrient modulator responsible for signalling to mtor. recently, amino acid regulation of this class iii pi <dig> kinase has been investigated in murine myotubes  <cit> , hepg <dig> and cho cells  <cit> . during states of amino acid starvation, hvps <dig> demonstrates reduced function. however, this is restored with the re-addition of amino acids  <cit> . furthermore, previous reports demonstrate that endogenous expression of hvps <dig> is unresponsive to  <dig> μm insulin  <cit> . unlike these studies, human primary muscle cells demonstrated increased hvps <dig> protein abundance following acute and chronic stimulation of leucine with and without  <dig> nm insulin. the response of hvps <dig> to insulin in cultured myotubes may reflect the physiological need of skeletal muscle for insulin-mediated glucose uptake and for muscle anabolism  <cit> . limited studies have investigated the factors regulating hvps <dig> expression; however the possibility of cross-talk with insulin signalling requires further analysis.

both system a and l solute carriers may regulate intracellular amino acid bioavailability within skeletal muscle  <cit> . the activity of system a transporters has been previously demonstrated to be insulin responsive cultured adipocytes, liver and rat muscle cells  <cit> .

however, in cultured human myotubes both acute and chronic stimulation with insulin failed to increase snat <dig> and lat <dig> gene expression. it is important to note that the aforementioned studies used supraphysiological doses of insulin, nearly 2-fold greater than the concentration used in the current study. system l transport proteins are essential for the movement of bcaa across the cell membrane of skeletal muscle cells  <cit> . leucine exposure of human cultured primary muscle cells did not exert a change in either lat <dig> or lat <dig> gene expression, despite the specificity of lat <dig> for leucine  <cit> . however, functional expression of lat <dig> requires covalent association with the heavy chain of the cd <dig> antigen  in plasma membranes  <cit> . acute insulin exposure stimulated an increase in cd98hc mrna expression, however longer exposure resulted in suppressed gene expression. the current study aimed to present exploratory data on the regulation of amino acid transporters by leucine. given the physiological need for amino acids in skeletal muscle, further research is required to delineate the factors affecting both the protein expression and cellular localisation of amino acid transporters.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the first evidence that mtor signalling is enhanced in response to an acute stimulation with the proteinogenic amino acid, leucine, within cultured human myotubes. while these actions appear transient at the leucine dose utilised, activation of mtor and p70s6k occurred at physiologically relevant concentrations independently of insulin stimulation. interestingly, activation of mtor signalling by leucine occurred in the absence of changes in the expression of genes encoding both the system a and system l carriers, which are responsible for amino acid transport. thus, additional analyses are required to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling amino acid transporter expression within skeletal muscle. of note was the increased protein expression of hvps <dig>  a putative leucine-sensitive kinase which intersects with mtor. these results demonstrate the need for further clinical analysis to be performed specifically investigating the role of hvps <dig> as a nutrient sensing protein for mtor signalling.
