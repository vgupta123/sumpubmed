BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is one of essential macronutrients required for the normal growth and development of higher plants. plant roots acquire p as phosphate , primarily in the form of h2po4-, from the soil solution  <cit> . although total pi is abundant in many soils, the available pi in the soil solution is commonly  <dig> –  <dig> μm due to its binding to soil mineral surfaces and fixation into organic forms  <cit> . hence, p is one of the unavailable and inaccessible macronutrients in the soil  <cit>  and is often the most limiting mineral nutrient in almost all soils  <cit> . among the fertility constraints to crop production in china, low pi availability is the primary limiting factor  <cit> . pi availability is particularly limiting on the highly weathered acid soils of the tropics and subtropics, in which free iron and aluminum oxides bind native and applied pi into forms unavailable to plants  <cit> . therefore, pi availability is often a major limiting factor for crop production in acid soils  <cit> .

p deficiency affects photosynthesis in many plant species, including tea  o. kuntze)  <cit> , satsuma mandarin   <cit> , pigeon pea   <cit> , soybean  merr.)  <cit> , white clover   <cit> , sugar beet   <cit> , tomato   <cit> , bean   <cit> , maize , sunflower   <cit> . in pigeon pea   <cit>  and tea  <cit> , stomatal closure was at least partly responsible for the decreased photosynthetic rate under p deficiency, because the intercellular co <dig> concentration was decreased. however, the lower co <dig> assimilation in p-deficient leaves of soybean  <cit>  and bean  <cit>  was primarily caused by non-stomatal factors as the lower assimilation rate coincided with an increase of the intercellular co <dig> concentration and the internal to ambient co <dig> concentration ratio, respectively. decreases in the activity and amount of rubisco due to p deficiency have been reported for spinach   <cit> , sunflower  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . however, experiments with sugar beet  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  showed that the effects of p deficiency on photosynthetic rate acted through rubp regeneration rather than rubisco activity. jacob and lawlor  <cit>  concluded that the decreased co <dig> assimilation in p-deficient sunflower and maize leaves was a consequence of a smaller atp content and lower energy charge which limited the production of rubp. a feedback inhibition of photosynthesis has been suggested as a cause of decreased co <dig> assimilation at low p supply  <cit> . however, for tomato plants a decrease in starch accumulation and an increase in oxygen sensitivity of co <dig> fixation with decreasing p supply suggest that feedback limitation is decreased under p deficiency  <cit> . p deficiency may also limit photosynthetic rate by altering leaf chl and protein contents  <cit> . however, the decreased photosynthetic rate under p deficiency was not accompanied by decreased contents of chl and protein per unit leaf area  <cit> .

all oxygenic photosynthetic materials investigated so far using direct, time-resolved fluorescence measurement show the polyphasic rise with the basic steps of o-j-i-p  <cit> . the ojip transient has been found to be a sensitive indicator of photosynthetic electron transport processes  <cit> . the kinetics of the ojip are considered to be determined by changes in the redox state of qa  <cit> , but at the same time, the ojip transient reflects the reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain  <cit> . the oj phase represents the reduction of the acceptor side of psii  <cit> . the ji phase parallels the reduction of the pq-pool  <cit>  and the ip phase represents the fractional reduction of the acceptor side of psi or the last step in the reduction of the acceptor side of psii and the amplitude of the ip phase may be a rough indicator of psi content  <cit> . reports concerning the effects of p deficiency on photosynthetic electron transport activity are some conflicting. abadia et al.  <cit>  reported that low p had no major effect on the structure and function of the photosynthetic electron transport system or on photosynthetic quantum yield of sugar beet leaves. jacob and lawor  <cit>  concluded that in vivo photosynthetic electron transport did not limit photosynthetic capacity in p-deficient sunflower and maize leaves. however, p-deficient citrus exhibited a 6% decrease in fv/fm and a  <dig> % decrease in electron transport rate  <cit> . recently, ripley et al.  <cit>  reported that p deficiency decreased tro/abs , eto/abs of sorghum  moench) leaves, but had no significant effect on electron transport flux per rc . thus, it is not well known how p deficiency affects photosynthetic electron transport in plants.

tea is an evergreen shrub native to china and is cultivated in humid and sub-humid of tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate regions of the world mainly on acid soils  <cit> . p deficiency is frequently observed in tea plantations  <cit> . for this reason, p fertilizers are being used annually in tea plantations in order to raise tea productivity and improve tea quality  <cit> . although salehi and hajiboland  <cit>  investigated the effects of p deficiency on tea growth, p uptake and utilization as well as leaf gas exchange and chl a fluorescence, very little is known about the effects of p deficiency on photosynthetic electron transport, photosynthetic enzymes and carbohydrates of tea leaves. the objective of this study was to determine how p deficiency affects co <dig> assimilation, rubisco, non-structural carbohydrates and photosynthetic electron transport in tea leaves to understand the mechanism by which p deficiency leads to a decrease in co <dig> assimilation.

RESULTS
leaf p content and plant growth characteristics
as p supply decreased, leaf p content decreased curvilinearly . both root and shoot dry weight increased as p supply increased from  <dig> to  <dig> μm, then remained unchanged . the ratio of root/shoot dry weight in the  <dig> to  <dig> μm p-treated trees was higher than in the  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm p-treated ones .

specific leaf weight, chl, car, total soluble protein and n
specific leaf weight did not change significantly as leaf p content decreased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  then dropped significantly in the lowest p leaves . leaf chl , car  and total soluble protein  contents did not change significantly as leaf p decreased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  then decreased with further decreasing leaf p content. leaf n content remained little changed with decreasing leaf p content, except for a decrease in the lowest p leaves . the ratio of chl a/b remained unchanged over the range of leaf p content examined . the ratio of car/chl remained relatively constant as leaf p content decreased, except for an increase in the lowest p leaves .

leaf gas exchange and rubisco
both co <dig> assimilation  and stomatal conductance  increased as leaf p content increased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  then remained relatively stable with further increasing leaf p content, whereas intercellular co <dig> concentration decreased as leaf p content increased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  then did not change significantly with further increasing leaf p content .

on an area basis, both initial and total rubisco activity kept relatively constant as leaf p content decreased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  then decreased with further decreasing leaf p content, whereas both initial and total activity expressed on a protein basis did not change significantly over the range of leaf p content examined, except for a slight decrease in initial activity in the lowest p leaves . rubisco activation state remained unchanged as leaf p content decreased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  and then dropped in the lowest p leaves .

leaf nonstructural carbohydrates
on an area basis, contents of glucose and fructose did not change significantly over the range of leaf p content examined except for a significant increase in the lowest p leaves . contents of sucrose and starch remained little changed as leaf p content decreased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig>  then decreased with further decreasing leaf p content . when expressed on a dry weight basis, sucrose content did not change significantly as leaf p content decreased from  <dig>  mg m- <dig> to  <dig>  mg m- <dig> except for a decrease in the  <dig>  mg m- <dig> and  <dig>  mg m- <dig> p leaves , whereas the other results expressed on a dry weight basis were similar to those expressed on an area basis .

leaf ojip transients and related parameters
all ojip transients showed a typical polyphasic rise with the basic steps of o-j-i-p. ojip transients of leaves from  <dig> and  <dig> μm p-treated trees showed a rise at the o-step and a large depression at the p-step .

fig. 6b and 6e shows the kinetics of relative variable fluorescence at any time vt = / and the differences of normalized p-treated transients minus  <dig> μm p-treated transient . the differences revealed three obvious bands: increase in the k-step , in the  <dig> to  <dig> ms range j-step and in the  <dig> to  <dig> ms range i-step. the positive k-, j- and i-steps were very pronounced in the leaves from  <dig> and  <dig> μm p-treated trees. fig. 6c and 6f depicts the relative variable fluorescence between fo and f <dig> μs  and the differences of normalized p-treated transients minus  <dig> μm p-treated transient . the differences showed a clear l-step. ojip transients from  <dig> to  <dig> μm p-treated trees had decreased maximum amplitude of ip phase and rise time, and the end-levels were lowered by p deficiency .

fig.  <dig> depicts the behavior patterns of  <dig> fluorescence parameters. for each parameter the values were normalized on that of the sample treated with  <dig> μm p. generally speaking, leaves from  <dig> to  <dig> μm p-treated plants had decreased eto/tro, reo/eto, tro/abs, eto/abs, reo/abs , tro/cso, rc/cso, eto/cso, reo/cso , reo/rc, eco/rc, maximum amplitude of ip phase, piabs and pitot, abs , but increased dio/rc, dio/cso and dio/abs  .

leaf maximum amplitude of ip phase, piabs and pitot, abs in relation to co <dig> assimilation
leaf co <dig> increased linearly or curvilinearly with increasing maximum amplitude of ip phase , piabs  and pitot, abs , respectively.

discussion
our results showed that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm p treatments decreased root and shoot dry weight , and foliar p content for the three treatments was lower than the sufficiency range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg g- <dig> dw  <cit> . in addition, nearly all physiological and biochemical activities reached their maximum in the leaves of about  <dig> mg m- <dig> from  <dig> μm p-treated trees . based on these results, trees treated with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μm p are considered p deficient. p deficiency resulted in an increase in the ratio of root/shoot dry weight , as previously observed in different plant species growing under different growth conditions  <cit> . the increase of the root/shoot dry weight ratio in response to p deficiency may be associated with stronger sink competition of the roots for p and photosynthates  <cit> .

despite decreased co <dig> assimilation, p deficiency causes increased starch content and decreased sucrose content in leaves of several plant species including soybean  <cit> , tobacco   <cit> , spinach, barley   <cit>  and brachiaria hybrid  <cit> . increased partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the starch at the expense of sucrose synthesis in leaves  <cit>  and decreased demand from growth  <cit>  have been shown to contribute to increased starch accumulation in p-deficient leaves. however, a simultaneous increase in starch and sucrose contents in the leaves of p-deficient soya  merr.)  <cit> , bean  <cit>  and sugar beet  <cit>  plants has been observed while chloroplastic and leaf levels of sugar phosphates decreased markedly  <cit> . in our study, p-deficient leaves had decreased sucrose  and starch  contents, as previously found for trifoliate orange  raf.), swingle citrumelo , carrizo citrange  osb. × p. trifoliata)  <cit>  and rice   <cit> . there appears to be considerable variation in the responses of leaf carbohydrate metabolism during p deficiency. some of the variation may result from different degree of p deficiency, time of exposure to p deficiency, plant species, light intensities used in different studies  <cit> . it is noteworthy that specific leaf weight decreased in the lowest p leaves . this contrasts with previous data obtained for soybean  <cit>  and sugar beet  <cit> , whose leaves accumulated starch under p deficiency  <cit> . regressive analysis showed that specific leaf weight decreased linearly with decreasing leaf starch content expressed on a leaf area basis . therefore, the decrease in specific leaf weight under p deficiency may be explained, at least in part, by the decrease in starch content.

the higher intercellular co <dig> concentration in p-deficient leaves indicates that the low co <dig> assimilation under p deficiency  is primarily caused by non-stomatal factors, as earlier reported for soybean  <cit>  and bean  <cit> . however, salehi and hajiboland  <cit>  proposed that lower stomatal conductance was the main cause for the decreased co <dig> assimilation rate in p-deficient tea leaves as the decrease in assimilation rate was accompanied by a decrease in the intercellular co <dig> concentration. similar result has been obtained for pigeon pea   <cit> .

it has been suggested that low sink demand limits photosynthesis under p deficiency  <cit> . in our study, however, the decrease of assimilation co <dig> rate under p deficiency was accompanied by a decrease in the starch accumulation , as previously reported for tomato grown in high light  <cit> . this indicates that the production, rather that the utilization of photosynthates, is limiting. evidence shows that soluble sugars, specifically hexoses, may repress photosynthetic gene expression, particularly of the nuclear-encoded small sub-unit of rubisco, thus decreasing rubisco content and co <dig> assimilation  <cit> . the lack of accumulation of sucrose and hexoses in the leaves from  <dig> and  <dig> μm p-treated trees  means that the feedback repression mechanism via accumulation of soluble sugars does not play a major role in determining the activity of rubisco and the rate of co <dig> assimilation in these leaves. however, this is not to deny that the decrease in co <dig> assimilation in the lowest p leaves can be due to the accumulation of hexoses, because the levels of glucose + fructose observed was higher than the reported threshold level  for hexose regulation of gene expression in tobacco  <cit> . the decrease in initial and total rubisco activity expressed on an area basis in response to p deficiency was probably not the primary factor limiting co <dig> assimilation, because there was a greater decrease in co <dig> assimilation than in rubisco activity . in our study, the observed lower initial and total rubisco activity expressed on an area basis in p-deficient leaves could be associated with decreased total soluble protein content , because both initial and total activity expressed on a protein basis did not change significantly over the range of leaf p content examined, except for a slight decrease in the initial activity in the lowest p leaves . the decrease in co <dig> assimilation in p-deficient leaves cannot be attributed to a decrease in chl and protein contents, because the decrease in leaf chl  and total soluble protein  contents was much less than co <dig> assimilation . similar results have been reported for spinach  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit> , and bean  <cit> .

the presence of a positive l-step at ca.  <dig> μs in p-deficient leaves  means that the ojip transients from p-deficient leaves are less sigmoidal than from p-sufficient ones and that the psii units are less grouped or less energy is being exchanged between the independent ps ii units. because the grouped conformation is more stable than the ungrouped one, the decreased grouping implies that the psii units of p-deficient leaves have lost stability and become more fragile. similar results have been reported for n-deficient cowpea   <cit>  and al-treated citrus grandis  osbeck  <cit> .

the decrease of fv/fm in p-deficient leaves was caused by both a decrease in fm and an increase in fo , as previously found for tea  <cit> , satsuma mandarin  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit> . the decrease in fv/fm under stress is considered to reflect the photoinhibitory damage to psii complexes  <cit> . the higher fo may be caused by both the damage of oec and the inactivation of some of the psii rcs  <cit> , because p-deficient leaves had decreased rc/cso  and increased damage to oec, or it may be related to the accumulation of reduced qa  <cit> , because the physiological fractional reduction of qa to qa -, as indicated by the increase in mo , increased in p-deficient leaves. quenching of fm in p-deficient leaves may arise from the photoinhibitory quenching , because an increase in fo with a quenched fm was observed in p-deficient leaves   <cit>  and from the xanthophyll cycle-dependent thermal energy dissipation, which was significantly higher in p-deficient satsuma mandarin leaves than in p-sufficient ones  <cit> .

the j-step, i-step and ip phase of ojip transients are correlated with the redox state of qa, the redox state of plastoquinone, and the redox state of end acceptors at psi electron acceptor side, respectively  <cit> . the finding that p-deficient leaves had increased vj and vi , but decreased maximum amplitude of ip phase  suggests that acceptor side of psii became more reduced under p deficiency, but the acceptor side of psi become more oxidized. p deficiency-induced photoinhibitory damage at psii acceptor is also supported by the fact that fv  was decreased in p-deficient leaves along with an increase in fo , which is the characteristic of photoinhibitory damage at psii acceptor side  <cit> . a positive k-step appeared at ca.  <dig> μs in the ojip transients in p-deficient leaves. this means that the oxygen evolving complex  is damaged  <cit> . a positive k-step has also been found in n-deficient cowpea leaves  <cit> .

our result showed that p deficiency decreased the total electron carriers per rc , the yields , eto/tro, reo/eto, eto/abs, and reo/abs; fig. 7a), the fluxes  and the fractional reduction of the psi end electron acceptors, as indicated by the decreased maximum amplitude of ip phase , and damaged all of the photochemical and non-photochemical redox reactions, as indicated by the decreases in piabs and pitot, abs . this means that leaves from p-deficient trees have a decreased capacity for electron transport, thus limiting atp synthesis and rubp regeneration. lacking atp has the consequence that rubisco is not fully activated  <cit> . this might partly explain why p-deficient leaves had lower rubisco activity and activation state . regressive analysis showed that co <dig> assimilation decreased linearly or curvilinearly with decreasing maximum amplitude of ip phase , piabs  and pitot, abs , respectively. therefore, we conclude that the decreased photosynthetic electron transport capacity, in conjunction with the lack of atp which limit rubp regeneration are probably the main factors contributing to decreased co <dig> assimilation under p deficiency.

because p-deficient leaves only utilized a small fraction of the absorbed light energy in photosynthetic electron transport, as indicated by the decreases in eco/rc, eto/abs and reo/abs , compared with the p-sufficient ones, more excess excitation energy existed in p-deficient than in p-sufficient leaves in high light. correspondingly, energy dissipation, as indicated by dio/cso, dio/rc, and dio/abs , increased in p-deficient leaves . in addition to this, the excess absorbed light in turn can lead to the production of 1o <dig> and reduced active oxygen species, causing damage to photosynthetic apparatus and cell structure  <cit> . indeed, photoinhibitory damage to both donor side and acceptor side has been demonstrated to increase the production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
p deficiency decreased photosynthetic electron transport capacity by impairing the whole electron transport chain from the psii donor side up to the psi, thus decreasing atp content which limits rubp regeneration, and hence, the rate of co <dig> assimilation. in addition to decrease light absorption by lowering chl content, energy dissipation is enhanced to protect p-deficient leaves from photo-oxidative damage in high light.
