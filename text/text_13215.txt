BACKGROUND
large scale projects aimed at the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumors onset and progression play a crucial role to improve clinicians ability to treat cancer  <cit> . the huge amount of data produced by these research projects yielded to the development of specialized data repositories enabling researchers to mine effectively cancer expression related data like oncomine  <cit> , and to collect and organize information about the gene expression profiles of normal, pre-cancer, and cancer cells as in the case of the cancer genome anatomy project . cancer specific gene expression data can also be found in the gene expression omnibus  repository  <cit> . the availability of this unprecedented volume of data has, on the one hand, the potential to boost the research focused on the elucidation of the molecular basis of cancer and, on the other hand, to accelerate the development of novel cancer therapies.

even if novel bio-technologies, such as next generation sequencing and epigenetic pattern analysis, have been recently applied to cancer research  <cit> , a fundamental contribution in this research area is still due to the application of gene expression profiling. this technique proved to be effective for the classification of diverse types of tumors  <cit> , for the prediction of patients outcome  <cit>  and the prediction of the response to chemotherapies  <cit> .

by exploiting gene expression profiling, segal and colleagues constructed a functional module map for cancers to investigate commonalities and variations between different types of tumor  <cit> . the novelty of their approach lies in the analysis of expression profiles for the identification of sets of genes that act in concert to carry out specific functions in different cancer types, and in the construction of a module map constituted by a collection of the gene sets associated to specific cancer gene modules . the rationale behind this approach is that the comparison of molecular profiles can reveal both the existence of specific patterns  and the biological behavior of distinct tumor types, without the need to integrate other sources of information, such as gene regulatory networks or molecular pathways, known to be relevant for the molecular characterization of cancer.

despite the identification of cancer modules based on a single type of molecular evidence reduces the complexity of the problem, this approach introduces also serious limitations. indeed the cms are identified considering only transcriptional signatures, but it is commonly accepted that some of the aberrations leading to cancer onset and driving their progression do not occur at transcription level  <cit> . a second and more important limitation regards the interpretability of cms: being derived from transcriptional data only, the functional interpretation of the cms cannot be easily translated into a wider biological context, since other molecular processes, ranging from post-transcriptional to translational and post-translational events may finely regulate the final product of genes. for instance, gene transcripts must be translated into proteins by the ribosomes and misregulations of this important process can contribute to several diseases, including cancer  <cit> .

as a consequence, gene expression data alone, even if fundamental to identify cms, cannot detect genes involved, for instance, in post-transcriptional misregulated processes underlying cancer. to this end we need other sources of data  to confirm cms identified mainly through transcriptional data, and to discover novel genes, not detectable with gene expression profiling, related to the molecular pathology of tumors.

in this contribution we test the hypothesis that the cms published in  <cit>  can be predicted through network-based algorithms using different sources of functional interaction data, not limited to correlations between expression profiles. to this end we integrated functional interaction networks derived from reactome and other curated databases, and from uncurated pairwise relationships , from protein complexes and from comparative genomics techniques  <cit> . moreover we propose a novel algorithm to rank genes with respect to their potential membership to each specific cm. the different ranking methods proposed in the literature in general exploit local or global learning strategies to properly rank genes/nodes in a biomolecular network  <cit> . in this paper we propose a ranking method that combines both local and global learning strategies to exploit both "local" similarities between genes and "global" similarities embedded in the topology of the network. indeed our proposed kernelized score functions adopt both local learning strategies based on a generalized notion of distance in a universal reproducing kernel hilbert space, and global learning strategies based on the choice of proper graph kernels to exploit the overall topology of the underlying biological network. moreover our proposed approach is modular and extensible, in the sense that different variants of both local and global learning strategies can be chosen to design different gene ranking algorithms. our networks-based algorithms are not only able to recover the cms by using functional networks resulting from different sources of biomolecular data, but in perspective they could be also applied to discover novel genes involved in the onset and progression of tumors related to specific cms.

methods
in this section at first we describe the cancer gene modules  proposed in  <cit>  and the functional interaction networks used in our experiments to rank genes according to their likelihood to belong to specific cms. then we propose a fast semi-supervised machine learning method based on kernelized score functions to rank genes with respect to cancer modules: the proposed approach adopts both local and global learning strategies able to exploit different notions of functional similarity between genes and the overall functional relationships between genes encoded in the topology of the network. we also briefly summarize two state-of-art semi-supervised machine learning methods for node ranking in biomolecular networks, i.e. the genemania  <cit> , and the labprop algorithms  <cit> , and finally we introduce the integration techniques adopted to combine the functional interaction networks.

all the methods described below process an undirected weighted graph g = <v, e >, where v is the set of vertices representing genes and e the set of edges representing functional similarity between pairs of genes. for the sake of simplicity we denote with v ∈ v both a vertex of the graph and the corresponding associated gene. w is the corresponding adjacency matrix with elements wij representing the "strength" of the similarity between vertices vi, vj ∈ v, and vc ⊂ v is a subset of genes belonging to a given cancer module.

cancer gene modules
the cms  <cit>  were obtained from the molecular signatures database, msigdb  <cit>  , set name: cm cancer modules). in  <cit>  segal and colleagues investigated the expression profiles of  <dig> genes in  <dig> arrays spanning  <dig> clinical categories represented by several types of tumour. to this end the authors collected  <dig> publicly available gene sets and identified the arrays in which each gene set shows an expression signature  of a consistent part of the genes belonging to the considered gene set. problems due to consistent overlaps between the signatures associated to different gene sets were solved by clustering the gene sets on the basis of their core signatures. this led to the definition of  <dig> statistically significant gene sets called modules by the authors . in the second step of their analysis the authors used these modules to characterize clinical conditions associated to the arrays, according to the combination of modules that are activated and deactivated. this work has the merit to be among the first that tried to investigate commonalities and variations between different types of tumour in terms of sets of altered functional gene modules.

functional interactions networks
in this section we describe the functional gene networks used in our tests and the reasons motivating their usage with respect to the prediction of the cms identified in  <cit> . we used both protein-protein and domain-domain interaction networks enforced through the predictions of a classifier  <cit> , and functional interaction networks constructed with comparative genomics techniques  <cit> .

computationally predicted functional protein interaction network
in  <cit>  wu and colleagues constructed a functional protein interaction network  based on functional interactions predicted by a naive bayes classifier  trained on pairwise relationships extracted from reactome  <cit>  and other curated pathways databases, and from uncurated pairwise relationships derived from physical protein-protein interactions  in human and other species, from gene co-expression data, proteins domain-domain interactions, protein interactions obtained via biomedical text mining, and gene ontology annotations. the constructed network was then applied to the study of several types of tumors .

the rationale behind this approach is that the usage of a classifier able to predict the occurrence of a true functional interaction  can be exploited in the construction of a functional interaction network that combines high-coverage unreliable pairwise interactions datasets with low-coverage highly reliable pathway-based functional interactions. this network was used in our experiments because the classifier trained on many and diverse datasets can embed in the predicted functional interaction links not only information derived from human gene co-expression data but also from protein-protein and protein domain-domain interactions.

comparative genomics based enrichment of functional interaction networks
similar in spirit to the approach in  <cit> , the functional network construction method presented in  <cit>  by lee and colleagues integrates diverse lines of evidence in order to produce a functional human gene network  that has then been used in several tests to predict causal genes for human diseases and to increase the power of genome-wide association studies. humannet and fi networks include different sources of functional interaction evidences: e.g. protein domain-domain interactions data are not involved in the construction of humannet and data about protein complexes are not considered in the construction of the fi network.

the most significant difference between the two networks consists in the inclusion in humannet of functional interactions borrowed from other species through comparative genomics techniques: functional interactions have been propagated from yeast, fly and worm to human by means of a comparative genomics approach presented in  <cit>  and previously validated in other species  <cit> .

score functions based on kernelized similarity measures
kernelized score functions are based on: a) score functions that generalize the guilt-by-association approach  <cit>  by introducing different functions to quantify the similarity between a gene and its neighbours in a biomolecular network; b) an extended notion of similarity between genes implemented through kernels embedded in the score functions. the approach is modular, in the sense that the score functions are designed for general kernels, and specific kernels can be applied or specifically designed to represent similarities between genes connected in functional networks. the proposed algorithm is fast and scales well with large functional networks. a schematic overview of the proposed procedure is depicted in figure  <dig> 

more precisely, by this approach we can derive score functions s: v → ℝ+ based on properly chosen kernel functions, by which we can directly rank vertices according to the values of s: the higher the score, the higher the likelihood that a gene belongs to a given cancer module. from this standpoint our approach is related to, and can be considered an extension of a method recently proposed in the different context of gene function prediction from synthetic lethality networks  <cit> .

the score functions are built on distance measures defined in a suitable hilbert space ℋ and computed using the usual "kernel trick", by which instead of explicitly computing the inner product < φ , φ  > in the hilbert space, with φ: v → ℋ, we compute the associated kernel function k: v × v → ℝ+ in the original input space v . let be d a suitable distance measure in the hilbert space between a given vertex/gene v and the set of genes vc belonging to a specific cancer module. we chose three different distance measures:

  dav=1|vc|∑x∈vc||ϕ-ϕ|| <dig> 

  dnn=minx∈vc||ϕ-ϕ|| <dig> 

  dknn= ∑x∈ik||ϕ-ϕ|| <dig> 

where ik in  represents the first ranked k vertices x ∈ vc according to k. these distances represent respectively the average, the nearest-neighbors and the k-nearest-neighbors distance in ℋ of the vertex v w.r.t. the set of vertices vc. from these distances we can derive three score measures, respectively the average score, the nearest neighbours and the k-nearest neighbours scores.

average score. by developing the square in  we obtain:

  dav=<ϕ,ϕ>+1|vc|∑x∈vc<ϕ,ϕ>-2|vc|∑x∈vc<ϕ,ϕ> 

by recalling that <φ, φ >= k, to obtain a similarity measure we need only to change the sign of :

  simav=-k+2|vc|∑x∈vck-1|vc|∑x∈vck 

by observing that the third term of  is equal for all v ∈ v , we can obtain the following average score sav:

  sav=-k+2|vc|∑x∈vck 

note that if all k are equal for all v, we can further simplify  by removing its first term.

nearest-neighbours score. if instead of considering the average distance  between a vertex v and vc, we consider the minimum distance between v and vc in the feature space , we can derive in a similar way the similarity measure simnn:

  simnn=-minx∈vc 

if k is equal for all x ∈ v, we can simplify , thus achieving the nearest neighbours score snn:

  snn=-minx∈vc-2k=2 max x∈vck 

k-nearest-neighbours score. a natural extension of the snn score can be derived from the k-nearest neighbours distance  of a vertex v from the set of nodes vc, thus obtaining the k-nearest neighbours score sknn:

  sknn= <dig> ∑x∈ikk 

any valid kernel k can be applied to compute the above proposed scores, but in the context of cancer module gene ranking, we used random walk kernels  <cit> , since they can capture the similarity between genes, taking into account the topology of the overall functional interaction network. given a symmetric adjacency matrix w of the functional interaction undirected graph g, the one-step random walk kernel is:

  k=i+d-12wd- <dig> 

where k is the gram matrix associated to the random walk kernel function, whose elements kij correspond to the values k of the kernel function, i is the identity matrix, d is a diagonal matrix with elements dii= ∑jwij, and a is a value larger than  <dig> 

in our experiments we applied q-step random walk kernels k q-step = kq, by varying the number of steps q  <cit> . in this way we can explicitly evaluate the direct neighbors of each gene , but also its undirected neighbors . in other words, by setting q =  <dig> or q =  <dig> two vertices are considered similar if they are directly connected or if they are connected through a path including one or two vertices. in principle also longer paths could be considered, but this could introduce too remote similarities between genes, yielding a potential high level of noise in the prediction of cancer module genes.

it is worth noting that vavien, a recently proposed method applied to the gene ranking problem with respect to omim diseases using protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> , shares some ideas, but also shows significant differences with our approach. the general setting of the problem is similar, but the realization of the score function is very different: the vavien algorithm proposes a simple correlation measure between topological profiles and the average profiles of genes known to belong to a specific omim class, while we propose different score functions, based on different notions of distance, and the average distance that resembles the vavien average profile is realized in a more general hilbert space, and represents only one of the possible distances that can be considered. from this standpoint our approach could be considered a generalization of vavien: our method is not restricted to the classical correlation measure to model the similarity between genes, but different notions of similarity can be realized through the proper choice of a kernel function: the correlation can be applied by using a correlation kernel  <cit> , but other kernels representing different notions of similarity between genes, , can be embedded in the score functions to rank genes.

genemania
genemania  <cit>  is a variant of the semi-supervised learning algorithm originally proposed by zhou et al.  <cit> , by which, adopting a "gaussian smoothing" approach labels associated to the vertices can be propagated to rank the unlabeled vertices of the network. similarly to the previous method, genemania finds a score s for each vi ∈ v , according to their likelihood to belong to a given class vc, by minimizing the following objective function:

  s*=arg min sα∑i2+ ∑i∑jwij <dig> 

where s is the vector of the scores associated to the genes, s <dig> is the initial vector of scores reflecting the a priori knowledge about the investigated genes, si and si <dig> their ith components, and wij are the elements of the adjacency matrix w of the graph g connecting the genes. note that eq.  is the convex combination  of two terms, where the first one minimizes the error between predicted and a priori known scores, while the second assures the "internal coherence" of the network, by penalizing connected genes  having different scores. equation  can be solved in closed form or through efficient iterative algorithms . genemania, originally proposed to predict gene functions, differs from the original zhou algorithm since it introduces a simple but effective cost-sensitive technique , and moreover applies a novel weighted integration technique  <cit>  .

label propagation 
the zhu et al. labelprop   <cit>  algorithm minimizes an objective function that resembles the previously described zhou et al. algorithm:

  s*=arg mins ∑i∑jwij <dig> 

eq.  corresponds to the second summation of eq. , that assures an "internal coherence" of the computed score . the coherence w.r.t. the initial score s <dig> is assured by not allowing any change of the scores si for the vertices vi ∈ vc during the label propagation process, that is the predicted scores si are set to si <dig> for each vi ∈ vc. also this algorithm can be implemented both in closed form, or through iterative techniques.

networks integration
to integrate the fi and the humannet networks, we summed their corresponding adjacency matrices, previously normalized according to a laplacian graph normalization, thus assuring the symmetry of the resulting normalized matrix  <cit> . this method has been applied to integrate the data with all the methods, but with genemania we also used the sw algorithm, since it has been introduced as part of an enhanced version of genemania  <cit> . in brief, sw integrated the networks according to a weighted sum strategy, i.e. through a weighted sum of the corresponding adjacency matrices w:

  w*= ∑iwiw 

the weights wi are computed simultaneously for all the considered classes by solving efficiently a single ridge regression problem  <cit> .

RESULTS
after introducing the general set-up of the experiments, we at first show that our proposed kernelized score functions can successfully rank genes with respect to cms, using different sources of functional interaction data, i.e. the fi and humannet functional networks , even if cms are defined mainly in terms of over or underexpressed sets of genes. then we compare our proposed kernelized score functions with several state-of-the-art network-based gene ranking methods, using both separated fi and humannet data and an integrated data set constructed by combining the two functional networks. finally, we show that our methods could be applied to discover novel genes associated to specific cancer types, by analyzing whether top ranked "false positive" genes for the cm  <dig>  are actually involved in the onset and progression of types of cancer related to cm  <dig> 

experimental set-up
the genes belonging to the cms defined in]  <cit>  were filtered in order to ensure the presence of at least one functional interaction in both the fi and humannet networks : this led to the definition of a final collection of  <dig> human genes. we then removed each cancer module annotated with less than  <dig> genes, since our aim consists in assuring reliable predictions and in showing the feasibility of our approach, obtaining a final set of cms composed of  <dig> distinct modules.

for each cm we ranked the genes with respect to their likelihood to belong to the core set of genes annotated to the considered module. performance evaluation was realized following a canonical 5-folds stratified cross-validation  scheme repeated  <dig> times. performances were collected in terms of precision at fixed recall levels . we also computed the area under the roc curve  for each cm. the results were averaged across the cv folds and the repetitions of the experiment. we finally registered the computational times required by each method for the completion of the entire experiment.

ranking of genes using multi-source functional interaction networks
we designed a set of experiments to show that cms are predictable using sources of data not limited to gene expression profiles. more precisely our aim consists in showing that we can rank genes with respect to a specific cancer module using protein-protein or domain-domain interaction data included in the fi network, or by using other functional interaction data obtained through comparative genomics techniques as the ones included in the humannet networks . to this end, according to the experimental set-up described in the previous sections, we applied our newly proposed kernelized score functions snn, sknn and sav, using  <dig>   <dig> and 3-steps random walk kernels. auc results presented in figure  <dig> show that the proposed methods are able to rank genes with respect to cancer modules using functional interaction networks constructed with different sources of biomolecular data: independently of the score function and the kernel adopted, the auc values with humannet are always significantly larger than  <dig>  for most of the  <dig> cms. similar results are obtained also with the fi functional network . these results are also confirmed by the precision-recall curves averaged across the  <dig> cms , that show that the kernelized score functions can reasonably learn the cancer modules using fi and humannet networks.

the proper choice of the optimal number of random walk steps for the kernelized score functions is of critical importance in order to obtain good performances. as we can see in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  independently of the choice of the kernelized score function and of the considered functional interaction network, the best performance in terms of precisions at fixed recall levels is obtained with 2-steps random walk kernels. auc results show that 2-steps random walk kernels are the optimal choice also with respect to this metric . we thus decided to use only kernelized score functions based on 2-steps random walk kernel in the subsequent analyses. the choice of the optimal number of neighbours  was tuned by internal cross validation. we repeated the entire experiment  by varying k between  <dig> and  <dig>  by averaging across classes, we found that optimal average results  are obtained with k =  <dig>  the a parameter of the kernel functions  has been set to  <dig> for all the ranking tasks, after a preliminary evaluation of other values. it is worth noting that both the score functions  and the parameters of random walk kernels  can be tuned e.g. by internal cross validation separately for each cm. this is a computationally intensive approach that could yield to better results, but in principle it could be feasible considering that the proposed kernelized score functions are very fast .

the results show that functional similarities encoded in interaction networks are thus useful to rank genes with respect to cancer modules. in particular, direct and indirect neighbours  are on the average the most informative to correctly rank genes. indeed 2-steps random walk kernels take into account both direct links and nodes with path length equal to  <dig>  to rank genes. if we include in the score evaluation also nodes with path length equal to  <dig> on the average we can observe a certain decay in performance. a larger decay is observed with 4-steps random walk kernels . these results show that similarities mediated through direct common neighbours  are the on the average the most informative to predict cms. loose similarities, represented by connections between genes mediated through two or more other genes may add noise to the learning process, thus resulting in reduced performance.

we need meaningful networks constructed with informative functional interactions between genes to correctly rank genes according to cms. for instance, we hypothesize that simple go annotations to construct similarity networks between genes are not enough to predict whether a gene may belong to a specific cancer module. to test this hypothesis we evaluated the performances obtained by ranking the genes using directly as input a network based on go functional annotations shared between genes. using sav with a  <dig> steps random walk kernel we obtained an average precision close to 0: <dig> at recall  <dig> , and this value decreases from recall 0: <dig> to 1: <dig> . the poor performance obtained with networks constructed from go annotations were also confirmed by auc results, very close to  <dig> , indicating, in practice, absence of learning. these results are consistent with the process of definition of the cms, since even if many of them are composed of subsets of one or more gene sets corresponding to functional classes as encoded by go or other functional annotations repositories, cm design policies require that all the members of the signatures constituting the core of a cm must be up or down regulated  <cit> .

comparison of kernelized score functions with other gene ranking methods
we compared our proposed kernelized score functions sav , snn  and sknn   with other semi-supervised machine learning methods for gene ranking in biomolecular networks: genemania  <cit> , the semi-supervised network-based method proposed by zhou and others  <cit>  , and the label propagation method , proposed in  <cit>  . results are presented separately for the three functional interaction networks .

results using fi and humannet networks
when using the functional relationships encoded in the fi network , genemania performs slightly better than all the other compared methods, with the exception of precisions from  <dig>  to  <dig>  recall levels, where results are very close to those obtained by sav and sknn. the zhou method  performs worse than genemania, sav and sknn in terms of precision, but better than snn. the worst performance in terms of precision was obtained by labelprop. all the precision curves share the same trend  with the exception of the curve of labelprop which shows a maximum at recall  <dig> .

when using the relationships encoded in the humannet network , the best precisions at recall ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were obtained by sav and sknn while the best precision in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  recall range are obtained by genemania. the precisions of sav, sknn and genemania are constantly above the ones of the other methods. also with this dataset labelprop confirmed its poor performance: the main reasons of these results depend on both the nature of this algorithm and the characteristics of the functional interaction networks. indeed labelprop propagates the initial labeling to all the network by performing multiple iterations of the label propagation before to converge to a stable solution. in this way the algorithm explores also nodes very far from the core of the initial positive nodes, and genes are considered similar even when paths connecting them are relatively long; as a consequence, two genes become "similar" when their functional similarities are relatively loose, thus introducing noise in the transductive process of gene ranking with respect to the cms.

results using the integrated functional interaction network
the fi and humannet networks contain complementary information . we thus produced an integrated network simply by summing their adjacency matrices and we repeated our ranking experiments. compared precision performances are depicted in figure  <dig>  while the averaged aucs obtained by each method in the ranking tasks performed using the three functional networks are reported in figure  <dig> 

the best performing methods at low recall levels are sav and sknn, indicating that in the investigated ranking tasks they are the choice of election when relatively high precisions are required by the application domain . when we use the integrated network, the precisions of sav and sknn lie above  the ones obtained by genemania from 0: <dig> to 0: <dig> recall values and are slightly worse at recall  <dig>  and  <dig>  in terms of precision at low recall levels sav outperforms sknn: this holds until recall  <dig> . it is worth noting that in this context precision at relatively low recall level is more significant, since to assess by wet-based experiments whether top ranked "false positive" genes are associated to a specific tumor, we would like to know in advance that positive predictions are actually positive , since usually wet-based experiments can be expensive in terms of costs and time. moreover at very high recall level the precision is too low to be useful in practice .

according to the expectation that the information encoded by the fi and humannet networks are, at least in part, not overlapping, the ranking performances obtained with the integrated network are better than those obtained using either of the two component functional networks for sav and sknn. it should be noticed that with genemania we performed also a weighted combination, according to the procedures described in  <cit>  , but the results are statistically indistinguishable from that obtained with the simpler unweighted integration, and have been not reported in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  indeed, the weights assigned to fi and humannet are approximately equal, and the resulting integrated network is very close to that obtained through the unweighted sum.

to assess the potential impact of the cardinality of the cms on the performance of the compared methods, we analyzed the precision at  <dig>  recall and the auc for cms grouped by cardinality . kernelized score functions achieve the best results among the compared methods for the groups  and , that is the groups including the cms with a low or a relatively low number of genes, independently of the considered performance measure. moreover our proposed method obtains the best auc also for the group . on the contrary genemania achieves the best results for the group including cms with the largest number of genes, but note that sknn achieves comparable results also in the " <dig> and more" group of cms. among the four cardinality groups the first one  accounts for about 70% of the  <dig> cms involved in our experimental setting, while each of the remaining cardinality groups covers about 10% of the  <dig> cms.

summarizing, results with integrated functional interaction networks show that the combined local and global learning strategies embedded in kernelized score functions lead to significantly better results that those achieved by other compared methods. moreover a fine tuning of the choice of the score functions and of the kernel parameters for each cm could yield to even better results.

time required for each of the compared methods for the realization of the entire experiment . times are expressed in seconds.

the proposed approach is very fast, since no model learning is required, but only a computation of scores based on kernelized distances: once the kernel matrix has been computed, the score computation has a complexity o, that is approximately linear when the number of "positive" nodes is largely lower than the overall number of vertices. in our experiments the number of genes in cancer modules is between  <dig> and about  <dig>  while the number of the overall genes is larger than  <dig>  hence, in this setting our algorithm is approximately linear with respect to the number of genes.

a preliminary application to the discovery of novel genes involved in the onset and progression of cancer
since genes associated to cms are detectable using also data different from simple expression, we hypothesize that mining more general functional interaction networks we could extract genes that are functionally related to cms, but whose functional interactions are lost during the construction of the expression signature. if this hypothesis is true, we expect that the top "false positive" ranked genes associated to a given cm are on the one hand functionally coherent, that is involved in the same set  of biological processes, and on the other hand pathologically coherent . a thorough analysis of these topics is beyond the scope of this paper, and would require a specific study left for future research. nevertheless in this section we present a preliminary test restricted to the cm  <dig>  to show the potentialities of this approach. this choice is motivated by the fact that this cm is the only one described with a certain detail in the work of segal and colleagues  <cit>  with more than  <dig> genes, and thus is present in our experiments .

evaluation of the functional coherence of the cm  <dig> gene ranking
the performance obtained by the compared methods in the prediction of cm  <dig> genes are reported in table  <dig>  according to the ranking obtained with sknn, k =  <dig> , we found that the first gene annotated in cm  <dig>   ranked only tenth. the  <dig> top ranked "false positive" genes are: npr <dig>  col6a <dig>  dlx <dig>  col1a <dig>  nppb, bmp <dig>  col3a <dig>  dlx <dig> and col6a <dig>  ranked in this order. to evaluate the functional coherence of this set of genes, we applied a functional profiling test of this list of  <dig> genes using gprofiler  <cit> . results revealed that some of the genes in this list are associated with the go biological process  term go: <dig>  skeletal system development , consistently to one of the gene sets, skeletal development, initially involved in the definition of cm  <dig>  we also found a significant functional association with the go cellular component  terms go: <dig>  proteinaceous extracellular matrix  and go: <dig>  anchoring collagen . moreover, a closer look at the members of the gene sets involved in the construction of cm  <dig>  revealed that the bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  was present in the skeletal development gene set used in the construction of cm  <dig> but was not included in the final cm. these observations confirmed the functional coherence of these top-ranked genes, supporting the hypothesis that the proposed method is able to discover genes that are involved in the same biological processes represented by the considered expression signatures.

average precision at  <dig>  and  <dig>  recall and average auc for the cm  <dig> .

evaluation of the pathological coherence of the cm  <dig> gene ranking
cm  <dig> is composed of genes involved in the proliferation and differentiation of bone-building cells  <cit> . the genes included in this module were found to be induced in arrays obtained from breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma  and nontumor hepatitis-infected liver samples  <cit> . genes in this cm were also found to be repressed in subsets of hcc, in a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia , and in a subset of lung cancer samples.

details about the performance of the compared methods with respect to cm  <dig> are presented in table  <dig>  this table shows the average precision at  <dig>  and  <dig>  recall, and the average auc of the methods. in terms of precision at both  <dig>  and  <dig>  recall the kernelized score function achieve the best results, while in terms of average auc genemania obtains slightly better results than the other methods.

to test the pathological coherence of the list of the  <dig> top ranked "false positive" genes found by sknn , we mined the literature searching for evidences suggesting that those genes are involved in liver, breast, lung cancer or all. the equivalence of gene names or symbols was assessed using the information available for each gene in the human gene compendium  <cit> . col6a <dig> was recently found to be overexpressed in a study aimed at the investigation of extracellular matrix dynamics in hepatocarcinogenesis in two mouse models  <cit> , supporting the usefulness of data derived from more than one species in the investigated ranking tasks. the dlx gene family encodes for homeobox transcription factors involved in the control of morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis. a recent work  <cit>  reported evidences that dlx <dig> is activated during metastasis formation in a breast cancer cell line. an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of type i collagen a <dig>  was recently associated with susceptibility for hcc in a chinese population in  <cit> . in a recent work  <cit>  the authors described a molecular mechanism by which bmp <dig> suppresses breast cancer metastasis. another recent work  <cit>  reported that cpg islands in the homeobox dxl <dig> gene are significantly more methylated in a subtype  of breast tumors. a quantitative analysis focused on the study of the lung cancer cell secretome revealed that col6a <dig> is a metastasis-associated protein  <cit> .

the  <dig> top ranked "false positive" genes predicted by the zhou method are nppb, nppc, nppa, col6a <dig>  fn <dig>  col3a <dig>  npr <dig>  col1a <dig> and furin . the col6a <dig>  col3a <dig>  col1a <dig> and npr <dig> genes are also present in the top ranked prediction of our proposed method. the natriuretic peptide precursor b  has been recently investigated as potential biomarker in lung cancer  <cit> . the c-natriuretic peptide nppc can significantly decrease the number of small-cell lung cancer cells as demonstrated in  <cit> . it was not possible to found supporting literature for the association of nppa with the tumor types in which cm <dig> was found to be activated or deactivated by segal and colleagues. in  <cit>  fn <dig> was sought to be of prognostic value using a univariate analysis of gene expression. fn <dig> was also bound to be a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinomas in  <cit> . furin is involved in the modulation of the activity of the membrane type- <dig> matrix metalloproteinase , an enzyme for which a protumorigenic action has been recently observed  <cit>  in breast cancer cells.

the  <dig> top ranked "false positive" genes predicted by genemania are sftpc, nppb, chrdl <dig>  nppc, nppa, dlx <dig>  galnt <dig>  glrb and dlx <dig> . of these genes three  are also present in the list of top ranked false positives predicted by the zhou method while the dlx <dig> gene was also predicted as top ranked false positive by our proposed method. quite interestingly kernelized score functions predicted as top ranked false positives two members of the dlx genes family , while genemania predicted as false positive another member of the family . among the false positives predicted only by genemania, we observe that galnt <dig> is a target of the erbb <dig> oncogene in breast cancer  <cit> .

the  <dig> top ranked "false positive: genes predicted by the labelprop method are grb <dig>  actb, prkaca, sp <dig>  mapk <dig>  hsp90aa <dig>  hspa <dig>  mapk <dig> and src . in this case we found a less strict evidence of association with the tumor types related to cm  <dig>  moreover there is no overlap with "false positive" top ranked genes of the other methods. this is not surprising since this method behaves poorly with respect to both precision at fixed recall and auc .

summarizing, three of the considered methods  are able to detect novel genes associated to cancer types related to cm  <dig>  but not included yet in cm  <dig> itself. these results show that by exploiting functional interaction data not limited to gene expression data, our proposed kernelized score functions and other state-of-the-art gene ranking network-based methods could be in perspective applied to discover novel genes involved in different cancer types related to specific cms, thus mitigating a serious problem affecting expression signature based approaches: the difficulty in placing these signatures in a wider biological context.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we applied state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods to rank genes according to their likelihood to belong to specific cms, using gene networks constructed from several sources of functional interaction data, such as reactome and other curated pathways databases, physical protein-protein interactions, proteins domain-domain interactions, protein interactions obtained via biomedical text mining and gene ontology annotations, and functional interactions derived from yeast, fly and worm by means of a comparative genomics approach.

results show that using these integrated networks we can successfully predict cms defined mainly with expression signatures obtained from gene expression data profiling. in particular the integration of fi and humannet networks leads to the best results, independently of the method applied.

our proposed kernelized score functions compare favorably to state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods, both in terms of average auc and precision at a fixed recall, at least for recall levels lower than  <dig> , where a meaningful precision can be achieved in this difficult gene ranking task.

the substantial linearity of the proposed score functions  assures the scalability and applicability of the method to very large gene networks, as shown also by its empirical computational time, significantly lower with respect to the other compared methods.

moreover, the analysis of the ranking results obtained for the "bone osteoblastic module" , shows that our approach is able to detect genes involved in several types of cancer related to the same cancer module, but not necessarily included in the cancer module itself. these results show the potentiality of our proposed methods for the discovery of novel genes involved in the onset and progression of tumors related to cms, and a full genome study, extended to all cms, is left for future research.

another possible research line could be the study of learning strategies able to explicitly take into account the similarities between different cms. indeed learning a cm could be useful to better learn other related cms and some kind of knowledge transfer  <cit>  or also multi-task learning strategies could be explored in this context.
