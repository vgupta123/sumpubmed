BACKGROUND
the function of the ovary is to produce and release oocytes to be fertilised, leading to the production of offspring. oocytes develop within ovarian follicles which in most mammals are formed during fetal life. these primordial follicles consist of an oocyte arrested in meiosis, and therefore not capable of mitosis. the oocyte is surrounded by a single layer of inactive pregranulosa cells  <cit> . these primordial follicles comprise the ‘ovarian reserve’ from which a number of follicles are activated each day to commence growth and maturation. during this process of folliculogenesis, the oocyte enlarges substantially, pregranulosa cells differentiate into granulosa cells and replicate, and a large fluid-filled antrum develops in the middle of the follicle  <cit> . the growth of antral follicles is largely under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone   <cit> . during follicle growth granulosa cells produce increasingly more of the hormone oestradiol. after the surge release of luteinising hormone  from the anterior pituitary gland which results in ovulation of the oocyte, the remaining granulosa cells of the follicle wall transform into luteal cells of the corpus luteum and produce progesterone  <cit> . hence both the numbers and maturation of granulosa cells in any given follicle are important and both processes are regulated by gonadotrophic hormones from the anterior pituitary.

in mammals, the number of primordial follicles far exceeds the numbers that ovulate over a lifetime. for example in humans, millions of primordial follicles are formed in the fetal gonad but only about  <dig> will be ovulated  <cit> . since the numbers of follicles at menopause is practically nil  <cit> , the vast majority of follicles undergo atresia and regress. the incidence of follicular atresia  <cit>  is a normal process of ovarian function and its occurrence across species appears to have increased, with the evolution of viviparity in which a reduced number of female gametes are required when compared to mass-spawning species. atresia in any species can regulate the number of oocytes ovulated and contribute to the timing of ovulation in a reproductive cycle.

the process of atresia in follicles large enough to have developed an antral cavity is characterised initially by death of the mural granulosa cells with the presence of pyknotic nuclei followed by loss of these layers into the antrum  <cit> . the entire follicle wall then begins to breakdown at the basal lamina and inflammatory cells migrate from the surrounding stromal theca layers, phagocytosing remnants of the granulosa cells and eventually the oocyte. atresia leads eventually to death of all the granulosa cells within a follicle. the cell death processes can involve apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and cornification, and any of the major cell types of the follicle can be involved, depending upon the stage of follicular development when atresia occurs  <cit> . atresia also involves active cellular processes including macrophage infiltration, phagocytosis, migration of fibroblasts from the theca and the production of collagen. interestingly, these are some of the processes also observed in wound healing  <cit> .

we hypothesise that apart from cell death, other signalling and pathways will be associated with the process of atresia. therefore, to advance our knowledge of atresia we undertook transcriptome profiling of granulosa cells from small antral follicles before and during atresia. there have been several studies published, which investigate granulosa gene expression in developing bovine antral follicles by microarray  <cit> . evans et al  <cit>  studied granulosa from small follicles using self–generated arrays of approximately  <dig>  genes. other studies have focused on follicles at larger sizes, comparing follicles with differences in oestradiol production due to selectively accelerated development . here we examined individual morphologically-classified healthy  and atretic  follicles at the small antral stage of less than 5 mm in diameter, prior to size deviation due to dominant selection. the bovine affy arrays we used contain more than  <dig>  annotated genes, thereby expanding the power to reveal networks and pathways involved in follicle regression. the healthy follicles were further classified into two phenotypes based upon the shape of the basally-situated granulosa cells, as either columnar or rounded  <cit> . these follicle types also differ in the quality of their oocytes when cultured in vitro <cit> . the atretic follicles were of the type called antral atretic  <cit> . this is the classic type of atresia commonly observed across species in which the antrally-situated granulosa cells are the first to undergo cell death.

RESULTS
in this study we have identified major differences in gene expression pathways and networks that develop in granulosa cells of small antral follicles during the process of atresia. to achieve this, granulosa cells from small healthy  and atretic  follicles were selected for the microarray gene expression analysis. to ensure that the granulosa cells isolated were not contaminated with any thecal cells, no follicles with more than a 1% level of expression of cyp17a <dig> found in thecal samples were included. cyp17a <dig> is expressed exclusively in thecal cells  <cit> . we also validated that our microarray analyses could detect differentially-expressed genes here by immunohistochemistry and elsewhere  <cit>  by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . table  <dig> shows the selected genes and their signal intensities and fold differences between healthy and atretic follicles. cdh <dig>  the gene for the cell-cell adhesion molecule e-cadherin, and nid <dig>  the gene for nidogen  <dig>  were both increased in atretic follicles. by immunohistochemistry, the levels of both e-cadherin  and nidogen  <dig>  were elevated in the membrana granulosa of atretic follicles. collagen type i was also examined by immunohistochemistry on the basis that col1a <dig> was elevated in atretic follicles. however, no collagen type  <dig> was detected in the membrana granulosa of healthy or atretic follicles but it was identified in the thecal layers at higher levels in atretic follicles. collagen type i contains both α <dig> and α <dig> subunits and whilst col1a <dig> was elevated col1a <dig> was not. thus expression of collagen type i could not be validated, but both cdh <dig> and nid <dig> were.

statistical analysis of differentially-expressed genes
small healthy follicles were classified as either columnar  or rounded  on the basis of the shape of the basally-situated granulosa cells  <cit>  as described in the methods. pca for the first three components  and hierarchical clustering  for the total number of probe sets  of all arrays in this study were conducted. neither of these unsupervised analytical methods separated the small healthy follicle arrays into the rounded and columnar groups, and in fact no genes were shown to be more than 2-fold differentially expressed between the two subgroups with a benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  of p <  <dig>  by anova. therefore, the small healthy follicle arrays were treated as a single group for further analyses  and compared with the small atretic follicle group.

before statistical analysis, pca for all arrays revealed that the first principal component which accounted for 51% of the variation in the data, could separate the atretic and healthy follicle groups . hierarchical classification of the signal intensity plot for these arrays similarly also showed primary clustering of the arrays into these two groups . the numbers of genes enriched 2-, 3-, and - <dig> fold by anova in either healthy or atretic follicles are shown in table  <dig>  follicular atresia was characterized by considerable change in the transcriptional processes of the granulosa cells as expected with over 22% of the total genes on the array being affected at least  <dig> fold or more . four hundred and forty probesets were up regulated and  <dig> were down regulated more than  <dig> fold in atretic follicles relative to small healthy follicles. using thresholds of 3- and 4-fold differential-expression levels with p <  <dig>  and <  <dig>  respectively, then  <dig>  and  <dig> differentially-expressed probe sets were identified, respectively . the larger dataset  was tabulated with gene and fold change details added as table  <dig>  and table  <dig>  and in additional file 1: table s <dig>

variability of gene expression between follicles
the pca indicated that the healthy follicles were a more heterogeneous group than the atretic follicles and we examined this further. in other studies examination of the variably expressed genes has recently been used as a tool to identify differences in the pathways of different neurological diseases  <cit> , therefore we applied a similar approach to our data. the coefficients of variation  for the healthy and the atretic follicles of each probe set were calculated and the size-frequency distribution plot for healthy and atretic follicles is shown in figure  <dig>  the healthy follicles  show increasing gene variation with increasing fold difference for the subset of genes which are differentially regulated between healthy and atretic follicles, which is not seen in the atretic follicle group . we investigated this variation further and identified the most highly variable genes in small healthy follicles. a group of  <dig> of the most variable probe sets in small healthy follicles, which had a coefficient of variation value of >  <dig> %, was assembled and analysed by ingenuity pathway analysis  and gene ontology  enrichment analysis . cell cycle regulation is the most common function associated with the highly variable gene dataset. thirteen genes were associated with go terms for this function and cyclin genes such as ccnb <dig>  ccnb <dig> and cdk <dig> were represented in both analyses and in the top canonical pathways. the enrichment analysis produced a number of additional functionally-related gene groups associated with variable expression. these categories included; regulation of vascularity, extracellular matrix, energy metabolism, inflammation, cell migration and mapk activity. interestingly, there were  <dig> extracellular matrix genes found to be highly variable across our healthy follicle arrays, and several of them code for a number of collagen types . energy metabolism was identified as an important process with an association of  <dig> genes from this variable group, particularly glucose metabolism via isr <dig>  igfbp <dig>  pdk <dig> and aspscr <dig>  molecules known to promote angiogenesis in the ovary such as vegf and angiopoietin, and an inhibitor thrombospondin, were also associated with our variable dataset.

†† significance of association of genes with canonical pathways was determined by a right tailed fisher’s exact test and the benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  for multiple comparisons. the variability of expression was determined by a frequency distribution of the coefficients of variation for probe sets across the arrays in the small healthy follicle group. the cut-off chosen was a coefficient of variation of >  <dig> % .

the large variability of gene expression across healthy follicles is probably not unexpected since small growing follicles have a number of possible growth trajectories:  <dig>  continued growth to become a dominant follicle, with the likelihood of a) ovulation or b) atresia,  <dig>  continued growth as a subordinate follicle with atresia as the ultimate fate or  <dig>  atresia at an earlier stage. whether this variability reflects early commitment or predisposition of follicles to one of the three outcomes, or whether it reflects flexibility without a predetermined outcome is not clear at this stage. however, our identification of the pathways and genes involved is an important first step towards understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for the growth and atresia of follicles.

pathway, network and upstream regulator analyses of healthy versus atretic follicles
a set of  <dig> probe sets, which were more than 4-fold differentially regulated in signal intensity between atretic and healthy follicles with a fdr of p <  <dig> , were subjected to pathway analyses in ipa. of these,  <dig> were mapped to known identities in the ingenuity knowledge database and only  <dig> were eligible for network generation, due to the presence of replicate probe sets with specificity for the same gene on the chip. this group contained  <dig> probe sets which were up regulated in atretic with respect to healthy follicles and  <dig> which were down regulated. the most significantly affected functions associated with this dataset were found to be cell death, organ development, tissue development and embryonic development, which were all predicted to be negatively regulated in atretic follicles . upstream regulator analysis revealed that the transcription factor genes tp <dig>  foxo <dig> and cebpb are predicted to be activated, whereas those of rxra, hnf1a and myc are inhibited on the basis of known interactions with the genes in our dataset . the most significant canonical pathways represented in our analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  the top ranked canonical pathway , contains signalling molecules from our dataset which are common to various inflammatory/fibrotic pathways such as the transforming growth factor-β   and tumour necrosis factor-α  pathways. the two most significant networks  also reflect this pattern of tissue remodelling/fibrosis gene expression. these networks also contain molecules which are present in the canonical pathways of hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation and tgfβ signalling and are up regulated in our analysis and should therefore positively stimulate these networks. these include genes such as thbs <dig>  plat, bambi, tgfbr <dig>  bmp <dig>  smad <dig>  fgfr <dig>  pdgfra and timp <dig>

go enrichment analyses of this dataset determined associations by the categories of biological process, molecular function and cellular component with atresia in granulosa cells from small follicles . these analyses revealed that blood vessel development and cell adhesion processes were affected through genes such as ctgf and vegfa, and vnn <dig> and pik3ca, respectively. the affected products of genes were localised in terms of this analysis to the extracellular matrix and the genes lamc <dig>  col1a <dig>  col3a1and col18a <dig> were found in this group. other functionally related genes of interest such as igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> and igfbp <dig> indicate that insulin growth factor activity appeared to be modulated during the atretic process.

transcriptional processes of atresia
apoptosis
apoptosis is believed to be the major process of cell death occurring in the antral atretic follicle  <cit> . there was a significant association in our study between atretic follicles and molecules which are influenced by the p <dig> transcription factor. p <dig> is an activator of apoptotic pathways in response to cell stress and functions by regulating cell cycle, dna repair and metabolic genes  <cit> . contrary to expectations, many genes which were up regulated in atretic follicles in this study are actually anti-apoptotic or protective against apoptosis such as cflar <cit> , pik3ca <cit>  and vnn <dig> <cit> . none of the caspases or fas genes which are known to be involved with apoptotic pathways were found to be differentially expressed to the same extent as those genes mentioned above. previous studies in cattle and humans have focused on antral follicles of a larger size  <cit> , than those used in this experiment. it is possible that cell death mechanisms that operate in larger follicles are different from those at an earlier stage, where cells are under different hormonal control, lh in addition to fsh, and in the presence of focimatrix  <cit> . an alternative theory is that only those granulosa cells in the atretic follicle with elevated expression of anti-apoptotic genes are capable of surviving longer during the process of apoptosis. this theory would fit with the granulosa stem cell model as proposed previously  <cit> . this model proposes that different types of granulosa cells within the same follicle are derived from stem cells which grow and divide and eventually differentiate into antral, basal and cumulus granulosa cells in the antral follicle. hence, at any one time not all granulosa cells would be equal and some could be more susceptible to apoptosis than others, as stem cells in muscle  <cit> , neural  <cit>  and bone marrow  <cit>  are .

intercellular junctions
we found increased expression of the claudin tight junction genes cldn <dig>  cldn <dig> and cldn <dig> and the e-cadherin gene, cdh <dig>  in atretic follicles. the increase in e-cadherin expression was also verified by immunohistochemistry. tight junctions act as a critical barrier to the passage of substances between the vasculature and the interior lumen of glands  <cit>  and together with gap junctions help maintain the overall stability of the epithelial layer structure  <cit> . they are also important for establishing polarity within epithelial cells in general  <cit> . properly formed tight junctions have not been observed in the membrana granulosa, though they do exist between sertoli cells, the analogous cell type in the testis  <cit> . gap junctions are present in the granulosa of several species with predominant expression of connexins  <dig> and  <dig> . e-cadherin is another protein found at intercellular junctions which is important for cell recognition and adhesion  <cit> , and has been demonstrated in human ovarian follicles  <cit> . claudin  <dig> gene expression has previously been shown to be up regulated during apoptotic insult induced by tamoxifen in some breast tumour cells  <cit> . again it is possible that those granulosa cells which have increased expression of these intercellular junction proteins may be able to modulate the effects of apoptotic mechanisms on the cell by stabilising the overall membrana granulosa structure.

inflammation/tgfβ signalling/tissue remodelling
there have been a number of studies examining tgfβ signalling molecules in follicle development, though not from the aspect of atresia. this is perhaps surprising given that follicular atresia necessitates a cyclic process of tissue remodelling, and the well-known involvement of the tgfβ superfamily in tissue repair. in both ipa and go enrichment analyses, there were a number of genes found to be associated with inflammatory/tgfβ signalling fibrosis pathways or processes. when we examined the hepatic fibrosis signalling pathway in ipa, with respect to the molecules affected from our dataset, there was increased expression of tgfbr <dig> and the downstream smad genes and subsequently col1a <dig> and col3a <dig>  the tgfβ receptor has been localised immunohistochemically to the granulosa cells of antral follicles of certain species  <cit> , though only in large antral follicles which maybe differentiating as they luteinise. a focus on those genes in our study which are differentially expressed in small follicles, and are expressed at a high level in either the healthy or atretic state, reveals that the inhibin-activin-follistatin axis was most important. inha and inhba, which encode activins and inhibin, and fst which produces follistatin, were all down regulated in atretic follicles in our study, which is in agreement with previously published work, as all are required for proper development of the follicle through the antral stage of development  <cit> . bambi expression in our atretic follicles was increased relative to healthy follicles; the encoded protein is known to bind and inhibit activin and bmp <dig>   <cit>  thus antagonising fsh-induced follicle growth.

anti-mullerian hormone  expression was also lower in the atretic follicle. amh has been shown to delay recruitment of primary follicles to the next stage of growth or possibly atresia  <cit> . additionally, amh has been shown to be up regulated in large dominant bovine follicles versus subdominant and it probably has a survival effect  <cit> . gdf- <dig> and bmp- <dig> are growth factors which have been studied in specific knockouts in mice or mutations in sheep and are known to be important for antral follicle growth . bmp <dig> was up regulated  <dig> fold in small healthy follicles in our study, whereas gdf <dig> was relatively unaffected, the proteins encoded by these genes are secreted specifically by the oocyte  <cit>  which makes up a small proportion of the total rna in our samples, so clearly bmp <dig> expression was activated but the status of gdf <dig> was not apparent. bmpr <dig>  encodes a receptor for gdf- <dig> and bmp- <dig> and is therefore also critical for follicle expansion. there was a slight increase in bmpr <dig> in the atretic follicle expression in our study, however, this was not significant. expression of bmp <dig> was elevated more than  <dig> fold in atretic follicles and this member of the bmp family has been implicated in activation of fsh-induced follicle growth and in suppression of luteinisation in human cultured granulosa cells  <cit> . however, this result was demonstrated in cells obtained from preovulatory follicles and it is unclear whether bmp- <dig> plays the same role earlier in follicle development.

angiogenesis
vegfa was down regulated in the atretic follicles and mdk  and thbs <dig> were up regulated in our study. vegf is a key pro-angiogenic factor and its expression is known to correlate with the size of healthy antral follicles  <cit>  and is weakly expressed in atretic follicles  <cit> . thrombospondins- <dig> and - <dig> are anti-angiogenic and are expressed highly during tissue remodelling following injury. thrombospondin- <dig> in particular appears during the late proliferative phase and is expressed during the remodelling period in conjunction with mmp- <dig>  <cit> . thrombospondin- <dig> has been shown to promote follicular atresia in rats  <cit> , and together with thrombospondin- <dig> is expressed inversely with vegf in a cyclical fashion during folliculogenesis in cows  <cit> . mdk is expressed in many tissues throughout embryonic development, and it has been shown to antagonise vegf signalling in vitro and in vivo <cit> . atresia in small antral follicles predictably appears to involve a decrease in blood vessel formation which agrees with previous data.

insulin metabolism
we found increased levels of expression of igf2r, and the binding protein genes igfbp <dig> and igfbp <dig> in atretic follicles with respect to healthy follicles. a number of studies have determined the importance of insulin-like growth factor metabolism at antral stages of follicle development  <cit> . igf- <dig> acts similarly to igf- <dig> to promote proliferation and growth of granulosa cells, but it is specifically bound by igf- <dig> receptor which does not signal by the same pathways as the igf- <dig> receptor, but rather acts as a clearance mechanism for igf- <dig>  <cit> . the igf binding proteins bind igf- <dig> and - <dig>  and thus locally regulate their bioavailability in the follicle  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> has previously been shown to increase in atretic follicles in ruminants  <cit>  perhaps due to increased expression and changing levels of degradative enzymes. therefore it seems that antral atretic follicles have reduced igf signalling contributing to lower proliferation and decreased metabolism by granulosa cells as has been previously published.

extracellular matrix and matrix proteases
there are several matrix genes which were differentially regulated in our arrays in the atretic follicles including col1a <dig>  col3a <dig>  col4a <dig>  nid <dig>  lamb <dig> and lamc <dig>  immunostaining confirmed that nidogen- <dig> protein was increased in atretic follicles. collagens type i and iv were not detectable in the granulosa cells of small follicles at the small antral stage. previous immunohistochemical studies  <cit>  found that the composition of the extracellular matrix did not change, apart from the presence of laminin α <dig> in atretic but not healthy follicles, and that laminin β <dig> expression was very weak or nearly absent in small antral atretic follicles  <cit> . unfortunately, the laminin α <dig> gene probe set was not present on the array so this could not be confirmed by the present analysis. it is well known that collagens  <dig> and  <dig> are synthesised during the tissue remodelling phase following inflammation  <cit> . lee and dunbar showed an increasing accumulation of laminin β1/γ <dig> in between granulosa and theca cells in progressively atretic follicles in the pig  <cit> , although a similar study by ourselves in bovine follicles did not indicate differences in laminin β <dig> in the follicular basement membrane and membrana granulosa  <cit> . recently, laminin γ <dig> was found to be secreted by cultured epithelial cells in response to wounding and may act as a scaffold for cell migration  <cit> . the expression of these genes in our current study probably represents a step in the eventual regression of the atretic follicle.

annexin a <dig> has been shown to be actively involved in endocytosis and formation of adherens junctions  <cit> . there is phagocytosis of necrotic cellular debris during atresia and we observed an up regulation of e-cadherin expression in the atretic follicular granulosa cells.

CONCLUSIONS
small healthy antral follicles, which can undergo a number of growth options, exhibit greater variability in gene expression, particularly in genes associated with cell division and other growth-related functions. it is clear that atresia is associated with transcriptional processes such as the inhibition of blood vessel formation and the differential expression of matrix genes which may signal the surrounding stromal cells to initiate follicular remodelling. therefore, atresia not only involves changes in expression of genes associated with cell death but it is clearly also an active process not dissimilar to that of wound healing.
