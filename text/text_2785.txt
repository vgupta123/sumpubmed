BACKGROUND
insertion sequences  are small , generally phenotypically cryptic segments of dna able to jump, or copy themselves, into various genomic sites with no need for dna homology  <cit> . they generally encode no functions other than those involved in their mobility, although elements including additional genes are now being identified  <cit> . while almost exclusively restricted to bacterial and archaeal genomes, they are, like eukaryotic transposable elements, involved in a wide variety of biological transactions leading to genome reshuffling and evolution. indeed, their ability to proliferate within a genome provides the potential for homologous recombination-mediated deletions or inversions, and their capacity to transport accessory genes represents an additional contribution to genome flexibility. by affecting gene expression and facilitating the emergence of new gene clusters they play an important role in adaptability of their host. eventually, horizontal transfer mechanisms such as conjugation allow these is-mediated sets of genes to cross barriers between strains, species and beyond  <cit> .

the dna breaks and joins necessary for transposition are catalysed by an element encoded protein referred to as transposase. these proteins determine transposition mechanisms and are now used to lead classification of prokaryotic transposable elements in general. accordingly, transposases that form a covalent intermediate with dna are distinguished from those that do not. additional distinction is provided by protein active-site residues crucial for transposition. these define the five major transposase classes currently established : tyrosine , serine , relaxase  and rolling-circle  transposases involve covalent intermediates with dna during transposition, while the fifth class, namely dde transposases, prompts transposition via direct transesterification reactions  <cit> .

dde transposases display three acidic residues in three distinct regions of their primary sequence, namely regions n <dig>  n <dig> and c <dig>  which harbor the aspartate , aspartate  and glutamate  residues, respectively. spacers of various lengths separate these regions, but their acidic residues are brought together upon protein folding to form a catalytic triad essential for transposition  <cit> .

prokaryotic dde transposons  can move in two different ways, depending on the fate of the donor site. replicative transposons mobilize a copy of their dna, leaving the parent site intact, while conservative transposons cut themselves out of the donor molecule in order to paste their dna into the target  <cit> .

beyond mechanistic behaviors, each individual is is characterized by structural features used to fine-tune their classification. a wealth of these data is currently generated with the rising availability of whole genome sequencing projects. as of july  <dig>  more than  <dig> different is families are established based on over  <dig> bacterial and archaeal is sequences  <cit> . an is family can be defined as a collection of elements sharing the same catalytic site structure , an identical genetic organization , similar arrangements of their ends and uniform target site fates upon insertion. however, not all families are so coherent. this is why some of them  are divided into subgroups being composed of a core of closely related elements that can be linked to other members of the family by weaker but still significant similarities.

the is <dig> family, like most is families described so far, contains elements mobilized by dde transposases performing a 'cut-and-paste' mechanism. the main and almost only hallmarks of this family's transposases are  absence of frameshift in the transposase gene and  an y--r--e-- signature  in region c <dig> where the glutamate residue is that of the dde motif  <cit> . only very few is <dig> elements have been studied in detail. is231a has been shown to transpose in vivo by a 'cut-and-paste' mechanism  <cit> , both in its natural host, bacillus thuringiensis  <cit> , and in escherichia coli  <cit> ; and it displays a certain degree of insertion specificity  <cit> . both is10r and is50r are part of composite transposons  and are the only members for which in vitro systems have been set up. the latter has allowed extensive acquisition of genetic, biochemical, mechanistic and regulation data for these elements. also, the tn <dig> transposase is the only is <dig> element for which x-ray crystallographic structure data are available  <cit> .

since the initial definition of family is <dig> , other elements were progressively added via isfinder, the prokaryotic is database  <cit> . however, some of them displayed distant resemblance both to existing is <dig> members as well as members of other groups such as the is <dig> family or isncy . some elements even lacked the above mentioned distinguishing protein motifs. it was therefore necessary to perform a systematic screen for related elements in order to gain a more rational view of the organization of the is <dig> family.

here we report an extensive in silico search for is elements related to family is <dig> among more than  <dig> complete bacterial and archaeal genomes. a total of  <dig> putative intact is4-related elements were collected and permitted a detailed update of the is <dig> catalogue, together with the description of novel emerging is families. this allowed the evaluation of their distribution and impact among major prokaryotic phyla. finally, known transposition mechanisms could be discussed in light of novel primary sequence data.

RESULTS
classification process
the present assignment of families and subgroups is primarily based on transposase and dna end sequence data. analysis of transposases was performed by multiple sequence alignments and clustering methods followed by dendrogram construction to set up clusters of related proteins . left and right dna extremities flanking transposase genes were aligned  to each other to facilitate observation of terminal inverted repeats  and  with tirs from other iss to detect dna extremity conservations. together, these approaches split the initial is set into ten groups. in each of them, the percentage of residue identity among transposase pairs often varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> %, highlighting the magnitude of divergence occurring among elements of a same is group. the length of tirs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and many of them were imperfect. comparison of tirs from different elements of a given is group uncovered unique and conserved signatures in each of them, illustrating the relationship between the transposase sequence and the is terminal repeats .

to validate this clustering, established groups were analysed independently for conservation of specific transposase domains as well as length and specificity of target site duplications. analysis of transposase dde catalytic regions  revealed a perfect conservation of the dde motif , while the size and sequence of the spacers that separate these catalytic residues differed among the ten groups. the yrek motif was partially lacking in three groups, where either its tyrosine, arginine or lysine residue was not conserved. according to the definition of is families, is groups sharing the same catalytic site structure were assigned together. seven clusters displayed the complete yrek motif; and were named subgroups is <dig>  ish <dig>  is4sa, is <dig>  ispepr <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig>  the three remaining groups all displayed a distinct variation of the yrek motif and were therefore assigned to different and new families, namely is <dig>  ish <dig> and is <dig>  referred as emerging families. finally, while is <dig> family members generated about  <dig> bp target duplications, i.e. the approximate length of a complete dna helix turn, those from emerging families displayed direct repeats  of around five bps, which corresponds approximately to half a dna helix turn .

review of family is4
family is <dig> included  <dig> distinct intact elements. the main hallmarks were the presence of dde and yrek motifs, single orf encoded transposases and target site duplication lengths corresponding approximately to one dna helix turn. considerable diversity was observed at the level of transposase regions  outside catalytic residues, dna end signatures and target site specificity. the following description of established subgroups will summarize this diversity.

subgroup is <dig> was previously established  and was the most coherent one since many transposase pairs displayed sequence identity percentages above  <dig> . likewise, their dna ends are among the most conserved. a clear relationship was observed between transposase and extremity conservation . this is particularly true for left extremities  where transposase-related conservation extended beyond the tirs. the is <dig> subgroup further distinguished itself by the fact that its members occurred almost exclusively in genomes of phylogenetically close bacteria composing the b. cereus sensu lato group . as previously shown, an important hallmark is the large size range of its elements . a significant fraction of them displayed additional dna between the left tir and the transposase gene  <cit> , which is still unusual among iss. in this study, novel putative passenger genes were found in these extra sequences coding for resistance, virulence or metabolism determinants as well as unknown orfs . this modular aspect has not yet been observed in other is families or is <dig> subgroups, which may be due to the fact that, so far, no systematic and thorough searches for supplementary is dna were carried out in other families.

the new organization of family is <dig> is shown together with emerging families. the table summarizes dna characteristics with transposase motifs and target site duplication lengths. the two major differences between is <dig> and emerging families are presence or absence of the yrek motif and dissimilar lengths of drs.

subgroup ish <dig> was initially included into subgroup is4sa  <cit> . yet, our results showed a closer proximity to subgroup is231; not only at the transposase level, but also due to dna extremity conservations . ish <dig> elements were initially discovered in archaea but recent genome projects uncovered elements of this subgroup in proteobacteria. examination of ish <dig> insertions did not reveal apparent target site specificity, contrary to the one observed for is <dig> elements .

subgroups is4sa and is4
this study provided the first thorough description of subgroup is4sa that was originally mentioned in reference  <cit> . together with is4sa-like elements appeared a closely related subgroup including element is <dig>  which provided the name for this second ensemble. subgroups is4sa and is <dig> were relatively close at the protein level and the major argument for splitting them in two was a different organization of tirs . extremities in subgroups is4sa and is <dig> displayed relaxed conservation of the third and first nucleotide, respectively, which is rather new but not unique in family is <dig> . some elements of subgroup is <dig> displayed spectacular apparent insertion specificity in left and right target arms, a conservation that was also observed for isrm <dig> from subgroup is4sa . both subgroups were quite diverse and broadly distributed in bacteria. rare occurrences were recorded in archaea  and algae viruses .

subgroups is <dig> and is <dig> were the only ones that did not cluster together with subgroups is <dig>  ish <dig>  is4sa, is <dig> and ispepr <dig> during tribe-mcl analysis , indicating more distant relationships with these subgroups. this was also observed at the level of dna ends since they systematically displayed 5'-nt extremities instead of 5'-na. yet, they displayed key residue conservation  and target site duplication lengths comparable to typical is <dig> elements . so far, the majority of both subgroups occurred among proteobacteria.

subgroup ispepr <dig> was also newly established here and is almost exclusively composed of novel elements. although it is composed of a limited repertoire, it is already forming a consistent subgroup with apparent insertion preference for at-rich sequences  and, like elements of subgroups is <dig> and is <dig>  it preferentially displays 5'-ct ends , in contrast to 5'-ca extremities encountered in the other elements from family is <dig> 

emerging families
members of family is <dig> were already considered distantly related to is <dig> in reference  <cit>  and this was confirmed here. only four of the  <dig> considered is <dig> elements displayed the tyrosine of the yrek motif ; and almost all elements displayed a highly conserved target site duplication of exactly four bps . the diversity emanating from is <dig> transposases and tirs allowed identification of three distinct clusters , which announced a possible division into subgroups. as indicated by their prokaryotic distribution, family is <dig> seemed to be rather widespread .

family ish <dig> was a small group so far restricted to archaea . half of their transposases lacked the lysine residue of the yrek motif while all  displayed a y--r--e-- motif. drs flanking ish3-like insertions are typically five bps long and generally flanked by a at one end and t at the other end.

family is <dig> was initially named is <dig>  <cit> . this new designation should prevent confusion with an emerging group called is <dig>  <cit> . transposases were among the largest due to relatively long n3-c <dig> spacers, which were sometimes twice as long as those from family is <dig>  only five out of  <dig> displayed the arginine residue of the yrek motif . this large group could be divided in  distinct clusters according to transposases . target site duplications were five to six bp at-rich tracts while dna ends were only poorly conserved. they were remarkably diverse in archaea and relatively widespread in bacteria .

distribution of copy numbers
members of the is <dig> family were found in  <dig> out of  <dig>  complete genomes representing  <dig> prokaryotic species. families is <dig>  ish <dig> and is <dig> displayed lower incidences, being present in ~ <dig> %, ~ <dig>  % and ~ <dig> % of available genomes, respectively.  <dig> of these genomes included plasmids of which  <dig> harbored elements of these families. figure  <dig> displays the distribution of is genomic copy numbers as it was found on chromosomes and plasmids. the distribution of family is <dig> uncovered a clear preference for single genomic copies, followed by a preference for two, three and six to eight copies per genome. the genomes of photobacterium profundum ss <dig>  mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides sc strain pg <dig>  sulfolobus solfataricus p <dig> and the two sequenced strains of xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae displayed the highest amounts of elements from families is <dig>  is <dig>  ish <dig> and is <dig>  respectively . the most is-rich extrachromosomal replicons were megaplasmids pnrc <dig>  and pnrc <dig>  from halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  which harbored together  <dig> copies of is <dig> family elements and  <dig> copies of family ish <dig> elements.

distribution of is subgroups and families among prokaryotic phyla and viruses
the distribution of individual elements among the different bacterial and archaeal phyla is shown in figure  <dig>  as indicated by the histogram in figure 4b, current sequencing projects focus unequally on different prokaryotic phyla  <cit> . the distribution presented in figure 4a partially reflected this sequencing bias, which is why most gathered elements were found in proteobacteria. globally, families is <dig>  is <dig>  ish <dig> and is <dig> were detected in eight, seven, two and seven phyla, respectively.

discussion
impact of is <dig> and related families on prokaryotic genomes
the availability of a large number of completely sequenced genomes on one hand, and the extensive manual characterization of an is family on the other hand, allowed a direct evaluation of global presence of its putatively functional members. family is <dig> displayed a sporadic distribution among  <dig> % of explored genomes. moreover, the behavior of these iss was assessed by determining their genomic occurrence. this showed that numerous elements exhibited single or low copy numbers, which was in line with the assumption that transposable elements need to compromise between transposition for self maintenance and limited insertions to keep host genome integrity  <cit> . this distribution also displayed a certain, less pronounced, prevalence for copy numbers between  <dig> and  <dig>  although the biological relevance of this observation remains unclear.

while the global distribution of is elements was shown to be rather sporadic, important expansion events were observed in a few pathogens as well as in some free-living extremophiles. one of these pathogens is a member of the facultative intracellular mycoplasma, of which eleven genomes are available.  <dig> intact copies of family is <dig> elements were found together with  <dig> intact copies of the is <dig> family in m. mycoides  <cit> . the presence of family is <dig> was also detected in m. synoviae  <cit> , m. agalactiae  and the three strains of m. hyopneumoniae  <cit> . only m. genitalium  <cit> , m. pneumoniae  <cit>  and m. mobile  <cit>  were devoid of iss. interestingly, the mycoplasma species lacking iss were also those displaying the smallest genomes , while the is-rich m. mycoides had a relatively large genome . a positive correlation between the total number of genes and the amount of mobile dna in a genome has been reported for other facultative intracellular bacteria  <cit> , and a recent study has extended this observation to other prokaryotes  <cit> . however, this relationship must be seen as a trend with notable exceptions .

family is <dig> was represented by  <dig> and  <dig> elements in the genomes of two sequenced pathovars of the rice pathogen x. oryzae  <cit> . this family was completely absent in phylogenetically related species with available genome sequences, including x. campestris  and x. axonopodis   <cit> . additionally, a moderate presence of family is <dig> was observed in all but one of the six xanthomonas genomes , together with other, more expanded families. so far, all sequenced xanthomonads are is-rich, which is supposed to provide the necessary flexibility for adaptation to different plant hosts  <cit> . interestingly, each strain is characterized by the expansion of one specific is family  <cit> . the is <dig> family was also observed to be relatively expanded in sequenced shigella spp. where other families, both with higher and lower expansion levels, were also detected  <cit> . these mobile elements are supposed to contribute to the emergence of variable epidemiological and pathological features among these phylogenetically close pathogens  <cit> .

these observations are reminiscent of is expansions observed together with emergence of pathogenicity in other host associated pathogens, such as bordetella pertussis , yersinia pestis  and francisella tularensis .

a different relationship was observed in the genus vibrio. the expansion of family is <dig> in the non-pathogenic photobacterium  <cit>  was striking  as compared to those observed in the pathogenic vibrionaceae, such as v. cholerae  <cit> , v. parahaemolyticus  <cit>  and v. vulnificus  <cit> , that displayed relatively modest is contents. therefore, iss apparently have a quite different role in vibrio evolution, where some is-rich species are non-pathogenic piezophiles. other important is expansions among free-living extremophiles were observed in one out of three sulfolobus spp.  <cit> , where family ish <dig> represents a significant fraction of global is content, as well as in halobacterium, which harbors numerous copies of is <dig> and ish <dig> elements together with other families  <cit> .

lateral transfer and clade specificity
analysis of the distribution of individual elements among prokaryotes and among established families and subgroups was also performed regardless of copy numbers . prokaryotic is hosts were from world-wide origins and covered a large range of lifestyles and habitats, from free-living environmental germs and extremophiles to host associated symbionts and pathogens. evaluation of emergence on evolutionary timescales, as well as estimation of horizontal gene transfer  extent prompted by this distribution remain both problematic because of low identity levels among transposases. however, many is4-related elements were found on putative mobile dna, including various plasmids , bacteriophages  and one eukaryotic virus . additionally, most is4-related subgroups and emerging families were scattered over several phyla , suggesting an involvement of hgt in the dissemination of these elements.

reports on prokaryotic is distribution have shown that is families are not clade-specific and our data regarding family is <dig> were in agreement with this assumption. however, the distribution of is <dig> subgroups and emerging families showed that the number of elements of some is groups was not systematically proportional to the extent of genome sequencing . subgroup is <dig>  was almost exclusively restricted to firmicutes and  <dig> of its  <dig> elements were found among bacteria of the b. cereus s.l. group. likewise, family is <dig>  and to a lesser extent family ish <dig> and subgroup ish <dig>  were preferentially found among euryarchaeota. these observations may partially be due to insufficient genome data, but they do not rule out the possibility of existing clade specificity at the level of is subgroups. preferential is occurrences among certain prokaryotic phyla or genera can be the consequence of isolated niches reducing or limiting horizontal transfer of hosted iss. in this case, a series of extremophilic archaea were almost exclusive hosts of subgroup ish <dig> and family ish <dig>  their preference for harsh ecological niches may represent a frontier for hgt with other phyla or with bacteria. another possible explanation can be based on is-associated features. it is possible that the presence of some iss cannot be tolerated by certain hosts. uncontrollable transposition behaviors, lack of target site specificity, preferred insertions into vital genes or regulatory regions can limit the host compatibility of some iss for which a viable equilibrium can be found only in rare 'is – host' combinations.

reaction mechanisms
the co-crystal structure of the is50r transposase binding the ends of the tn <dig> transposon generated function assignments for numerous residues of this protein  <cit> . a comparative sequence analysis based on  <dig> transposases was performed and compared with a previous report on seven transposases from subgroup is <dig> by reznikoff et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . this confirmed the previous function assignment of conserved residues since most identified domains were still conserved among this subgroup, as were a series of residues with unknown function .

the primary sequence data concerning the transposase motifs  and target site duplications  suggested divergent biochemical behaviors between is <dig> transposases and those from the emerging families. the two 3'-oh transposon ends are known to attack the target helix at opposite sites in the case of is <dig>  for the emerging families, the length of target site duplications  suggested a different target strand cleavage path: owing to the structure of b-dna, this attack needs to come from the same helix side. it is worth noting that in the case of family is <dig>  two elements were reported to display atypical target site duplication lengths. is <dig> and is <dig>  from m. smegmatis and m. mycoides, respectively, have both been shown to produce long, variable-length drs upon insertion  <cit> . they had lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bps, depending on the copy. so far, no mechanistic model has been proposed for the generation of this variable target duplication size.

CONCLUSIONS
this study consisted in a thorough and systematic screen for is4-related elements among available genome sequence data. it allowed a considerable improvement regarding the description and definition of family is <dig>  as well as the establishment of new is families which were, until now, assimilated to the is <dig> ensemble . thus,  <dig> distinct is families are now officially established. novel primary sequence descriptions were unraveled for reported families, which will allow easier identification of other related elements as they will be uncovered with ongoing genome sequencing projects. this work also established a link between genomic and functional data regarding reaction mechanisms, which underlined the importance of both approaches for a more complete understanding of transposition biology.

the extent of genomic impact of single is families showed that is <dig> and its related families are far from being ubiquitous among prokaryotes. this limited is distribution applies to most known is families as reported by a recent automated survey of bacterial iss  <cit> . significant genome wide expansions were observed only in a few host-associated pathogens and certain free-living extremophiles, suggesting that particular iss could have been, at least partially, implicated in the emergence or evolution of these particular lifestyles. yet, the reasons explaining these sporadic is demographic explosions remain to be uncovered.

our interpretation of these results is that the is families described here, and probably iss in general, represent an evolutionary tool available among several. in order to provide the necessary genome flexibility for adaptation to new or variable environments, evolution seems to select this tool in some cases. in contrast to a purely 'selfish' or 'parasitic' perception of mobile dna, this view supports the idea that prokaryotes, and maybe life in general, may also make use of mobile dna for its own benefits, rather than being constantly invaded by it in an uncontrollable manner.
