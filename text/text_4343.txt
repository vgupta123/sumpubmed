BACKGROUND
retinal ganglion cells  are a group of specialized sensory neurons in the central nervous system, rested in the inner layer of the retina. rgcs capture visual signals from bipolar and amacrine cells through the photoreceptors on the outer retina, and electrically transmit that information to the brain. in glaucoma patients, increased intraocular pressure damage the cell bodies as well as the axons of rgcs, resulting in permanent and irreversible blindness  <cit> . the degeneration of retina in glaucoma patients is often accompanied by apoptosis of rgcs, which may be caused by excitotoxicity, hypoxia, or oxidative stress  <cit> . many of the molecular pathways, including akt, erk, insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  and its receptor igf1r, brain-derived neurotrophic factor  and its tyrosine kinase receptor trkb, repulsive guidance molecule, rgma and its receptor neogenin, are actively involved in the development or the protection/regeneration of sensory neurons including rgc  <cit> . however, though many of the molecular pathways have been identified to protect rgcs from degeneration and induce optical nerve regeneration  <cit> , the exact mechanism of rgc damage, or feasible clinical strategy for rgc regeneration are largely unknown.

micrornas  are a group of noncoding rnas with ~ <dig> nucleotides, that inhibit endogenous gene expression through translational cleavage  <cit> . in both animal and human visual systems, mirnas have been demonstrated to be involved in various aspects of retina development, including retinogenesis, retinal homeostasis, or retinal damage. for example, studies in mutant mice have shown that, mir-183/96/ <dig> clusters and mir132/ <dig> were essential for the synaptic development in retina  <cit> , and mir- <dig> was critical for the maturation of cone cells  <cit>  in retina. study also showed that mir- <dig> inhibits robo/slit pathway to maintain normal vascular function in retina  <cit> . in retinal ganglion cells, a recent study specifically demonstrated that mir- <dig> was involved in bdnf-mediated retinal ganglion axonal branching and maturation  <cit> . specifically, emerging evidences demonstrate that mirnas are highly associated with many aspects of retinal degeneration  <cit> , yet the exact mechanisms of mirnas on regulating retinal apoptosis or degeneration are largely unknown. microrna- <dig> , a member of mir- <dig> family , is a key apoptotic regulator in various cell types  <cit> . in retina, mir- <dig> was found to be associated with diabetic retinopathy, a common retinal disease leading to total blindness  <cit> . however, the function role of mir- <dig> in mediating retinal development or pathology remains elusive.

in the present study, we used an in vitro culture system to induce oxidative stress by h2o <dig> application in rat ganglion cell line rgc- <dig> cells. we found that microrna  <dig>  was specifically upregulated in rgc- <dig> cells upon apoptosis. we then investigated the anti-apoptosis effect of down-regulating mir- <dig>  as well as the association between mir- <dig> down-regulation and apoptosis-related pathways, akt/erk/trkb and igf1r, in retina ganglion cells.

RESULTS
h2o <dig> induced apoptosis and upregulated mir- <dig> in rgc- <dig> cells in a dose-dependent manner
first, we investigated the effect of oxidative stress on rgc- <dig> cell apoptosis. in our study, we cultured rgc- <dig> cells in 6-well plate for 24 hours, then included different concentration of h2o <dig>  in rgc- <dig> cell culture for another 24 hours, followed by immunocytochemistry. the apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay. rgc- <dig> cells were identified by an antibody against brn3a, a rgc- <dig> specific marker. our results showed that h2o <dig> at the concentrations of  <dig> and 1000 μm induced significant apoptosis among rgc- <dig> cells . further analysis by quantifying the percentage of tunel-positive cells among all brn3a-positive rgc- <dig> cells revealed that the apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells was induced by h2o <dig> in a dose dependent manner . we then looked at the effect of h2o2-induced apoptosis on the expression level of mir- <dig> in rgc- <dig> cells. our results demonstrated that mir- <dig> was significantly up-regulated, and also in a dose-dependent manner by the application of h2o <dig> in rgc- <dig> cells .figure  <dig>

downregulation of mir- <dig> reduces h2o <dig> induced apoptosis and promoted neurite growth in rgc- <dig> cells
we then investigated whether mir- <dig> played a functional role in modulating h2o2-induced apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells. for that purpose, we constructed lentiviral vector expressing the inhibitory oligonucleotides of mir- <dig>  to specifically knock down the endogenous expression of mir- <dig>  the efficiency of down-regulating mir- <dig> by lentivirus was verified by qrt-pcr. in that experiment, rgc- <dig> cells were transfected with either mir100-inhibitor, or its non-specific mirna  for 24 hours. the results of qrt-pcr showed that the endogenous expression level of mir- <dig> was significantly and specifically down-regulated by mir100-inhibitor .figure  <dig> 
downregulation of mir- <dig> protected apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells. rgc- <dig> cells were pre-treated with lentiviral vector of mir100-inhibitor, or its non-specific mirna vector  for 24 hours, followed by h2o <dig>  treatment for another 24 hours.  the efficiency of down-regulating mir- <dig> by lentiviral vectors was evaluated by qrt-pcr . the effect of pre-treating rgc- <dig> cells with mir- <dig> down-regulation on oxidative stress induced apoptosis was then examined by tunel assay.  tunel staining was performed and representative fluorescent images were shown for the rgc- <dig> cells pre-treated with mir-nc, or mir100-inhibitor, and then h2o <dig>  <dig> .  the percentages of apoptotic rgc- <dig> cells were also quantified .



to evaluate the effect of down-regulating mir- <dig> on rgc- <dig> apoptosis, we pre-treated rgc- <dig> cells with either mir100-inhibitor or mir-nc for 24 hours, followed by h2o <dig>  treatment for another 24 hours. our results of tunel staining showed that significantly less apoptosis were observed in mir- <dig> down-regulated rgc- <dig> cells than in control rgc- <dig> cells . quantification results demonstrated that the percentage of apoptotic cells reduced from  <dig> % in control rgc- <dig> cells to around 30% in cells with mir- <dig> down-regulation .

interestingly, once the culture period was extended to 14 days after lentiviral transfection, we discovered that the morphology of rgc- <dig> cells was dramatically modified by mir- <dig> down-regulation. the rgc- <dig> cells with down-regulated mir- <dig> extended the peripherals to be long and neurite-like processes, whereas the cells without mir- <dig> downregulation kept original morphology of progenitor cell with short peripheral processes . quantitative measurement with imagj software  confirmed the effect of down-regulating mir- <dig> on promoting neurite length in rgc- <dig> cells .figure  <dig> 
downregulation of mir- <dig> promoted neurite growth in rgc- <dig> cells.  rgc- <dig> cells were treated with mir-nc or mir100-inhibitor for 14 days, followed by immunostaining with an antibody against thy- <dig> . dapi  staining was also performed.  neurite lengths were measured using imagej software and compared between mir100-inhibitor treated rgc- <dig> cells and mir-nc treated rgc- <dig> cells .



downregulation of mir- <dig> phosphorylated akt/erk/trkb pathways in rgc- <dig> cells
we then investigated the intracellular signaling pathways that might be involved in the protection of mir- <dig> down-regulation on rgc- <dig> apoptosis. in order to do that, rgc- <dig> cells were pre-treated with either mir100-inhibitor or mir-nc for 24 hours, followed by h2o <dig>  treatment for another 24 hours. western blotting analysis was used to measure the protein expression levels of thy- <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  akt and trkb, as well as phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  akt and trkb . our results demonstrated that down-regulating mir- <dig> did not alter the expression of thy- <dig>  however, mir- <dig> downregulation in rgc- <dig> cells significantly increased the phosphorylation in erk1/ <dig>  akt and trkb, while keeping the total protein levels of erk1/ <dig>  akt and trkb unchanged .figure  <dig>

igf1r was involved in mir- <dig> regulation in rgc-5
finally, we intended to explore the possible molecular target of mir- <dig> modulation in rgc- <dig> cells. through online bioinformatic screening , we noticed that, insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor  was a likely target of rat mir- <dig> . we thus applied a luciferase reporter assay to verify that mir- <dig> was directly binding igf1r in rgc- <dig> cells .

we then speculated igf1r might be directly involved in the modulation of mir- <dig> on rgc- <dig> apoptosis. in order to examine that, we constructed sirna to specifically knock down igf1r gene in rgc- <dig> cells . after applying  <dig> nm igf1r-sirna or its non-specific control sirna  in rgc- <dig> cells for 48 hours, we examined the knocking down efficiency by western blotting analysis. our results showed that igf1r protein was significantly reduced by igf1r-sirna . the results also showed that down-regulation of igf1r induced phosphorylation of akt, whereas the total protein of akt was unchanged .

finally, we examined the effect of knocking down igf1r on mir- <dig> regulation and rgc- <dig> apoptosis. we pre-treated rgc- <dig> cells with either igf1r-sirna  or nc-sirna  for 24 hours, followed by h2o <dig>  treatment for another 24 hours. the results showed that the mrna expression level of mir- <dig>  presumably up-regulated upon apoptosis, was significantly down-regulated by knocking down igf1r in rgc- <dig> cells . moreover, the percentage of apoptotic rgc- <dig> was markedly reduced by knocking down igf1r, from 78% to 33% .

discussion
oxidative stress has been suggested to be a major mechanism causing rgc degeneration  <cit> , and the application of h2o <dig> is known to induce apoptosis among cultured rgcs. in the present study, we utilized an in vitro culture system to induce rgc- <dig> apoptosis through h2o <dig> and found that mir- <dig> was up-regulated by h2o <dig> in a dose-dependent manner. it has been commonly shown in the literature that mir- <dig> is an active factor in cancer regulation, modulating carcinoma development, metastasis or apoptosis  <cit> . in retina, though mir- <dig> is expressed, little is known of its molecular mechanism  <cit> . in the present study, not only did we show an active change in expression profile of mir- <dig> upon h2o2-induced apoptosis, but we also demonstrated that down-regulation of mir- <dig> had a protective effect on rgc- <dig> apoptosis. thus, these results highlighted a first ever report on functional role of mir- <dig> in retina.

also in the present study we showed that, during h2o2-induced apoptosis, down-regulating mir- <dig> activated trkb signaling pathways and its downstream akt/erk pathways, through phosphorylation. thus, it is likely that mir- <dig> downregulation may serve a role of trkb agonist to exert a protective effect on h2o2-induced apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells. this hypothesis was further supported by our results showing mir- <dig> down-regulation promoted neurite growth, possibly induced neural differentiation in rgc- <dig> cells, as trkb activation is known to induce maturation in retina  <cit> . however, to elucidate the exact molecular interaction between mir- <dig> and trkb/akt/erk pathways in protecting retinal ganglion apoptosis, future experiments of blocking trkb or its downstream pathways upon the inhibition of mir- <dig> would provide solid evidence on direct targeting of mir- <dig> on anti-apoptotic pathways in retinal ganglion cells.

through online bioinformatics search, as well as our luciferase assay and functional experiments , we further revealed that igf1r was very likely to be directly involved in the modulation of mir- <dig> on h2o2-induced apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells. furthermore, our results demonstrated that sirna-mediated igf1r knockdown activated akt pathway and rescued h2o2-induced apoptosis. this is consistent with previous study showing that igf1r mutant mice had increased lifespan and significant resistance to oxidative stress in retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . interestingly, our experiment also showed that knocking down igf1r was able to down-regulate mir- <dig>  this result suggests that, instead of being downstream target of mir- <dig>  igf1r might be mutually interacted with mir- <dig> in regulating rgc apoptosis, acting through mir- <dig> itself or its upstream pathways. along with our early results demonstrating the functional association between mir- <dig> and akt/erk/trkb pathways, a much more complex molecular network might be involved in the regulation of mir- <dig> in retina.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study identified a novel regulator, mir- <dig> in modulating apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. the method of down-regulating mir- <dig> might help to further our understanding on the mechanisms of degeneration and regeneration in retina tissues.
