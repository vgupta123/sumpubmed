BACKGROUND
transcription factors  regulate gene expression by binding selectively to dna sequences in promoters, and genes regulated by the same tfs have been assumed to share the common binding sites in their promoter regions and exhibit similar expression patterns  <cit> . numerous experimental and computational studies  <cit>  have been done on locating transcriptional regulator dna binding sequences and understanding their working mechanisms. these binding motifs can be used as building blocks of gene regulatory networks and several approaches were developed to identify how a set of cis-regulatory elements in a gene's promoter region governed its behavior and explained the observed expression profiles  <cit> . using different approaches, segal et al.  <cit>  and beer and tavazoie  <cit>  both showed that a substantial fraction of yeast gene expression profiles could be explained in terms of the combination of cis-regulatory elements. however, a limitation of such approaches is that many genes are posttranscriptionally regulated  <cit> . the progresses have been made in mapping transcriptional regulatory networks in recent years, whereas posttranscriptional regulatory roles just begin to be uncovered  <cit> . posttranscriptional regulation through rna-rna interaction has arrested much attention due to the discovery of micrornas .

mirnas regulate gene expression by inducing mrna cleavage or translational repression of their targets  <cit> . plant mirnas are usually perfectly complementary to their targets and cause the cleavage of their targets by rna-induced silencing complex , whereas in animals targets with weaker complementarities appear to have decreased translational efficacy  <cit> . however, the role of mirna in regulatory networks needs to be further explored  <cit> . to address this need, we introduced a combinatorial approach to determine the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory elements based on gene expression profiles.

various plant growth and development processes are critically influenced by light  <cit> . wild type arabidopsis seedling development follows two patterns, etiolation in darkness and photomorphogenesis in the light  <cit> . cop/det/fus  is a class of genes which were identified as downstream signalling components of all photoreceptors  <cit> . mutation in cop/det/fus causes constitutive photomorphogenic development even in the dark  <cit> . one important light-signalling component involved in plant light responses is cop <dig>  <cit> , which regulates not only photomorphogenesis but also other developmental processes. the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype of cop <dig> mutation indicates that cop <dig> acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis  <cit> .

we applied this approach to a constitutive photomorphogenic <dig>  mutant time course microarray dataset to detect sequence elements that selectively bind to tfs and mirnas in the process. inspired by beer and tavazoie  <cit> , we used bayesian network â€“ a probabilistic model to integrate gene expression profiles, transcription factor binding sites  as well as mirna target motifs to deduce the combination of sequence elements that modulate gene expression, and we tried to explain the observed gene expression profiles in terms of the adopted motifs. firstly, we conducted a genome-wide screening to detect potential mirna target motifs in arabidopsis based on an inhomogeneous hidden markov model , and cross-species conservation as well as minimum binding energy of mirna/mrna duplex were used as additional filters to reduce the rate of false positives. secondly, genes in the cop <dig> mutant time course microarray dataset were clustered into  <dig> expression patterns and overrepresented sequence elements in the upstream of the genes belonged to the same cluster were detected using alignace  <cit> . thirdly, bayesian network strategy was applied to selecting these motifs in both upstream sequences and transcript sequences that were most related to the gene expression patterns. lastly, we measured the degree to which gene expression could be determined merely by these adopted regulatory motifs. figure  <dig> illustrated the flow diagram of the approach.

RESULTS
mirna target motifs in arabidopsis
various algorithms developed to predict plant mirna targets are on the same basis that mirnas and their targets are perfectly complementary, and most of the algorithms predict mirna targets through detecting transcripts that have less than or equal to  <dig> mismatches to mirnas  <cit> . however, there are natural targets with  <dig> mismatches  <cit> , which are not able to be found by these algorithms. moreover, we believe that sequences with the same number of mismatches to a mirna might not have the same probability to be cleaved by the mirna owing to the mechanism of risc. in several cases, particular mirna-target mismatches are conserved through the evolutionary distance that separates arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , suggesting that certain mismatches might be under positive selective pressure rather than merely being tolerated. furthermore, properly placed mismatches might improve the enzyme turnover rate  <cit> .

we chose hmm because of its capability of capturing the position specific information about particular matches/mismatches. in spite of the variable mirna sequences, the complementarities between mirna-target duplex might follow some rules according to the risc mechanisms, and we believed that the hmm could be used to find these hidden rules by learning from a training set of potential mirna targets of only  <dig> mature mirnas contained in mirbase  <dig> , a three years old release, and in this way we also assessed the ability of our method to extrapolate from a limited prior knowledge  <cit> . to obtain the training set, we set the maximum number of mismatches tolerated at  <dig>  and the direct search detected  <dig> genes whose mrnas had the complementary sites with at least one of the  <dig> mirnas. the  <dig> mirna-target candidates were used as training data. the baum-welch algorithm estimated the transition and emission probabilities and the optimal state chains of each of the mirna-mrna pair were computed using viterbi algorithm, which represented possible mirna-target duplexes that could be recognized by risc and cleaved by its argonaute component.

totally  <dig> non-redundant optimal state chains were produced by using viterbi algorithm, which were much less than the number of possible chains that randomly allowed up to  <dig> mismatches for a  <dig> mer mrna. after scanning the genome, we found about  <dig>  potential mirna target motifs for all the  <dig> mirnas in the mirbase newest release . this result covered almost all the experimentally validated mirna targets  in arabidopsis  <cit> . to reduce the false positive rate of our hmm predictions we used the cross-species conservation and minimum binding energy of mirna/mrna duplex to do two rounds of filtering. there are  <dig>   <dig> hmm predictions passed through the first round of selection, and among them  <dig>  passed through the second round of selection. almost all of the  <dig> experimentally validated mirna targets  passed through the first round of selection, and among them  <dig> passed through the second round of selection. the majority of the  <dig> experimentally validated mirna targets  were the targets for those mirnas that were not included in the training set.

we did simulation study by random shuffling of mirna sequences to test whether our method could distinguish a mirna from its shuffled version during the detecting process. two kinds of randomly shuffled sequences were generated, i.e. monoshuffled and dishuffled sequences. the monoshuffling method generated a truly permuted random sequence while the dishuffling method further made the count of each dinucleotide the same as that of mirnas. fifty cohorts of randomly shuffled sequences were generated. the noise to signal ratio  was  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. the detailed simulation results are available in our supplemental web page .

discovery of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory motifs in cop <dig> mutant time course microarray data
in the cop <dig> mutant time course experiment, there were in total  <dig> time points, i.e. 0th hour, 12th hour, 24th hour, 36th hour, 48th hour, 60th hour, 72nd hour, 4th day, 5th day and 6th day. the log expression ratio reflected the difference between the expression level of cop <dig> mutant and that of wildtype for each gene.

maximal log likelihood value obtained by bic showed that the optimal number of clusters was  <dig>  so we divided the  <dig>  genes into  <dig> clusters using gqlcluster  <cit> . each cluster contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the mean expression profiles were calculated for each cluster , and the  <dig> gene clusters and their mean expression profiles are available in our supplemental data web page . sequences that were  <dig> bp upstream of transcription start sites  were retrieved for each gene and tfbss were detected using alignace for the genes belonged to the same cluster. the computer program scanace  with default parameters was used to identify the tfbss in the upstream region of each gene. the predicted tfbss for each cluster are available in our supplemental data web page. we also added  <dig> known hexamer motifs described in gao et al.  <cit>  to the tfbs dataset.

the tfbss and mirna target motifs were fed to the bayesian network model and the models weighted sequence motifs according to their contribution to the expression profiles. there had been no evidence that the tf binding to a gene's upstream region could also posttranscriptionally affect its cleavage by mirna and vice versa, therefore the tfbss and mirna target motifs were treated independently in the network construction. no interaction is allowed between two motifs of different kinds. for tfbss, their distances to tsss, their orientations, copy numbers and the interaction between any two adopted tfbss are all taken into account. our microarray time course experiment was not specially designed to test mirna targets expression, so we gave upstream motifs the priority in the network construction. therefore, a network might only have upstream motif nodes without any mirna target nodes, but could not only have mirna target nodes instead. about 80% of the genes  were used to train the bayesian network model and the rest 20% genes  were used to estimate the proportion of the genes whose expression patterns could be correctly predicted by merely the adopted transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory motifs in the networks.

the average number of nodes was  <dig> for the  <dig> networks, and in average  <dig> were upstream motif nodes and  <dig> were mirna target nodes . the most frequent constraints added to each tfbs node was its distance to tss. two known upstream motif nodes had been added, respectively, to two networks, namely myb1at to network  <dig> and i-box to network  <dig>  totally  <dig> mirna target nodes were adopted by the  <dig> networks.

predicting gene expression patterns
we used the upstream motif nodes and the mirna target nodes adopted in the bayesian network model to predict gene expression patterns. each of the  <dig>  genes was assigned to the respective network with the highest probability p. some expression patterns were quite similar; hence we calculated the correlation coefficient of the mean expression pattern between any two of the  <dig> clusters. if two expression patterns have a correlation coefficient greater than  <dig> , they are regarded as overlapped expression patterns. we regarded overlapped expression patterns as in a single cluster, in this way we classified the  <dig> expression patterns into  <dig> qualitative distinguished super-clusters . a gene assigned to the correct super-cluster would be regarded as correctly predicted  <cit> .

more than 50% genes  were correctly assigned. we did simulation study by randomly assigning the  <dig>  genes to the  <dig> super-clusters for  <dig>  times. the number of correctly assigned genes was  <dig> in average, and the p-value of correctly assigning  <dig> genes was less than 1e- <dig>  moreover,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes could still be correctly assigned without mirna nodes and the introducing of mirna nodes could further correctly assigned  <dig> genes. we retrieved the functional annotation of these  <dig> genes and found that two genes  have the annotation term "dna or rna binding" in the go  <cit> . furthermore, we made a 5-fold cross validation test and the average number of correctly assigned genes was  <dig> 

discussion
transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory networks
we applied our method to shorter promoter regions; say  <dig> upstream to  <dig> downstream of each tss. and the accuracy of the expression pattern prediction with  region is lower than that of  region. only  <dig> genes could be correctly assigned to its respective expression pattern; and without the integration of mirna nodes,  <dig> genes could be correctly assigned merely based on tfbss nodes.

most genomic studies of gene expression regulation focus on transcriptional rather than on posttranscriptional regulation. based on a model in which upstream motifs contribute additively to the log-expression level of a gene, bussemaker presented a computational method  <cit>  for discovering cis-regulatory elements that circumvented the need to cluster genes based on their profiles. beer and tavazoie  <cit>  correctly predicted 70% of the gene expression patterns by use of bayesian network only based on upstream motifs. li et al. developed a promoter classification method using a relevance vector machine  and bayesian statistical principles to identify discriminatory features in the promoter sequences of genes that could classify transcriptional responses and they correctly predicted 70% genes as being up- or down-regulated  <cit> , based on a small set of discriminative promoter motifs.

in the meanwhile, foat et al. identified functional 3' utr motifs  that best correlated with the observed changes in mrna levels  <cit> . sood et al. used computational methods to explore the effects of endogenous mirna expression on endogenous steady-state mrna levels  <cit> . in their model, changes in mrna levels of a given gene  are written as a sum over contributions from all sequence motifs in the 3' utr of that gene, which could explain changes in mrna levels for 50% genes. in order to understand the importance of srnas in gene regulation, levine et al.  <cit>  studied examples from two distinct classes of bacterial srnas based on a quantitative approach combining experiments and theory. their results suggested that srna provides a distinct mode of gene regulation from that of protein-mediated one.

although beer and tavazoie as well as rajewsky  <cit>  all suggested the integration of posttranscriptional and transcriptional motifs in the future studies of gene regulatory networks, respectively, <cit>  none of the aforementioned groups had correlated both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory elements together with the gene expression data. recently hobert  <cit>  briefly reviewed the principles of tf and mirna working mechanisms and how they control gene expression.

plant mirna target prediction
in the rhoades et al.'s study  <cit> , random permutation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method of plant mirna target prediction. annotated arabidopsis mrnas were searched for targets for  <dig> arabidopsis mirnas. identical searches with  <dig> cohorts of  <dig> randomized mirnas were also performed. when constrained to 0â€“ <dig> mismatches,  <dig> targets were predicted for  <dig> mirnas, whereas in average  <dig>  targets were predicted for the cohorts of random sequences, which gave a noise to signal ratio of  <dig>  . when the number of mismatches was exactly  <dig> in their prediction method, the ratio became  <dig>  . in our simulation study using two different shuffling methods , the noise to signal ratio  were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.

if the number of mismatches allowed in rhoades et al.'s method was  <dig> to  <dig>  our method may generate more false positives , which might be due to the fact that our hmm method allows for more mismatches. however, when the number of mismatches was fixed at  <dig> in rhoades et al.'s method, the noise to signal ratio increased to  <dig> . our proposed hmm method of plant mirna target prediction allows for more than four mismatches in the target sequences, however, we proposed this method here as an alternative instead of a replacement of the published method, since the hmm method may increase the number of false positive predictions due to the allowance of more than  <dig> mismatches.

contribution of mirnas in gene regulation networks
in our study, 3% of the  <dig> genes could only be correctly assigned after introducing mirna nodes, which might suggest that the consequence of mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation was marginal in our time course expression profiles though mirna is considered as one of the most important posttranscriptional gene regulators. this might result from a possible bias in the predictive power of tfbs since the motif finding was done for each fixed cluster. in view of this, we did a reference test using only the aforementioned  <dig> known hexamer motifs  <cit>  and mirna target motifs. using the  <dig> known hexamer motifs, we could only correctly assign  <dig> genes, which was even less than that from random assignment  and this suggested that the observed expression profiles could not be explained solely by the combination of the  <dig> known motifs. after adding mirna target nodes, we could correctly assign  <dig> genes . the result suggested that mirnas might confer additional layers of robustness on gene regulation networks. exploration of mirna regulatory mechanism together with known transcriptional regulatory interactions and other functional genomics data might help to further elucidate the function of mirnas at a system-wide level  <cit> .

the  <dig> genes, which could only be correctly assigned once mirna nodes were adopted, might have functions related to mirna regulation mechanism. we retrieved the functional annotation of these  <dig> genes and found that three of them, namely at5g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> are experimentally validated mirna targets. furthermore, we grouped these genes based on their go annotations . it is not surprising to find that both functional annotation terms "dna or rna binding" and "transcriptional factor activity" are enriched as it is well-known that plant mirnas are biased toward to target tfs and other regulatory genes  <cit> . functional annotation of "response to abiotic or biotic stimulus" and "response to stress" are also significantly enriched , which is consistent with the fact that mirnas play important roles in plant responses to environmental stresses as well as in development and genome maintenance  <cit> .

the p-values were adjusted for multiple tests using bonferroni correction.

CONCLUSIONS
aiming at integrating transcription factor binding motifs and posttranscriptional regulatory motifs toward a better quantitative modeling of changes in mrna level, we proposed a probabilistic approach to determine the context-dependent role of genomic tf binding motifs together with mirna binding motifs in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. regardless the simple strategy employed, our method may provide an incomplete or coarse-grained portrait of the underlying transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory network. consequently, our method facilitated the incorporation of diverse sources with limited prior knowledge. the relationship between sequence motifs and gene expression profiles could be investigated more precisely from datasets that observe expression profiles of mirnas, mrnas and proteins from the same samples simultaneously. other posttranscriptional mechanisms, such as alternative splicing, may also be taken into considerations in the further network construction.
