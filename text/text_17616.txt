BACKGROUND
in saccharomyces cerevisiae, defective dna replication stimulates homologous recombination , suggesting that the lesions that accumulate following replication failure are substrates for hr
 <cit> . rad <dig> is a structure-specific endonuclease
 <cit>  required for completion of lagging strand synthesis
 <cit> , and has also been implicated in base excision repair
 <cit> , and double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining
 <cit> . loss of rad <dig> leads to accumulation of single-stranded gaps or nicks on daughter dna strands
 <cit> . collision of replication forks with these lesions results in fork collapse and generation of double-strand breaks 
 <cit>  that can stimulate hr. importantly, concomitant loss of rad <dig> and components of the hr apparatus leads to synthetic lethality
 <cit> . these observations implicate hr in repair of dsbs that accumulate in the absence of rad <dig>  failure to repair dsbs leads to chromosome loss
 <cit>  that is greatly stimulated in rad <dig> null mutant cells
 <cit> , suggesting that the essential role for the hr apparatus in rad <dig> mutants may be prevention of lethal levels of chromosome loss.

rad <dig> encodes a protein that augments the ability of rad <dig>  the central hr protein in yeast
 <cit> , to anneal complementary dna strands in vitro <cit> , and both are required for viability in rad <dig> null mutant cells
 <cit> . rad <dig> and rad <dig> are also required to repair dsbs by single-strand annealing 
 <cit> , and hr between inverted repeats by an annealing-dependent template switch at stalled replication forks
 <cit> . since rad <dig> exerts much of its effect on hr with rad <dig> <cit> , the function of rad <dig> required in the absence of rad <dig> may be in collaboration with rad <dig> 

the purpose of the current study was to explore the function of rad <dig> required for the viability of rad <dig> null mutant cells. we investigated how four rad <dig> mutations previously characterized with respect to their effects on ssa
 <cit> , affected survivorship when combined with a rad <dig> null mutation. we found that rad59-k166a, which alters an amino acid in a conserved, putative α-helical domain
 <cit> , was synthetically lethal in combination with rad <dig>  because rad59-k166a diminishes association of rad <dig> with dsbs
 <cit> , this may be a function required for the viability of rad <dig> null mutant cells. the rad59-k174a and rad59-f180a mutations, which alter amino acids in the same α-helical domain, and have genetically similar effects on ssa
 <cit> , were not synthetically lethal with rad <dig>  but resulted in distinct effects on growth that correlated with their degree of inhibition of hr. this strongly implicates rad59-dependent hr as a requirement for viability in rad <dig> null mutant cells. the rad59-y92a mutation, which alters an amino acid in a separate, conserved loop domain and confers genetically distinct effects on ssa
 <cit>  was not synthetically lethal with rad <dig>  and had a stimulatory effect on hr. this effect was genetically equivalent to that of a null allele of srs <dig>  which encodes a helicase that disassembles rad51-dna filaments
 <cit> , suggesting that rad <dig> may affect association of rad <dig> with replication lesions. the distinct effects of the rad <dig> alleles suggest that rad <dig> possesses multiple, discrete roles in responding to the consequences of dysfunctional replication.

RESULTS
the rad <dig> mutant alleles display distinct effects on survival and growth in cells defective for lagging strand synthesis
to further explore the function of rad <dig> required for viability in rad <dig> null mutant cells, the effects of combining the rad27::leu <dig> allele with the various rad <dig> alleles were determined by examining their ability to yield viable spores upon co-segregation in genetic crosses. the various rad27/rad27::leu <dig> rad59/rad <dig> double heterozygotes were sporulated and tetrads dissected onto rich medium . as observed previously, the rad27::leu <dig> and rad59::leu <dig> alleles did not appear together in any of the colonies arising from the spores, consistent with synthetic lethality
 <cit> . the rad59-k166a allele, which alters a conserved lysine in the region of rad <dig> that corresponds to the α-helical domain of the β − β − β − α motif of human rad <dig> 
 <cit>  displayed the same failure to appear with the rad27::leu <dig> allele, indicative of synthetic lethality.

the rad59-k174a and rad59-f180a alleles alter conserved amino acids in the same putative α-helical domain as rad59-k166a but were able to form viable spores upon segregation with rad27::leu <dig> . doubling time of the rad27::leu <dig> rad59-f180a double mutant was a statistically significant  24% longer than that observed for the rad <dig> single mutant, which correlated with a ratio of g <dig> to s + g2/m cells that was a statistically significant   <dig> -fold lower . in contrast, doubling time of the rad27::leu <dig> rad59-k174a double mutant was not significantly different from that of the rad27::leu <dig> single mutant  .

doubling times of freshly dissected segregants were determined as described in the methods. displayed for each genotype is the median doubling time and 95% confidence interval, determined from at least ten independent cultures.

the rad59-y92a allele alters a conserved amino acid in another region of extensive conservation with rad <dig> 
 <cit> , and was observed to yield viable spores upon segregation with rad27::leu <dig> . while the colonies derived from the rad27::leu <dig> rad59-y92a double mutant spores sometimes appeared smaller than the rad27::leu <dig> single mutant colonies on dissection plates, neither the doubling times  , nor the ratios of g <dig> to s + g2/m cells   were significantly different for the rad27::leu <dig> single and rad27::leu <dig> rad59-y92a double mutant strains. this suggests that germination of rad27::leu <dig> rad59-y92a double mutant spores may sometimes take longer than rad27::leu <dig> single mutant spores. we did not observe significant effects of the tested rad <dig> missense alleles on doubling time  , or cell cycle distribution   in cells that possessed a wild-type rad <dig> gene. since all four rad <dig> missense mutations support steady-state levels of rad <dig> that are comparable to wild-type
 <cit> , their effects on viability and growth when combined with rad27::leu <dig> cannot be attributed to changes in the level of rad <dig> in the cell. altogether, these observations suggest that rad <dig> plays a critical role in determining the growth characteristics of cells defective for lagging strand synthesis.

the rad <dig> alleles affect a rad51-dependent mechanism for repairing replication lesions
the central strand exchange factor, rad51
 <cit> , is often required for mechanisms of hr that require rad <dig>  including those involved in spontaneous hr between inverted and unlinked repeat sequences
 <cit> . like rad <dig>  an intact rad <dig> gene is necessary for viability in rad27::leu <dig> mutant cells
 <cit> , suggesting that rad51-dependent hr plays a critical role in responding to replication lesions. accordingly, loss of rad <dig> results in increases in hr events that require rad <dig> <cit> . we used an assay that measures spontaneous ectopic gene conversion involving unlinked, mutant alleles of the sam <dig> gene
 <cit>  to examine effects of the rad27::leu <dig> mutation on hr in haploid strains . loss of rad <dig> resulted in a dramatic,  <dig> -fold increased rate of ectopic gene conversion , indicating that accumulation of replication lesions can greatly stimulate hr between unlinked sequences.

the robust stimulatory effect of the loss of the rad <dig> gene on ectopic gene conversion suggested that it could be used for examining the relationship between hr, and growth in the viable rad <dig> rad <dig> double mutants. as observed previously
 <cit> , the rad59::leu <dig> mutation conferred a statistically significant  <dig> -fold reduction in the rate of ectopic gene conversion , confirming that rad <dig> plays a role in spontaneous hr between unlinked repeats. while neither the rad59-k174a nor rad59-f180a mutations had significant effects on their own, they led to significant,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold reductions in the stimulatory effect of the rad27::leu <dig> allele in the rad27::leu <dig> rad59-k174a and rad27::leu <dig> rad59-f180a double mutants , suggesting that they confer defects in the utilization of replication lesions by hr.

in contrast to the rad59-k174a and rad59-f180a mutations, the rad59-y92a mutation caused an 86-fold increased rate of spontaneous ectopic gene conversion , and, when combined with the rad27::leu <dig> mutation, stimulated the rate of ectopic gene conversion by a statistically significant  <dig> -fold over that observed in the rad27::leu <dig> single mutant . the synergistically increased rate of ectopic gene conversion in the rad27::leu <dig> rad59-y92a double mutant is consistent with rad59-y92a stimulating hr by a mechanism distinct from the accumulation of replication lesions that results from loss of rad <dig> 

the hyper-rec effects of the rad59-y92a and srs2::trp <dig> alleles are genetically equivalent
previous work indicating that rad59-y92a decreases spontaneous rad51-independent hr between directly repeated sequences
 <cit>  suggests that the stimulation of ectopic gene conversion is not due to accumulation of recombinogenic lesions. ectopic gene conversion requires rad <dig> to work after lesion formation to catalyze the strand invasion that begins the interaction between unlinked sequences that will repair the lesion
 <cit> . if stimulation of hr by rad59-y92a is the result of changes subsequent to rad51-dna filament formation, loss of rad <dig> should abolish the stimulatory effect. the rate of ectopic gene conversion in the rad51::leu <dig> rad59-y92a double mutant was reduced 50-fold from wild-type, which was nearly identical to the rate in rad51::leu <dig> single mutant cells . therefore, stimulation by rad59-y92a requires formation of rad51-dna filaments.

like the rad59-y92a mutation, a null allele of the srs <dig> gene, which encodes a dna helicase
 <cit>  that facilitates the disassembly of rad51-dna filaments
 <cit> , has been shown to stimulate spontaneous gene conversion between non-allelic sequences
 <cit> . consistent with this, we observed a 31-fold increased rate of spontaneous ectopic gene conversion in an srs2::trp <dig> mutant . as the effects of srs2::trp <dig> and rad59-y92a were similar we examined ectopic gene conversion in the srs <dig> rad59-y92a double mutant and observed a 38-fold increase over wild-type that was not significantly different from the rates in the srs2::trp <dig> or rad59-y92a single mutants . this indicates that rad59-y92a and srs2::trp <dig> are mutually epistatic.

rad59-y92a is a dominant mutation that stimulates rad51-dependent hr between homologs
rad51-dependent hr between sister-chromatids and homologous chromosomes are thought to be the primary mechanisms for rescuing lesions, and supporting viability in rad <dig> mutant cells
 <cit> . one form of inter-homolog hr that requires rad <dig> is recombination between mutant alleles at the same locus, referred to as heteroallelic recombination
 <cit> . accordingly, the rate of spontaneous recombination between heteroalleles of the sam <dig> gene was reduced  <dig> -fold in the rad51::leu2/rad51::leu <dig> homozygote . consistent with its effect on ectopic gene conversion, loss of rad <dig> increased the rate of heteroallelic recombination  <dig> -fold, confirming that accumulation of replication lesions robustly stimulates heteroallelic recombination
 <cit> .

similar to its effect on ectopic gene conversion, we observed that rad59-y92a increased the rate of heteroallelic recombination by 19-fold . interestingly, the effect of rad59-y92a was dominant with respect to rad <dig>  as the rate in the rad59/rad59-y92a heterozygote was not significantly different from that in the rad59-y92a/rad59-y92a homozygote. like with ectopic gene conversion, combining the rad27::leu <dig> and rad59-y92a alleles in the rad27/rad27 rad59-y92a/rad59-y92a double homozygote had a synergistic effect on heteroallelic recombination, increasing the rate 25-fold over that observed in the rad27::leu2/rad27::leu <dig> homozygote. this astonishing,  <dig> -fold increased rate of heteroallelic recombination corresponds to a median frequency of recombination where 85% of the surviving colonies are recombinants.

the rad <dig> alleles do not affect a variety of genome destabilizing processes stimulated by the accumulation of replication lesions
loss of rad <dig> stimulates a variety of mutagenic and clastogenic events
 <cit> . the rate of spontaneous mutation at the can <dig> locus is greatly increased in rad27::leu <dig> mutant cells
 <cit> . characterization of these mutations revealed that the majority are short duplications flanked by short, directly repeated sequences that may be created by multiple hr mechanisms
 <cit> . our data confirm the previous analyses as we observed a 50-fold increased rate of spontaneous mutation at the can <dig> locus in a rad27::leu <dig> mutant . in contrast, the rad59::leu <dig>  rad59-y92a, rad59-k174a, and rad59-f180a alleles did not have significant effects on the rate of can <dig> mutation, nor did the missense alleles have significant effects when combined with the rad27::leu <dig> allele.

rates of can <dig> mutation or uscr were determined from at least  <dig> independent cultures as described in the methods. the 95% confidence intervals are in parentheses. fold decreases  and increases  from wild-type are in brackets. n.d. – not determined.

loss of rad <dig> has been previously observed to strongly stimulate unequal sister chromatid recombination  
 <cit> . we observed a 47-fold increased rate of uscr in rad27::leu <dig> cells , confirming the previous results, while loss of rad <dig> had no significant effect. the rad59::leu <dig>  rad59-y92a, rad59-k174a, and rad59-f180a alleles did not have significant effects on the rate of uscr, nor did the missense mutations have effects in combination with rad27::leu <dig>  suggesting that rad <dig> does not influence this mechanism of genome rearrangement.

disrupting lagging strand synthesis by imposing a defect in the processivity of pol δ, or loss of rad <dig>  was shown previously to substantially increase rates of loss of heterozygosity  by chromosome loss, and hr between homologs
 <cit> . in the present analysis, loh was examined in diploid strains by simultaneously monitoring changes in the genetic state at three loci on chromosome v  in order to separately determine rates of chromosome loss , terminal loh , and interstitial loh  . rates of all three events increased substantially in rad27::leu2/rad27::leu <dig> homozygotes; chromosome loss increased 12-fold, terminal loh increased 37-fold, and interstitial loh increased 11-fold, strongly suggesting that replication lesions stimulate hr between homologs when they are repaired, and chromosome loss when they are not. interestingly, we observed an 18-fold increase in the rate of chromosome loss in rad51::leu2/rad51::leu <dig> homozygotes, consistent with a requirement for rad <dig> in the rescue of broken chromosomes. in contrast, loss of rad <dig> did not have significant effects on interstitial loh or terminal loh, indicating that these inter-chromosomal hr events do not require rad <dig> 

rates of interstitial loh , terminal loh , and chromosome loss  from a minimum of  <dig> independent cultures were determined as described in the methods. the 95% confidence intervals are in parentheses. fold decreases  and increases  from wild-type are in brackets.

as observed above for mutation and uscr , the rad59-y92a, rad59-k174a, and rad59-f180a alleles had no significant effect on the rates of interstitial loh, terminal loh, and chromosome loss in the rad59/rad <dig> single mutants, or in the double mutant combinations with the rad27::leu <dig> allele . similarly, rad59::leu <dig> had no significant effect on the rates of interstitial loh and terminal loh, but conferred a small , statistically significant increase in chromosome loss. these data suggest that rad <dig> has little influence on these mechanisms of loh.

discussion
we have explored the role of rad <dig> in mediating responses to dna lesions that accumulate in rad27::leu <dig> mutant cells, and found that it supports multiple, genetically separable functions. like the rad59::leu <dig> allele, we found that the rad59-k166a allele, which alters a lysine in a conserved, putative α-helical domain 
 <cit> , results in synthetic lethality when combined with the rad27::leu <dig> allele . in previous experiments, we found that rad27::leu <dig> mutant cells display a profusion of dsbs
 <cit> . as both rad59::leu <dig> and rad59-k166a substantially reduce association of rad <dig> with dsbs
 <cit> , we speculate that a critical reduction in the association of rad <dig> with the many dsbs in rad27::leu <dig> rad59::leu <dig> and rad27::leu <dig> rad59-k166a double mutants may inhibit their rescue by hr, and results in a lethal level of chromosome loss. the rad59-f180a and rad59-k174a alleles, which change conserved residues in the same α-helical domain altered by rad59-k166a, may have incrementally less severe effects on association of rad <dig> with dsbs. this may result in their serially reduced inhibition of repair of replication-induced dsbs by hr  and commensurate effects on growth  when combined with rad <dig>  an accumulation of rad27::leu <dig> rad59-f180a double mutant cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, as compared to rad27::leu <dig> single mutant or rad27::leu <dig> rad59-k174a double mutant cells is consistent with more deficient repair of replication-induced dsbs by hr . this further supports the notion that rad <dig> promotes the survival of rad27::leu <dig> mutant cells by facilitating the rescue of replication lesions by hr. recently, rad <dig> has been shown to be required for the viability of dna ligase i-deficient mutants, verifying the requirement for this factor in accommodating to incomplete dna replication
 <cit> .

in striking contrast to the other rad <dig> alleles, rad59-y92a stimulated hr . this hyper-recombinogenic effect was distinct from that caused by rad <dig> as it was not accompanied by significant effects on doubling time , cell cycle profile , mutation , unequal sister chromatid exchange, or loh , suggesting that rad59-y92a does not cause an accumulation of replication lesions. the observation that the stimulatory effect of rad59-y92a was completely suppressed by a null allele of rad <dig>  and was mutually epistatic with a null allele of srs <dig> , suggests that rad59-y92a may increase hr by increasing the stability of rad51-dna filaments, perhaps by changing its interaction with rad <dig> . an increase in dsbs combined with an increase in the stability of rad <dig> filaments at the dsbs may underlay the synergistically increased rates of hr observed in rad <dig> rad59-y92a double mutants . however, since rad <dig> also interacts with rpa
 <cit>  and rsc
 <cit> , the increase in hr observed in rad59-y92a mutant cells may also involve changes in additional processes.

while our results support a prominent role for rad59-dependent hr in the repair of replication lesions in rad27::leu <dig> mutants, hr mechanisms that do not depend on rad <dig> were also strongly stimulated in rad27::leu <dig> mutants. in particular, inter-chromosomal hr leading to interstitial and terminal loh events was strongly stimulated by rad <dig>  but was unaffected by the rad <dig> alleles . inter-chromosomal hr leading to loh is thought to occur by break-induced replication 
 <cit> . bir has been proposed to utilize a single-ended dsb on one homolog to generate a replication fork-like intermediate with the unbroken homolog that may potentially proceed until reaching the end of the donor chromosome 
 <cit> . in contrast, rad59-dependent heteroallelic recombination is thought to utilize a double-ended dsb where both ends are rescued, either through concerted interactions with the unbroken homolog, or through the first end interacting with the homolog followed by the second end annealing with the first after gaining sequences copied from the unbroken homolog . the stimulation of both mechanisms of hr between homologs suggests that loss of rad <dig> leads to the accumulation of both single- and double-ended dsbs. dsbs may arise when the failure to remove flaps on the 5′ ends of okazaki fragments leads to accumulation of nicks on newly replicated lagging strands . persistence of these nicks into the subsequent cell cycle will leave discontinuities on the template for leading strand synthesis that will stall replication and form single-ended dsbs. if a second replication fork from an adjacent replicon collides with the first stalled fork, a double-ended dsb can arise. a genome-wide increase in replication-induced dsb formation, like that induced by many chemotherapeutic agents, would therefore require a robust response by the hr apparatus to prevent chromosome loss, potentially explaining the critical role of hr in determining sensitivity to these drugs in humans
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rad <dig> encodes one of several homologous recombination  factors required for viability of budding yeast cells lacking the dna replication factor, rad <dig>  this demonstrates that the hr apparatus is required to prevent the lethal effects of dysfunctional replication, but no link between a specific hr mechanism and survival has been previously established. in this analysis, we show that two rad <dig> alleles that diminish association of rad <dig> with double-strand breaks are synthetically lethal with rad <dig>  while two others coordinately reduce rad51-dependent hr and growth, thus linking rad51-dependent repair with survival. another allele stimulates hr by stabilizing rad51-dna filaments. therefore, rad <dig> influences the repair of replication lesions by hr through its interactions with multiple hr factors. we speculate that the massive increase in replication failure genome-wide that results from loss of rad <dig> may be similar to that caused by chemotherapeutic agents in human cells, potentially explaining why the hr apparatus is critical in determining sensitivity to these drugs.
