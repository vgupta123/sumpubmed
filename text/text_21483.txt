BACKGROUND
endolysosomes are cellular organelles that play a key role in protein turnover and homeostasis of the cell. they are made up of a complex set of enzymes that break down proteins, lipids and sugars that are all essential for normal functioning of the cell  <cit> . a genetic mutation in some of these endolysosomal proteins can lead to disorders such as gaucher’s disease, niemann pick’s disease, and fabry disease  <cit> . endolysosomes also play a key role in antigen presentation by processing large proteins into epitopes that can be presented by mhc class i and class ii molecules  <cit> . therefore it is important to develop methodologies suitable to study specific endolysosomal functions in relevant cells and tissues.

several methods have been used to study their functions in the cell. the approaches taken to study endolysosome contribution to protein degradation include using recombinant cathepsins in peptide degradation assays  <cit> , studying the effect of cathepsin knock-out mice on the epitope repertoire  <cit> , and using purified endolysosomes from human tissue as a source of proteases for protein degradation assay  <cit> . in the case of endolysosomal storage disorders, knock-in mice expressing a mutated form of an enzyme have been used to study the role of specific proteins in disease  <cit> .

each of the above mentioned approaches have some caveats. endolysosomes comprise a complex set of proteases that are still not completely characterized. studying the role of a single protease and their contribution to antigen presentation using recombinant proteins is not representative of the complex milieu inside the organelle. gene knock-out or sirna studies are helpful in identifying the precise role of a particular protein but do not help in addressing the interactions between the different proteins in the organelle. though using purified endolysosomes will address the above-mentioned concerns, it involves a laborious, multistep process and results in a much lesser yield. in studies involving limited amount of material such as primary cells from patients, it may not be feasible to purify endolysosomes.

in this study, we describe a simple approach to test the contribution of endolysosomal proteases to protein degradation. since endolysosomal proteases are active in acidic ph  <cit> , we tested this characteristic by varying the ph in crude peripheral blood mononuclear cell  lysate by varying the ph and showed that endolysosomal cathepsin activity can be specifically activated at acidic ph. this simple yet efficient approach enabled us to test the contribution of endolysosomal proteases to several cellular functions using primary cells and therefore is physiologically relevant. we compared these low ph extracts to purified endolysosomes and found that both methodologies produced similar protease activities and peptide degradation kinetics. here, we exemplify the role of endolysosomes in antigen processing and highlight the potential usefulness of this method to study the function of endolysosomal enzymes in other functions and human diseases.

RESULTS
differential centrifugation of pbmc lysate yields pure endolysosomes
we purified endolysosomes from pbmc isolated from the blood of healthy donors. following differential centrifugation enrichment of lysosomes was confirmed by western blot by probing for lysosomal associated membrane protein  <dig>  and cathepsin s. quantification of the western blot bands showed a six-fold enrichment of cathepsin s in the endolysosomal fraction. this fraction was also devoid of cytosolic protein such as proteasome subunit α <dig> and actin, and displayed a five-fold reduced expression of endoplasmic reticulum protein, calnexin . to further confirm the enrichment of endolysosomes, the activities of cathepsin, chymotryptic activity of proteasomes and aminopeptidases were tested using a fluorescence-based activity assay using a fluorogenic peptidase-specific substrate   <cit> . the substrate, made of a short peptide linked to a fluorogenic coumarin derivative fluoresces only when the peptide is cleaved by the enzyme. the level of fluorescence emitted can be quantified over time. whereas a high level of proteasomal and aminopeptidase activities was detected in the lysosome-depleted cytosolic fraction, purified endolysosomes exhibited high cathepsin activity but no proteasomal activity and aminopeptidase activity . specificity of the substrate was measured by monitoring enzyme activity in the presence of specific or irrelevant inhibitors . each activity was strongly inhibited by the inhibitor for the relevant enzyme but not by the other inhibitors. thirdly, we measured acid phosphatase, an activity enriched in endolysosomes using a colorimetric assay  <cit> . acid phosphatase is one of the established lysosomal enzyme markers, and was used to monitor the level of lysosome enrichment in the isolated fractions following differential centrifugation  <cit> . comparison of phosphatase activities among different fractions showed that fractions  <dig> to  <dig> had the highest phosphatase activity, showing a ten-fold enrichment in acid phosphatase activity compared to the cytosolic fraction . these three independent approaches confirmed the isolation of endolysosomes and cytosol from crude pbmc lysate.

our previous studies established that short hiv peptides are variably sensitive to cytosolic degradation, a property that contributes to the efficient presentation of mhc-i epitopes  <cit> . we reasoned that due to differences in the peptidase content between cytosol  and endolysosomes  we may use differential peptide degradation as an additional approach to assess cytosolic and endolysosomal fraction purity, as well as a readout of endolysosomal hydrolytic activities that does not involve fluorogenic substrates. the percentage of acid phosphatase activity in each fraction was used to determine the number of cells that yielded endolysosomes in each fraction. for example, if fraction  <dig> consisted of 30% of the total acid phosphatase activity, it was assumed that 30% of the initial number of pbmc yielded the endolysosomal proteins in that fraction. using this information to calculate equivalent amounts of cytosol and endolysosome fractions purified from the same pbmc, we compared the degradation of two hiv p <dig> gag-derived epitopes: b27kk <dig> , and b57kf <dig>   <cit>  . the disappearance of the peptide was monitored by rp-hplc, where the amount of peptide is proportional to the surface area under its peak. upon degradation the peak area reduced and additional peaks corresponding to degradation products appeared  <cit> . the two hiv peptides were degraded faster in endolysosomes compared to the cytosol. the half-life of b57kf <dig> was  <dig> min in the cytosol and decreased to  <dig> min in endolysosomes. similarly, the half-life of b27kk <dig> was greater than  <dig> min in the cytosol and reduced to  <dig> min in the endolysosomes, suggesting that the distinct sets of peptidases present in cytosol and endolysosomes differently degraded the two peptides, also providing further evidence of the purity of the pbmc fractions.

cathepsin activities can be measured using crude lysate at acidic ph
purifying endolysosomes from crude lysate is a laborious process and the yield is much lesser. we aimed to develop a simple approach to test the activity of endolysosomal proteins to be used in assays with limited amount of material using crude pbmc lysate. we also made sure that cystatins do not affect cathepsin activity in low ph extracts. cystatins are cysteine protease inhibitors present in the cytosol and reversibly bind and inhibit the activity of cathepsin  <cit> . we compared the activity of cysteine cathepsins between live cells and low ph crude lysate derived from the same number of cells. we observed similar levels of enzyme activity in extracts and live cells, showing no effect of cystatins in the measurement of cathepsins in low ph extracts . additionally previous studies showed that cystatins are susceptible to protein degradation at low ph  <cit> . since the assays we use hereafter are designed to assess cathepsin activity in lower ph, the effect of cystatin activity should be negligible. we first tested the activity of cathepsin b, k, d, and s present in the endolysosomes at several ph ranging from two to nine, since endolysosomal proteases are activated in acidic ph  <cit> . crude pbmc extracts were resuspended in a buffer that was adjusted to the appropriate ph. we then added fluorogenic substrates that were specific for cathepsins s, d, k and b  and also an omni-cathepsin substrate  specific for all cysteine cathepsins  <cit> . the fluorescence was monitored for three to four hours after addition of crude lysate and substrate. as a negative control, only pbs was added in the place of crude lysate. we then calculated the maximum slope of the fluorescence curve for each cathepsin at all ph after background correction . the experiment was repeated with pbmc from three different healthy donors. omni-cathepsin substrate was cleaved best at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , suggesting that cysteine cathepsin activity is higher at acidic ph. cathepsin s, which has been implicated in antigen processing showed high activity at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . cathepsin b displayed higher activity at ph  <dig>  whereas cathepsin d and k showed higher activity at cytosolic ph  <dig> . several studies attribute endolysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin s to the production of class i and ii epitopes  <cit> , which exhibited ten-fold higher activity in acidic ph  <dig>  when compared to cytosolic ph  <dig> . however cathepsin d and cathepsin k exhibited eight to ten-fold higher activity in physiological ph  <dig> . recent studies showed that in some cases, cathepsin k is active at normal ph because it is secreted by the cells and play a role in bone resorption  <cit>  and this may explain increased activity of cathepsin k in cytosolic ph. in summary, pbmc cathepsins specifically involved in protein processing are more active at acidic ph. we also monitored the specificity of each substrate for the enzyme by adding cathepsin inhibitors to the mix and found that cathepsin b substrate can be cleaved by cathepsin s and cathepsin s substrate can be cleaved by cathepsin b . despite this cross-reactivity, the overall activity of cathepsin s and cathepsin b covered different ph ranges . in addition we used a peptide degradation assay to monitor cathepsin activity at different ph without the use of fluorescent substrates.

pbmc cathepsins involved in protein processing degrade peptides at acidic ph
to demonstrate a functional consequence of the activation of endolyosomal enzymes at acidic ph we used a peptide degradation assay developed in our laboratory  <cit>  to determine if the cathepsins activated at different ph would degrade peptides differently. these degradation assays were performed in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors to identify specific cathepsins that played a role in antigen processing. b27kk <dig> was degraded with crude pbmc lysate in a reaction buffer that ranged from ph  <dig>  to  <dig> . the products of peptide degradation after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes of the reaction were analyzed by rp-hplc and the percentage of remaining original peptide was quantified from the area under peak . to rule out any effect of acidic ph on the peptides, the peptide was incubated for the same amount of time with the reaction buffer without any crude lysate and the peptide was quantified by rp-hplc . as mentioned in figure 1d, a half-life of the peptide in the presence or absence of cathepsin can be calculated. however, the half-life was not always apparent because of slower degradation kinetics. therefore, on fitting a one-phase exponential decay curve, we calculated the stability rate of the peptide at each ph . we previously showed that stability rate correlates with the half-life of a peptide and can be calculated in cases where half-life of the peptide cannot be calculated from the degradation curve  <cit> . the stability rate of the peptide without inhibitor was assigned a value of one and the fold change in the stability rate in the presence of inhibitors was calculated. in the presence of cathepsin s and cathepsin d inhibitors, the stability rate of the peptide increased  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating that the cleavage of the b27kk <dig> peptide required proteases that were activated only in acidic conditions. our previous results also showed that cytosolic protease activities are completely eliminated at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> , therefore indicating that peptide degradation at acidic ph is performed exclusively by endolysosomal proteases. no change in stability rate was noted in extremely acidic ph  <dig>  and neutral ph  <dig>  and basic ph  <dig> . the experiment was repeated using pbmc lysate from three different healthy donors and the average of three results are shown in figure 3c. in summary, using an alternative approach involving peptide degradation followed by hplc quantification rather than using fluorogenic enzyme substrates we showed that endolysosomal proteases involved in antigen processing cleave peptides only in acidic ph, and that crude extracts at lower ph can be used to monitor peptide degradation by these cathepsins.

endolysosomes and crude lysate at acidic ph degrade peptides with the same kinetics and produce similar fragments
we then sought to determine if the kinetics of protein degradation and the subsequent peptide fragments produced after degradation were similar when using purified endolysosomes or crude pbmc lysate as a source of enzymes for protein processing. we performed a degradation assay as mentioned in figure  <dig> and analyzed the peptide fragments produced by mass spectrometry. we compared the degradation of a longer hiv peptide relevant to antigen processing and peptide-based immunogens with crude lysate and purified endolysosomes at ph  <dig>   and  <dig>    <cit> . based on results in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we hypothesized that specific sets of cathepsins will be activated at ph  <dig>  versus ph  <dig>  which would give rise to different peptide fragments between the two conditions. we analyzed the degradation products of a longer peptide, 5-kf11- <dig> , a  <dig> amino acid long fragment from p <dig> protein in hiv- <dig> clade b encompassing epitope b57kf <dig> figure . the products of the degradation after a 60-minute incubation with either crude lysate or purified endolysosomes at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  were identified by mass spectrometry. at ph  <dig> , a total of  <dig> peptides were identified in endolysosome-mediated degradation and  <dig> peptides in the crude lysate-mediated fraction. of these,  <dig> peptides or  <dig> % of the fragments present in the crude lysate degradation fraction were similar those produced in endolysosomes . unique peptides produced under each condition can be attributed to possible minor contribution cytosolic proteases that retain some hydrolytic activity in low ph. at ph  <dig>  we found that  <dig> % of the peptides present in crude lysate mediated degradation fraction were similar to the endolysosomal fraction. interestingly, common peptide fragments detected in crude lysate and endolysosomal degradation conditions contributed to 99% of overall peptide intensity showing that unique fragments detected were present only in negligible quantities . the peptide fragments produced in both degradation conditions at each ph ranged from 4– <dig> amino acid residues in length with several fragments harboring the mhc class i epitope b57kf <dig>  fragments produced at ph  <dig>  in crude lysate and endolysosomes were mostly longer with 70% of the fragments between 13– <dig> amino acids in length and fragments produced at ph  <dig>  were shorter, suggesting a stepwise degradation of longer fragments into shorter peptides over the course of endolysosomal maturation . also, on average 40% of the peptides produced in ph  <dig>  in endolysosomes and crude lysate and 30% of the peptides in ph  <dig>  contained extensions of the epitope b57kf <dig>  showing that similar levels of peptide degradation were present in both conditions . we repeated the degradation using lysate from a different pbmc donor and the peptide 5-isw9- <dig> , a  <dig> amino acid long peptide from the hiv p <dig> protein encompassing epitope b57isw <dig> . we compared by mass spectrometry the identity and corresponding peak sirface intensities of all peptides produced in purified endolysosomes and in crude lysate at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  . more than 95% of the peptide intensities were contributed by fragments that were similar between pbmc crude lysate and endolysosomes . comparable levels of peptides encompassed the epitope b57isw <dig> and peptide length distributions were observed between crude lysate and endolysosomes . however, in contrast to 5-kf11- <dig> the peptides generated at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  were similar for 5-isw9- <dig>  suggesting that the peptides were generated by cathepsins active at ph  <dig> and  <dig> . the differences in the degradation patterns of 5-kf11- <dig> and 5-isw9- <dig> showed that peptide fragments generated by cathepsin-mediated degradation is dependent on the nature of the oligopeptide and its susceptibility to cleavage by cathepsins present in different compartments. we also determined the half-life of b57kf <dig> peptide in crude extracts at low ph versus endolysosomes and found them to be similar  . these results in summary show that crude lysate at ph  <dig>  to ph  <dig>  can be used to assess cathepsin-mediated degradation of peptides and proteins in the place of purified endolysosomes.

discussion
endolysosomes contain proteins that are involved in diverse functions in the cell  <cit> . loss of activity in several of these proteins leads to disease  <cit> . current approaches to study endolysosomal proteins are not sufficient to comprehensively understand the role of the organelle in cellular functions and using purified organelles is not feasible in studies involving access to limited amount of material such as primary cells and tissues. because several endolysosomal proteases are activated in acidic ph  <cit> , we have utilized this characteristic to develop a simple approach to study the role of these proteases in peptide degradation using crude pbmc lysate.

most studies involving endolysosomal protease activity use recombinant purified cathepsins  <cit> , manipulations such as gene knockouts in in vitro cell cultures  <cit>  or purified endolysosomes from cells or tissues  <cit> . in some cases, the results obtained are not the most physiologically relevant and require further validation in primary human tissues. using the methodology described here, it is possible to assess the activity of one or simultaneously, many endolysosomal enzymes using crude lysate prepared from primary cells. also, by modulating the ph, specific enzymes can be activated and cross-reactivity from other cytosolic proteins can be avoided while allowing to follow protein degradation in endolysosomal compartments. by using appropriate substrates for each enzyme a novel diagnostic for lysosomal protein disorders may be envisioned.

another area of research that will benefit greatly from this assay is antigen presentation. antigen presentation takes place in two different pathways inside the cell; the endogenous cytosolic pathway predominantly involved in class i presentation and the exogenous endolysosomal pathway involved in class ii and class i epitope cross-presentation  <cit> . one of the questions that has yet to be addressed in antigen presentation is the characteristics that govern efficient presentation of epitopes from a pathogen-derived protein endocytosed in cells. to date, the precise nature by which long pathogen-derived proteins are degraded in endocytic compartments to produce epitope length fragments is poorly defined. despite the critical role of protein degradation in endolysosomes to elicit immune responses the nature of peptides cross-presented by mhc-i and mhc-ii is not well defined in part due to the lack of adequate assays. class ii epitopes are not as well characterized as class i epitopes because of the limited knowledge of anchor residues within the mhc class ii protein and looser binding of peptides onto mhc-ii. using our assay, it will be possible to study the degradation of pathogen-derived proteins or vaccine immunogens in crude extracts at neutral vs. acidic ph and identify epitopes produced in cytosol and endolysosomal compartments by mass spectrometry. using these peptide fragments in in vivo antigen presentation assays and assaying for cd <dig> or cd <dig> t cell stimulation will further help to define class i and class ii epitopes that are produced after intracellular processing and cross-presentation.

vaccine immunogens  mostly enter dendritic cells through endolysosomes for degradation followed by presentation of peptides by mhc-i and mhc-ii leading to the priming of cd <dig> t cell responses and cd <dig> t helper cell responses  <cit> . knowledge of epitopes that are well defined and preserved within cellular compartments will enable efficient vaccine design. this is especially important in light of chimeric vaccine immunogens , so as to include peptides that will be efficiently processed and presented on the cell surface  <cit> . with increased interest in targeted vaccines, wherein, antigens can be engineered to target specific compartments, once again, knowledge of stable epitopes that are produced efficiently in each of the targeted compartments is of immense importance. the methodology described here will facilitate these studies and bypass the need of intensive labor, access to large amounts of primary human cells and complicated techniques.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that using crude pbmc cellular extracts at low ph, endolysosomal protease activity can be measured in a simple and efficient manner, results of which can be used in several applications. we demonstrated that by varying the ph in crude cellular extracts, we could specifically activate certain cathepsins at each ph and thereby monitor protease activity over the course of endolysosomal maturation. we demonstrated the usefulness of this assay in the context of antigen processing and showed comparable results to using purified endolysosomes.
