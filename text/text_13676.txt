BACKGROUND
for many ocular diseases that result in the loss of vision, the death of retinal ganglion cells  is the final common pathway. glaucoma is one such ocular disease where the sporadic family history and the presence of significant risk factors in select populations suggest that the susceptibility of rgc death is a complex trait  <cit> . for example, elevation in intraocular pressure  in open angle glaucoma is strongly associated with an increased likelihood of rgc death. lowering iop almost always has the beneficial effect of sparing rgcs. however, some patients with normal or even low iop develop glaucoma with associated rgc death  <cit> . the reverse is also true: selected populations of people have very high iops and yet do not develop glaucoma or lose rgcs  <cit> . the fact that some patients with low iops develop glaucoma while others with high iops do not has led to the hypothesis that critical genetic sequence variants segregating human populations influence the relative susceptibility or resistance to ganglion cell death  <cit> . one efficient way to measure the influence of sequence variants on complex traits is to compare different inbred strains of mice. for example, nickells and colleagues  <cit>  studied the differential survival of rgcs in  <dig> highly diverse strains of mice following optic nerve crush, finding that ganglion cells in some strains were highly susceptible whereas other strains were relatively resistant. this difference demonstrates the importance of genetic background on the complex process of ganglion cell death. defining the genomic differences between these strains has the potential to lead to novel treatments to prevent ganglion cell loss and preserve vision.

one obvious approach to examining the molecular differences that underlie the susceptibility or resistance of ganglion cells to injury is to use microarray methods to profile the transcriptomes of inbred strains of mice. a considerable amount of published microarray data describes the retina's response to injury in different rodent strains. when one looks across all of these studies, there is a general agreement that changes in gene expression are classic responses of the central nervous system  to injury  <cit> . for example, genes that are associated with reactive gliosis, such as gfap, are often upregulated, whereas neuronal marker genes such as thy <dig> are often downregulated  <cit> . some studies have gone further, focusing on the response of the inner retina to look at regional changes  <cit> ; other studies have used laser-capture microdissection to examine expression profiles of isolated rgcs  <cit> . the common responses to injury can be observed in a variety of different types of insult to the eye. earlier work in our laboratory  <cit>  found that many of the changes resulting from mechanical injury to the eye are similar to changes in other models of retinal injury, including ischemia  <cit> , elevated intraocular pressure  <cit> , photocoagulation  <cit> , and photo-oxidative stress  <cit> . these common responses across different rodent species with different types of insult are interesting, however since they are common to susceptible and resistant strains they are of little use in determining the underling susceptibility to insult.

in this study, we compared the response of the retina to optic nerve crush in c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice. both of these strains are widely used in vision research. there is an extensive catalogue of ocular phenotypes and genetic modifications for both strains  <cit> . also, these two strains are the parents of the bxd recombinant inbred  strain set, which has been used for more than a decade to study the genetic basis of variations in the structure of the eye, retina, and central visual system  <cit> . we have comprehensive gene expression data for the eyes of most of these bxd strains  <cit>  and therefore can use all of these array and phenotype datasets to map sequence variants that influence entire genetic networks regulating the response of the retina to injury.

RESULTS
to study molecular mechanisms underlying differential response of the retina to injury, we exploited two mouse strains, c57bl/6j and the dba/2j. the first part of this section covers the differential effect of optic nerve crush on ganglion cell survival. for the anatomical studies the retinas were examined  <dig> days after the optic nerve crush. this extended period of time allowed us to have a clear picture of the long-term effects of the insult to the optic nerve. in the second part, we describe changes in the transcriptome at two time points after the crush. to define potential changes in the transcriptome that underlie the long-term effects of optic nerve crush, the microarray samples were taken at  <dig> and  <dig> days after optic nerve crush. we have supplemented the analysis by generating microarray data of cultured astrocytes from c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains and by a meta-analysis of array data from existing public databases.

retinal ganglion cell loss after optic nerve crush
to define difference in the response of the c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice to optic nerve crush, we examined the retinas of normal mice and mice  <dig> days after optic nerve crush . the most obvious change was a dramatic decrease in the number of neun-stained cells in the retinas of both strains when the nerve was crushed. we counted the number of neun-labeled cells in the ganglion cell layers of control retinas and retinas from animals  <dig> days after optic nerve crush for both the c57bl/6j mouse and the dba/2j mouse. we sampled between  <dig> and  <dig> fields from  <dig> retinas for each strain to define the density of neun positive cells per mm <dig> . in the control c57bl/6j mice, the average number of neun-positive cells  was  <dig> cells/mm <dig> with a standard error of  <dig> cells/mm <dig>  the control dba/2j mice had  <dig> cells/mm <dig> with a standard error of  <dig> cells/mm <dig>  this difference in the density of neun-positive cells between the two strains is significant using the student t-test .

in our data, we see a significant difference in the number of neun-positive cells between the c57bl/6j and the dba/2j strains. when one examines the literature for comparative numbers, williams et al.  <cit>  calculated the axon number to be a mean of  <dig>  ganglion cells per retina for the c57bl/6j strain  and  <dig>  ganglion cells per retina for the dba/2j strain. if this is converted to cell density per mm <dig> the numbers are  <dig>  cells/mm <dig> for the c57bl/6j strain and  <dig>  cells/mm <dig> for the dba/2j strain. in the study by buckingham et al.  <cit>  they used neun staining and cell counting similar to that used in the present study and they arrived at very similar numbers . extrapolating from their graph they see  <dig>  cells per mm <dig> for c57bl/6j and  <dig>  cells per mm <dig> for the dba/2j mouse  <cit> . these numbers are very similar to the ones from the present study. it is hard to say why there are differences between studies. the most parsimonious explanation is that differences seen from study to study may be related to the sampling method.

after the optic nerve crush, the average density of neun-positive cells decreased to  <dig> cells/mm <dig> in c57bl/6j retina and to  <dig> cells/mm <dig> in dba/2j retina. to determine if there is a difference in the response of the retinal ganglion cells to injury, we calculated the percent survival for each optic nerve crushed retina, dividing the density of retinal ganglion cells in that retina by the average density in the control retina of the same strain. the disparity in survival between the two strains is shown in figure  <dig>  there was a 54% survival of neun-positive cells in the c57bl/6j mouse, while the dba/2j mice had a 62% survival of neurons. this difference in neun-labeled cell loss is significant using a student t-test . since we used neun to label cells in the ganglion cell layer, it is possible that displaced amacrine cells were included in our counts. the displaced amacrine cells represent a diverse population of cells  <cit> . there are strain differences in the number of amacrine cells in the mouse  <cit> . the strain differences include the number of chat-positive displaced amacrine cells  <cit> . in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse the chat-positive amacrine cells are estimated to be 19% of the total population of displaced amacrine cells  <cit> . thus, the neurons surviving in the ganglion cell layer may include both ganglion cells and some displaced amacrine cells. it is worth noting that buckingham et al.  <cit>  directly addressed this question and found that a consistent proportion of chat-positive displaced amacrine cells expressed detectible levels of neun.

when we compare our data to others, we find that li et al.  <cit>  did not observe a statistically significant difference in survival following optic nerve crush between the c57bl/6j mouse and the dba/2j mouse. it is interesting to note that the dba/2j trended higher than the c57bl/6j   <cit> . in our study, we found a modest, but statistically significant differences between the two strains. this could be due to differences in techniques to crush the optic nerve, differences in staining, or the fact that we used control mice and li et al.  <cit>  used the contralateral eye as a control for optic nerve crush  <cit> . the small difference in survival we observe may have significant ramifications to our microarray studies and will allow us to map genetic networks using the bxd recombinant inbred mice along with the powerful bioinformatics tools in genenetwork  <cit> .

changes in the transcriptome after optic nerve crush in the c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains
microarrays were run on both the c57bl/6j and the dba/2j strains with rna isolated from control mice and mice  <dig> and  <dig> days after optic nerve crush. the first step in the data analysis was to select a set of genes for analysis. for this analysis we used significance analysis of microarrays . we made five biologically meaningful comparisons to define groups of genes that change in the two strains following optic nerve crush. the first comparison was to define genes that had significantly different levels of expression between the two normal retinas, control c57bl/6j retina and control dba/2j retina . the next four comparisons were done to select genes that were differentially expressed after optic nerve crush, comparing the control samples to the 2-day crush and 5-day crush samples of each strain for both the c57bl/6j retina and dba/2j retina. this will define genes that are changing following optic nerve crush: c57bl/6j control versus  <dig> day after injury  and versus  <dig> days after injury  and dba/2j control versus  <dig> days after injury  and  <dig> days after injury . after the duplicate probes were scrubbed, a total of  <dig>  probes from the illumina array were selected with a false discovery rate less than  <dig> . the next phase of the analysis was to define functional clusters of genes using a principal component analysis. using the clusfavor v <dig>  program  <cit> , we identified clusters of genes based on their expression patterns . this analysis resulted in  <dig> eigenvectors dividing the dataset into  <dig> groups, with a positive and negative component for each vector . the  <dig> clusters account for all of the variability in the dataset. a number of different data-mining tools were used to extract biologically meaningful information from these clusters. the web-based software used included the national center for biotechnology information web site for pubmed  <cit>  and entrez gene databases  <cit> , chilibot for searching pubmed relationships  <cit> , genomatix for searching for possible transcription factors  <cit> , transfac  <dig>  for transcription factor mining  <cit> , ucsc genome bioinformatics for its genome browser  <cit> , webgestalt for its annotation abilities  <cit> , gensat  <cit> , and genenetwork  <cit> .

to complement this work, we generated a microarray dataset for astrocytes isolated from the c57bl/6j and the dba/2j cortices. this astrocyte data set was used to generate three lists of transcripts. we used two independent approaches to create the lists. the first approach compared the average expression of all of transcripts in the  <dig>  astrocyte micorarrays to the average of the gene expression in the  <dig> normal retina samples . the first list is a group of  <dig> genes, which were 20-fold enriched in the astrocyte sample relative to the retina. we considered this list of genes to be an astrocyte signature. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were present in the selected genes of the optic nerve crush dataset . the second list of genes, totaling  <dig>  contained transcripts that were 20-fold enriched in the retina relative to the astrocyte sample, was classified as a non-astrocyte signature. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were present in the optic nerve crush dataset . the third list of genes, totaling  <dig>  was created to identify transcripts that were differentially expressed in cultured c57bl/6j astrocytes relative to dba/2j astrocytes. in this list,  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in c57bl/6j astrocytes and  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in dba/2j astrocytes. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were present in the optic nerve crush dataset . the first two of these three lists were combined and considered to be differentially expressed genes between the two types of astrocytes. these lists of genes were used in our analysis of the differential response of the c57bl/6j and dba/2j retina to optic nerve crush.

of the  <dig>  genes in our optic nerve crush data set,  <dig> were selected and examined by real-time qrt-pcr. these genes were bcl2a1a, chrna <dig>  cryaa, crybb <dig>  crym, egr <dig>  gfap, sox <dig>  and thy <dig>  . in general, the patterns of change for the genes monitored by real-time qrt-pcr were similar to those observed in the averaged microarray datasets. the levels of gfap were similar in comparison between the control data versus 2-day injury data, as well as the comparison between the 2-day versus 5-day injury data. other genes, such as bcl2a1a, chrna <dig>  cryaa, crybb <dig>  crym, and thy <dig>  were similar in the overall trend from control to 5-day. however, the 2-day versus 5-day fold change was not always in the same direction, although the differences were small. in other cases, there were slight differences in the fold changes, as with the egr <dig> gene, for which the real-time qrt-pcr indicated a + <dig> -fold change between the c57bl/6j 2-day versus 5-day, the microarray result was - <dig>  for the same condition. egr <dig> had a - <dig> -fold change in the dba/2j between the 2-day versus 5-day, but the microarray data yielded + <dig> . nonetheless, the agreement between the microarray data and real-time qrt-pcr data was excellent; indicating that for the genes tested, the microarray provided an appropriate measure of transcript level. once the quality of the dataset was proven, we clustered the data into groups and began our functional analysis.

most genes are found in the first principal component , which contains  <dig> genes or 44% of the total variance in the dataset. the genes in pc <dig> change similarly in response to optic nerve crush in both c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression level for genes in pc <dig> is approximately equal in control c57bl/6j mice as compared to the dba/2j mice. for pc <dig> positive, the genes are downregulated 2-days after optic nerve crush and even further downregulated 5-days after nerve crush. a brief scan of this list of genes ) reveals that many genes, such as thy <dig> and chrna <dig>  are genes associated with ganglion cell injury and death. to provide an alternative method of determining the cell types represented in pc <dig> positive, we examined the labeling patterns of the gensat project web site  <cit> . gensat describes a series of mouse strains that label sets of cells within the mouse brain that express trans-genes under labels of gene-specific promoter constructs. of the  <dig> genes in pc <dig> positive,  <dig> were found in gensat, with  <dig> genes labeling neurons in the brain and  <dig>  specifically labeling axons in the optic tract. these data indicate that pc <dig> positive represents genes that are involved in the generalized decrease in neuronal markers, specifically ganglion cells, in response to optic nerve crush.

pc <dig> negative is also composed of genes with approximately equal expression in control c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice. however, both sets of genes are upregulated 2-days after optic nerve crush and upregulated even further at 5-days after crush . genes in this group are associated not only with reactive gliosis, but with neuronal genes in an attempt at abortive regeneration ). glial fibrillary acidic protein , the hallmark for reactive gliosis, is found in this group. many of the genes in this list are also markers for astrocytes. these include gfap, the penultimate astrocytic cytoskeletal marker, and sox <dig> a known astrocyte transcription factor.

to further evaluate astrocytes marker genes, we examined our data from cultured astrocytes from c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice. in one analysis, we identified genes that were enriched in astrocytes as compared to the normal retina. of the  <dig> astrocyte signature genes in our dataset of  <dig>  probes,  <dig> are present within pc <dig> negative, indicating that pc <dig> negative contains an astrocyte signature. we also observed genes involved in abortive regeneration, among them growing axon protein  <dig> . in examining the labeling patterns on gensat,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in pc <dig> negative were found. four of the pc <dig> negative genes  labeled glial cells and two of the genes  labeled axons in the optic nerve. the changes observed in pc <dig> are common to cns injury and are associated with the experimental condition of axonal injury caused by optic nerve crush. this represents the most variance in the microarray dataset and, as expected, it is due to the experimental condition. when these results are compared to other microarray studies that examined the effects of injury in the retina, there is a surprisingly similar list of genes. these are injury response elements, many of which are found in the retina after a variety of insults: ischemia  <cit> , elevated iop  <cit> , photocoagulation  <cit> , photo-oxidative stress  <cit> , or direct retinal injury  <cit> .

a recent publication  <cit>  demonstrated the importance of the mtor pathway, not only in regulating axonal regeneration in the optic nerve, but also the survival of retinal ganglion cells. a functional knockout of pten, the negative regulator of mtor, promoted axon regeneration and the survival of rgcs after optic nerve injury  <cit> . in our dataset, we observed various changes in  <dig> genes within the pten/mtor pathways. furthermore, pten itself is significantly upregulated and is in pc <dig> negative. these findings clearly show that some of the molecular changes associated with the abortive regenerative response of the pten/mtor pathways are associated with the changes we observed in our study. the presence of  <dig> of these genes in pc <dig> positive indicates that they have a generalized function in the abortive response of rgcs. future studies will focus on the importance of this pathway following injury to the optic nerve.

the next principal component  appears to group genes having different levels of expression in the two strains of mice. pc <dig> contains  <dig> genes, which represents 23% of the variance in the dataset ). the most obvious difference is the level of gene expression between the c57bl/6j control group and the dba/2j control group . in pc <dig> positive , the expression level in c57bl/6j mice is low, while the dba/2j mice have high levels of expression. furthermore, the pattern of expression after optic nerve crush in the dba/2j mouse is virtually a mirror image of the c57bl/6j, with expression decreasing 2-days after crush in the dba/2j mice and increasing at 2-days after crush in the c57bl/6j mice. the pc <dig> negative  is almost the reverse of the pc <dig> positive component, with the expression level in c57bl/6j mice being high and the expression level in dba/2j mice being low. to investigate further, we rank-ordered the fold change between the c57bl/6j and dba/2j control retinas. among the genes in pc <dig> in this ranked list,  <dig>  of the  <dig> probes were in the top 5% of the most variable genes in the dataset. the most parsimonious explanation is that the genes in pc <dig> are differentially expressed in the c57bl/j and dba/2j retinas and are not differentially affected by optic nerve crush.

to test the hypothesis that pc <dig> represents genes that differ between the two strains, we examined the hamilton eye institute mouse eye database  on genenetwork  <cit>  to determine whether any of the genes in pc <dig> had a significant quantitative trait locus  or were part of a gene network within the eye. most of the genes had strong cis-qtls and were not part of an overall genetic network. the large cis-qtl found in genenetwork also points to the fact that these are genes with differences in expression in c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice, the parental strains of the bxd ri strain set. the gene network analysis and expression patterns led us to the same conclusion.

this being the case, one would predict that these differences are present in different tissues from these two strains. thus, we examined the microarray databases generated from c57bl/6j and dba/2j cultured astrocytes. a surprising number of genes are differentially expressed between the c57bl/6j and dba/2j astrocytes and are also present in pc <dig>  of the  <dig> differentially expressed astrocyte genes found among the  <dig>  genes of the optic nerve crush dataset,  <dig> were in pc <dig>  this indicates that the differential expression between the two strains is also in astrocytes as well as the retina. furthermore, genes that are more highly expressed in dba/2j astrocytes are highly expressed in the dba/2j retina, while genes that are expressed at higher levels in c57bl/6j astrocytes are highly expressed in the c57bl/6j retina.

if pc <dig> represents genes that are differentially expressed, one would predict that these genes would be expressed in a variety of different cell types which is in fact, the case. the genes in pc <dig> are found in all cell types within the cns. a total of  <dig> genes were found in the gensat database. in pc <dig> positive,  <dig> genes  were expressed in optic nerve axons and neurons. in pc <dig> negative, one gene  was observed labeling axons in the optic nerve. in addition, neurons were labeled in the brain by  <dig> additional genes, including mtap1b, lypd <dig>  cdon, d430039no5rik, dap <dig>  dcnq <dig>  rgs <dig>  tac <dig>  and tph <dig>  both pc <dig> negative and positive contained glial genes;  <dig>  were in pc <dig> positive and  <dig>  were in pc <dig> negative. thus, pc <dig> appears to represent genes that are differentially expressed in the c57bl/6j and dba/2j retinas. these genes do not appear to be related to any specific cell type or function.

the most intriguing functional components are within pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig>  ). these components represent interactions between the effects of optic nerve crush injury and the genetic background of the two mouse strains. if there is a signature for susceptibility or resistance to ganglion cell death, or if there is a signature of reactive gliosis, then it lies within these components. accordingly, we used all of the bioinformatics tools at our disposal to identify a meaningful association between the genes within each component. first, to determine if there was a molecular signature of a specific cell type within any of the pcs, we searched cell-type-specific profiles in cahoy et al.  <cit> , who provided databases of genes enriched in astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. we were not able to identify a signature for a specific cell type in our microarray datasets. we also used online databases nei bank  <cit> , webgestalt  <cit> , genenetwork  <cit> , and gene ontology  <cit>  but were unable to identify clear functional associations of the genes within most of the pc <dig> to pc <dig> clusters. in two clusters, pc <dig> negative and pc <dig> negative, we were able to impart functional associations between the genes.

our laboratory is one of the first to use the bioinformatics tools on genenetwork to explore the functional relationships between genes clustered in a microarray experiment  <cit> . the basic hypothesis is that common regulatory elements modulate genes to create similar changes, thereby driving them into the same pc. a similar approach was taken with the data in the current study. we loaded all of the data from the individual pcs into genenetwork and examined it to determine whether genomic loci could be identified that modulated the expression of a significant number of genes within a given pc. we used two databases, the bxd eye database  and the bxd striatum database , which was run with the same illumina chip used in the present study.

only pc <dig> negative was found to have a series of genomic loci modulating the expression of the genes and this was observed only in the striatum database. of the  <dig> genes in pc <dig> negative,  <dig> were found to have common regulatory genomic loci . the genes and loci shown in figure  <dig> may represent a genetic network that is activated by optic nerve crush. the bands seen in the qtl-heat map represent the likelihood ratio statistic  and provide a measure of the linkage between variation in the phenotype and genetic differences at a particular genetic locus  <cit> . as the color progresses from yellow to red or from green to blue, the lrs score increases. some genes in pc <dig> negative  have a lrs to chr  <dig> . individually, the remaining genes do not have significant lrs scores; collectively, however, they form a pattern that reveals a modulatory genomic network . this banding pattern  is a signature of loci modulating most of the genes in pc <dig> negative.

with genenetwork, we are able to examine the trans-bands in the pc <dig> negative qtl map to define candidate genes that may be upstream modulators of the network. we selected two bands for this analysis, chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig>  using the advance search program on genenetwork, the loci were mined to identify genes within them that have significant qtls . six candidate genes  with cis-qtls in chr  <dig> 50- <dig> mb were found. one candidate gene, bat1a,  was identified for the band on chr.  <dig> 27- <dig> mb. on examination, bat1a was found to be one of the genes within the pc <dig> negative gene cluster . thus, it appears that pc <dig> negative forms a functional gene network with a yet unknown function. to find the function of the pc <dig> negative gene network, we ran the list of genes on webgestalt and gene ontology. webgestalt showed that  <dig> genes were involved in cellular metabolism, with  <dig> of the  <dig>  involved in nucleic acid metabolism and  <dig> of the  <dig>  involved in cellular macromolecule metabolism. the gene ontology for the group found that  <dig> genes  had a biological process in the ubiquitin cycle and  <dig> other genes  had a cellular function relating to an intracellular membrane-bound organelle. based on the biological function, the genes clustered in pc <dig> negative appear to be related to cellular remodeling.

one intriguing finding was the presence of crystallin genes in pc <dig> negative. crystallin family members in c57bl/6j mice respond to optic nerve crush differently than do those in dba/2j mice . this observation led us to reanalyze the entire crystallin family. we found that many of the crystallin family members have a similar pattern of expression, being downregulated in the c57bl/6j retina and upregulated in the dba/2j retina at 2-days after optic nerve crush. the members of the crystallin family with this pattern of expression include cryaa, cryab, cryba <dig>  cryba <dig>  cryba <dig>  crybb <dig>  crybb <dig>  crybb <dig>  crygb, crygc, crygd, and crygs . thus, it appears that a selective group of crystallins is differentially affected by optic nerve crush in the two strains of mice. if we examine the hei retina database for the genes that are differentially modulated by optic nerve crush , it is very clear that the expression of this group of crystallins is highly correlated across the strains in the bxd ri strain set . this is a strong indicator that this subset of crystallin genes form a genetic network within the normal retina and the differences we observed in the parental strains  are the basis for the network observed in the bxd retinas. one could argue that this is due to lens contamination or an oddity of the retina; however, this is not the case. if we examine the bxd hippocampus dataset in genenetwork, then we can see a similar highly correlated network . this would exclude the possibility of contamination by the lens, for it is not present within the brain. furthermore, the crystallin network does not appear to be specific to the bxd ri strain set. a similar crystallin network is also observed in the lxs ri hippocampus . thus, the crystallin network is found in the hippocampus of two different ri strain sets, the bxd and the lxs. the crystallin network is not an artifact of the microarray platform being used. in the bxd retina dataset we used the illumina sentrix mouse  <dig> version  <dig>  array, in the bxd hippocampus dataset we used the affymetrix mouse expression  <dig> v <dig>  array, and in the lxs hippocampus we used the illumina sentrix mouse  <dig> version  <dig>  array. this indicates that crystallin network is found using very different microarray platforms and is not due to an inherent complication that is platform specific. finally, this crystallin network is not generalized to all cns structures. if we examine the bxd cerebellum dataset or the bxd striatum dataset in genenetwork, there is no correlation between these crystallin family members.

the table contains the crystallin genes, which showed the expression pattern due to injury seen in figure  <dig>  the values represent the correlation values in our hei retina database for the bxd ri strain set. the correlation values are also shown for hippocampus tissues in the bxd ri strain set as well as the lxs mouse cross. this demonstrates that the crystallin gene correlation is not limited to the retina or the bxd. correlation values are related to the probe or probe set for crygs.

is this difference in crystallin response unique to these mice or is it found in other species? examining the literature, we found that the response of crystallins in the retina varies from strain to strain in both mouse and rat. for example, in wistar  <cit>  and brown norway rats  <cit> , crystallin expression goes down after elevated iop. in sprague-dawley rats, crystallins are upregulated after either a retinal tear  <cit>  or after light damage  <cit> . a similar story is found for the mouse. in the naturally occurring glaucoma of the dba/2j mouse, steele et al.  <cit>  found that crystallins are downregulated. in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse, crystallins are upregulated after laser burns in the retina  <cit> . taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate different responses of the crystallin family depending on the strain of rodent as well as different types of insult.

initially one thinks of crystallins as lens proteins; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that members of this family have biological roles outside the lens  <cit> . several studies of the retina have demonstrated a group of crystallins that are altered by light-induced injury  <cit> , elevated iop  <cit> , or retinal detachment  <cit> . changes in crystallin expression is also found after injury in other regions of the cns, including the spinal cord  <cit>  and cerebral cortex  <cit> . selected crystallins also have a function in the response to injury in non-neuronal tissues such as heart muscle  <cit>  and kidney  <cit> . thus, the crystallins can no longer be thought of as merely lens proteins, but must be considered as having a larger biological role.

what function do crystallins have in the retina and other tissues? the α-crystallins possess chaperone activity and share properties with heat-shock proteins  <cit> . the β-crystallins and γ-crystallins also respond to stress in tissues other than the lens and have an ap- <dig> binding site in their promoter regions  <cit> . most functional studies of crystallins point to an intrinsic action of the proteins affecting intracellular molecular processes. specifically, α-crystallins appear to have anti-apoptotic activity  <cit> . recently, fischer et al.  <cit>  suggested that purified crystallins added to the vitreous chamber or cultured explants of retina promote axonal growth and induce reactive gliosis. in the present study, we observed differential regulation of crystallin family members following optic nerve crush in c57bl/ <dig> and dba/2j mice. it is tempting to speculate that this differential expression of crystallins may account, in part, for the differential survival of retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve crush. this hypothesis is supported in part by recent studies demonstrating that crystallin family members protect retinal ganglion cells from the effects of optic nerve crush  <cit> .

inbred mouse strains are powerful tools in defining the genetic basis for selective susceptibility to neuronal death. by examining differences in the susceptibility of individual mouse strains, it is possible to identify the contribution of genetic background to differential neuronal death. the genetic backgrounds of inbred strains influence the response of the retina and cns to disease and injury. a prime example of this approach is a paper from the nickells group  <cit> . the authors examined neuronal survival following optic nerve crush in  <dig> strains of mice, finding that a substantial difference in neuronal survival depended on the mouse strain studied. the most resistant strain was the dba/2j mouse; the most susceptible was the balb/cbyj mouse. the strain hierarchy of the effect of nerve crush does not translate to other types of cns neurons. in the spinal cord, neurons in the balb/c are highly susceptible to contusion injury  <cit> , whereas neurons of the substantia nigra in the balb/c strain are relatively resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine , as well as experimental autoimmune encephalitis   <cit> . in the c57bl/6j mouse strain, retinal ganglion cells are comparatively resistant to optic nerve crush but are susceptible to mptp exposure and eae. interestingly, the c57bl/6j and balb/c strains are approximately equal in their susceptibility to spinal cord injury  <cit> . schauwecker and steward  <cit>  determined that the c57bl/6j and balb/c strains are invulnerable to glutamate-induced excitotoxic cell death in the hippocampus. the complex effects of genetic background on the vulnerability of neurons to injury are revealed by each strain's response, which is also dependent on the specific type of insult or the cns region that is injured. we found small but statistically significant differences between two closely related strains, the dba/2j strain and the c57bl/6j strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study defines the differential responses of the dba/2j mouse and the c57bl/6j mouse to optic nerve crush. these include genetic networks that are associated with ganglion cell death and reactive gliosis. these findings from different inbred strains support the notion that the differential susceptibility of neurons to injury is a complex genetic trait modulated by several distinct genomic loci. in fact, several genomic loci have been mapped in the mouse that modulate the response of neurons to injury  <cit> . the first qtl mapped for neuronal injury in the mouse, on distal chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , implies susceptibility to mptp-induced death of substantia nigra neurons. recently, a locus that modulates the response of retinal ganglion cells to axon damage  was mapped to chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a qtl in the hippocampus that modulates excitotoxic susceptibility to cell death was mapped to distal chromosome  <dig>  thus, at least three loci are known that can modulate the susceptibility of neurons to injury. each locus was mapped using different types of neurons  and a different type of insult . nonetheless, we can see that different regions of the genome affect neuronal survival. there is every reason to believe that this complex trait will include even more loci to produce specific susceptibility phenotypes among different strains of mice.
