BACKGROUND
the atnhx <dig> gene encodes the most abundant vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter in arabidopsis thaliana, and mediates the transport of both k+ and na+ into the vacuole  <cit> . constitutive over-expression of atnhx <dig> and homologues from other plants have been shown to confer significant salt tolerance in a variety of plant species as a result of increased vacuolar sequestration of sodium ions . the importance of atnhx <dig> to salt stress tolerance was further demonstrated when t-dna insertional mutant nhx <dig> 'knockout' plants lacking a functional antiporter were shown to be more salt sensitive than wild-type arabidopsis  <cit> . additionally, it was found that nhx <dig> mutants exhibit an altered phenotype under normal growth conditions, including smaller cells, smaller leaves, and other developmental irregularities, associated with altered k+ homeostasis brought about by the lack of atnhx <dig>  these results suggested that atnhx <dig> is associated with other cellular processes that are not necessarily related to salt tolerance. subsequently, the atnhx <dig> coding region driven by the camv 35s promoter was introduced into the nhx <dig> knockout line. these 'rescued' plants  displayed atnhx <dig> activity, and a phenotype similar to that of wild-type plants  <cit> .

the transcriptional profile of the atnhx <dig> 'knockout'  line has been analyzed previously  <cit> . that study examined the differences in transcript level using the affymetrix®  <dig> k 'full genome' genechips® to look at the differences of expression levels between wild-type and nhx <dig> plants grown in the absence of salt stress, and also to examine the difference in relative gene expression changes that occurred after exposure to two weeks of salt stress. it was found that there was little overlap between the two comparisons suggesting that the role of the antiporter as part of the salt stress response machinery is distinct from its role under normal growing conditions. the previous study  <cit>  also suggested that atnhx <dig> is important to the expression of several cellular processes, including components of cell structure, protein processing and trafficking, and energy balance, although atnhx <dig> did not appear to dramatically affect the expression of many other transporters.

this report further establishes and clarifies the influence of atnhx <dig> on gene expression, limiting the analysis to only those transcripts that respond to salt stress, and including an analysis of the influence of both shorter  and longer  salt stress treatments. additionally we have employed an nhx1::nhx <dig> 'rescued' line to determine transcripts whose expression levels correlate with the expression of atnhx <dig>  this approach provides evidence of the influence of a single gene on the expression of other genes while helping to eliminate some of the non-specific effects that result from the mutation of the antiporter.

RESULTS
plants have been shown to have a "dual response" to salt stress, with an early response to the osmotic stress brought about by the more negative water potential of a salty soil solution, and a later response due to the na+ toxicity resulting from the relatively slower entry of na+ ions into the leaf tissues  <cit> . in an effort to include both components of the salt-stress response, we studied the influence of atnhx <dig> on gene expression after  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, one week, and two weeks of salt stress. this work is an extension of a previous microarray study that compared wild-type and nhx <dig> "knockout" plants before and after  <dig> weeks of salt stress  <cit> . here the added shorter salt stress treatments  and the inclusion of the nhx1::nhx <dig> 'rescued' line allowed for a more detailed analysis of the importance of atnhx <dig> to the expression of salt responsive genes. furthermore, the greatly increased number of microarray chips used here  allowed for the use of a more robust anova-based statistical analysis.

the nhx1::nhx <dig> plant line used in this study has an average increased expression of 50% of atnhx <dig> as compared to the wild-type. this level of expression were sufficient to restore the wild-type phenotype  <cit> , but was insufficient to confer meaningful salt tolerance  <cit> . also, because atnhx <dig> is normally expressed in all tissues and to a comparable level in all cells, with the exception of meristematic cells lacking vacuoles  <cit> , expression patterns under a constitutive promoter should not differ dramatically from expression under the native promoter. the objective behind using this line was to identify transcripts with expression directly affected by the presence or absence of a functional atnhx <dig> 

overview of salt-responsive transcripts influenced by atnhx1
out of the  <dig>  genes that exhibited reliable expression data,  <dig>  transcripts met the criteria of salt responsiveness, and  <dig> of these also showed a significant influence by atnhx <dig>  as delineated in materials and methods. this study focused on transcripts that showed a significant influence by both salt and atnhx <dig>  other transcripts also influenced by atnhx <dig> but not responding to the salt treatments, or responding to salinity but without restored levels of expression in the nhx1::nhx <dig> were not considered. the latter transcripts may yet be an important component of atnhx1-related processes, but due to inherent variation in expression levels or the consequences of constitutive atnhx <dig> expression, they did not meet the necessary significance criteria threshold to establish a clear relationship to the presence of the antiporter. even with an increased statistical filtering, comparisons of more salt treatments, and an analysis of salt responsive transcripts based on absolute values rather than relative values,  <dig> of the  <dig>  transcripts that showed a significant effect of atnhx <dig> in this report, were also previously shown to have an influence of atnhx <dig> on expression levels  <cit>  .

among the  <dig> salt-responsive transcripts that were significantly affected by atnhx <dig>   <dig> genes  were up regulated while only  <dig> genes  were down regulated in the absence of atnhx <dig>  with one transcript  showing increased expression after one week of salt stress, but decreased expression after two weeks of salt stress. the genevestigator® database  <cit>  was searched and most  of same transcripts were found to have at least a 20% change in expression in response to salt, drought, and/or osmotic stress, despite differing stress and growing conditions.

fifty-eight of these  <dig> genes showed an influence of the antiporter across all salt treatments  with the other  <dig> transcripts showing differential expression due to the presence of atnhx <dig> under a specific salinity treatment . the latter  <dig> transcripts were influenced by atnhx <dig> typically only in one treatment , with fewer transcripts showing this pattern under control conditions  or after the shortest salt treatment of  <dig> hours  as compared with longer exposure to salinity . the two-factor anova used in this study to determine the influence of atnhx <dig> is considered a powerful tool for the analysis of microarray experiments with multiple factors  <cit> , as it utilized all  <dig> microarray data points to distinguish between an effect of genotypes across all treatments  and a treatment-dependent effect of lines . in order to focus on atnhx1-influenced salt-responsive genes, a further statistical test was used to identify transcripts with significantly different expression levels in the nhx <dig> line relative to both wild type and nhx1::nhx <dig> lines. while atnhx <dig> influenced the expression of  <dig> genes that were not specific to a particular salt treatment, most salt-responsive genes appeared significantly impacted in conjunction with a particular length of salt stress, with more genes influenced as the duration of stress was increased. this pattern would suggest that atnhx <dig> has greater impact on the expression of other genes as the influence of salt stress shifts from initial osmotic stress to the ion stress  <cit> .

various databases were queried  <cit>  to determine the most likely functional role of the proteins encoded by the  <dig> salt-responsive transcripts showing an impact of atnhx <dig> on their expression levels. these transcripts were then classified into general functional groups to assist with the analysis.  the largest group of transcripts showing the influence of the atnhx <dig> vacuolar antiporter was comprised of  <dig> genes  with unclear functional classifications  interestingly, the percentage of unclassified transcripts was larger among the up-regulated genes  than among the down-regulated , suggesting that more novel salt-responsive genes are increasing in the absence of functional atnhx <dig> 

the remaining  <dig> transcripts encode proteins from a variety of functional groups. the majority of encoded proteins included signaling elements, dna binding elements, components of the protein processing and trafficking machinery, and enzymes involved with metabolic and energy balance of the cell. details of all salt-responsive transcripts that also showed a significant influence of atnhx <dig> are presented in table  <dig>  specific transcripts of particular interest are discussed in the subsequent sections of this report. the research community is encouraged to explore the data for all transcripts that were found to have meaningful expression levels  <cit> .

atnhx <dig> influences salt-responsive transcripts encoding signaling elements, including several putative calcium-binding proteins
thirteen salt-responsive signaling-associated transcripts were significantly influenced by the atnhx <dig> antiporter . nine of these transcripts exhibited significantly increased expression levels in the nhx <dig> line, while the expression of  <dig> transcripts showed reduced expression. six of the up-regulated transcripts showed a genotype × treatment interaction with a significant effect of atnhx <dig> being observed only after a week or more of salt treatment, suggesting that cellular signaling was not strongly impacted by atnhx <dig> until the later stages of salt stress. the only transcripts that displayed a general trend of increased expression for all salt treatments were three kinases. these included two receptor protein kinases  and a casein kinase ii  all with unknown roles, although a ck <dig> homolog, with unidentified targets, has been implicated in the response of maize to aba  <cit> .

a notable feature of the signaling elements influenced by atnhx <dig> is the number of transcripts encoding calcium-binding proteins, including  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts that were up-regulated  and  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts  down-regulated in the nhx <dig> line. at5g <dig> is a calcium-dependent protein kinase with an undetermined role, that is localized at the plasma membrane  <cit> . at1g <dig> is a phospholipase d, shown to have regulatory functions in plant growth and development as well as the stress response . the signaling transcripts with diminished expression in the nhx <dig> line included a member of the annexin family, annexin <dig> . annexins are ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins found in most eukaryotic species, playing roles in a wide variety of cellular processes. in arabidopsis, they have been implicated, though not necessarily limited to, roles in golgi-mediated secretion  <cit>  which is also one of their key roles in animal systems. moreover, annat <dig>  along with annat <dig>  have been shown to be important in ca2+-dependent signaling in response to osmotic stress and to aba  <cit> . the other calcium-binding signaling components with diminished expression in the nhx <dig> line included at4g <dig>  a transcript encoding a protein that is similar to calcium-dependent protein kinases and contains a c <dig> domain  and at3g <dig>  a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase family member  <cit> .

the presence of several calcium binding elements provides further evidence of the influence of ph and ion homeostasis on the calcium signaling network. calcium has been shown to be an important component of the sos  network, with a calcium-binding protein  in conjunction with a kinase , influencing both the expression and activity of the sos1/atnhx <dig>  a plasma membrane na+/h+ exchanger that is important to salt stress tolerance and cytosolic ph homeostasis  <cit>  a previous microarray study has also shown that ca2+ starvation induced decreased expression of atnhx <dig>  atnhx <dig> and atnhx <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , further suggesting a link between vacuolar cation/h+ antiporters and calcium levels in the cell. moreover, the c-terminal portion of atnhx <dig> itself has been shown to bind a calmodulin-like protein, with activity and ion specificity modified by the interaction, in a calcium- and ph-dependent manner  <cit> . our results provide further demonstration of the influence of ca2+ on cellular ion and ph homeostasis.

atnhx <dig> influences the expression of dna binding elements including water deficit responsive transcripts
the expression of  <dig> salt-responsive transcripts encoding dna binding elements  was influenced by atnhx <dig> . similar to the trends seen among the signaling elements discussed above, most  of the transcription factors exhibited increased expression in nhx <dig> plants and the majority of the individual transcripts were influenced by a specific salt treatment. genes encoding dna binding elements were affected by atnhx <dig> in response to both short and long terms of salt exposure whereas signaling elements were predominately influenced after longer treatments with salt. several of these genes have been shown to be associated with the plant response to osmotic stress. at4g25490/cbf <dig> and at1g <dig>  which displayed increased expression in the nhx <dig> line are members of the dreb transcription factor family shown to be involved in the response of plants to different environmental stimuli by binding to dehydration-responsive element  promoter regions of stress-inducible genes  <cit> . cbf <dig>  also known as dreb1b, has been shown to be involved in increasing tolerance to low temperatures, and shows a response to aba treatment  <cit> , and was also recently shown to be regulated by the circadian clock  <cit> . conversely, expression of at4g27410/rd <dig> was reduced in the nhx <dig> plants. rd <dig> is a drought- and salt-induced transcript belonging to the nac gene family, that is also part of an aba-dependent stress-signaling pathway  <cit> . the altered expression of these transcripts highlights the impact of atnhx <dig> on known and predicted components of drought stress-related pathways.

another transcript with an established role in the environmental stress response and influenced by the presence of the atnhx <dig> was a transcriptional co-activator, at3g24500/atmbf1c, that exhibited a 3– <dig> fold increase in expression as a result of the nhx <dig> mutation with  <dig> hours of salt stress. over-expression of atmbf1c in arabidopsis enhanced the tolerance of the plants to different stresses , possibly due to perturbation of the ethylene-response signal pathway  <cit> . moreover, plants over-expressing atmbf1c demonstrated increased expression of several genes   <cit>  that were also shown to be significantly influenced by atnhx <dig> in this study, suggesting a possible relationship between altered ion homeostasis and stress-induced hormonal responses.

a heat shock transcription family member  showed a significant influence of atnhx <dig> after  <dig> hours of salt stress. the altered level of expression of this gene may reflect another aspect of the disrupted response to stress in the nhx <dig> line. however it is also possible that this gene is part of the protein processing network that is disrupted in the absence of atnhx <dig> .

other atnhx1-influenced transcripts encoding putative dna binding elements have not been associated with abiotic stress response previously. at3g56980/obp <dig>  which increased in expression after  <dig> hours of salt treatment, is a transcription factor shown to target genes that are inducible by salicylic acid, and is important to normal plant development  <cit> . at5g <dig>  a gata-type zinc finger family member also influenced by atnhx <dig> in a salt-independent manner, has been shown to be induced by nitrate, and to be important to chlorophyll synthesis and glucose sensitivity  <cit> . another gata-type zinc finger family member  was also influenced by atnhx <dig> significantly following at one week of salt stress. although the role of this transcript in adult plants is not clear, bme-zf has been shown to act as a regulator of seed germination during cold stratification  <cit> , which may reflect a role in the response to environmental stimuli similar to other gata-type genes.

the nhx <dig> plants have been shown to have altered leaf development, in addition to increased salt sensitivity  <cit> , and the expression of several transcription factors associated with leaf morphology and development were influenced by atnhx <dig>  while most developmental genes are expected to be independent of salinity effect, two genes were significantly influenced by atnhx <dig> under specific salt treatments. the expression of at2g <dig>  encoding the tousled gene, was decreased in the nhx <dig> line after  <dig> hours of salt stress. tousled interacts with chromatin regulators and its expression normally increases in dividing cells  <cit> . in addition, at4g00850/atgif, involved in leaf growth and morphology  <cit>  showed a significant effect of atnhx <dig> after two weeks of salt stress. possibly, these factors contribute to the altered gene expression that is associated with the nhx <dig> phenotype  <cit> .

atnhx <dig> is associated with sulfur metabolism
of the  <dig> atnhx1-influenced transcripts with an assigned or putative function,  <dig> transcripts, found on table 2c, encode genes with metabolism or energy functions not directly associated with cell structure or cell growth . the majority of these transcripts had significantly lowered expression in the nhx <dig> line, in contrast to the overall patterns of genes showing mostly increased expression in the absence of atnhx <dig>  this pattern would suggest an overall decrease of metabolism- and energy processes-related genes in the knockout plants.

twelve of the  <dig> metabolism/energy-related transcripts down-regulated in the nhx <dig> plants were generally decreased in the nhx <dig> line over all treatments. on the other hand, the transcripts with increased expression in nhx <dig> plants were responsive to particular lengths of salt stress. these results indicated that, though in general gene expression was enhanced in the nhx <dig> line to compensate for altered ion homeostasis, metabolic and energy processes were compromised in the absence of atnhx <dig> 

at least  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts with diminished expression over all salt treatments in the nhx <dig> line appeared to be associated with sulfur/sulfate metabolism pathways. transcripts encoding adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-kinase , a 5'-adenylylsulfate reductase/paps reductase homolog , and a homocysteine methyltransferase  have well established roles in sulfur metabolism  <cit> . the diminished expression of these transcripts would suggest a decrease in the synthesis of both glucosinolates and methionine within the leaves of the nhx <dig> plants. other sulfur-related transcripts were also diminished over all treatments in the nhx <dig> line, encoding a glutathione s-transferase  a putative glutaredoxin , and cyp79f <dig>  a protein that mediates the formation of glucosinolates that are derived from methionine  <cit> . additionally, a glutathione peroxidase , which is known be regulated by abiotic stress  <cit> , was down-regulated in the nhx <dig> line specifically with  <dig> hours of salinity stress.

there are several other down-regulated transcripts that are also likely to play a role in sulfur assimilation pathways. opr <dig>  catalyzes the middle step in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, has been associated with the plant response to environmental stresses, and influence the sulfur metabolic pathway  <cit> . these results highlight a link between s-assimilation/metabolism and the expression levels of the atnhx <dig> antiporter, as also suggested by a study using transgenic brassica plants overexpressing atnhx <dig>  <cit> .

atnhx <dig> influences cell wall metabolism and components of cell growth
thirteen salt-responsive, atnhx1-influenced transcripts, were associated with cell wall metabolism and cell growth . nine of these exhibited increased expression in the nhx <dig> plants, mostly after exposure to salt stress of two days or longer. the up-regulated cell wall-associated genes included at5g57560/tch <dig> – encoding an endo-xyloglucan transferase that has been shown to be rapidly up-regulated in response to many environmental and hormonal stimuli  <cit> , a galactosyltransferase , a galacturonosyltransferase , a polygalacturonase family member , a putative cinnamoyl-coa reductase , and a 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase . transcripts encoding proteins with cell-wall associations also had diminished expression in the nhx <dig> line, including two cellulose synthase-like genes  that were diminished with all treatments, and a pectinacetylesterase  transcript that was diminished after two weeks of salt stress.

the altered expression of the above-mentioned transcripts associated with cell size and structure, in addition to some of the transcription factors mentioned earlier, are likely to be involved in the altered developmental phenotype of the nhx <dig> line, showing smaller cells, smaller leaves and diminished growth  <cit> . there are also four salt responsive transcripts displaying altered expression levels in the absence of the atnhx <dig> that are part of cell expansion and growth. under control conditions a cell division gene  has increased expression in the nhx <dig> line whereas with  <dig> hours of salt stress a cyclin family protein  shows decreased expression. two putative expansins also show increased nhx <dig> expression levels  at  <dig> hours and one week of salt stress, respectively. intracellular ion and ph homeostasis is important to the regulation of cell volume and cell cycle progression  <cit> , and in mammalian systems, calcium-regulated sodium/proton exchange activity has been implicated in carcinogenesis and proliferation  <cit> . the diminished cell size of plants lacking atnhx <dig>  <cit>  can be a consequence of the roles played by atnhx <dig> in ion and ph homeostasis, and the influence of the antiporter on calcium signaling and vesicular trafficking processes . whether the absence of functional atnhx <dig> can change the rate of cell proliferation remains to be demonstrated.

atnhx <dig> influence the expression of protein processing and trafficking components in response to salt stress
fourteen of the atnhx1-influenced salt-responsive genes appeared to play roles in the processing and trafficking of other cellular components and proteins . nhx <dig>  the yeast orthologue of atnhx <dig>  has been shown to play an important role in protein trafficking in yeast  <cit> , and the regulation of endosomal ph by nhx <dig> controls the vesicle trafficking out of the endosome  <cit> .

eleven of the salt-responsive protein processing/trafficking components had increased expression due to the absence of atnhx <dig>  with seven of these transcripts not specific to a particular salt stress treatment, suggesting an influence of atnhx <dig> over the entire range of the studied stress treatments.

the impact of atnhx <dig> on vesicular trafficking is reflected by the altered expression of at1g <dig>  encoding rab <dig>  a small gtp-binding ras-related protein, in the nhx <dig> line. rab gtpases are part of the organization of intracellular membrane trafficking, including vesicle formation, vesicle motility, and vesicle tethering  <cit> , and rab7-related genes are important for the regulation of the late steps of endocytotic pathway. the overexpression of a rab <dig> homolog stimulated endocytosis and conferred tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . also a rice homologue of this gene was differentially regulated by both aba and salinity and was implicated in vesicular traffic to the vacuole  <cit> .

the altered expression pattern of an exocyst subunit exo <dig> family protein  may be a further indication of the role of atnhx <dig> in vesicular trafficking. though not yet fully characterized in higher organisms, the exo <dig> family members are important to vesicle docking and membrane fusion as well as regulation of actin polarity and transport of exocytic vesicles in yeast  <cit> . also two kinesin-related transcripts  showed an altered expression pattern. kinesins are key to the intracellular transport system .

four salt-responsive transcripts with roles in protein processing that are influenced by atnhx <dig>  emphasize the role of ion homeostasis on the proper folding and function of other proteins. these include two dnaj-type genes , a prefoldin , and a transducin/wd- <dig> repeat containing gene . the altered expression of these genes would suggest that the absence of atnhx <dig> induces the instability of other proteins. also, the altered expression of subtilases  and a 26s proteasome regulatory subunit  suggest a possible influence on protein degradation pathways.

a salt-responsive myosin xi subunit was also influenced by atnhx <dig> . myosin xi mutants have been shown to be defective in both organelle movement and polar auxin transport  <cit>  through the action on several vesicle-mediated processes. the altered expression of both a nuclear transport factor  and a chloroplast outer membrane translocon subunit  would suggest a potential influence of atnhx <dig> on trafficking of cellular components to organelles. additionally, atnhx1-influenced transcripts in other functional categories may also be related to a role of the antiporter as part of vesicular trafficking. for example, at2g <dig>  encoding a member of the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase family  is homologous to the yeast gene rer <dig>  was shown to be important to vesicular processes and organelle integrity  <cit> .

most salt-responsive transporters genes are not significantly influenced by atnhx1
the arabidopsis nhx family is comprised of  <dig> endomembrane  and  <dig> plasma membrane-bound  members and in the absence of atnhx <dig>  compensation by the other atnhx members might be expected, in particular when the plants are exposed to salt stress. however, our data did not show significant changes in the expression of any of the atnhx2- <dig> transcripts either in nhx <dig> or nhx1::nhx <dig> plants in response to salt. additionally, though the differences of atnhx <dig> signal detection were at 27% and 160% of wild-type levels  for the nhx <dig> and nhx1::nhx <dig> lines, respectively, the other transporter genes did not show a significant difference of expression levels between lines regardless of the salt treatment used .

a few salt-responsive transporters did show an apparent affect of atnhx <dig> on expression levels . a putative phosphate transporter  showed an overall increased level of expression in the nhx <dig> plants, possibly as a result of an imbalance of phosphate ions as proton efflux from the vacuole is changed in the nhx <dig> line. a cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channel  also showed increased expression in the nhx <dig> line. cngcs comprise a family of  <dig> members in arabidopsis, activated by direct binding of cyclic nucleotides and regulated by cam  <cit> . they can provide a significant pathway for the non-selective uptake of ions  and several family members were up-regulated or down-regulated by salt stress  <cit> . since an increase in cellular cgmp was shown to occur during salt and osmotic stress  <cit> , and the expression of atcngc <dig> was shown to be up-regulated in plants exposed to cgmp  <cit> , it could be hypothesized that the overexpression of atcngc <dig> is related to the na+-induced k+deficiency. lastly, the expression of a nodulin-related gene  was increased in the nhx <dig> line with one week of salt stress, and the expression a cation efflux/metal tolerance family gene  was decreased with  <dig> hours of salt stress. the role of these putative transporters has yet to be elucidated.

little is known about the influence of atnhx <dig> on the expression/activity of other transporters within the plant cell. previous work showed that atnhx <dig> influenced the expression of a few genes encoding putative transporters  <cit> . however, as noted by gong, et al.  <cit> , previous microarray studies of salt stress in arabidopsis  did not demonstrate significantly altered expression of transporters, such as atnhx <dig> or sos <dig>  which are known to contribute to ion homeostasis and salt tolerance  <cit> . furthermore, a wide survey of available arabidopsis microarray data suggested that only approximately  <dig> transcripts encoding putative cation transporters showed a significant response to salt or drought stress, with less than a 10% overlap between studies  <cit> . this emphasizes the influence of the experimental design on the expression profiles, suggesting a high level of inherent variability. several factors might interfere with the detection of transcriptional changes in the genes encoding these transporters during salt stress, such as relatively low levels of expression or post-translational mechanisms that can modify the transporters affinity, selectivity, and/or its kinetics without affecting transcript expression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a unique feature of this study is the utilization of both an nhx <dig> 'knockout' line and a 'rescued' mutant line  to identify transcripts with expression changes directly related to the presence of a single gene, atnhx <dig>  a previous study of the influence of atnhx <dig>  <cit>  on gene expression, was limited to only the nhx <dig> line in comparison to wild-type before and after the exposure of the plants to long-term  salt stress. this work is a logical extension of the findings from the previous publication, because it provides novel aspects of the influence of the antiporter, especially as part of the salt stress response. we have provided evidence that atnhx <dig> has a larger effect on salt responsive transcripts with increased salt stress duration rather than during the early exposure, emphasizing the increased importance of the antiporter during the later ionic effects of salt stress. nonetheless the detection of atnhx1-influenced salt-responsive transcripts during the earlier salt stress treatments, and the presence of  <dig> transcripts that appeared influenced regardless of any particular stress treatment, also highlights the role of atnhx <dig> throughout salt stress exposure. the use of short- and long-terms of sub-lethal levels of salt stress, together with the nhx1::nhx <dig> line, facilitated the elucidation of adaptive responses that are influenced by the vacuolar antiporter.

in line with its importance to salt stress tolerance, our results demonstrate that atnhx <dig> influenced transcripts with known roles in the response to water deficit stress. we have additionally provided further evidence that atnhx <dig> impacts the expression of other components of the response of arabidopsis to stress. recently, it has been shown that atnhx <dig> activity can be modulated by calcium levels within the cell  <cit> , and our results demonstrated that several ca2+-binding elements were also affected transcriptionally by the presence of the antiporter protein. furthermore, in addition to many uncharacterized transcripts, atnhx <dig> also showed an impact on the transcription of several other key cellular processes including: sulfur metabolism, vesicular trafficking, protein processing, energy transfer processes, and cell growth/structure.

up-regulation of most of the atnhx1-influenced salt-responsive transcripts in the absence of atnhx <dig> would suggest the activation of compensatory mechanisms in the nhx <dig> plants. nevertheless, the decreased expression in transcripts encoding proteins with roles in metabolism and energy transfer would correlate with the phenotype displayed by the knockout plants, i.e. reduction of leaf area, smaller plants, and increased salt-sensitivity  <cit> . also, the influence of atnhx <dig> on vesicular trafficking and protein processing did not appear to be associated with any particular salt stress treatment, but rather appears to be an expression phenotype of the nhx <dig> plants, further indicating that, similar to its homolog in yeast  <cit> , atnhx <dig> plays an important role in ion and ph homeostasis of the cell endosomes.

the relatively small effect of atnhx <dig> on the expression of other transporters during salt stress is noteworthy. other microarray studies have also shown little impact of salt stress on the expression of ion transporters  <cit> . it could be argued that the non-lethal salt concentrations used here and in previous studies precluded the detection of significant changes in expression of transporters, and that under these conditions ion transport may be regulated primarily at the level of activity. nevertheless, the nhx <dig> plants, in addition to being more sensitive to salt stress, are decreased in size, show developmental changes, and have decreased vacuolar h+-coupled cation transport  <cit> . this would indicate that any possible compensatory transport mechanism in the knockout plants was insufficient to maintain ion homeostasis at wild-type levels.
