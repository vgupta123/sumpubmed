BACKGROUND
milk, as the sole source of nutrition for infants, contains a potent mixture of diverse components such as milk fat globules 
 <cit> , immune competent cells and soluble proteins, for instance iga, cytokines and antimicrobial peptides
 <cit> , which can provide protection against infections in newborns
 <cit> . in addition, breast milk may have a role in tolerance induction
 <cit>  and may protect infants from developing allergies
 <cit> .

exosomes are small  membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are released into the extracellular environment upon fusion of multivesicular bodies  with the plasma membrane
 <cit> . many cells have the capacity to release exosomes, including reticulocytes
 <cit> , dendritic cells
 <cit> , b cells
 <cit> , t cells
 <cit> , mast cells
 <cit> , epithelial cells
 <cit>  and tumor cells
 <cit> . in addition, exosomes have been found in physiological fluids, such as saliva
 <cit> , plasma
 <cit> , urine
 <cit> , amniotic fluid
 <cit> , malignant ascites
 <cit> , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
 <cit>  and synovial fluids
 <cit> . several studies have suggested that exosomes, which contain proteins, mrna and microrna , stimulate and transfer surface receptors to target cells
, as well as serve as novel vehicles for genetic exchange between cells
 <cit> . as with other biological fluids, microvesicle-like particles are also present in mouse milk
 <cit>  and human milk
 <cit> . recent published studies have isolated mrnas and mirnas from bovine milk-derived microvesicles
 <cit> . one study via deep sequencing technology identified  <dig> unique mirnas originating from  <dig> mirna precursors  in human breast milk exosomes and found that, out of  <dig> well-characterized immune-related pre-mirnas,  <dig>  were enriched in breast milk exosomes
 <cit> . recently, porcine milk was reported to contain  <dig> pre-mirnas, including  <dig> known and  <dig> novel porcine pre-mirnas, altogether encoding  <dig> mature mirnas
 <cit> .

mirnas are widespread among eukaryotes and represent key components of a conserved system of rna-based gene regulation
. many studies have demonstrated that mirnas are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and play important roles in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes
 <cit> , including development, differentiation, proliferation and immune responses. it is believed that about 60% of mammalian genes are regulated by mirnas
.

aside from being important farm livestock, pigs are also model animals for medical research. in the present study, we investigated mirnas in milk exosomes of landrace pigs in order to provide new information for investigations into the physiological functions of porcine milk.

methods
milk samples
porcine milk samples were collected between day  <dig> to  <dig> after parturition from healthy lactating landrace female pigs bred in the breeding farm of the livestock research institute . milk samples were frozen immediately after milking and were kept at-80°c until use.

preparation of exosomes from milk
porcine milk samples were centrifuged first at  <dig>  × g for 30 min at 4°c to remove mfgs as well as mammary gland-derived cells. defatted samples were then subjected to centrifugations at 4°c for 30 min at  <dig>  × g to remove residual mfgs, casein and other debris. subsequently, from the final supernatant , the membrane fraction was prepared by ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 2 h in an sw41t rotor 
 <cit> .

transmission electron microscopy 
the final fraction obtained as described above was diluted with  <dig>  m pbs and ultracentrifuged again to recover microvesicles as pellets. following fixation in 2% glutaraldehyde, microvesicles were negatively stained with uranyl acetate and observed by tem .

rna isolation and solexa sequencing
total rna was isolated from samples collected after ultracentrifugation using trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the quality of rna was examined by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and with a biophotometer  <dig> , as well as further confirmed by using a bioanalyzer . small rnas  were obtained from the total rna, 5’ and 3’ adaptors were ligated to the small rnas, then the adaptor-ligated rnas were subsequently transcribed into cdna by rt-pcr, and the samples were amplified by pcr using primers complementary to the two adaptors. the pcr products were purified and subjected to solexa sequencing  at the beijing genomics institute .

sequence data analysis
the raw reads obtained from solexa sequencing were processed to obtain clean reads by summarizing data production, evaluating sequencing quality, calculating the length distribution of small rna reads, removing low quality reads and adaptor sequences as described in previous paper
 <cit> . all the clean reads were aligned against non-coding rnas from the genbank and rfam   database to annotate and classify rrna, trna, snrna and other ncrna sequences using tag <dig> annotation software . then the selected sequences were mapped to the pig genome  using soapv <dig>  software
 <cit>  to analyze their expression and distribution. subsequently, the mirna candidates were further analyzed by mirdeep  <dig> against all known mirnas and porcine mirna precursors . all remaining candidates who did not map to any mirnas in mirbase  <dig>  were considered as potential novel mirnas. to further identify these potential novel mirna candidates, software mireapv <dig>  
 <cit>  developed by bgi was used to predict novel mirna by exploring the secondary structure, the dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the annotated small rnas which could be mapped to genome. in briefly, the sequence length should be between 18– <dig> nt, maximal free energy allowed for a mirna precursor was -18 kcal/mol, maximal space between mirna and mirna* was  <dig> nt, and flank sequence length of mirna precursor should be  <dig> nt. finally, all remaining novel mirna candidates were further subjected to mipred  to filter out pseudo-pre-mirnas. the minimum free energy must be > -20 kcal/mol or p-value was > <dig> 
 <cit> , and their secondary structures were also checked using the mfold <dig>  software
 <cit> . all data for analysis in this study have been deposited in https://mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/allinchen/mtkunxwxmzmxms8xns0yl1ryzwvob2rllze1nzeyodu2fdq5lju= with a doi: <dig> /h4dn432g.

pcr and qrt-pcr identification of known and novel mirnas
total rna  was first digested with dnase i , and 2 μg of total rna was reverse transcribed to poly  tail-added cdna using the one step primescript mirna cdna synthesis kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, a 60-nt adaptor containing a poly  structure was added to the 3’ sequence of mirnas, which were then reverse transcribed to an 80-bp cdna sequence
 <cit> . the cdna was diluted 5-fold with ddh2o, and pcr was performed on a bio-rad system in a final 20 μl volume reaction containing 2 μl pcr cdna, 10 μl of 2× pcr mix  and 1 mm of each primer. the real-time pcr thermal profile was as follows: 5 min at 95°c, 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°c, 30 s at the corresponding annealing temperature  and 72°c for 30 s, followed by 72°c at 10 min. pcr products were examined on an agarose gel to confirm that a single pcr product was generated, and 5s ribosomal rna was used as an internal control for the pcr. the mirna forward primer was designed with primer  <dig>  , and the reverse primer for mirnas was the uni-mir qpcr primer offered by the kit one step primescript mirna cdna synthesis kit .table  <dig>

mirnas target prediction and plasmid construction
two predicted novel mirnas, named mir-pc- <dig> and mir-pc- <dig>  were selected to predict their target genes in pig genome using the rnahybrid software  with its own algorithm. the 3’-utr sequences of porcine transcripts in whole genome were obtained from ensemble gene  <dig> . the 3’-utr of igf-1r contains the highly conserved binding sites for the two mirnas, and the sequence  is as follows:tcctggatcccgatcccgtgcaaacagtaccgtgcgcacgcgggcgggcggggggagagttttaacaatctattcacaagcctcctgtacctcagtggatcttc. further, the 3’-utr sequence was inserted into pmirglo vector  with xhoi and xbai double digestion to construct recombinant dual-luciferase reporter vector, named as pglo-igf-1r-3’utr . meanwhile, a plasmid containing mutant igf-1r 3′-utr, named as pglo-igf-1r-3’utr-delete , was generated by deleting the core sequence of the two mirna binding sites through dna synthesis  co., ltd.), the sequence is as follows: tcctggatcccgatcccgtgcaaacagtaccgtgcgcacgcgggcgggcggggggagagttttaacaatctattcacaagcctcctgtaccc.figure  <dig>

leuciferase reporter assay
ipec-j <dig> cells were maintained in dmem/f <dig>   and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 5 ng/ml egf  and  <dig> ug/ml insulin . lipofectamine  <dig>  was used for transfection. cells  were plated in a 96-well plate. after 24 h cultivation, cells were transfected with a mixture including 500 ng pglo-igf-1r-3’utr or pglo-igf-1r-3’utr-delete construct and 30pm of mir-pc- <dig> or mir-pc- <dig> mimics . for control, 500 ng of pmirglo-scramble including a scrambled sequence of the mirna target sequence was used. cells were collected 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-glo luciferase reporter assay system . statistical differences between treatment and control groups were determined using student’s t-test, at p <  <dig> .

bioinformatics analysis
chromosomal localization and cluster analysis of mirnas
pre-mirnas of all mirnas  were mapped to the porcine genome  according to their positions on the chromosomes. pre-mirna positions less than 10 kb apart were considered to belong to the same mirna cluster.

target prediction and gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analyses
porcine mirna targets were obtained at the genome level. in brief, mirna targets were predicted using the rnahybrid software algorithm  in 3’-utr sequences of transcripts from the whole pig genome obtained from ensembl gene  <dig> database . strict criteria  were applied to the target prediction procedure. go and kegg pathway analyses were performed using david bioinformatics resources .

RESULTS
identification of exosomes
exosomes were obtained from porcine milk by ultracentrifugation. after negative staining, approximately round-shaped porcine milk exosomes with diameters of ~50-100 nm were observed by tem, showing a greater density at the center than at the boundary .figure  <dig> 
exosomes detected by tem. the exosomes appeared as round or oval microvesicles , with a diameter of 50–150 nm and heavier density at the center than on the margin.



porcine milk exosomes contain rna
to further ascertain whether the porcine milk exosomes collected by ultracentrifugation contained rna, we extracted the samples using trizol reagent and then examined the recovered product by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. to exclude the possibility of dna contamination, total rna was incubated at 37°c for 30 min with dnase i or rnase. the extracted rna could not be digested by dnase i, while it could be degraded by rnase . these results demonstrated that the porcine milk exosomes contained rna. more interestingly, total rna of porcine milk exosomes were enriched with 5s rrna , consistent with previous studies

solexa sequencing and analysis
solexa sequencing
the srnas were enriched from porcine exosomes to construct a library for solexa sequencing. we obtained  <dig> , <dig> raw reads and  <dig> , <dig> high qualities reads after removal of low quality and contaminant reads. among the high quality reads, there were  <dig> , <dig> clean reads , representing  <dig> , <dig> unique srnas. the majority of the srnas in porcine milk exosomes were 18– <dig> nt in length , with  <dig> , <dig> reads  representing  <dig>  unique srnas , including mirnas and other srnas, such as rrna, trna, snrna, snorna, scrna, small recognition particle rna , repetitive sequence elements and unannotated sequences, which could be mapped to the pig genome. blast searching with the mirbase  <dig> , identified a total of  <dig>  reads, representing  <dig>  unique known mirnas. due to rna bias editing, 5’ modifications and 3’ modifications, many pre-mirnas produce multiple mature mirna isoforms, namely isomirnas, as described in many studies
. in the subsequent analysis, all isomirnas generated from the same precursor were considered one type of mirna. consequently, these  <dig>  unique mirnas corresponded to  <dig> known mature mirnas . in addition, we identified  <dig> novel mature mirnas . among the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> have not been deposited as porcine mirnas in mirbase  <dig> , but had very high similarity with mirna sequences of other species. these  <dig> mirnas are labeled “ps” , while  <dig> mirnas that have not been deposited in mirbase  <dig>  for any organism are labeled as “pc” and presented in additional file

there were  <dig> mirnas with more than  <dig> counts and  <dig> mirnas with less than  <dig> counts. the top  <dig>  top  <dig>  top  <dig> and top  <dig> mirnas accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads, respectively . the top  <dig> mirnas were ssc-mir-193a-3p, ssc-mir-423-5p, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-181a, ssc-mir-30a-3p, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-let-7a, ssc-let-7f and ssc-let-7c. with  <dig>  counts  , ssc-mir-193a-3p ranked first among all mirnas reads.figure  <dig>

identification of mirnas by pcr and sequencing
to verify the deep sequencing results, we selected randomly  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> predicted novel mirnas for pcr amplification . subsequently, the  <dig> newly predicted mirnas were cloned and sequenced. the results showed that  <dig> sequences were fully matched, while  <dig> sequences had one or two mismatched nucleotides . however their seed sequences remained unchanged. simultaneously, the abundance of some novel mirnas predicted by solexa sequencing was confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr. the abundance of most mirnas observed by qpcr of the sample pool and by sequencing were generally consistent .figure  <dig>

expression of  <dig> predicted novel mirnas in the sample pool detected by qrt-pcr. trends in relative expression by qrt-pcr and counts from solexa sequencing of mirnas, except for pc- <dig>  were consistent.

target verification of mir-pc- <dig> and mir-pc- <dig> against 3’utr of igf-1r using luciferase report assay
to investigate whether the predicted mir-pc- <dig> and mir-pc- <dig>  were functional novel mirnas, target genes were predicted, and mir-pc-86/ mir-pc- <dig> were found to directly target igf-1r 3’utr sequence. the full-length 3’utr of igf-1r mrna was inserted downstream of the luciferase gene in the pmirglo dual-luciferase mirna target expression vector reporter plasmid, and the seed sequence was also delete to disrupt mir-pc-86/ mir-pc- <dig> binding . the wild-type  or delete  plasmid was co-transfected with the mir-pc- <dig> and mir-pc- <dig> mimics into ipec-j <dig> cells. forty-eight hours after transfection, the luciferase activity of the mir-pc- <dig> and mir-pc- <dig> group were significantly lower than that of the nc group  respectively, and the reduction was rescued in the delete group . thus, igf-1r was initially confirmed as the target of mir-pc- <dig> and mir-pc- <dig> 

genomic localization of pre-mirnas
to further establish the presence of mirna precursors in the genome, all mature mirnas  were mapped to the s. scrofa genome . as a result,  <dig> known mature mirnas were mapped to  <dig> pre-mirnas, and  <dig> novel mirnas were mapped to  <dig> pre-mirnas on the chromosomes. our analysis revealed that the genomic density distribution of porcine milk pre-mirnas  was heterogeneous , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pre-mirnas for 1 m of genomic sequence. chromosomes with the highest and lowest densities of pre-mirnas were chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> , respectively. interestingly, the medium-length x chromosome  was an exception by encoding an intermediate number  of pre-mirnas, corresponding to  <dig>  pre-mirnas for 1 m of genome sequence, but yet contained the most clusters.figure  <dig> 
distribution of  <dig> mirna clusters. the number of base points near different bars indicates the number of clusters in the chromosome. the relative vertical dimension of the point on the bar represents the location of cluster. the label “number <dig> /number2” above every bar indicates the value of “pre-mirnas/mature mirna”.



in addition, we observed many mature mirnas having multiple mirna precursors located in the same or different chromosomes. of the novel predicted mirnas,  <dig> pre-mirnas had two copies in the genome,  <dig> pre-mirnas had  <dig> copies,  <dig> pre-mirnas had  <dig> copies,  <dig> pre-mirna had  <dig> copies and  <dig> pre-mirnas were unique. with regard to known mirnas,  <dig> pre-mirnas had  <dig> copies,  <dig> pre-mirnas had two copies and  <dig> pre-mirnas had only one copy.

mature mirnas
it is well accepted that only one of two strands generated from a precursor is preferentially incorporated into rna-induced silencing complexes , whereas the complementary strand  may be degraded. closer examination of mature mirnas generated from pre-mirnas showed that precursor mirnas could be divided into three groups : pre-mirnas only with the left-arm sequence , pre-mirnas only with the right-arm sequence or both. most pre-mirnas seemed to be single-arm mirnas , while  <dig> pre-mirnas possessed both 5p and 3p sequences . further analysis of the  <dig> coupled mature mirnas indicated that most of the pre-mirnas had no significant difference in abundance between the 5p-arm and 3p-arm sequences . some mirnas had different expression levels between the two strands. for example, ssc-mir-193a-3p had  <dig>  counts, ranking first among all mirnas, while ssc-mir-193a-5p had  <dig>  counts. conversely, mir-423-5p had  <dig>  counts, while its complementary strand, mir-423-3p, had only  <dig> reads, and which was shared by mir- <dig>  mir-30a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-27b and let-7d .table  <dig>

as described in other studies
 <cit> , some small rnas were generated from the loop or the region between the loop and stem  . in addition, we detected another interesting type of small rnas known as mirna-offset rnas, or “mornas”, which are derived from the ends of pre-mirnas, predominantly from the 5’ end, independent of the mature mirna. a good example of mornas and small rnas generated from the loop was pre-mir-30a . at the 5’ end of pre-mir- <dig>  a  <dig> nt rna sequence was found to be generated from the loop, downstream of ssc-mir-30a-5p . the findings suggest that these rnas may be only byproducts of drosha and dicer processing, or these small rnas alternatively may take part in other important regulatory functions different from those of mirnas.figure  <dig> 
three distinctive pre-mirnas identified in porcine milk exosomes.  the ssc-mir-27a precursor produced a 3p-arm mirna sequence and a loop-derived small rna.  the ssc-let-7e precursor produced a 5p-arm sequence, a 3p-arm mirna sequence and a loop-derived small rna.  the ssc-mir-30a precursor produced a 5p-arm sequence, a 3p-arm mirna sequence and a loop-derived small rna. in addition, ssc-morna- <dig>  belonging to new type of mirna termed morna, was found at the 5’ end of pre-mir- <dig> 



mirna clusters
according to criteria for classification in mirbase, pre-mirnas located on a chromosome with an interval of less than 10 kb are defined as belonging to an mirna cluster. in our analysis,  <dig>   clusters were detected . among all mirnas clusters, there were several pre-mirnas with intervening sequences of less than 1 kb, including  <dig> known clusters  and  <dig> novel mirnas clusters . we identified a typical polycistronic mirna cluster, mir-363/92a/19b-2/20b, on chromosome x. interestingly, the homologous cluster, mir-363/92a/19b-2/20b/106a on chromosome x, was located  <dig>  kb downstream of mir-363/92a/19b-2/20b , and a paraologous cluster mir-17/18a/19b-1/92a- <dig> was found on chromosome  <dig> . the organization of mirna precursors in the genome may account for variable levels of expression and regulation of mature mirnas.table  <dig>

mirna families
it is widely believed that the members of a given mirna family regulate very similar sets of target genes. apart from mirna clusters, mirna families were also recognized in the mirnas of exosomes. based on seed sequences,  <dig> mirna families were identified  to contain at least two members and the identification of novel mirnas added new members to  <dig> known families . in our study,  <dig> mirna families  were found with at least  <dig> members among all exosome mirnas. the let- <dig> family had  <dig> members, mir- <dig> family had  <dig> members  and mir- <dig> family had  <dig> members . most importantly, these mirnas were highly expressed, and let- <dig> family members , mir-181a and mir-30a-3p were enriched among the top  <dig> mirnas. however, members in the same family were highly differentially expressed. in the mir- <dig> family, mir-181a and mir-181b were dominant types with  <dig>  reads and  <dig>  reads, respectively. similarly, mir-30a was the most abundant in the mir- <dig> family. the differential expression of members in the same family may be partly due to regulation of their precursors
 <cit> . on the other hand, combined with the cluster analysis, we also observed that some mirnas shared not only the same cluster but also the same families. these mirnas included 181a/b, let-7f/mir- <dig>  181c/d, let-7a/f-5p/d-5p, 30b/d, 30c/e and mir-221/ <dig>  more interestingly, family members of the same cluster seemed to share expression patterns . as mentioned above, mir-17-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-106a, mir-18a, mir-19b, mir-92a, mir-20b and mir-92b formed a complex cluster and family network, and they also showed different expression patterns. mir-92a, mir-19b and mir- <dig> were found to be highly expressed, while mir-17-5p, mir-18a, mir-20b and mir-106a were lowly expressed. the difference in abundance of the homologous or paralogous clusters may be attributed to the copy number of mirna precursor itself or to the post-transcriptional regulation of the process of generating a mature mirna from the precursor mirna.table  <dig>

in addition, many mirna families showed low expression  in milk exosomes, such as the mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families , which are routinely expressed in specific tissues
. interestingly, all  <dig> novel mirnas families showed extremely low expression levels , indicating that these mirnas may only be expressed in certain physiology processes and may be the reason for why these mirnas have not been detected until now. mir-148a was reported to be an important biomarker for milk exosome mirnas
 <cit> . in this study, three members of this family  showed modest expression levels, suggesting that mir- <dig> may be a stably expressed mirna in exosomes of most mammals including pigs.

go and kegg pathway analyses
to better understand the role of mirnas in pig milk exosomes, potential targets of mirnas at the pig genome level were explored by using our previous method
 <cit> . we selected the top  <dig> mirnas for target prediction using rnahybrid, which found  <dig>  potential transcripts. go analysis showed that those targets were enriched in many processes , including antigen processing and presentation, mhc class ii protein complex and transcription. pathways analysis revealed these targets were enriched in  <dig> kegg pathways , which are essential for piglet metabolism , immunity  and development . the results suggest that these milk mirnas likely take part in regulation of important protective functions in piglets, including the intestinal immune network for iga production and antigen processing and presentation.table  <dig>

targets of mirnas in iga immune network
as shown by go and kegg analysis, many of the identified mirnas were predicted to participate in immunity, similar to findings of other studies
 <cit> . to further understand those mirnas, the top  <dig> predicted mirnas were selected for in-depth analysis of the iga immune network. the results showed that  <dig> of the top  <dig> mirnas are likely involved in the iga network and may target about  <dig> immune-related genes  . these results suggest that porcine milk mirnas take part in regulation of the iga network and immunity of piglets. in addition, several mirnas shared the same target gene. interestingly, all of the let- <dig> family members  could target ccl <dig>  those mirnas are proposed to play a key role in iga production in the piglet digestive tract and deserve further exploration, as mucosal immunity is critically important for the protection of newborn piglets.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, a comprehensive mirna expression profile of porcine breast milk exosomes was explored via a deep sequencing approach. we found in total  <dig> known mirnas  and  <dig> pre-mirnas producing  <dig> mature mirnas. luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the targets of two predicted novel mirnas in this study. results indicated both of them down-regulated the luciferase expression by targeting 3’utr of igf-1r. all these pre-mirnas were distributed in  <dig> clusters , and the mature mirnas could be assigned to  <dig> families . go and kegg pathway analyses show that those mirnas may participate in many different immune-related processes. an analysis of the top  <dig> mirnas showed that  <dig> of them may be involved in many regulatory aspects of the iga immune network.

a recent study of exosome mirnas in yorkshire sow milk discovered  <dig> pre-mirnas, including  <dig> known porcine pre-mirnas and  <dig> novel pre-mirnas, which encode  <dig> mature mirnas 
 <cit>  in the current study, we discovered  <dig> known porcine pre-mirnas  and  <dig> novel pre-mirnas , approximately  <dig> more mature mirnas than were revealed in the former report
 <cit> . therefore, our results substantially supplement the known pig mirnas, particularly milk exosome mirnas. interestingly, most of the novel mirnas were low in abundance , which is possibly the reason for why these mirnas were not detected in a previous study by gu et al. <cit> . further comparison revealed that mir- <dig> and let-7a, which potentially play a vital role in immunity, were found in both that study and in the top  <dig> mirnas of our study. other mirnas identified previously  were not detected in our study. furthermore, mir-148a, a potential biomarker for quality control in bovine milk
 <cit>  and human milk
 <cit> , which was found to be highly expressed throughout the lactation period of yorkshire sows
 <cit> , was only detected at a moderate level in landrace pigs in our study. mir-148a has been reported to be a tumor metastasis suppressor in gastric cancer
 <cit> , and ectopic expression of mir-148a was shown to induce apoptosis and silence bcl- <dig> in colorectal cancer cells
 <cit> . by bioinformatics analysis, mir-148a was determined to be possibly related to immunity and gastrointestinal health, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear.

mir-92a belongs to the mir-17 ~ <dig> cluster with seven mirnas  and was first described as an oncogenic mirna cluster involved in b-cell lymphoma
 <cit> . recent studies indicated that the mirna-17- <dig>  cluster directly targets the tgfb pathway in cancer cell lines in the mouse embryo stage
 <cit> . in addition, the mir-17- <dig> cluster also participates in normal development of the heart, lungs and immune system
 <cit> . mir- <dig> can promote leukemogenesis in notch1-induced t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  in vivo <cit> . overexpression of the mir-17–mir-18a–mir-19b- <dig> cluster was shown to accelerate myc-induced tumor development in a mouse b-cell lymphoma model
 <cit> . the combined results above imply that members of the cluster mir-363/92a/19b-2/20b/106a may be related to cell proliferation and development. in porcine milk, mir-363/92a/19b-2/20b  and mir-17/18a/19b-1/92- <dig> were also detected. the mir- <dig>  family is related to the development of different cells. it was reported that mir-181c/d can inhibit cell cycle and proliferation and that mir-181c regulates tnf-α <cit> . the mir- <dig> family regulates kidney development by targeting the transcription factor xlim1/lhx <dig> in xenopus <cit> . the well-known let- <dig> family is involved in oncogene expression
 <cit> , and let-7/mir- <dig> family members are expressed late in mammalian embryonic development
 <cit> . thus, these mirnas mentioned above may participate in development of the piglet digestive tract.

notably, some mirnas among the top  <dig> identified here have been reported to be related to immunity  and development . mir-193a-3p was demonstrated to regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle progression in vitro and in nude mice
 <cit> . mir- <dig> promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting polypeptide n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase  <dig> 
 <cit> , and mir- <dig> regulates erythroid differentiation in mammals by up-regulating erythroid-enriched genes riok <dig> and mxi <dig> <cit> . meanwhile, mir- <dig> is able to inhibit hl- <dig> cell proliferation by suppressing receptor  <dig> 
 <cit> , and mir-181a was believed to act as an intrinsic antigen sensitivity “rheostat” during t cell development
 <cit> . mir- <dig>  mir-181a, mir-30a-3p and let- <dig> were shown to be downregulated in colorectal cancer
 <cit> . of course, further experimental evidence is needed to verify that these mirnas are indeed related to immunity of the piglet digestive tract.

iga is a major immunoglobulin in milk
 <cit> . expression of the polymeric iga receptor  in mammary epithelial cells contribute much to the development of the immune system at the early stage of lactation
 <cit> . in the present study, some mirnas were predicted to target genes  involved in processes of the intestinal immune network for iga production in porcine milk. cd <dig> is a b-cell antigen activated during immune responses
 <cit> . cd <dig> and cd <dig> ligand  expressed on activated t cells are essential to b cell proliferation
 <cit>  and secretion of igg, iga and ige
 <cit> . sla class i were found to be expressed in the epithelial and lamina propria cells of the intestine in adult pigs and to be involved in mother-newborn interactions
 <cit> . a study in humans showed that tgf-β acts as a specific switch for iga present at early stages of development of b cells
 <cit> .

in the present study, the top  <dig> mirnas were used for iga network analysis. april was the predicted target of mir-193a-5p, which is essential to triggering iga <dig> class switch in human b cells. intestinal epithelial cells  release april after sensing bacteria through toll-like receptors, and mucosal vaccines activate iecs to induce more effective iga <dig> responses
 <cit> . the let <dig> family and mir-423-5p were predicted to target ccl <dig>  a potent and selective chemoattractant for iga antibody-secreting cells
 <cit> . ccl <dig> is known to selectively modulate immune responses, specifically the localization of t lymphocytes to the small-intestinal mucosa
 <cit> . cd <dig> and cd <dig>  which are costimulators of t lymphocytes
 <cit> , were identified as possible targets of five mirnas in our study. let-7a, let-7c, mir-181b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-423-5p were predicted to target the inducible co-stimulatory molecule , which plays a key role in regulating t-cell differentiation, t-cell proliferation, and secretion of lymphokines, providing effective help for antibody secretion by b cells
 <cit> . we hypothesize that some mirnas identified here in porcine milk regulate iga production in the intestine of piglets, which may play an important role in mucosa immunity. however, their regulatory mechanisms warrant further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study revealed  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig>  novel pre-mirnas in porcine milk, most of which were predicted to be involved in regulation of digestive tract development and immunity of newborn piglets. these findings contribute to an increased understanding of the roles of mirnas in porcine  milk exosomes and to building the foundation for understanding their physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms.
