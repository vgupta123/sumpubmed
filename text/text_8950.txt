BACKGROUND
neoplasia is profoundly important as a cause of morbidity and mortality in the domestic dog, canis lupus familiaris. in addition to its importance as a working animal and a pet species, the dog is an important intermediate model species for human tumour biology. it has a relatively large body size, often displays responses to cytotoxic or other therapeutic agents comparable to humans, and has a relatively high natural incidence of several cancers with similar biology to human tumours. dogs have been used as models for cancer therapy, such as in osteosarcoma, in the giant dog breeds, oral melanoma and non-hodgkins lymphoma, amongst others  came from adult female labrador retrievers. chromosome painting revealed they both had abnormalities in chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . one tumour  contained four translocation chromosomes involving cfa <dig>  cfa <dig>  cfa <dig> and cfa <dig> , t; t; t; der  <dig> ); the second one  had a deletion of cfa11q and trisomy of cfa <dig> . an attempt to isolate the translocation chromosomes by fluorescence activated chromosome sorting had not allowed complete purification of these chromosomes but pcr of sequence tagged sites , on sorted preparations, had shown that sequences in the first  <dig> mb of cfa  <dig> and the last  <dig> mb of cfa <dig> were present in the le tumour genome, but missing when t was excluded. rearrangement in the transforming growth factor beta receptor  <dig> gene  was implied as only a portion of the exonic sequences could be obtained by pcr of dna in this preparation. in addition to this altered copy of tgfbr <dig>  the tumour still had at least one normal coding sequence of the gene. this tumour sequence was identical to that obtained from blood dna of the same individual. at least one normal coding sequence of tgfbr <dig> was also present in the tumour me. here we extend our search for molecular alterations of cfa <dig> that could be linked to canine sarcomas and present a case report involving the loss of heterozygosity in a region harbouring two tumour suppressor genes.

RESULTS
further characterisation of derivative chromosomes by bac hybridisation
to obtain a more detailed description of rearrangements in chromosome  <dig> in these fibrosarcomas, eleven canine bacs spaced at intervals along chromosome  <dig> were used to probe tumour metaphases, in some cases in combination with chromosome paints identifying translocation partners . for le, the distribution of bac hybridisation suggests that the der <dig> and t chromosomes originate from one chromosome  <dig> whilst t and t originate from the other . however, the pattern of rearrangements in derivative chromosomes is complex. the der <dig> chromosome contains both centromeric and telomeric sequences in an inverted arrangement, whilst central parts of this chromosome  <dig> are found in t . t contains the centromere proximal region of cfa <dig>  although no bacs more telomeric than 375-f <dig> hybridised to this chromosome, chromosome painting suggests that more than half of the normal cfa <dig> is present, so there may be some further interstitial insertion of sequences not represented by the bacs used here. more telomeric bacs hybridised to t but, again, these showed rearrangement such that 381-h <dig> has a sub-telomeric position whilst bacs which lie distal to this in the normal chromosome are now placed near the centre of the derivative. the translocation break/fusion point is close to rp81_381-n <dig> with bacs derived from centromere proximal sequence found distal to this position in the fusion chromosome.

*na = data not available.

for me, bacs telomeric of rp81_381-h <dig> did not hybridise to the derivative chromosome, but rp81_381-h <dig> itself did . there was also lack of signal from rp81_376-m <dig> on the derivative, suggesting interstitial deletion of the derivative chromosome in the area of this bac. in independent rh mapping studies the bac 381-f <dig> is placed on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig>  telomeric to 373m <dig>  <cit> .

loss of heterozygosity
for le, genomic dna from blood and tumour was available, while only tumour dna could be obtained for sample me. loss of heterozygosity on cfa <dig> was analysed for the le fibrosarcoma. forty-five microsatellites distributed across the chromosome were studied . complete loss of heterozygosity  was observed for marker camc <dig> , and a substantial loss  for marker camc <dig>   . the region between these two markers contains sequences orthologous to the human genes coding for the proteins p15ink4b, p16ink4a and p14arf. the first one is coded by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2b gene , while the other two are coded by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a  . a marker  within the canine cdkn2b-cdkn2a region was uninformative . most other markers showed no change between tumour and blood, but one further marker, , showed partial loss of one allele . for marker camc <dig>   a discrepancy was observed in the results corresponding to the blood and the tumour; the former presented a heterozygous genotype, while the tumour had a single allele that was different to either of those observed in the blood.

*microsatellites are listed according to their position in ensembl's canfam  <dig>  . the position of exons within the cdkn2b-cdkn2a gene cluster is provided, along with the position of the gap between contigs  <dig> and  <dig>  and the location of tgfbr <dig>  §the numbers in the genotype columns correspond to the pcr product sizes  of the alleles, as determined by the sequencing instrument.

cdkn2b and cdkn2a sequencing from tumour dna
cdkn2a and cdkn2b have not been fully described in the dog. no mrnas or ests that completely define these genes are available, and gene prediction programmes do not fully agree with each other or with those est that are available. in addition, the area is extremely gc rich and has proved difficult to clone or to sequence, containing a gap in the camfam  <dig>  genome assembly  <cit> . alignments with human and other cdkn2a/b rnas appear to be the best guide to gene structure. we used these to design pcr primers. to determine whether the expected remaining copy of these genes had any mutations in tumour le, the predicted exonic sequences, and their flanking intronic sequences, were investigated. since the gap in the dog reference sequence is where cdkn2a exon 1α is expected to be present , it was not studied. however, a pcr product could be obtained for the predicted exon 1β; this sequence was identical to that observed in blood dna from the same individual, and to the sequence in the reference genome. in contrast to this, for cdkn2a no pcr products of exon  <dig> could be obtained from tumour le's dna in spite of repeated attempts, but the sequence was obtained from blood dna and it contained no difference when compared to the reference genome.

when using dna from tumour as template, no pcr products could be obtained for cdkn2b exons  <dig> and  <dig> and their flanking intronic sequences. in le's dna from blood, the sequence of cdkn2b exon  <dig> was the same as in the reference genome. exon  <dig> of this same gene could not be pcr-amplified from tumour le but it was amplified using dna from blood, and then cloned and sequenced. the results showed that this individual was heterozygous, having one allele with the same sequence as the reference genome  as well as a shorter allele . at the amino acid level the first allele would have five gly residues followed by four tandem copies of the sequence glyaspglygly , while the second allele would consist of five gly followed by only  <dig> copies of the tetrapeptide  .

cdkn2b exon  <dig> polymorphism in the dog
to investigate whether the shorter allele could be related to the development of the neoplasia, the exon was was amplified using dna from blood of  <dig> dogs of  <dig> different breeds. the size of the pcr products was determined by capillary electrophoresis and products corresponding to the different sizes were sequenced directly . seven different alleles were found . the most frequent allele was p. , which corresponds to the reference sequence and was found in all breeds studied. alleles p.  and p.  were also observed. additionally,  <dig> alleles were rarer in this sample set; the shortest being p.  in cardigan welsh corgis, and the longest p.  in a rottweiler. among these blood samples,  <dig> corresponded to flat-coated retrievers; of these  <dig> had histiocytic sarcoma and  <dig> were non-affected dogs aged  <dig> years or more . the distribution of the alleles was not significantly different between these two sets . all breeds except boxer  and shih tzu  were polymorphic at this position

other cdkn2b and cdkn2a polymorphisms in the dog
to search for additional polymorphisms in these two genes, exon  <dig> of cdkn2b was studied using dna from blood samples from a bernese mountain dog, four boxers, nine flat-coated retrievers , two golden retrievers and a labrador retriever. no polymorphisms were seen in the coding region or the flanking intronic bases.

exon  <dig> of cdkn2a was also sequenced from dna obtained from blood samples from three bernese mountain dogs, four flat-coated retrievers with histiocytic sarcoma, and five flat-coated retrievers free from tumours, two golden retrievers and four labrador retrievers. a coding snp was identified that led to a non-synonymous change in the predicted codon  <dig> of exon  <dig> that is shared by both p16ink4a and p14arf. the polymorphism was a g.1206a>g transversion that corresponds to a p.gln79arg change in the predicted amino acid sequence of p14arf  and an asn to asp change in the p16ink4a reading frame . both alleles were found in all breeds studied, except in the boxer where all four individuals were homozygous for the reference sequence. in the flat-coated retrievers half of the histiocytic sarcoma cases were gg homozygous and the rest ag heterozygous, while two controls were homozygous gg and three were heterozygous.

discussion
a previous analysis of two canine fibrosarcomas with rearrangement of chromosome  <dig> was followed up by bac mapping. in both tumours this revealed that rearrangements were more complex than had been seen using chromosome painting. in le all chromosomes containing fragments of chromosome  <dig>  except t, showed interstitial deletions and or rearrangements. in me a deletion around bac m <dig> was observed. loss of heterozygosity  on chromosome  <dig> was studied in le's tumour. marker camc <dig>   presented an allele in the tumour which was different from any of those in the blood. this result was confirmed in two independent experiments. this marker is within a gene desert, with no proven transcripts encoded or genes modelled within about a megabase. our data does not show whether this marker is close to a rearrangement. fh <dig> , which shows loh, is also some way from the nearest known gene. in this case more proximal markers are not informative. it seems likely that, in the tumour, the der <dig> and t chromosomes have lost some sequences in this region, which is near the proximal chromosome breakpoint in both.

loss of heterozygosity was also observed in two markers which bracket a region encompassing the cdkn2b-cdkn2a gene cluster. even though the microsatellite study pointed to loss of heterozygosity rather than complete loss of the region containing cdkn2a and cdkn2b, no pcr products could be obtained from the tumour for the genes themselves, except for cdkn2a exon 1β. the sequence of this exon showed no differences with the reference one. a microsatellite within the gene cluster could be amplified but it was homozygous in blood and thus non-informative regarding loss of heterozygosity. this microsatellite is  <dig> kb away from cdkn2a exon 1β and  <dig> kb from cdkn2b exon  <dig>  which could not be detected in the tumour dna. these results suggest that two copies of parts of chromosome  <dig> are present in the tumour, while other regions are present only once, and still others, close to the latter, are completely missing. this complex pattern is reminiscent of the alterations observed for t, where tfgbr <dig> exons  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> were observed, but not the rest of the exons  <cit> . this agrees also with the recent observation on the complexity of chromosome rearrangements in human tumours  <cit> .

both approaches, bac mapping and loss of heterozygosity, point to alterations on canine chromosome  <dig>  in the region equivalent to human chromosome 9p <dig> which is commonly deleted in human tumours  <cit>  and contains the genes cdkn2b and cdkn2a. the first codes for the protein p15ink4b, while the second codes for p16ink4a and p14arf which are proteins derived from alternate exon  <dig> sequences and use different reading frames for the common exon  <dig>  <cit> . p16ink4a and p14arf regulate the retinoblastoma protein  <dig>  and the tumour protein  <dig> , respectively. these form part of the two pathways most commonly disrupted in human tumours. recently a new protein, smarf, also coded by cdkn2a, was identified in mouse and human and localised in the mitochondria  <cit> . it has been shown to inhibit cell growth and proliferation, and to induce apoptosis in a tp53-independent manner  <cit> . cdkn2a also codes for the proteins p <dig> and p16γ which are less well understood  <cit> . in mice, disruption of either p19arf  or p16ink4b, or both, results in increased predisposition to tumour development  <cit> . in humans, homozygous deletions are the most frequent type of mutation involving these genes  <cit> , as opposed to the combination of mono-allelic deletion followed by the mutation of the remaining copy of the gene, which is the common pattern in other tumour suppressor genes  <cit> . however, alterations affecting only one of p15ink4b, p16ink4a or p14arf have been reported  <cit> . apart from homozygous deletions, 5'cpg methylation has also been observed in some tumours  <cit> . in human patients with soft tissue sarcomas, loss of cdkn2b and cdkn2a is associated with reduced survival  <cit> , while in dogs, absence or reduced levels of p16ink4a have been reported in melanoma tumours and cell lines  <cit> , as well as in osteosarcoma cell lines  <cit> . in canine non-hodgkin's lymphoma , deletion of p16ink4a or loss of cfa <dig> have been observed in high-grade t-cell nhl, without comparable alterations seen in high-grade b-cell nhl or in low grade tumours  <cit> . in this same paper, p16ink4a methylation was observed in a single low-grade t-cell lymphoma. in addition to this, in two canine mammary tumour cell lines, cmt <dig> and cmt <dig>  no expression of p16ink4a was observed, while in a third cell line  increased expression was detected  <cit> . upon transfection of a complete human p16ink4a cdna, these cell lines lost most of the characteristics of the transformed phenotype  <cit> . the sequences of cmt <dig> and of canine fibroblast cultured cells were reported to differ from the reference sequence, although the nucleotide and the aminoacid sequences are identical to the canine reference sequences used here for the second exon of p16ink4a and p14arf .

cdkn2a exon 1β codes for the n-terminus portion of p14arf. the first amino-acid residues of this protein are relatively well conserved and have an important role in binding mdm <dig> while the rest of the protein, containing a nucleolar localization signal, is poorly conserved and may be dispensable  <cit> . in chicken, exon 1α of cdkn2a has been lost and no p16ink4a protein is produced  <cit> . exon 1β is spliced to the still existent exon  <dig> but the predicted protein terminates at the end of exon 1β, with no residues from exon  <dig>  in spite of this, the protein is able to bind mdm <dig> thus preventing the induction of tp <dig> degradation and the inhibition of tp <dig> expression  <cit> . it is therefore likely that exon 1β codes for the amino acid residues required for p14arf to perform its normal role. moreover, aberrant p16ink4a transcripts have been observed in tumours  <cit>  and some of them are translated and are able to function in cell-cycle control  <cit> . in the present study only exon 1β of cdkn2a was observed in le's fibrosarcoma. it is possible that an abnormal version of p14arf could have been produced; it is unknown whether the remaining exon 1β would have been spliced to another sequence, generating an abnormal transcript and, possibly, a shorter version of p14arf, as is in the chicken. in the current study, a polymorphism was observed in exon  <dig> causing missense mutations in both p16ink4a and p14arf. the polymorphic residue is in the loop joining the second and thitd ankyrin repeats of p16ink4a. this residue is on the surface of the protein  <cit> . although it does not interact with cdk <dig>  it does seem to have a role in stabilising the structure of p16ink4a  <cit> . in other species this position is occupied by the acidic residues asp or glu, so the polar neutral asn residue seems to be unique to dogs. however, other structurally related proteins with ankyrin repeats have asn in the equivalent position   <cit> .

polymorphisms in short repeat sequences within coding exons have been observed before  <cit> , whilst somatic repeat instabilities are well documented in other species both in tumours and in some degenerative diseases. the putative first exon of cdkn2b in dogs has a predicted glyaspglygly repeat that is not found in other species. this exon is represented in the database by two ests . the multiplicity of alleles in this gene may have resulted from occasional misalignments during crossover events between homologous chromosomes, leading to the expansion and contraction in the number of ggc triplet and ggggacggcggc dodecamer repeats. no instances were observed of nonsense mutations in this region, nor were indels found that would produce shifts in the reading frame. in the case of flat-coated retrievers, which show a high predisposition to developing histiocytic sarcomas, cases and controls were found to have a similar distribution of exon  <dig> alleles. moreover, the sequences obtained from genetic material from blood samples of various breeds suggest that the variation in the number of gly residues and in the number of glyaspglygly repeats is a normal polymorphism in this species.

p15ink4b, coded by cdkn2b, and the rest of the members of the inhibitor of kinase  <dig>  protein family  have ankyrin repeats that play an important role in the folding of the protein and in intermolecular interactions with other proteins, such as the cyclin-dependent kinases  <cit> . p15ink4b and p16ink4a are similar proteins that appear to be the result of a gene duplication event  <cit> ; both have  <dig> ankyrin repeats and they appear to function in a similar manner and may be interchangeable  <cit> . however, p16ink4a has been studied in more detail. it is known, for example, that this protein's loops  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as some of the ankyrin repeats themselves, interact with cdk <dig>  <cit> . the glyaspglygly repeats predicted to exist in canine p15ink4b are immediately before helix α <dig> of the first ankyrin repeat. hence the polymorphism may not disrupt the folding or function of the protein which is dependent on the ankyrin repeats and the loops connecting them. these glyaspglygly repeats would introduce a region of small glycine residues punctuated by charged aspartates causing a difference in molecular size at the n-terminus of the protein.

p15ink4b is induced by transforming growth factor, beta  <dig>   <cit> ; this induction may be direct, through the binding of tgfb <dig> to a sequence within the promoter of cdkn2b  <cit> . in a previous study we showed that the breakpoint of the translocation chromosome t involves tgfbr <dig>  <cit>  which codes for a receptor to tfgb <dig>  however, the tumour still contained a complete coding sequence of the gene. it seems, therefore, that the pathway is disrupted at the level of p15ink4b and p16ink4a through the homozygous deletion of their coding sequences, while the possibility still remains that an abnormal p14arf could be present.

CONCLUSIONS
in fibrosarcomas studied in this work complex rearrangements of canine chromosome  <dig> were observed, causing changes in genes in the tgfb – p14ink4b pathway. study of cdkn2b showed unusual variants present in exon  <dig> of the gene in different breeds of dog, as a result of a simple repeat sequence. no instances of missense or frameshifting mutations were observed. however, it is possible that the genomic plasticity of cdkn2b observed here is connected with the rather high frequency of cancers in the domestic dog.
