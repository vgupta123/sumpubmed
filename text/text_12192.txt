BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance is a global concern. in papua new guinea , the estimated tuberculosis  incidence rate is 303/ <dig> population, with 5% multidrug resistant tb  among new cases
 <cit> . culture-based drug susceptibility testing  requires infrastructures often too sophisticated for resource-constrained settings. detecting resistance-associated mutations is a faster alternative, as shown by genotype mtbdrplus 
 <cit>  or xpert mtb/rif 
 <cit> . to monitor drug resistance molecularly, the distribution of drug resistance-conferring mutations in a given setting needs to be known, and such data is currently missing for png. we report mutations associated with drug resistance among tb isolates in the madang area of png and provide evidence for transmission of drug-resistant m. tuberculosis.

RESULTS
the patient characteristics and detailed m. tuberculosis genotypes were reported elsewhere
 <cit> . in brief,  <dig> patients were recruited in the frame of a pilot study in 2005- <dig> and  <dig> in the frame of a treatment cohort study in 2009- <dig>  history of previous tb treatment was reported in  <dig> %  of the 2009- <dig> patients, for whom data was collected. molecular analyses were performed on the dna from  <dig> successfully grown isolates and phenotypic dst was obtained for  <dig> isolates. from the six previously described m. tuberculosis lineages
 <cit> , we observed 133/ <dig>  euro-american , 39/ <dig>  east-asian , and 1/ <dig>  indo-oceanic .

overall, 27/ <dig>  isolates were resistant to ≥ <dig> drug: 15/ <dig>  monoresistant, 3/ <dig>  polyresistant and 9/ <dig>  mdr. a total of 10/ <dig>  strains were rifampicin  resistant, 21/ <dig>  isoniazid  resistant , 9/ <dig>  streptomycin  resistant, and 4/ <dig>  ethionamide  resistant.

among resistant isolates, the genes harboring drug resistance associated mutations were sequenced. the observed mutations in katg, inha promoter, ahpc promoter, rpob, embb, pnca, rpsl, rrs, gidb, and gyra are listed in figure
 <dig> 

inh resistant isolates harbored mutations in katg  or inha promoter . all isolates with katg s315t were resistant to  <dig>  mg/l inh except one, which was sensitive to this concentration of inh. on the other hand, all isolates with inha promoter mutation were sensitive at this drug concentration , thus confirming the association between inha promoter mutations and low-level inh resistance
 <cit> . among all 6/ <dig> mdr-tb isolates with either katg or inha promoter mutations, all had the katg s315t mutation, except one with an inha promoter mutation. this only mdr-tb case with an inha promoter mutation belonged to the four mdr-tb cases, which were additionally eth resistant. mutations in inha promoter have been shown to cause inh and eth cross-resistance and were thereby associated with higher risks of extensively drug resistant tb
 <cit> .

eight inh resistant strains  had no katg or inha promoter mutation. only 850 bp of katg were sequenced and mutations may therefore have been missed. however, katg mutations outside this region are rarer
 <cit> . alternatively, these strains might harbor mutation in the > <dig> other genes reported as potentially associated with inh resistance 
 <cit> .

we did not observe any ahpc promoter mutation, thought to compensate the reduced catalase-peroxidase activity resulting from katg mutations
 <cit> . because the inh resistance-conferring mutations observed here, i.e. katg s315t and inha promoter c15t, are known to be associated with a low fitness cost
 <cit> , they might not require compensation.

all rif resistant isolates harbored mutations in rpob at codons d516f, d516y or s531l except one, which did not have any mutation in the 600pb rpob fragment sequenced. dst was repeated for this case, confirming the mdr phenotype. furthermore, common rpobkatg and inha promoter mutations were excluded by genotype mtbdrplus. nevertheless, it has been estimated that mutations in the rif resistance determining region  account only for 95% of rif resistance
 <cit>  and therefore other mechanisms cannot be excluded. mutation s531l has been linked to high-level rif resistance
 <cit> , whereas d516y was associated with low-level resistance
 <cit> . mutation d516f has only been reported in kazakhstan
 <cit>  and may also cause low-level resistance. low-level rif resistance has been little considered, but could influence treatment, especially knowing that phenotypic dst outcomes may differ from the actual efficacy of the anti-tb drugs in patients
 <cit> .

str resistant isolates harbored mutations in rpsl  and rrs , as previously reported
 <cit> . one isolate was mutated at codon v77g in gidb, a mutation which was not reported before. one str resistant isolate did not present any mutation in any of these genes.

mutations in gidb have been associated with low-level str resistance
 <cit> , but were also reported in sensitive strains
 <cit> . in this study, gidb mutations a10p, l16r, e92d, and a205a were observed among strains resistant to other drugs than str. we further explored gidb mutations in whole genomes of  <dig> pan-susceptible strains representative of the six defined m. tuberculosis lineages
 <cit> . mutation gidb v77g, which we observed in one str resistant isolate from png, could not be found in any of the  <dig> pan-susceptible strains. this mutation could therefore indeed be involved in drug resistance or could be a transitory polymorphism in the population. the mutation a10p observed in one str sensitive isolate was not found in any of the  <dig> pan-susceptible genomes. mutations l16r was observed in genome sequences from lineage  <dig> strains  and e92d in lineage  <dig> strains . this supports the recent observation that gidb l16r occurred in lam strains , whereas gidb e92d occurred in beijing strains
 <cit> . a205a appeared mutated in all strains not belonging to lineage  <dig>  therefore indicating that this mutation, identified by comparison to h37rv, is a lineage  <dig> mutation. observations from the  <dig> pan-susceptible genomes suggest that most gidb mutations rather reflect m. tuberculosis lineage evolution than drug resistance.

clusters were defined for strains sharing identical spoligotype and  <dig> locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number of tandem repeats  patterns. among isolates with complete patterns, 72/ <dig>  were clustered. despite potential fitness costs associated with resistance-conferring mutations
 <cit> , the proportion of clustered strains was not significantly different among drug-sensitive  and drug-resistant  isolates of m. tuberculosis.

to distinguish between primary resistance and acquired resistance, clustered isolates sharing identical drug resistance-conferring mutations were considered. five of the  <dig>  drug-resistant isolates involved in molecular clusters shared their drug resistance-conferring mutations with other isolates in the same cluster, thus strongly suggesting patient-to-patient transmission.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides so far missing data about drug resistance-conferring mutations in m. tuberculosis isolates from madang in png. monitoring drug resistance is essential to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria, especially in diseases requiring lengthy treatments such as tb. our data suggests that not all present drug resistance associated mutations may be detected by molecular tests, which mainly focus on a subset of polymorphisms only. however, given the complex implementation of culture-based dst in resource-constrained settings, png may be well suited for an accelerated roll-out of molecular drug resistance testing in order to better tackle the emergence and the transmission of drug-resistant m. tuberculosis strains.
