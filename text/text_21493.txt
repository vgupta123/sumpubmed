BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms in mammals are driven by a clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus   <cit> . the scn is directly innervated by the retinas and photic information is transmitted to the scn via a nmda and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-dependent mechanism  <cit> . photic input to the circadian clock has differential effects on circadian rhythms depending on the timing of exposure to light. light presented in the early night delays the phase of the clock, light during the late night advances the clock, and light presented during the subjective day has little or no effect on clock phase  <cit> . photic signals during the subjective night activate a map kinase signaling pathway leading to increased transcription of several immediate-early genes  <cit>  and the core clock gene per <dig>  <cit> .

the roles of light-induced genes in the circadian clock mechanism, other than the period genes, are not well understood. for example, the best characterized of these genes are fos, egr <dig>  and nr4a <dig> . the expression of c-fos protein is commonly used as a marker for light-like activation of neurons in the scn. fos knockout mice still show behavioral circadian rhythms as well as a phase response curve to light, but the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of activity and the phase response curve are attenuated  <cit> . the threshold for photic induction of c-fos is similar to the threshold for behavioral phase shifts, suggesting a common mechanism  <cit> , however, expression of c-fos can be dissociated from behavioral shifts  <cit> . fos appears to be a component of the circadian response to light, but not one that is absolutely necessary for phase shifts to occur, and the mechanism by which fos protein is involved in photic signalling is unknown. in contrast, egr <dig> and nr4a <dig> knockout mice show normal entrainment patterns and no dysfunction in their response to light  <cit> . the expression of egr <dig> occurs over a broader area of the scn than does c-fos  <cit> , but the threshold for egr <dig> induction is lower than for phase shifts of behavioral rhythms or c-fos induction. these data suggest that egr <dig> and nr4a <dig> may not be directly involved in entrainment pathways, but the lower threshold for stimulation of expression suggests that egr <dig> may be involved in other scn outputs, such as the one which regulates rhythmic melatonin secretion from the pineal gland, which has a lower light intensity threshold for photic regulation than behavioral phase shifts.

in order to better understand the molecular events governing the response of the scn to photic input, we performed a microarray-based screen for genes rapidly induced by light, followed by a comparative evolutionary genomic analysis to identify common activation mechanisms among this gene population.

RESULTS
light-induced immediate-early genes in the scn
we used laser capture microscopy  to isolate scn tissue from mice immediately following either a  <dig> minute high-intensity light pulse or a sham light pulse. the extent of the scn was easily determined from the density of hemotoxylin-labeled nuclei. we examined a selected set of genes known to be markers of the scn, but not the surrounding tissue, to confirm that we were measuring scn gene expression. all  <dig> arrays displayed strong hybridization signals for the mrna for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide , gastrin-releasing peptide, arginine vasopressin, calbindin  <dig> k, clock, enkephalin, bmal, and glutamic acid decarboxylase  <dig>  vip produced hybridization signals that were in the top  <dig> genes on  <dig> out of the  <dig> arrays . in contrast, neural markers that are not expressed in the scn, but are expressed in scn-projecting neurons, received absent calls from all  <dig> arrays, including neuropeptide y, preprohypocretin, tryptophan hydroxylase, and tyrosine hydroxylase.

the  <dig>  probe sets on the affymetrix arrays were reduced to  <dig>  candidate transcripts for analysis based on the criteria that each probe set was identified as being present using the default settings of gcos  <dig>  software on at least  <dig> of the  <dig> arrays. the results of these probe sets are plotted in figure  <dig>  differences between light pulse and sham light pulse groups were assessed according to p-values generated using a bayesian t-test calculated using the logarithms of the signal intensities for each probe set. a total of six genes were measured as being differentially expressed using our most stringent criteria, which was the application of a bonferroni correction to the critical p-value for significance . a second group of  <dig> genes was identified as meeting a lesser criteria of p <  <dig> . all  <dig> genes of these genes were then analyzed for differences in expression using quantitative real-time pcr . all  <dig> of the genes in the first group were confirmed as having a more than 2-fold increase in expression following the light pulse, while  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in the second group were confirmed. in addition, we tested the fold-change of  <dig> additional genes that had not been identified in our microarray analysis but had previously been shown to be induced by a light pulse   <cit> . of this group, egr <dig> showed a significant increase in expression following the light pulse but no significant difference in per <dig> or per <dig> expression was detected. the identities of these genes and their fold-changes as calculated using the microarrays and qpcr are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the correlation coefficient between fold changes determined by microarray analysis and by real-time pcr was  <dig>  . there were no transcripts that showed a significant decrease in expression following the light pulse.

the failure to detect an increase in per <dig> expression was unexpected, as some previous reports detected an increase in per <dig> mrna expression within  <dig> minutes of the onset of a nocturnal light pulse  <cit> . however, we hypothesized that the increase in per <dig> might be occurring later in our study. therefore, we harvested scn tissue from mice one hour after the start of a  <dig> minute light pulse or sham light pulse,  <dig> minutes later than in our initial study. qpcr assays of these captures revealed a significant increase in both per <dig>  and per <dig>  expression after the light pulse as compared to the sham light pulse.

analysis of promoter regions of light-induced genes
we reasoned that if these light-induced genes were important to the basic mechanism of photic signalling to the scn and were activated by a common mechanism, they may share common regulatory sequences. ca2+/camp response elements  have been shown to play a critical role in circadian rhythmicity and the photic entrainment system  <cit> . we therefore took a comparative evolutionary genomic approach to ask whether all of the light-inducible genes in the scn that we detected contain conserved cre elements in their promoters. we found at least one highly conserved cre element within  <dig> kb upstream of the start codon in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes induced by light immediately following the light pulse . the only gene lacking a conserved cre element within  <dig> kb of the start codon was nr4a <dig>  most of these cre elements were highly conserved not only at the nucleotide sequence level but also in their relative positions within the promoter region in the five mammalian species examined , suggesting that these elements are important to coordinate the regulation of this group of genes. previous studies have also demonstrated that camp-dependent activation of transcription by p-creb largely depends on the presence of tata elements downstream of the cre element  <cit> . we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes with cre elements also possess tata elements in proximity to the cre element, including the  <dig> genes that showed the largest increases in expression following the light pulse. by these same criteria, per <dig> has both a conserved cre element and a conserved tata box, while per <dig> has neither. in contrast, in  <dig> other clock genes  that were not upregulated  <dig> minutes after the light pulse onset in this study, only one  had both a conserved cre element and a nearby tata box. this difference  is statistically significant .

discussion
the results of this study identify a total of  <dig> transcripts that show significant increases in expression  <dig> minutes after the onset of a light pulse during the early night. it is important to note that this study examined gene expression in only the earliest moments of the response to photic stimulation. it is likely that repeating this study at later time points would reveal additional light-induced genes.

four of the differentially expressed transcripts identified in the microarray analysis have not previously been identified as being induced by light: egr <dig>  pim <dig>  gadd45b, and tiparp. egr <dig> is a zinc-finger transcription factor of the same family as egr <dig> and egr <dig>  there is insufficient information available to generate a clear hypothesis about the function of egr genes in the scn. pim <dig> is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has anti-apoptotic functions in a variety of tissues  <cit> , but its role in neurons has not been investigated. in contrast, the known functions of gadd45b and tiparp suggest potential connections to scn function. in beta cells, gadd45b inhibits apoptosis as well as jnk and erk activation  <cit> . gadd45b has similar functions in hematopoietic cells  <cit> . gadd45b is upregulated in the hippocampus in response to electroconvulsive shock, consistent with a neuroprotective function  <cit> . if gadd45b acts to inhibit erk activation in the scn, then that would be consistent with the idea that some of these light-induced genes act to downregulate the sensitivity of the scn to subsequent stimuli, and possibly contribute to the scn's strong resistance to excitotoxicity  <cit> .

tiparp encodes tcdd-inducible poly  polymerase and is activated through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent pathway  <cit> . activation of this pathway by tryptophan photoproducts alters the expression of clock genes and inhibits glutamate-induced phase shifts in scn  <dig>  cells  <cit> . the aryl hydrocarbon receptor shares significant structural similarity with bmal <dig>  a core clock gene, and may interact directly with bmal <dig>  providing a potential substrate for altering clock function  <cit> . the induction of tiparp provides another potential mechanism for altering clock function, although the targets for ribosylation in the scn are unknown.

three genes identified in our study  were recently reported as light-induced in a study using high-coverage expression profiling  <cit> , and another gene, dusp <dig>  was also recently characterized as light-induced  <cit> . dusp <dig> encodes map kinase phosphatase  <dig> , and is now thought to play a role in the termination of the photic signalling cascade. one of the critical steps in the response of the scn to photic signaling is the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal regulated kinases , leading to phosphorylation of creb and changes in transcription  <cit> . an increase in functional mkp <dig> would reduce the sensitivity of the scn to photic stimuli, and shut down the transcriptional mechanisms turned on by light. it also might help explain the extraordinary resistance of scn cells to excitotoxicity  <cit> , by downregulating the responses of scn cells during periods of extended stimulation.

rrad, btg <dig>  and klf <dig> have not been examined in the context of circadian clock function. however, given what is known about the role of rrad in other systems, increased rrad protein would also serve to downregulate the response of scn cells to subsequent stimulation. rrad encodes a small gtpase that binds to calmodulin and cam kinase ii  <cit> . increased rrad expression is associated with the removal of voltage-gated calcium channels from the plasma membrane  <cit> , which would reduce the response of scn neurons to excitatory stimuli. in addition, cam kinase ii has already been shown to play a role in the regulation of light-induced phase delays, through actions leading to the transcription of per <dig>  <cit> . consistent with this theme of downregulating cellular responses to stimuli, btg <dig> and klf <dig> both have anti-apoptotic functions in other cellular systems  <cit> , but their role in the scn remains unknown.

the remaining five genes are well known light-induced genes: egr <dig>  egr <dig>  fos, nr4a <dig>  and jun. investigations into the function of these genes in the response of the scn to photic stimuli have been extremely limited. mice lacking functional copies of egr <dig> and nr4a <dig>  do not show altered circadian rhythms, suggesting that these genes do not play an important role in entrainment  <cit> , although there could be compensatory mechanisms in the knockout mice that mask the role of these genes. in contrast, mice lacking fos show an attenuated phase response curve to light  <cit> , suggesting that this gene is involved in the signal transduction mechanism for conveying photic information to the molecular clock mechanism. the critical factor in the response of the circadian clock to light is the increase in expression of period genes, through a mechanism that does not appear to require fos. one possibility is that mechanisms within the cell that are activated by fos protein are important for the communication of information from retinorecipient cells to other parts of the scn. another piece of evidence implicating both fos and jun in entrainment is that microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides for these transcripts into the brain inhibits the phase shifting effects of light  <cit> . in addition, the behavioral phase shifts are highly correlated with changes in fos expression, but not with egr <dig> or nr4a <dig> expression  <cit> . there have been no functional studies regarding the role of egr <dig> in the circadian clock.

we found that nearly all of the light-induced genes identified in this study had evolutionary conserved cre elements in their promoter regions, with the strongest light inducible responses coming from the combination of cre elements and associated tata boxes. on the other hand, core clock components that are not induced by light lack this combination of promoter elements, with one exception . the slower, longer-lasting increase in per <dig> relative to the other induced genes has been described elsewhere  <cit> . the loss of a conserved cre element from the per <dig> promoter may be a component of its functional divergence from per <dig>  it is likely that while the cre element helps drive transcription of light-induced genes, there are other important regulatory elements responsible for controlling the time course of expression in response to activation by p-creb. however, these data strongly suggest that the presence of the cre element drives transcription of a coordinated array of immediate-early genes in the scn in response to photic stimulation. further evidence of this is the finding that creb specifically binds to the cre sequences in the dusp <dig> promoter  <cit> . observed evolutionary conservation of cre elements among mammalian genomes that diverged at least  <dig> million years ago , such as primate-cattle divergence at about 90– <dig> mya  <cit> , and primate-rodent divergence at about  <dig> mya  <cit> , indicates that the functional role of these elements in regulation of clock genes has likely remained the same in different mammals. although this kind of in silico analysis requires further experimental evidence, and while the role of many light-induced genes in the scn remains unknown, these data support the idea that the response of the scn to photic input is not limited to pathways involved directly in entrainment.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study demonstrate the existence of previously unknown light-induced immediate-early genes in the scn. several of these genes have been previously shown to be involved in a reduction of cellular activity and/or the prevention of apoptosis. these data suggest that in addition to the responding to light by shifting the timing of the circadian clock, mechanisms exist to reduce the long-term sensitivity of the scn to light during nocturnal light exposure. most light-induced genes have evolutionary conserved cre elements in their promoter regions, supporting a common mechanism for a coordinated transcriptional response to photic input. further investigation into the functional role of light-induced genes may yield new insight into the mechanisms of circadian clock function.
