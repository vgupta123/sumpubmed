BACKGROUND
xylan, is a major structural polysaccharide in plant cells and the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature accounting for approximately one-third of all renewable organic carbon on earth  <cit>  hemicellulose is a complex of polymeric carbohydrates including xylan, xyloglucan, glucomannan, galactoglucomannan and arabinogalactan  <cit> . this together with cellulose and lignin constitute the major polymeric constituents of plant cell walls  <cit> . within the cell wall structure, all three constituents interact via covalent and non-covalent linkages with the xylan being found at the surface between lignin and cellulose where it is believed to be significant for fibre cohesion and plant cell wall integrity. due to the heterogeneous and complex structure, the complete hydrolysis of xylan requires a number of enzymes which carry out its hydrolysis by a phenomenon known as cooperativity exhibited by endo- <dig> -β-xylanase , β-d-xylosidase  and a series of enzymes that hydrolyze the side chain groups  <cit> . based on the mode of action and mechanism of catalysis xylanases have been assigned to glycoside hydrolase  families  <dig> and  <dig> however some xylanases have also been categorized to families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

agricultural substrates contain hemicelluloses which have been globally generated. the use of agricultural residues in bioprocesses not only helps to reduce the pollution problems but also serves as the alternate substrate for the production of secondary metabolites  <cit> . fungi such as aspergillus spp. and trichoderma spp. are of great significance as they produce high levels of xylanase than yeast and bacteria  <cit> . in this study, xylanase was produced using agricultural waste by aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> which was isolated and identified in our laboratory. the xylanase was purified and its biochemical properties were studied to establish its relationship with the other characterized xylanases. mass-spectrometric analysis reported that the purified xylanase is putative. moreover, purified xylanase demonstrated significant biochemical characteristics which make it a suitable industrial enzyme.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic analysis of the culture r1
the xylanase-producing fungus was isolated on agar plate supplemented with the birchwood xylan as the sole source of the carbon at  <dig> 0c. the isolate was identified based on the highest xylanase activities as shown by the clear zone of hydrolysis when flooded with  <dig>  % cong-red stain. the best isolate was selected for further studies. morphological characteristics indicated that the isolate is aspergillus. phylogenetic analysis of 18s rrna gene sequence indicated that this strain shared 99 % sequence identity with 18s rrna gene sequence of aspergillus fumigatus, hence it was assigned as aspergillus fumigatus strain r <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of strain aspergillus fumigatus strain r <dig> using the neighbor-joining method  based on 18s rrna gene sequences. bootstrap values are represented as percentage at all branches. the scales indicate  <dig>  substitutions per nucleotide and accession numbers of published strains of closely related strains are indicated



xylanase production kinetics
a submerged fermentation process was carried out with the optimized production medium as mentioned above. it was observed that aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> produced xylanase and the highest yield reached  <dig> u/ml after 96 h of cultivation with rice bran as the only carbon source and decreased after 120 h .fig.  <dig> kinetics of xylanase production aspergillus fumigatus r <dig>  after 96 h of incubation, xylanase activity was found to be highest and thereafter a decrease in production was reported 



purification of xylanase
the xylanase activity increased with the increase of incubation time and reached the peak of activity about  <dig> u/ml after 96 h of incubation. so, the enzyme was harvested for the purification. aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> xylanase was purified by fractional ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialysis and bio-gel p- <dig> gel-filtration chromatography. the result of the purification is summarized in table  <dig>  the crude supernatant was first subjected to 30–55 % fractional ammonium salt precipitation. the pellet obtained was then dissolved in minimum volume of phosphate buffer  and subjected to extensive dialysis. after ammonium sulphate precipitation, the protein with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg was obtained whilst the specific activity of the enzyme preparation increased  <dig> -fold. the dialysed enzyme sample was then subjected to bio-gel p- <dig> gel-filtration chromatography and the elution profile displayed more peaks of protein whilst a single elution peak of xylanase was obtained which indicated that xylanase of higher purity was achieved . after the final step of purification, the enzyme was purified  <dig> -fold with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg with a  <dig>  % yield.table  <dig> purification chart of xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus r1

sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and activity analysis
sds-page of the purified xylanase was performed with linear  acrylamide gradient revealed single band when stained by silver staining method . the relative molecular mass of xylanase was found to be approximately 25 kda. wong et al.  <cit>  illustrated a conserved relationship between molecular weight and pi of multiple xylanases from various microorganisms. for instance they are classified as low mw / basic  xylanases and high mw / acidic  xylanases. however, this system does not classify all xylanases from different microorganisms satisfactorily. the pure xylanase exhibited relatively clear activity under nondenaturating conditions using 2 % birchwood xylan in 12 %  acrylamide in gels. the activity was detected by congo-red staining which indicated that the xylanase was active .

mass-spectrometry and sequence analysis
mass spectrometry data showed  <dig> amino acids with  <dig> unique peptides of protein . the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the protein were estimated to be  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  respectively. putative proteins are identified using the bioinformatics tools while they exhibit sequence similarity to an extent with characterized proteins. usually, the similarity is found only in their conserved amino acid residues and no other significant region is similar to annotated proteins  <cit> . the amino acid sequence similarity and molecular structure of the protein define the enzyme classification system.  <dig> different glycoside hydrolase families have been reported  to date. enzymes within a specific family have similar three-dimensional structure  <cit>  and similar molecular mechanism  <cit> . xylanases have been classified to families  <dig> and  <dig> exclusively where family  <dig> contains monospecific xylanases.

homology modeling of xylanase
to predict the secondary structure of the protein sequence of xylanase, profile-profile alignment was performed with  <dig> non-redundant protein structures in i-tasser  employing psi-blast . the secondary structure was hence predicted using psi-pred. all α-helices, β-sheets and coiling were identified with their confidence scores in the predicted structure . the query sequence was threaded through pdb library using lomets after the prediction of secondary structure by psi-pred. initially to obtain the best performance from the ten state-of-art treading programs in lomets, top ten models were elected from each program solely based on sequence identity coverage and combined energy z-score values . fold 2vgda, the top ranked threading fold was identified by three individual threading programs in lomets with 66 % sequence identity of the templates in the threading alignment region with the query sequence. the threading folds were considered based on the z-scores. more the z-score value, more the significance level of the predicted structure. as it’s evident from the table  <dig> that many folds have z-score values, for instance 3zsea  or 1xnda  have more than the z-score value of 2vgda which creates ambiguity to predict the true positive structural fold of the protein. hence, to identify the false positive matches and highlight true positive folds, another programming template modeling align  was performed. the result of this structural alignment was ranked according to the tm-score . fold 2vgda was thus identified and ranked in the first order . hence, 2vgda was identified as the possible native structure of the query sequence.fig.  <dig> secondary structure of xylanase predicted by psi-pred. red alpha helix (); blue beta sheet () and black coil  whereas conf. score is the confidence score of each amino acid ranging from  <dig> to 9

prediction of 3d structure
five top ranking 3d models were generated by the i-tasser server by employing the top ten threading folds as the native structures . each model was validated based on c-score , tm-score, rmsd  and cluster density. the model  <dig> had the highest c-score  value reflecting a model of better validation with the structural similarity between the predicted model and the native structure .fig.  <dig> a top five 3d models of the xylanase predicted by i-tasser. highest rank is marked by the lowest number of model  by i-tasser where as the highest number denotes the lowest ranking . the ranking of the model was predicted by quality of the model which again was determined on the basis of c-score, tm-score and rmsd. the c-scores of the models were determined based on the z-score and the convergences of i-tasser simulations as depicted in table  <dig>  b final cartoon structure of xylanase as derived from model  <dig> as shown in fig. 5a. the substrate binding sites are asn- <dig>  try- <dig>  tyr- <dig> and tyr-217



prediction of ec number and ligand binding site
model  <dig> which has the highest c-score  was then analyzed by some benchmarking tests on the i-tasser server for potential enzyme analogs prediction. the analysis showed that the model  <dig> predicted by i-tasser matched with five enzyme analogs, all of which exhibited identical ec nos.:  <dig> . <dig>   whereas the ec-scores  of those analogs differed. highest ec-score was recorded in the pdb hit 2vgda was  <dig>  whereas the lowest was  <dig>  for pdb hits 1hixb and 1te1b. as per expasy enzyme database, the name of the protein analog 2vgda is endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase whose biological function is endohydrolysis of  <dig> -beta-d-xylosidic linkages in xylan. the ligand binding sites of the query protein were predicted using i-tasser for further verification of protein function. this is based on determination of binding site scores  which depend on the structural similarity and local sequence between the query structure and the binding sites of the templates. based on the bs-score  residues asn- <dig>  tyr- <dig>  tyr- <dig> and tyr- <dig> were identified as the active binding residues of the query protein .table  <dig> prediction of functional analogs of model  <dig> based on the enzyme classification  score. ec-score is the confidence score for the ec number prediction determined using global and local structural alignment program. ec-score value range in between  <dig> and  <dig>  higher the ec-score, higher the confidence of ec number prediction



biochemical characterization of purified xylanase
effect of ph on xylanase activity
the enzyme activity is greatly affected by ph. for the substrate binding and catalysis depend on charge distribution of both substrate and the enzyme molecules. the reaction phs were adjusted to  <dig> – <dig>  with various buffers as described above. xylanase was active over wide range of ph values from  <dig> – <dig>  with an optimum ph of  <dig> ; the optimal acetate buffer ph was  <dig>  and retained more than 90 % of its activity .fig.  <dig> 
a effect of ph on activity  and stability  of xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus r <dig>  the effect of ph on xylanase activity was determined at 370c for 30 min. where as the stability at 370c after incubation for 1 h in various buffers. buffers used: citrate , acetate , sodium-phosphate , tris , glycine-naoh  and carbonate-bicarbonate  . b optimal temperature  and thermal stability  of xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus r <dig>  the temperature profile was measured at different temperatures using optimum ph  <dig> , 50 mm acetate buffer. for thermal stability, the enzyme was incubated at different temperatures  in acetate buffer  for 1 h. 



effect of ph on xylanase stability
the stability of the purified xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> was determined at  <dig> 0c for 1 h when tested over a wide ph range of  <dig> – <dig>  . the xylanase was found to be highly stable at ph values of  <dig>  and  <dig> . the enzyme retained 70 % of its activity at ph  <dig>  for 1 h at 370c.

optimum temperature for xylanase activity
the xylanase was active over a broad temperature range of 40– <dig> 0c and showed its optimal temperature at 500c .

thermal stability of xylanase
the enzyme was found to be more stable at temperature below 500c. the enzyme retained about 40 % of its activity at 600c after 30 min of incubation . thermal stability of the enzyme is considered to be one of the significant characteristics in the industry; the thermostability of the enzyme can be increased by different methods like addition of metal ions or by protein engineering.

determination of kinetic parameters
km is the michaelis constant, can be found by measuring the substrate concentration when half the max velocity is achieved. km is a constant that remains same for a given set of enzyme and substrate. therefore, low km increases the affinity of enzyme with the substrate. the rate dependence of the enzyme reaction on different birchwood xylan concentrations at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> 0c followed michaelis-menten reaction kinetics. reciprocal plots  displayed apparent km and vmax values of  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig>  in this study, the purified enzyme showed significantly low km towards birchwood xylan.fig.  <dig> lineweaver-burk plot of initial velocity data for xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus r <dig>  the xylanase activity was determined in 50 mm acetate buffer ph  <dig>  at  <dig> 0c. symbols: v

discussion
in spite of advanced knowledge of microbial xylanases in the past decades, several terms are still significantly considered for choosing a microorganism for the production of xylanases. pulping industries require cost effective ways to produce xylanases which must have significant biochemical characteristics to withstand the hostile catalytic conditions. agricultural residues serve as the prominent source of hemicelluloses which are both environment friendly and cost effective. in the present study, the xylanase has been produced using agricultural residue  as the only source of carbon from aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> which yielded 208u/ml of xylanase in 96 h of incubation. aspergillus species have been the target organisms for the production of xylanases mainly because of the production capacity using the submerged fermentation as compared to the bacteria where the xylanase production is found to be low  <cit> . xylanase production has been reported from many aspergillus species. the xylanase activities of aspergillus fumigatus z <dig>  <cit>  and aspergillus fumigatus ma <dig>  <cit>  had been found to be  <dig> u/ml and  <dig> u/ml respectively whereas the xylanase activity of aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> was reported to be 208u/ml in 96 h of incubation. thus, xylanase production by aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> is found to be energy efficient and less time consuming which is an important criterion for selection of strain in industry for cost-effective production.

for in silico studies of the purified xylanase, the protein sequence containing  <dig> amino acids obtained after mass-spectrometry was analyzed by using the i-tasser server  <cit> . i-tasser protein structural modelling is based on the programme known as secondary structure enhanced profile-profile threading alignment. secondary structure of the target protein was predicted by employing the i-tasser and then a 3d structural model of the target protein indicating substrate binding residues was constructed. nuclear membrane resonance  and/or protein crystallography have been used to construct 3d structural model of the target protein  <cit>  but these techniques are more laborious, expensive and time consuming whereas, bioinformatics analyses offer comparatively less laborious, inexpensive and relatively faster experimentation. however, there are some shortcomings in these analyses; for instance, it is inevitably difficult to select most appropriate candidate when several variable parameters are to be considered in determination of structural models. in the current study, the threading fold 2vgda  was selected as a native structure for further analysis of structural modelling  where the other folds 3zsea and 1xnda shown higher z-score values . in this particular case the decision making factors were the sequence identities . thus, there is no problem in selection of a model when all required parameters are significantly higher. in this experiment, model  <dig> was selected as the top ranked model by i-tasser which was based on the highest confidence score  which was further validated by highest tm-score  and rmsd . therefore, this model was selected for further studies. hence, in the in silico studies the final model of purified xylanase predicted consists of residues asn- <dig>  tyr- <dig>  tyr- <dig> and tyr- <dig> which were identified as the active binding residues of the query protein.

xylanase from aspergillus ficuum af- <dig> had optimum ph of  <dig>  which retained 50 % and 30 % of its relative activities at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the optimum ph of purified xylanase from a. fumigatus r <dig> is found to be close to other species of aspergillus such as a. kawachii ph  <dig>   <cit> , a. nidulans ph  <dig>   <cit> , a. foetidus ph  <dig>   <cit> . the change in behaviour of the enzyme at ph  <dig> and  <dig> may be due to change in the composition of the buffer. the ph stability of xylanase between ph  <dig> – <dig>   has been reported from other aspergillus species such as a. carneus m <dig>  <cit>  and xylanase stability at ph  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>   has also been investigated from different genera such as streptomyces olivaceoviridis e- <dig>  <cit>  and streptomyces olivaceoviridis a <dig>  <cit>  respectively. thus, stability of the purified xylanase at broad ph range, especially to alkaline conditions is significant characteristic for applications in industry.

the optimum temperature of xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> was found to be similar to the xylanase from aspergillus fumigatus ma <dig>  <cit>  which showed optimal temperature of 500c. the optimal temperature of purified xylanase from various strains of aspergillus species is different such as a. versicolor   <cit> , a. caespitosus   <cit> , a. ficuum af- <dig>   <cit>  and penicillium species such as penicillium occitanis pol <dig>   <cit> . the temperature stability of xylanase in the current study is similar to another xylanase from penicillium occitanis pol <dig>  <cit>  which retained 50 % of its activity at 600c after 1 h incubation. however, incubation at higher temperature decreased the xylanolytic activity. at 700c, it lost 28 % of its activity in 30 min.

kinetic parameter analysis of purified xylanase from a. fumigatus r <dig> showed that it had a km of  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and vmax of  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig>  bakira et al.  <cit>  studied the kinetic parameter of xylanase from rhizopus oryzae and showed that km value for xylanase towards birchwood xylan was  <dig>  mg ml− <dig>  the km value of xylanase from a. fumigatus r <dig> was found to be similar to the km value of xylanase from streptomyces cyaneus sn  <dig>  <cit>  which was found to be  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> towards birchwood xylan. the km values of xylanase ii from a. sydowii sbs  <dig>  <cit>  towards birchwood xylan and oat spelt xylan were reported to be  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> respectively whereas the vmax of xylanase ii for birchwood xylan and oat spelt xylan was found to be 1587 μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> and 2381 μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> respectively. penicillium occitanis pol <dig>  <cit>  showed km of  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and vmax of  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we show that xylanase produced by aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> under submerged fermentation is novel enzyme. the xylanase was analyzed by mass-spectrometry, which indicated that the xylanase under study has never been reported earlier. the purified xylanase showed acidic optimum ph and broad range of ph stability mainly in the alkaline region. these characteristics coupled with the xylanase production using agricultural residue as the only source of carbon make the enzyme suitable for many applications, especially in food industry and a probable alternative to the use of chemicals in bioleaching in paper and pulp industries. taken together, we propose that the 3d model of xylanase established could be used for rational design of xylanase-specific inhibitors and to further understand the role of each fold of this protein to determine its function. moreover, the predicted 3d structural model can be used as a basal structure for obtaining point mutation to improve the catalytic efficiency of this protein and may be to increase thermostability.
