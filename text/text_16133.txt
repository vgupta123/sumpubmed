BACKGROUND
naegleria is a common genus of soil and freshwater free-living amoeba of the vahlkampfiid family  <cit> . naegleria apparently lack a sexual reproduction cycle since meiosis never has been observed or proven experimentally. subsequently, a number of genetically-defined variants have been isolated in nature and proposed as distinct species  <cit> . a typical naegleria amoeba cell contains a distinct nucleus with a large and predominant nucleolus containing as much as 3000– <dig> copies of an approximately 14-kb ribosomal dna  plasmid  <cit> . each rdna molecule carries a single transcription unit for the ribosomal rna  genes. some naegleria isolates have been reported to contain group i intron insertions at conserved sequence sites, both within the small subunit  and large subunit  rrna genes  <cit> . introns have been noted at position  <dig> in ssu rdna  and at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in lsu rdna  <cit> .

group i introns are autocatalytic genetic elements carrying a ribozyme domain responsible for the intron self-splicing reaction, and occasionally a homing endonuclease gene  encoding an endonuclease protein directly involved in intron mobility at the dna level  <cit> . a group i splicing ribozyme possess a well-defined three-dimensional structure organized into three functional domains  by approximately ten paired rna segments named p1–p <dig>  <cit> . the most common and best characterized of the naegleria rdna introns is nae.s <dig>  group i introns at position  <dig> in ssu rdna are relatively common among eukaryotic microorganisms with more than  <dig> cases reported so far  <cit> , and with both lateral and vertical inheritance patterns compared to that of host rdna. a widespread distribution and structural diversity among the s <dig> group i introns have been noted, including several complex introns carrying hegs  <cit> .

a typical naegleria s <dig> intron has a twin-ribozyme organization and represents the most complex class of all group i introns known  <cit> . nae.s <dig> consists of a small group i-like mrna capping ribozyme  and a heg domain, both inserted into the p6b segment of a regular group ic <dig> splicing ribozyme . expression and functional aspects of the naegleria s <dig> intron have been reported. the splicing ribozyme  is responsible for the autocatalytic activity that generates intron excision and exon ligation, as well as full-length intron rna circle formations  <cit> . the ability to form full-length intron rna circles is a general property of nuclear group i introns and could be important in rna mobility at the rna level, or even as an intermediate in the expression of the homing endonuclease  <cit> . the naegleria heg  encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein that belongs to the his-cys box family of homing endonucleases  <cit> . the intron endonuclease recognizes and binds to a 19-bp dna sequence flanking the s <dig> rdna site and cleaves the dna generating a five-nucleotide 3' staggered end  <cit> . in general, group i intron endonucleases promote intron homing at the dna-level by generating a double-stranded break in the intron-less target dna, followed by invasion of the donor intron-containing allele and dna repair using the intron-containing allele as template  <cit> . however, sexual mating is the biological framework for nuclear group i intron homing  <cit>  and it is unclear why the apparently asexual naegleria contains and maintains homing introns.

the expression of the naheg is dependent on a functional nagir <dig> ribozyme, which defines the 5' end of the homing endonuclease mrna by internal processing and modification of the excised nae.s <dig> intron  <cit> . primer extension analyses of both cellular rna from naegleria and in vitro transcribed intron rna  <cit>  are consistent with the formation of a tiny lariat cap structure between nucleotide  <dig> and  <dig> of the messenger, as recently reported in the related digir <dig> ribozyme  <cit> . thus, the nagir <dig> capping ribozyme represents a novel class of ribozymes possessing a new catalytic function, which is reflected in its unique rna architecture  <cit> .

the complex and unique structural organization of the naegleria twin-ribozyme intron makes it interesting to investigate the evolutionary origin of the different intron domains, as well as the inheritance pattern within the naegleria genus. here we report several new intron variants and have performed sequence and phylogenetic analyses providing new insight into fundamental questions such as intron structure, intron-host biology, and the origin and evolution of intron heg and ribozyme domains. the naegleria twin-ribozyme intron serves as an attractive model system in the characterization of evolutionary processes behind a recently gained, but vertically inherited, selfish genetic element.

RESULTS
widespread but sporadic distribution of nae.s <dig> introns within the naegleria genus
sequence analysis of its-rdna from  <dig> natural isolates of naegleria  was performed to gain insight into the genetic relationships among strains and species. a phylogenetic tree based on the nj method is presented in figure  <dig>  and corroborates previous finding of six main clusters of naegleria isolates  <cit> . most clusters appear monophyletic with high bootstrap and bayesian supports, and cluster  <dig> is the most prominent with  <dig> annotated naegleria isolates . a closer inspection of the ssu rrna identified intron sequences inserted at position s <dig> in  <dig> of  <dig> strains analyzed. all introns, except one  <cit> , belong to the highly complex twin-ribozyme group i intron family  <cit> . group i introns at position  <dig> in ssu rdna are relatively common among eukaryotic microorganisms  <cit> . interestingly, the naegleria  <dig> introns , show a widespread but scattered distribution among the naegleria isolates . all clusters, except the early diverging cluster  <dig>  <cit> , harbor isolates that carry the group i intron. furthermore, no linkages could be noted between the presence of the s <dig> intron and environmental factors such as optimal growth temperature, pathogenesis, habitats, and geographical origin of naegleria isolates.

structural features and sequence variability of intron domains
fourteen of the  <dig> introns were selected for more detail structural characterizations . all introns, but one , possess the twin-ribozyme group i intron organization previously reported  <cit> , and an updated rna consensus structure diagram is shown in figure  <dig>  the intron consists of three functional domains, identified as distinct intron structures. the autocatalytic naegleria splicing ribozyme  is responsible for intron excision and exon ligation during precursor rrna processing in the naegleria nucleolus, as well as for the generation of circular intron rnas  <cit> . nagir <dig> represents a typical group ic <dig> intron with clear structural resemblance to the well-studied tetrahymena ribozyme  <cit> . the consensus structure  is strongly supported by compensatory base substitutions among the naegleria introns. the most prominent differences between the naegleria and tetrahymena ribozymes are the lack of a p <dig>  segment in naegleria, the presence of an optional tetra-loop in l5b, and a large sequence insertion  in p6b harboring the homing endonuclease gene  and the capping ribozyme nagir <dig> .

nagir <dig> is a group i-like ribozyme with an evolved biological role in intron naheg expression  <cit> , likely to generate a lariat cap-structure at the 5' end of the naegleria homing endonuclease messenger  <cit> . the three-dimensional architecture of nagir <dig> is related to that of bacterial trna group i intron ribozymes  <cit> , but with a unique catalytic core organization that contains the novel pseudoknot segment p <dig>  <cit> . as seen from figure  <dig>  most of the core nucleotides are highly conserved among the various naegleria capping ribozymes. variable regions are almost exclusively located in the terminal loops of p <dig> and p <dig>  the internal loop junction j5/ <dig>  and sequences flanking nagir <dig> and naheg.

the third intron domain consists of the naheg which codes for a  <dig> amino acid  his-cys endonuclease that recognizes and cleaves the intron lacking allele sequence in rdna  <cit> . an alignment of the derived amino acid sequence from the studied naegleria introns is presented in figure  <dig>  the amino acid identities between pairs vary from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with the positive charged n-terminal region  as the most variable part. the n-terminal region contain arginine and lysine rich sequences that resembles known rna binding domains  <cit> , indicating that the naheg encodes a complex protein with both endonuclease and rna binding functions. all three intron domains at the rna-level  are possible targets for intron protein rna binding. both nagir <dig> and nagir <dig> are known to fold correctly and to be catalytically active in vitro without assistance of proteins  <cit> , suggesting no essential maturase function of the intron encoded protein. however, the intron protein could still be able to bind to it own messenger, which is predicted to be highly structured  <cit> . this possibility remains to be further experimentally explored. residues previously noted to be essential for endonuclease active site definition, catalysis, and zinc coordination   <cit>  are highly conserved. the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates  were calculated for the naheg sequences and found in all cases to be below one , indicating purifying selection. interestingly, the intron present in n. martinezi ng <dig> isolate contains hallmarks of a degenerated naheg, seen as multiple frame shifts and small indels .

the splicing ribozyme of nae.s <dig> intron is vertically inherited in naegleria
nagir <dig> represents the splicing-ribozyme domain of nae.s <dig> and thus corresponds to the sequences present in a prototype group i intron such as the tetrahymena intron. we have previously performed phylogenetic analysis of various nuclear s <dig> group i introns, including five nagir <dig> variants, and recognized the naegleria introns as a monophyletic clade among the group ic <dig> introns  <cit> . here we extend the analysis to include  <dig> nagir <dig> variants representing the different isolates of naegleria. furthermore, we also include a host rdna analysis based on their corresponding its-rdna sequences. the intron phylogeny was based on  <dig> sequence positions within nagir <dig>  strictly aligned according to the structure diagram in figure  <dig>  different methods  were used to build the phylogenetic trees, and all trees were essentially identically in topology. similarly, the its-rdna phylogeny was based on  <dig> sequence positions using the same set of tree building methods described above in intron analysis. figure  <dig> shows representative nj trees of both the its-rdna and nagir <dig> phylogenies with overall congruent branching patterns and significant bootstrap and bayesian supports. the only exception is n. italica ab-tf- <dig> , that could represent a recent horizontal intron transfer. however, the n. italica its-rdna branch topology is only poorly supported in nj analysis  and without bootstrap and bayesian supports in the mp, ml, and bay analyses, respectively. thus, we infer there are no experimental support of horizontal intron transfer and conclude that the nagir <dig> domain, representing the nae.s <dig> intron, is vertically inherited within the naegleria genus.

the capping ribozyme nagir <dig> and its downstream naheg are evolutionary linked
divergent evolutionary histories of group i splicing ribozymes and their hegs have been described in several nuclear group i introns  <cit> . the naegleria twin-ribozyme intron is highly unusual among group i introns in that it contains two distinct structural domains  inserted into the same peripheral region  of nagir <dig> . to address the relationships among the variants of nagir <dig> and naheg, as well as between the different intron domains  we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence alignments. figure  <dig> presents representative nj trees of nagir <dig> and naheg. the phylogenetic trees, built by the mp, ml, and bay methods, were essentially identical. the naheg tree was based on  <dig> aligned positions and possesses significant bootstrap and bayesian supports. the total size of the nagir <dig> domain is less than  <dig> nucleotides in size and thus only  <dig> positions could be included in the analysis. however, we found the tree topology to be well supported in bootstrap and posterior probability analyses. interestingly, the nagir <dig>  naheg, and nagir <dig>  phylogenies were found to have congruent branching topologies consistent with a co-evolutionary pattern of the domains within introns. but there is one clear exception in n. carteri ng <dig> , suggesting a homologous recombination-like event between natural sequence intron variants.

a naegleria s <dig> group i intron with only naheg or only nagir <dig> insertions has never been observed, suggesting a strong linkage between the domains. both structural and functional data give further support to a close linkage between the nagir <dig> and naheg domains. jabri and cech  <cit>  showed that the rna structure essential for nagir <dig> catalysis includes nucleotide residues within the naheg coding region. functional experiments in yeast conclude that expression of naheg, and subsequent endonuclease activity in yeast extracts, is completely dependent on a functional nagir <dig> ribozyme  <cit> . thus, the nagir <dig> and naheg domains have to be considered as one functional unit within the nae.s <dig> intron.

gain of a l5b gnra tetraloop in nagir <dig> during naegleria evolution
one of the best-studied tetraloop receptor interaction is the l5b-p6a tertiary structure in the tetrahymena group i intron ribozyme  <cit> . here, the gaaa loop in l5b specifically binds to the 11-nt receptor motif ccuaag-uaugg within the helical stem of p6a by docking into the shallow groove. the l5b-p6a interaction in tetrahymena is essential for an efficient folding of the p4–p <dig> domain, and subsequently the folding and activity of the splicing ribozyme.

two of the most variable parts in the naegleria gir <dig> splicing ribozyme are l5b and p6a . a closer inspection of the  <dig> twin-ribozyme intron sequences identify tetra-, penta-, and hexaloops in l5b of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> introns, respectively. all tetraloops belong to the gnra family  known to specifically interact with receptor sequences. to address the distribution pattern of the l5b tetraloops among the various naegleria intron isolates a phylogenetic analysis based on  <dig> positions, representing the complete twin-ribozyme introns, was performed. essential identical trees were obtained from the nj and mp methods, and a representative nj tree is shown in figure 6a. interestingly, introns harboring a l5b gnra tetraloop cluster together with high bootstrap support, suggesting that a l5b tetraloop was gained late the evolution of the naegleria genus. the only exception appears the l5b pentaloop of the n. philippinensis rjtm intron , but this example may represent a secondary loss of a gnra tetra-loop .

the primary function of gnra tetraloops is to participate in long-range rna-rna interactions by specific binding to a receptor motif. a variety of receptor motifs, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, have been recognized experimentally  <cit> . figure 6b presents secondary structure diagrams of the various nagir <dig> p6a regions and their corresponding l5b loops. a prominent difference in the p6a structure is noted among introns possessing l5b gnra tetraloops compared to those with penta- or hexaloops. introns with gnra loops contain a less tightly base-paired p6a stem with several proposed exposed residues  compared to the p5b penta- or hexaloop containing introns . we speculate that the exposed residues in p6a could be involved in rna-rna interactions as gnra receptors. however, these sequences do not fit any known consensus motifs, suggesting that new motifs are yet to be experimentally identified.

CONCLUSIONS
evolutionary aspects on the structural organization of naegleria twin-ribozyme group i introns have been reported previously  <cit> . whereas the nagir <dig> splicing ribozyme appears related to other eukaryote rdna group ic <dig> intron  <cit> , the nagir <dig> capping ribozyme has recently evolved from a bacterial trna group i introns  <cit> . here we present phylogenetic evidence of a vertical inheritance pattern of the nae.s <dig> intron in naegleria that includes each of the domains nagir <dig>  nagir <dig>  and naheg, and corroborates a previous study based on  <dig> intron sequences  <cit> . based on the reported distribution pattern and phylogeny, we propose the following vertical inheritance scenario for the nae.s <dig> evolution. 1) a pre-organized twin-ribozyme group i intron was gained in the rdna early in evolution of the naegleria genus, but after the cluster  <dig> branching . 2) once established, the naegleria intron co-evolved along with its host rdna by maintaining intron activities including intron splicing, endonuclease mrna capping, and homing endonuclease dna cleavage. 3) the intron was subsequently lost  by sporadic deletions in most isolates . 4) degradation of the naheg is initiated due to loss of biological function, and subsequent selection pressure , resulting in complete deletion of the naheg as well as its regulatory nagir <dig> capping ribozyme   <cit> . 5) the remaining introns have to improve and adjust their functions by continuous sequence evolution in order to be maintained within rdna. here, a recent gain of a gnra tetraloop receptor in the p4–p <dig> domain would facilitate folding of the splicing ribozyme .

what is the biological role of a functional naheg in naegleria s <dig> introns? there are only two reported examples addressing the biological role of nuclear group i intron hegs in experimental settings. in sexual matings between intron-containing and intron-lacking strains of either the myxomycetes physarum polycephalum or didymium iridis, group i introns were shown to be mobile due to the double-strand-break-repair pathway induced by intron-encoded homing endonucleases  <cit> . in both cases the homing endonucleases were found to cleave the group i intron lacing alleles in a highly sequence specific manner, resulting in unidirectional transfers of introns into the intron-lacking strains. this process is dependent on a sexual reproduction of the host organism, which is apparently absent in naegleria. however, the naegleria intron endonucleases possess hallmarks linked to a function in intron homing. first, sequence comparisons show that the naegleria enzymes belong to the same his-cys homing endonuclease family as the known homing endonucleases i-ppoi and i-diri encoded by the mobile physarum and didymium group i introns  <cit> . second, the naegleria endonucleases cleave only intron lacking alleles flanking the intron insertion site at the ssu rrna gene  <cit> . finally, artificial expression of the naegleria endonuclease and its intron in yeast generate intron homing intermediates consistent with a homing endonuclease function  <cit> . interestingly, naegleria may occasionally perform sexual reproduction in nature since pernin and co-workers  <cit>  reported evidence for genetic exchange in n. lovaniensis, including chromosomal recombination. both haploid and diploid strains of the n. gruberi neg isolate have been described based on both amoeba dna content and uv-sensitivity  <cit> . perhaps the observed recombination-like feature of nagir <dig> in n. carteri ng <dig>  is a result of rare sexual mating. this possibility remains to be experimentally explored.
