BACKGROUND
plants use different response and adaptive mechanisms to deal with abiotic water deficit stress . these include  avoidance of dehydration by closing stomata to decrease water loss and to maintain turgor or osmotic pressure;  drought escape by a rapid life cycle to cope with water deficit; and  dehydration tolerance and maintenance of growth and development under low-water status by accumulating protective proteins, sugars, proline, antioxidants, by maintaining cell membrane stability, and by interrupting metabolic activity through dormancy. abiotic stress response mechanisms in plants are linked to different physiological traits. depending on their molecular and physiological attributes, plants control their stomatal aperture and water balance in very different ways with important consequences for their transpiration, biomass gain and survival. accordingly, drought-tolerant plant ecotypes may have more flexible stomatal responses under drought conditions by sustaining longer periods of transpiration and co <dig> assimilation. they may therefore outperform plants with more sensitive stomatal responses under conditions of mild to moderate drought.

cultivated barley  is one of the most important global crops because it can be cultivated in highly diverse environments. wild barley  is the direct ancestor of cultivated barley and has a large geographical distribution ranging from deserts to highland climates  <cit> . throughout its geographical distribution, wild barley is exposed to multiple environmental stresses such as drought, high temperatures, and high soil salinity. the correlation of genetic and environmental variation within its distribution range suggests the action of local adaptation along macro- and micro-environmental gradients . it is therefore an excellent model system for studying plant adaptation and holds a high potential as a genetic resource for the breeding of stress tolerant varieties of cultivated barley  <cit> .

in barley, several traits characterize the differential response to drought stress, including grain carbon isotope discrimination  <cit> , leaf relative water content  <cit> , leaf osmotic potential and adjustment, and osmotic potential at full turgor  <cit> , water-soluble carbohydrate concentration  <cit>  and chlorophyll parameters   <cit> . these traits are correlated with morphological and phenological traits such as variation in seedling germination, flowering time, plant height and tillering, root growth and grain yield. some of them differ between desert and mediterranean wild barley ecotypes suggesting local adaptation . so far, over  <dig> quantitative trait loci  were found to be associated with drought stress responsive traits in cultivated barley . the complex nature of the trait and current shortcomings in qtl detection are responsible for the limited contribution of qtl studies to elucidate the genetic basis of drought tolerance and its utilization in plant breeding  <cit> . modern genomic approaches may lead to a more efficient use of genetic resources like wild barley to utilize drought stress tolerance genes for crop improvement.

the recent sequencing of the barley genome greatly facilitates the mapping and utilization of useful genetic variation  <cit> . the current genome assembly is based on five cultivated barley cultivars and one wild barley accession of the barley1k collection   <cit> , which resulted in  <dig>  'high-confidence’  barley genes and a total estimate of  <dig>  genes  <cit> . levels of genome-wide variation were high in both wild and cultivated barley, but with an almost two-fold higher level of genetic variation in wild than in cultivated barley. this suggests that much untapped and potentially useful genetic variation is segregating in wild barley  <cit> . re-sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and sequencing of epigenomic variation contributes to the functional annotation of complex plant genomes and to the identification of genes and alleles responsible for adaptive evolution in contrasting environments  <cit> .

to identify genes expressed under drought stress in differentially adapted wild barley accessions, we first validated the different physiological adaptation to drought stress of two wild barley ecotypes from a collection of hordeum spontaneum ecotypes   <cit>  and then performed  <dig> transcriptome sequencing of normalized cdna libraries from drought-stressed leaves of these two accessions because transcriptome sequencing allow the identification of novel genes and improve the annotation of the barley genome. the two sequenced ecotypes included a desert ecotype  from the negev desert, and a 'mediterranean’ ecotype  from the cooler and moister north-western region of israel. both genetic and phenotypic analyses strongly suggested that they are differentially adapted to heat and drought stress  <cit> . we identified numerous ecotype-specific genes, which may be involved in drought adaptation, and single nucleotide polymorphisms  that can be used to differentiate between adapted and non-adapted b1k ecotypes.

RESULTS
physiological characterization of wild barley plants
the b1k <dig> and the b1k <dig> accessions from the barley1k collection  <cit>  were selected based on previous studies for their difference in physiological responses to drought. the physiological measurements were conducted in greenhouses and plants were kept under natural light conditions and semi-controlled temperature and humidity . measured traits included mid-day whole-plant transpiration , weight gain and loss, which were normalized to the plant leaf area, water-use efficiency , and leaf relative content . unexpectedly, the desert ecotype lost more water than the mediterranean ecotype cultivar under both well-irrigated  and drought conditions . despite its higher transpiration rate, the desert cultivar maintained a higher rwc than the mediterranean ecotype under drought conditions . moreover, the ratio between the cumulative weight gain and cumulative transpiration of plants  revealed that the desert ecotype has a higher wue than the mediterranean ecotype with wue calculated as the ratio of rwc to transpiration rate, e . to identify candidate genes reflecting the differential response to drought stress, leaf samples from two plants of each ecotype were sampled for rna extraction at day  <dig> of the drought treatment .figure  <dig>

 <dig> sequencing and de novoassembly of the wild barley transcriptome
two cdna libraries of the drought-stressed wild barley accessions were sequenced with  <dig> sequencing technology. a summary of the raw sequence data is presented in table  <dig>  counts of raw reads and of the resulting unique transcripts were about the same in both libraries. after quality trimming, 99% of the reads had phred-like quality scores > <dig> and an average read length of 356 bp , 313 bp  and  <dig> . almost 95% of both b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> were included in separate and joint de novo assemblies . after clustering, we obtained three de novo assemblies with  <dig>  putative unique transcripts  for b1k <dig>   <dig>  for b1k <dig> and  <dig>  for b1k  that included isotigs and true singletons. length distributions of the isotigs or puts in all three assemblies are given in table  <dig>  which shows that a joint assembly of the b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> libraries into a single assembly did not significantly increase average isotig length. there is also a strong positive correlation between the number of reads per isotig and the length of the isotig , which affects the quality of subsequent functional and evolutionary analyses as presented below.table  <dig>

reference-based mapping of  <dig> sequences and snp identification
in addition to the de novo assembly, we also employed a reference-based mapping approach. with this method, 94% of the b1k <dig> reads could be mapped against the b1k <dig> unique transcripts . over 75% of the reads were mapped onto the cultivated barley full length cdna  sequences and about 65% against the coding sequences  of the high-confidence  cultivated barley genes. a substantial proportion of reads mapped to more than one target . nearly all reads  mapped against the morex whole-genome shotgun sequence, although the number of reads mapped at several locations was two-fold higher than reads mapped only once.table  <dig>

identification of wild barley-specific transcripts
one goal of this study was to identify transcripts that are unique to wild barley. all puts were compared to each other with blast to identify the proportion of homologous puts shared among the two divergent wild barley ecotypes. the two divergent ecotypes shared about  <dig>   of the puts from both ecotypes or 46% of b1k <dig> puts . hence, the majority of the transcripts were restricted to one of the two ecotypes. the mean length of shared transcripts among ecotypes  was significantly larger  than ecotype-specific transcripts . the proportion of shared puts increased to  <dig> and 84% for transcripts longer than  <dig> and  <dig>  bp, respectively. this suggests either that ecotype-specific transcripts are shorter or that the power to identify orthologs in the other ecotype depends on transcript length.

we further compared the wild barley transcripts with cultivated barley genes using a reciprocal blast hit  approach to identify putative orthologs . a total of 82%  of b1k <dig> and 81%  of b1k <dig> transcripts were orthologous to at least one of three cultivated barley sequence datasets. a proportion of 16%  of b1k <dig> and 17%  of b1k <dig> transcripts did not have a significant rbh in the other wild barley ecotype and the cultivated barley data. they can be considered as candidate ecotype-specific genes. only a small proportion of 2% of transcripts matched the other ecotype but not cultivated barley. among the combined b1k puts, 25%  did not match to cultivated barley. these results suggest that b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> are highly divergent ecotypes and that a significant proportion of wild barley transcripts are not homologous to currently known genes from the cultivated barley genome. since this proportion may be influenced by variation in transcript length due to incompletely sequenced cdnas , we asked whether transcript length is correlated with the proportion of reciprocal blast hits to cultivated barley using puts from the joint assembly . the proportion of orthologous hits to cultivated barley increased with sequence length from  <dig> % for sequences of 100–250 bp length to  <dig> % with sequences ≥ <dig>  bp length . the mean length of ecotype-specific puts was significantly shorter than of those occurring in both ecotypes . the same pattern was observed among joint assembly puts with  and without  a hit to cultivated barley . therefore, sequence length variation needs to be considered in the identification of transcripts specific to wild barley. on the other hand,  <dig> out of  <dig>   long wild barley  transcripts  currently have no orthologs in cultivated barley sequence data suggesting they are good candidates wild barley-specific genes.table  <dig>

the orthologous analysis was based on rbh.



conservation of unique transcripts in evolutionary distant plant species
to estimate how many wild barley transcripts are conserved in more distant plant species, we compared them against five fully sequenced and annotated plant genomes of variable evolutionary distance to barley: brachypodium, rice, sorghum, maize and arabidopsis. based on the rbh approach with an e-value ≤1e- <dig>  ≥75% identity and alignment length of ≥ <dig> amino acids as cutoffs, the highest proportion of orthologous genes was observed between wild barley and brachypodium, followed by rice, sorghum, maize and arabidopsis, in decreasing order , which reflects the evolutionary distance of these species to barley. a total of 13%  long  unique transcripts from the b1k assembly for which no ortholog was found in barley hc genes and fl-cdna were homologous to other grass species. we also investigated which proportion of ecotype- and wild barley-specific transcripts are conserved across fully sequenced and annotated grass genomes. based on rbh, 98% each of ecotype-specific  and wild barley-specific  transcripts have no orthologs in brachypodium, rice and sorghum. the results indicate that a significant proportion of putative unique ecotype- and wild barley-specific transcripts are not conserved in closely related grass species .

annotation with go terms and kegg pathways
all wild barley transcripts were annotated based on homology searches in the non-redundant ncbi protein , swiss-prot/uniprot, kegg and interpro/pfam databases using blastx. the results are summarized in table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s3a. proportions of significant hits ranged from 40%  to 67%  for b1k <dig> puts, and from 37%  to 63%  for b1k <dig> puts. the majority of unique transcripts  longer than 500 bp showed significant blastx hits in the nr database, whereas the majority of puts without blastx hits in the nr database  were shorter than 500 bp . therefore, transcript length affects the functional annotation by homology search because shorter transcripts may have a lower chance of a blast hit or are incomplete cdnas without a protein-coding region.

we used blast2go to assign gene ontology  terms to protein-coding unique transcripts . in both ecotypes, the majority of go terms describe molecular function , followed by cellular component  and biological process . among molecular function terms, the majority of transcripts was annotated with 'binding’  and 'catalytic activity’ . among biological process terms, most transcripts were annotated with the terms 'metabolic process’ , 'cellular process’  and 'response to stimulus’ . the proportion of genes annotated with these terms was essentially identical for the b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> transcripts.

identification of stress-related genes and transcription factors
to identify unique transcripts that are orthologous to previously annotated stress-related genes and transcription factors , we used a stringent blastx search measuring parameters combined with a rbh approach. based on the list of candidate genes described in materials and methods, we found  <dig> stress-associated transcripts both in b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> unique transcripts, of which seven were found in b1k <dig>   <dig> only in b1k <dig> and  <dig> in both ecotypes . the majority of unique transcripts were homologous to heat shock proteins followed by aquaporin and erd genes from different grasses; lea and abc transporter genes were also detected. to further identify wild barley putative transcripts involved in stress response, the literature was searched for functional genes, transcription factors and enzymes that regulate abiotic stress tolerance in different plants. wild barley transcripts orthologous to these identified stress-responsive genes, transcription factors and enzymes were identified in the go, kegg and protein domain  annotation results. we obtained  <dig> b1k <dig> and  <dig> b1k <dig> unique transcripts associated with more than  <dig> different stress-responsive genes . most transcripts matched to zinc-finger domain containing genes , abc transporters , and heat shock proteins . likewise,  <dig> transcripts in b1k <dig> and  <dig> in b1k <dig> could be assigned to  <dig> different transcription factors responsible for abiotic stress tolerance.

since response of drought tolerance is regulated by tfs, we used the rbh approach to find orthologous of known barley tfs among wild barley puts. we identified  <dig>  known barley tfs orthologous to  <dig> b1k <dig> and  <dig> b1k <dig> unique transcripts and  <dig> tfs from arabidopsis thaliana and five grasses  that were homologous to  <dig> b1k <dig> and  <dig> b1k <dig> unique transcripts .

gene prediction based on barley hc genes
to evaluate the use of wild barley transcriptome sequences for improving the cultivated barley genome annotation, we first investigated how many barley hc genes were fully and partially covered by our unique transcripts. we achieved this by predicting the extent of coding sequence  covered by the unique transcripts using blastx . 62% of b1k puts tagged 45% of barley hc genes, and 5% of b1k puts homologous to barley hc genes fully covered hc genes. the majority of shorter hc genes  were well covered by puts while the longer hc genes were less covered . a higher proportion of longer than shorter hc genes has a hit with wild barley puts .figure  <dig>

in addition, we used orfpredictor to predict cds . over 99% of the unique transcripts from all three assemblies consist cds longer than  <dig> nucleotides with an average predicted cds length of 350 bp ; 19% were longer than 500 bp and 4% were longer than 1 kb.  <dig> %  of the predicted cds from b1k puts had the same cds length as their orthologous hc cds, while  <dig> %  were longer than their orthologs . we also analysed the proportion of novel transcripts annotated with cds. almost all  of them were annotated with cds ≥33 bp and 85% with cds ≥200 bp . the results indicate that ab initio prediction of cds identifies a substantial number of transcripts that differ from annotated orthologous barley genes and may contribute to an improved annotation .

snp discovery in transcriptome data
we searched for snps in the transcriptome sequences to differentiate the two wild barley ecotypes. as a first step, we compared three snp calling tools  by analyzing b1k <dig> reads aligned onto hv. fl-cdna. after a very stringent filtering, a total of  <dig>  snps were identified, of which 53%  were unique to a single tool, while 47%  were identified by more than one tool . snp numbers differed ten-fold between tools, and only  <dig> %  were identified by all three tools . under the assumption that snps identified by at least two tools are likely true snps, bowtie- <dig> appears to be the most accurate snp caller. we identified  <dig>  high quality snps from  <dig>  raw snps between the two wild barley ecotypes  with bowtie- <dig> and stringent snp filtering criteria. this corresponds to a frequency of  <dig>  snps per 1 kb . snp counts identified by using the cultivated barley sequences as reference are shown in table  <dig>  the b1k set produced a proportionally larger number of filtered snps than the b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> libraries alone, which reflect the sum of both accessions as well as the higher coverage per nucleotide position in the combined dataset . we also compared how snps identified from desert b1k <dig> and mediterranean b1k <dig> ecotypes overlap with snps discovered from wild barley ecotype b1k <dig> , which belongs to the same barley1k collection and was shotgun sequenced at low coverage  <cit> . a quarter of snps identified in each ecotype  overlapped with snps identified in b1k <dig>  using a different sequencing approach. this overlap suggests that a significant proportion of snps in the transcriptome sequence data are correctly inferred.figure  <dig>

snp annotation
in the b1k set,  <dig>  snps were identified from  <dig>  raw snps after filtering in the b1k set. the top three snp categories were snps in 3′ untranslated regions , synonymous snp , and non-synonymous snp . other  type of snps included intronic and intergenic snps, possibly because of unprocessed mrnas in the libraries . the high proportion of 3′-utr snps likely resulted from abias towards the 3′-end of transcripts due to the cdna library construction method  <cit> . in both ecotypes, the proportion of ssnp in genic and cds/exon regions was over 2-fold higher than the proportion of nssnp . the average number of nssnp in the genic regions was by 2-fold higher in the desert ecotype b1k <dig> than in the mediterranean ecotype b1k <dig>  similarly, other snp types with strong functional effects  were 2-fold more frequent in b1k <dig> than in b1k <dig> . the average proportion of nssnp/ssnp ratios was higher in stress-related genes of both ecotypes  than the average proportion across all genes . some of these genes belong to highly conserved protein families such as heat shock/chaperone, aquaporin, bzip, myb, chlorophyll a-b binding and photosystem ii  chlorophyll apoproteins suggesting that these gene classes be involved in adaptive evolution. the chromosomal distribution of nssnps is shown in figure 4b, the distribution and proportion of ssnp and nssnp in selected barley genes is further summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  and  <dig> barley genes with the largest numbers of putatively function-affecting snps are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> table  <dig>

estimation of the population recombination parameter
we estimated the population recombination parameter ρ =4ner from three wild barley ecotypes  using  <dig>  snps, and found an average value of  <dig>  ρ/kb ± <dig>  . it varies between chromosomes with the highest and lowest rates in chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the recombination rates on the remaining chromosomes were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . nonetheless, the recombination rate per kb does not differ between chromosomes . high recombination rates were observed in telomeric regions of each chromosome . there is no significant correlation  between snp density and the population recombination parameter .

discussion
phenotypic response to drought stress in wild barley
wild barley ecotypes from the divergent mediterranean and desert climates are phenotypically different in several quantitative traits  <cit> . recent work has corroborated this finding by genomic and phenotypic analyses  <cit> . furthermore, drought stress tolerance in barley likely appears to be linked to wue because wild barley genotypes from contrasting environments and with different wue differed in their level of drought stress tolerance  <cit> . this study led to the discovery of the barley dehydration-responsive hsdr <dig> gene, which is more strongly expressed in drought-tolerant than sensitive genotypes. the physiological responses in the present study are consistent with these results and contribute to the list of ecologically relevant phenotypic differences between mediterranean and desert barley that may reflect differential adaptation. although the desert ecotype showed a higher absolute water loss, its wue and rwc were significantly larger under drought conditions. in contrast to our results, eppel et al.
 <cit>  observed a similar decrease of wue under drought stress in both mediterranean and desert wild barley ecotypes, whereas other physiological traits such as photosystem ii yield and non-photochemical quenching  differed significantly between both ecotypes. currently, no studies are available that investigated the relationship between plant fitness in dry environments and wue or rwc in wild barley. wue was positively correlated with differential fitness in boechera stricta
 <cit> , suggesting a contribution to fitness, but this was not observed in the desert annual helianthus anomalus
 <cit> 
. taken together, these contrasting results highlight the complex nature of the trait. future studies will have to investigate the genetic relationship between fitness and physiological traits in differentially adapted wild barley using, for example, segregating populations derived from crosses between differentially adapted parental lines or accessions.

sequencing and assembly of wild barley transcriptome
the sequencing of normalized cdna libraries resulted in more than half million reads per library of which almost 95% of high-quality trimmed reads could be de novo assembled into putative unique contigs. this high proportion of assembled reads is similar to other studies utilizing  <dig> transcriptome sequencing in species with complex genomes such as douglas-fir  <cit> , and significantly higher than in other studies  <cit> . the unique transcripts length increased with the number of assembled reads per transcripts, in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . the present study with an average contig length of 609 bp and a n <dig> value of 910 bp in the b1k assembly is significantly larger than in a previous  <dig> transcriptome analysis of cultivated barley with a mean contig size of 505 bp and n <dig> values of 531 bp  <cit> , or in a similar survey in two grass species of the genus spartina
 <cit> . the numbers of assembled unique transcripts in each ecotype are quite close to the  <dig>  barley hc genes, and the number of putative unique transcripts from the combined b1k assembly is even higher. the full-length transcript data from cultivated barley  originate from complete genome sequencing efforts  <cit>  that involved several sequencing runs using different sequencing approaches and were therefore not comparable with transcripts obtained in a single  <dig> run. in the present study the libraries were made from leaf tissue only. we therefore expect that a significant proportion of barley genes may not have been captured, since only 72-84% of barley hc genes were expressed in more than one developmental stage or tissue  <cit> .

because no reference genome for h. spontaneum was available, we used the hv. fl-cdna, hv. hc cds and the currently released barley genome as references for read mapping and snp discovery. when mapped against the full-length cdna, over three-fourth  of both b1k <dig> and b1k <dig> non-redundant reads were mapped; whereas only around two-third were mapped against hv. hc genes, and about 80% onto chromosomal genomic sequences. within wild barley, the majority  of b1k <dig> non-redundant reads were mapped onto the b1k <dig> transcriptome from de novo assembly. a substantial proportion of reads were mapped to many sites of the reference sequences: 41% reads in mapping among ecotypes and up to 47% reads in mapping of ecotype onto wgs. similar results have been reported for chickpea   <cit>  and maize   <cit> . the presence of paralogous genes and isoforms from splice variants, and quality of the reference sequences could contribute to the observed duplicate mapping  and some  <dig> reads mapping to multiple sites may represent transcribed transposable elements.

identification of new barley genes by transcriptome sequencing
since the cdna libraries were normalized, a significant proportion of rare transcripts should have been sequenced with higher probability than non-normalized libraries and contributed to the discovery of novel transcripts and genetic variants  <cit> . the homology searches against all three current barley databases, barley hc genes, hv. fl-cdna and harvest, supported this expectation because a substantial proportion of the unique transcripts  has not been annotated as genes in cultivated barley, although 98% of the reads were mapped onto the cultivated barley genome. furthermore, the majority of new transcripts from both ecotypes did not show significant blast hits in closely related grass species  and protein databases . on the other hand, 85% of new or novel transcripts were annotated with a coding sequence length longer than 100 bp. although these results look unexpected, similar results were reported in cultivated barley  <cit>  with 40% new contigs, as well as in wheat  <cit> , the grass spartina
 <cit>  and the zebra finch  <cit> . since all of these studies employed  <dig> sequencing of normalized cdna libraries, it appears to be an efficient approach for the discovery of new genes. the total number of barley genes was estimated to be around  <dig> , and  <dig>   of them are reported as high-confidence  genes  <cit> . the discrepancy between the high proportion of reads mapped to the h. vulgare genome and the large number of novel transcripts specific to wild barley found in our data may be explained as follows:  the novel transcripts represent genes that are present in wild but not in cultivated barley, or  are present but have not yet been identified in cultivated barley because the 'morex’ wgs data, to which 98% the raw  <dig> reads could be mapped, still represent a draft genome assembly;  the novel transcripts may be derived from genes with structural variants and alternative splicing. the local alignment approach used to map 98% of the reads against the wgs data 'soft-trimmed’ the read end, which leads to a high proportion of aligned reads by removing non-matching ends. it has been shown before that such trimmed reads are associated with structural variants and alternative splicing, both of which are highly prevalent in barley  <cit> ;  novel transcripts without any homology may represent poorly conserved non-coding rnas   <cit>  or untranslated regions  of the genome because they originated from incompletely transcribed or sequenced mrnas and may be too short to generate significant blast hits.

based on the rbh analysis, our assemblies represent 41-47% orthologs of the current set of  <dig>  barley hc genes. a comparison of our go annotation with the barley affymetrix go terms  <cit>  showed a similar distribution suggesting that our transcripts well represent wild barley genes. known barley genes not present in the transcriptome data may have been lost or not sampled during library preparation or sequencing. alternatively, they may not be expressed in wild barley leaf under drought stress, or may show low expression or expression at different developmental stages or plant tissues, since only 72-84% of the hc genes were expressed in all developmental stages or tissue samples  <cit> .

the unique transcripts generated from the differentially adapted wild barley ecotypes contribute to an improved annotation of the barley genome. this is because many puts identified in this study are not orthologous to barley hc genes and/or fl-cdna, but some of these non-orthologous transcripts are conserved in grasses and other plant species. a significant number of cds in our transcript set are longer than their orthologous barley hc genes, indicating that some of the annotated barley genes are not complete or differentially spliced.

a substantial proportion of puts are not shared between the two wild barley ecotypes. they may  represent genes whose transcripts were lost during cdna normalization or library preparation,  presence/absence polymorphisms, i.e., ecotype-specific or non-shared transcripts that reflect genome divergence due to differential loss or gain of transcripts, as has been documented in maize , or  differential expression of genes in both accessions in response to the drought treatment. since we sequenced normalized cdna libraries and did not include untreated plants, our data do not allow us to differentiate between presence/absence polymorphisms and differential expression. genome re-sequencing using targeted exome capture and rnaseq of treated and untreated plants will reveal why transcripts are not shared between the two ecotypes.

identification of candidate stress-related genes and transcription factors
studies in different model organisms such as rice and arabidopsis thaliana uncovered numerous genes encoding transcription factors, signal transduction and transporter proteins with well characterized roles in drought stress regulation  <cit> . transcriptome sequences generated from ecotypes adapted to different environments can be used to identify homologs of known stress-related genes in non-model organisms. using rbh- and keywords-based searches, we identified more than  <dig> genes with known stress-related genes from other species in each accession. genes encoding zinc-finger proteins, abc transporters, heat shock proteins and transcription factors  were the most abundant types of stress-related genes. as an example, the abc subfamily g  transporter significantly contributes to leaf water retention in wild barley and rice  <cit> . some of these transcription factors, for instance, bzip, bhlh and myb are found to be regulating different stress responses in plants  <cit> . as discussed above, the presence of different homologs to known stress-related genes in the two ecotypes does not necessarily mean that they are involved in drought-response or indicative of the genetic divergence between the two ecotypes, but are putative candidates for further evolutionary or functional investigations. for instance, the barley dehydration-responsive hsdr <dig> gene, which encodes a rho-gtpase-activating protein and is highly expressed in drought tolerant relative to sensitive genotypes under drought stress  <cit>  is also present in the puts identified in this study. in previous studies, snps were only found in the intron and promoter regions of tolerant and sensitive genotypes, but the comparison of puts and hsdr <dig> identified six new snps in the coding region.

snp discovery in transcriptome sequences
despite the great power of current sequencing technologies, snp identification is still challenging and affected by several factors  <cit> . we found ten-fold different numbers of snps between snp callers indicating that snp calling strongly depends the particular algorithm  <cit> . early snp calling methods such as gsmapper that use fixed cutoff rules tend to underestimate snp numbers when compared to probabilistic methods as implemented in bowtie  <cit> . probabilistic methods also depend on parameter settings because numbers of snps identified with bowtie  <dig> differed by  <dig> -fold between local and end-to-end methods. one solution to this is the use of several tools because snps discovered by two or more programs are more likely true snps than those predicted by one only  <cit>  and snps called at higher coverage most likely represent true snps  <cit> .

we identified over one thousand snps in wild barley, resulting in  <dig>  snps per kb at high coverage. this is similar to a recent survey of wild barley collected across israel   <cit> . we also identified over one thousand snps by mapping against the cultivated barley sequences . a quarter of snps from each ecotype are shared with snps identified from wild barley ecotype b1k <dig> used for barley genome sequencing  <cit> , which independently confirms a significant proportion of discovered snps. based on the comparisons of each ecotype against all three cultivated barley datasets, the snp density of the desert ecotype b1k <dig> against cultivated barley is  <dig> -fold higher than of the mediterranean ecotype b1k <dig>  which was calculated as the mean of the snp densities of  <dig> -fold to fl-cdna,  <dig> -fold to hc and  <dig> -fold to the chromosomal genome sequences. there is more genetic variation in the desert barley and a higher genetic similarity between mediterranean wild barley and cultivated barley suggesting that  the cultivated barley domestication occurred in the northern part of israel,  there is gene flow among cultivated and mediterranean ecotypes, and/or  the desert ecotypes diverged more because of the accumulation of adaptive and linked neutral variation through adaptive evolution to the desert conditions. based on the proportion of shared snps, the b1k <dig> ecotype from ein prat appears more similar to the desert ecotype b1k <dig> than to b1k <dig> 

these differences are supported by the analysis of snp types. the higher absolute frequency of nssnps and of snps with functional effects, and the higher ratio of nssnps to ssnps in the desert than mediterranean ecotype reflects the larger genetic distance of the desert ecotype to cultivated barley. the higher number of functional polymorphisms in the desert ecotype may result from of a smaller effective population size causing a higher frequency of slightly deleterious amino acid polymorphisms due to reduced purifying selection, or a stronger and more frequent genome-wide positive selection as a consequence of adaptation to a stressful environment.

it should be noted that the observed distances are likely biased because of the snp calling problems, the small sample size and the sequencing of a subset of genes captured by the stress-induced library. on the other hand, the larger genetic distance between the desert ecotype to cultivated barley than between the mediterranean ecotype to cultivated barley is consistent with the phenotypic differentiation of the desert and mediterranean wild barley types to cultivated barley for several quantitative traits  <cit> . snp density at telomeric chromosomal regions is higher than in other regions in agreement with genome sequencing surveys of both cultivated and wild barley  <cit> . it may result from a higher gene density  <cit>  or increased recombination rates in telomeric regions . snp density within wild barley is  <dig> -fold greater than among wild  and cultivated barley. however, it is similar to the snp density predicted in cultivated barley from the assembly of public barley est sequences, one snp per 240 bp   <cit> . this estimate may be biased by using public est sequences originating from several genotypes for snp identification.

CONCLUSIONS
physiological analysis of drought stressed desert and mediterranean wild barley ecotypes suggested the existence of genomic differences and the resulting  <dig> transcriptome sequencing led to the discovery of novel transcripts in both ecotypes. the desert ecotype has a relatively higher snp density and more snps with significant effects on protein coding genes than the mediterranean ecotype. based on functional and evolutionary conservation, several stress-related candidate transcripts and transcription factors were identified. the data generated in this study are valuable genomic resources for further improvement of the barley transcriptome and genome annotation. using this resource, exome capture arrays can be designed to investigate presence/absence polymorphisms of putative wild-barley and ecotype-specific genes as well as to analyze genetic diversity in different groups of genes. the markers generated in the putatively stress-related genes can be used for the genetic analysis of drought adaptation and provide an avenue for the introgression of useful genetic variation into cultivated barley breeding populations.
