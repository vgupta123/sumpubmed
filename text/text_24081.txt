BACKGROUND
selenium  is an essential micronutrient for many organisms in the three domains of life. the best known biological functions of se are exerted by selenocysteine  residues  <cit> . sec, known as the 21st amino acid, is co-translationally inserted into proteins by recoding an opal  codon from stop to sec function  <cit> . these uga codons are recognized by a complex molecular machinery that has common core components, but also differences among the three domains of life  <cit> .

the mechanism of sec insertion into protein in response to uga has been most thoroughly elucidated in escherichia coli  <cit> . bacterial selenoprotein mrnas carry a sec insertion sequence  element immediately downstream of sec-encoding uga codons  <cit> . the secis element binds a sec-specific elongation factor, selb, and forms a complex with trnasec , whose uca anticodon matches the uga codon. trnasec is initially acylated with serine by seryl-trna synthetase and is then converted to sec-trnasec by sec synthase . sela utilizes selenophosphate as the selenium donor, which in turn is synthesized by selenophosphate synthetase .

in some prokaryotes, se  is used for the biosynthesis of a modified trna nucleotide, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine , which is located in the wobble position of the anticodons of trnalys, trnaglu, and trnagln  <cit> . the proposed function of seu involves codon-anticodon interactions that help base pair discrimination at the wobble position and/or translation efficiency  <cit> . a 2-selenouridine synthase  is necessary to replace a sulfur atom in 2-thiouridine in these trnas with se  <cit> .

in addition to sec and seu, se can be utilized in the form of a cofactor in certain molybdenum -containing hydroxylases  <cit> . nicotinic acid hydroxylase and xanthine dehydrogenase are the best known representatives of this protein class. in these enzymes, se is covalently bound to mo in the active site, but the specific structure of the se cofactor is not known. in nicotinic acid hydroxylase, se is lost during protein storage and during simple sds-page procedures  <cit> . these properties made it difficult to characterize this class of proteins and determine the mechanism of se cofactor structure and biosynthesis.

recently, we analyzed evolutionary dynamics of sec and seu utilization traits  in prokaryotes and reported the occurrence of orphan seld proteins in two organisms lacking known components of sec and seu traits or genes encoding selenoproteins  <cit> . these organisms included a bacterium, enterococcus faecalis, and an archaeon, haloarcula marismortui. the seld sequences in the two organisms are typical selds containing a conserved cys residue in the predicted active site and clustering with other seld sequences  <cit> . these proteins could be distinguished from thiamine-monophosphate kinase, the hydrogenase maturation factor hype, and other proteins that, like selds, have an aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase  domain. the curious presence of orphan seld in these prokaryotes suggested an additional, unknown use of se that is dependent on seld.

in this study, we carried out searches in completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes for machinery involved in se utilization. known components, i.e., sela, selb and ybbb, could be easily identified by comparative genomics, and the analyses also have generated evidence for additional proteins involved. since neighboring genes of seld may provide potential information regarding se utilization, we further employed comparative genomics tools to identify candidate genes involved in the third, seld-based trait, in prokaryotes. finally, we identified many organisms containing this new trait and carried out experimental analyses in one such organism. overall, these data provide evidence for an additional use of se in nature.

RESULTS
characterization of seld-dependent pathways of se utilization
since seld  has been shown to be a key factor for se utilization by generating a se donor compound , identification of functional linkages involving seld may help characterize the pathways of se utilization. we initially used string  to examine such functional linkages based on neighborhood, gene fusion and co-occurrence analyses. the protein with the best score was ybbb, a seu synthase . this gene was often located in the same operon with seld and the two proteins also showed similar patterns of occurrence  <cit> . the next seld link was selb , which was also identified by gene neighborhood and co-occurrence, but the linkage was independent of ybbb . as expected, selb was most closely linked with sec synthase sela , which also showed a strong association with seld.

the following seld link was nadh oxidoreductase homolog , which was fused with seld in cyanobacteria and several other organisms  <cit> . this association suggests that nadh oxidoreductase may be the reductant for a se compound and that the reduced form of this compound may be utilized by seld for biosynthesis of selenophosphate. like ybbb and sela/selb, nadh oxidoreductase function likely corresponds to the known use of se. excluding spurious predictions due to protein misannotation, the following hit was a sira-like protein that belonged to cog <dig> . this protein was associated with seld through gene neighborhood  predictions of string. thus, string-based analysis identified known proteins involved in two pathways of se utilization  and suggested the role of nadh dehydrogenase in generating a seld substrate and of sira-like protein in an unknown seld-linked process.

organisms with orphan selds
next, we examined seld-linked processes in more detail, and in particular identities of seld-linked genes that showed no association with the sec and seu pathways. among  <dig> sequenced prokaryotic genomes, we identified  <dig> seld-containing organisms . details are shown in table s <dig> . of these,  <dig> bacteria and  <dig> archaea possessed the sec pathway, whereas  <dig> bacteria and  <dig> archaea utilized seu . in addition,  <dig> seld-containing organisms were found that had orphan seld , including previously described e. faecalis and h. marismortui. additional such organisms included anaerostipes caccae, clostridium butyricum, c. phytofermentans, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus gnavus, r. obeum, r. torques and vibrio shilonii. it should be noted that except for e. faecalis, h. marismortui and v. shilonii, all other species belonged to firmicutes/clostridia where many species possess sec and/or seu utilization traits. however, previous studies have shown a highly dynamic evolution of both traits, which often results in the loss of these traits in bacterial phyla  <cit> . moreover, of the  <dig> organisms with orphan selds, c. phytofermentans, e. faecalis and h. marismortui have been completely sequenced, and most other genomes are characterized by high sequence coverage . in addition, seld typically clusters with sec and/or seu biosynthesis/insertion genes, whereas in these organisms, other genes cluster with seld. thus, the possibility that all genes involved in sec or seu utilization have not been sequenced or annotated in the genomes containing orphan seld is extremely low. the genomic context of seld in the three complete orphan seld-containing genomes is shown in fig.  <dig>  genomic context of the other  <dig> organisms is shown in fig. s <dig> .

a third pathway of se utilization
to investigate a possible new seld-associated pathway,  <dig> genes upstream and downstream of seld in the genomes with orphan selds were examined in detail. first, we found that the sira-like gene  is located next to seld in several organisms in different bacterial phyla, suggesting that the sira-like protein may be involved in se metabolism. this observation is consistent with the string analysis. the specific function of sira-like is not clear.

next, we found that two additional proteins, hypothetical proteins hp <dig>  and hp <dig> , co-occurred in seld-containing organisms, including all orphan seld-containing organisms, although homologs of each protein could also be found in organisms lacking seld. phylogenetic analyses of these two proteins are shown in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig> organisms  containing both hp <dig> and hp <dig> proteins as well as seld were identified. we noticed that all hp <dig> sequences in organisms having seld and hp <dig> were clustered in one subfamily, suggesting that these sequences might be functionally linked to seld. orthologs of hp <dig> were also found in additional seld-containing organisms  which did not have hp <dig>  although significant similarity was observed between sequences in this putative subfamily and other homologs , multiple alignment of hp <dig> sequences suggested several specific residues which are only present in the seld-linked subfamily . therefore, it appears that these hp <dig> proteins form a separate subfamily which is involved in the third se utilization trait, perhaps distinguished by some of these conserved residues. in addition, most hp <dig> sequences were found in organisms containing both seld and hp <dig>  except for  <dig> organisms which lacked hp <dig> . previously, we observed that homologs of sela, a key factor in sec biosynthesis in bacteria, are also found in organisms that lack the sec-decoding trait, suggesting that sela  might have acquired a new function in these organisms  <cit> . similarly, hp <dig> or hp <dig> homologs may also have additional functions in organisms lacking seld. co-occurrence of seld, hp <dig> and hp <dig> might provide an initial screen for identifying organisms with additional utilization of se. although two thirds of these organisms also possess either sec or seu utilization traits, the fact that  <dig> out of  <dig> organisms belonging to three different phyla  possess orphan selds argues against the possibility that these organisms are simultaneously in the process of acquiring the sec or seu traits or of losing such traits.

other candidate genes in the vicinity of seld in e. faecalis genome, e.g., ef <dig> , ef <dig>  and ef <dig> , showed wider distribution than seld itself. however, some members of these families were seld neighbors in several organisms, and some were even fused with hp <dig> or hp <dig>  these included ef <dig> , ef <dig>  and ef <dig> . these observations suggest functional links among these proteins. table  <dig> shows the genomic location of all candidate genes  in the  <dig> organisms defined by hp <dig>  hp <dig> and seld proteins. although seld was found to be in vicinity of hp <dig> and hp <dig> genes only in  <dig> organisms, all of them were orphan seld-containing prokaryotes.

the sira-like protein was also found in all  <dig> organisms possessing hp <dig> and hp <dig> proteins although some of these organisms contained its slightly more distant homologs . as discussed above, seld is often clustered with sira-like, and this situation was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> organisms. close homologs of sira-like protein were also detected in several organisms lacking hp <dig> and hp <dig>  such as methanococcus maripaludis , clostridium perfringens and thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis  and porphyromonas gingivalis . considering that proteins containing sira domain belong to a large superfamily and may have different functions, phylogenetic analysis was used to identify a sira subfamily most closely linked to hp <dig> and/or hp <dig> . however, no such branch was found. moreover, multiple alignment of sira-like sequences did not show conserved residues which are only present in organisms containing hp <dig> and hp <dig> .

to further examine functional linkages among seld, sira-like, hp <dig> and hp <dig> proteins, we, again, used string  and searched for functional associations involving sira-like, hp <dig> and hp <dig>  since no known cog is associated with hp <dig> or hp <dig>  and sira-like belongs to a large family of sira proteins defined by a single cog, we selected a "search by protein sequence" option and set the interactor tool to a protein mode. such configuration can provide maximum sensitivity although it has a slightly lower coverage compared with the cog mode  <cit> . top candidates are shown in table  <dig>  and seld was among these candidates for each examined protein. in addition, seld was the top functional link for sira-like. although both sira-like and hp1/hp <dig> seem to be functionally linked to seld, there are important differences among these proteins and which of these proteins best define the putative third se utilization trait is not clear. it is possible that sira-like protein is involved in se metabolism in all three utilization traits whereas hp <dig> and hp <dig> are only specific for the third se utilization trait.

several other detected seld neighboring genes were often located in the same operon. one exception was that we could not detect homologs of moba-related protein  in shigella dysenteriae. however, this genome is not yet complete. previous studies showed that some of these genes are involved in the formation and utilization of molybdopterin , which coordinated mo thereby generating the mo cofactor in mo-dependent enzymes  <cit> . for example, xdhc is present in various mo-utilizing organisms and is involved in mo cofactor binding and insertion into xanthine dehydrogenase  <cit> . it is possible that se  is used as an additional cofactor that supports mo utilization in certain organisms. the predicted aldehyde oxidoreductase in e. faecalis, which belongs to mo-dependent xanthine oxidase family  <cit>  and is often found to be clustered with hp <dig> and/or hp <dig> , might be a potential user which utilizes both se and mo. however, phylogenetic analysis of aldehyde oxidoreductase  did not yield a subfamily formed by organisms containing the new se utilization trait .

metabolically labeled se-binding protein in e. faecalis
to directly analyze the use of se in e. faecalis, we metabolically labeled this organism with 75se under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and in parallel we labeled e. coli strain nova blue cells as a control. in both conditions, a  <dig> kda 75se-labeled band was observed in e. faecalis extracts , whereas as expected, e. coli showed bands in the 80– <dig> kda region and the labeling pattern was different in aerobic and anaerobic conditions . after treatment with dtt , the band disappeared . 2-mercatoethanol was also effective in releasing se, whereas these treatments had no influence on the 75se bands in e. coli extracts as these corresponded to sec-containing proteins . the observations suggest that e. faecalis does utilize se, that this element occurs in a protein of ~ <dig> kda and that this se species is labile and is not sec. therefore, it is possible that this  <dig> kda protein may be involved in the third seld-related, se utilization trait. it should be noted, however, that an additional utilization of se in e. faecalis unrelated to seld function could not be excluded. independent of its nature, both computational and experimental data exclude a possibility of sec and seu use and suggest a novel use of se in this organism.

the large subunits of proteins in the xanthine oxidase family , whose molecular weights are over  <dig> kda, bind mpt . the detected  <dig> kda protein in e. faecalis is inconsistent with the aldehyde oxidoreductase large subunit. similarly, the aldehyde oxidoreductase small subunit , which binds 2fe-2s, was also excluded because it is fused with the large subunit in e. faecalis. thus, the  <dig> kda se-binding protein is unlikely to be a member of the mo-dependent hydroxylase family. it is interesting, however, that both hp <dig> and hp <dig> have similar predicted molecular weights . thus, one of them might be the detected protein.

we carried out a number of chromatographic steps to purify the  <dig> kda se-binding protein. it was binding both deae-sepharose and phenyl-sepharose and could be enriched on these columns. however, lability and consistent loss of se precluded its identification. we also attempted two-dimensional page analysis of the se-binding protein , but no 75se radioactive spot was found following this procedure, suggesting that two-dimensional page conditions also led to the release of se from the se-binding protein. further studies will be needed to determine the identity of the  <dig> kda se-binding protein. our current studies, however, suggested the presence of a novel utilization of se in an orphan seld-containing organism, e. faecalis, which appears to be the third trait of se utilization in prokaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we carried out comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses to identify new genes linked to se utilization in prokaryotes. we identified several organisms with orphan seld that we predict to possess the third se utilization trait, which is not limited to these species. seld, hp <dig>  hp <dig> as well as sira-like were identified as the best candidate signature genes for this trait. we further directly demonstrated the use of se in e. faecalis by detecting a  <dig> kda protein containing a non-sec, non-seu labile se species. it cannot be excluded that se is used as a co-factor for certain mo hydroxylases , but current evidence does not provide strong support for this possibility. further studies are required to determine whether the  <dig> kda se-binding protein or other proteins in organisms with orphan selds represent the use of se in this organism, or it is an intermediate state for further delivery to other proteins, such as mo-dependent hydroxylases.
