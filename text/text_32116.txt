BACKGROUND
sporothrix schenckii is a human and animal pathogen belonging to the family ophiostomataceae  <cit> . while this family of fungi includes important plant pathogens, s. schenckii is a human pathogen commonly found in soil or vegetation with infections commonly seen in agricultural workers and gardeners. it is the etiologic agent of a disease known as sporotrichosis, an important cutaneous lymphatic mycosis with a worldwide distribution  <cit> . s. schenckii is dimorphic and can grow either in a mycelial form with long branching filaments at 25°c or in the form of spherical ovoid yeast cells which are typically found in animal hosts  <cit> .

in nature or in animal hosts, fungal cells must respond efficiently to changing environmental conditions in order to survive. cell membrane receptors play an essential role in the response of the fungal cell to the environment. information is conveyed to the interior of the cell following the binding of ligands to receptors. the heterotrimeric g proteins constitute a family of gtpases that transmit messages received at cell surface receptors  to cytoplasmic effector proteins inside the cell  <cit> . heterotrimeric g proteins are made up of three subunits: the gtp-binding α subunit and the tightly associated complex of β and γ subunits. once a ligand binds to a receptor, the heterotrimeric g proteins are activated, initiating the exchange of gdp to gtp in the gα subunit causing a conformational change that results in the dissociation of the heterotrimer into gα-gtp and gβγ subunits. the gα-gtp and/or gβγ subunits interact with effector proteins such as enzymes or ion channels, resulting in the regulation of a broad range of cellular processes and pathways  <cit> . many genes encoding heterotrimeric g protein subunits have been described in fungi. gpa-like g protein α subunits are present in: saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , cryptococcus neoformans  <cit>  and candida albicans  <cit> , and in the plant pathogens ustilago maydis  <cit> , among others. gα subunits similar to the traditional gα class rather than to the gpa group have been described in the filamentous fungi and plant pathogens such as aspergillus nidulans  <cit> , neurospora crassa  <cit> , cryphonectria parasitica  <cit> , and magnaporthe grisea  <cit> .

in s. schenckii, we reported the first member of the gαi family in a human pathogenic fungus  <cit> . the cdna of ssg- <dig> encoded a  <dig> amino acids pertussis toxin sensitive gαi subunit of  <dig> kda. subsequently, we identified and sequenced two new g protein alpha subunit genes in this fungus encoding ssg- <dig>  <cit>  and ssg- <dig> . the ssg- <dig> cdna encoded a protein with  <dig> amino acids and a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the ssg- <dig> cdna encoded a protein with  <dig> amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. these three proteins have the consensus sequences that identify gα subunits, which are the five highly conserved domains that form the guanine nucleotide binding site that define the gα protein superfamily  <cit> .

gα subunits have been implicated in the regulation of fungal development and pathogenicity mostly based on the evidence derived from gene knock-out studies. in n. crassa, deletion of the gαi homologue gna- <dig>  results in impaired proliferation, defective macroconidiation, and production of abnormal female reproductive structures. a second gα subunit gene in n. crassa, gna- <dig>  has overlapping functions with gna- <dig>  as demonstrated by a double deletion assay  <cit> . the third gα subunit gene in n. crassa is gna- <dig>  mutants of gna- <dig> share several phenotypes with the adenylyl cyclase mutants such as premature conidiation, short aerial hyphae and reduced ascospore viability  <cit> .

strains of the chestnut blight fungus c. parasitica, harboring rna viruses exhibit reduced levels of virulence, which were attributed to lower levels of the gαi subunit cpg- <dig>  <cit> . disruption of cpg- <dig> affects hyphal growth, conidiation, female fertility, and virulence. disruption of a second g protein α subunit gene, cpg- <dig>  resulted in a slight reduction of growth rate and asexual sporulation, but no significant reduction in virulence  <cit> . further testing of g protein subunits in c. parasitica revealed a third gα homologue, cpg- <dig>  but its functions have not been determined  <cit> .

m. grisea, the fungal pathogen that causes rice blast disease, has three gα subunits  <cit> . disruption of the gαi subunit gene, magb, reduces vegetative growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, pathogenicity, and blocks sexual development  <cit> . also, the targeted deletion of a regulator of g protein signalling, moric <dig>  which interacts with the pertussis sensitive magb alpha subunit, rendered the fungus non-pathogenic  <cit> . disruption of the two other gα subunit genes, maga and magc, affected latter stages of sexual development  <cit> .

in u. maydis, which causes corn smut disease, four genes encoding gα subunits, gpa <dig> to gpa <dig>  have been described  <cit> . the gpa <dig>  gpa <dig>  and gpa <dig> have homologues in other fungal species, but the gpa <dig> is unique to this fungus. gpa <dig> is most closely related to the gpa- <dig> of c. neoformans , and is required for u. maydis pathogenicity, and mating  <cit> .

the studies mentioned above are a few examples of the work done on the role of gα subunits in the biology of fungi. specifically they demonstrate a role for these subunits in the response to stressful conditions and pathogenicity. nevertheless, the actual proteins with which these gα subunits interact have not been identified. our initial inquiry into the protein-protein interactions involving heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunits was done using ssg- <dig> as bait. in this case, we identified a cytoplasmic phospholipase  homologue interacting with this gα subunit  <cit> . this was the first report of a g protein alpha subunit interacting with a protein directly related to pathogenicity in fungi. pla <dig> was also found to be necessary for the expression of the dimorphic potential of s. schenckii  <cit> .

in this work, we inquired into the proteins interacting with the s. schenckii pertussis sensitive g protein alpha subunit, ssg- <dig>  using the yeast two-hybrid assay. we identified proteins related to the response of fungi to stressful conditions and pathogenicity. the identification of such important proteins as partners of ssg- <dig> offers evidence on how this gα subunit can affect survival of the fungus in the human or animal host and enhances our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the disease producing processes of fungi.

RESULTS
more than  <dig> inserts from colonies growing in quadruple drop out medium   from two different s. schenckii yeast cdna libraries were analyzed for the presence of ssg- <dig> interacting proteins. only inserts from colonies that grew in qdo and were positive for x-α-gal were cloned and sequenced. four of these colonies were chosen for further characterization because the inserts were identified as encoding proteins related to survival in stressful conditions and/or pathogenicity in many microorganisms, specifically fungi  <cit> . these inserts encoded the c-terminal domains of a mitochondrial superoxide dismutase , a cation transporter of the nramp family, a sidereophore-iron transporter and glyceraldehyde-3-p dehydrogenase .

genetic and bioinformatic characterization of s. schenckii sod 
the sequence obtained by pcr from the insert in colony number  <dig> showed a  <dig> bp product and a derived amino acid sequence of  <dig> amino acids containing part of an fe/mn sod c-terminal domain. the tag stop codon at the end of the coding sequence was followed by a  <dig> bp 3'utr and a  <dig> bp poly a+ tail. the online blast algorithm  <cit>  matched the sequence to the c-terminal domain of superoxide dismutase from aspergillus fumigatus .

the sequencing strategy used to complete the coding sequence of the sssod cdna is shown in figure 1a. the cdna and coding sequence were completed  as shown in figure 1b using 5'race. this figure shows a cdna of  <dig> bp with an orf of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the panther classification system  <cit>  identified this protein as a member of the sod <dig> family   with an extremely significant e value of  <dig>  e- <dig>  figure 1b does not show the characteristic histidine residues that are part of the metal ion binding site in human sod <dig> , h <dig> and h <dig>  in s. schenckii, h <dig> is substituted by d <dig>  another metal binding residue, present in human sod <dig>  d <dig> is absent from this protein and its homologues . in s. schenckii, it is substituted by s <dig> and n in all other fungal homologues . another metal binding residue, h <dig> in human sod <dig> is present in s. schenckii as h <dig>  residues that are present in 100% of the sods and the gxgx signature  are shadowed in yellow in figure 1b.

a mitochondrial targeting sequence was identified using psort ii  <cit> , with a putative cleavage site at amino acid  <dig>  and a probability of it being mitochondrial of  <dig> % vs. a probability of it being cytoplasmic of  <dig> %. psort ii  <cit>  also identified an endoplasmic reticulum  membrane modified retention signal at the n-terminus  and the c-terminus . the targetp  <dig>  server  <cit>  predicted a shorter mitochondrial signal peptide with a length of  <dig> amino acids. this signal peptide length is more in accordance with the structure of other members of the sod <dig> family.

a multiple sequence alignment of the derived amino acid sequence of sssod to other fungal sod homologues and the human sod <dig> is included in additional file  <dig>  blast search for the deduced amino acid sequence identified this protein as approximately 40% identical to a fe/mn sods of fungi such as: chaetomium globosum, gibberella zeae and m. grisea, among others .

genetic and bioinformatic characterization of s. schenckii nramp 
the insert in colony number  <dig> was identified as the c-terminal domain of an nramp  homologue after sequencing. this insert was preliminarily identified as a sequence that matched with nramp transporters from a. fumigatus  using the online blast algorithm  <cit> .

the coding sequence of the ssnramp cdna was completed using 5' race as shown in figure 2a . figure 2b shows the  <dig> bp cdna with an orf of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. this figure also shows the sequence of the original insert isolated from colony <dig> shadowed in gray that consisted of  <dig> bp orf followed by a  <dig> bp 3'utr and  <dig> bp poly a+ tail.

the invariant residues are highlighted in yellow in figure 2b. these include residues: d <dig> , e <dig> , h <dig>  and r <dig> , and the highly conserved residues: d <dig>  and d <dig> . g <dig> is also conserved in all nramp homologues and in ssnramp it corresponds to g <dig>  the amino acid sequence, dpgn, constitutes an nramp invariant motif and is present in ssnramp  and its homologues. this motif is located between tm helix  <dig> and tm helix  <dig> and is extra-cytoplasmic as expected.

using the panther classification system  <cit>  to analyze the deduced amino acid sequence, we identified this protein as a metal transporter of the nramp family  with an e value of  <dig>  e- <dig>  blocks server analysis showed natural resistance-associated macrophage protein signature from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  psort ii analysis  <cit>  of this nramp homologue suggests that it resides in the plasma membrane with  <dig> %, plasma membrane vs.  <dig> % endoplasmic reticulum. using the tmhmm server we found the  <dig> transmembrane helices that characterize this transporter family as shown in figure  <dig> 

a multiple sequence alignment of the derived amino acid sequence ssnramp and other fungal homologues is included as additional file  <dig>  the percent identity of ssnramp to that of other fungi such n. crassa, s. cerevisiae and coccidioides posadasii among others, is in the range of  <dig> to 56% .

genetic and bioinformatic characterization of s. schenckii sit 
the online blast algorithm matched the sequence obtained from the insert in colony number  <dig> with a putative siderophore transporter from a. fumigatus   <cit> . this insert contained  <dig> bp and encoded  <dig> amino acids of a siderophore-iron transporter c-terminal domain followed by a  <dig> bp 3'utr.

the sequencing strategy used for obtaining the cdna coding sequence of the sssit gene homologue was based on 5'race, shown in figure 4a. this figure shows a cdna of  <dig> bp with an orf of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda . the panther classification system  <cit>  identified this protein as a siderophore-iron transporter  <dig> of the major facilitator superfamily   with an extremely significant

e value of  <dig> e- <dig>  <cit> . using the tmhmm server we found  <dig> transmembrane helices as shown in figure  <dig>  the number and localization of the transmembrane helices fluctuated between  <dig> and  <dig> helices, depending on the transmembrane helix prediction server used. further studies will be needed to address these discrepancies, therefore, the predicted membrane topology must be considered to be speculative. all prediction servers coincide in the identification of the  <dig> tm helices shown in additional file  <dig> containing the multiple sequence alignment. psort ii analysis  <cit>  classifies this transporter as residing in the plasma membrane .

in additional file  <dig>  multiple sequence alignment of the derived amino acid sequence sssit and other siderophore-iron transporter homologues from fungi such as g. zeae, c. globosum and aspergillus flavus is shown. the percent identity of sssit varied considerably between the s. schenckii transporter and that of other fungi. the highest percent identity was approximately 74% to that of g. zeae .

genetic and bioinformatic characterization of s. schenckii gapdh 
a gapdh homologue identified as being present in the surface of various fungi, was the insert from colony number  <dig>  <cit> . this insert had  <dig> bp and encoded a <dig> amino acid sequence. this represented almost half of the amino acid sequence of gapdh and a  <dig> bp 3'utr. the online blast algorithm matched the sequence with gapdh from g. zeae  with 87% identity in the c-terminal region  <cit> .

a multiple sequence alignment of ssgapdh to other gapdh fungal homologues such as those from m. grisea, g. zeae and c. globosum is given in additional file  <dig>  this figure shows the extremely high degree of conservation among these proteins in the range of  <dig> to 87% .

confirmation of the ssg-1-protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot
the results that confirm the interaction observed between ssg- <dig> and ssnramp by co-ip and western blot analysis are shown in figure 7b. lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-cmyc antibody that identified ssg- <dig>  lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-ha antibody that recognizes the original ssnramp c-terminal domain isolated from the yeast two-hybrid clone. this band is of the expected size  because the original insert contained the last  <dig> amino acids of the protein fused to the gal- <dig> activation domain .

co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis shown in figure 7c confirmed the interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay between ssg- <dig> and sssit. lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-cmyc antibody that recognizes ssg- <dig>  lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-ha antibody that recognizes the original sssit fragment isolated from the yeast two-hybrid clone. this band is of the expected size  taking into consideration the molecular weight of the last  <dig> amino acids of the protein and that of the gal- <dig> activation domain .

the interaction between ssg- <dig> and ssgapdh by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis is shown in figure 7d. lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-cmyc antibody that recognizes ssg- <dig>  lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-ha antibody that recognizes the original ssgapdh fragment isolated from the yeast two-hybrid clone. this band is of the expected size  considering that the insert encoded only the last  <dig> amino acids of the protein and that the fragment was fused to the gal- <dig> activation domain .

discussion
heterotrimeric g proteins are universal recipients of environmental signals in all living eukaryotic cells  <cit> . genes encoding g protein subunits have been extensively studied in fungi  <cit> , but in there is limited information available regarding heterotrimeric g proteins signalling pathways in the pathogenic fungi other than that related to the camp dependent pathway. further inquiry is needed to comprehend the full scope of g protein signalling pathways in pathogenic fungi. an important way to discover other signalling pathways involving heterotrimeric g proteins is to study protein-protein interaction. this study was aimed at identifying important components of the g protein alpha subunit ssg- <dig> signalling using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach. more than  <dig> potential interacting proteins were identified but we chose to corroborate and inform the interactions of s. schenckii homologues of four very important proteins: sod, nramp, sit <dig> and gapdh. all of these proteins have been identified in other fungi as being involved in pathogenicity or environmental stress response as will be discussed below.

the superoxide dismutase  identified as interacting with ssg- <dig> belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of oxygen radical to hydrogen peroxide eliminating superoxide anions generated in aerobic respiration  <cit> . many sod genes have been identified in fungal genomes  <cit> . sods have been shown to contribute to growth and survival of fungi under oxidative stress conditions, specifically inside macrophages. in c. neoformans, sod <dig> mutants were observed to be less virulent while sod <dig> mutants had increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and showed decreased growth at elevated temperatures  <cit> . virulence in c. neoformans variety gattii has been reported to be dependent on both sod <dig> and sod <dig>  <cit> . in c. albicans the null mutant of mitochondrial sod <dig> was more sensitive than wild-type cells to stress  <cit>  and the sod <dig> null mutant had attenuated virulence  <cit> .

s. schenckii superoxide dismutases have not been studied. in fact, this is the first report of the presence of a member of this protein family in this fungus. analysis of the amino acid sequence of sssod against the homo sapiens database using blast shows that it is homologous to the human manganese superoxide dismutase sod <dig> family with 32% identity. this same analysis, using the fungal databases revealed that sssod is phylogenetically closely related to sods of the filamentous fungi with the sequence identity being in the range of 23-43%. also sssod has a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, very close to that of other fungal homologues. the specific role of sod <dig> in s. schenckii stress and pathogenesis has yet to be addressed.

fungal sods have two main locations: cytosolic or mitochondrial  <cit> . analysis using psort ii  <cit>  and targetp  <cit>  suggests that sssod isolated by the yeast two-hybrid analysis is a mitochondrial sod. being a mitochondrial protein does not disqualify sssod as an interacting partner of ssg- <dig>  it is important to note that gαi subunits can be present not only in the cytoplasm but also in the mitochondria  <cit> . also, sods acquire the metal ion during protein synthesis and this seems to occur in the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondrial membrane. it is also of interest to note that another mitochondrial protein was also found to interact with ssg- <dig> . this protein belongs of the mitochondrial metal transporter protein family  that is known to be involved in the acquisition of the metal ion by sods  <cit> . these results together with the interactions of ssg- <dig> and the metal ion transporters ssnramp and sssit, discussed below suggest a possible role of ssg- <dig> in sods metal acquisition.

metals are essential nutrients and important co-factors of a variety of proteins and enzymes; they are required for the survival of all organisms. fungi have developed multiple strategies to acquire metals from the environment  <cit> . the human host is a hostile environment for invading pathogens because it actively sequesters and limits nutrients  <cit> . the term nutritional immunity has been coined to describe metal ion sequestration  <cit> . in this work we have identified a homologue of the nramp family of cation transporters present in higher organisms and yeasts  <cit>  as interacting with ssg- <dig>  this family of transporters is associated with virulence in bacteria and to resistance to infection in mammalian hosts  <cit> . the nramp family specifically transports manganese and iron although they have the capacity to transport other divalent cations such as nickel, zinc, copper, cobalt and cadmium  <cit> . they are characterized by a hydrophobic core with 10- <dig> transmembrane helices  <cit> , also present in the s. schenckii homologue described here. the nramp family consists of nramp <dig>  nramp <dig>  and the yeast proteins smf <dig>  smf <dig> and smf <dig>  <cit> . smf <dig> and smf <dig> are believed to be involved in manganese homeostasis. smf <dig> is a cell surface manganese transporter  <cit> . the s. schenckii nramp described here is more closely related to smf <dig>  it is similar in size to smf <dig> and is predicted to be located in the plasma membrane by psort ii analysis  <cit> . although there is considerable similarity between ssnramp and smf <dig>  ssnramp's role in cation transport must be elucidated and its substrate identified.

another critical aspect for the survival of fungal pathogens inside the host is the capacity to accumulate iron  <cit> . in this work we report a siderophore-iron transporter as interacting with ssg- <dig>  in response to low iron availability, most fungi synthesize siderophores that chelate iron which is ultimately taken up as a siderophore-iron complex  <cit>  by members of the major facilitator superfamily transporters   <cit> . members of the mfs do not possess well-defined conserved motifs as it is known from other transporter superfamilies but the panther classification system identified sssit <dig> as a siderophore iron transporter. studies in c. albicans revealed a role for a siderophore iron transporter  in epithelial invasion. gene knock-out studies of sit <dig> led to a reduction in the invasion and penetration of epithelia by this fungus  <cit> . in c. neoformans, sit <dig> has a role in the structure of the cell wall and melanization  <cit> .

it is of interest to note that s. schenckii is capable of producing its own siderophores, unlike s. cerevisiae that does not  <cit> . the identification of the relationship between siderophore iron transport and a gα subunit opens a new angle to the already complex regulation of iron uptake in fungi and identifies g proteins as potentially important players in the tightly regulated mechanism of iron acquisition.

the reported interaction of these two ion transport proteins with ssg- <dig> in s. schenckii is a key factor discussed here. in addition to the ion transporters reported in this work, ssg- <dig> has been observed to interact with a monosaccharide transporter of the mfs family  and ssg- <dig> can interact with a hexose transporter of this same family of proteins . it is a known fact that heterotrimeric g proteins interact with classical receptor proteins in the membrane resulting in the activation of signal transduction pathways. however, it has been observed that nutrient carriers can also function as receptors for signalling  <cit> . the activation of signal transduction pathways by nutrients has been recognized in other systems mainly, s. cerevisiae  <cit> . yet, many of the primary intracellular receptors of the signals generated through nutrient carriers have not been identified. in this paper we offer evidence that links transport molecules to g protein signalling and suggests that g proteins could be one of the effectors of nutrient sensing in fungi. there is a hypothesis that gpcr receptors may have evolved from nutrient transporters that gradually lost their transport capacity  <cit> . our findings provide a new avenue to study this evolutionary hypothesis.

another ssg- <dig> interacting protein identified in this work was gapdh, a highly conserved fungal protein as shown in additional file  <dig>  the presence of gapdh, a glycolytic enzyme, on the surface of fungal cells has been reported for various fungal species, such as c. albicans  <cit>  and paracoccidiodes braziliensis  <cit> . this alternative localization of the enzyme suggests other roles for this protein besides glycolysis, possibly related to pathogenesis and stress response. in p. braziliensis, this enzyme has been identified as important in the adhesion to pneumocytes  <cit>  while in s. cerevisiae, gapdh was reported to affect survival under condition of oxidative stress as a target for s-thiolation,  <cit> . in schizosaccharomyces pombe gapdh was transiently oxidized in response to hydrogen peroxide, enhancing the association between a response regulator and mapkkk's promoting peroxide stress signalling  <cit> . the association of gapdh to ssg- <dig> offers additional information to be considered when assessing the role of gapdh outside of its traditional function as a glycolytic enzyme.

the actual identification of protein-protein interactions constitutes a very important and necessary step if we are to understand the role of g proteins in fungal signalling pathways. the results presented in this paper suggests the involvement of ssg- <dig> with proteins whose role in many other fungi have been recognized as part of the protective mechanism against the strain that both the environment and the human host pose for the survival of the fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study constitutes the first report of the protein-protein interactions of the fungal gαi subunit ssg- <dig> with cellular proteins. sod, gapdh, and two metal ion transporters were identified as ssg- <dig> interacting proteins and these interactions were confirmed using co-ip. the identification of such important proteins as partners of a gα subunit in this fungus suggests possible mechanisms through which this g protein can affect pathogenesis or survival under conditions of stress and nutrient limitation inside the human host or the environment. these proteins belong to different families and have different but well-established roles, yet all converge in a common role: involvement in the response to stress. individually, sod <dig> is well known as a major player in the elimination of ros in all cells while gapdh has been recognized as promoting resistance to oxidative stress in fungi. the two ion transporters identified in this work are important in overcoming the metal ion limitations imposed on invading pathogens by the human or animal host as a defence mechanism and provide the necessary metal co-factors for sods and other important proteins. the association of g protein alpha subunits to transport molecules reinforces the role of g proteins in the response to environmental signals and also highlights the involvement of fungal g protein alpha subunits in nutrient sensing in s. schenckii. these interactions suggest that these permeases could function as transceptors for g proteins in fungi.
