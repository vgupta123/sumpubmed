BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms  have stimulated interest in recent years due to their importance in orchestrating physiological behavior, biological processes, and adaptability of biological systems to changes in environment  <cit> . many circadian-related genes have been explored using high-throughput dna microarray technology  <cit> . these studies also have stimulated efforts to apply and develop methodologies in circular/directional statistics to elucidate important characteristics of circadian gene expression and also compare their patterns of peak expression times  across different tissue types, to help elucidate their diverse tissue-specific functions  <cit> .

as periodic oscillation characterizes the expression pattern of both circadian genes and cell cycle genes, many correlation-based and fourier-based methodologies  <cit>  proposed for analyzing cell cycle gene expression can be directly applied to circadian gene expression analysis. however, there are some distinct differences between studies in cell cycle gene expression and circadian gene expression. first, most cell cycle gene expression patterns are based on cell cultures studied in vitro, while most circadian gene expressions are based on various tissues or organs in vivo. consequently, circadian gene expression may be more complex or tissue/cell-specific. second, the four phases of a cell cycle, namely, g <dig>  s, g <dig>  and m phases, have been well characterized through intensive research over the last thirty years, and more than  <dig> mammalian  <cit>  and  <dig> yeast cell cycle genes have been identified  <cit> . in contrast, to date, less is known about circadian genes: only eight core mammalian circadian genes have been identified: csnk1e, cry <dig>  cry <dig>  per <dig>  per <dig>  per <dig>  clock, and bmall  <cit> . in addition, it is not clear whether these known circadian genes and any other circadian-related genes identified from high-throughput microarrays can be assigned to a few functional phases, in analogy to the phases  in cell cycle. note that many studies on cell cycle gene expression based on microarray were on same organism  <cit>  and cell-type  <cit>  under different experimental conditions. therefore, we expect that a set of cell cycle genes commonly expressed in various conditions are consistent in their peak expression/activation time  <cit> . however, it is an opening question whether phases or peak expression times for a set of circadian-related genes commonly expressed in multiple tissues, such as heart, liver, kidney, and scn of the hypothalamus are in synchrony because expression of some circadian-related genes may be tissue-specific. statistical tools for analyzing such a type of circular data cross multiple tissues need to be developed.

the phase angles estimated from cycling transcripts in panda et al.  <cit>  and storch et al.  <cit>  can be regarded as points on a circle of unit radius, which are treated as circular data in circular/directional statistics  <cit> . circular data are commonly modeled with a von mises distribution function on the unit circle, an analog to the normal distribution for linear data. the main feature of circular data is that it is directional and classical methods based on linear data can produce meaningless results. as an example, suppose a bird takes off in the northeast direction at an angle of 2°, while another takes off in the southeast direction at an angle 358° then their mean direction  is 180°, or due west! means and variances and other statistical analyses must respect the directional nature of the data to avoid such nonsensical results. for example, a sum of two points on a unit circle is calculated as the sum of the two vectors, yielding a vector with certain direction and length. with this vector averaging, the two birds now have a mean direction of 0°, corresponding properly to due east. special methods are available in the literature for describing correlation and regression between circular variables  <cit> . one needs to be cautious when analyzing circular and linear variables simultaneously. in some cases circadian phase angles have been mistreated as linear variables in linear regression of the phase angle on the period and amplitude  <cit> . results so obtained may not be useful for interpretation.

the motivation for our work is based on the observation in  <cit>  that some circadian-related genes that are expressed in two tissues are systematically lagged in peak expression time in the two tissues. panda et al.  <cit>  reported that many of the  <dig> circadian-related transcripts common to the suprachiasmatic nuclei  of the hypothalamus and liver, including per <dig> and rev-erbβ, are delayed by 4– <dig> hrs in peak expression in liver relative to the scn. ueda et al.  <cit>  validated in vitro that the rev-erba/ror response element in both the scn and liver tissues is expressed in phase with bmal <dig> and in anti-phase with per <dig> oscillation. these studies suggest that the coordinated temporal expression of circadian genes in-phase and anti-phase in different tissues is an interesting but a complex biological phenomenon. statistical analysis tools for studying this type of interesting biological questions arising in recent genomics studies are needed.

to address the above questions, we propose a few steps in the following sections. given a set of circadian-related genes common to two tissues, we first fit a random-periods model  <cit>  to the time-course expression for each gene individually in each of two tissues, to estimate its phase angles along with periods and amplitudes. the angular difference between the two phases for each gene can be represented as an angle, i.e. as a point on a circle. using a mixture of two von mises distributions, we cluster angular differences of the genes into two groups; genes whose expressions are synchronized  in the two tissues and those whose expressions are different in the two tissues. the identified clusters may provide a hint on association of circadian genes specific to these tissues. we then assess the association of each set of genes common to two tissues using down and mardia's circular-circular regression model  <cit> . in addition, we propose a new circular-circular regression-based bootstrap method to assess the mixture of two homogeneous phase distributions for the two tissues. we illustrate the proposed methodologies using the heart and liver circadian-related gene expression data sets from storch et al.  <cit> .

methods
phase estimation
one characterizing feature of circadian-related genes expression is the periodically oscillating pattern. sinusoidal functions have been used to model the circadian gene expression level  <cit> . we apply the "random-periods model"  <cit>  to estimate the phase angles, period, and amplitude together for a given circadian gene expression using nonlinear least-squares regression. while there is no attenuation in circadian gene expression, the sinusoidal component of the "random-periods model" is reduced to a simple sinusoidal function kgcos, where kg, tg,, and φg are the amplitude, period, and phase  of gene g. the phase parameter φg indicates when the expression of the g gene reaches its maximum.

a mixture of two von mises distributions for circular paired-difference data
after estimation of activation times or phase angles for a set of circadian-related genes that expressed in two tissues or organs, we are interested in examining whether the phase angles are synchronous or not. let φ^gx

RESULTS
datasets
we apply our methodologies to  <dig> circadian-related cycling transcripts that are expressed in mouse heart and liver tissues, identified by storch et al.  <cit> . in storch's studies, mice were entrained to a  <dig> hrs light/dark cycle for more than two weeks, then placed in a constant dim light for more than  <dig> hrs. the tissue samples were taken from sacrificed mice at 4-hour intervals for  <dig> hrs, or about two circadian cycles, as in the circadian studies of panda et al.  <cit> .

due to the poor fit of our random-periods model  <cit>  to the expression of four transcripts , we excluded them from the list of  <dig> circadian-related transcripts  <cit>  in our analysis. the estimated phase angles for the remaining  <dig> transcripts in both heart and liver for clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the angular differences  Δg are plotted in figure  <dig> 

 <dig> radian =  <dig>  degrees.

the  <dig> circadian-related cycling transcripts were assigned into two clusters based on a mixture of two von mises distributions, as described above. the first cluster contains  <dig> genes  and the second cluster contains  <dig> genes . the five estimated parameters  = . the distance between the two clusters in mean direction  is  <dig>  rads, suggesting that the ten transcripts in cluster  <dig> have different points of peak expression in heart and liver. this can also be seen in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the mean direction of  <dig> phase angles in the cluster  <dig> is - <dig>  rads, suggesting that the peak expression times for the  <dig> cycling genes in heart and liver are close to synchronized. in contrast, the peak expression times for the  <dig> genes in heart and liver  are away from the  <dig> direction by  <dig>  rads, with heart ahead of liver by about  <dig> hrs. this result suggests that these  <dig> discordant circadian-related genes may play different roles in the heart and liver.

we estimated the across-tissue association of the genes in each of the two clusters by regressing the phase angles in heart, denoted as y, onto those in liver, denoted as x, using the circular-circular regression model described above . the estimated rotational parameters, the slope, and the concentration parameter for the von mises distribution are  =  for cluster  <dig> and  =  for cluster  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the residuals for all genes, i.e. the angular difference between the phase angle in heart and the prediction based on the same gene's pattern of expression in liver. the residuals for the  <dig> genes in the second cluster are shown in figure  <dig>  we can see that the activation times of these transcripts in heart and liver tissues are matched well after a  <dig>  radian clockwise rotation of the phase angles in heart relative to in liver. upon obtaining the 'slope parameters' ω^1

based on  <dig> bootstraps using the procedure outlined in section of bootstrap test, we found that the estimated p-value for sufficiency of a one-component distribution in the phase difference of heart and liver tissues for the  <dig> genes was  <dig> . although this is not significant at 5% level of significance, it suggests that a two-component von-mises distribution for the phase in heart and liver tissues better describes the relationships among the peak expression times for the studied genes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of the peak expression times  for a set of 48-circadian-related genes expressed in both heart and liver tissues  <cit>  suggests that not all of the genes are maximally expressed at the same time in the two tissues. instead, among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> are synchronized in phase or peak expression times in heart and liver tissues, and the other  <dig> genes express earlier by about  <dig>  rads or  <dig> hours in heart than in liver. our bootstrapping test result supports, albeit weakly, the existence of two distinct subsets among the  <dig> genes. although our findings are based on the single experimental dataset of storch et al.  <cit> , our results are similar to an earlier observation made by panda et al.  <cit>  that the peak expression times for some genes are not synchronized in suprachiasmatic nuclei  compared to liver. one implication of our results, giving quantitative support for the conclusion of storch et al.  <cit> , may be that some commonly expressed circadian-related genes may perform different functions across different organs  <cit> .

we have developed a new bootstrap method for assessing the adequacy of one versus the need for two clusters of genes in the two sets of phase angles in heart and liver tissues for the  <dig> genes. in particular, we evaluated the significance of the circular variances of the residuals from circular-circular regression of the phase angles in heart on in liver in one cluster vs. two clusters. in contrast, most studies on mixtures of circular variables have focused on dividing a set of data into two subsets. to the best of our knowledge, no studies have used a mixture of two components for circular datasets for testing heterogeneity of a cyclic pattern.

this work would not have been undertaken without the interesting observations by panda et al.  <cit> , storch et al.  <cit>  and ueda et al.  <cit>  that a few circadian-related genes expressed out of phase across two tissues of mouse. in addition, quantitatively the results of our statistical analysis depend on the approximation of sinusoidal waveform for circadian gene expression, on reasonably accurate estimation of the phase angles, on a relative large sample size of genes common to two tissues, on the approximate validity of the von mises distribution for each cluster of differences. in previous circadian gene expression studies  <cit> , a tissue sample was commonly taken at each 4-hr interval for two circadian cycles, i.e.,  <dig> time points per gene expression. although our fits to the  <dig> circadian gene expression in both tissues are reasonably good, as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>  further experimental and simulation studies may be needed to understand the role of sample size and sampling frequency on phase estimation when a sinusoidal waveform is presumed for circadian rhythm. in this work, we considered the difference of two phases for a gene in two tissues as a random variable modeled by a von mises distribution on a circle. the corresponding uncertainties are captured by the degree to which the von mises distribution is spread out on the circle.

the  <dig> circadian related genes expressed in heart and liver of mouse each provide a pair of peak expression times. we have assumed that there are at most two clusters. further experimental studies are needed for testing whether there might be more than two clusters with for  <dig> genes. while our method can hypothetically be extended to allow one to test the need for  <dig> clusters rather than for  <dig> clusters, the sample size of  <dig> genes, may not be sufficient to carry out such a test with much power. the results of the two-clusters analysis must be regarded as descriptive. our analysis of circadian gene expression may serve to stimulate further methodological development in circular/directional statistical analysis of genes that may be expressed differently in phase in two or more tissues. the genes in each cluster would need to be scrutinized separately for further elucidation of their tissue-specific biological and physiological functions  <cit> .

our methodologies can be, in principle, extended to analyzing multiple circadian gene expression data sets across multiple tissues , e.g., kidney, heart, liver, and scn where investigators are interested in understanding whether there is one set of core circadian-related genes that are similar in their patterns of activation across different organs , and others that are differently expressed in different tissues, as suggested by reppert and weaver  <cit> . because the maximum likelihood approach considered in this paper may become challenging due to computational complexity, further methodology development is needed in this area. for such multiple mixture problems, one may want to consider a bayes or empirical bayes approach. however, to the best of our knowledge, bayes and empirical bayes methods for mixture problems associated with circular data are not well developed. the present application provides an excellent opportunity for developing such methodology for mixture problems associated with circular data. secondly, using the standard likelihood approach, we clustered the  <dig> genes into two clusters on the basis of the phase difference between the two tissues. it would be interesting and useful to derive an estimate of "reliability" of clustering for each gene. one possible approach is to perform a bootstrap by selecting a simple random sample of  <dig> genes from the list of  <dig> genes and classify them into two clusters using procedure described in this paper. this procedure could be repeated for a large number of times, say  <dig>  one then could estimate the proportion of times a gene was classified into one of two clusters. unfortunately, such a procedure does not work well when the number of genes is small and their "true" cluster memberships are unknown and the numbers of genes in each cluster are highly unbalanced. nonetheless, these important questions need to be addressed because the number of potential applications for such a procedure is ever growing.
