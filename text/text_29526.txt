BACKGROUND
the heat shock response is a universal phenomenon, and heat shock proteins  form the most ancient and sophisticated cellular defense system present in all living organisms  <cit> . the hsps are broadly classified on the basis of their molecular weights and functions into distinct families, with the hsp <dig> family being the best studied and among the most important for cell protection  <cit> . though the heat shock response is a universal phenomenon, various organisms even within the taxonomic groups of relatively low rank  often evolve different strategies to adapt to aggressive environments  <cit> .

the mechanisms providing whole body adaptation of animals to various adverse conditions, including extreme thermal environments, have long attracted the attention of ecologists. after the description of hsps in drosophila and other organisms  <cit> , we undertook systematic studies to establish a possible correlation between the general pattern of hsp synthesis and whole-body adaptation to extreme conditions  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the predominant fraction of investigations on the stress response have largely  been previously performed on a small number of model organisms in the laboratory and, therefore, have limited value in an ecological context. keeping this in mind we usually included in our investigation related species or geographical strains from nature, in particular those inhabiting biotopes or regions with strikingly contrasting average temperatures  <cit> . using this approach, we, as well as other research groups, have accumulated abundant data showing that animals have evolved a variety of strategies to adjust their heat shock systems to changing environmental conditions  <cit> . long-term and large-scale studies of the hsps gene system in species and geographical strains that differ in the temperature of habitats, performed in various laboratories, have disclosed a few basic patterns in the functioning and evolution of this system in organisms living under adverse conditions  <cit> .

in the course of these studies, it was repeatedly demonstrated that noticeable cellular levels of hsps and/or corresponding rna under normal physiological temperatures represent one of the most common adaptations to stressful conditions described in various organisms, including certain species of lizards, flies and ants  <cit> .

in particular, in order to investigate how organisms have evolved to occupy contrasting habitats, we compared four species of stratiomyidae  whose larvae develop in naturally varying aquatic habitats, including highly aggressive conditions of hot volcanic springs  <cit> . previously we have demonstrated that larvae of all these species, independently of their thermal history, show a high level of inducible hsp <dig> under "normal" physiological conditions , and that the level increases only  <dig> -  <dig> fold after a  <dig> minutes heat shock treatment and  <dig> hours of recovery. larvae of these species are able to survive exceptionally heavy heat shock treatments , which are lethal to most of other dipteran species studied so far  <cit> .

we also demonstrated that oxycera pardalina meigen,  <dig>  a stratiomyidae species confined to cold and thermally constant environments, shows the highest relative heat-shock tolerance . whether and how the evolutionary alteration of hsp <dig> expression and thermotolerance among the stratiomyidae species involves changes to the hsp <dig> genes themselves remain unanswered questions.

here we report the results of molecular analyses performed to compare the general arrangements and sequence of hsp70-containing loci in two stratiomyidae species from contrasting thermal environments, o. pardalina and stratiomys singularior harris,  <dig>  for this purpose, we cloned and sequenced member genes of the hsp <dig> gene superfamily from the two species compared.

our studies have demonstrated that the population of s. singularior that inhabits an area with very instable extreme larval habitats and strongly variable conditions, is characterized by a compact hsp <dig> cluster of  <dig> converting hsp <dig> genes. contrastingly, the stable and constantly cold habitat-dwelling o. pardalina exhibits quite different distribution and spacing of hsp <dig> copies in the genome.

RESULTS
general organization of hsp <dig> clusters in s. singularior and o. pardalina
the detailed organization of hsp <dig> genes in s. singularior and o. pardalina emerges from the subcloning and sequencing of overlapping lambda clones isolated from genomic libraries . we have isolated twenty lambda clones from a s. singularior genomic library, and after preliminary restriction analysis have chosen nine clones which apparently contain one or several complete hsp <dig> genes . from these nine phages we have isolated and described four hsp <dig> copies in tandem orientation  and a fifth copy in inverse orientation . genes s <dig> - s <dig> are not identically spaced, and intergenic regions vary: approximately  <dig>  kb between hsp70s <dig> and s <dig>   <dig>  kb between hsp70s <dig> and s <dig>   <dig>  kb between hsp70s <dig> and s <dig>  and  <dig>  kb between hsp70s <dig> and s <dig>  the whole hsp <dig> cluster of s. singularior was sequenced, and surprisingly we failed to detect any significant homology among the intergenic regions between individual hsp <dig> genes.

characteristically, we detected various polymorphisms within the same intergenic regions isolated from individual clones. these polymorphisms include the insertion of a fragment  of mariner transposon in the hsp70s2-hsp70s <dig> intergenic region detected in all four phages containing these genes . furthermore, hsp <dig> copies in s. singularior cluster are subject to gross rearrangement, and although their order in most phages is s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  in phages  <dig> and  <dig> the s <dig> gene is located after s <dig>  while in phage  <dig> an inverted pair is formed by s <dig> and s <dig> genes .

interestingly, we detected deletions in almost all the hsp <dig> intergenic regions. in phage  <dig>  there is a  <dig> kb deletion in the s <dig> - s <dig> region, phage  <dig> contains a  <dig> kb deletion in the hsp70s <dig> - hsp70s <dig> region, and phage  <dig> contains a 2kb deletion in the s <dig> - s <dig> intergenic region. in phage  <dig>  a deletion in the 5'-flank of hsp70s <dig> includes the beginning of the transcribed region and essential heat shock regulatory elements; this deletion may make this hsp70s <dig> allele noninducible .

the general organization of the hsp <dig> genes in o. pardalina characteristically differs from that of s. singularior . preliminary southern blot analysis of eleven lambda clones isolated from o. pardalina genomic dna and carrying hsp <dig> sequences showed that most of the cloned fragments contained only a single hsp <dig> copy . this implies that most hsp <dig> copies in this species, with two prominent exceptions described below, are unlinked or at least located at significantly larger distances from each other than the hsp <dig> genes in s. singularior. we performed a detailed restriction analysis of seven lambda clones isolated from the o. pardalina genomic library, which contained the complete sequences of one or two hsp <dig> family copies ; the other four phages were excluded from the detailed analysis, because they contained only fragments of hsp <dig> genes and did not carry overlapping sequences, judging by cross hybridization with their labeled terminal fragments .

phage b <dig> contains one complete copy of hsp <dig>  and a 5'-fragment of another hsp <dig> copy  in inverse orientation, apparently cut by sau3a in the process of cloning . although we were able to detect two copies of hsp <dig> in inverse orientation in o. pardalina in phage b <dig>  even in this case, the distance between these copies was  <dig>  kb, i.e. four times as large as the correspondent intergenic region between the inverted s <dig> and s <dig> genes in s. singularior . the 5'-flanking regions of all hsp <dig> copies in o. pardalina exhibit extended homology upstream from transcription start , while in s. singularior, 5'-flanking homology in the correspondent intergenic region is evident only within approximately  <dig> bp. this implies that in o. pardalina, the hsp <dig> genes undergo concerted evolution  in blocks containing more than  <dig> bp of 5'-flanking sequences, while in s. singularior concertedly evolving blocks include less than  <dig> bp of 5'-flanking sequences.

in o. pardalina, we observed two hsp <dig> pseudogenes . the pseudogene located in phage b <dig> is 89% homologous to hsp70p <dig> and contains several short deletions resulting in orf shifts. the other pseudogene, isolated from phage  <dig>  is also homologous to hsp70p <dig>  and represents a highly rearranged copy. it contains a long deletion  and inversion  in the coding region of the gene. this pseudogene does not contain the first atg codon. both pseudogenes lack hse elements and fail to exhibit any homology with functional hsp <dig> genes of o. pardalina in the 5'-flanking regions. the o. pardalina hsp <dig> pseudogenes likely arose by retroposition, as suggested for similar duplicated hsp <dig> genes and pseudogenes in drosophila  <cit> . clones  <dig> and 7b contain homologous stretches of dna carrying two tandem copies of genes belonging to the hsp <dig> family, located within a  <dig>  kb interval. interestingly, one copy is the inducible hsp70p <dig>  and the second copy is probably hsp <dig> . this is the first case to our knowledge when hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> genes were found to be so closely linked. therefore, the detailed analysis of genomic libraries enabled us to describe five potentially functional hsp <dig> genes in s. singularior and five genes belonging to the hsp <dig> family, including a presumptive hsp <dig> gene, in o. pardalina. in order to make sure that we cloned and sequenced all or at least most of the hsp <dig> genes from the species compared, we performed a conventional southern blot analysis using genomic dna isolated from both species.

southern analysis of s. singularior and o. pardalina genomic dna
preliminary 3'-race analysis of cdna homologous to heat shock inducible rna isolated from both species based on 3'-utr heterogeneity in general has confirmed our conclusions about the hsp <dig> copy number estimated for both species, and indicates that all hsp <dig> copies isolated with the exception o. pardalina pseudogenes are apparently expressed, i.e. represented in the population of cdna clones sequenced.

sequence analysis of hsp <dig> promoters and regulatory elements in o. pardalina and s. singularior
sequence analysis revealed all components of hsp <dig> regulatory machinery in the 5'-utr regions of most hsp <dig> genes of both species compared. the results of comparing promoter regions in both species are depicted in figure  <dig>  the general structure of the drosophila melanogaster hsp <dig> promoter is given for comparison.

we aligned the promoters of the hsp70s genes separately, since divergence among the genes becomes significant at approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the tata signal . in s. singularior, promoters of individual hsp <dig> genes vary . four candidate heat shock elements  are evident in the promoters of hsp70s <dig> and hsp70s <dig>  in hsp70s <dig>  hsp70s <dig>  and hsp70s <dig>  only three candidate hses are observed. additionally, the promoters of hsp70s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> contain indels and rearrangements. hsp70s <dig> contains a repetitive  <dig> bp insertion upstream of the tata signal that ablates all but the most proximal of the hses . hsp70s <dig> has a similar type of  <dig> bp insertion upstream of the tata signal, flanked by an hsp70s4-derived conversion tract . whether these indels and rearrangements modulate hsp <dig> expression, as has been observed for drosophila hsp <dig> genes  <cit> , remains to be tested. interestingly, in the same phages  we observed gross rearrangements of the whole cluster . the insertions of repetitive dna thus likely represent the footprints of transposable elements responsible for the reshuffling of the hsp <dig> cluster observed in these particular phages. intralocus unequal recombination likely occurred, because the promoter region of gene s <dig> in phage  <dig> is highly homologous to gene s <dig>  including conversion tracts. similarly, the promoter region of gene s <dig> from phages  <dig> and  <dig> is practically identical to that of s <dig>  the sites of presumptive recombination breaks are shown by vertical arrows in figure 1a.

the transcription start point was found to be identical in both species studied . we identified the hsp <dig> transcription start by 5'-race using rna isolated after hs from the larvae of both species, as described in methods.

in all s. singularior hsp <dig> genes, the distance between tata and transcription start point  is  <dig> bp, and the start codon is located  <dig> bp further downstream. in this species, all hsp <dig> tata-boxes are represented by 5'-tatatata-3' nucleotides, and gag or gaga corresponds to the position of the presumptive gaga-factor binding site.

we aligned approximately  <dig> bp of promoter sequence from the four oxycera hsp <dig> genes. these promoters are 93% identical to one another, and each contains four candidate hses in homologous positions ranging from  <dig> -  <dig> to  <dig> -  <dig> bp upstream of the tata signal, which is represented by sequence tataaata .

the promoter of presumptive hsp <dig>  cloned from o. pardalina, also contains a canonical tata-box , several gag sequences, and four hses .

it is evident that essential regulatory elements located in the promoter regions of the two species hsp <dig> genes  vary in number and spacing when comparing between genes and species. in general, the spacing of major regulatory elements  in o. pardalina is more similar to that of d. melanogaster . all the above supports that promoters of both stratiomyidae species studied are functional heat-inducible promoters.

sequence analysis and evolutionary relationships of hsp <dig> transcriptional units in o. pardalina and s. singularior
oxycera pardalina: we recovered the full sequence of one allele for each of the hsp70p <dig>  hsp70p <dig>  and hsp70p <dig> genes. these genes are intronless and contain a  <dig> bp cds.

the three whole cdss are on average  <dig> % identical, diverging by  <dig> -  <dig> silent and  <dig> -  <dig> replacement substitutions . the 5'-utrs of the three intact hsp <dig> genes are  <dig> -  <dig> bp long and 91% identical .

we recovered  <dig> -  <dig> bp of alignable sequence downstream of the three cloned intact hsp <dig> cdss; sequence identity in this region is 77%. in contrast to the near identity of hsp70p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  two hsp <dig> pseudogenes, denoted ψhsp70b <dig> and ψhsp <dig>  bear numerous indels and substitutions and do not encode full-length proteins. the utrs and promoter regions of both pseudogenes were fully sequenced and aligned. however, we found neither potential hse and tata boxes nor any significant homology between these regions .

stratiomys singularior: we sequenced multiple alleles of all five hsp <dig> genes: hsp70s <dig>   <dig> alleles; hsp70s <dig>  2; hsp70s <dig>  4; hsp70s <dig>  2; hsp70s <dig>   <dig>  alleles are named according to the clones from which they were obtained . all alleles contain an intronless,  <dig> bp cds; no pseudogenes were recovered. the cdss are more similar to one another than was seen in o. pardalina; an average of seven fixed differences distinguish any pair of s. singularior hsp <dig> cdss , for an average pairwise identity of  <dig> %. comparing the hsp70s genes to one another via macdonald-kreitman style tests reveals that in all cases, the number of polymorphisms is much greater than the number of fixed differences, and that both polymorphism and divergence are similarly skewed towards silent substitutions . these results are consistent with concerted evolution and purifying selection.

the mechanism of concerted evolution among the hsp70s cdss is likely gene conversion, observed for other insect hsp <dig> genes  <cit> . there are  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms  shared among the hsp70s genes . considering only the silent polymorphisms, to avoid confounding any effects of positive or balancing selection, we examined the probabilities of shared snps arising among the hsp70s genes via independent mutation or gene conversion using the method of rozas and aguade  <cit> . table  <dig> indicates that in all pairwise comparisons of hsp70s genes, we can reject the null hypothesis of independent mutation at p < 10- <dig> 

n, total number of silent sites. ηs, total number of silent mutations. sssnps, number of shared silent single-nucleotide polymorphisms . p, probability of sssnps arising via parallel mutation, estimated from hypergeometric distribution.

we recovered and aligned  <dig> bp of 5'-utr sequence from all the hsp70s genes/alleles whose cdss were completely sequenced, plus one additional allele for each of hsp70s <dig>  hsp70s <dig>  and hsp70s <dig> . only the first  <dig> bp of the hsp70s <dig> 5'-utr could be aligned; the utr is disrupted by large blocks of repetitive sequences upstream of this position, consistent with insertion and/or rearrangement via transposition. whether this rearrangement alters the expression of hsp70s <dig> is unknown. the homogeneity observed in the hsp70s cdss diminishes in the 5'-utrs. the 5'-utrs are 82% identical overall; linkage disequilibrium is higher than in the cdss, and four blocks of linked, polymorphic sites that are shared among genes are strongly suggestive of conversion tracts . seventeen individual snps are shared among multiple genes, again consistent with gene conversion .

the 3'-utrs of the s. singularior hsp <dig> genes are more divergent than those of o. pardalina. in s. singularior the distance of a typical polya signal  from the stop codon, determined by 3'-race, varies from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in individual hsp <dig> copies.

in o. pardalina the position of a candidate polyadenylation signal slightly varies in individual copies of hsp <dig> genes and falls  <dig> -  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon.

as for the 5'-utrs, we sequenced 3'-utrs of more alleles than just those for which we obtained full-length cdss; more than  <dig> alleles of each hsp70s gene 3'-utr were completely sequenced . in contrast to the 5'-utrs, which could all be aligned as one group, we aligned the 3'-utrs of hsp70s <dig>  hsp70s <dig>  and hsp70s <dig> separately for visualization since their shared sequence is less than  <dig> bp long. multiple candidate polyadenylation signals are found in all the 3'-utrs. only hsp70s <dig> and hsp70s <dig> share significant sequence identity. in general, the 3'-utrs vary to a greater extent than both the cdss and 5'-utrs, with sequence identity <80% . hsp70ss <dig> has a deletion eliminating most of the 3'-utr, approximately  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon; the effects of this deletion were not tested but are consistent with rearrangements outside the hsp <dig> cdss observed in the 5'-utr and promoter . only hsp70s <dig> and hsp70s <dig> show evidence of gene conversion in the 3'-utr: in clone  <dig>  hsp70s2's 3'-utr has been converted over at least  <dig> bp to exactly resemble the 3'-utr of hsp70s <dig> . similarly, in clone  <dig>  hsp70s3's 3'-utr has been converted with hsp70s2's. these less frequent, larger, and unbroken conversion tracts, along with the overall higher degrees of divergence among and polymorphism within 3'-utrs, indicate less homogenization via gene conversion. this apparent reduction in conversion is more pronounced than is observed in the 5'-utrs, which show both large tracts and the multiple shared snps indicative of homogenizing gene conversion. the net effect of conversion among cdss with divergence among 3'-utrs is evident in comparative phylogenetic trees . in the cds tree, only hsp70s <dig> resolves as a clade and is supported by a majority of bootstrap trials. in contrast, the 3'-utr tree contains hsp70s <dig>  hsp70s <dig>  and hsp70s <dig> clades, all with strong bootstrap support, and only the wholly-converted hsp70s2/hsp70s <dig> alleles from clones  <dig> and  <dig> prevent the assemblage of hsp70s <dig> and hsp70s <dig> clades. thus, the hsp70s cdss evolve in concert; the 3'-utrs evolve largely independently.

the overall pattern of conversion-mediated homogeneity among hsp <dig> that decays with distance from cds, and polymorphic flanks that contain large indels, is consistent with duplicated hsp70s in drosophila.

inducible proteins encoded by hsp <dig> family genes in s. singularior and o. pardalina
most of the varying sites in hsp <dig> genes of both species are silent and, hence, the deduced hsp70s at amino acid level are highly homologous. thus s. singularior individual hsp70s exhibit almost 97% homology, while their homology with o. pardalina and d. melanogaster hsp70s reaches 93% and 82%, respectively. furthermore, the homology between deduced individual hsp70s of o. pardalina reaches 99%. characteristically, most of the varying sites in both species are localized in the c-domain of hsp <dig>  which is expected based on the above-presented data and the results of other authors showing a higher level of divergence at the 3'-ends of hsp <dig> genes in drosophila  <cit> . the molecular weights of individual s. singularior hsp70s  are  <dig>  -  <dig>  kd and pi  <dig>  -  <dig> .

in order to further characterize hsp <dig> family members in the species compared, we have performed two-dimensional electrophoresis of total proteins from o. pardalina and s. singularior with subsequent immunoblotting with the 7fb antibody, which in d. melanogaster reacts only with inducible hsp70s, and with the  <dig> . <dig> antibody, which reacts with all members of the hsp <dig> family in most diptera species examined including hsp <dig>  <cit> .

the molecular weights of individual o. pardalina hsp <dig> members deduced by vector nti  and pi  vary and practically coincide with the results of 2d electrophoresis of o. pardalina proteins .

the  <dig> . <dig>  but not 7fb, antibody revealed one lower molecular weight protein, which characteristically has a slightly more acidic isoelectric point than the presumptive hsp <dig> . we hypothesized that this particular protein corresponded to d. melanogaster hsp <dig>  importantly, the molecular weight of this protein and pi revealed by 2d  practically coincide with those of hsp <dig> deduced basing on the presumptive hsp <dig> gene sequence located in phage  <dig> and 7b of o. pardalina .

using coomassie stained gels we have isolated spots of expected pi for the hsp <dig> family members and performed fingerprinting and microsequencing analysis as described previously  <cit> . in both species, inducible proteins of interest are represented by a few isoforms, which are well separated on the gel and easy to isolate . after in-gel trypsin digestion and fingerprinting analysis using maldi-tof, the national center for biotechnology information database was searched with the profound search engine. this search has established that as expected the excised  <dig> kda spots in both species correspond to members of the hsp <dig> family previously described in various diptera species .

the predicted hsp <dig> polypeptide of s. singularior and o. pardalina consists of  <dig> a.a. and  <dig> a.a., respectively, and presents all classic hsp <dig> family signatures, including the presence of the serine residue in the atpase domain  that characterizes the inducible hsp <dig> proteins of invertebrates  <cit> . we also detected a few amino acids residues specific for the both stratiomyidae species and other highly thermotolerant organisms e.g. locusta migratoria . conceptual translation showed that stratiomyidae hsp <dig> sequences had 72% identity with human hsp <dig> and  <dig> - 85% identity with d. melanogaster hsp <dig> 

our microsequencing data together with phylogenetic analysis and description of typical hsps promoters enable to conclude that all hsp <dig> genes isolated, with the prominent exception of the two o. pardalina pseudogenes, definitely represent inducible members of hsp <dig> family.

previously we have shown that all four stratiomyidae species exhibit high thermotolerance, correlated with high constitutive cellular levels of hsp <dig>  surprisingly, northern hybridization experiments failed to demonstrate hsp <dig> expression under normal physiological conditions, and only using a highly sensitive rt-pcr technique we were able to detect a very weak leakage of hsp <dig> genes in the species studied  <cit> . surprisingly, the accumulation of hsps in the cells of these species after heat shock challenge continues for many hours after hs treatment and, therefore, inducible hsp70s in these species are probably more stable in comparison with drosophila and many other diptera species  <cit> . based on these data, it was of significant interest to compare the amino acid sequence of stratiomyidae hsp70s with the sequence of hsp70s isolated from other animals. the results of this analysis are shown in figure  <dig> 

roughly, the dendrogram reflects the accepted phylogenetic relationships between the taxa included  <cit> , with some deviations. in figure  <dig>  species of stratiomyidae  form a separate cluster, as well as all species of another suborder, cyclorrhapha , with one exception, bactrocera oleae . these two branches were clustered together. contrastingly, members of the "more primitive" suborder nematocera  have the much lower similarity to other diptera; formally, they were grouped with the cluster  and did not form a separate cluster .

interestingly, heat shock proteins  from both stratiomyidae species grouped with paralogous sequences from several insect species including the ones known to be highly thermotolerant such as bombyx mori  <cit> , locusta migratoria  <cit>  and drosophila mojavensis  <cit> . however, although even a few mammalian hsp70s were included into the tree, it is premature to speculate on any functional relatedness of these proteins because such speculation will require the inclusion and analysis of many more sequences.

discussion
in this paper we investigated the structure and general arrangement of hsp <dig> genes from two stratiomyidae species from strikingly contrasting habitats.

according to field observations and measurements, s. singularior has highly variable and instable larval habitats in the arid steppe zone of the crimea. strong changes in the shore larval habitats of s. singularior were observed since  <dig> to  <dig>  both within the season and between the years. these changes were related mostly to hydrological regime, i.e. varying precipitation and the water level of the lakes. generally, in the periods of the higher water table, many larval habitats were flooded or strongly influenced by hypersaline lake water . the decreasing water level of the lake coincided with a decrease of mineralization ; in these periods, the respective habitats were moistened mostly with groundwater of lower salinity. it should be also mentioned that the abundance of s. singularior larvae varied greatly along the shoreline and between the habitats. in favorable places, e.g. in some groundwater-fed pools above the lake water margin, the larvae reached high abundance , but typically, they were completely absent or found only as single individuals along the most part of the shore.

it seems that in the study area, s. singularior is represented by a number of micropopulations mostly confined to some shore localities, which may be at a distance of several km from each other. many of these favorable breeding places are temporary and completely dry out in drier and warmer years. however, in this case adult flies are able to cover the distance of several kilometers easily in search of new places for oviposition.

therefore, our preliminary observations on the crimean larval habitats of s. singularior testify to a variability in the conditions between the habitats, strong variation of conditions within the habitats occurring with time, together with the temporary nature of many habitats and their possible isolation from each other. all these features may result in a high polymorphism of hsp <dig> demonstrated in this particular species.

we demonstrated a high level of polymorphism by southern blot hybridization with genomic dna digests, depending on the number of the larvae taken for analysis . furthermore, sequencing of several phages containing the same hsp <dig> genes revealed polymorphism in the intergenic regions including long deletions. in a few cases we detected deletions of entire individual hsp <dig> genes , likely a result of unequal recombination.

these deletions may result from an evolutionary trend to make the hsp <dig> cluster in this species more compact. previously we have described more compact organization of the hsp <dig> genes cluster in a more thermotolerant low-latitude species drosophila virilis in comparison with the closely related higher-latitude d. lummei from the temperate climatic zone  <cit>  and, therefore, the observed deletions may represent certain pattern. alternatively, the deletions described in s. singularior may be due to a high overall rate of dna loss in this species, a phenomenon previously demonstrated for two drosophila species  <cit> .

in contrast to the s. singularior biotope, the studied larval habitat of o. pardalina - a cold spring near st. petersburg observed from  <dig> to  <dig> - was very stable in mineralization, temperature, water regime, and in other major conditions both within season and interannually. this spring and headwater stream seems to be an island habitat for the o. pardalina population. another similar habitat is situated at about  <dig> km, and it is unlikely that o. pardalina adults migrate regularly between these localities. the abundance of larvae is not high, not exceeding  <dig> -  <dig> individuals per m <dig> of semiaquatic shore substrate . thus, habitats of the two species differ dramatically from each other not only in the average parameters such as temperature and mineralization, but also in the spatial organization and in the degree of variability in time.

therefore, in the case of the latter species we have a comparatively small and probably highly homozygous population. southern blot hybridization analysis  did not reveal any polymorphisms in o. pardalina hsp <dig> genes and, hence, confirms this conclusion. furthermore, individual phages containing the same fragments of dna did not exhibit any polymorphisms either in coding or in intergenic regions of the same hsp <dig> genes. since these phages were isolated from two independently obtained genomic libraries they cannot contain the same dna but rather likely represent highly homologous sibs.

previously, when we investigated inbred laboratory strains of d. virilis and d. lummei, we also demonstrated apparent identity of the overlapping hsp70-containing clones, which is typical for highly homozygous strains  <cit> .

in spite of strikingly different habitats, the larvae of all stratiomyidae species studied have very high tolerance to elevated temperature in comparison with most of other diptera species investigated  <cit> . furthermore, although tolerances were in general correlated with the typical habitat temperatures of the species, even o. pardalina larvae inhabiting cold springs with constant temperature regime , significantly exceeded all drosophila species in tolerance and exhibited a huge gap between the natural temperatures  and the critical temperature .

importantly, larvae of all four stratiomyidae species investigated have exhibited high constitutive levels of hsp <dig> proteins which are induced only  <dig> - 3-fold after temperature elevation  <cit> . in this respect, stratiomyidae species resemble locusta migratoria, an insect species adapted to arid tropical and subtropical climate, where temperature frequently exceeded 40°c  <cit> .

additionally, in contrast to drosophila, the accumulation of hsp <dig> continues in the cells of the treated larvae of all stratiomyidae species investigated for many hours after heat shock and plateaus only approximately  <dig> -  <dig> h after the treatment  <cit> .

the results obtained may be explained by constitutive weak transcription  of hsp <dig> genes under normal physiological conditions, and possibly by comparatively higher stability of hsps in stratiomyidae species in comparison with other insect species studied.

in order to further characterize the molecular basis underlying this pattern of hsp <dig> expression and differences in thermotolerance in the stratiomyidae and other diptera, as well as between the stratiomyidae species, we compared the general arrangement of hsp <dig> genes clusters of the two stratiomyidae species from thermally different habitats. surprisingly, the analysis revealed quite different organization of hsp <dig> genes in the two species compared.

although the hsp <dig> copy number does not differ significantly between less tolerant o. pardalina and more thermotolerant s. singularior, the general organization of hsp <dig> genes is divergent in these two species. while in s. singularior all hsp <dig> genes are confined to one genomic section of about  <dig> kb in length, in o. pardalina most of hsp <dig> genes are scattered in the genome and apparently located rather far from each other if linked at all. however, in both species we have found two hsp <dig> copies in an inverted orientation   <cit> . furthermore, in o. pardalina we cloned a fragment carrying one copy of inducible hsp <dig> and one copy of presumptive hsp <dig> gene in tandem orientation separated by only  <dig>  kb.

previously we described two hsp <dig> copies in inverted orientation in species of the virilis group of drosophila  <cit> . we speculated that hsp <dig> in these species arose by duplication of a basic unit of hsp <dig> genes typically arranged in diptera species in inverted orientation. however, in the virilis group species hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> are located in the same chromosome but are separated by a large distance  <cit> . presumptive hsp <dig> gene of o. pardalina is closely linked to hsp <dig> gene  and exhibits higher homology with hsp <dig> genes of this species than with hsp <dig> genes from other diptera species . these data enable us to suggest that o. pardalina hsp <dig> also represents a duplication of hsp <dig> gene. at the present time we can not discriminate between two hypotheses explaining the appearance of hsp <dig>  the appearance of the hsp <dig> by duplication of hsp <dig> may occur very early in diptera evolution and predate the split of drosophilidae and stratiomyidae. alternatively hsp <dig> may appear independently in the evolution of drosophila and stratiomyidae and acquire similar functions and structure by convergence.

it is noteworthy that even for the genes located in inverted orientation, which apparently represents the primitive state of hsp <dig> in diptera, the distance between the inverted copies in o. pardalina is four times as large as between the inverted copies in s. singularior .

the different spacing of hsp <dig> genes in the species compared may resemble different abilities of their genome to efficiently respond to stress. the homogenized coding sequences and highly compact organization of hsp70s in s. singularior may be necessary for fast and efficient transcriptional response and thereby thermotolerance of the larvae to extreme and rapidly changing conditions of the environment.

on the other hand, o. pardalina inhabiting cold running waters with comparatively stable thermal conditions may not require such tight hsp <dig> cluster organization and, hence, underwent dispersal and pseudogenization of a few hsp <dig> copies in the process of evolution. two hsp <dig> pseudogenes detected in the genome of this species in our studies may represent the remains of previously active genes. previously we have shown that larvae of o. pardalina produce significantly less hsp <dig> in response to heat shock in comparison with all other stratiomyidae species investigated  <cit> . the observed drastic differences in the organization of hsp <dig> genes in s. singularior and o. pardalina may account for the differences in the thermotolerance and hsp <dig> levels after hs treatment observed between these species.

furthermore, hse <dig> of o. pardalina is not canonical and contains only two  <dig> bp units. therefore, the first canonical element  in o. pardalina is located at significantly larger distance from the transcription start than in s. singularior . the differences in the number of canonical hses and their spacing may also contribute to different activity of hsp <dig> genes in the two species  <cit>  and explain why o. pardalina exhibits lower thermotolerance in comparison with all other stratiomyidae species studied so far  <cit> .

it is also evident from figure  <dig> that in the case of o. pardalina, the arrangement of promoter regions of all hsp <dig> genes is practically identical, while in the case of s. singularior the promoters of all members of hsp <dig> cluster differ significantly. these differences result from fine tuning of an hsp <dig> "battery" necessary for adaptation of the latter species to highly variable environmental conditions. therefore, our results indicate that o. pardalina hsp <dig> genes may be locally adapted, whereas higher hsp <dig> polymorphism may have important evolutionary consequences for s. singularior.

the evolution of hsp <dig> genes in the species compared is quite different in many respects. the mk tests demonstrate that the divergence between individual s. singularior hsp <dig> genes is very low, especially considering the age of the duplications. this is consistent with concerted evolution in this species, and also strikingly different from the divergence between paralogs in o. pardalina . in all cases, the number of shared polymorphisms between s. singularior hsp <dig> genes is highly unlikely to have occurred via parallel mutation . the presence of multiple conversion-mediated shared snps and large conversion tracts in the alleles of the same hsp <dig> members support gene conversion as a mechanism of concerted evolution  among duplicated hsp <dig> genes of s. singularior species  <cit> .

the overall pattern of conversion-mediated homogeneity among hsp <dig> genes in s. singularior that decays with distance from cds, and polymorphic flanks that contain large indels, is consistent with previously described duplicated hsp70s in drosophila  <cit> . we cannot exclude the occurrence of gene conversion in o. pardalina, because in this species we did not isolate multiple alleles of individual hsp <dig> genes. however, since the level of fixed differences between hsp <dig> genes in o. pardalina is several fold higher than in s. singularior , one may conclude that in the former species the conversion process is less efficient if present at all. the large distances between individual hsp <dig> genes in o. pardalina genome likely decrease the frequency of their conversion  <cit> . whether the large distances also decrease their coordinate expression is an interesting question.

several authors justly outlined many logical and statistical problems associated with using two-species comparison for studying adaptations  <cit> , and we are well aware that unless similar correlation is obtained for other stratiomyidae species or geographical populations, any generalizations are premature. however, a similar pattern of hsp <dig> organization has been previously described when studying two closely-related species of the virilis group of drosophila, which replace one another along a latitudinal cline  <cit> . the less thermotolerant high-latitude species d. lummei, similar to o. pardalina, exhibits several-fold larger distance between tandemly arranged hsp <dig> copies in the cluster, in comparison with the closely-related more tolerant low-latitude d. virilis  <cit> . interestingly, along these lines one of the hsp <dig> copies described in d. lummei was shown to be a nonfunctional pseudogene lacking the first  <dig> nucleotides of coding sequence. similarly, two likely nonfunctional pseudogenes have been described in the present study in the less thermotolerant o. pardalina. dispersed genomic arrangement is not absolutely required for hsp <dig> degeneration. the tight hsp <dig> clusters of the tropical island endemic d. mauritiana segregate multiple pseudogenes, although in this case a founder effect rather than relaxation of selection may modulate hsp <dig> pseudogene frequencies  <cit> . in spite of the approximately identical hsp <dig> copy number in stratiomyidae and drosophila virilis group species, there are several clear-cut differences in the organization and evolution of hsp <dig> cluster between these phyla. in species of the virilis group, not only the hsp <dig> transcriptional units but also the 3'-flanking sequences are highly conserved within d. virilis and between d. lummei and d. virilis. thus, the 3'-flanking sequence of several d. virilis hsp <dig> genes is near identical for more than  <dig> bp. such an arrangement suggests tandem duplication of hsp <dig> copies by unequal crossing over in the course of drosophila species evolution  <cit> .

in contrast, our analysis detected only short, varying length regions of significant homology in the intergenic regions in s. singularior hsp <dig> cluster. similarly, we detected only  <dig> bp of significant homology in the intergenic regions located at the vicinity of 5'-ends of hsp <dig> genes in o. pardalina.

at the present time, we can only speculate concerning the molecular mechanisms which may underlie the different arrangement of hsp <dig> genes in the species studied, although the pattern of compactness and conversion in s. singularior vs. dispersion and divergence in o. pardalina is clear. several large deletions in s. singularior, including those spanning entire individual hsp <dig> genes, may be indicative of an evolutionary trend towards compactness to provide a highly coordinate response to the changing environmental conditions. the deletions may also be a consequence of conversion; the more homogenized the individual hsp <dig> units, the more likely they are also to participate in unequal crossover. on the other hand, the dispersed arrangement and interlocus divergence of hsp <dig> copies in o. pardalina may result from long-range recombination and relaxed selection on hsp <dig> sequences in a species living in very stable thermal conditions.

the analysis of hsp <dig> arrangement in other species and natural populations of stratiomyidae and related taxa  should help to further evaluate the evolution of hsp <dig> genes in the ecological context.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolution of hsp <dig> genes in the species compared is quite different in many respects.

although the hsp <dig> copy number does not differ significantly between less tolerant o. pardalina and more thermotolerant s. singularior, the general organization of hsp <dig> genes is divergent in these two species. while in s. singularior all hsp <dig> genes are confined to one genomic section of about  <dig> kb in length, in o. pardalina most of hsp <dig> genes are scattered in the genome and apparently located rather far from each if linked at all. however, in both species we have found two hsp <dig> copies in an inverted orientation, which represents a fundamental and probably ancient hsp <dig> gene unit. the divergence between individual s. singularior hsp <dig> genes is very low, especially considering the age of the duplications. this is consistent with concerted evolution in this species, and also strikingly different from the divergence between paralogs in o. pardalina. the observed drastic differences in the organization of hsp <dig> genes in s. singularior and o. pardalina may contribute to the differences in the thermotolerance between these species, and thus recapitulate the history of their thermal adaptation.
