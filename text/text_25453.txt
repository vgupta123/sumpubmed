BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile has emerged over the past decade to become the most common cause of infectious antibiotic-associated diarrhea within healthcare systems worldwide  <cit> . this gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium commonly resides asymptomatically in healthy individuals who can serve as a transmission reservoir within a hospital setting  <cit> . the emergence of c. difficile virulence is linked to the acquisition of multiple resistance determinants to commonly used antibiotics  <cit>  allowing this pathogen to thrive in the intestines of patients following antibiotic treatment  <cit> . c. difficile can produce a number of potent virulence-associated factors that contribute to intestinal colonization and disease  <cit> , and facilitate the establishment of a pathological imbalance within the resident microbiota  <cit> . unlike many other healthcare pathogens, c. difficile produces highly resistant and transmissible spores and, as a consequence, creates significant challenges to infection control and environmental decontamination protocols  <cit> .

sporulation is a complex developmental program leading to the generation of metabolically dormant spores from vegetative cells  <cit> . spo0a is a transcription factor that is active in the early stages of sporulation in c. difficile and other sporulating bacteria  <cit> . orthologues of spo0a are encoded by a variety of the firmicutes  <cit> , including bacillus and clostridium, and the genetic inactivation of this gene leads to a non-sporulating phenotype  <cit> . in the well studied clostridium and bacillus organisms, many of the pleiotropic effects of spo0a are due to indirect regulation via the transition state regulator abrb  <cit> . however, c. difficile does not encode an abrb orthologue highlighting differences in spo0a activity between c. difficile and other clostridium and bacillus species studied to date  <cit> . c. difficile spo0a binds directly to dna upstream of several early sporulation genes  <cit>  but this transcriptional regulator may also control other processes not obviously associated with sporulation. for example, in c. difficile spo0a has also been implicated in controlling toxin gene expression  <cit>  and disease in mice  <cit>  and biofilm formation in vitro <cit> .

consequently, we performed a genome-wide analysis to define spo0a regulated genes within c. difficile using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach. our analysis demonstrates that the c. difficile spo0a gene encodes a global transcriptional regulator that coordinates an array of phenotypes associated with host colonization and transmission. the rich breadth of our functional data allowed us to make significant updates to the annotation of the c. difficile  <dig> reference genome.

RESULTS
c. difficile growth dynamics in vitro
we and others  <cit>  have previously demonstrated that c. difficile 630Δerm produces spores and that an isogenic spo0a::ermb mutant does not, but that sporulation can be restored by expressing the spo0a gene in trans <cit> . here we confirm this phenotype in wilson’s broth supplemented with glucose  <cit>  and show that c. difficile 630Δerm and the spo0a mutant displayed comparable growth kinetics under these culture conditions with shaking  which allows for more reproducible growth compared to cultures grown statically  <cit> . interestingly, we found that the sporulation program was active primarily during exponential phase, leading to an increase in the formation of ethanol resistant spores at the transition into stationary growth phase. we observed no discernable increase in spores during stationary phase . during mid-exponential stage approximately  <dig> in  <dig>  cells  and during late-exponential approximately  <dig> in  <dig>  cells  were ethanol-resistant spores . the growth conditions used in our study are not optimized for sporulation, as we wished to obtain a broad picture of spo0a dependent transcriptional effects, rather than identifying the spo0a-dependent sporulation program. as a result, the observed spore levels are lower than achieved with other growth conditions  <cit> .

western blot analysis using c. difficile spo0a-specific antibodies demonstrated that spo0a was produced during both exponential and stationary growth by c. difficile 630Δerm but not a spo0a mutant derivative . given our interest in defining the genes controlled by c. difficile spo0a and the potential links between sporulation and other phenotypes we chose to focus on mid-exponentially growing c. difficile  for subsequent experiments.

functional enrichment of the c. difficile  <dig> genome annotation with transcriptomics and proteomics
to survey and compare the global transcriptomes of c. difficile 630Δerm and the spo0a mutant we performed high-density, strand-specific cdna sequencing  of rna extracted from exponentially growing cultures and mapped the sequence data to the c. difficile  <dig> genome  <cit> . next we normalised the mean abundance of reads per gene  and identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed  in the spo0a mutant, of which  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated compared to c. difficile 630Δerm . genes whose expression was influenced by spo0a  were evenly distributed around the genome and were encoded on both the forward and reverse strands .

we also performed comparative proteomic analysis on the same c. difficile cultures to complement the rnaseq dataset. proteins were extracted from the same samples used for rna analysis and separated on sds-page followed by in-gel digestion and peptide extraction. to compare protein levels, the generated peptides were labeled with dimethyl stable isotope labels and mixed prior to mass spectrometry analysis. peptide identification and quantitation were assigned using maxquant software. using a 1% false discovery rate  we identified polypeptide products corresponding to  <dig> genes. notably, the proteomic analysis showed better coverage for abundant proteins and a higher proportion of cytoplasmic compared to membrane or secreted proteins . we found  <dig> proteins that were differentially regulated by a log <dig> fold change, of which  <dig> proteins were decreased and  <dig> increased in relative abundance in the spo0a mutant derivative compared to c. difficile 630Δerm. a strong correlation was observed  between the transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. a detailed break down of each dataset into function class as well as the intersection of the trancriptomic and proteomic analysis datasets are given as a searchable excel file in additional file  <dig> 

our combined transcriptomic and proteomic dataset comparing the 630Δerm and the spo0a mutant derivatives provided a unique opportunity to enrich the current genome annotation of the reference c. difficile  <dig>  particularly for those genes that were previously annotated as “conserved hypothetical” based on in silico predictions  <cit> . this study represents the largest functional analysis of the reference c. difficile  <dig> genome since its creation in  <dig>  <cit>  and builds upon previous annotation updates  <cit>  by validation of the implicated genes that is not possible by in silico methods.

the improved annotation described here is primarily based on the presence of differentially expressed genes in the rnaseq and proteomic datasets  or the mature spore proteome  <cit>  datasets . for those genes implicated in the experimental dataset that did not have a known functional product, in silico annotation was undertaken to predict a function. this utilised searches on nucleotide and amino acid sequences of homologous genes and prediction of protein family and domain sites with the pfam database  <cit>  and prosite database  <cit>  in addition to identifying subcellular localisation of proteins using signalp  <cit>  and thmmm  <cit> . this process was also complemented by literature searches relating to the functional characterisation of the genes and their products in question. a feature of any annotated genome is that it is current only at the time it was created. in light of this in silico annotation as described above was also performed on all genes without a known product that were not present in the experimental dataset.

the initial annotation of the c. difficile  <dig> genome characterised genes by functional classes adapted from the riley class system  <cit>  . for brevity some classes have been collapsed into broader functional descriptions. the number of genes in most functional classes has increased since that original annotation  <cit>  . the notable exceptions are the classes ‘fatty acid biosynthesis’ , a decrease of  <dig>  and ‘cell envelope’ , a decrease of  <dig>  genes previously in class  <dig> . <dig> have now transferred to a wide range of different functional classes including ‘cell processes’ , ‘sporulation’ , ‘extrachromosomal’  and ‘conserved hypothetical’  reflecting transitions between functional classes based on more accurate annotation tools and increasing numbers of c. difficile genomic studies.

correspondingly the functional classes characterising genes of an unknown or a putative function i.e. ‘hypothetical’ , ‘conserved hypothetical’  and ‘uncharacterised’ , have all decreased in number except for class  <dig> . <dig>  however  <dig> of these genes were not identified in the initial  <dig> annotation  and a further  <dig> were initially part of class  <dig> . <dig> and have been moved to class  <dig> . <dig> representing annotation studies on subsequent c. difficile strains. as a result, there are now only  <dig> genes in class  <dig> . <dig> .

in total  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the spo0a rnaseq, spo0a proteome or the mature spore proteome datasets representing 17% of the entire c. difficile  <dig> gene content.  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes that previously were classified as  <dig> . <dig> or  <dig> . <dig> now have a known function, these include  <dig> spore coat associated genes: cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and cd <dig>   <cit> . the presence of  <dig> genes in the experimental dataset that previously resided in class  <dig> . <dig> are now updated to class  <dig> . <dig> confirming their expression. interestingly,  <dig> genes that were previously classified as pseudogenes due to the presence of frameshifts or mobile genetic elements have been changed to functioning genes based on their presence in the experimental dataset.  <dig> of these  are interrupted by istrons. the ability of the istron to be excised from the mrna transcript and not interfere with gene functionality  <cit>  is corroborated by the presence of these genes in the experimental dataset.

in silico annotation of genes in classes  <dig> . <dig>   <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> that were not present in the experimental dataset also resulted in considerable improvements to the elucidation of gene products.  <dig> genes previously contained in these classes are now in a known functional class. the classification of  <dig> more genes has improved from class  <dig> . <dig> to class  <dig> . <dig>  in addition to this a further  <dig> genes , previously classified as pseudogenes due to been interrupted by istrons have been restored to functional genes. all of these improvements are representative of a broad range of functional classes.

now  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes in the c. difficile  <dig> genome have either a known or putative function or experimental evidence confirming the gene is expressed. other significant improvements to the annotation include the re-classification of sigk  as a functional gene; the presence of the skin prophage-like element which interrupts the gene is not detrimental to gene functionality due to controlled excision  <cit> .

in addition to identifying gene products, gene nomenclatures have been updated where possible. gene nomenclatures for  <dig> of the cell wall proteins   <cit>  have been added as well as the cationic peptide resistance cluster cpra,b,c and its regulators cprr and cprk <cit> . gene names for the extra cytoplasmic sigma factors csfu,v,t and the associated anti-sigma factors rsiu,v,t which are involved in sensing and responding to extracellular stresses  <cit>  have also been added. finally, duplicate gene names have been resolved where appropriate by the addition of a number or letter.

the annotation has been updated on the main genomic sequence repositories  and the embl file can also be accessed at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/clostridium-difficile.html which contains all of the functional class annotations described here. subsequent analysis in this manuscript was performed using the newly annotated c. difficile  <dig> genome.

genome-wide functional classification of the spo0a regulated genes
the differentially expressed genes identified by transcriptomics and proteomics were assigned into functional classes based on a modified version of the riley system  <cit>  . our analysis indicated that spo0a regulates genes representing a broad array of functional classes , although there was an enrichment of certain classes . for example, of the  <dig> genes in the sporulation/germination functional class,  <dig> genes were positively regulated by spo0a, that is, their expression was attenuated in the spo0a mutant, whereas no genes in this class were relatively upregulated . gene classes comparatively downregulated in the spo0a mutant include those assigned to the functional classes transport/binding , metabolism , cell-envelope architecture  and gene regulation  . in contrast, genes linked to the functional classes chemotaxis/mobility , transport/binding , metabolism , cell-envelope architecture  and gene regulation  were upregulated in the spo0a mutant relative to the parental strain .

several genes that were previously shown to harbor a consensus spo0a binding site upstream of their coding sequences  <cit>  were differentially regulated in the spo0a mutant at the transcript or protein level. for instance, spo0a binds to the upstream region of ssua, which shows significantly lower rna and protein levels in the spo0a mutant compared to wild type . similarly, the putative direct target lpla shows increased levels of rna and protein. thus, these genes are likely direct targets of spo0a in c. difficile. we found that many genes with altered transcript levels do not contain a consensus spo0a binding motif  <cit> . these may either reflect regulation through a non-consensus spo0a-binding motif, or indirect regulation. it is noteworthy that several putative transcriptional regulators show changes in transcript levels  and strong spo0a dependent regulation without the presence of a clear spo0a binding site has previously been noted for clostridium acetobutylicum <cit> .

overall, these data indicate the c. difficile spo0a directly and indirectly regulates a diverse set of genes potentially linked to different phenotypes beyond sporulation.

spo0a positively regulates the sporulation cascade
our analysis of the c. difficile spo0a-asssociated sporulation pathway was guided by an abundance of knowledge available for the sporulation pathway in b. subtilis <cit> . c. difficile  <dig> encodes a number of orthologues for genes such as cody, sinr and scoc that regulate the earliest stages of sporulation in b. subtilis upstream of spo0a. neither cody nor scoc genes are under the control of spo0a . however, the sinr gene was upregulated in the c. difficile spo0a mutant, indicating negative regulation by spo0a, similar to b. subtilis <cit>  . c. difficile  <dig> does not harbour orthologues of the spo0a phosphorelay proteins of b. subtilis that lead to spo0a phosphorylation. however, others have suggested that one or more orphan histidine kinases of c. difficile can directly or indirectly affect spo0a activation  <cit>  and two of these genes encoding potential kinases, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  are differentially expressed in the spo0a mutant versus wild type cells  .

phosphorylation of spo0a leads to the activation of a sigma factor cascade that acts in both mother cell and forespore  and many of the early stage b. subtilis sporulation proteins are highly conserved in c. difficile  <dig> genome, including the sporulation specific sigma factors sigh, sigf, sigg, sige, siga <dig> and sigk  <cit> . we found that spo0a influenced the expression of the sige, sigg, sigf and siga <dig> genes that were relatively under represented in the spo0a mutant. taken together, these data suggest that in c. difficile spo0a positively controls the expression of sigf, sigg, siga <dig> and sige during the early stages of sporulation .

our data indicates that the role of spo0a in regulating the formation of endospores is relatively conserved between b. subtilis and c. difficile. however, based on genomic and proteomic comparisons the later stages  of sporulation appear to be less conserved. we found the three transcriptional units encoding early sporulation genes previously predicted to be direct targets of spo0a in c. difficile <cit> , spoiiaa-ab-ac/sigf, spoiiga-sigg-sige and spoiie, were under represented in the spo0a mutant. the list of significantly affected genes also includes sige-dependent genes, such as spoiiid and the spoiiiaa-ah operon. of all of these stage ii and iii genes in the spo0a regulon, only sigg is found in the mature spore .

it should be noted that our analysis did not identify many of the conserved later-stage iv and v genes  <cit>  as differentially expressed in the spo0a mutant, likely due to the growth conditions. many of these are controlled by the late sporulation sigma factor sigk, and consistent with this we observed no effect of a spo0a mutation on sigk transcription under our experimental conditions. the exceptions are spoiva, spovd, cspba-cspc and sipl which are under control of sige  <cit> . we also identified the genes encoding the subtilisin like protease cspba  <cit> , the germinant receptor cspc  <cit> , and the spore morphogenetic protein sipl  <cit>  as differentially expressed in the spo0a mutant.

spo0a regulates colonization and virulence genes
our analysis revealed that distinct functional classes linked to c. difficile virulence and colonization are under control of spo0a. consistent with our previous studies  <cit> , the toxin gene tcda was significantly upregulated in the c. difficile spo0a mutant . we could not identify a consensus ‘0a’ binding box upstream of the tcda start site and in vitro binding assays did not indicate that tcda was a direct target of spo0a  <cit> . thus, spo0a appears to indirectly control tcda gene expression, perhaps via one of the many other factors that control toxin gene expression  <cit> . our analyses were carried out on cells in exponential growth phase, where toxin expression is lower compared to stationary growth phase  <cit> . this may in part explain the fact that the tcdb gene , several of which are implicated in intestinal adherence, colonisation or subversion of the hosts’ immune system. for example, six genes encoding surface proteins showed altered transcription in the spo0a mutant; cwp <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> are upregulated in the spo0a mutant whereas cwp <dig>  cwp <dig> and cwp <dig> are all downregulated. two of these, cd <dig> and cd <dig> possess adherence-associated domains while the remaining four  encode members of the cell wall protein family  <cit> . several genes implicated in remodeling of the cell wall are also regulated by spo0a. for example, upps <dig> encodes an undecaprenyl-pryophosphate synthase responsible for synthesizing a cell wall carbohydrate lipid precursor, and is downregulated in the spo0a mutant. two genes in the dlt alanylation operon, dlta and dltb, were significantly upregulated in the spo0a mutant. these later two genes are located within a four-gene operon involved in the esterification of teichoic acid or lipoteichoic acid with d-alanine, conferring resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

in c. difficile  <dig>  components of the flagellar assembly apparatus are encoded by two loci that are divided by an inter-flagellar locus that has been implicated in flagellin glycosylation. fourteen genes encoding flagellar proteins  and the four transcripts  that constitute the inter-flagellar glycosylation locus  <cit>  were relatively upregulated in the spo0a mutant at the mrna level . however, the differences in expression of the flagella structural genes were not reflected in the proteomic data and this is likely due to loss of the flagella from bacterial cells during sample preparation.

we could not identify a consensus spo0a binding motifs immediately upstream of the spo0a-affected cell membrane/wall associated genes, with the exception of putative cd0241- <dig> operon  <cit> . this indicates that the majority of the effects of spo0a on this class of genes are either mediated by degenerate motifs or indirectly via one or more of the spo0a-affected transcriptional regulators .

to validate these observations we examined c. difficile 630Δerm and the isogenic spo0a mutant for the presence of peritrichous flagella by negative staining and tem. we consistently observed no cell-anchored flagella on the parental c. difficile 630Δerm . however, the spo0a mutant displayed a striking hyper-flagellate phenotype with an average of  <dig>  flagella/bacterium  . complementation with a plasmid-borne copy of spo0a partially restored the phenotype and reduced the average number of flagella to  <dig>  per bacterium  . together these results demonstrate a role of spo0a in negatively controlling c. difficile flagella production.

c. difficile spo0a is a positive regulator of butyrate biosynthesis
spo0a positively regulates several regulatory genes predicted to be involved in carbohydrate uptake and metabolism . for example,  <dig> separate bglg-type genes involved in carbohydrate sensing and transcriptional anti-termination are downregulated in a spo0a mutant, and  <dig> transcriptional regulators are downregulated in the spo0a mutant, most of which are predicted to respond to nutrients and extracellular cues . further, several membrane-associated transporters of the phosphotransferase system  with predicted specificity for beta-glucoside  are downregulated in the spo0a mutant . key genes from the glycolysis pathway that convert glucose to pyruvate were downregulated in the spo0a mutant, including the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase , the central glycolytic genes regulator  and putative 6-phospho-alpha- and beta-glucosidases .

glucose fermentation can lead to the production of a variety of metabolic by-products including butyrate . interestingly, we found that the entire butyrate production operon  <cit>  was downregulated in the c. difficile spo0a mutant at both the mrna and protein levels , including butyryl-coa dehydrogenase , electron transfer flavoprotein β-subunit , electron transfer flavoprotein α-subunit , 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydratase , 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase  and acetyl-coa acetyltransferase . figure  <dig> illustrates a proposed biochemical pathway for glucose uptake and fermentation highlighting in red those genes under positive control of spo0a. key components of this butyrate production pathway are also present in the c. difficile  <dig> spore proteome  <cit> , suggesting a possible association between butyrate and spore formation and/or germination in c. difficile. none of the genes listed above harbor a consensus spo0a binding site in their immediate upstream region. interestingly, ptb and buk, encoding a phosphate butyryltransferase and a butyrate kinase, respectively, were upregulated in the spo0a mutant at the mrna level. these two genes are potentially directly regulated by spo0a; the upstream region of ptb contains a spo0a box  <cit>  and the buk gene likely forms an operon with ptb.

to determine which of these transcriptional responses dominates the butyrate biosynthetic pathway we measured butyrate from exponentially growing c. difficile 630Δerm and the spo0a mutant. we found that the c. difficile spo0a mutant produced significantly less butyrate than the parental 630Δerm . moreover, the spo0a mutant complemented in trans with a plasmid borne spo0a gene produced levels of butyrate that were statistically comparable with the 630Δerm parental strain . thus, overall c. difficile spo0a positively controls butyrate production, likely via an indirect mechanism.

discussion
c. difficile spo0a is generally considered a transcriptional regulator of sporulation although recent reports have suggested additional roles in toxin gene regulation in vitro <cit>  and intestinal colonization and disease in mice  <cit> . here we demonstrate an unappreciated role for c. difficile spo0a as a global transcriptional regulator of colonization, virulence, sporulation and metabolic phenotypes. thus, spo0a influences all aspects of the c. difficile infection cycle allowing the bacterium to adapt to changing environments experienced during infection and host-transmission. the wide array of phenotypic defects in the c. difficile spo0a mutant would explain our previous results demonstrating that the c. difficile spo0a gene is required for persistent colonization and disease in mice  <cit> .

spo0a is a transcriptional regulator that is activated via phosphorylation from a cognate membrane-associated sensor histidine kinase in response to an environmental cue. underwood et al. <cit>  demonstrated that the histidine kinase cd <dig> can potentially serve as a phosphorylation donor for c. difficile spo0a and proposed that other histidine kinases  may also interact with spo0a suggesting multiple environmental inputs. the environmental cues that lead to c. difficile spo0a phosphorylation remain unknown but we predict such cues to be mainly present within the mammalian intestinal tract when c. difficile is metabolically active. further, we propose such environmental cues influence an array of physiological states and phenotypes during the complete c. difficile lifecycle since spo0a is present in the mature spore  <cit>  and during all stages of vegetative growth  <cit> .

c. difficile sporulation in the laboratory seems to occur asynchronously  <cit> . though our sampling timepoint likely covers multiple growth stages, we cannot exclude the possibility that specific early or late timepoint-specific effects of spo0a are missed in our analyses. indeed, as a result of our choice of timepoint, late sporulation genes are underrepresented in our study. however, several studies have specifically addressed the role of spo0a and the downstream sporulation specific sigma factors in the sporulation program  <cit> . our genome and proteome analysis provides an excellent starting point to discriminate genes under direct or indirect control of spo0a in c. difficile. we find that spo0a affects the expression of several regulators , suggesting that many of the observed effects may be indirect. future research will focus on defining those environmental cues and associated histidine kinases that lead to spo0a phosphorylation and the downstream genes that are under direct control of spo0a-p to delineate the c. difficile spo0a regulon.

our study defined spo0a-dependent gene expression patterns and phenotypes that allow us to speculate on c. difficile’s lifestyle within the intestinal tract. for example, spo0a negatively regulates the sporulation cascade and surface proteins proposed to promote host interactions  in addition to negatively regulating virulence factor expression . perhaps during sporulation c. difficile downregulates some virulence and motility functions to avoid host surveillance while adhering to the mucosal surface. indeed, we routinely observe c. difficile sporulating on the mucosal surface within the murine intestinal tract  <cit> . spo0a also coordinates shifts in nutrient transporters and metabolic pathways perhaps in response to the available nutrients on the mucosal surface such as complex and simple carbohydrates within the mucus layer overlying the intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . spo0a also positively regulates butyrate production, a significant energy source for intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , potentially representing a metabolic link between c. difficile and the host to promote mucosal adherence. it is of note that several of the genes and programs identified in our study were also found to be spo0a dependent in c. acetobutylicum <cit> , suggesting that these are conserved and physiologically relevant patterns.

even though we linked c. difficile spo0a to distinct physiological states and phenotypes the vast majority of genes misregulated in a c. difficile spo0a mutant are of putative or hypothetical function due to the lack of knowledge about c. difficile biology and host interactions. the rich breadth of transcriptome and proteome data provided a unique opportunity to perform a significant functional annotation to the c. difficile  <dig> reference genome. with the recent description of genetic mutagenesis methods  <cit>  and murine infection models  <cit>  the updated genome annotation will facilitate studies into c. difficile colonization, disease and transmission.

CONCLUSIONS
the c. difficile spo0a gene is a global transcriptional regulator that controls diverse sporulation, virulence and metabolic phenotypes coordinating pathogen adaptation to a wide range of host interactions. additionally, the rich breadth of functional data allowed us to significantly update the annotation of the c. difficile  <dig> reference genome which will facilitate basic and applied research on this emerging pathogen.
