BACKGROUND
estrogen exerts various biological effects in numerous organs throughout the body and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases including breast cancer, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disorders. most of the estrogenic effects are mediated via the two known estrogen receptors, erα and erβ. these estrogen receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that can modulate gene transcription directly but also indirectly. thus far, there is a relative paucity in the description of the role of estrogen and estrogen receptors in specific organs. most studies have been performed using non-tissue specific manipulation of er signaling such as complete knockouts either via deletion of the estrogen receptor or via deletion of estrogen production by ovariectomy. the availability of tools to specifically address the role of er signaling in individual tissues would thus fill a void.

short synthetic duplexes of  <dig> nucleotides long rna molecules can specifically inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells  <cit> . because of their efficacy and specificity, sirna molecules provide a powerful tool to dissect gene function. to expand the applicability of the sirna approach, brummelkamp and co-workers  <cit>  have introduced vector-based sirna expression systems. by directing the synthesis of shrna via the polymerase-iii h <dig> rna gene promoter, effective sirna molecules are formed intracellular after transfection of shrna expression constructs. to further expand the applicability of the sirna approach, recombinant retro- and adenoviral based vectors have been designed  <cit> . of these, adenoviral vectors offer the advantage of highly efficient infection of a broad range of cells, independent of active cell division. moreover, high titers can be obtained and intravenous injection results in efficient transduction of the liver.

the present study was designed to generate tools to address the role of erα in a tissue- and time- specific manner. to this end, we have developed recombinant ad vectors encoding shrna's directed against mouse erα . introduction of sherα, either by transfection or by ad mediated gene transfer into different murine cell lines, led to efficient sequence specific repression of er mediated transcription. furthermore, intravenously administration of ad.sherα resulted in efficient reduction of hepatic erα mrna levels  and erα functionality.

RESULTS
efficient and specific knock-down of endogenous merα in vitro: transfection with psuper-sherα constructs
three psuper-derived vectors  <cit>  designed to drive expression sherα sequences were constructed. two vectors contained sh sequences derived from the boundary of the dna binding domain and the hinge region , or from the ligand binding domain  of merα, respectively. a third expression vector contained both the sherα_ <dig> and sherα_ <dig> expression cassettes in series .

the efficiency of the sherα constructs for reducing endogenous erα activity in vitro was determined using a luciferase reporter assay. for this purpose, the psuper-sherα_ <dig>  psuper-sherα_ <dig>  or psuper-sherα_tandem were transfected together with a reporter plasmid carrying a trimer of ere plus tata box upstream of luciferase  into endothelial cell lines  and in mouse breast cancer cells . as shown in figure 1a, upon transfection with sherα_ <dig>  relative luciferase activity in lysates of all three cell lines was reduced by 70–80%. a similar result was obtained with sherα_ <dig> in eoma's. in addition, the sherα_tandem expression construct proved to be more efficient than either of single sherα contructs alone in the eoma cells, adding some 15% to the 70% reduction observed with sherα_ <dig> .

to evaluate the specificity of the sherα construct, sherα_ <dig> was introduced into eoma cells over-expressing either mouse erα or human erα. the erα_ <dig> target sequence contains only a single mismatch with the human erα . significant suppression of erα mediated transcription was only observed in lysates of cells that were transfected with mouse erα but not with human erα . thus, the observed effects of sherα_ <dig> are specific for mouse erα. moreover, changing a single nucleotide in sherα_ <dig> completely abolished the silencing effect . by western blotting, the effect of sherα on erα protein expression was studied . in the presence of sherα_ <dig>  erα protein levels were reduced to 33% as compared to control transfected cells. this reduction correlated well with our findings in the luciferase reporter assay. thus, the observed inhibition of luciferase activity upon treatment with sherα_ <dig> or sherα_ <dig> is caused by reduced accumulation of merα protein. all together, the sherα_ <dig> and sherα_ <dig> expression vectors are effective and specific in repression of murine erα expression.

knock-down of hepatic erα expression in vivo: using ad.sherα vectors
to repress erα activity in vivo, ad vectors expressing either sherα_ <dig> , sherα_ <dig>  or both  were generated . the h <dig> rna promoter plus sherα expression cassettes were sub-cloned from the corresponding psuper into padtrack  <cit> , which is engineered to co-express gfp enabling the tracking of infected cells. in addition, we constructed a control adtrack plasmid, carrying only the h <dig> rna promoter, which allowed for the generation of ad.empty. prior to the evaluation of recombinant ad vectors in vivo, we tested the functionality of the vectors in vitro. eoma and mxt cells were transfected with pere-luc, and subsequently infected with ad.empty or the ad.sherα vectors. fluorescence analysis indicated a near 100% infection percentage. the luciferase experiments  were comparable to those obtained with transfection of the psuper constructs : both ad.sherα vectors repressed luciferase reporter activity up to 90%. thus, ad.sherα vectors were found to be fully functional with respect to repression of merα activity.

we then proceeded with the application of our vectors in vivo. the ad vectors  were injected in the tail vain of c57bl/ <dig> mice. this allowed examination of inhibition by sherα of endogenous hepatic merα. four days post-injection, animals were sacrificed, and the livers were studied for gfp expression and erα mrna level. similar gfp expression patterns were observed in all groups, indicating equally efficient transduction . erα mrna levels were studied by real time pcr analysis . administration of ad.sherα_ <dig> reduced erα mrna levels 70%, whereas hepatic expression of sherα_tandem resulted in an 85% reduction.

subsequently, we sought to examine the extent of sherα-mediated repression of hepatic merα transcription activity. for this purpose, we constructed an ad vector carrying the estrogen responsive luciferase reporter gene . first the estrogen-responsiveness of this vector was determined in vivo . five days post-injection of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu ad.ere-luc, the mice were injected s.c with increasing concentrations of estrogen, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/kg. as shown in fig  <dig>   <dig> hours post-injection, estrogen induced hepatic luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. maximal stimulation was reached after applying  <dig> μg/kg estrogen. then, we determined to what extend ad.sherα down-regulates the transcriptional activity of hepatic erα. ad.sherα together with ad.ere-luc reporter vector was administrated intravenously to c57bi/ <dig> mice. luciferase expression was detected by a ccd camera in living mice. without estrogen treatment, all mice exhibited the same basal expression of the reporter construct . administration of  <dig> μg/kg estrogen, three and seven days after transduction with ad.sherα_ <dig>  resulted in a significant repression of hepatic erα-mediated luciferase activity . these data were confirmed by measuring luciferase activity in liver extracts of mice that received estrogen  five days post-injection with ad.ere-luc plus ad.empty or ad.sherα_ <dig> .

we conclude that ad-mediated introduction of sherα in vivo results in an almost complete repression of hepatic merα mrna levels, as well as merα-mediated transcription activity.

discussion
in this paper, we demonstrate that efficient silencing of mouse erα can be achieved in vitro as well as in vivo by use of ad-mediated transfer of shrna molecules that target the erα mrna. two independent sherα plasmid and ad vector expression constructs were generated and shown to be effective in repressing endogenous erα activity up to 80% in several different cell lines and in vivo . in addition, a construct was made expressing both sherα sequences simultaneously. in vitro as well as in vivo, this construct was shown to be more effective  than either of the two sherα constructs alone. non-invasive optical imaging of living mice, allowed us to quantify sherα activity in vivo. significant reduction of mouse erα transcription levels were observed up to seven days post-transduction .

thus far, bystander effects caused by shrna constructs targeted to an unrelated gene have not been reported, and the specificity of the sherα_ <dig> construct was verified by the observation that human erα, which has a single mismatch with the murine erα target sequence, is not down-regulated . the number of mismatches with the murine erβ sequence totals five, making it unlikely that the sherα_ <dig> construct would affect expression of erβ. similarly, the sherα_ <dig> construct has three mismatches with the human erα and nine mismatches with murine erβ, making it unlikely that the sherα_ <dig> construct would interfere with either of them. a single mismatch in the sherα_ <dig> sequence did render the construct ineffective in down-regulating murine erα . thus, the two independent sherα constructs described here are exquisitely suited to demonstrate that a specific effect is mediated by down-regulation of erα expression and not by down-regulation of a related sequence.

a key challenge in the application of an shrna based approach is efficient delivery of the shrna constructs to target cells in vitro and in vivo. for application of shrna in vivo, the sh oligopair, driven by h <dig> rna polymerase  <cit>  or u <dig> promoter  <cit> , can be cloned in viral vectors. here, the ad vector was chosen as delivery vector, because of the relative ease of generation and amplification. moreover, the natural tropism of ad vectors for the liver enables the rapid analysis of the hepatic knock-down phenotype. since ad vectors predominantly infect the parenchymal cells  <cit> , it is important to note that most abundant hepatic erα expression was detected in parenchymal cells while erα expression was barely detected in hepatic endothelial cells or kupffer cells . this supported the rationale for application of sherα ad vectors in vivo. another interesting observation was that upon administration of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu ad.sherα, an 85% reduction of erα mrna levels was obtained , whereas co-injection of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu ad.sherα_ <dig> with  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu ad.ere-luc resulted in an almost complete absence of luciferase activity . the ratio of ad.ere-luc versus ad.sherα_ <dig>  should ensure that all cells that were transduced by ad.ere-luc also received ad.sherα_ <dig>  thus, the remainder of erα expression determined by real-time pcr likely reflects erα expression in non-parenchymal and non-infected cells.

thus far, relative few reports describe the application of ad vectors as delivery system for rnai in vitro  <cit> . similarly, relative few studies on effective rna interference in vivo using ad mediated gene transfer have been reported  <cit> . one potential explanation for this relative paucity in the application of ad mediated gene transfer for shrna expression constructs could lie in the recent observations of lu and cullen  <cit> , that va <dig> non-coding rna, expressed by wild type adenovirus is a potent inhibitor of rna interference. however, replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors such as the vectors used in our study have been reported to express low levels of va <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in our hands the effect of the psuper shrna construct sherα_ <dig> on reduction of erα activity in vitro was not affected by super-infection with the ad.empty vector . thus, the ad vectors applied in this study seem to have no or a minor inhibitory effect on the rnai response in vitro and in vivo. whether this effect is also insert specific and/or depends on the particular target gene remains to be investigated.

the strongest evidence for efficient reduction of endogenous hepatic erα rna levels in vivo was obtained by co-injection of ad.ere-luc and advanced non-invasive in vivo optical imaging. administration of ad.ere-luc led to readily detectable levels of luciferase activity from day  <dig> up to day  <dig> and disappeared at day  <dig> . in agreement with this, the ad.shera mediated knock-down effect was present at day three, five, and seven post-injection . this represents a  <dig> to 5-day window of expression to determine the phenotypic effects of hepatic shrna-mediated reduction of mrna levels.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown significant repression of hepatic erα activity in mice utilizing ad.sherα vectors. in addition, using advanced non-invasive optical imaging technology, the dynamics of the knock-down effect in vivo have been demonstrated. thus, our data confirm that application of shrna represents a powerful tool for targeted gene silencing. we conclude that ad-mediated delivery of sherα constructs represents an elegant tool to gain more insight in the role of the hepatic erα.
