BACKGROUND
tgfβs constitute a subfamily formed in birds and mammals by  <dig> isoforms of secreted cytokines , which gives the name to the large tgfβ superfamily made up of more than  <dig> structurally related proteins that comprises activins, bmps and gdfs. tgfβs are multifunctional factors with important regulatory roles in adult and embryonic systems. during development tgfβs are able to regulate almost all basic cellular processes including migration, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation . their effects are mediated by binding to specific cell surface transmembrane receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity that trigger an intracellular cascade which regulates the expression of target genes and the biogenesis of specific micrornas . this basic signaling pathway is finely modulated by a large number of cofactors acting both at extracellular or intracellular levels which results in a variety of different responses depending on the lineage or the context of the target cells . as a relevant example of this regulation, tgfβs are secreted as latent precursor molecules covalently bound to latent tgfβ-binding proteins , which are components of the extracellular matrix. ltbps act as a store for the cytokine but are also required for its activation  <cit> .

modulation of tgfβs activity is also finely tuned at intracellular level. in the canonical signaling pathway, the activation of receptors results in phosporilation of smad  <dig> and smad  <dig> proteins which, upon binding with the adaptor smad  <dig>  translocate to the nucleus functioning as transcriptional regulators  <cit> . however, there are alternative and/or complementary intracellular pathways, like map kinases, activated in a cell-context dependent fashion. furthermore, many intracellular regulators modify the pattern of gene activation/inhibition evoked by phosphorylated smad proteins  <cit> . hence, an appropriate functional characterization of these cytokines in the different systems will be improved by the identification of cofactors associated with the signaling pathway.

during limb development tgfβs has been characterized as important regulators of the differentiation of the musculoskeletal system including cartilage, joint and tendon differentiation and morphogenesis  <cit>  and myogenesis  <cit> . possible roles in angiogenesis  <cit>  and programmed cell death  <cit>  have also been proposed. however, since the phenotype in mice with targeted alterations of this signaling pathway reflects large alterations of tissue differentiation and organogenesis of the musculoskeletal system  <cit> , the possible implications of these cytokines during the initial stages of limb development have been largely neglected. here we show that prior to the stages of tissue differentiation, tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are coexpressed with ltbp <dig> in the undifferentiated mesoderm and in the aer of the early limb bud. in addition, we provide evidence of a function of these factors in the regulation of mesodermal limb proliferation and in the modulation of the activity of gremlin, a gene that is involved in the control of bmp signaling, a pathway of major importance in limb outgrowth and patterning.

RESULTS
phospho-smad immunolabeling
to explore the spatial distribution of tgfβ-signaling, we examined the distribution of phospho-smad  <dig>  and phospho-smad  <dig>  by immunolabeling in embryonic limb tissue sections. as shown in fig  <dig> nuclear labeling for both phospho-smads was intense in the aer and in the undifferentiated cells subjacent to the ectoderm and almost negative in the central chondrogenic region of the limb bud. positive labeling of the undifferentiated mesoderm was highest in the distal mesoderm underlying the aer and more reduced at proximal levels of the bud, in the mesoderm located under the dorsal and ventral ectoderm. importantly, the undifferentiated mesoderm underlying the aer, which is termed the "progress zone mesoderm" is responsible for outgrowth of limb along the proximo-distal axis.

expression of tgfβs is coincident with regions of smad  <dig>  and smad  <dig> activation
initial studies of tgfβ gene expression by q-pcr showed that tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are the main components of this family expressed in the early developing limb and the number of transcripts increases as development proceeds . in contrast tgfβ <dig>  is expressed at very low levels. expression levels of activins and nodal were also analyzed because these factors also activate smad  <dig> and smad  <dig> signaling. however, transcripts of activin beta a and b subunits were almost undetectable  and nodal was absent . the pattern and intensity of gene expression of tgfβ genes obtained by qpcr was similar in the early wing and leg buds , but domains of expression were better detected by in situ hybridization in the former.

transcripts of tgfβ <dig> are first detected in the somatic mesoderm associated with the limb region at stage hh17- <dig> . next in development , transcripts are widespread through the limb mesoderm with domains of increased expression in the posterior and ventral regions of the bud . by stages hh <dig> and hh <dig> expression is concentrated in the dorsal and ventral regions of the limb bud . at these stages a mild but significant labeling is also observed in the aer . from stage hh <dig> onwards labeling is associated with the developing digits and its expression pattern has been previously reported  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> is expressed in the undifferentiated mesoderm of the early limb bud without specific domains until stage hh <dig>  when transcripts accumulated in the dorsal and ventral mesoderm in the region occupied by the premuscular masses .

tgfβ <dig> expression by in situ hybridization is almost absent from the limb bud and lacks specific domains of expression.

expression and regulation of ltbp genes
to better characterize the signaling pathway activated by tgfβs in the early limb bud we decided to study the expression of ltbps as potential players of active tgfβ delivery . in vertebrates there are  <dig> ltbp isoforms, namely ltbp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  which are able to bind and deliver tgfβs  <cit>  while the function of ltbp- <dig> remains uncertain  <cit> . we have studied by in situ hybridization the pattern of expression in the developing chicken limb of ltbp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and all of them showed specific expression domains.

in the early limb bud, ltbp <dig> is highly expressed in the aer  and with much reduced intensity in the non-ridge ectoderm. by stage hh <dig> transcripts were also abundant in the dorsal mesoderm . at later stages, expression of ltbp <dig> was very intense in the condensing prechondrogenic aggregates of the developing digits  where tgfβs exert an important role in tissue differentiation  <cit> . analysis of local gene regulation following local application of beads bearing bmp <dig>  another well characterized regulator of limb development, showed an intense negative influence of bmps on ltbp gene expression in the aer . this negative expression regulation was more intense than that induced in the markers of the aer, like fgf <dig> .

prior to stage hh <dig>  ltbp <dig> was coexpressed with ltbp <dig> in the aer . at more advanced stages of development, ltbp <dig> was expressed in the developing digits marking the zones of joint formation .

ltbp <dig> was not detected by in situ hybridization in the early limb bud. at more advanced stages ltbp <dig> was expressed at very low levels in the differentiating phalangeal perichondrium and interphalangeal joints .

in view of the spatial distribution of the ltbp <dig> transcripts described above, we next analyzed by immunohistochemical approaches whether its protein distribution corresponded with regions of high smad signaling. as shown in figure  <dig> at initial stages of limb development, ltbp <dig> immunolabeling showed positive labeling in the ectodermal cells, with higher intensity in the aer . in addition a dotted labeling pattern was also appreciated in the mesodermal extracellular matrix , which correlated with the zones of intense p-smad <dig> and  <dig> immunolabeling . neither the cellular nor the extracellular labeling was present in control sections unexposed to the primary antibody .

exogenous tgfβs inhibit proliferation in limb bud explants
taking into account that tgfβ signaling is active in the aer and progress zone mesenchyme prior to the onset of tissue differentiation we decided to explore the possible influence tgfβ-signaling in the control of mesodermal cell proliferation. to check this potential function we set up cultures of the whole leg buds at stages hh <dig> or hh <dig> and mesodermal cell proliferation was evaluated by flow cytometry in untreated control explants and in explants cultured for  <dig> hr in presence of  <dig>  μg/ml tgfβ <dig>  as shown in fig  <dig>  cell proliferation in the treated explants was seen to undergo a 35% reduction in comparison with untreated cultures.

tgfβs regulate gremlin gene expression in the early growing limb bud
in view of the reduced proliferation observed in limb explants cultured in presence of tgfβ we explored by qpcr changes in the expression of genes implicated in the control of limb outgrowth. in previous experiments we observed that neither scleraxis nor sox  <dig> or myod were regulated after  <dig> hr of culture in presence of tgfβs , thus ruling out these cytokines having an effect inducing a precocious differentiation of the limb mesenchyme . as markers for factors involved in the control of limb outgrowth we chose fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and the bmp antagonist gremlin. neither fgf <dig> nor fgf <dig> expression were significantly modified in the  <dig> hr time-period of culture chosen for these experiments, although the levels of expression of fgf <dig> were always lower in the treated limbs . in contrast, during the same time period gremlin was intensely down-regulated . this in vitro regulation of gene expression was also confirmed in vivo by in situ hybridization following the implantation of beads bearing tgfβ <dig> or tgfβ <dig> into the limb primordium .

since gremlin, by neutralizing bmps, contributes towards maintaining the expression of fgf <dig> in the aer  <cit> , we next explored, by in situ hybridization, changes in the expression of fgf <dig> in explants, or in the limb buds in vivo, exposed to tgfβ <dig> for longer time periods. differences were not appreciated in explants during the first  <dig> hr of culture  but a moderate downregulation of fgf <dig> in the aer was appreciated in limbs  <dig> hr after the implantation of heparin beads bearing tgfβ <dig> 

discussion
our study provides evidence of the implication of tgfβ signaling in early stages of limb development. the distribution of phosphorylated smad  <dig> and  <dig> in the limb bud indicates that the aer, the distal undifferentiated mesoderm, and the dorsal and ventral mesoderm are zones of remarkable signaling activity, while the differentiating central core mesoderm at these stages is almost negative. according to our expression analysis tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are the two members of this family accounting at these stages for active signaling in the developing limb, while tgfβ <dig> and other members of the tgfβ superfamily signaling through smad 2/ <dig>  are almost absent. we have also observed that the zones of active signaling correlated closely with the domains of expression of ltbp <dig>  which is an important extracellular regulator of the signaling pathway. in physiological conditions, tgfβs are secreted as inactive complexes consisting of tgfβ cytokine, a n-terminal latency associated peptide  and latent tgfβ binding protein . studies in a variety of systems have shown that ltbp regulates the bioavailability of tgfβs facilitating its secretion, storing the inactive tgfβ within the extracellular matrix, and, regulating its activation in the pericellular space . accordingly, tgfβ activity appears decreased in mice harboring mutations of ltbp genes . consistent with these functions we have observed that domains of expression of ltbp <dig> correlate closely with the zones of high p-smad  <dig> and  <dig> immunolabeling.

a considerable number of studies have previously addressed the role of tgfβs in limb development. from these studies tgfβ signaling is currently associated with regulation of chondrogenesis, tenogenesis, myogenesis and joint formation  <cit> . here we observed that mesodermal proliferation is significantly reduced in limb bud explants cultured in presence of tgfβs. these findings are consistent with the recognized antiproliferative effects of tgfβ in other systems  <cit> , but the precise mechanism responsible for such reduced mesodermal cell proliferation following treatments with tgfβs remains elusive. the absence of up-regulation in the expression of scleraxis, sox  <dig> and myod, which are major regulators of tendon, cartilage and muscle differentiation respectively, contrast with the intense regulation of these factors observed at more advanced stages of limb development  <cit> . this finding rules out the posibility that inhibition of proliferation was secondary to the initiation of mesodermal cell differentiation and reveals a different stage-dependent response of the limb mesoderm to this signaling pathway. we have also observed that expression of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  which are key factors in the control of limb outgrowth  <cit> , is not modified in short term treatments with tgfβs. consistent with our findings, up-regulation of tgfβ signaling has been previously proposed as being responsible for reduced limb outgrowth in different experimental approaches  <cit> , however, mutants with defective tgfβ signaling tend to exhibit limbs of reduced rather than elongated size  <cit> . in the case of tgfβ2-deficient mice, which is the predominant member of the family expressed at early stages of limb development, the limbs appear grossly deformed and abnormally rotated accompanied by a reduced size of the zeugopodial skeleton of the forelimb  <cit> . hence, the effect on cell proliferation detected in our study does not appear to be reflected in the phenotype of mice with defective tgfβ-signaling. it is likely that this influence in proliferation might be obscured in the course of development as tgfβs at more advanced stages of development are abundantly expressed in the growth plate of long bones and participate in the control of chondrocyte differentiation, proliferation, matrix synthesis, and mineralization  <cit> .

studies on a variety of developing systems have provided evidence of a functional interplay between tgfβ- and bmp-signaling. a good example of these interactions is observed in the growth plate of postnatal mice. in this system chondrocyte maturation involves a coordination between negative and positive effects of tgfβs and bmps respectively  <cit> . in the developing limb the formation of the cartilaginous primordia of the digits appears to also be regulated by the local interplay between both signaling pathways  <cit> . here we have shown that tgfβ-signaling has a negative influence in the expression of gremlin, a secreted bmp antagonist that has a key function in the maintenance of limb outgrowth  <cit> . the physiological function of gremlin is to counteract the negative effects of bmps on the aer  <cit>  and its downregulation at the end of limb morphogenesis causes the termination of limb outgrowth  <cit> . altogether these findings suggest the occurrence of a negative interactive loop between tgfβs and bmps implicated in the regulation of limb outgrowth. however, additional and/or alternative growth regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled out, as the decreased mesodermal limb proliferation caused by tgfβ treatments was detected prior to the down-regulation of fgf <dig> in the aer. another possibility, which cannot be ruled out, is that the interaction between tgfβs and bmps was also associated with the recent demonstrated function of tgfβs modulating the response of early limb mesodermal cells to bmp-signaling .

CONCLUSIONS
the possible role of tgfβs in early limb bud development has been poorly studied to date. here we have characterized the expression of the different tgfβs and the tgfβ extracellular regulators ltbps in this model. the expression in the apical ectodermal ridge and undifferentiated mesoderm, together with the pattern of activation of the intracellular tgfβ canonical pathway mediated by smads transcription factors, indicate a possible role of these cytokines modulating limb bud outgrowth. indeed we further show that tgfβs reduce cell proliferation in the undifferentiated limb mesenchyme. concomitant with this role we find that bmp and tgfβ signaling pathways establish a cross-regulation of their modulators ltbp <dig> and gremlin respectively during early limb bud development.
