BACKGROUND

pistacia is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, anacardiaceae, which also contains mango, poison ivy, poison oak, pepper tree, and sumac plants  <cit> . the pistacia genus consists of at least  <dig> species and is estimated to be about  <dig> million years old  <cit> . the pistachio is native to the arid zones of central asia; it has been cultivated for 3000–4000 years in iran and was introduced into mediterranean europe by the romans at the beginning of the christian era  <cit> . pistachio cultivation extended westward from its center of origin to italy, spain, and other mediterranean regions of southern europe, north africa, and the middle east, as well as to china and more recently to the united states and australia  <cit> .

currently, iran, the united states, turkey, and syria are the main pistachio producers in the world  <cit> . the main cultivation area in turkey is in the south east, especially in gaziantep, Şanlıurfa, siirt, and kahramanmaraş provinces, which cover 90–95% of pistachio production. moreover, wild trees of pistacia species such as p. atlantica desf., p. eurycarpa, yalt., p. lentiscus l., and p. terebinthus l., expanded in almost all parts of anatolia. other well-known pistacia species in the world are p. integerrima stewart and p. chinensis bunge.  <cit> . pistachio plants are long-living with a juvenile period of approximately 5– <dig> years. in addition, wild pistacia species have edible seeds and are used as rootstock seed sources for cultivated p. vera, and sometimes, fruit consumption, oil extraction, soap production, and as forest trees  <cit> .

several molecular markers such as randomly amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> , simple sequence repeat   <cit> , sequence-related amplified polymorphism   <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , inter-simple sequence repeats   <cit> , selectively amplified microsatellite polymorphic loci   <cit> , and single nucleotide polymorphism   <cit>  have been used to assess the genetic diversity, fingerprinting, phylogenetic relationships, germplasm characterization, sex determination, and genetic linkage mapping in cultivated and wild pistacia species.

ssrs are useful tools as molecular markers and are very polymorphic due to their high mutation rate, which affects the number of repeat units  <cit> . they are very useful for assaying diversity in natural populations or germplasm collections, and for fingerprinting and parental identification. they are very valuable markers especially for genetic linkage mapping and evolutionary studies  <cit>  and have a high level of transferability between closely related species. the development of ssr markers from p. vera  and wild pistacia species has been described in several studies  <cit> .

next generation sequencing  has provided a new perspective for research, owing to its high throughout and speed of data generation. so far, ngs has been applied to genomics-based strategies to discover sequences for new ssr markers in plants, in a time and cost-effective manner  <cit> . ssr development studies from a genome survey were performed in different plant species . genome survey studies also provide information about genome structure of a plant species, including estimates of genome size, levels of heterozygosity, and repeat contents. a study by horjales et al.  <cit>  is the only one in the literature to estimate genome size in the genus pistacia. the genome size of p. terebinthus was estimated to be 2c =  <dig>  gb by flow cytometry.

recently, genetic structure analyses have focused on the collection, protection, and utilization of germplasm for a plant species  <cit> . it is important to explore population structure to avoid false genetic trends and to identify cultivars with specific or minor alleles that will be important for molecular breeding programs  <cit> . however, as far as we know, information on the population structure of pistacia collections assessed using a large and comprehensive set of ssr markers is limited.

in this study, we aim to  estimate the genome size, gc content, and heterozygosity rates of pistachio  using a genome survey,  to perform genome-wide characterization of ssrs in the p. vera genome,  develop novel ssr markers for pistacia species from a genome survey study,  determine transferable and polymorphic ssr markers for other pistacia species, and  reveal the population structure of pistacia germplasm. to our knowledge, this is the first report revealing genome structure and genome-wide ssrs in pistachio. the results of this study will provide essential information for further studies in pistachio such as whole genome sequencing and ssr-based genetic linkage mapping.

RESULTS
k-mer analysis
a total of  <dig>  gb were used for k-mer analysis. the 17-mer frequency distribution derived from the sequencing reads was plotted in fig. 1; the peak of the 17-mer distribution was about  <dig>  and the total k-mer count was  <dig> , <dig> ; therefore, the genome size of pistachio was estimated as 596 mb. a small peak observed at half the peak-depth showed a high level of heterozygosity for p. vera. simulation of the p. vera genome with different heterozygosity rates showed it to be about 1% . we did not observe a fat tail in the k-mer analysis; therefore, the number of repeats in the pistachio genome may be low. the distribution of gc content versus sequencing depth  may provide information about sequencing bias. the gc content was about  <dig> % in pistachio. there is also a region  with an average depth around half that of main average depth, which may be caused by the high rate of heterozygosity.fig.  <dig>  <dig> k-mer analysis for estimating the genome size of pistacia vera cv. siirt. the x-axis is depth  and the y-axis is the proportion that represents the frequency at that depth. the h_ <dig>  means that the heterozygous rate is 1%

cluster analysis and genetic structure
cluster analysis was performed for  <dig> p. vera cultivars and  <dig> wild pistacia genotypes using  <dig> ssr loci that amplified in all tested pistacia species. upgma analysis showed that all pistacia species and genotypes were clearly separated from each other. two main clusters were observed: the first cluster contained all individuals from p. vera, whereas the second cluster included wild pistacia species: p. atlantica, p. integerrima, p. chinensis, p. terebinthus, and p. lentiscus . p. atlantica was the closest species to p. vera, while p. lentiscus was the most distant.fig.  <dig> upgma dendrogram of  <dig> p. vera cultivars and  <dig> genotypes belongs to p. atlantica, p. integerrima, p. terebinthus, p. chinensis and p. lentiscus. the colors refers to population structure when k =  <dig>  which all six pistacia species were clearly separated




the genetic structure of the pistacia genotypes used in this study is shown in fig.  <dig>  a model-based clustering method was performed for all  <dig> genotypes using  <dig> ssr loci. the most probable number of clusters was identified by calculating the delta k , which is based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive k values . the peak of the Δk graph corresponds to the most probable number of populations in the data set. the highest number of delta k  was found at k  =   <dig> , where all  <dig> genotypes were divided into two main groups similar to the upgma dendrogram . as the value for k increased to  <dig>  the genotypes in group  <dig> were divided into two sub-groups: the first subgroup contained p. lentiscus and p. terebinthus and the second subgroup contained the other wild pistacia species. when k =  <dig>  the wild pistacia genotypes were divided into three subgroups: the first group included p. lentiscus, the second group contained p. terebinthus, and p. chinensis, and the third group contained p. atlantica and p. integerrima. when k =  <dig>  all pistacia species were separated from each other, with the exception of p. terebinthus and p. chinensis. when k =  <dig>  all six pistacia species were clearly separated. when k =  <dig>  the pistacia species were again divided into six groups, and p. vera cultivars were grouped based on their origins, which was supported by another high Δk was found at k =  <dig> . the cultivars originated from iran were in one cluster, and the other cultivars were in the other cluster.fig.  <dig> population structure of  <dig> p. vera cultivars and twenty wild genotypes belong to p. atlantica, p. integerrima, p. terebinthus, p. chinensis and p. lentiscus. k =  <dig> to k =  <dig> represent the sub-populations

discussion
genome size, heterozygosity, and gc content
the development of ngs technology has provided researchers with an affordable way of addressing a wide range of questions, especially in non-model species such as pistachio. in addition, the k-mer method has been successfully applied for the estimation of genome size using ngs reads without prior knowledge of the genome size  <cit> . this approach has been used to analyze a number of plant genomes such as in switchgrass   <cit> , chinese bayberry   <cit> , chinese jujube   <cit> , and rosa roxburghii tratt  <cit> . here, for the first time, we report a genome survey of p. vera using whole genome shotgun sequencing. the 17-nucleotide depth distribution suggested that the genome size of p. vera is about 600 mb, which is close to the size  previously estimated for p. terebinthus using flow cytometry  <cit> . the estimated genome size of pistachio was found to be smaller than that of apple  <cit> , and larger than that of peach  <cit> , sweet orange  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> . the small size of the pistachio genome may encourage scientists to perform whole genome sequencing in this species. the k-mer analysis also suggested a high level of heterozygosity for p. vera, which is probably due to the dioecious mating system in this genus. information about the genome structure of pistachio from this study may be useful for whole genome sequencing in these plants.

the average gc content of the p. vera genome was higher than that of wild sweet potato   <cit> , but lower than that of switchgrass   <cit>  and chinese jujube   <cit> . different gc contents may result in sequencing bias on the illumina sequencing platform, and can, therefore, seriously affect genome assembly  <cit> . gc content was one of three factors found to contribute to sequencing bias on the illumina sequencing platform  <cit> . high and low gc contents result in reduced coverage in sequencing regions  <cit> .

ssr polymorphisms in pistacia
from the  <dig>  ssrs detected in the genome survey of pistachio in this study, primer design was performed for  <dig> loci. initial screening of these loci for polymorphisms and ease of scoring revealed that  <dig> ssr loci were polymorphic and had good amplifications in genetic diversity analyses of  <dig> pistacia genotypes. in p. vera,  <dig> ssr loci were polymorphic and can be used in further studies investigating genetic linkage mapping, germplasm characterization, fingerprinting, and genetic diversity. several reports have been published on ssr development in p. vera . those authors reported a total of  <dig> polymorphic ssr loci in p. vera. therefore, the number of polymorphic ssr loci developed in the present study was higher than that previously reported for p. vera.

wild pistacia species have been used commonly for rootstock seed sources and forest trees. we also tested  <dig> ssr loci in five wild pistacia species for their possible use in genetic diversity studies. we report polymorphic ssr loci for each species:  <dig> for p. atlantica,  <dig> for p. integerrima,  <dig> for p. terebinthus,  <dig> for p. chinensis, and  <dig> polymorphic for p. lentiscus. albaladejo et al.  <cit>  only developed eight polymorphic ssr loci for p. lentiscus. zaloglu et al.  <cit>  and topcu et al.  <cit>  developed ssrs from p. vera and tested them for pcr amplification in wild pistacia species. the authors did not analyze the ssr loci for polymorphism. therefore, this study describes an important number of novel polymorphic ssrs for each of five wild pistacia species.

the transferability rates of ssrs in this study were high; this is consistent with findings from previous studies performed by zaloglu et al.  <cit>  and topcu et al.  <cit> . taken together, these data demonstrate that ssrs are very powerful tools for use in synteny analysis in pistacia. the lowest transferability rate was obtained for p. lentiscus, which is one of the most distant species to p. vera in the genus  <cit> . the average number of alleles  in p. vera was higher in this study, while pic, observed , and expected  heterozygosities were similar to the values obtained in previous ssr development studies .

the first genetic linkage map in pistachio was constructed by türkeli and kafkas  <cit>  using an f <dig> interspecific population between p. vera  and monoecious p. atlantica . the same cultivar and the monoecious genotype were also plant materials of this study. all the  <dig> ssr loci in this study were polymorphic between siirt cultivar and monoecious pa- <dig> genotype. türkeli and kafkas  <cit>  constructed  <dig> and  <dig> linkage groups in siirt and pa- <dig>  respectively, that were higher than haploid chromosome number of pistachio, n =  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the polymorphic ssr loci developed in this study may facilitate to construct a reference ssr-based linkage map of pistachio.

cluster analysis and genetic structure in pistacia
all the genotypes and all six pistacia species separated and consistently grouped well in both cluster and structure analysis. the dendrogram and structure analysis at k =  <dig> divided pistacia species into two main clusters: the first cluster included all p. vera cultivars, while the second cluster contained the wild genotypes belonging to five pistacia species. the second cluster divided into two subclusters: the first subcluster contained p. atlantica and p. integerrima species, while the second subcluster contained p. chinensis, p. terebinthus, and p. lentiscus. p. atlantica was the closest species to p. vera, whereas p. lentiscus was the most distant species. similar results were obtained from other studies undertaking phylogenetic analyses in the genus pistacia  <cit> . kafkas and perl-treves  <cit>  divided the genus into two main groups: the first group included species with large, single-trunked trees, whereas the second group included species that mostly grow as shrubs or small trees. p. terebinthus and p. lentiscus were in the same group. these species were also clustered in the same group and were found to be the closest species in this study. a similar result was reported by kafkas  <cit>  using aflp markers.

the most comprehensive study on the relationships between p. vera cultivars was performed by kafkas et al.  <cit> . those authors grouped  <dig> p. vera cultivars into two main groups: the first contained the cultivars originated from iran and the second included the cultivars from mediterranean countries such as turkey, syria, and greece. we also observed similar groupings and genetic relationships among  <dig> pistachio cultivars in this study. structure analysis at k =  <dig> also supported the findings of the previous study performed by kafkas et al.  <cit> , and was confirmed by the upgma clustering analysis in this study. iranian cultivars such as ohadi and kallehghouchi were clustered in the iranian group while the other cultivars were clustered in the mediterranean group. the australian cultivar, sirora was in the iranian group, and this was supported by structure analysis at k =  <dig>  there were two kerman clones in the germplasm of the pistachio research institute, which were introduced from spain and usa. the clone introduced from spain was clustered in the iranian group and the other had a close relationship with the siirt cultivar from turkey. further study is necessary to elucidate the real kerman. the male cultivars atli, uygur, bagyolu, and kaska were in the separate group within p. vera in the upgma dendrogram. the structure analysis demonstrated that these cultivars have a wild origin as they share an important number of alleles with the wild pistacia species.

CONCLUSIONS
we had approximately 40× illumina data coverage for the genome survey in p. vera to gain knowledge on the structure of the pistachio genome. the assembled data were also used to search for ssrs in the pistachio genome, to develop novel ssr markers, and to study genetic diversity in six pistacia species. k-mer analysis indicated that the pistachio genome is highly heterozygous and is about 600 mb in size. the level of repeats in the pistachio genome was not high and the gc content was about  <dig> %. the ssr search in the assembled genome revealed  <dig>  ssrs with a frequency of  <dig>  kb. a total of  <dig> polymorphic ssr loci were developed from  <dig> ssr loci:  <dig> had amplifications and  <dig> were polymorphic in all six pistacia species. in conclusion, in this study, we present the first data on the structure of the pistachio genome, which may help to design whole genome sequencing studies in pistachio. furthermore, we also report novel polymorphic ssr markers for six pistacia species, which will enable further genetic mapping, genetic diversity, and germplasm characterization studies to be performed in the genus.
