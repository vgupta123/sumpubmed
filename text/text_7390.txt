BACKGROUND
in cytogenetic studies, abnormalities in chromosome structure are examined by microscopy. each human cell normally has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes, consisting of  <dig> pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes  <cit> . cytogenetic abnormalities are manifested as extra or fewer chromosomes than normal, e.g., having three copies of chromosome  <dig> in down's syndrome, one of the most common abnormalities. cytogenetic testing for abnormalities requires high-quality metaphase chromosome images, which are selected and sorted as shown in figure  <dig> 

in order to obtain enough analyzable metaphase spread images, at least  <dig> to  <dig> glass slide specimens have to be prepared for each individual. each glass slide typically contains about 10- <dig> metaphase spreads. from the total of approximately  <dig> prepared metaphases, approximately  <dig> of the "best"  metaphase spreads are selected for karyotyping  <cit> .

the consistency of chromosome numbers, i.e. total chromosome complement of each cell, is commonly determined by visual inspection among these top twenty metaphase spreads. once the chromosome complement is verified, generally two to five of the "sharpest" images are chosen for chromosome banding analysis for detecting chromosome band abnormalities. each step in this process is time consuming and requires experienced cytogeneticists to operate. thus, considerable effort has been made to develop automated chromosome image analysis tools to expedite this procedure.

each metaphase spread contains not only chromosome images but also some cell preparation artifacts  <cit> . these non-chromosome residues can be eliminated by visual inspection. however, in order to obtain an accurate karyotyping result, the metaphase spread must contain a large number of analyzable chromosomes, i.e., with clear banding patterns not obscured by overlapping chromosomes. previous research efforts have mainly focused on segmentation of overlapping chromosomes  <cit> . however, when overlapping chromosome images are segmented, the regions of chromosome overlap are ambiguous, which could potentially lead to an inaccurate diagnosis. therefore, getting clean metaphase spreads with well-separated individual chromosomes is preferable.

other earlier studies on chromosome analysis have concentrated on automatic karyotyping which attempts to order and classify the chromosomes into  <dig> pairs of autosomes and the two sex chromosomes. automatic karyotyping requires very informative features, such as band profiles, centromere positions, chromosome dimensions, etc. automatic karyotyping is based on the assumption that the input contains analyzable metaphases. numerous algorithms have been proposed to facilitate automatic karyotyping  <cit> . a recent technique proposed by moallem et al.  <cit>  used dark paths between chromosomes for classifying touching and overlapping chromosomes from good metaphase images. khan et al.  <cit>  presented a technique to geometrically correct deformed chromosomes so that the chromosomes can be karyotyped correctly. jahani et al  <cit>  focused on classification by identifying chromosome centromeres and their corresponding length.

to perform automatic karyotyping, hundreds of images must be manually examined in order to select spreads comprising mostly metaphase chromosomes for further analysis. the goal is thus to select the best metaphase spreads with clearly separated individual chromosomes for karyotyping. the selection of good, metaphase spreads is very time consuming, perhaps requiring hours of expert inspection of hundreds of specimens. thus, the cytogeneticist will normally select approximately  <dig> of the first good metaphase spreads that he/she has encountered, instead of examining all metaphase spreads from all specimen slides. hence, this arbitrary approach may exclude better metaphase spreads, and so lead to sub-optimal results. there is thus a need for a more thorough and efficient method of selecting good metaphase spreads for karyotyping. although some techniques have been proposed for automatic metaphase selection, in practice these techniques are impractical for processing hundreds of images in a typical cytogenetic analysis owing to the high computational complexity  <cit> ;  <cit> .

to our knowledge, there are only two works that have addressed the problem of improving the efficiency of automated metaphase selection. the first study  <cit>  concentrated on rapid identification of metaphase, but did not assess metaphase quality, i.e. the selection of analyzable versus non-analyzable metaphase. the second approach in  <cit>  utilizes skeletal analysis of chromosome images in order to estimate the number of analyzable chromosomes; hence, it can quickly select a few good metaphase spreads in terms of quality. however, the time to process each image can take up to  <dig> minutes, which is still not practical when dealing with a large number  of images.

to address the aforementioned problems, this work presents a rapid, practical chromosome classification tool for identification of good metaphase spreads based on rule-based classification. the software, called metasel, is the first attempt to offer a free assistive karyotyping tool for chromosome analysis. the software employs a heuristic that first defines important image parameters for chromosome feature extraction and then constructs rules for chromosome classification.

materials and methods
overview
specimens for cytogenetic testing were obtained by a standard clinical procedure at the rajanukul institute, ministry of public health, bangkok. in brief, cells from amniocentesis samples from pregnant women were applied to glass slides and stained with giemsa. chromosome images were obtained by microscopy using the zeiss axioskop <dig> model. a metaphase spread contains some individual chromosomes as well as other chromosomes that may not be well spread out, i.e., overlapping or touching. we defined objects from the metaphase spreads into four classes . the first three classes are in fact the underlying chromosomes whereas class- <dig> is considered as residues or artifacts, e.g., cell debris. individual chromosomes from class- <dig> and class- <dig> can be distinguished by their straightness. chromosomes from both classes must be individually separable. hence, class- <dig> is defined as straight individual chromosome, while class- <dig> is defined as skewed or bended individual chromosome. chromosomes from class- <dig> comprise other non-individual chromosomes that may be overlapping or touching with other chromosomes in the vicinity.

pre-processing
first an image is enhanced by using the histogram equalization threshold as described in  <cit>  for adjusting the gray level in the image. then, we attempted to separate the real chromosome image from its background. this process is called image segmentation in image processing  <cit> . in order to do the segmentation, we adopted the otsu's automatic threshold technique  <cit>  to isolate the chromosome image from the background.

chromosome classification
we performed image segmentation and rotated the resulting objects into their vertical orientation in order to classify segmented objects from metaphase spreads. the image parameters, namely width, height, and estimated area ratio, are extracted from the rotated images. the width and height parameters of each chromosome segment are the important factors used to quickly characterize the chromosomal objects into the four classifications. in particular, the area ratio can be defined as:

 arearatio=aoar 

where ar is the number of pixels inside the smallest enclosing rectangle  of the segmented object and ao is the number of pixels of the segmented object. figure  <dig> shows image parameters for chromosome image classification, where wrect and hrect are the width and the height of the minimum rectangle of segmented objects in pixel unit.

the area ratio quantifies the amount of the actual object pixels per the pixels inside the rectangle box demarcating the object. this ratio can be effectively used to classify the straightness of the chromosome. we verified this ratio by performing statistical analysis of randomly chosen chromosome area ratios from  <dig> straight and  <dig> touching/overlapping  chromosomes. the empirical probability density function was estimated using the kernel density method . gaussian model was used to determine the threshold value of the area ratio for classification. when the area ratio is greater than  <dig> %, the chromosome can be classified as class- <dig> . however, this class may contain some non-chromosome residues that need to be excluded.

since the width of class- <dig> chromosomes should be consistent, deviation from their average width is considered as residual objects. to detect these remainders, we first determine the total average width of all objects with the area ratio >  <dig> %. if the object width is greater than  <dig>  times of the total average width, such an object will be discarded. let ow represent the set of objects with the underlying width less than  <dig>  times of the total average width. the chromosome width of each object  in the set ow can be defined as:

 wi=total number of pixels in chromosomehrect 

then, the average width is defined as:

 wavg=∑i∈owwiow 

to quantify the deviation from the average width, we define the rectangle width ratio as:

 wrectratio=wrectwavg 

clearly, the deviation from the unity of wrectratio entails differences in terms of the quality of chromosome straightness. thus, the threshold value of the rectangle width ratio for class- <dig> is determined by the probability distribution of wrectratio. the experimental studies of this ratio were performed using  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples of small, large residual objects and straight individual chromosomes respectively. the empirical and gaussian probability density functions of wrectratio are depicted in figure  <dig>  when  <dig>  ≤ wrectratio ≤  <dig> , the corresponding object will be classified as straight individual chromosome . when wrectratio < <dig> , the chromosome object will be classified as a small non-chromosome residue . moreover, the object can be classified as class- <dig> when wrectratio >  <dig> , i.e., being a large object.

when wrectratio <  <dig> %, the corresponding object can be classified as either skewed individual chromosome or touching/overlapping chromosome. to distinguish between skewed objects and non-chromosome residues, the height of segmented object is defined as:

 hi=aowavg 

the ratio between hi and hrect, height ratio , is computed by.

 hiratio=hihrect 

we observed  <dig> skewed objects and overlapping chromosomes as well as  <dig> non-chromosome residues. the statistical analysis was performed to determine the threshold value of the height ratio for screening out unwanted residual objects. figure  <dig> presents the empirical probability density function of the height ratio which can be approximated by the gaussian model. using this model, chromosome objects will be classified as "residual" when hiratio <  <dig> . when hiratio ≥  <dig> , the objects will be classified as mixing between skewed objects and touching/overlapping chromosomes.

to separate skewed objects from those touching/overlapping chromosomes, one additional parameter must be used. it can be observed that the width of an overlapping chromosome will be larger than the width of a skewed individual. this parameter, called maximum width ratio , therefore, can be computed by using the maximum object width in pixels  and the average width :

 wmaxratio=wmaxwavg 

the threshold to separate skewed chromosome individuals from overlapping chromosomes was determined by using statistical analysis. the empirical probability density functions of skewed individuals and overlapping chromosomes were determined using  <dig> and  <dig> samples respectively. the gaussian model was used to approximate the empirical model for threshold calculation. the threshold for separating skewed individuals and overlapping chromosomes was chosen to be the intercept of the two gaussian curves  as shown in figure  <dig>  in other words, the objects will be classified as overlapping chromosomes when wmaxratio is greater than this selected threshold. when wmaxratio is less than or equal to the threshold, objects will be classified as skewed individuals. figure  <dig> summarizes image parameters  and the proposed rule-based algorithm  to classify chromosome images.

implementation of metasel
the proposed rule-based classification for metaphase selection was implemented in c# with opencv library. this classification module was incorporated into our karyotyping software tool, called metasel, which was written from scratch using c# on microsoft windows  <dig> operating system. based on the decision rules presented in figure  <dig>  the workflow of this tool can be described as follows:

 <dig>  open a project folder, which contains metaphase spread images .

 <dig>  performing metaphase analysis by using the proposed classification rule .

 <dig>  the metaphase images will be grouped into four classes and ranked according to their total number of individual chromosomes, which is calculated by combining the number of objects in class- <dig> and class- <dig> .

 <dig>  users choose which metaphase spread image to perform karyotyping. the higher rank generally refers to better quality  of the spread. in case of a tie, users are strongly advised to choose the image that contains more objects in class- <dig>  if the number of objects in class- <dig> is equal for the tie images, the number of object in class- <dig>  should be used to break the tie.

 <dig>  after choosing the metaphase spread image, metasel will line up the individual chromosomes from class- <dig>  and class- <dig> . users can select good metaphase images to later perform karyotyping.

 <dig>  users can go back to the original image to edit the ambiguous chromosome images  by cutting, merging, or fixing , the images so that they can be karyotyped as described in the previous step. 

RESULTS
two hundred metaphase spreads were used to determine the accuracy of the proposed rules. from these  <dig> metaphase images, 7817-segmented objects were obtained. the processing time for  <dig> metaphase images was  <dig>  seconds and, hence, the average processing time for each image was approximately  <dig>  seconds. the accuracy of this classification rule is shown in table  <dig>  we observe that only  <dig> % of class- <dig> was misclassified into class- <dig>  this classification error occurs due to residual objects that come with straight shape. skewed individuals  were misclassified as overlapping chromosomes  or residual objects . the accuracy of skewed individuals  classification was  <dig> %. some of class- <dig> objects were classified into class- <dig> and class- <dig>  this is because some overlapping chromosome arrangements were similar to the banding shape and some medium size residual objects. the accuracy of overlapping chromosomes  classification is  <dig> %. some overlapping chromosomes are misclassified into class- <dig>  class- <dig>  and class- <dig> since the random arrangements of overlapping pattern may resemble those classes. the rule gives very high accuracy  of non-chromosome objects  classification. there are only few percent of class- <dig> misclassification.

CONCLUSIONS
this work presents a method for chromosome classification using key chromosomal image parameters. we found that the area ratio, the rectangle width ratio, the chromosome width ratio, maximum width ratio and height ratio can be used to efficiently classify chromosome objects into four classes. from our experiments, the accuracy of individual with straight shape and skewed individual chromosomes were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. this study demonstrated that class- <dig> and class- <dig> of chromosomal images can be used to efficiently and accurately determine quality of the metaphase images. in other words, these classes of chromosome can be utilized to identify analyzable metaphase spreads. the processing time of chromosome classification is crucial for automated systems since the systems need to process large number of images in order to correctly diagnosis a patient. consequently, chromosome counting, e.g., down's syndrome screening can greatly benefit from our proposed chromosome classification. in the future, we planned to integrate existing automatic karyotyping algorithms and other chromosome analysis modules, e.g., numerical and structural abnormally detection. the current metaphase selection module was implemented and used in the metasel program. both software  and user manual can be freely downloaded from our website, http://www4a.biotec.or.th/gi/tools/metasel.
