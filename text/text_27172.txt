BACKGROUND
biological networks characterize the interactions of biomolecules at a systems-level and can help us better understand how biomolecules interact with each other to carry out biological functions in living cells. in the representation of biological networks, it is natural to use graph to describe the interactions between biomolecules. a node in a graph represents a biomolecule such as a gene, a protein or a metabolite, and an edge  indicates the interaction between these two biomolecules. such interactions could be physical interactions, metabolite flow, regulatory relationships, co-expression relationships, etc.  <cit> . one important property of networks is the modular structure, in which nodes are densely connected with each other, but between which there are only sparse connections  <cit> . biomolecules belonging to the same module interact with each other to carry out a specific biological function.

the rapid accumulation of genome-wide gene expression data allows the creation of gene co-expression networks by examining the co-expression patterns of genes over a large number of experimental conditions. in the gene co-expression network, a node is a gene, and an edge is drawn between gene a and b if the correlation coefficient between these two genes is above a threshold. gene co-expression networks have proven useful in analyzing microarray data in model organisms including yeast, mouse and human  <cit> . in plants, since the complete sequencing of the arabidopsis thaliana genome in  <dig>  thousands of microarray experiments under diverse conditions have been conducted, and the array data have been deposited in public databases. accordingly, genome-wide arabidopsis gene co-expression networks  have also been constructed by calculating the pairwise gene expression correlations over a large number of microarray experiments, ranging from over  <dig> arrays to more than  <dig> arrays  <cit> .

in detecting gene functional modules  from gene co-expression networks, a guide-gene approach is commonly used. in this approach, a set of genes with known functions, termed as guide genes , were used to query the gene co-expression network. a subnetwork comprising of the guide genes and the genes that were connected to the guide genes within a user-defined distance was retrieved. a gene module was then considered to be equivalent of the retrieved subnetwork itself  <cit> , or it was extracted from the subnetwork using visualization tools  <cit>  or maximal-clique-finding method  <cit> . using the guide-gene approach, one can find gene modules that are associated with a specific biological function or metabolic process  <cit> . however, the drawback of this approach is that a module found in this way might be incomplete and belong to a larger and more densely connected module  <cit> . in addition, using visualization to extract modules is subjective and affected by users' judgments. to avoid such drawbacks, an alternative approach, top-down approach , is used to naturally partition the network into modules by applying graph clustering algorithms. compared with the guide-gene approach that requires the prior knowledge about the seed genes, the top-down approach is relatively knowledge independent and novel hypotheses might be developed from the clustering result  <cit> .

in this report, we used a top-down approach to identify and evaluate gene functional modules from large arabidopsis microarray data sets. first, we constructed agcn by using more than  <dig> high quality microarrays. then, we analyzed the topological properties of the network and extracted modules from the network by using markov clustering  algorithm  <cit> . the functional coherence of the extracted modules was evaluated. in this report, we attempted to assess if there exists intrinsic modular structure in agcn and find the relationship between the network topology and formation of modular structure by comparing the real biological network with random networks. we then focused our analysis on two gene functional modules, photosynthesis module and cell cycle module, that are central to plant growth and development. a close examination of the organization of these two modules reveals that both modules involve multiple biological processes coordinated at the transcriptional level. although our findings are based on the analysis of arabidopsis microarray data, the uncovered network properties and organization of gene functional modules may have implications in non-plant organisms and other types of biological networks such as protein interaction networks.

RESULTS
we used  <dig> non-redundant affymetrix ath <dig> arrays from the atgenexpress consortium to calculate the pairwise correlations between genes. these arrays were normalized to the same scale by employing mas algorithm . the atgenexpress array data has been shown to be highly reliable and reproducible  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the experimental conditions of these  <dig> ath <dig> arrays. the high quality of the microarray data and diverse experimental conditions allow us to capture the true co-expression relationship between two genes.

to circumvent the correlation computed from noise, we used only the genes that showed significant changes across the  <dig> conditions . of the  <dig> arabidopsis probe sets on the ath <dig> chip,  <dig>  were selected. next, the genes' expression values were log transformed and pearson correlation coefficient  was computed between each pair of the  <dig> genes .

to choose an appropriate pcc cutoff value, we examined the changes in the node number, edge number, and network density as a function of pcc cutoff values. as the cutoff value increased, both the node number and edge number decreased ; however, as the cutoff reached a relatively high value, the decreasing rate of edges became slower than that of nodes, which might lead to an increase in the network density. indeed, as shown in figure 2b, the network density showed minima around  <dig>  pcc cutoff value and increased thereafter. a pcc cutoff value greater than  <dig>  would be appropriate so that edges with high pcc values would densely connect a decreasing number of nodes, which would facilitate the following detection of biologically meaningful modules  <cit> . in this study, pcc cutoff value was set to  <dig>  so that a relatively large number of nodes could be retained in the network. at this relatively stringent cutoff value, only the top  <dig> % of all possible edges among the  <dig> genes with respect to their pcc values were retained. the resulting agcn contains  <dig> nodes,  <dig>  edges, and a network density of  <dig> . for comparison, three random networks that each preserved the node numbers and node degrees of agcn were also created .

network topology
on average, each node in agcn has  <dig> co-expression links, but the distribution of the node degrees is highly skewed. the distribution fits to a power law distribution with a tail , indicating that the network is scale free. interestingly, we found that the top  <dig> nodes  in terms of their degrees connected to each other and formed a 382-member clique. each of these  <dig> genes has at least  <dig> co-expression links. we then examined the immediate neighbors of these  <dig> genes. surprisingly, these  <dig> genes were connected to only  <dig> other genes in agcn, whereas the same set of genes were linked to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> other genes in the three random networks, respectively. thus, unlike the random network, these hub genes did not reach out to the entire arabidopsis gene co-expression network. they were rather densely connected only to a fraction of the network. since a module is a subnetwork which is densely connected within itself but sparsely connected with rest of the network, these  <dig> genes and many of their densely connected neighbors will form a large module with the clique structure serving as the module's core. it was later confirmed by network clustering results .

we analyzed the functions of the  <dig> hub genes using gene ontology  . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were annotated with cellular component go terms. interestingly, among the  <dig> genes, the products of  <dig> genes  were located in chloroplast with a p-value as low as  <dig> e- <dig>  table  <dig> lists the biological process go terms that were significantly over-represented in the hub genes. the most dominant term was photosynthesis with respect to p-values. the  <dig> genes forming a co-expression clique exhibited a maximal degree of coordination at the transcriptional level, suggesting that these genes might be involved in a common biological function. based on the gene ontology analysis and the observation that several over-represented biological processes  are coupled with photosynthesis, the  <dig> genes are very likely to function in photosynthesis. additional evidence towards this conclusion is provided below.

 <dig>  'na' indicates the go term was not significantly over-represented.

to further evaluate the network topology, we analyzed the property of clustering coefficients. the clustering coefficient of a given node, cn, measures how close the node n and its directly connected neighbors resemble a clique . the agcn exhibited an average clustering coefficient, <cn>, of  <dig> , whereas the three random networks exhibited an average clustering coefficient of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. that <cn> of agcn is more than twice of the random network indicated the potential modularity in the co-expression network  <cit> . the distribution of the clustering coefficient  with respect to the node degree  further distinguished the co-expression network from the random networks . for each random networks, ck was approximately a constant with respect to k, and the variation of ck was small . for the agcn, ck exhibited a complex relationship with k, and the variation of ck was much larger . the complex relationship between ck and the node degree may affect how modules are organized in agcn  <cit> .

network clustering analysis
we used the mcl algorithm to partition agcn into gene modules. mcl is an efficient graph clustering algorithm based on the simulation of random walks within a graph. mcl has been applied to detect modules in yeast protein interaction networks  <cit>  and protein family networks  <cit> . a recent study, which evaluated four clustering algorithms for protein interaction networks, showed the superior performance of mcl in the identification of protein complexes  <cit> . the algorithm is very efficient and took only two minutes to perform clustering on the agcn  on a  <dig>  ghz intel xeon cpu with  <dig> gb memory.

the mcl algorithm has an important parameter, the inflation parameter . a higher value for i tends to produce a larger number of modules with a smaller module size. we tested different inflation values on the agcn as well as the three random networks. we used area fraction, mass fraction and efficiency  to assess the overall quality of the network clustering. since a module is a densely connected subnetwork and the connections between modules are sparse, clustering on a network with the intrinsic modular structure should produce a small area fraction but a large mass fraction close to one. this is indeed the case for the agcn . for example, when i was set to  <dig> , clustering on agcn captured  <dig> % of the entire edge masses by using only  <dig> % of the network area, reflecting the presence of modular structure in agcn. in contrast, with the same inflation value, all three random networks had to use 93% of the network area to capture a similar mass fraction , suggesting the absence of modular structure. an appropriate value for i is between  <dig>  and  <dig> . within this range, clustering on the co-expression network used  <dig> - 10% of the area to capture more than 85% of the entire edge masses. the above analysis is purely mathematical. recently brohee and van helden evaluated the mcl algorithm in identifying protein complexes from yeast protein interaction networks, and they chose  <dig>  as the optimal value for i based on the analysis of  <dig> artificial biological networks that simulated the data sets obtained from high-throughput experiments  <cit> . they also found that when i was set at  <dig> , mcl was resilient to network noise.

with the inflation value set to  <dig> , mcl detected  <dig> modules from the agcn. the ten largest modules were mapped to the network . similar to the node degree distribution, the module size distribution is also highly skewed. the largest module had  <dig> nodes whereas 86% of the modules had fewer than  <dig> nodes. the average size of the modules is  <dig>  and the median is  <dig>  the log-log plot of frequency versus module size demonstrates that the distribution of the module size followed a power law distribution with tails . with the same parameter setting, the largest module extracted from the three random networks contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nodes, respectively. and the size of the second largest module only ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nodes. the module size distribution further indicates the lack of modular structure in the random network.

module annotation
since genes belonging to the same module are co-expressed across diverse conditions, functional coherence among the module members is expected. we carried the enrichment analysis of biological process go terms in  <dig> modules containing  <dig> or more members.  <dig> of the  <dig> modules  had go terms that were significantly over-represented . we categorized these  <dig> modules by manual annotations . not surprisingly, the largest group is associated with 'response to stimulus' , the major theme of microarray experiments in atgenexpress .

furthermore, we observed that  <dig> of the  <dig> modules  in agcn had over-represented go terms with fwer-adjusted p-values below 5e-4; whereas all three random networks had less than 1% of the modules with over-represented go terms at such significance level . the annotations for these  <dig> modules include both central metabolic processes and specific cellular functions . in addition, we compared the clustering result for agcn using  <dig>  inflation value with that using  <dig> . although mcl clustering showed maximal efficiency at  <dig>  , the clustering result at  <dig>  inflation value produced a higher percentage of functionally coherent modules .

 <dig>  the number of genes which were assigned with biological process go terms in a module.

 <dig>  only the most over-represented go term was listed for each module.

 <dig>  the p value indicated the probability that a module contains equal or larger number of genes associated with the go term under a hypergeometric distribution.

in addition to analyzing the enrichment of go terms in modules, we also analyzed the over-representation of pathway terms . however, only 10% of the  <dig> genes in agcn have been annotated as metabolic pathway genes. among the  <dig> modules, each of which contained at least three annotated pathway genes,  <dig> were detected with significantly enriched pathway terms. ten of them  were listed in table  <dig>  the table also indicates the correspondence between the enriched pathway terms and biological process go terms.

 <dig>  the two values listed in this column refer to the number of genes annotated to the over-represented pathway in the module and the number of genes annotated to the same pathway in the network.

the effectiveness of our approach is best illustrated by the correspondence of these computational modules with actual biological entities. three of these modules are examined in detail from this perspective and are presented below.

module  <dig> - photosynthesis
module  <dig>  the largest module in agcn, had  <dig> nodes,  <dig> edges and a density of  <dig> . as shown previously, the  <dig> hub genes in agcn formed a clique and altogether connected to  <dig> neighbors. all of the  <dig> hub genes and  <dig> of their neighbors were included in module  <dig> and constituted 95% of the module members.

the significantly over-represented biological process go terms detected in module  <dig> are depicted in figure 8a. they were consolidated into seven major go terms based on their hierarchical relations . five of the seven major go terms are also significantly over-represented in the  <dig> hub genes . the p-values for protein biosynthesis and electron transport go terms are similar between module  <dig> and the hub genes, respectively. however, the p-values for the other three go terms  in module  <dig> are much more significant than those in the hub genes , indicating that module  <dig> was formed by recruiting more functionally related genes to the 382-member clique.

among the seven major go terms, photosynthesis is the most over-represented biological process in module  <dig> , and three other processes  bear direct physiological connections/associations with photosynthesis. we show below that the remaining three major processes  are also strongly integrated with photosynthesis, respectively. thus, photosynthesis becomes the uncontested umbrella process for module  <dig> 

the  <dig> cofactor metabolism genes in module  <dig> included  <dig> genes involved in atp biosynthesis,  <dig> genes in nadph regeneration, and  <dig> genes in the biosynthesis of photosynthetic electron carriers such as fe-s cluster, quinones and hemes.

among the  <dig> protein biosynthesis genes, the potential locations of the products of  <dig> genes could be assigned to chloroplast based on their cellular component go terms, genes' annotations  <cit> , and literatures . these  <dig> genes included  <dig> genes which might function as the structural constituents of the chloroplast ribosome,  <dig> genes involved in translation initiation/elongation/release, and  <dig> genes involved in trna aminoacylation. these protein biosynthesis genes are probably involved in the synthesis of photosystem proteins inside chloroplast. for example, rps <dig> and rpl <dig> encode two chloroplast ribosomal proteins, and the transcripts of these two genes were much more abundant in leaves and stems than they were in roots  <cit> . in a mutation of arabidopsis where the rps <dig> expression was dramatically reduced, the activity of the photosystem i  was significantly reduced  <cit> . the hcf <dig> gene encodes a protein localized to the chloroplast membrane  <cit> . the experimental results demonstrated the critical role of hcf <dig> in the 5'-end processing/stability and/or translation of the psbh  gene as well as in the translation of the psbb gene  <cit> . hcf <dig> encodes a peptide chain release factor  <dig>  which is involved in the process of translational termination in chloroplasts  <cit> . in the hcf <dig> mutant, the protein abundances for two atp synthase subunits, the photosystem i psac, the photosystem ii psbb, and psbz were substantially reduced  <cit> .

the seven vitamin metabolism genes are involved in vitamin b <dig> , b <dig> , b <dig> , c , and e  biosynthesis. among the seven genes, at5g <dig> and vtc <dig> encode enzymes involved in the ascorbic acid  biosynthesis pathway. it was shown that the light regulation of asa biosynthesis in arabidopsis leaves is dependent on the photosynthetic electron transport chain  <cit> . on the other hand, asa is a potent antioxidant which could detoxify the reactive oxygen generated by photosynthesis and adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . ascorbate-deficient mutant of arabidopsis exhibited the symptoms of chronic photooxidative stress when grown in high light  <cit> . other vitamins such as vitamin b <dig> and e could also function as potent antioxidants and protect plants from the photooxidative stress  <cit> .

with respect to over-represented pathway terms in module  <dig>  both light reaction and dark reaction of photosynthesis were significantly over-represented . the pathways to synthesize two photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoid, were also over-represented. when we looked at cellular component go terms, the products of 59% of  <dig> annotated genes in module  <dig> could be assigned to the chloroplast .

following the functional analysis of genes in module  <dig>  we examined their transcriptional activities under different conditions. here, we focused our examination on the  <dig> hub genes which formed a clique and served as the core of the module. the gene expression behavior of the hub genes should be a typical representation of module  <dig>  overall, the hub genes exhibited a tightly controlled co-expression pattern across the  <dig> conditions profiled in atgenexpress . particularly, these hub genes showed an oscillatory expression pattern over the  <dig> conditions which consisted of nine environmental stresses  <cit>  . the average expression level for each hub gene over the  <dig> conditions sampled from the shoot tissue is higher than that over the remaining  <dig> conditions sampled from the root tissue. the average fold increase over all  <dig> hub genes is  <dig>  in another experimental setting, gene expressions in response to light stimulus were compared with those under darkness conditions . we found that 97% of the  <dig> hub genes showed higher expression levels with the treatment of 4-hour continuous white light compared with the treatment of 4-hour continuous darkness ; whereas only 54% of the  <dig> genes in agcn showed higher expression levels upon the light treatment. thus, the  <dig> hub genes are highly expressed in shoots and up-regulated by light.

based on the enrichment analysis of biological process and cellular component go terms, pathway information and gene expression data, module  <dig> is likely to carry on the biological function of photosynthesis by coordinating more than  <dig> genes' transcriptional activities. based on this module-level annotation, many genes in module  <dig> with unknown functions would be hypothesized to be linked to photosynthesis  <cit> .

module  <dig> - cell cycle
module  <dig> has  <dig> nodes,  <dig> edges with a density of  <dig> . through consolidation, three major biological process go terms were retrieved from the hierarchical relations of the go terms that were over-represented in module  <dig> : dna metabolism , cell cycle , and cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis . altogether, these  <dig> genes account for 63% of the genes in the module with known biological processes.

among the  <dig> cell cycle genes,  <dig> encode the cell cycle regulators that included  <dig> cyclins,  <dig> cyclin-dependent protein kinases ,  <dig> members of the e2f transcription factors , wee <dig>  mad <dig>  tso <dig> and pcna <dig>  e2f transcription factors play important roles in pathways related to cell division, dna repair, and differentiation <cit> . wee <dig>  a protein kinase, controls cell cycle arrest by functioning as a dna replication checkpoint  <cit> . mad <dig> is a mitotic spindle checkpoint protein. tso <dig> is a small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  which is critical for cell cycle progression, dna damage repair, and plant development  <cit> . tso <dig> mutants resulted in developmental defects, including callus-like floral organs and fasciated shoot apical meristems  <cit> . pcna <dig> is a proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is involved in dna replication, dna repair, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle regulation, and other functions  <cit> . interestingly, pcna <dig> is transcriptionally regulated by e2f  <cit> .

the  <dig> dna metabolism genes in module  <dig> included  <dig> genes involved in dna replication, and  <dig> genes involved in chromatin assembly  and modification . the dna metabolism process is apparently integrated with the cell cycle. since cells orchestrated the coordinated progression through the cell cycle, the genes involved in dna metabolism in module  <dig> are likely subject to the cell-cycle regulation. this is indeed the case. for example, orc1a, orc1b, orc <dig> and orc <dig> encode the subunits of origin recognition complex which is involved in the initiation of dna replication. the expressions of these four orc genes are all regulated by e2f  <cit> . another target of the e2f transcriptional factor, fas <dig>  encodes the chromatin assembly factor- <dig>  large subunit. loss of fas <dig> caused the inhibition of mitotic progression and triggered the endocycle program  <cit> . the regulation of h <dig> genes by another cell cycle regulator, tso <dig>  was demonstrated by the result that in a tso <dig> mutant, h4-expressing cells in flowers were dramatically increased compared with wild type, suggesting a prolonged s-phase in the mutant  <cit> .

among the  <dig> cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis genes,  <dig> encode kinesin motor proteins,  <dig> encodes γ-tubulin, and  <dig> encode actin-binding proteins. the kinesin motor proteins move along microtubules and play a role in mitosis by functioning in spindle formation, chromosome movement and cytokinesis  <cit> . since multiple kinesin genes were detected in the co-expression module, their products might act cooperatively and play a role in the formation of mitotic microtubule arrays such as phragmoplast <cit> . it was shown that several members of the kinesin protein family were probably regulated by cdk phosphorylation  <cit> . γ-tubulin, is required for centrosomal and noncentrosomal microtubule nucleation and coordinates late mitotic events in arabidopsis  <cit> . the functional role of actin cytoskeleton in the progression of cell cycle was well described in  <cit> .

since dna metabolism, microtubule and actin organization and biogenesis carried by the genes in module  <dig> are all integrated with the cell cycle, the module is likely to carry on the function of cell cycle and cell proliferation. since the cell cycle regulation is one of the keys to the control of plant development  <cit> , we selected a data set from atgenexpress which made up a gene expression map of arabidopsis development  <cit> . the data set has  <dig> arrays which profiled many development stages, various tissues/organs, wild type and different mutants.

in contrast to the shoot apex and flowers, nearly all of the genes in module  <dig> showed relatively low expression in leaves across all development stages .

module  <dig> - starch metabolism
compared with module  <dig> and  <dig>  module  <dig> is a relatively small module with  <dig> nodes,  <dig> edges and a density of  <dig> . eight of ten genes in module  <dig> are involved in starch metabolism  based on their go annotations. the other two genes are at3g <dig> and at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> encodes a cytosolic alpha-glucan phosphorylase which was suggested to function as an enzyme of starch degradation  <cit> . at2g <dig> encodes an outer plastid envelope protein which was involved in the import of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase a  <cit> . the expression of at2g <dig> gene was shown to be modulated by sucrose and responsive to a starchless mutant  <cit> . how this sugar sensing gene communicates with other starch metabolism genes remains to be elucidated.

comparison with ggm network
in this study, we used standard pcc to measure the degree of co-expression between two genes and connected them in the network if their pcc is above a certain cutoff value. one concern with this approach is due to the transitive property of the standard correlation coefficient, which implies that if gene a and gene b are correlated with gene c, respectively, then a and b should be expected to correlate as well  <cit> . if this were true, then every gene with at least two neighbors in the agcn would have a clustering coefficient close to  <dig>  the plot displaying the relationship between the clustering coefficient  and node degree  would approximately be a straight line of ck =  <dig>  however, as shown in figure 4b, ck showed a complex relationship with the node degree. some sets of genes had relatively high clustering coefficients, suggesting the tight co-expression; while others had low clustering coefficients, indicating loose co-expression. as an example, among the  <dig> disconnected components each of which had exactly three nodes,  <dig> components had two edges connecting three genes whereas only  <dig> components had three edges, indicating only limited co-expression transitivity in agcn. nevertheless, we compared agcn constructed in this study with the arabidopsis gene network derived from a modified graphical gaussian model , which used partial correlation as well as the standard pearson correlation to select significantly correlated gene pairs  <cit> .

in their study, a network of  <dig>  edges connecting  <dig> genes was obtained by using ggm  <cit> . the number of genes contained in the ggm-based network is close to that in agcn constructed in this study. on the other hand, the average connectivity of a node in the ggm based network was  <dig> , which is much smaller than that  in agcn. such a sparsely connected network, together with the number of highly connected genes being less than what would be expected according to the power-law distribution , would be a challenge for computational methods to reliably detect a large number of modules  <cit> . using the guide-gene approach, the authors retrieved subnetworks from the ggm based network. each subnetwork included a seed gene and the genes that were within certain connecting steps from the seed gene. a functional module was then considered to be equivalent of the retrieved subnetwork itself. the disadvantage of this approach is that the retrieved subnetwork might be embedded within a larger module or it may include extra noisy genes. nevertheless, the go terms for many biochemical pathways , cell wall metabolism, and cold response were significantly enriched in the subnetworks retrieved from the ggm-based gene network  <cit> . these go terms were also significantly over-represented in the modules extracted from the agcn . however, with the guide-gene approach, the distinct major modules corresponding to photosynthesis , ribosome assembly and protein biosynthesis , and dna metabolism and cell cycle , which are central to the plant growth and development, seemed to be absent from their report  <cit>  probably because the correlations between many genes involved in these functions were determined to be insignificant by their partial correlation standard.

since the gene modules of agcn were detected by using the top-down approach, for a direct comparison, we also applied the same approach to the ggm network. again, mcl algorithm was used to naturally partition the ggm network into modules. the functional coherence of obtained gene modules was assessed by using biological process go terms . in general, clustering on the ggm network produced a larger number of modules but smaller module size compared with the clustering result of agcn. for example, at  <dig>  inflation value, mcl detected  <dig> modules from the ggm network with the largest module only containing  <dig> nodes. with the same inflation value, mcl detected  <dig> modules from the agcn with the largest modules containing  <dig> nodes. nine additional modules in agcn also have more than  <dig> nodes. although a large number of relatively small modules were detected in ggm network, interestingly, the distribution of module size fits very well to a power law distribution . a power law distribution was also observed for module size of agcn .

since a module is a densely connected subnetwork and the connections between modules are sparse, clustering on a network with internal modular structure should produce a large mass fraction close to one. however, it is not the case for ggm network . for example, at  <dig>  inflation value, clustering on ggm network captured 64% of the entire edge masses whereas agcn captured 96% of edge masses. we also compared biological process go term enrichment results between ggm and agcn. clustering on agcn produced a slightly higher percentage of functionally coherent modules . in the ggm network, the module with the most over-represented photosynthesis go term  has  <dig> genes, the cell-cycle module  has  <dig> genes, and protein biosynthesis module  has  <dig> genes. in comparison, the corresponding gene functional modules in agcn had much larger module sizes, and they were detected with the over-represented go terms that were much more statistically significant .

to use ggm approach to construct genome-wide arabidopsis gene network, a large number of samples are required. since there are more than  <dig> thousand genes in arabidopsis, a sample size comparable to the gene number is required to assess a full partial correlation for every gene pair  <cit> . in contrast, the standard pcc approach does not require a large sample size. it can be used to analyze small data sets that are typically seen in focused microarray experiments. as a proof of concept, we applied our network-based approach to a relatively small data set. the data set profiles global gene expression in shoot in response to continuous cold stress . the gene expression was measured at  <dig> time points   <cit> . for each time point two samples serving as replicates were analyzed. thus, the data set consists of a total of  <dig> samples. of the  <dig> arabidopsis probe sets on the ath <dig> chip,  <dig>  were selected as the genes that showed significant changes over the  <dig> samples . pcc value for each pair of the  <dig> genes was calculated and sorted. the top  <dig> % of gene pairs with respect to their pcc values were used to construct the cold induced gene co-expression network. the same percentage of gene pairs were retained in the 1094-array agcn. the resulting cold induced gene network has  <dig> nodes,  <dig> edges, and a network density of  <dig> .

following the construction of cold induced gene network, mcl algorithm was used to partition the network into modules.  <dig> modules with at least three genes were obtained at  <dig>  inflation value. of these modules,  <dig>  had biological process go terms that were significantly over-represented . among the enriched go terms, 'response to auxin stimulus' is the most over-represented . it has been reported that auxin responsive genes were regulated by cold stress which may contribute to the alteration of plant growth to coordinate with cold  <cit> . 'cellular carbohydrate metabolism' is the second most over-represented biological process go term, and it was identified in module  <dig> . the module includes genes involved in starch, sucrose, trehalose and glucose metabolism. starch and sugars play an important role in the biochemical adaption of plant to cold  <cit> . other go terms for biological processes involved in transcription regulation, cellular defense, stress response, and signal transduction are also significantly over-represented. taken together, these results can help us better understand the molecular mechanisms of plant cold responses. it demonstrates that our network-based approach can be applied to analyze small data sets and identify gene modules important to specific biological questions.

discussion
in this study, we used a top-down approach  to naturally partition the genome-wide arabidopsis gene co-expression network into gene modules based on the topological property of the network. we used an efficient graph clustering algorithm to identify modules from the agcn. compared with the traditional clustering analysis such as hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering, the network approach provides additional structural information regarding the connectivity of genes  <cit> . genes belonging to the same module are not only highly correlated at the expression level but also densely connected to each other. thus, compared with a cluster obtained from traditional clustering methods, a module detected from the network is a more tightly controlled structure which would be more biologically meaningful and resilient to data noise  <cit> .

the constructed agcn and its extracted modules showed the following properties:  the distribution of the node degree fits to a power law distribution . such distribution was also observed in the human gene co-expression network and conserved gene co-expression network derived from the human, fly, worm and yeast comparisons  <cit> .  the hub genes in the agcn were densely connected to each other as shown by the clique structure formed by the  <dig> hub genes. although it contradicts with a commonly held view that hub nodes tend not to link to each other, it has been recently reported that hub-hub interactions were not suppressed in a multi-validated high-confidence protein interaction network for yeast  <cit> . in addition it was shown that nodes in gene co-expression networks tended to connect with the ones with similar degrees while the connections between highly and lowly connected nodes were suppressed  <cit> .  here, we further argue that the preferential hub-hub connections would be necessary for the formation of modular structure in gene co-expression networks. the hub genes which are densely connected to each other would be self-contained in a single module. in our case, the  <dig> hub genes were embedded in module  <dig>  in contrast, for the random networks, which had the same distribution of node degrees as agcn but in which the connection between a hub and a low degree gene would not be expected to be suppressed, our results clearly indicate the lack of modular structure.  the average clustering coefficient of agcn was increased by more than one fold compared with the random networks, supporting the modular structure in agcn.  similar to the node degree distribution, the distribution of the module size also follows a power law distribution . interestingly, the distribution of the sizes of  <dig> complexes extracted from the yeast protein interaction network also displayed the power law distribution  <cit> . the biological implication of the power law distribution of the module size remains to be further investigated.

the approach used in this study, constructing a gene co-expression network and naturally partitioning the network into modules, provided a systems-level understanding of the gene modules that coordinate multiple biological processes to carry out specific biological functions. plants convert light energy to chemical energy through photosynthesis. our results suggested that photosynthesis module in arabidopsis involves a very large number  of genes which participate in photosynthesis and related biological processes. the related biological processes encompassed protein biosynthesis, electron transport, cofactor metabolism, chloroplast organization and biogenesis, pigment metabolism, and vitamin metabolism. the go terms for these biological processes were all significantly over-represented, suggesting the important roles of these biological processes in photosynthesis. nevertheless, other biological processes which were not significantly over-represented might also play a role in photosynthesis. different from most animals, plants develop continuously with new organs being developed throughout the lifetime of the plant  <cit> . the cell cycle regulation is one of the keys to the control of plant development. the cell cycle module detected from agcn orchestrated the coordinated expression of hundreds of genes participating in cell cycle, dna metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis. interestingly, a human cell cycle module, which was obtained from an integrated analysis of ~ <dig> cancer arrays, gene ontology and pathways, contained approximately the same number of genes  and similar gene function compositions  <cit> . in this report, we studied the gene co-expression network and functional modules for arabidopsis. the same approach should be applicable to other model organisms.

genes in the same module are co-expressed across diverse conditions, suggesting the potential underlying co-regulation mechanism. the list of gene modules obtained in this study would provide a useful tool for the regulation investigation. one approach to linking co-expression to co-regulation is to examine the putative transcription factor binding sites  in the promoters of the co-expressed genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used a network-based approach to identify gene functional modules from large microarray data sets of arabidopsis thaliana. the study reveals new insight into the topological properties of biological networks. the preferential hub-hub connections might be necessary for the formation of modular structure in gene co-expression networks. the study also reveals new insight into the organization of gene functional modules.
