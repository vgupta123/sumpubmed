BACKGROUND
from the colorful tail feathers of peacocks to the enormous antlers of deer, exaggerated sexual structures are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom . among the most extreme examples of sexually-selected traits are the weapons of beetles. many species of scarab beetles have horns jutting out from the head and thorax and many stag beetles have elongated mandibles . all are used as weapons for male-male combat over access to reproduction. the shapes and sizes of beetle weapons differ widely among families, genera, and sometimes even between populations of the same species, and most of these weapons are sexually dimorphic  <cit> .

although much research has focused on the function and evolution of beetle weapons , the proximate mechanisms regulating their development are also beginning to be explored. recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies and the successful utilization of rna interference  have enabled researchers to delve into the genetic mechanisms underlying the growth, expression, and condition-dependence of these traits. several recent studies focusing on horns in scarab beetles have revealed many of the genetic mechanisms regulating horn development, growth, and condition-dependence . because of their sex-specific expression, the sex determination genes of insects, which are highly conserved across the arthropods and animals in general  <cit> , are particularly important to understanding the development of sexually selected weapon traits  <cit> .

despite the overall conservation in sexual differentiation genes in arthropods, the initial cues of the sex determination cascade are highly diverse both at the chromosomal level  and at the level of the molecular signal  gene in drosophila  <cit> , transformer  in ceratitis  <cit> , and sex-specific expression of pirna fem in bombyx  <cit> ). diversity among species is also found in the maternal transfer of tra mrna in nasonia  <cit>  and heterozygosity in the complementary sex determiner  gene’s activation of the gene feminizer  in honeybees  <cit> . although the relative importance of these upstream signals appears to vary from species to species, as does the default activation state of the tra and fem genes , all sex determination mechanisms known for insects thus far integrate expression of this same network of genes  <cit> , and they all result in the sex-specific expression of alternative splice variants of the sex determination gene doublesex , which, in turn, appears to trigger sex-specific patterns of growth of dimorphic body parts .

recently several authors, including our group, have shown that dsx regulates sex-specific trait expression in beetles, including species with horns and elongated mandibles . however, very little is known about the initial cues of sex determination in these species, or about pathway members acting upstream of dsx in the sex determination cascade.

in this study, we tested the role of several genes in the sex determination pathway known to regulate sex-specific trait expression in other animals in the sexually dimorphic and male dimorphic golden metallic stag beetle cyclommatus metallifer . this species  possess extremely elongated mandibles, which are expressed in a sex and condition dependent manner  <cit> . we constructed a transcriptome for the critical prepupal period of development when all adult structures are determined and differentiating in c. metallifer in order to rigorously test the hypothesis that the effector genes for sexual differentiation are conserved with other insects. we queried this transcriptome database for  <dig> sex-determination cascade genes known in drosophila, and identified  <dig> putative homologs in c. metallifer. from these  <dig> sex-determination cascade gene homologs, we selected three central sex-determination cascade genes for further analyses; tra, tra <dig>  and ix, which have significant roles during sexual differentiation in many insects. also, we analyzed sxl, which is recruited as a key upstream switch for sex determination in the drosophila lineage.fig.  <dig> the golden metallic stag beetle, cyclommatus metallifer. female  and large male  are shown. only males possess enlarged mandibles, which are used for male-male competition over resources. scale bar indicates 20 mm



the gene sxl is activated in drosophila females based on the dose of x chromosome  <cit> . once activated, female splice forms of sxl appear to control their own expression by a positive feedback splicing mechanism, resulting in the regulation and splicing of downstream genes such as tra and dsx in a sex-specific manner  <cit> . the sxl gene is not activated in drosophila males, and, in the absence of this signal, male-specific tra and dsx splice variants are expressed. the role of sxl in sexual differentiation appears to be specific to the drosophila lineage, though the functions of sxl outside of drosophila are not well known  <cit> .

the ix gene is also necessary for female development in drosophila and has been shown to act in concert with dsx in the sex determination pathway  <cit> . tra and tra <dig> are required for female sexual development in many insect groups including drosophila, apis and tribolium, and function by regulating the alternative splicing of dsx  <cit> . tra is expressed as different splice variants in a sex-specific manner  <cit>  and, as with sxl in drosophila, female specific splice forms of tra in some insects contain an autoregulatory domain that appears to result in self-activation of expression, with the resulting positive feedback contributing to sex differences in expression and splice forms of downstream genes in the pathway  <cit> . what roles these genes may have in regulating sexual dimorphisms in animals with sexually-selected weapons has yet to be explored.

we examined the expression pattern of c. metallifer tra, ix, sxl and tra <dig>  using rt-pcr. also, we analyzed the function of cmix, cmsxl and cmtra <dig> by rna interference . functional analyses revealed that of these, cmix is necessary for female differentiation, while cmsxl is not necessary for sexual trait differentiation in either males or females. knockdown of cmtra <dig> resulted in death at the prepupal stage in both sexes, suggesting that cmtra <dig> likely has an additional function during development besides its known role in sex determination. in this study we also report the functional characterization of male and female specific isoforms of the sex determination gene c. metallifer doublesex , which was initially identified in a previous study by our group. functional analyses via rnai for isoform-specific cmdsx genes revealed that two have critical roles in sex-specific weapon trait differentiation in c. metallifer.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
we performed roche 454-pyrosequencing of an mrna-enriched rna library prepared from head and prothorax tissue of c. metallifer larvae and prepupae - three each of small and large individuals of both sexes. this stage was chosen as the most likely developmental period when differentiation of adult structures is occurring  <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads consisting of  <dig> ,087 bp were sequenced. raw sequence data was submitted to ncbi’s sequence read archive  under the bioproject accession number prjna <dig>  assembled and annotated transcriptome files available upon request. after adapter trimming and quality filtering, the reads were assembled into a de novo transcriptome using newbler  <dig> . this transcriptome produced  <dig>  contigs, incorporating  <dig> , <dig> base pairs and  <dig> , <dig> reads.  <dig>  contigs were larger than 500 bp . the average “large” contig size was  <dig>  bp, with a max contig size of  <dig>  bp . the average read depth was  <dig> , and the n <dig> was  <dig> . the assembled contigs were used to generate putative isoform variants, or isotigs.  <dig>  isotigs were generated, with an average size of  <dig>  bp . the average number of contigs per isotig was  <dig> , with  <dig>  isotigs deriving from single contigs . the isotigs were grouped into  <dig>  unique isogroups . a total of  <dig>  isogroups only contained a single isotig, with an average of  <dig>  isotigs per isogroup .fig.  <dig> summary of cyclommatus metallifer transcriptome assembly. a length distribution of contig sequences. x-axis indicates sequence length of contig and y-axis indicates number of contigs. b length distribution of isotig sequences. x-axis indicates sequence length of isotig and y-axis indicates number of isotigs  number of contigs used in the assembly of individual isotigs. x-axis indicates number of contigs per each isotig and y-axis indicates number of isotigs  number of isotigs used in the assembly of individual isogroups. x-axis indicates number of isotigs per each isogroup and y-axis indicates number of isogroups



after assembly, we performed blastx searches of the isotigs against the ncbi non-redundant protein database  <cit> , using an e-value cut-off of e− <dig>  after the blastx search, isotigs from each isogroup were filtered by best blast hit. if no members of an isogroup had a blast hit, one isotig from that isogroup was randomly selected to represent that isogroup. this left a total of  <dig>  isotigs.  <dig>  isotigs  had significant homology with proteins in the database. many of them  have e-values < e− <dig> . most of the isotigs  had the highest similarity with sequences of red flour beetle tribolium castaneum . considering their phylogenetic closeness  and the completeness of tribolium genome sequence and its annotation, this result is expected. gene ontology  terms were assigned to each isotig using blast2go .fig.  <dig> results of blastx search and classification of sequences based on go term analyses. a distribution of blastx top-hits against ncbi non-redundant protein database. e-value cutoff of e- <dig> was used as threshold. results with an e-value < e- <dig> were clustered together. b distribution of blastx results, clustered by species of origin. blastx hits that returned an “unknown” species were removed from the analysis. c-e gene ontology isotig groups for biological process , molecular function , and cellular component

notably, the isogroup corresponding to cmtra <dig> contained nine different isotigs, indicating that cmtra <dig> potentially has multiple different splice variants . since three splice variants corresponding to isotig  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were predicted to lack 5’ sequences, we additionally performed 5’ race to identify 5’ sequences of these splice variants. three of these variants also shared exons  <dig> and  <dig> with isotigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  at the protein level, five different putative protein products  were encoded . isoform a, b and c are similar to each other, that is, they share conserved regions. differences among the isoforms are only detected in the last several amino acid residues at the 3’ends . isoform d and e are shorter than the other three, due to the insertion of stop codons on exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  in addition to cmtra <dig>  two isotigs corresponded to the female lethal d d) homolog,suggesting the existence of splice variants .fig.  <dig> predicted gene models of the c. metallifer transformer- <dig>  gene. nine different splice variants were predicted from the database assembly and annotation. a total of five different isoforms were predicted . the coding sequences are in gray, stop codons are indicated by black arrowheads. the open arrowhead indicates the start codon. arrows indicate forward and reverse primer locations for rt-pcr and the red bar indicates the region for dsrna synthesis. the blue dashed box indicates the sequences which were identified by 5’ race



additionally, we found tra-like sequence in our database  by using the tribolium tra homolog as a query, although the homology was relatively low . expression analyses and subsequent sequencing revealed that gene transcripts and the corresponding putative protein products were different between sexes . the male-specific isoform was shorter than the female-specific isoform due to an insertion of a stop codon in exon  <dig> . the female-specific isoform possessed a putative auto-regulation domain, which is contained in all tra genes identified in other insects except drosophila  <cit> . this auto-regulation domain was only partially conserved in the male-specific isoform . phylogenetic analyses identifying female tra proteins in other insects indicated that this tra-like putative protein was grouped with tribolium tra . thus, we concluded that the tra-like isotig  <dig> is the cyclommatus tra homolog and named it cmtra.fig.  <dig> gene annotation of isotig  <dig>  a predicted gene model of isotig  <dig> , and expressed transcripts in females and males. the coding sequences are in gray, stop codons are indicated by black arrowheads. the open arrowhead indicates the start codon. arrows indicate forward and reverse primer locations for rt-pcr  expression patterns of cmtra in females and males. template cdnas were derived from stage  <dig> prepupae. h: head, l: leg, w: wing. gapdh was used as a positive control.  alignment of conserved  <dig> amino acid sequences of the putative auto regulation domain  <cit>  of the tra protein. d nj tree of tra protein from the conserved  <dig> amino acid auto-regulation domain



expression analyses of cmsxl, cmix, and cmtra2
from the  <dig> candidate c. metallifer sex determination genes , we selected cmsxl, cmix, and cmtra <dig> for expression and functional analyses because these three genes have well known functions in the sex determination cascade in drosophila. in order to describe the expression patterns of those candidate genes, we conducted semi-quantitative rt-pcr between the sexes and across body parts  during the prepupal period. our results showed uniform expression of cmsxl between sexes and among body parts . the expression pattern of cmix was also neither sex nor body-parts specific . since there were several assembled isotigs homologous to cmtra <dig> indicating existence of multiple splice variants, we used multiple primers to investigate the expression of specific cmtra <dig> splice variants. only a single product was detected by rt-pcr using the f1-r <dig> primer set . according to its size, this amplified product is probably composed of exon  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  thus, isotig  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  appear to be the most commonly expressed forms. products of the isotigs corresponding to isoform d and e were not amplified to a detectable level. in addition, rt-pcr using f2-r <dig> primers also amplified only a single product with 370 bp predicted size , suggesting that isotig  <dig>  had higher expression than isotig  <dig> , and that the major expressed variants are isotig  <dig> and/or  <dig>  we could not find any evidence of sex specific or organ specific expression of cmtra <dig>  regardless of the primer sets used for rt-pcr.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of cmsxl, cmix and cmtra <dig>  template cdnas were derived from stage  <dig> prepupae. h: head, l: leg, w: wing. a expression patterns of cmix and cmsxl. only a single product was amplified regardless of sex or tissue type. b expression patterns of cmtra <dig> using different pairs of primers. see fig.  <dig> for their position. only a single product was amplified regardless of sex or tissue type. gapdh was used as positive control for both analyses



functional analyses of sxl, ix and tra2
we performed gene knockdowns via rnai during the prepupal period, which is the critical period of sex-specific mandibular tissue proliferation in the stag beetle  <cit> . knockdown of cmtra <dig> resulted in death in both sexes ; all of the dsrna injected larvae died during the prepupal period. knockdown of cmsxl did not show any detectable abnormalities in morphology in either sex . in contrast to these two early acting genes, knockdown of cmix significantly affected sex-specific morphological characters such as mandible size and body color in females , as predicted from its role in terminal differentiation in drosophila. specifically, mandible growth was induced in cmixrnai females compared with control gfprnai females . those cmixrnai female phenotypes exhibited phenotypes identical to the cmdsxrnai female phenotypes across all affected traits . also, dark non-metallic brown female body color was changed to be more male-like golden metallic color in cmixrnai females . in contrast, cmixrnai males did not show any detectable effects .fig.  <dig> rnai phenotypes of cmdsx isoforms, cmix and cmsxl. each scatter plot panel indicates the scaling relationship between prothorax width  and mandible length . gfp

identification of undescribed dsx variants by race
although we were unable to locate a dsx homolog sequence in our database, we identified cmdsx sequences by degenerate pcr and subsequent race-pcr in a previous study  <cit> . in gotoh et al. , we described the sex specific expression pattern and function of four cmdsx splice variants  <cit> . however, other recent reports of dsx genes from other beetle species identified a larger number of dsx splice variants than we reported , thus we tried to clone potential unidentified cmdsx splice variants by race-pcr. we identified  <dig> additional splice variants . we discovered five new exons at the 3’ end of our previously described variants. these five exons have variation in their combination, which leads to variation in the 3’ utr among the splice variants . our new sequence information also caused us to divide and rename exons  <dig> and  <dig> to exon 8a, 8b and exon 9a, 9b. in females, the specific variants of cmdsx c <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> lack exon 8b, 9a and 9b, and variants c <dig> and d <dig> lack exon 9b. all of the variants including newly identified exons appeared as faint minor bands during race-pcr, while previously identified variants appeared as strong, clear bands . although we found these variations in 3’ utr length among our  <dig> splice variants, the number of putative protein products  is still four . we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr using exon-specific primers  to get a profile of expression patterns for these cmdsx splice variants during development. rt-pcr expression analyses showed that all of exons 9b,  <dig> and  <dig> were used in both males and females, although each variant had sex-specific patterns of expression . some of variants were not detected by rt-pcr. for example dna bands corresponding to c <dig> and d <dig> were not amplified in rt-pcr using f1-r <dig> primer pair , probably due to low expression levels.fig.  <dig> predicted gene models for cmdsx gene. in addition to the previously reported four splice variants , we identified  <dig> new splice variants of dsx in cyclommatus metallifer. we updated the exon number from those reported in gotoh et al. . exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> were divided into 8a, 8b and 9a, 9b, respectively . also, five new exons were named . coding sequences are indicated in gray, arrows indicate forward and reverse primer locations for rt-pcr

functional analyses of splice variant specific knockdown of cmdsx on sex-specific growth of mandibles
the developmental function of cmdsx was previously tested using rnai against a common region  to knockdown all cmdsx isoforms  <cit> . in this study, we more precisely determined the specific function of each cmdsx splice variant using exon-specific rnai. we designed dsrna against cmdsx exon  <dig>  exon 6– <dig>  exon 8a–8b  and exon 9a–9b  which enabled us to knock down each isoform specifically.

in males, only cmdsx-exon  <dig> knockdown affected male-specific morphology, including mandible length . there was no significant difference in the scaling relationship between cmdsx-exon 9rnai males and exon 1rnai males in mandible size , while cmdsx-exon 9rnai males had significantly shorter mandibles compared to gfprnai controls in our observed body size range . normal development of other male-specific traits such as the tibial spines and body color were also affected by cmdsx-exon 9rnai. in contrast, knockdown of cmdsx-exon  <dig>  exon 6– <dig> and exon  <dig> did not affect male mandible scaling relationships , or tibial spines or body color at detectable levels . in females, cmdsx-exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> knockdown did not affect morphology . there were no significant differences in mandible size compared with gfprnai control females . in contrast, cmdsx-exon  <dig> knockdown transformed females to an intersex morphology ; mandibles were relatively longer than those of gfprnai control females . knockdown of cmdsx-exon  <dig> in females also slightly, but significantly, increased mandible length. there was no significant difference for the regression slopes between gfp and cmdsx-exon 9rnai females , but the intercepts of these regression lines differed significantly .

discussion
transcriptome assembly and annotation
the stag beetle c. metallifer transcriptomic database we have constructed is a valuable new resource for molecular screening and candidate gene identification in comparative studies of insect biology, particularly those involving exaggerated, sexually selected and sexually dimorphic structures. our transcriptomic database covers more than 50 % of the total genes in the genome of c. metallifer, based on the number of genes predicted based on the tribolium castaneum genome  and other holometabolous insect genomes . accordingly, more than half  of the genes in the drosophila sex determination cascade were contained in our assembled database, suggesting that our database is a useful platform for molecular screening and candidate gene identification in this species. in this study, we extracted rnas from larval and prepupal heads and thoraces of both sexes. although this time period is critical to organ growth, and was selected to investigate exaggerated mandible growth  <cit> , future studies may wish to focus on other time periods  and other body parts , in order to recover additional genes expressed in this species.

insights for the evolution of insect sex-determination mechanisms and development of sexually dimorphic weapons
expression and functional analyses of three c. metallifer genes in the drosophila sex determination pathway revealed both diversifications of function  as well as conservation  at least in postembryonic sexual character development. our results are the first report of expression and functional analysis of the sxl gene in a beetle species. sxl acts as one of the earliest selector genes for sex determination in drosophila  <cit> . functional drosophila sxl is produced only in females, which splice downstream tra mrna to the functional female isoforms  <cit> . in addition to controlling the sex-specific splicing of tra transcripts, sxl also promotes its own expression, using an auto-regulatory splicing loop, and activates downstream genes such as tra <dig> and dsxf to establish female identity  <cit> . since sxl also regulates female-specific dosage compensation, loss-of-function mutants of sxl are lethal only in females  <cit> . however, outside of flies, the function of sxl in other insects is not well known  <cit> . we found uniform expression and no detectable defect in knockdown animals suggesting that cmsxl does not have a significant role in postembryonic sexual character development in male or female c. metallifer. these results are consistent with previous expression and functional studies in non-drosophilid flies and lepidopteran insects, suggesting that the sxl sex determination function is not a common mechanism among insects  <cit>  and likely evolved in the drosophilid lineage. although cmsxl did not have a phenotype when knocked down early in the prepupal period of c. metallifer, to fully understand its function it will be necessary to investigate additional developmental stages, especially in early embryos when the initial sex-determination signal is likely to function.

knockdown of the rna binding protein tra <dig> had lethal effects in c. metallifer, so we could not examine its effects on adult sexually dimorphic traits. in drosophila, tra <dig> functions as a co-factor with tra for splicing dsx transcripts to female-specific dsx mrna  <cit> . when tra <dig> is not present, tra fails to splice dsx into the female specific transcript, resulting in a male-like phenotype. this sex-specific splicing function of tra <dig> is conserved in other insects such as apis mellifera  <cit>  and tribolium castaneum  <cit> . based on these data, we predicted that cmtra2rnai would transform females to a more male-like phenotype in the stag beetle. however, contrary to our prediction, all of the cmtra2rnai male and female larvae died during the prepupal periods without molting into pupae. similar non-sex specific lethality of tra <dig> rnai was also reported from the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum  <cit>  and the honeybee apis mellifera  <cit> . shukla and palli  have suggested that tra <dig> and tra inhibit the formation of the dosage compensation complex in females and tra <dig> is necessary for the formation of the dosage compensation complex in males  <cit> . however, this hypothesis has not been tested. additional details of the role of tra <dig> during development need to be examined to understand the multiple functions of this gene in insects.

in addition to cmtra <dig>  we also identified a putative homolog of tra from our transcriptome. in many previously studied insects, including tribolium, tra is known as an up-stream regulating factor of dsx-mediated sex-specific alternative splicing  <cit> . only females produce functional tra protein, which results in production of the female-type dsx isoform. the functional tra protein also splices the tra transcript itself. by this positive auto-splicing feedback, female sexuality is fully established  <cit> . on the other hand, in males, non-functional tra protein is produced, and dsx is consequently expressed in the male-specific isoform. considering that cmtra also has two sex-specific isoforms and only the female-specific isoform has a complete auto-regulation domain, female-specific auto-splicing feedback might be conserved in cyclommatus sex-determination. further investigations of cmtra function via rnai and expression analyses of splice patterns of dsx and tra transcripts in cmtra rnai knockdown individuals are necessary for full confirmation of this possibility.

our data support the conserved function of the ix protein as a co-factor with female-specific dsx protein  <cit> . in drosophila females, ix mutant phenotypes are highly similar to dsx mutants, while in males, ix mutants do not show any detectable morphological defects  <cit> . knockdown of the ix gene in the milkweed bug oncopeltus fasciatus affected both male and female genital morphological structures  <cit> . in c. metallifer, cmixrnai affected sex specific trait expression in females only. interestingly, female cmixrnai external morphological phenotypes were not detectably different from cmdsxrnai phenotypes. based on this, we suggest that cmix acts together with cmdsxf to specify female differentiation. although we cannot detect any morphological differences between cmixrnai and wild type males, we did not evaluate the reproductive abilities of these knockdown animals. rt-pcr indicated that cmix is expressed in male tissues, suggesting that it may have some function in males that we did not detect. further analyses on the non-morphological traits such as fertility of males, as well as perturbations at additional developmental periods , will be needed to more fully characterize the role of cmix in males.

sexual differentiation is regulated by sex-specific expression of doublesex isoforms
we identified additional splice variants of the cmdsx gene. all of the new transcripts are predicted to encode one of the four previously described isoforms . in males, neither cmdsx-exon 4rnai nor exon 6-7rnai, which are predicted to knockdown the male biased isoform cmdsxa, affected male morphology. these results suggest that cmdsxa may not have a significant role in male differentiation even though this transcript has a male-biased expression pattern  <cit> . in females, cmdsx-exon 6-7rnai did not cause any detectable phenotypes although it is predicted to be included in female specific isoform cmdsxc.

in contrast to knockdown of cmdsxa and cmdsxc, knockdown of cmdsxb and cmdsxd did influence sex-specific morphogenesis in males and females. in males, cmdsx-exon 9rnai  resulted in a more female-like phenotype . these results suggest that cmdsxb is essential for male differentiation. the amino acid sequence of cmdsxb also has high similarity to male-specific dsx proteins from other beetles  <cit> . in females, c. metallifer cmdsxd specific knockdown  resulted in a more male-like phenotype . thus, in the stag beetle, only cmdsxb and cmdsxd appear critical for generating sex specific morphologies during male and female differentiation. these results indicate a redundancy of cmdsx isoforms in postembryonic sexual differentiation in this species.

redundancy of dsx isoforms has also been reported in other beetle species. for example, in the asian rhinoceros beetle t. dichotomus, two different female specific isoforms of dsx  have been reported  <cit> . however, the t. dichotomus dsxf-short specific knockdown did not cause any detectable deformation phenotype in either sex  <cit> . also, kijimoto et al.  reported that onthophagus taurus has several dsx isoforms and knockdown of one of them  did not produce any noticeable morphological defects  <cit> . it is possible that these isoforms are not redundant, but play critical roles in sex determination during embryonic development or in reproductive trait development such as functional spermatogenesis and oocyte development, but these have yet to be measured. another possibility is that these isoforms have functions in non-morphological sexual characters such as mating behavior. for example, it is known that the sex-determination cascade regulates expression and splice patterns of the gene fruitless  in drosophila  <cit> . coordinated actions of fru and dsx are necessary for male-specific neural development for adult male sexual behaviors  <cit> . future functional analyses of cmdsxa and cmdsxc focusing on other non-morphological traits will be needed to understand the dsx molecular evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome we generated for the prepupal development period in the stag beetle is a useful and important resource for identifying genes involved in morphological evolution including the regulation of sex determination and sexual dimorphism. the ability to identify and functionally screen entire suites of candidate genes, such as those in the sex determination pathway, is a powerful step toward a deeper understanding of both the diversification as well as the conservation of developmental mechanisms in the evolution of complex traits.
