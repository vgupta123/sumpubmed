BACKGROUND
the innate immune response to gram-negative bacterial infections is initiated by the recognition of lipopolysaccharide , a principal component of the cell membrane that is released during bacteriolysis. during systemic infections, lps ligation to the hepatic toll-like receptor- <dig> complex induces the production of a wide variety of hepatic acute phase proteins that are involved in the host response to infection and limit the associated inflammatory process  <cit> . the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines for example, plays an important role in the induction of the febrile and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to lps  <cit> . the liver's role in lps removal and metabolism is also well recognized  <cit> , and likely helps to protect the lungs from acute injury during endotoxemia  <cit> . given this, the identification of genes that regulate the hepatic response to lps in ruminants may provide insight into the pathogenesis of bacterial diseases and eventually facilitate breeding of more disease resistant animals.

a number of studies have previously used microarrays to study hepatic gene expression in rats, mice and dogs challenged with lps; homologous arrays were used in these studies  <cit> . to date however, only two ruminant microarray studies have been performed with bovine cells stimulated with lps, and these studies were performed in vitro  <cit> .with respect to sheep, ovine microarrays are not currently available. however, two different groups have constructed bovine immune-related cdna microarrays that hybridize with ovine cdna  <cit> . these bovine cdna microarrays may therefore, be useful for assessing ovine hepatic gene expression in response to systemic lps challenge.

dna microarray technology is a powerful and frequently used tool for studying differential gene expression. in comparison to quantitative pcr, one of the significant challenges presented by dna microarray analysis is having sufficient amounts of high quality rna that can be labelled and subsequently hybridized onto microarrays. this often requires that animals be euthanized to collect sufficient tissue for rna extraction, which prohibits the assessment of temporal changes in gene expression in vivo. in this study, we amplified total rna that was isolated from liver biopsy samples and profiled the expression of ovine hepatic genes in response e. coli lps challenge  using bovine cdna microarrays and quantitative real-time pcr .

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes in lps challenged animals
gene expression analyses were performed using  <dig> arrays. statistical analysis revealed that  <dig> of genes on the array were differentially expressed between the control and lps-treated animals  . the relative expression of adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor , interferon α receptor , cd <dig> , monocyte-chemoattractant protein  <dig>  and growth hormone  genes was increased, while complement component- <dig> , myeloid membrane glycoprotein , insulin-like growth factor binding protein- <dig> , interleukin  <dig> receptor , natural resistance-associated macrophage protein- <dig>  and superoxide dismutase  gene expression was decreased in the lps-treated animals. overall, the fold change in gene expression for all of these genes was low , even though the signal intensity of mcp- <dig>  sod, acthr, il12r and nramp <dig> was relatively high  from the microarray slides.

one of the principle complications in microarray analysis of gene expression is the relatively large amount of rna required for each array. on average, 5– <dig> μg of total rna are required per study. this is easily obtained from tissue samples collected from euthanized animals, but is more difficult to obtain from small volume biopsy samples collected from live animals. in this study, the senseamp kit  was chosen to amplify total rna. goff et al.  <cit>  evaluated sense-strand mrna amplification by quantitative real-time pcr analysis. their results demonstrated that the senseamp kit yields the highest correlation between pcr products before and after amplification, and is also able to accurately amplify partially degraded samples.

validated expression of selected genes by quantitative real-time pcr
validation of the microarray results by qrt-pcr was performed on the cd <dig>  ifnαr, c <dig>  nramp <dig>  sod, mcp- <dig>  and igfbp <dig> genes . two housekeeping genes, gapdh and rplpo were also selected. results from this analysis generally support the microarray data . linear orthogonal polynomial contrasts  across dose were significant for cd <dig> , nramp <dig> , sod , igfbp <dig> , and the gapdh housekeeping gene , indicating that the expression of these genes was reduced across lps doses. gapdh has also recently been reported to not be a reliable hepatic housekeeping gene for rats challenged with lps  <cit> . lopcs across doses was also significant for mcp- <dig> , indicating that the expression of this gene was increased across lps doses. a significant quadratic orthogonal polynomial contrast across dose was also noted for ifnαr , indicating that the highest expression of this gene was observed at the  <dig> ng/kg lps treatment level. a significant change in the expression of c <dig> and the rplpo housekeeping gene across lps doses was not observed.

the hepatic genes studied are either involved in lps recognition, or in regulating the inflammatory response that occurs following lps recognition. cd <dig> for example, plays a key role in lps recognition during bacterial infection. lps ligation to cd14-tlr <dig> complex subsequently activates numerous cell types to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines including il- <dig>  recent studies performed with bovine mac-t cells  <cit> , and rat lung  <cit>  and liver tissues  <cit>  have shown that cd <dig> expression levels were largely unaffected by lps. an earlier rodent study however, reported up-regulation of cd <dig> 3-hours, but not 6-hours post-challenge with  <dig> μg/kg of lps administered i.v  <cit> . previously, our group demonstrated that ovine cd <dig> gene expression increased significantly  <dig> hours, but not  <dig> hours after systemic challenge with  <dig> and  <dig> ng/kg of lps  <cit> . in the present study, cd <dig> gene expression was reduced at the 5-hour sampling time. these results and others suggest that lps induces tissue-specific and temporal differences in cd <dig> gene expression.

nramp <dig> functions as a proton/divalent cation transporter in the membranes of the late endosomes/lysosomes, regulating cytoplasmic iron levels in macrophages, and plays a role in host innate immunity  <cit> . nramp <dig> gene expression is dramatically increased in murine macrophages treated with lps in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , and its expression is both time- and dose-dependent  <cit> . a study by wyllie et al. demonstrated using nramp <dig> knockout mice that hepatic nramp <dig> expression is important for inducing early phase kupffer cell activation and hepatic inflammation  <cit> . the lps dose-dependent down regulation of nramp <dig> gene expression observed in the current study may be part of a regulatory mechanism designed to control lps-induced inflammation in the liver.

as a group of metal-containing enzymes, sods have a vital anti-oxidant role conferred by their scavenging of the reactive oxygen species  <cit> . a previous study using rats demonstrated that sod activity decreased in the liver during the acute phase of an in vivo lps challenge and then increased during the recovery phase. similar findings were reported with hepatocytes exposed to lps in vitro in the same study  <cit> . a microarray study using liver tissue from rats challenged with lps demonstrated induction of the sod <dig> gene  <dig> hours post lps challenge however, no assessment was made at earlier time points  <cit> . the dose-dependent decrease in sod gene expression that was observed in the present study 4– <dig> hours post lps challenge, combined with these previously reported studies, suggest that sod gene expression varies temporally in the liver following lps challenge.

igfbps regulate the bioactivity of mitogenic igf-i and may also inhibit the growth of certain cell lines by an igf-i receptor-independent pathway  <cit> . priego et al. reported that lps decreased the gene expression of igfbp- <dig> in the rat liver following in vivo challenge  <cit> . our results confirm their results using an ovine lps challenge model.

mcp- <dig> is an important leukocyte chemoattractant that is involved in recruiting neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages during inflammation. several studies have shown that lps induces mcp- <dig> gene expression in various tissues both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . two different lps studies performed in vivo using the rat  <cit>  and canine models  <cit>  made no mention of hepatic mcp- <dig> induction using microarray analysis, although another chemokine, mip- <dig>  was reportedly induced  <dig> hours post lps challenge in the canine model  <cit> . a recent study however, reported hepatic mcp- <dig> protein expression in mice challenged with lps  <cit> . our study demonstrates that lps also induced hepatic mcp- <dig> gene expression in sheep.

all ifn subtypes are multifunctional cytokines that exhibit differential activities through a common receptor composed of the subunits ifnαr <dig> and ifnαr <dig>  <cit> . in this study we found that the expression of ifnαr <dig> gene was induced after lps treatment, but the highest expression was observed at the  <dig> ng/kg lps treatment level. a study by severa et al., demonstrated that human mature dendritic cells modulate their sensitivity to ifn subtypes by differentially regulating the ifnαr subunits  <cit> . future studies on ifnαr may help us understand its role during lps-induced hepatic inflammation.

c <dig> is a key molecule in both the classical and alternative pathways of the complement cascade. the expression of the c <dig> gene appears to be dependent on lps dose, sampling time, and cell type. lps has been reported to induce c <dig> gene expression for example, in a human hepatoma cell line in vitro  <cit>  and in human mononuclear phagocytes and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro  <cit> . others however, have reported that c <dig> gene expression is decreased in monocytes stimulated with lps  <cit> , and that c <dig> protein expression follows a bell shaped curve when monocytes are stimulated in vitro with lps between  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . in the present study we report that c <dig> expression is suppressed in the ovine liver as determined by microarray analysis. unfortunately, there was insufficient power to validate these results by qrt-pcr analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have identified several potentially important genes that are differentially expressed during the ovine inflammatory response to lps challenge using bovine cdna microarray and qrt-pcr analyses. their potential role in regulating inflammation warrants further investigation. a comparison of these results to those reported in the literatures suggest that hepatic gene expression in response to lps is dependent on multiple factors including species, tissue, sampling time, the dose and type of lps.
