BACKGROUND
most living cells maintain low na+ ion concentration in the cytoplasm even when the extracellular environment contains a high level of na+ ions. for cells thriving in a high na+ ion concentration, there occurs a passive flux of na+ ions into the cells and this increases the cytoplasmic na+ concentration  <cit> . hypersaline conditions can be deleterious to cells since water is lost to the external medium until osmotic equilibrium is achieved. to adjust the internal osmotic status to enable cells to survive in hypersaline environments, the cells have a mechanism to accumulate compatible low-molecular-weight solutes. the types of these solutes can vary depending on organisms, for example, ectoine in chromohalobacter israelensis   <cit> , glycine betaine in aphanothece halophytica  <cit> , glucosylglycerol in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , glycerol in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , and trehalose in desulfovibrio halophilus  <cit> . another mechanism for adaptation to high salinity is extrusion of excessive na+ ions accumulated in the cytoplasm out of the cells  <cit> . the well-known mechanism for na+ extrusion is by na+/h+ antiporters which utilize a h+ gradient generated by h+-atpase catalyzing the movement of na+ ions across the membrane by exchanging internal na+ with external h+  <cit> . another mechanism for na+ transport under high salinity, and at alkaline ph, employs a na+-atpase or a primary na+ pump  <cit> . na+-atpase plays an important role in the maintenance of the na+ ion concentration of cells by coupling the hydrolysis of atp to the translocation of na+ ions across the cell membrane. na+-atpase is found in bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae, and halophytic higher plants  <cit> . p-type na+-atpases were found in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , exiguobacterium aurantiacum  <cit> , heterosigma akashiwo  <cit>  and tetraselmis viridis  <cit> . v-type na+-atpases were found in caloramator fervidus  <cit>  and enterococcus hirae  <cit> . f-type na+-atpases were found in acetobacterium woodii  <cit> , clostridium paradoxum  <cit> , ilyobacter tartaricus  <cit>  and propionigenium modestum  <cit> . however, the information on the atpase involved in na+ transport is scarce in cyanobacteria.

aphanothece halophytica is an alkaliphilic halotolerant cyanobacterium that can grow in a wide range of salinity conditions from  <dig> - <dig>  m nacl with an alkaline condition as high as ph  <dig>   <cit> . intracellular cation levels for a. halophytica mainly na+ and k+ have been reported to be within the range of 260- <dig> mm depending on the external salinities  <cit> . previously we reported the presence of a na+-stimulated atpase in the plasma membrane of a. halophytica  <cit> . the membrane vesicles could take up na+ when supplied with atp. in the halotolerant microalga dunaliella maritima, it was found that na+ uptake across the plasma membrane by na+-atpase is electrogenic  <cit>  and the mechanism of na+ transport by na+-atpase is suggested to operate as an na+ uniporter which carries only na+ ions for transport across the plasma membrane while the transport of h+, a counterion, is driven by an electrical membrane potential generated by na+-atpase  <cit> . on the contrary, the mechanism of na+ transport across the plasma membrane of the marine microalga tetraselmis viridis by na+-atpase is suggested to operate as an na+/h+ exchanger which catalyzes an exchange of na+ for h+  <cit> . in this study, na+-stimulated atpase from a. halophytica was purified and reconstituted into liposomes. the resultant proteoliposomes were used to test whether atp-dependent na+ uptake by na+-stimulated atpase was accompanied with h+ transport. in addition, the nature of coupling between atp-dependent na+ transport and h+ flux mediated by na+-stimulated atpase in a. halophytica was investigated.

RESULTS
effect of salinity and ph of growth medium on atpase activity
since a. halophytica is a halotolerant and alkaliphilic cyanobacterium, it is of interest to investigate the changes of atpase activity in response to changes of nacl concentration and ph of the growth medium. increasing nacl concentration in the growth medium up to  <dig> m led to a progressive increase of atpase activity in the membrane vesicles . higher atpase activity was observed in cells grown at high ph than at low ph at all four concentrations of nacl tested. when the cells were grown at different ph values, atpase activity in the membrane vesicles was slightly increased upon increasing the ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . a marked increase of enzyme activity was evident at ph higher than  <dig> . cells grown at  <dig> m nacl showed higher enzyme activity than those grown at  <dig>  m nacl at all four ph values tested.

purification of atpase
atpase is a membrane protein, hence it is necessary to find optimum conditions to solubilize the atpase from the membranes. treatment of membrane vesicles with  <dig> mm sodium cholate for  <dig> min resulted in the highest yield of atpase .

the two-step purification, peg  <dig> precipitation followed by superose  <dig> gel filtration, resulted in a  <dig> -fold purified enzyme with  <dig> % yield . it is noteworthy that more than 85% atpase activity was recovered in the solubilized membrane protein suggesting that nearly all atpase proteins were solubilized in their native forms. the enzyme was stable up to one month at -20°c. sds-page analysis  revealed some polypeptide bands which could tentatively be identified as atpase subunits of an f-type atpase, namely α , β , γ , a , b , δ , ε  and c  based on the comparison with the typical mobilities and band pattern of an f-type atpase subunits from both ilyobacter tartaricus  <cit>  and thermoalkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain ta <dig> a <dig>  <cit> . the subunit c was further characterized by cutting the band on sds-page  and digesting with trypsin before analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry . the spectra were recorded on an esi-q-tof mass spectrometer . the amino acid sequences of the peptides were obtained using mascot program . one resultant tryptic peptide "issgaegiar" with the molecular mass of  <dig> , by searching the national center for biotechnology information  database, was highly identical to the sequence of f-type atpase subunit c of synechococcus sp. wh  <dig> , synechococcus sp. cc <dig> , synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  and gloeobacter violaceus  with % identity of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 60%, respectively.

a one unit corresponded to  <dig> nmol of inorganic phosphate produced per min.

catalytic properties of the purified atpase
the activity of atpase as influenced by various cations was tested and the results are shown in figure 3a. increasing na+ concentration up to  <dig> mm caused a progressive increase in enzyme activity. k+, li+, and ca2+ had no stimulatory effect on enzyme activity. the apparent km value for na+ as determined from the lineweaver-burk plot was  <dig> mm . it is noteworthy that only marginal activity was detected in the absence of na+ accounting for about 10% of the maximum activity. figure 3b shows that atpase activity increased as atp increased and the activity was saturated at about  <dig> mm atp. the apparent km value for atp was  <dig>  mm .

the dependence of atpase on mg2+ was also tested. figure 3c shows that maximal atpase activity was observed at  <dig> mm mg2+. the enzyme activity was slightly decreased when the mg2+ concentration was higher than  <dig> mm. the ph of the assay medium also influenced the enzyme activity. when the ph was increased from ph  <dig>  to ph  <dig> , the enzyme activity was increased progressively . increasing the ph further to ph  <dig>  resulted in a slightly declined enzyme activity. the observation that high activity of atpase occurred at alkaline ph as high as ph  <dig>  prompted us to investigate further the effect of na+ on the stimulation of atpase activity at different ph values. maximal stimulation of atpase activity occurred at  <dig> mm nacl when assayed at ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the enzyme was stimulated about 9-fold at ph  <dig>  and about 11-fold at both ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  with  <dig> mm nacl.

effect of inhibitors on atpase activity
the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone , the v-type atpase inhibitors n-ethylmaleimide , kno <dig> and kscn, had no inhibitory effect on atpase activity . ouabain, an animal na+/k+-atpase inhibitor and orthovanadate, an inhibitor of p-type atpase, also did not inhibit atpase activity. amiloride, a potent inhibitor of many na+-coupled transport systems including na+/h+ antiporters, had no effect on atpase activity. sodium azide, an f <dig> inhibitor and n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide , an f <dig> inhibitor, inhibited atpase activity by about  <dig> and 20%, respectively.

atp hydrolytic activity was assayed in the reaction mixture containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm nacl and the purified atpase . the reaction was started by the addition of  <dig> mm atp . each inhibitor was added to the reaction mixture  <dig> min before the start of the reaction. one hundred percent activity corresponded to  <dig> nmol min- <dig> - <dig> 

the weak inhibition of atpase activity by dccd was due to the presence of  <dig> mm nacl during the assay of atpase activity. indeed, strong inhibition by dccd in the absence of nacl occurred after  <dig> min yielding  <dig> and 70% inhibition at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> , respectively . the presence of  <dig> mm nacl during incubation with dccd had no  or little  protection against dccd inhibition. however, increasing the concentration of nacl led to the reduction of the inhibition by dccd on atpase activity for both conditions at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . stronger protection was observed at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig> . treatment with dccd for  <dig> min in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl resulted in approximately  <dig> and 50% inhibition at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the presence of  <dig> mm licl or kcl during incubation with dccd afforded no protection against dccd inhibition .

catalytic properties of proteoliposomes
the purified na+-atpase from a. halophytica reconstituted into proteoliposomes by a freeze-thaw/dilution method was characterized. the tests for the effects of cations, atp, mg2+, ph and inhibitors on atpase activity of reconstituted proteoliposomes yielded similar results to those of the purified enzyme .

transport of na+ into proteoliposomes
the transport of na+ into proteoliposomes reconstituted with atpase increased with increasing concentration of nacl with an apparent saturation at about  <dig> mm nacl  and the apparent km value for na+ of  <dig>  mm . moreover, na+ accumulated in the proteoliposomes after the addition of atp while no significant uptake of na+ was detected in the absence of atp . an increase in atp concentration resulted in an increase of na+ transport reaching saturation at about  <dig> mm atp. the apparent km value for atp was estimated to be  <dig>  mm .

the time course of na+ uptake into proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified atpase is shown in figure  <dig>  in the absence of atp, na+ uptake was very low but upon the addition of atp the uptake was significantly accelerated. the atp-dependent na+ uptake was strongly inhibited by gramicidin d and monensin while a protonophore cccp and the permeant anion nitrate stimulated the uptake of na+.

detection of h+ efflux from proteoliposomes
in order to investigate whether na+ uptake into the proteoliposomes is accompanied with h+ efflux from the proteoliposomes, alkalization of the proteoliposome lumen was detected using the Δph probe acridine orange with a pka of  <dig> . addition of atp to the reaction medium containing nacl at  <dig> mm initiated h+ efflux from the proteoliposome lumen to the outer medium . this h+ efflux was atp concentration-dependent. the protonophore cccp induced atp-dependent lumen alkalization while the permeant anion nitrate suppressed atp-dependent lumen alkalization. when na+ in the reaction medium was replaced with k+, li+ and ca2+, the atp-dependent alkalization of the proteoliposome lumen was not observed .

detection of membrane potential
to investigate the nature of coupling of na+ and h+ fluxes upon the addition of atp to proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified atpase, the role of membrane potential in the atp-dependent h+ translocation was studied with a voltage-sensitive probe oxonol vi. figure 9a shows the generation of membrane potential  upon the addition of atp to the reaction medium containing  <dig> mm nacl. the generation of membrane potential was further enhanced when  <dig> mm nacl was added. these results indicated that the membrane potential was built up by the operation of a na+-stimulated atpase. on the contrary, both the protonophore cccp and the permeant anion nitrate collapsed the membrane potential built up by na+-stimulated atpase. figure 9b shows that the increase in membrane potential generation was na+ concentration-dependent.

discussion
there have been studies of atpases associated with various cations such as ca2+, cu2+, k+ and mg2+ in a number of cyanobacteria  <cit> . however, atpase involved in na+ transport has not been directly demonstrated experimentally in cyanobacteria. in this study, we focused on the involvement of atpase in na+ homeostasis in the alkaliphilic halotolerant cyanobacterium a. halophytica. high atpase activity detected in membrane vesicles of cells grown under high salinity and high ph conditions  suggested that atpase from a. halophytica plays a role in the response of cells against an increase in salinity and ph. similar observations were found in streptococcus faecalis, tetraselmis viridis, and heterosigma akashiwo  <cit> . furthermore, we also found that a. halophytica requires na+ for its growth. the presence of gramicidin d, an ionophore that dissipates na+-gradients, in the growth medium resulted in the cessation of cell growth . these results are in agreement with those previously reported in a facultative anaerobic alkaliphile m- <dig>  which utilized sodium motive force  generated by a sodium pump for active transport of solutes while other alkaliphiles produced Δμna+ by a na+/h+ antiporter which is a secondary transport system for na+  <cit> .

to investigate na+ transport in relation to atpase activity in a. halophytica, the atpase was purified and was tentatively classified as an f-type atpase. this is based on the results that its activity was inhibited by azide and dccd, which are inhibitors of f1f0-atpase but not by orthovanadate and nitrate which are inhibitors of p-type and v-type atpases, respectively . dccd is believed to inhibit f-type atpase due to the binding of dccd to a highly conserved carboxyl residue in the c subunit of the f <dig> portion  <cit> . the band pattern of the purified enzyme analyzed by sds-page as shown in figure  <dig> was comparable to the typical mobilities and band pattern of f-type atpase subunits from both ilyobacter tartaricus  <cit>  and a thermoalkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain ta <dig> a <dig>  <cit> . the polypeptide bands could tentatively be identified as atpase subunits of an f-type atpase, namely: α , β , γ , a , b , δ , ε  and c . moreover, the band tentatively identified as f-type atpase subunit c of a. halophytica was confirmed by lc-ms/ms analysis. one of the obtained sequences after trypsin digestion namely "issgaegiar" was found to be highly identical to the partial sequence of f-type atpase subunit c of at least four strains of cyanobacteria, namely synechococcus sp. wh  <dig>  synechococcus sp. cc <dig>  synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and gloeobacter violaceus. overall, the results from the inhibitor effects, and the typical subunits band pattern as well as the protection by na+ against dccd inhibition of atpase activity , suggest that the atpase from a. halophytica is likely a member of the f-type atpases. immunological studies as well as the analysis of the n-termini of different subunits can help establish the actual class of atpase from a. halophytica. further characterization of the na+-stimulated atpase in a. halophytica by genetic manipulations is now under way.

the purified atpase from a. halophytica was reconstituted into liposomes to investigate the possible role of na+-stimulated atpase on the transport of na+. the reconstituted atpase showed catalytic properties, namely km's of na+ and atp identical to those of the purified atpase. moreover, an increase in the concentration of nacl and atp led to an increase in na+ uptake by the proteoliposomes . these results suggest the presence of an atp-dependent na+ pump in the proteoliposomes. the substrate atp was hydrolyzed by atpase to provide a driving force for na+ uptake. a previous report demonstrated the function of na+-atpase as a na+ pump in the plasma membrane of the marine alga heterosigma akashiwo based on the similarity of the kinetic properties of na+ transport and na+-atpase activity  <cit> . in a. halophytica, the apparent km value of na+ transport for na+ and atp were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively. these values are close to the apparent km values of na+-stimulated atpase activity for na+  and atp . this indicates that the purified atpase from a. halophytica is indeed a na+ pump. the uptake of na+ into proteoliposomes was abolished by gramicidin d and monensin whereas a protonophore cccp and the permeant anion nitrate had a stimulatory effect on na+ uptake . these results suggest the operation of electrogenic na+ transport by na+-stimulated atpase in a. halophytica. moreover, atp-dependent na+ uptake by proteoliposomes was a primary and not a secondary event, i.e. the transport was not catalyzed by a na+/h+ antiporter or other secondary events driven by proton potential.

as observed in figure 8a, na+ uptake by atpase is associated with h+ efflux in a. halophytica. previously, the marine alga tetraselmis viridis was shown to contain na+-atpase capable of translocating na+ into plasma membrane vesicles which was accompanied by h+ efflux with the consequence of the alkalization of the vesicle lumen  <cit> . in this study, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism of na+- and h+-transport by na+-stimulated atpase reconstituted into liposomes. two possible mechanisms of na+-transport can be hypothesized  <cit> . mechanism  <dig> proposes that the na+-stimulated atpase operates as a uniporter catalyzing only na+ transport across proteoliposomes, subsequently, h+ transport is driven by the membrane potential generated by na+-stimulated atpase. mechanism  <dig> proposes that the na+-stimulated atpase operates as an antiporter catalyzing an exchange of na+ for h+.

to distinguish between these two mechanisms, we studied the role of membrane potential in atp-dependent h+ translocation. the dissipation of membrane potential would result in complete suppression of h+ efflux, if the membrane potential across the proteoliposome generated by na+-stimulated atpase were the only driving force for h+ extrusion. on the other hand, if h+ efflux occurred directly via the na+- stimulated atpase as an antiporter by exchanging na+ for h+, the dissipation of the membrane potential would not suppress h+ efflux  <cit> . a permeant anion, nitrate, that generally penetrates easily across biological membranes down its electrochemical gradient is often used as a charge-compensating anion to abolish membrane potential  across proteoliposomes during the measurements of atp-driven h+ translocation. if nitrate inhibits the atp-dependent alkalization of the proteoliposome lumen and promotes both dissipation of membrane potential and atp-dependent na+ uptake, it can be concluded that atp- and na+-dependent h+ efflux from proteoliposomes is driven by the membrane potential generated by na+-atpase. hence, na+-atpase operates as a uniporter carrying only na+, and h+ is not involved in the catalytic cycle of this enzyme. on the contrary, if nitrate increases both atp-dependent alkalization of the proteoliposome lumen and na+ uptake while membrane potential is dissipated, it can be concluded that na+-stimulated atpase operates as an antiporter catalyzing na+/h+ exchange.

our results are consistent with mechanism  <dig> by which the purified na+-stimulated atpase operates as a uniporter. the atp-dependent na+ uptake in proteoliposomes was accelerated in the presence of cccp and nitrate  and both agents dissipated membrane potential generated by na+-stimulated atpase . cccp stimulated atp-dependent alkalization of proteoliposomes while nitrate inhibited this alkalization . only na+ but not k+, li+ and ca2+ promoted h+ efflux . the results indicate that h+ efflux from proteoliposomes is driven by the membrane potential generated by na+-stimulated atpase and is specific for na+. moreover, this dependence of lumen alkalization on na+ coincided with the requirement of na+ but not k+, li+ and ca2+ on atpase activity . therefore, we can conclude that 1) na+- stimulated atpase from a. halophytica operates as a uniporter which takes up only na+ while h+ is counterion and 2) atp-dependent lumen alkalization occurred as a result of the operation of the na+-stimulated atpase. h+ efflux does not occur directly via na+-stimulated atpase but is driven by the membrane potential generated during na+-stimulated atpase operation. the operation of na+-stimulated atpase as a na+ uniporter has been previously reported in the halotolerant microalga dunaliella maritima  <cit>  while na+-translocating atpase in the marine microalga tetraselmis viridis operates as a na+/h+ exchanger  <cit> .

despite the fact that several potential na+-atpases have been implicated in cyanobacteria, the existence of a na+-atpase responsible for na+ movement has not been experimentally demonstrated. recent studies in the genome of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> showed that the disruption of a gene cluster encoding a putative na+-atpase subunit led to high nacl sensitivity of the mutant suggesting the role of na+-atpase in salt resistance  <cit> . brown et al.  <cit>  reported that nacl could stimulate light-supported generation of membrane potential in the marine cyanobacterium oscillatoria brevis. they further suggested that o. brevis might possess a light-dependent primary na+ pump in the cytoplasmic membrane but it is not clear what kind of a primary na+ pump operates in the cytoplasmic membrane of o. brevis. synechococcus r- <dig> pcc  <dig> was postulated to have a primary na+ pump extruding na+ in the light and dark utilizing na+ motive force  <cit> . our study in a. halophytica is the first report that experimentally demonstrates the involvement of na+-stimulated atpase in na+ transport in cyanobacteria using a purified protein incorporated into liposomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the purified na+-stimulated atpase from a. halophytica is likely a member of the f1f <dig> atpase family. the uptake of na+ into proteoliposomes is mediated by this enzyme upon atp hydrolysis. the transport of na+ is electrogenic and operates via a uniport mechanism with h+ countertransport as a secondary event energized by the membrane potential generated by the operation of na+-stimulated atpase.
