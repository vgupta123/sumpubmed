BACKGROUND
the rosaceae is an economically important group of cultivated plants, which includes fruit-producing genera such as malus , pyrus , prunus , fragaria , and rubus , as well as ornamental plants such as rosa . in these fruits and flowers, colour is a key quality trait and is often caused by anthocyanin. anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that belong to the flavonoid family of compounds giving red, blue and purple colours in a range of flowers, fruits, foliage, seeds and roots  <cit> . anthocyanins are involved in a wide range of functions, such as the attraction of pollinators, seed dispersal, protection against uv light damage, and pathogen attack  <cit> . recently, research on anthocyanins has intensified because of their potential benefits to human health, including protection against cancer, inflammation, coronary heart diseases and other age-related diseases  <cit> .

in plants, the structural genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway are largely regulated at the level of transcription. in all species studied to date, the regulation of the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes are through a complex of myb transcription factors , basic helix-loop-helix  tfs and wd-repeat proteins . a model has been proposed for the activation of structural pigmentation genes, with regulators interacting with each other to form transcriptional complexes in conjunction with the promoters of structural genes  <cit> . for example, the r2r <dig> myb c <dig> protein, that regulates the anthocyanin pathway in maize, interacts with a bhlh tf  to activate the promoter of dihydroflavonol reductase . in contrast, the r2r <dig> myb p protein, which regulates the phlobaphene pathway in maize, can activate the same promoter without a bhlh tf  <cit> .

myb tfs can be classified into three subfamilies based on the number of highly conserved imperfect repeats in the dna-binding domain including r <dig> myb  with one repeat, r2r <dig> myb with two repeats, and r1r2r <dig> myb  with three repeats  <cit> . among these myb transcription factors, r2r3-mybs constitute the largest tf gene family in plants, with  <dig> r2r <dig> myb genes identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . those associated with up-regulation of the anthocyanin pathway are r2r <dig> mybs. over-expression of the atpap <dig> gene  results in the accumulation of anthocyanins in arabidopsis  <cit> . several repressors of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and perhaps anthocyanins specifically, are also myb tfs, including an r2r <dig> myb repressor from strawberry famyb <dig>  <cit> , arabidopsis atmyb <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> , antirrhinum ammyb <dig>  <cit> , and a one repeat myb in arabidopsis, atmybl <dig>  <cit> . how the repressor mybs interact with the mbw transcriptional complex is beginning to be elucidated  <cit> .

based on the phylogenetic relationship between arabidopsis r2r <dig> myb tfs and anthocyanin-related mybs of other species, it appears that anthocyanin-regulating r2r <dig> mybs fall into one or two clades  <cit> . anthocyanin-regulating mybs have been isolated from many species, including arabidopsis atmyb <dig> or pap <dig>  atmyb <dig> or pap <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  <cit> , solanum lycopersicum ant <dig>  <cit> , petunia hybrida an <dig>  <cit> , capsicum annuum a  <cit> , vitis vinifera vvmyb1a  <cit> , zea mays p  <cit> , oryza saliva c <dig>  <cit> , ipomoea batatas ibmyb <dig>  <cit> , anitirrhinum majus rosea <dig>  rosea <dig> and venosa  <cit> , gerbera hybrid ghmyb <dig>  <cit> , picea mariana mbf <dig>  <cit> , garcinia mangostana gmmyb <dig>  <cit> , malus × domestica mdmyb <dig>  mdmyb1/mdmyba  <cit> , and gentian gtmyb <dig>  <cit> .

for rosaceous species, mybs that regulate the genes of the anthocyanin pathway have been examined in apple and strawberry. in apple  myb <dig> was isolated from red-fleshed apple 'red field'  <cit> , and showed a strong correlation between the expression of myb <dig> and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development. transgenic apple lines constitutively expressing myb <dig> produced highly pigmented shoots. two more apple tfs, myb <dig> and myba, were also reported to regulate genes in the anthocyanin pathway in red-skinned fruit  <cit> . both myb <dig> and myba share identical sequences  <cit> , while myb <dig> and myb <dig> genes are located at very similar positions on linkage group  <dig> of the apple genetic map  <cit> . in strawberry , the r2r <dig> myb tf famyb <dig> plays a key role in down-regulating the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and flavonols  <cit> .

in this current study, we used an allele-specific pcr primer approach to show that mdmyb1/mdmyba/mdmyb <dig> are highly likely to be allelic in the apple genome. we then isolated genes with high sequence similarity to myb <dig> from  <dig> species within the rosaceae. sequence and functional characterization of these genes provides insight into the evolution of this tf, within a plant family where higher levels of pigmentation has been selected for during the process of domestication. expression analysis during the fruit development, and functional testing using transient assays and transgenic plants suggest that these r2r <dig> mybs are responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in these crops.

RESULTS
the mdmyb10/mdmyb1/mdmyba genes are likely to be allelic
three highly homologous apple genes, myb <dig>  <cit> , myb <dig>  <cit>  and myba  <cit> , have been reported in different cultivars of apple. in order to ascertain whether, in any given cultivar, these represent different genes or are alleles of the one gene, we designed pcr primers to amplify a region of genomic dna common to all three of these genes, spanning a region from the promoter through to exon  <dig> of the published sequences. this region produces an amplification length polymorphism distinguishing the myb <dig> allele present in red-fleshed cultivars from white fleshed types  <cit> . the amplification products from a range of apple varieties are shown in figure 1a. one amplification product of approximately  <dig> bp is observed for the white-fleshed varieties pacific rose™, 'royal gala', and 'granny smith'. two amplification products, of approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, were observed in red-fleshed apple varieties such as 'red field', 'niedzwetzkyana', and 'robert's crab'. with red-fleshed varieties, known to be homologous for the red-flesh gene  <cit> , only the 1000-bp fragment is amplified. these products represent the r <dig> and r <dig> alleles previously reported for myb <dig>  <cit> , and suggests that myb <dig> and myb <dig> are alleles, because if they were paralogues there would still be two products in r6r <dig> homozygous apples.

while these end-point pcr amplifications are not quantitative, the fluorescence from ethidium bromide  indicated that in those tissues where both 900- and 1000-bp fragments are amplified, these molecules are likely to be in equivalent molar quantity within the genome. this is based on the observation that when a mixture of diluted pcr products from the 900-bp and 1000-bp fragments are mixed in ratios of 3: <dig> or 1: <dig> respectively, the etbr fluorescence of the end-point pcr amplifications reflects the corresponding molar ratios . furthermore, pcr analysis of the progeny from crosses made between the r <dig> homozygous pacific rose™ cultivar and the heterozygous r1r <dig> 'red field' shows segregation of the homozygous r <dig> allele and the heterozygous r <dig> and r <dig> alleles . if myb <dig> and myb <dig> were different genes, band intensity ratios of 3: <dig> would be possible but as only 1: <dig> ratios are observed, myb <dig> and myb <dig> are likely to be allelic, representing the r <dig> and r <dig> alleles.

isolation of myb <dig> homologues from the major rosaceous crop species
we isolated both cdna and genomic dna from  <dig> rosaceous species and, using a gene-specific primer approach based on the apple myb <dig> gene sequence, generated pcr fragments for cloning into sequencing vectors. fragments with sequence similarity to myb <dig> were used to obtain full-length sequences for further functional testing. this approach worked well for all the members of the maloideae subfamily  and amygdaloideae subfamily , but not for species of the rosoideae subfamily . for rosoideae, we required additional steps involving 5' and 3' generace of mrna , with degenerate primers designed to the consensus dna sequence of the anthocyanin-related r2r <dig> myb dna binding domain. the rosaceous myb transcription factors isolated, using these approaches, are shown in table  <dig>  and predicted protein sequence is shown in figure  <dig> 

myb transcription factors, homologous to apple mdmyb <dig>  from all the major rosaceous species , and the published anthocyanin myb regulators from other species .

for both protein sequence and coding dna sequence  of rosaceous mybs, the percentage of identity to arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  varied from  <dig> to 64%, and  <dig> to 49%, respectively. the length of cds and protein sequence was similar between each species analysed, but the length of genomic dna  sequence varied significantly from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp . this is due almost entirely to the variable length of intron  <dig>  which ranges from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp . a schematic of myb10-like genes from rosaceous species is shown in additional file  <dig>  the large size of intron  <dig> in apple correlates with its higher dna content than close relatives; apple has almost  <dig>  times more dna mass than pear  <cit> http://www.kew.org/cval/homepage.html. intron  <dig> of apple myb <dig> is  <dig> bp, compared with  <dig> bp in pear .

when the region of homology, corresponding to the myb r2r <dig> domain, was used to generate a phylogenic tree, all the genes clustered with known anthocyanin-related mybs . furthermore, the myb genes clustered according to their taxonomic relationships in the rosaceae . for the maloideae , all clustered together into a clade. for the amygdaloideae , all were clustered into another clade. raspberry, strawberry and rose are the members of the rosoideae and they all clustered together. while the maloideae and amygdaloideae clustered closely together, the rosoideae clustered more distantly.

sequence signatures specific for anthocyanin-related mybs
the large gene family of r2r <dig> myb proteins was examined using conserved regions of homology. over  <dig> proteins were included; all arabidopsis r2r <dig> mybs,  <dig> other dicot anthocyanin-promoting mybs, including apple myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> , strawberry anthocyanin repressor myb <dig>  as well as anthocyanin-related mybs from four monocots and one gymnosperm. all the mybs associated with promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis from dicot species cluster within the same clade as pap <dig> and other arabidopsis mybs of this subgroup . monocot sequences, such as c <dig> and p, as well as the gymnosperm picea mariana mbf <dig>  cluster outside this group, suggesting that this clade is dicot-specific. the function of promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis for this subgroup may therefore have evolved after the divergence between dicots and monocots.

to ascertain if there is an identifiable protein motif specific for anthocyanin-promoting mybs in the n-terminal r2r <dig> domain, the isolated rosaceous mybs and other anthocyanin-promoting mybs  were compared with  <dig> myb peptide sequences of other clades . three amino-acid residues , valine , alanine ; marked with arrows in figure 4a) are conserved for dicot anthocyanin-promoting mybs at a frequency of 100:92: <dig>  none of these amino-acid residues appeared in the other  <dig> sequences at the respective position . another convenient identifier for an anthocyanin-promoting myb appears to be andv  at position  <dig> to  <dig> in the r2r <dig> domain  which is not seen in any other r2r <dig> mybs .

outside of the dna-interacting r2r <dig> domain, most r2r <dig> myb proteins have a long c-terminal sequence. in this region of arabidopsis anthocyanin-promoting mybs, the motif kprpr f has been identified   <cit> , which is not present in other r2r <dig> mybs. when anthocyanin-promoting myb sequences from other species are aligned, this c-terminus consensus motif was still identifiable but with slight variations  to become px xx . within the subfamilies maloideae and amygdeloideae, there was over 70% similarity of c-terminus. an  <dig> amino acid deletion occurred in the c-terminus of both almond and peach  which is within exon  <dig>  indicating that this is not a mis-prediction of an exon-intron boundary. however, this deletion did not disrupt the activity of peach myb <dig> . other anthocyanin-related mybs are known to repress the biosynthetic pathway . these contain c-terminal motifs such as the erf-associated amphiphilic repression  motif or the tlllfr motif  <cit> . such motifs were not found in any of the myb10-like predicted proteins identified in this study.

a conserved amino acid signature   has been shown to be functionally important for the interaction between myb and r/b-like bhlh proteins  <cit> . all rosaceous myb sequences, as well as anthocyanin-related dicot mybs and pmmbf <dig> and c <dig> had this signature. however, other r2r <dig> myb tfs also have this signature . therefore, the presence of this motif is not indicative of the candidate myb being within the anthocyanin-promoting clade, but rather suggests that these mybs require an interacting bhlh partner.

functional assay of rosaceous myb activity
transient luciferase assays in the tobacco species nicotiana benthamiana have been used to assay myb activity against the arabidopsis dfr-promoter . full length cdnas of apple , wild and cultivated strawberry , rose  and raspberry , and genomic dna of pear, european plum, cherry-plum, cherry, apricot, and peach  were cloned into the transient expression vector pgreen ii  <dig> 62k  <cit>  and transfected into agrobacterium. these tfs were then co-infected into n. benthamiana leaves with atdfr-luc in a second agrobacterium strain, with or without a bhlh co-factor in a third agrobacterium strain. trans-activation was assayed  <dig> days later as a change in luc/ren ratio.

as shown in figure 5a, all  <dig> myb10s induced the dfr promoter, but only in the presence of a bhlh partner . in all cases, myb <dig> activity increased to the greatest extent with atbhlh <dig> or atbhlh <dig>  apple myb <dig> performed well with apple bhlhs. with cherry-plum, european plum, apricot, and raspberry, the induction by the myb and bhlh was highly efficient, out-performing 35s:renilla by at least 3-fold. some of the myb <dig> tfs  performed poorly with mdbhlh <dig>  the poorest activator of atdfr-luc, pcmyb <dig>  could enhance transcription of the luc reporter to  <dig>  of 35s:renilla with atbhlh <dig> as a partner. myb <dig>  an apple r2r <dig> myb from an unrelated clade, was included as a negative control. the induction of atdfr-luc by mdmyb <dig>  with atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig>  mdbhlh <dig> or mdbhlh <dig>  was significantly lower than all rosaceous myb10s.

as previously reported  <cit>  a patch of foliar anthocyanin production can be induced in nicotiana tabacum leaves by co-expression of mdmyb <dig> with mdbhlh <dig>  induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by rosaceous myb10s was tested and found to be dependent on the co-expression of the bhlh proteins from arabidopsis or apple. patches of anthocyanin were most apparent with pdmmyb <dig> and pprmyb <dig> when atbhlh <dig> was included as a partner .

expression of rosaceous myb <dig> tfs correlate with anthocyanin biosynthesis
expression of sweet cherry pavmyb <dig> gene transcript was examined using qpcr analysis during fruit development in two cherry cultivars, 'rainier' and 'stella'. these two cultivars differ in the level of anthocyanin that accumulates in mature fruit . at maturity, 'rainier' appears pink as anthocyanin accumulates in the fruit skin, while 'stella' is a deep red variety with high skin and flesh anthocyanin at maturity. transcript of pavmyb <dig> accumulated in the fruit tissues of both cultivars. however, the level of expression is much higher in the fruit of 'stella' compared with 'rainier' at the latter two stages of fruit development . expression of cherry chs, an early step in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, and cherry ldox, a later step, showed up-regulation correlated with cherry colour .

expression of the strawberry genes, fvmyb <dig> and famyb <dig>  was examined by qpcr analysis during a fruit development series of wild diploid strawberry  and cultivated octaploid strawberry . expression of an r2r <dig> myb repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis, famyb <dig>  <cit>  was also examined in the same fruit series. there was a large increase in the relative transcript levels of the myb <dig> transcription factor in the fruit tissues . in f. ananassa, transcript levels of famyb <dig> were detectable but low until fruit were full size . upon ripening and colour change, there was an almost  <dig> -fold increase in relative transcript level. famyb <dig> showed an expression pattern similar to that published, with the highest transcription level at the ripe fruit stage  <cit>  while fvmyb <dig> expression showed little change. expression levels of fvmyb <dig> in f. vesca also correlate with colour change. f. vesca has an earlier colour change, which occurs only in the skin . for the mature fruit, the increase of famyb <dig> is almost  <dig> times more than that of fvmyb <dig>  this may be due to cultivated strawberry fruit having anthocyanin throughout fruit flesh and skin while the wild strawberry accumulates anthocyanin only in the outer cell layers of the mature fruit.

under stressful conditions , the petals of f. vesca flowers became pigmented . while fvmyb <dig> showed little change in these petals, the transcript of fvmyb <dig> from this tissue showed a large increase in accumulation compared with the petals that were not exposed to high light and were unpigmented. this is further evidence that myb <dig> in strawberry is involved in regulating anthocyanin accumulation.

transformation of myb <dig> into the crop of origin results in elevation of anthocyanin biosynthesis
it has been recently reported that transformation of 'royal gala' apple with 35s:mdmyb <dig> results in plants ectopically accumulating anthocyanins  <cit> . in contrast, when 35s:famyb <dig> was transformed into f. ananassa, , callus and plantlets were not highly pigmented. when these plants were grown under short day conditions  to encourage flowering and then transferred to long days, 35s:famyb <dig> plants had elevated foliar anthocyanins , and red roots . all of the 35s:famyb <dig> transgenic lines had flowers which showed distinctive red stigmas . transgenic fruit from these lines had immature fruits with red seeds, and mature fruits with approximately 50% more anthocyanin. these fruit had the same compound profile as wild-type fruit . transcript analysis of 35s:famyb <dig> lines confirmed an elevation of famyb <dig> transcript level in both the fruit and leaf tissue . no elevation in famyb <dig> transcript level was observed in transgenic tissue versus wild-type.

discussion
the plant myb family
the myb tf superfamily illustrates how a relatively small family in animal genomes  controlling cell division and differentiation has become the most abundant tf group in plants  <cit>  with diverse functions in hormone response  <cit> , growth  <cit> , epidermal cell fate and formation of trichomes  <cit> , stomatal movements and development  <cit> ;  <cit> , seed development  <cit> , response to drought  <cit>  and cold  <cit> , pathogen-response  <cit> , light-sensing responses  <cit> , sugar-related responses  <cit> , modulation of secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates  <cit>  and phenylpropanoids  <cit> . myb proteins have a conserved n-terminal dna binding domain of 100- <dig> residues, depending on the number of r repeats, with each repeat containing a helix-helix-turn-helix structure. within this n-terminal region are key residues important for trans-activation efficiency  <cit> , residues that regulate and specify dna binding  <cit> , and interactions with bhlhs  <cit> . we have identified in this study several residues shared by anthocyanin-promoting mybs, from diverse species, that may be important in their function .

consensus motifs in the c-terminus of mybs, important for function are just beginning to be elucidated. one such example is the case of the c <dig> ear motif repressor clade. atmyb <dig> has the motif nlelrislpddv, which is essential for its repressive activity against the ch <dig> promoter  <cit> . this motif  is also conserved in a number of r2r <dig> myb proteins belonging to subgroup  <dig> which includes atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  and antirrhinum ammyb <dig> and ammyb <dig>  which have very similar effects to atmyb <dig> when over-expressed in tobacco  <cit> . famyb <dig> also has such a motif  <cit> . in anthocyanin-promoting mybs, the motif kprprf was identified  <cit> . by analysing more mybs of this clade we found variation in this c-terminal motif , but enough conservation to suggest it could be used as an identifier.

mybs involved in regulation of phenylpropanoid levels
the phenylpropanoids include flavonoids, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. the accumulation of these compounds in plants and plant organs is central to such quality parameters as colour, human health, bitterness and astringency, as well as plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. r2r <dig> mybs are responsible for controlling different aspects of the phenylpropanoid pathway in a wide range of different plant species. these include flavonol-specific mybs  <cit> , proanthocyanidin-specific mybs  <cit> , inhibitors of branch points  <cit>  and r2r <dig> mybs specifically controlling the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes as well as anthocyanin conjugation, transport into the vacuole  <cit> , and acidification of this compartment to affect fruit/flower/foliage colour  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, one of the r2r <dig> anthocyanin-related clades is made up of atmyb <dig> , atmyb <dig> , and atmyb <dig> . as three of these mybs occur in order on chromosome  <dig>  they may have arisen by tandem duplications of atmyb <dig>  over-expression of pap <dig>  <cit> , atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  <cit>  all result in elevated anthocyanin levels. by examining homologues of pap <dig> in other species, we have identified residues that predict mybs involved in anthocyanin regulation. this anthocyanin-promoting clade is apparently absent in the rice genome and other monocots and gymnosperms, suggesting recent divergence of these mybs.

in apple, three myb genes have been independently isolated, all of which control anthocyanin levels and show a very high degree of sequence similarity; myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myba. it has been suggested that myb <dig> and myba are alleles arising from the different varieties from which they were cloned  <cit> . the myb <dig> sequence is more diverse. it is difficult, from sequence analysis alone, to distinguish between recently duplicated gene paralogues and allelic variation between different varieties. by designing pcr primers to a region of sequence common to both myb <dig> and myb <dig>  we were able to distinguish between the myb <dig> allele from 'red field', which produces a 1000-bp amplification product and other myb <dig> alleles  and the myb <dig> alleles from pacific rose™ and 'royal gala' that produce a 900-bp fragment. if myb <dig> and myb <dig> were paralogues then, in the varieties that only amplified a 900-bp fragment, this fragment would be the product of four alleles . however, if myb <dig> and myb <dig> are allelic, the 900-bp fragment would only be produced by two alleles, one from each of the myb10/myb <dig> alleles of the parents. accordingly, in red-fleshed varieties which are heterozygous for the promoter polymorphism, such as 'robert's crab', one of the myb <dig> alleles produces a 1000-bp fragment, and the other allele a 900-bp fragment. in homozygous malus sieversii 01p <dig> there is only the 1000-bp fragment. in addition to this, if myb <dig> was a paralogue, a further two 900-bp products would be contributed from the myb <dig> alleles. as we do not see dna fluorescence consistent with a 1: <dig> amplification of the 1000- and 900-bp fragments, we propose that myb <dig> and myb1/myba are alleles. the future availability of whole genome sequence for apple will aid a conclusion on the allelic structure of this gene.

identification of anthocyanin-promoting myb <dig> genes in rosaceous crops
using degenerate pcr based on the myb <dig> sequence, we have been able to isolate  <dig> myb10-like genes from a range of rosaceous species. analysis of the genomic dna of these species predicts that all the genes contain two introns in positions consistent with the intron location of other myb genes  <cit> . almost all of the variation in gene size is due to alterations in the predicted length of intron  <dig> . aligning intron  <dig> of malus myb <dig>  and pyrus myb <dig>  revealed a high degree of similarity except within a region of intron  <dig> where there appears to have been a 2500-bp insertion. this does not contain inverted repeats or sequence signatures that are indicative of mobile genetic elements such as transposons or helitrons  <cit> . this insertion could be the result of a local genome rearrangement that took place after the speciation of apple and pear, but before the divergence of apple and crab apples.

botanical classification of the rosaceae has recently been undertaken using  <dig> species analysed for a combination of phenotypic and molecular marker  <cit> . using the nuclear encoded genes, polygalacturonase inhibitor protein  and polyphenol oxidase , a weak or conflicting phylogenic resolution was produced. we have complemented this analysis, on a smaller dataset, by adding additional information relating to a single copy nuclear gene, where orthology has been inferred by both sequence and functional characterisation. the phylogenic placements are in broad agreement with the pyrinae sub-tribe and amygdaloideae tribe described  <cit> .

transient activation of the anthocyanin pathway by rosaceous myb10s requires a bhlh
within the r2r <dig> domain of all  <dig> myb10s there were several key motifs suggesting an association with a bhlh partner. several anthocyanin-promoting mybs have been assayed in heterologous systems; for example, tobacco  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  or antirrhinum petal cells  <cit>  and this trans-activation is often enhanced by the co-infiltration of an appropriate bhlh gene  <cit> . we used transient assay of rosaceous myb genes, with the dfr promoter from arabidopsis and bhlh genes from either apple or arabidopsis. all of the isolated myb tfs were able to trans-activate the dfr promoter in the presence of at least one of the four bhlhs tested. only the apple myb <dig> gene responded equally to either apple or arabidopsis bhlh genes. this may indicate a degree of specificity that exists for the apple bhlh gene and its association with apple myb gene and target promoter. however, the degree of trans-activation, and interaction with bhlh partners, varies greatly amongst the rosaceous mybs genes tested . in particular, plum and apricot showed trans-activation values in excess of five times that of the 35s-promoter. such high trans-activation potential may be due to more effective interaction of plum and cherry mybs with tobacco transcription factors endogenous within the transient assay, or could point to an enhanced ability of these mybs to promote high levels of anthocyanin. further analysis of these myb tfs in homologous systems is required, and techniques such as yeast-2-hybrid used to probe which protein residues are responsible for strong or weak interactions.

myb <dig> expression is strongly associated with anthocyanin production in fruits
during fruit development, in both strawberry and cherry, the transcript level of myb <dig> was up-regulated. a correlation between transcript and anthocyanin production has already been reported in apple  <cit> . in a cherry cultivar which has lower anthocyanin levels at maturity the expression of myb <dig> transcript was lower than in a dark-fruited cultivar. it remains for these genes to be mapped in crops segregating for different pigmentation levels. however, for apple, myb10/myb1/myba is the major gene in a crossed population segregating for red flesh  <cit>  and red skin  <cit> .

transformation of strawberry with famyb <dig> resulted in plants with elevated root, foliar and fruit anthocyanin levels . these levels were not as high as previously reported in 35s:mdmyb <dig> apple transformants  <cit> , due perhaps to other partners in the myb/bhlh/wd <dig> complex. it has been shown recently that tomato fruits, with elevated anthocyanins due to over-expression of myb and bhlh members of the mbw complex, are responsible for promoting human health attributes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the rosaceae family-wide characterisation of mybs provides insight into the evolution of this tf and has implications for the understanding of temporal-spatial colour change. our identification of this set of mybs will aid development of new rosaceous fruit and flowers by allowing the testing of co-segregation of myb alleles with pigment phenotypes in rosaceae, which are both common and highly sought after . if these candidate genes do segregate for anthocyanin levels, gene-based marker-assisted selection or even cisgenics could be used in breeding programmes. this approach has worked for apple  <cit>  and there is preliminary evidence that pavmyb <dig> co-locates with a qtl for fruit and flesh colour in cherry  and pprmyb <dig> co-locates with anther colour segregating in the peach reference map . this group of transcription factors therefore becomes useful as a breeding and biotechnological tool.
