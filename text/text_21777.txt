BACKGROUND
the multilineage potential of mscs was first reported in  <dig> by friedenstein et al.  <cit> . subsequently, numerous studies investigated the potential of mscs to participate in the repair and regeneration of diseased and damaged tissue, including bone  <cit> – <cit> . mscs migrate to sites of tissue damage by recognizing and responding to chemokines critical for cell homing  <cit> – <cit> . indeed mscs were shown to improve the biomechanical properties of regenerated callus in a mouse model  <cit> . yet the intricate mechanisms dictating the activation, trafficking and beneficial properties of mscs are still under investigation.

the isolation and definitive characterization of mscs is complex. the number of mscs found in adult tissue is relatively low and appears to decrease with age, so that cell-based therapies will likely rely on the expansion of msc populations ex vivo  <cit> . in order to isolate and expand such cells to determine their roles in bone or other tissue regeneration, markers and methodology for distinguishing undifferentiated mscs from a heterogeneous cell population must be clearly defined. currently, mscs are characterized by their ability to self-renew and undergo tri-lineage differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes; these cells are further identified as cd105+, cd73+, cd90+ cells that lack cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> or cd11b, cd79alpha or cd <dig> and further lacking hla-dr surface molecules  <cit> , <cit> . however these requirements may not be conserved between species  <cit> .

nestin, an intermediate filament, has been identified as a marker of neural stem cells  <cit> – <cit> . the expression of nestin in these cells is inversely correlated with cellular differentiation and thus it is thought to represent a developmentally regulated marker of immature cell status  <cit> . increases in the number of nestin-immunopositive cells have been reported in areas of the damaged rat brain following cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury  <cit> . however, nestin expression may not be limited to neuronal lineage cells and moreover may represent a common marker for multilineage progenitor cells  <cit> – <cit> . nestin expression has been demonstrated in human, plastic adherent bone marrow derived mscs  <cit> . additionally, cd45-/nestin + cells from bone marrow were able to form colony-forming unit fibroblasts, and were able to undergo tri-lineage differentiation  <cit> .

nestin expression may also be regulated by hypoxia. the bone marrow niche, which contains nestin-positive progenitor cells, is hypoxic  <cit>  and nestin expression increases in cells near areas of ischemic damage in rat brain  <cit> , kidneys  <cit>  and heart  <cit> . in this study we examined the expression of nestin in equine, canine and human bone marrow derived mscs undergoing osteogenic differentiation to determine whether nestin levels were attenuated as the cells acquired a more mature phenotype. we also examined the effects of hypoxia on expression of nestin in human mscs and examined a role for hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha  and vascular endothelial growth factor  in the response. additionally, we quantified the temporal expression of nestin in the fracture callus during bone regeneration, a site that has been characterized as hypoxic  <cit> – <cit> .

RESULTS
nestin expression is maintained during msc differentiation
an increase in alp staining in parallel with positive ar staining was used as a qualitative evaluation of osteogenic differentiation. increased alp and ar staining over time in osteogenic media confirmed that both human and canine mscs differentiated in culture . we have previously confirmed osteogenic differentiation of equine bone marrow-derived mscs under conditions identical to those used here  <cit> . there were no significant changes in nestin expression in mscs induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation, in any species investigated . nestin mrna expression was normalized across time points to day  <dig> expression. our findings suggest that nestin expression is not correlated to osteogenic differentiation state.

hypoxia induced nestin expression in hmscs
there was a significant increase in nestin mrna expression in hmscs at 24 hours post incubation in 1% o <dig> compared to cells incubated at 21% o <dig> . this rise in nestin expression was transient, as it was followed by a significant decrease at 48 hours . nestin protein levels were significantly greater in 1% o <dig> at both  <dig> and 24 hrs . furthermore, treatment of hmscs with desferroxamine, an iron chelator and stabilizer of hif-1α, increased nestin mrna expression at  <dig> and 24 hours, at which time this increase achieved statistical significance . our data suggest that nestin mrna and protein levels are increased under hypoxic conditions via a mechanism requiring the hif-α family of transcription factors.

hmsc nestin expression is inhibited following treatment with vegf receptor antagonist
vegf levels are increased under hypoxia via a mechanism that involves the hif-α family  <cit> , <cit> . vegf in turn has been shown to control the expression of a number of genes including annexin a <dig>  <cit> , <cit> . we observed a significant increase in vegf expression in hmscs cultured in 1% o <dig> for 24 hrs when compared to cells cultured at 21% o <dig> . interestingly, treatment of cells with the vegf receptor antagonist cpo-p <dig> attenuated 1% o2−induced nestin expression at 24 hrs . our data suggest that vegf plays a role in the mechanism by which nestin expression increases under hypoxic conditions.

nestin expression increases over time in the fracture callus
a significant increase in nestin mrna expression was observed in the fracture callus of mice three and seven days post fracture .

discussion
nestin is recognized as a marker of neural progenitor cells, wherein nestin expression is inversely correlated with cellular differentiation and is thus developmentally regulated  <cit> , <cit> . specifically the transition from proliferating neural stem cell to post-mitotic neurons leads to the down-regulation of nestin  <cit> , <cit> . recent studies have indicated that nestin is also expressed in a variety of other cells including cells of mesenchymal phenotype, hair follicle stem cells  <cit>  and newly proliferating endothelial cells  <cit> , and may be a potential general marker of immature cell types  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . specifically cd45−nestin+ cells have been described as mscs, maintaining self-renewal and multilineage mesenchymal differentiation potential  <cit> . however, depending on cell source nestin expression in mesenchymal-like stem cells can be variable  <cit> . in our study nestin was expressed in mscs derived from equine, canine and human bone marrow. nestin mrna expression did not significantly change during osteogenic differentiation. the maintenance of nestin levels throughout the process of osteogenic differentiation suggests that nestin expression is not exclusive to undifferentiated mscs, but is maintained throughout their osteogenic lineage commitment and differentiation. the consistency of this finding between between species suggests that nestin expression is not an effective means of determining the unspecialized status of mscs.

nestin expression levels are increased in tissues with ischemic damage  <cit> – <cit> . increased nestin at sites of ischemia could be due to the migration of nestin positive progenitors to the site, or up-regulation of nestin expression in resident progenitors or more committed cells in response to the hypoxic environment. nestin expression has been shown to be enhanced in astrocytes exposed to hypoxia and down regulated following hyperoxia  <cit> . our data show that there was a significant increase in nestin protein expression in hmscs as early as 6 h after exposure to 1% o <dig> compared to cells incubated at 21% o <dig>  hypoxia is known to upregulate genes via the hypoxia-inducible factor  transcription pathway. under normoxic conditions hif-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase-domain proteins , ubiquitinated by the von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor protein, and undergoes proteosomal degradation. however, under hypoxic conditions the activity of phds is reduced, hif-1α accumulates and forms a heterodimer with hif1-β. the hif- <dig> complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to the hypoxia-responsive element  on target genes to activate transcription  <cit> , <cit> . to determine the role of hif-1α in hypoxia-induced nestin expression we used dfo. dfo chelates iron, an essential co-factor for the function of prolyl-hydroxylase domains , which under normoxic conditions leads to stabilization and accumulation of hif-1α  <cit> , <cit> . in our study, dfo increased nestin mrna expression at 6 hrs that became significantly increased over control at 24 hrs. our data show that nestin levels are increased under hypoxic conditions, via a mechanism requiring the hif- <dig> family of transcription factors.

vascular endothelial growth factor  plays a pivotal role in neovascularization; and stimulates angiogenesis necessary for endochondral ossification  <cit> , <cit> . vegf is induced by hypoxia under the control of hif-1α  <cit> . interestingly, we and others have shown that proteins such as annexin a <dig> are upregulated under hypoxic conditions in a process that requires vegf  <cit> , <cit> . specifically we showed that addition of a vegf inhibiting antibody or cbo-p <dig>  a vegf receptor antagonist, to cells cultured under hypoxia for 24 hours attenuated induction of annexin a <dig>  in this study, as expected, we observed a significant increase in vegf expression in hmscs cultured in 1% o <dig>  and treatment of cells with cbo-p <dig> attenuated hypoxia-induced nestin expression. this suggests that vegf plays a significant role in the mechanism by which nestin expression increases under hypoxic conditions.

areas of bone damage, such as fracture are hypoxic in nature due to disruption of the vasculature find  <cit> – <cit> . mscs are known to home to, and proliferate in areas of tissue injury and play a distinctive role in the healing process including neovascularization and formation of a fracture callus  <cit> , <cit> . thus it is likely that the arrival of nestin expressing mscs, and/or the hypoxic nature of the fracture site might result in increased nestin levels during bone healing. our study demonstrated a significant increase in nestin mrna expression in a callus at days three and seven days post femoral fracture in the mouse. the role of nestin during bone healing is not known. a decrease in nestin expression has been shown as an essential prerequisite for the induction of cdk5-dependant apoptosis in neural progenitor cells  <cit> . nestin was also shown to play a protective role against high glucose induced apoptosis in murine podocytes  <cit> . the central role of nestin may therefore be to protect cells from apoptosis in a hypoxic environment and maintain cellular proliferative status in areas of tissue injury.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, nestin was expressed in undifferentiated mscs of human, canine and equine origin. furthermore, contrary to our hypothesis that nestin is a marker of undifferentiated mscs, nestin expression was maintained throughout their lineage commitment and osteogenic differentiation. our data also show that nestin expression is significantly upregulated by hypoxia and that this increase in nestin is in part regulated by hif-1α and vegf. interestingly nestin levels were significantly upregulated at the fracture site, an environment rendered hypoxic by disruption of blood vessels. further studies are required to understand the role of nestin in bone cell biology and ultimately bone regeneration.
