BACKGROUND
human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  derived gene therapy vectors are being used in the development of gene therapy treatments of many disorders  <cit> , principally due to their ability to transduce dividing and non-dividing cells, resulting in long term stable expression of the desired transgene  <cit> . also, compared to their oncoretroviral counterparts, once pseudotyped they are relatively easy to concentrate to high titres  <cit> . however, fears regarding the safety of hiv- <dig> derived vectors have persisted, especially due to the demonstrated oncogenic potential of other retroviral vectors.

self inactivating  vectors are designed to prevent the transfer of enhancer and promoter elements in the 5' long terminal repeat  of the vector to transduced cells  <cit> . these vectors contain a deletion in the 3' u <dig> sequence which is transferred to the 5' u <dig> sequence during reverse transcription, resulting in a provirus that contains no ltr derived enhancer or promoter elements  <cit> , reducing the probability of proviral mediated gene activation. in sin vectors, an internal heterologous promoter is used to express the transgene. as no full length rna is produced by the integrated vector, the chances of inducing aberrant expression of nearby genes via 3' ltr read-through, and vector mobilisation by other viruses infecting the cell  <cit> , is decreased. sin vectors also exhibit improved transgene expression  <cit> , particle production and transduction efficiency  <cit>  compared to their non-sin counterparts. however, repair of the sin deletion has been shown to occur at a measurable frequency  <cit> , meaning these vectors do not entirely eliminate the possibility of replication competent retrovirus production, vector mobilization or gene activation.

these issues are more than hypothetical. the treatment of x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency  with an oncoretroviral vector has demonstrated that the deregulation of gene, resulting from the integration of a viral genome near the gene in question, can have serious consequences  <cit> . in approximately one quarter of the patients treated, the virus integrated near to an oncogene, most commonly lmo <dig>  leading to deregulation of the oncogenic locus and a t cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. similarly, in the treatment of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease using an oncoretroviral vector, clonal populations have emerged in both patients treated thus far  <cit> . whilst there is a difference in the integration site preference between oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors  <cit> , this does not exclude the possibility of a similar result occurring when hiv- <dig> derived gene therapy vectors are utilised, especially since repair of the sin deletion can occur. this suggests that further development of lentiviral vectors are required to reduce safety concerns associated with the use of these vectors.

in this study, in order to improve the safety of the transfer vector, homology between the transfer vector and hiv- <dig>  and between the vector ltrs, was reduced, resulting in decreased rates of sin repair. in addition, a systematic analysis of the transfer vector sequence was undertaken to minimise the amount of hiv- <dig> sequence within the vector and to remove signals that adversely impact on the processing of the viral genomic rna . this analysis was able to prevent splicing of the grna, replace the 3' polyadenylation signal and reduce the size of the transfer vector.

RESULTS
splice site modifications
splicing is used by hiv- <dig> to produce multiple mrna transcripts encoding various proteins  <cit> . however, in the context of a hiv- <dig> derived gene transfer vector, splicing is unnecessary and can lead to a reduction in the amount of genomic rna  available for packaging. therefore, we chose to mutate the hiv- <dig> splice donor site such that splicing no longer occurs.

we have previously shown that in our vector phiv-1se, that splicing occurs between the hiv- <dig> major splice donor and cryptic splice acceptor sites in the sv <dig> promoter sequence  <cit> . mutation of the major splice donor site from gt to cg  reduced but did not abrogate splicing . dna sequencing indicated that the residual splicing originated at the minor splice donor site  <dig> bases 3' of the major splice donor site. therefore, vectors which contained mutations to both the major and minor splice donor sites were constructed. five different mutations were evaluated, in these both splice donor sites were mutated from gt to  ct ;  ga ;  gg ;  at  or  gc .

qualitative rt-pcr showed that all vectors except phiv-1sdm <dig> se produce less spliced rna compared to phiv-1sdmse . the titres of the vectors phiv-1sdm2se, phiv-1sdm <dig> se and phiv-1sdm <dig> se were equal and approximately 2-fold higher than phiv-1sdmse  whilst phiv-1sdm <dig> se gave a titre equal to phiv-1sdmse . phiv-1sdm2se was chosen for further studies as it offered high titres in combination with very low levels of residual rna splicing.

3'u <dig> modifications
in order to reduce homology between the  <dig> and 3' ltrs the effect of replacing the hiv- <dig> polyadenylation signal with either the sv <dig>  or bgh  polyadenylation signals was investigated. for the bgh vector the polyadenylation signal was inserted after the aflii site in the r sequence so that it replaced the last  <dig> bp of r and all of u <dig>  for the sv <dig> vector the polyadenylation signal was inserted  <dig> bp after the saci site in the r sequence so that it replaced the last  <dig> bp of r and all of u <dig>  in both constructs all of u <dig>  with the exception of the  <dig> bp att sequence was deleted, as was all extraneous sequence between the end of the eyfp coding sequence and the start of the ppt . the resulting constructs were designated phiv1sdm2sesvatt <dig> and phiv1sdm2sebghatt <dig> 

when tested for virus titre using amounts of vector dna for transfection  that were limiting for virus production, there was no significant difference in titre between the vectors . reducing the att sequence to  <dig> bp in length resulted in significantly lower titres . from this analysis the bghatt <dig> and sv40att <dig> constructs appeared equivalent to the phiv-1sdm2se vector, with the apparent advantage that they contain less hiv- <dig> sequence than the latter.

combination gag and 3'u <dig> deletion vectors
deletion mapping demonstrated that bases 325- <dig> of the gag gene sequence present in our original vector could be deleted without significantly affecting virus titre . this deletion  was transferred into phiv-1sdm2sebghatt <dig> and phiv-1sdm2sesvatt <dig>  in both cases, the addition of this deletion increased the resulting virus titre compared to the parental vectors . the vector phiv-1sdmse2sv40att19Δgag was chosen for further analysis as it exhibited the highest titre. for simplicity, this construct was renamed prk <dig> 

5'u <dig> modifications
the hiv- <dig> 5'u <dig> contains a modulatory region between - <dig> and - <dig>  included in which is a negative regulatory element between - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , as well as core enhancer and promoter sequences. deletion mapping  was used to determine if the modulatory and negative regulatory elements are required in the context of a hiv- <dig> derived gene transfer vector. in addition, deletion of the 5'att sequence was assessed as this sequence would appear to be redundant given that the att sequence is duplicated from the 3' ltr upon reverse transcription. the titres of prk1Δatt, prk1Δatt340/ <dig> and prk1340/ <dig> were not significantly different to that of prk <dig>  while all the other deletions lead to a significant decrease in virus titre .

5' polyadenylation signal
retroviral polyadenylation signals are thought to be inherently leaky as they must allow read-through of the 5' ltr so that the genome can be efficiently transcribed  <cit> . while substitution of the hiv- <dig> polyadenylation signal with the sv <dig> polyadenylation signal in the 3' ltr of the vector results in the sv <dig> polyadenylation signal being utilised during virus production, during reverse transcription it is 5'r/u <dig> which acts as a template for the cdna, resulting in the hiv- <dig> polyadenylation signal being used in the resulting provirus. therefore, to change the polyadenylation signal used in transduced cells, the sequence of the polyadenylation signal in the 5' ltr must be replaced. to this end the bgh polyadenylation signal was inserted into the 5'ltr of prk1Δatt340/ <dig>  as the bgh polyadenylation signal contains a downstream sequence element  that increases the accuracy, but not efficiency of polyadenylation, two variants were created, one without , and one with  the bgh polyadenylation signal dse  inserted after the aataaa motif in r, so as to replace the last  <dig> bp of r . in both these constructs a small decrease in virus titre was seen  compared with the parental vector .

we then assessed whether the use of the bgh polyadenylation signal in the provirus resulted in reduced transcriptional read-through compared with the hiv- <dig> signal. to allow this, vectors which had the structure of the 3' ltr post reverse transcription were created for prk <dig> and prk2dse giving the vectors prk2prt and prk2dseprt. the vector phiv-1sdmse was also analysed for read-through. however, as the structure of the 3' ltr pre and post reverse transcription in phiv-1sdmse is unchanged, this vector could be tested without modification. each vector construct was transfected into 293t cells along with constructs expressing tat and rev and the resulting mrna isolated and reverse transcribed. the total amount of vector transcripts, and the amount that is contiguous with sequences 3' of the polyadenylation signal, were then determined to allow the frequency of polyadenylation signal read-through to be measured. this was done using two real time pcr assays; one that detects the eyfp sequence present in the vector, and one that detects sequence spanning from eyfp into the pbcks cloning vector  .

the results of this assay  indicated that the post reverse transcription 3' ltrs from both prk <dig> and prk2dse actually exhibit increased levels of polyadenylation signal read-through compared to phiv-1sdmse. therefore, these vectors were not considered further and the vector prk1Δatt340/ <dig> was chosen for further assessment.

areal time pcr was used to determine the frequency of polyadenylation signal read-through in 293t cells transduced with the vector, pcdna <dig> tat101ml and phcmvrevnlwhvpre. results are mean ± sd.

detailed comparison of prk <dig> and prk1Δatt340/ <dig> with phiv-1sdmse
the prk <dig> and prk1Δatt340/ <dig> vectors were directly compared with the parental plasmid phiv-1sdmse in a number of assays to see if the changes incorporated into prk <dig> and prk1Δatt340/ <dig> resulted in an improved vector. assessment of titre showed that both the modified vectors had a small  but significant  reduction in titre compared with phiv-1sdmse . we note that the titres reported in figure  <dig> are significantly higher than those reported in figure  <dig>  our best explanation for this is that the experiments were done over  <dig> year apart, and used different batches of transfection reagents and cells cultured from different stocks.

the propensity for prk1neo and prk1Δatt340/184neo to repair the sin deletion in the 3'ltr was then assessed using a marker rescue assay. for this analysis vectors carrying the neomycin resistance gene were used in order to be able to detect unitary events. in this assay, cells which have been transduced by each virus are transfected with plasmids encoding proteins necessary for virus production . if the deletion is repaired, the cell will contain full length genomic transcripts which can be packaged, resulting in virus production. however, it is also possible that transcription from a nearby upstream active promoter will result in a packagable message. therefore, to selectively amplify the events where the ltr has been repaired, the virus rescued in the first instance was used to transduce cells and a second round of rescue performed. the vectors phiv-1sdmsneoltr , and phiv-1sdmsneo were utilised as assay controls.

after  <dig> rounds of rescue, phiv-1sdmsneo was rescued 2-fold more efficiently than prk1neo  and  <dig> -fold more efficiently than prk1Δatt340/184neo  , meaning prk1Δatt340/184neo was rescued  <dig> -fold less efficiently than prk1neo . to further examine the differences between these vectors, individual neomycin resistant colonies from the virus assay of the round  <dig> rescued virus were isolated using cloning rings and the genomic dna analysed for the structure of the 5' ltr using pcr. the 5' primer for this pcr was designed to bind to the att sequence in the 5' ltr and the 3' primer to the primer binding site. a fully repaired 5' ltr will give a pcr product of  <dig>  or  <dig>  bases, whilst a non-repaired sin 5' ltr will result in a pcr product of  <dig> , or  <dig>  bases . all colonies examined from phiv-1sdmsneo and phiv-1sdmsneoltr exhibited fully repaired ltrs. in contrast 18%  of the colonies from prk1neo that yielded pcr products, and 32%  of the colonies from prk1Δatt340/184neo that yielded pcr products, were indicative of non-repaired sin ltrs, demonstrating a significant improvement in the maintenance of the sin phenotype in prk1Δatt340/184neo   but not in prk1neo. the corresponding numbers for fully repaired ltrs were 59%  and 17% , respectively, meaning the rate of fully repaired ltrs was significantly reduced in prk1Δatt340/184neo compared to both prk1neo and phiv-1sdmsneo . both prk1neo  and prk1Δatt340/184neo  also gave some pcr products of a size intermediate between the sin ltr and the fully repaired ltr. sequence analysis of intermediate size pcr products from prk1Δatt340/184neo showed partial repair of the u <dig> sequence, with the sequence truncated at the 5' end. of the  <dig> clones of this type that were successfully analysed,  <dig> also contained partial duplications of the r/sv <dig> polyadenylation sequence from the 3' ltr . in addition, while all colonies derived from phiv-1sdmsneo and phiv-1sdmsneoltr yielded pcr products,  <dig> out of  <dig> colonies from prk1neo, and  <dig> of  <dig> colonies from prk1Δatt340/184neo, did not yield a pcr product, suggesting that at least one of the pcr primer sequences was missing.

discussion
while the broad design features for a successful lentiviral vector have been apparent for some time, we believe that refinement of vector design can lead to significant improvements in vector performance. as the issue of the production of replication competent virus appears to have already been solved in third generation lentiviral vector systems, in this study we have focussed on improving our vector in two ways  by improving rna processing by minimising splicing and  reducing the propensity for sin repair and vector mobilisation, while maintaining vector titre, a principle determinate of vector utility.

in our analyses we generally found that intra-experiment variation was much less than the variation between experiments, and that the latter was greatly reduced if the experiment was repeated relatively contemporarily. in all cases, the observed relative differences between vectors were highly reproducible, even if the absolute titres were less so.

splicing has an important role to play in the hiv- <dig> lifecycle. by alternately splicing the  <dig> kb genome, mrna encoding multiple proteins can be produced  <cit> . however, this process is irrelevant in the context of a hiv- <dig> gene transfer vector, and can result in a decrease in the amount of full length grna available for packaging. mutation of the cryptic splice acceptor sites in our vector had previously been attempted but was unable to reduce the amount of splicing as it resulted in other cryptic splice acceptor sites being used . therefore, we chose to mutate both the major and minor hiv- <dig> splice donor sites as cryptic splice donor sites appear to be less common. this is presumably due to the more rigid consensus sequence for splice donor sites  than splice acceptor sites   <cit> .

mutation of the hiv- <dig> major splice donor site has been previously attempted  <cit> . the site was mutated from gt to ca or gg. these modifications were only able to prevent splicing to a limited extent due to the activity of the hiv- <dig> minor splice donor site. in the present study splicing could only be reduced by simultaneously mutating both the major and minor splice sites. however, not all mutations were equally effective. closer examination revealed the mutations which contained a purine as the second base of the mutation lead to a significant increase in virus titre and a reduced amount of splicing. as the splice donor sites are very close to the highly structured packaging signal  <cit> , this requirement for a purine as the second base of the splice donor sites may be due to the effect of the mutation on the secondary structure of the mrna. the residual amount of splicing seen is most likely due to the use of cryptic splice donor sites  <cit> . presumably, the mutation of the major and minor splice donor sites would be effective in reducing splicing to any splice acceptor in the vector, and therefore provides a general method for reducing unwanted vector splicing.

modifications to the 3' ltr were able to reduce the amount of hiv- <dig> sequence within the vector. the hiv- <dig> polyadenylation signal was successfully substituted with the bgh or sv <dig> polyadenylation signal. in addition all of u <dig>  except the att sequence, was successfully deleted. due to conflicting reports regarding the exact size of att  <cit> , both  <dig> and  <dig> bp sequences were assessed. in both vectors, the use of the  <dig> bp att sequence resulted in higher virus titres.

deletion mapping was used to identify a  <dig> bp sequence in gag which was able to be removed from the transfer vector without significantly affecting virus titre. this region can be mapped to a cis repressive sequence  within gag. these crs are responsible for the retention of the unspliced hiv- <dig> mrna in the nucleus prior to production of rev  <cit> . there are many crs sequences within gag,  <dig> of which are within the gag coding sequence in the transfer vector. the deletion described here was able to remove one of these regions. the removal of the others was not possible as their sequences are necessary for efficient virus production. however, mutation of these crs elements is possible and has been shown to lead to rev independent gag expression in hiv- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it may be beneficial to examine these mutations in the context of the transfer vector to determine their effect on grna levels and virus production. however, whether this would result in a rev independent vector is unclear. the crs elements direct the mrna to distinct intranuclear locations  <cit>  allowing the mrna to bind to rev and exit the nucleus along the correct pathway  <cit> . by deleting them, the mrna may not exit the nucleus along the correct pathway, which may have repercussions for the viral assembly process and hence titre.

within the field of lentiviral gene therapy vectors, most groups have chosen to replace the 5' ltr with a constitutive promoter  to allow tat independent transcription  <cit> . this reduces the number of plasmids required for the production of the vector and also reduces the amount of hiv- <dig> sequence within the production system as a whole, and is assumed to reduce the probability of rcl being produced and of sin deletion repair occurring. however, given that none of the third generation vector systems generate measurable rcl, and sin repair is not usually assessed, the degree to which this approach to vector design improves safety is hard to assess. we note that the use of a heterologous promoter to replace u <dig> in the 5' ltr also removes a level of regulation from the vector, and that using the hiv- <dig> 5' ltr requires that an additional recombination step must occur  for the formation of a replication competent lentivirus, or for active transcription of a provirus via a repaired sin deletion  to take place. in our view, this means that the retention of the hiv- <dig> 5' ltr in the vector may be preferable. clearly, these two approaches to vector design need to be directly compared with respect to  the likelihood of generating rcl, and  the rate of sin repair, to resolve which is preferable. given that measurable rcl is not generated by advanced lentiviral vector systems, a surrogate assay, such as quantitative assessment of recombination intermediate that could lead to the generation of rcl may be a more appropriate assay to use.

the 5' ltr contains many regulatory elements, most of which are within u <dig>  <cit> . included in this sequence is the modulatory region which, whilst important for wild type hiv- <dig>  may not be required in the context of a hiv- <dig> derived gene transfer vector. deletion mapping established that the negative regulatory element  within the modulatory region was not required. in addition, the att sequence in the 5' ltr could also be deleted as this sequence is also not required in the context of a hiv- <dig> derived gene transfer vector .

we also successfully showed that a heterologous polyadenylation signal could be incorporated into the 5' ltr, and hence the provirus. the use of the bgh polyadenylation signal, either with or without the downstream sequence element, to replace the hiv- <dig> polyadenylation signal in the 5' ltr was successful in vectors containing an sv <dig> polyadenylation signal in the 3' ltr. however, when tested, it was shown that insertion of the bgh polyadenylation signal resulted in an increase in polyadenylation signal read-through in the provirus. therefore, the use of a heterologous polyadenylation signal in the 5' ltr, while technically possible, does not appear to offer any advantages in polyadenylation efficiency over the hiv- <dig> signal, and so was not used in our final vectors. a similar vector in which the sv <dig> polyadenylation signal was incorporated into the 5' ltr was unsuccessful, with titre being reduced to very low levels . these results may reflect the inherent conflict between the necessity for poly read-through in the 5' ltr and the wish for efficient polyadenylation in the 3' ltr.

detailed comparison of phiv-1sdmsneo, prk1neo and prk1Δatt340/184neo showed that there was a significant difference in the ability of the viral genome to be rescued upon expression of packaging functions. the use of two rounds of rescue in our assay was vital in showing this difference. previous attempts to measure the rate of sin repair have analysed repair after a single round of transduction  <cit> . however, this does not distinguish between repair of the promoter and transcription from cryptic promoters upstream of the ltr  <cit> . the transcripts from cryptic promoters do not contain a repaired ltr, and therefore are unlikely to produce virus capable of undergoing a further round of replication. the power of our 2-stage assay is exemplified by the fact that with phiv-1sdmsneo, 100% of first round colonies examined for ltr status were sin,  while 100% of second round colonies were repaired, demonstrating extremely strong selection for ltr repair in the assay. interestingly, it was only when homology between the u <dig> regions had been completely eliminated that the rate of sin repair was significantly reduced. even when homology was reduced to just  <dig> bases in the u <dig> regions, as in prk1neo, the rate of rescue was only reduced two-fold, which was not significantly different to phiv-1sdmsneo. similarly, while the percentage of complete repair of the sin deletion in secondary isolates was reduced, this was only to 59% of the rate in phiv-1sdmsneo and again was not significantly different from phiv-1sdmsneo. in fact, repair still occurred in the absence of any homology between the u <dig> regions, as in prk1Δatt340/184neo. however, in this instance there was a significant reduction in both the rate of rescue, and the percentage of repaired ltrs compared to phiv-1sdmsneo and to prk1neo, and a significant increase in the percentage of sin ltrs compared to phiv-1sdmsneo. sequence analysis of colonies from the prk1Δatt340/184neo colonies showed that the pcr products of the size predicted for repaired ltrs with a complete u <dig> sequence or retaining the full sin deletion  were indeed of the expected structure. in addition, partially repaired ltr sequences were also seen which contain a u <dig> sequence truncated at the 5' end, several of these ltrs also contained partial repeats of the r and sv <dig> sequences . these characteristics  of prk1Δatt340/184neo should reduce the probability of vector mobilisation and of a replication competent virus being produced. whilst the mechanism of repair is unclear, one possibility is that repair may occur during the reverse transcription process. this in turn would suggest that the use of stable cell lines to produce hiv- <dig> derived vectors may not eliminate the issue of sin repair.

this finding also has important implications for hiv- <dig> vector design. a number of groups have chosen to replace the hiv- <dig> 5'u <dig> sequence with a cmv promoter  <cit> . if similar sin deletion repair  occurred in these vectors, transduced cells would contain a hybrid ltr with strong cmv derived enhancer elements, increasing the potential for both virus rescue/mobilisation and enhancer mediated gene activation  <cit> . by using the hiv- <dig> promoter to drive transcription of the viral genome during production, even if recombination does occur, the provirus should remain transcriptionally silent, reducing the probability of vector mobilisation, although the issue of enhancer mediated gene activation would remain. in our view further investigation is warranted to determine the mechanisms of sin deletion repair in vectors with non-homologous u <dig> sequences, and to determine if such repair occurs in vectors with heterologous 5' ltr  promoters. if sin deletion repair does occur in vectors with heterologous 5' ltr  promoters then the suitability of these vectors for clinical application may need to be re-evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
our careful systematic analysis of the vector sequence has improved rna processing and more importantly has allowed a reduction in the amount of hiv- <dig> sequence within the vector resulting in significant improvements in the rate of repair of the sin deletion.
