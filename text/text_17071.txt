BACKGROUND
β-n-acetylglucosaminidases  are glycoside hydrolases  that cut the o-glycosidic bonds formed by n-acetylglucosamine  residues from the non-reducing terminals of oligosaccharides, such as chitooligosaccharides and muropeptides  <cit> . chitooligosaccharides can be produced from the degradation of chitin by hydrochloric acid  <cit>  or chitinases   <cit> . chitin is second only to lignocellulose in natural abundance, but more than  <dig>  tons of chitin from marine sources per year is unutilized chitinous waste  <cit> . glcnacases hydrolyse chitooligosaccharides to produce glcnac, which can be further used for the production of bioethanol  <cit>  and single cell protein  <cit> , the treatment of ulcerative colitis and other gastrointestinal inflammation disorders  <cit>  and pharmaceutical therapy for osteoarthritis  <cit>  and tumours  <cit> . muropeptides can be derived from the peptidoglycan of the cell wall  <cit>  and flagella  <cit> . the hydrolysis of muropeptides by glcnacases indicates that the enzymes function in cell wall recycling  <cit>  and flagellum assembly of bacteria  <cit> . furthermore, glcnacases also exhibit many additional important biological functions and wide range of industrial applications, such as catabolism of ganglioside storage in tay-sachs disease  <cit> , induction of chitinolytic enzymes  <cit>  and synthesis of biologically important oligosaccharides  <cit> .

according to a homology comparison of amino acid sequences, glcnacases have been classified into gh  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . with the rapid development of genome sequencing technology, many glcnacases have been identified in the genomes of animal tissues, insects, plants, bacteria and fungi in recent years. gh  <dig> glcnacases are mainly found in microorganisms, especially bacteria . however, the molecular and biochemical characteristics of the majority of these gh  <dig> glcnacases have not been reported .

yunnan province is known as “the kingdom of nonferrous metals”, “the kingdom of plants” and “the kingdom of animals” in china. in these natural habitats containing metal ions in high concentrations or special products from plants or animals, novel microorganisms and their enzymes may have to evolve, indicating biotechnological potential. heijing is called the “town of salt” in yunnan and has produced salts since ancient china. we previously sampled saline soil from an old mine in the town and reported novel enzymes from bacteria isolated from the soil . one example is the gh  <dig> invertase invhj <dig>  showing novel low-temperature and alkaline activity and sucrose tolerance  <cit> ; another is the gh  <dig> α-galactosidase agaahj <dig>  showing novel salt − protease tolerance and transglycosylation activity, from a potential novel species of pontibacter  <cit> .

in this study, a novel gh  <dig> glcnacase, called hj5nag, was mined from the genome of microbacterium sp. hj5—a new isolate from the saline soil. the purified recombinant hj5nag , which was expressed in e. coli, showed better tolerance to salts and glcnac and higher activity than most glcnacases reported in the literature, including the gh  <dig> glcnacase we previously reported  <cit> . potential molecular adaptations for salt tolerance and the high activity of the enzyme were presumed.

methods
strains, vectors and reagents
strain hj <dig> was isolated from the saline soil of an old salt mine located in heijing town. the details of the strain isolation and identification were described in our previous study  <cit> . the pure culture was deposited in the strains collection of the yunnan institute of microbiology under registration no. ymf  <dig> . e. coli bl <dig>  was purchased from transgen  and was used for gene expression.

the following vectors and reagents were used: plasmid isolation and genomic dna kits ; dntps and dna polymerases ; isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside ; ni2+-nta agarose ; qubit protein assay kit ; peasy-e <dig> vector ; n,n'-diacetyl chitobiose , n,n',n'',n'''-tetraacetyl chitotetraose , p-nitrophenyl β-n-acetylgalactosaminide , and p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside  ; peptidoglycan from bacillus subtilis ; p-nitrophenol , p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside , p-nitrophenyl α-d-galactopyranoside , p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside , p-nitrophenyl β-n-acetylglucosaminide , mutanolysin from streptomyces globisporus atcc  <dig>  chitin and chitosan ; and silica gel g plates . all other chemicals were of analytical grade.

gene cloning and sequence analysis
the glcnacase-encoding gene, designated hj5nag, was obtained by genome sequencing performed on a miseq sequencer  in our lab. the hj <dig> genome sequencing details were described in our previous study  <cit> .

open reading frames from the draft genome of hj <dig> were predicted using the tools described in our previous study  <cit> . blastn and blastp  online tools were used to search homologous sequences and to calculate the identity values. signalp  and interpro  online tools were used to predict the signal peptide and protein domain, respectively. vector nti  <dig>   software was used to calculate frequencies of the amino acid residues. multiple sequences and structures alignments were generated by espript  <cit> .

structure analysis
the homology model of hj5nag was predicted using the swissmodel platform . the proportions of secondary structures were analysed by vadar  <cit> . the charge distributions on the surfaces of various glcnacases were calculated using discovery studio  <dig>  software .

heterologous expression of hj5nag
the coding sequence of hj5nag was amplified by pcr using the primer set rhj5nagef  and rhj5nager . the resulting pcr product was ligated to peasy-e <dig> vector, which has a single 3′-t overhang at the insertion site according to the manufacturer. e. coli bl <dig>  competent cells were transformed with the plasmid for recombinant enzyme expression. a positive transformant harbouring the recombinant plasmid was confirmed by dna sequencing performed by tsingke . a seed culture of the positive transformant was grown overnight at 37 °c and then inoculated in 1: <dig> dilutions into fresh luria–bertani medium with the addition of 100 μg ml− <dig> ampicillin. upon reaching an od <dig> nm of approximately  <dig> , iptg at a final concentration of  <dig>  mm was added to the culture to induce enzyme expression at 20 °c for approximately 20 h.

purification and identification of recombinant glcnacase
cultures containing positive transformant cells were centrifuged and resuspended in ice-cold buffer a containing 20 mm tris–hcl,  <dig>  m nacl, and 10%  glycerol . the cells were disrupted by ultrasonication on ice with  <dig> short bursts of 4 s each at a power output of 150 w. after removing cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto ni2+-nta agarose gel columns to bond the recombinant enzyme. the target recombinant enzyme was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient of 20–500 mm in buffer a. the protein concentration was determined using a qubit protein assay kit using a qubit  <dig>  fluorometer .

sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  was performed to analyse the expression of the recombinant enzyme and the purity of the eluted fractions. the molecular masses of internal peptides from the single band present in the sds–page gel were analysed via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  and were compared with the molecular masses of the internal peptides from rhj5nag.

enzyme assay and substrate specificity
an enzyme assay of purified rhj5nag towards various substrates was performed spectrophotometrically using the pnp and  <dig> -dinitrosalicylic acid  methods, as described in our previous study  <cit> . the pnp method was applied to determine the activity of rhj5nag towards substrates pnpxyl, pnpgal, pnpglc, pnpara, pnpglcnac and pnpgalnac. the dns method was used for the substrates glcnac <dig>  glcnac <dig>  colloidal chitin, chitosan, peptidoglycan and muropeptides .

biochemical characterization
the pnp method using pnpglcnac as substrate was applied to determine the biochemical characteristics of purified rhj5nag, unless otherwise noted. mcilvaine buffer was used for ph  <dig> – <dig> , and  <dig>  m glycine–naoh was used for ph  <dig> – <dig> .

the ph-dependent activity of rhj5nag was determined at 37 °c, with ph values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the ph-dependent stability of rhj5nag was determined by measuring the residual enzyme activity after incubating the enzyme at ph  <dig> – <dig>  for 1 h.

the temperature-dependent activity of rhj5nag was examined at ph  <dig>  and temperatures from  <dig> to 60 °c. the thermostability of rhj5nag was determined by measuring the residual activity of the enzyme after pre-incubation at  <dig>   <dig> and 50 °c and ph  <dig>  for 1–60 min.

to determine the effects of various metal ions and chemical reagents on purified rhj5nag, the enzyme activities were measured after the addition of different metal ions and chemical reagents to the reaction mixture. the metal ions and chemical reagents included  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm  kcl, agno <dig>  cacl <dig>  cocl <dig>  hgcl <dig>  pb <dig>  mgso <dig>  niso <dig>  cuso <dig>  mnso <dig>  znso <dig>  fecl <dig>  edta, β-mercaptoethanol and sds, and  <dig>  or  <dig> %  tween  <dig> and triton x- <dig>  the absorption was measured after removing the precipitate by centrifugation when agno <dig>  hgcl <dig> or sds was added to the reaction mixture. furthermore, the enzyme activity in  <dig> – <dig> %  nacl was also examined, and the enzyme stability in nacl was determined by measuring the residual enzyme activity after pre-incubating the enzyme in  <dig> – <dig> %  nacl for 1 h.

cat values of purified rhj5nag were analysed using  <dig> – <dig>  mm pnpglcnac as substrate at 45 °c and ph  <dig> . a nonlinear regression michaelis − menten fit was applied to analyse the data using graphpad prism . the extent of glcnac inhibition on rhj5nag activity was determined adding  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm glcnac to the reaction solution. then, the β-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity was determined according to the aforementioned kinetic assay. the inhibition constant  was calculated using graphpad prism using the nonlinear mixed-model inhibition equation described detailedly in a previous paper  <cit> .

hydrolytic property of purified rhj5nag
the hydrolysis mixture included 160 μl of  <dig> %  glcnac <dig> or glcnac <dig> and approximately  <dig>  units of purified rhj5nag. after incubating the mixture in mcilvaine buffer  at 37 °c for 6 h, the hydrolysis products were analysed by thin-layer chromatography , as previously described  <cit> .

synergistic action
commercial chitinase from streptomyces griseus, designated ctnsg, was purchased from yuanye bio-technology . the reaction mixture contained colloidal chitin  and either ctnsg , rhj5nag  or both enzymes and was incubated for 120 min. in the time-course study, the reaction mixture containing  <dig> %  colloidal chitin and ctnsg alone was incubated for  <dig>   <dig> or 90 min, rhj5nag was then added to the reaction and incubated for  <dig>   <dig> or 30 min, respectively. according to the manufacturer’s instructions for ctnsg and the biochemical characteristics of rhj5nag, degradation of colloidal chitin was performed at 25 °c and ph  <dig>  . the dns method was used to measure the amount of reducing sugars released from the colloidal chitin. a reaction containing heat-inactivated enzyme  was used as a control. the degree of synergy was calculated using the following equations: ds=rsrhj5nagctnsgrsrhj5nag+rsctnsg where ds is the degree of synergy, rs
rhj5nagctnsg is the amount of reducing sugars released from simultaneous or sequential enzyme reactions, and rs
rhj5nag and rs
ctnsg are the amounts of reducing sugars released from individual enzyme reactions.

accession numbers
the accession numbers of hj5nag and microbacterium sp. hj <dig> 16s rdna in genbank are kx <dig> and kx <dig>  respectively.

RESULTS
strain identification
based on the results of a blastn search, the nucleotide identity was  <dig> % between the partial 16s rdna sequence from hj <dig>  and the 16s rdna sequences from microbacterium flavescens , microbacterium takaoensis  and microbacterium trichothecenolyticum . phylogenetic analysis also placed hj <dig> in the microbacterium cluster but not in the clusters grouped by the species of other genera of microbacteriaceae . therefore, hj <dig> belonged to the genus microbacterium.

gene cloning and sequence analysis
sequence data of approximately  <dig>  mbp was generated by genome sequencing for hj <dig>  and these data yielded a draft genomic dna sequence of approximately  <dig>  mbp after sequence assembly. the analysis of the draft genome predicted an open reading frame designated gene hj5nag. hj5nag has a length of 1608 bp and encodes the 535-residue glcnacase hj5nag, with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda.

the alanine  and glycine  frequencies of the glcnacase were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, both of which are the highest values among the glcnacases shown in table  <dig>  the frequency of acidic aspartic acid  and glutamic acid  of the glcnacase was  <dig> %, which was the third highest . however, frequencies of cysteine  and lysine  in the glcnacase were only  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, both of which were the second lowest . therefore, the ratio of the total frequency of d, e, a and g to the total frequency of c and k of hj5nag  was the highest among the glcnacases shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> amino acid residue frequencies of the experimentally characterized gh  <dig> glcnacases




the predicted signal peptide of hj5nag is cleaved between a <dig> and a <dig> to yield a mature polypeptide consisting of the typical n-terminal domain of bacterial glcnacases  and the catalytic domain of gh  <dig> glcnacases . a blastp search for hj5nag showed that the enzyme was most similar to multiple putative gh  <dig> glcnacases annotated based on genome analysis. among these putative gh  <dig> members, the enzyme from microbacterium sp. root <dig>  shared the highest identity of  <dig> % with hj5nag. based on the alignment of hj5nag with other experimentally characterized glcnacases  , residue d <dig> probably functioned as the catalytic nucleophile/base, and e <dig> probably functioned as the catalytic proton donor/acceptor. in addition, residues d <dig>  r <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> might play an important role in binding the glcnacase ligand  .fig.  <dig> partial amino acid sequences and structures alignments of hj5nag with gh  <dig> glcnacases. sequence names are shown with pdb ids  as follows: 1qba , the glcnacase from s. marcescens  <cit> ; 2gjx , the glcnacase from h. sapiens  <cit> ; and 3gh <dig> , the glcnacase from paenibacillus sp.  <cit> . asterisks and number signs show the putative catalytic residues and ligand-binding residues, respectively. dotted purple line shows the n-terminal domain of bacterial glcnacases . solid purple line shows the catalytic domain of gh  <dig> glcnacases 




structure analysis
the model of hj5nag showed a gmqe score of  <dig>  and a sequence identity of  <dig> % when the template was the crystal structure of the gh  <dig> glcnacase from streptomyces plicatus . the homology model of hj5nag and the crystal structures of  <dig> glcnacases were used to calculate the proportions of secondary structures and the charge distributions on the surfaces. among these glcnacases, the proportions of amino acids used to build the α-helix and β-sheet structures of hj5nag were the second lowest, while the proportion of amino acids used to build random coil structures and the ratio of random coils to α-helices of hj5nag were both the highest . as shown in fig.  <dig>  almost the whole surface of hj5nag was negatively charged. compared with other glcnacases, hj5nag had a much larger negatively charged surface .table  <dig> proportions of secondary structures of gh  <dig> glcnacases

expression, purification and identification of rhj5nag
as shown by an sds–page gel , the recombinant glcnacase was successfully expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  and purified by ni2+-nta affinity chromatography. the maldi–tof ms spectrum of the purified band further confirmed that the purified product was rhj5nag .

biochemical characterization
at ph  <dig>  and 45 °c, purified rhj5nag showed specific activities of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards substrates of pnpglcnac, pnpgalnac, glcnac <dig> and glcnac <dig>  respectively. however, no rhj5nag activity was detected towards substrates of pnpxyl, pnpara, pnpglc, pnpgal, peptidoglycan, muropeptides, colloidal chitin or chitosan. thus, rhj5nag is a glcnacase that can hydrolyse chitooligosaccharides but cannot participate in cell wall turnover or recycling of bacteria.table  <dig> activities of the experimentally characterized glcnacases

discussion
microorganisms isolated from extremophilic locations are of great interest and have attracted substantial attention. microbacterium strains have been found in various extremophilic locations, including antarctic habitats  <cit> , the atacama desert  <cit> , sediment of the indian ocean  <cit> , uranium-rich soil  <cit>  and salty soil  <cit> . to be active in these extremophilic locations, enzymes from local microbacterium strains may have to evolve. to the best of our knowledge, although some pioneering studies have revealed the important functions of some enzymes from microbacterium strains in recent years , few of these enzymes were found to have adapted to extremophilic locations  <cit> . furthermore, we found that all the glcnacases from microbacterium strains were annotated based on in silico analysis without biochemical characterization. therefore, the study may be the first to report an experimentally characterized glcnacase from microbacterium.

drastic inhibition by ag+ and hg2+ appears to be the common property of glcnacases, including hj5nag, the gh  <dig> glcnacases from paenibacillus  <cit>  and v. furnissii  <cit> , the gh  <dig> glcnacases from r. miehei  <cit>  and sphingobacterium sp.  <cit> , the gh  <dig> glcnacase from c. paraputrificum  <cit>  and the glcnacase from s. cerradoensis  <cit> . ag+ and hg2+ have irreversible effects on sulfhydryl groups, and hg2+ can also oxidize indole rings. therefore, cysteine or tryptophan residues may be involved in the catalytic activity of gh  <dig> glcnacases. sequence analysis revealed that w <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> of hj5nag might affect ligand binding. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the conserved w <dig> may also be essential for the activity of hj5nag. sds is an inhibitor of glcnacases, in addition to ag+ and hg2+. all the glcnacases from microbacterium sp. in this study, as well as r. miehei  <cit> , sphingobacterium sp.  <cit>  and l. casei  <cit> , are strongly inhibited by sds. purified rhj5nag showed peak activity at ph  <dig>  and 45 °c. these properties are the same or similar to those of many glcnacases. for example, the gh  <dig> glcnacase from s. thermoviolaceus presents maximum activity at ph  <dig>  and 50 °c  <cit> , the gh  <dig> glcnacase from h. latex presents maximum activity at ph  <dig>  and 45–50 °c  <cit> , the gh  <dig> glcnacase from r. miehei presents maximum activity at ph  <dig>  and 50 °c  <cit> , and the gh  <dig> glcnacase from clostridium paraputrificum presents maximum activity at ph  <dig>  and 50 °c  <cit> . furthermore, the molecular mass of hj5nag  is similar to that of some glcnacases, such as the gh  <dig> glcnacases from a soil-derived uncultured organism   <cit> , c. fimi   <cit> , paenibacillus sp.   <cit>  and s. thermoviolaceus   <cit> , and the gh  <dig> glcnacase from s. thermophilum   <cit> .

purified rhj5nag exhibited good salt tolerance, as the addition of most salts had little to no effect on the enzyme activity, especially cuso <dig> and nacl. most glcnacases reported to date are strongly inhibited by cu2+, such as the gh  <dig> glcnacases from paenibacillus  <cit> , a. caviae  <cit>  and l. casei  <cit> , the gh  <dig> glcnacase from r. miehei  <cit> , the gh  <dig> glcnacase from c. paraputrificum  <cit>  and the glcnacase from s. cerradoensis  <cit> . furthermore, the gh  <dig> glcnacases from paenibacillus are strongly inhibited by ni2+  <cit> ; the gh <dig> glcnacase from a. caviae is strongly inhibited by mn2+  <cit> ; the gh <dig> glcnacase from t. reesei is inhibited by fe3+  <cit> ; the gh  <dig> glcnacase from c. paraputrificum is inhibited by ni2+, co2+, mn2+, zn2+ and fe3+  <cit> ; and the gh  <dig> glcnacase from r. miehei is inhibited by ni2+, co2+, zn2+ and edta  <cit> . salt tolerance has attracted considerable attention because various salts are present or used in industries , such as various marine materials and foods in china, with nacl contents of  <dig> – <dig> %   <cit> . in addition, material processing and fermentation with a high concentration of nacl is helpful to reduce the overall cost because sterilization is unnecessary  <cit> .

to reveal the potential catalytic adaptations of rhj5nag to high concentrations of salt, sequence and structure comparisons to its homologs were performed. . similar to the results from other salt-tolerant enzymes , statistical analysis of the amino acid residues showed that hj5nag presented higher proportions of acidic d and e along with a and g but lower proportions of c and k than its homologs . carboxyl groups from acidic amino acid residues can bind more water molecules and cations than other groups from other amino acid residues, especially k, and thus enable the protein to form a particle stabilized by cooperative hydrated ion networks  <cit> . hydrophobicity must be finely balanced to maintain a protein’s flexibility and stability  <cit> . high nacl concentrations strengthen hydrophobic interactions, which can affect protein folding  <cit> . salt-tolerant proteins are thought to reduce the size of hydrophobic residues to compensate for the increased hydrophobic effect caused by the high salt concentration  <cit> . the high proportion of a and g, which are small hydrophobic residues  <cit> , is compatible with that function. in addition, a low abundance of c might give a protein more flexibility in high salt environments due to the decrease in rigid disulphide bridges  <cit> . . at the level of the secondary structure, a higher percentage of random coil structures at the expense of α-helices is observed for salt-tolerant proteins  <cit> , including hj5nag . greater protein rigidity is usually accompanied by a higher percentage of α-helix structures, while the opposite is observed for a higher percentage of random coils. . at the level of the tertiary structure, an excess of negatively charged surfaces is a typical property of salt-tolerant proteins . the increase in negative charge on the surface can counteract the lower dielectric constant at high salinity and improve the ability of enzymes to bind water and salt ions, thus improving protein solubility .

most characterized glcnacases, including gh  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, show specific activities or v
max of lower than 1000 μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards pnpglcnac, as summarized in table  <dig>  in this study, rhj5nag exhibited a specificity activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> and a v
max of 3097 ± 124 μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards pnpglcnac. furthermore, rhj5nag showed a specificity activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards glcnac <dig>  which is much higher than the values from other glcnacases recorded in the literature, such as the values from sphingobacterium sp.   <cit> , t. spiralis   <cit> , r. miehei   <cit> , v. alginolyticus   <cit>  and s. thermophilum   <cit> . as discussed above, the structure of hj5nag may be more flexible because it has higher proportions of a, g and random coil structures but lower proportions of c and α-helix structures than its homologs. furthermore, hj5nag has a higher proportion of d and e, which are not only negatively charged but also flexible residues. high b-factor values, which are believed to provide high structural flexibility, are usually observed for d and e. the high flexibility is presumed to be a factor in the high activity of the gh  <dig> glcnacase rhj5nag.

although the synergistic action of chitinases and glcnacases for complete enzymatic degradation of chitin is attractive, there are few reports  <cit> . this study may be the first to report a synergistic effect between a chitinase and a gh  <dig> glcnacase. significant synergy was observed between the commercial ctnsg and rhj5nag for chitin degradation, indicating that rhj5nag has great potential in the bioconversion of chitin waste. the tolerance of rhj5nag to glcnac may be one contributor to the significant synergy because glcnac can inhibit glcnacases and result in the accumulation of chitooligosaccharides, which can inhibit chitinases  <cit> . the glcnacases from v. furnissii, trichoderma harzianum, a. oryzae, s. frugiperda, r. miehei and t. spiralis were competitively or noncompetitively inhibited by glcnac, with k
i values of  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>  mm  <cit> , respectively. in this study, rhj5nag showed relatively high glcnac tolerance, with a k
i of  <dig>  mm.

CONCLUSIONS
a gh  <dig> glcnacase was isolated from microbacterium sp. hj <dig> harboured in the saline soil of an abandoned salt mine. biochemical characterization revealed that the glcnacase had novel salt–glcnac tolerance and high activity. these characteristics suggest that the enzyme has versatile potential in biotechnological applications, such as bioconversion of chitin waste and processing of marine materials and saline foods. molecular characterization provides an understanding of the molecular–function relationships for the salt tolerance and the high activity of the gh  <dig> glcnacase.
