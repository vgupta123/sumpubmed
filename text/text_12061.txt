BACKGROUND
multipartite genomes are common among members of the α-proteobacteria  <cit> . most symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria belonging to the genera rhizobium, sinorhizobium, mesorhizobium and bradyrhizobium possess multipartite genomes organized as a single circular chromosome and a variable number of large plasmids  <cit> . in some species plasmids can represent, in terms of size, up to 40% of the total genome. in rhizobium and sinorhizobium species one plasmid  concentrates most of the genes required for nodulation and nitrogen fixation  <cit> . the complete genome sequences of different rhizobia have revealed that plasmids harbor mainly accessory genes and that most encode predicted transport systems and a variety of catabolic pathways that may contribute to the adaptation of rhizobia to the heterogeneous soil and nodule environments  <cit> . these genes are absent from closely related genomes, lack synteny and their g+c composition differs from that of the core genes. the core genes are mainly located on chromosomes, have essential functions in cell maintenance and have orthologs in related species  <cit> . in spite of this evidently biased distribution of core genes in the chromosome and accessory genes in plasmids, it is important to highlight the fact that there are interesting exceptions to this genomic rule: several typical core genes have been found encoded on rhizobia plasmids. some are copies of genes located on chromosomes, with redundant functions that are totally dispensable for normal growth. examples of these genes are the multiple copies of chaperonin-encoding genes groel/groes  <cit> , two tpia genes encoding putative triose phosphate isomerase, a key enzyme of central carbon metabolism  <cit> , and two putative s. meliloti asparagine synthetases , which may have a role in asparagine synthesis from aspartate by atp-dependent amidation  <cit> . in contrast to these reiterated genes, a few single copy core genes have also been localized in plasmids. the trna specific for the second most frequently used arginine codon, ccg, is located on psymb in s. melioti  <cit> . since this gene lies within a region of psymb that could not be deleted  <cit> , it is assumed to be essential for cell viability. the single copy of the mincde genes, conceivably involved in proper cell division, have also been found in plasmids of s. meliloti, r. leguminosarum and r. etli  <cit> . studies in s. meliloti have demonstrated that even though these genes are expressed in free-living cells and within nodules they are nonessential for cell division, since their deletion did not produce the small chromosomeless minicells observed in e. coli and bacillu subtilis  <cit> .

a recent bioinformatic study revealed that approximately ten percent of the  <dig> complete bacterial genomes available in  <dig> carry some core genes on extrachromosomal replicons  <cit> . however, very few of these genes have been functionally characterized and so their real contribution to bacterial metabolism is still an open question.

the complete genome sequence of r. etli cfn <dig> predicts that two putative "housekeeping" genes, panc and panb, which may be involved in pantothenate biosynthesis, are clustered together on plasmid p42f. pantothenate is an essential precursor of coenzyme a , a key molecule in many metabolic reactions including the synthesis of phospholipids, synthesis and degradation of fatty acids, and the operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle  <cit> . the r. etli panc gene is predicted to encode the sole pantoate-β-alanine ligase , also known as pantothenate synthetase  , present in the r. etli genome. the function of this enzyme is the atp-dependent condensation of d-pantoate with β-alanine to form pantothenate, the last step of the pantothenate biosynthesis pathway. the panb gene encodes the putative 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase  , also known as ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase , the first enzyme of the pathway, responsible for the formation of α-ketopantoate by the transfer of a methyl group from  <dig> -methylentetrahydrofolate to alpha-ketoisovalerate. the complete genome sequence of r. etli cfn <dig> predicts that a second putative mohmt enzyme , similar to the product of panb, is encoded on plasmid p42e.

in this work we describe the isolation and use of panc and panb mutants to analyze the involvement of these plasmid-encoded genes in pantothenate biosynthesis. a survey of the localization of pancb genes among members of the rhizobiales with multipartite genomes allowed us to infer a pancb phylogeny and to establish the probable chromosomal origin of these plasmid-borne genes. we also report that the pancb genes could not totally restore the growth in minimal medium  of a strain cured of plasmid p42f, suggesting that other functions essential for growth in mm are encoded in this plasmid.

RESULTS
functional characterization of plasmid p42f encoded pancb genes
the predicted function of the product of panc  annotated as pbal, is the catalysis of the last step of pantothenate synthesis. this pbal  showed 43% identity and 62% similarity over  <dig> amino acids with the functionally characterized pbal of e. coli k <dig> . a search for conserved domains  at ncbi-cdd revealed the presence of a typical pantoate-binding site. the panb gene  is located immediately downstream of panc. the four nucleotide overlap between the panc tga codon and panb atg codon suggest that these genes might be transcribed as an operon. the panb gene encodes a putative mohmt, the first enzyme of the pantothenate pathway. a blastp comparison between the functionally characterized mohmt of e. coli k <dig>  and the putative mohmt encoded on plasmid p42f of r. etli cfn <dig>  showed 37% identity and 56% similarity over a length of  <dig> amino acids. a cd-search indicated that in the putative mohmt of r. etli cfn <dig> the magnesium binding and active site domains are conserved. additionally, paralog search  and pathway tools predicted a second probable mohmt, encoded on plasmid p42e . both proteins are similar in length . however, a blastp comparison of these sequences showed only 36% identity and 56% similarity over a tract of  <dig> amino acids. a cd-search revealed that only  <dig> of  <dig> of the invariable residues present in the active site domain are conserved in rhe_pe <dig>  the metal binding domain could not be detected by the cd-search. to determine whether the panc and panb genes located on plasmid p42f are required for pantothenate synthesis, mutations in these genes were generated by site-directed vector integration mutagenesis via a single cross-over recombination . mutants retv <dig>  and retv <dig>  were unable to grow in minimal medium  lacking calcium pantothenate . supplementation of mm with  <dig> μm calcium pantothenate allowed the panc and panb mutants to recover their wild-type growth rate . the pantothenate auxotrophy displayed by the panb mutant retv <dig> allowed us to discard a functional role of the putative mohmt encoded by rhe_pe <dig> in pantothenate biosynthesis. moreover, a pbbrmcs <dig> clone constitutively expressing rhe_pe <dig>  was unable to complement the pantothenate auxotrophy of the panb mutant .

plasmid ptv <dig>  harboring the panc and panb genes, as well as plasmids ptv <dig> and ptv <dig>  carrying only panc or panb respectively, were introduced into mutant strains retv <dig> and retv <dig> and the growth phenotype of each construction was evaluated in mm. the panc mutant retv <dig> complemented with the pancb genes  recovered wild type growth in mm. in contrast, when complemented only with panc  no growth occurred in the absence of pantothenate. these results strongly suggest that the pancb genes form a single transcriptional unit. as expected, wild type growth of panb mutant retv <dig> was recovered by complementation with the pancb genes or with the panb gene .

the occurrence of pancb genes in plasmids is highly conserved among r. etli and r. leguminosarum strains but not in other members of the rhizobiales with multipartite genomes
to investigate whether the presence of the pancb genes in plasmids is a common characteristic of the rhizobiales, we examined the location of pancb genes in  <dig> members of the rhizobiales having fully sequenced multipartite genomes . to date, the genomes of seven r. etli strains, in addition to cfn <dig>  have been totally sequenced  <cit> . however, with the exception of strain ciat  <dig>  the genomes were released as draft assemblies, precluding pancb localization. we experimentally determined the localization of pancb genes in the genome of four of these r. etli strains  by hybridization of their plasmid profiles with dctp-labelled panc and panb genes from cfn <dig> under high stringency conditions. both probes produced intense hybridization signals on the same plasmid of each strain, indicating that the pancb genes are also plasmid-borne in these r. etli strains . coincidentally, in the three r. leguminosarum strains with fully sequenced genomes reported in the ncbi database, the pancb genes are assigned to plasmids. in contrast, in other species of rhizobiales with multipartite genomes, the pancb genes are always confined to the chromosome, or to chromosome i in those species harboring two chromosomes, with exception of agrobacterium tumefaciens c <dig> which carries pancb on the linear chromosome ii and methylobacterium nodulans ors <dig> that carries panc on their single chromosome and panb on plasmid pmnod <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis of rhizobial pancb genes indicates a common origin of chromosomal and plasmid-borne sequences
two possible hypotheses were considered to explain the presence of pancb genes in plasmids of r. etli and r. leguminosarum strains:  an intragenomic rearrangement of pancb genes from chromosome to plasmid, which must have occurred in the last common ancestor of both species;  by xenologous gene displacement, that is, a horizontal transfer event in which a gene is displaced by a horizontally transferred ortholog acquired from another lineage  <cit> . in the latter hypothesis we assume that the presence of these xenolog genes in plasmids conferred a selective advantage that may have eventually led to the loss of the chromosome-located pancb genes. to test these hypotheses the phylogeny of  <dig> rhizobial species inferred from ten orthologous single copy housekeeping genes  located on primary chromosomes, was compared with the phylogeny of the same rhizobial species inferred from the pancb genes located on plasmids and chromosomes. the rationale for this comparison was that if the plasmid-borne pancb phylogeny agrees with the current phylogeny of the rhizobiales, inferred from the housekeeping genes, it would support the hypothesis of intragenomic transfer of the pancb genes. on the other hand, if both phylogenies are incongruent, it would favor the hypothesis of horizontal transfer of the pancb genes. concatenated nucleic acids multiple alignments were used to infer both phylogenies with the maximum likelihood method described in materials and methods. the resulting phylogenetic trees are shown in figure  <dig>  the housekeeping genes inferred tree  was consistent with the recently reported phylogeny of  <dig> rhizobiales performed on a data set of  <dig> homologous proteins from the primary chromosome  <cit> . both trees are in close agreement with the phylogeny inferred from the pancb genes . thus the phylogeny of r. etli and r. leguminosarum inferred from plasmid-encoded pancb genes is consistent with the phylogeny deduced from their housekeeping genes supporting the hypothesis of a chromosomal origin for the plasmid-encoded pancb genes.

the pancb genes do not fully complement the growth deficiency of a r. etli cfn <dig> p42f cured derivative in mm
it was reported previously that r. etli cfnx <dig>  a p42f-cured derivative of r. etli cfn <dig>  is unable to grow in mm  <cit> . to assess if the growth deficiency of strain cfnx <dig> in mm was due to the absence of the panc and panb genes, plasmid ptv <dig>  was introduced into strain cfnx <dig>  the growth of the transconjugant  after  <dig> hours of culture in mm was only 50% that of the wt strain grown under the same conditions . the growth of cfnx186- <dig> did not improve even after  <dig> h in culture . interestingly, strain cfnx186- <dig> had the same growth rate as strain cfnx <dig> cultured in mm supplemented with  <dig> μm calcium pantothenate . this shows that the growth deficiency of cfnx <dig> is only partly due to the absence of the pancb genes and indicates that other functions encoded in plasmid p42f are required for growth in mm.

previous studies have demonstrated that the katg gene, which encodes the sole catalase-peroxidase expressed in free-living growth conditions, is located on plasmid p42f of r. etli cfn <dig>  these studies also revealed that the growth rate of a katg mutant in mm was significantly reduced in comparison with that of the wild-type parental strain  <cit> . on plasmid p42f katg, as well as its putative transcriptional regulator protein encoded by oxyr, are located  <dig> bp downstream of the pancb genes. we speculated that introduction of the pancb genes together with the katg and oxyr genes might improve the growth of cfnx <dig> in mm. to test this hypothesis, we used pcos <dig>  which contains a  <dig> kb fragment of p42f carrying pancb, katg and oxyr . pcos <dig> was introduced into cfnx <dig> and the resulting transconjugant  grown in mm. figure  <dig> shows that after  <dig> hours of culture there was no significant difference between the growth rate of cfnx <dig> complemented only with pancb , and cfnx <dig> complemented with cosmid pcos <dig> . furthermore, the growth of cfnx186- <dig> did not increase even after  <dig> h of culture  indicating that katg and oxyr did not improve the growth rate of pancb complemented cfnx <dig> in mm. we also tested the possibility that arginine might improve the growth of strain cfnx186- <dig> due to the presence of a putative n-acetylornithinase  encoded in the plasmid p42f. in the enterobactericeae this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of n-acetylornithine to ornithine, a key step in the arginine biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . however, the growth deficiency of strain cfn186- <dig> in mm was not corrected by the addition of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm arginine . furthemore, we constructed an arge mutant strain  that was able to grow in mm without exogenous arginine at the same rate as parental strain cfn <dig> , confirming that this gene is not essential for arginine synthesis.

discussion
seminal studies on the phenotypic characterisation of plasmid-cured strains of r. leguminosarum and r. etli revealed that the absence of several plasmids cause a growth deficiency in rich and minimal medium  <cit> . these findings suggested that undefined metabolic traits are present on rhizobial plasmids. the bioinformatic analysis of  <dig> bacterial genomes performed by harrison et al  <cit>  revealed the presence of extrachromosomal core genes in  <dig> genomes mainly belonging to the proteobacteria. in contrast with these in silico data, there is little experimental information on the contribution of these core genes to bacterial metabolism or cellular process. the few genes that have been functionally characterized encode redundant functions and are totally dispensable for the cell  <cit> . our study provides experimental evidence that the enzymes mohmt  and pbal  encoded on plasmid p42f are indispensable for the synthesis of pantothenate. moreover, our results showed that the cluster of pancb, katg and oxyr genes was insufficient to restore full growth capacity to the p42f cured derivative cfnx <dig>  implying that in addition to pantothenate synthesis, there are more functions encoded on plasmid p42f required for growth in mm. obvious candidates for these functions could not be identified a priori among the  <dig> proteins encoded in p42f even though their predicted functions were recently updated with kaas . we discarded arginine limitation as the cause for the growth deficiency of strain cfnx186- <dig>  the arginine prototrophy displayed by a mutation in the p42f encoded arge suggests that in r. etli the conversion of n-acetylornithine to ornithine is catalyzed by the chromosome-encoded argj, an ornithine acetyltransferase , which transfers the acetyl group of n-acetylornithine to glutamate to produce ornithine and n-acetylglutamate. functional oatases have been found in the majority of bacteria  <cit> .

also, we have demonstrated that plasmid-localization of pancb in r. etli cfn <dig> is not unique to this strain. a screening of the location of pancb genes among members of the rhizobiales, showed that the occurrence of these genes in plasmids is a highly conserved trait among r. etli and r. leguminosarum strains. furthermore, the synteny of the pancb, oxyr, katg genes in r. etli cfn <dig> is conserved in r. etli ciat <dig> and in r. leguminosarum strains  <dig>  wsm <dig> and wsm <dig>  in contrast, genomes of rhizobium sp., sinorhizobium, bradyrhizobium and mesorhizobium species carried chromosomal pancb genes. only in a. tumefaciens c <dig> the pancb genes are localized in the linear chromosome, whereas in all other rhizobiales harboring secondary chromosomes the pancb genes were located in chromosome i. a bioinformatic analysis with microbesonline operon predictions  <cit>  indicates that pancb genes are organized as possible operons in most of the rhizobiales examined in this work: all these predicted operons conserve the four nucleotide overlap between the panc tga codon and the panb atg codon observed in r. etli cfn <dig> . in the genomes of bradyrhizobium sp. btai <dig>  nitrobacter hamburgensis x <dig>  methylobacterium extorquens am <dig>  methylobacterium radiotolerans jcm <dig> and xantobacter autotrophicus ry <dig>  panc and panb are encoded in separate chromosomal loci, whereas in methylobacterium nodulans ors <dig> panc is located in the chromosome and panb in plasmid pmnod <dig> 

the rhizobiales phylogeny inferred from concatenated panc and panb genes was consistent with the phylogeny deduced from  <dig> concatenated housekeeping genes. the low bootstrap values obtained for some nodes of the pancb phylogeny might be due to the small number of informative characters in the alignments of only two genes . this is consistent with previous reports that state that trees from longer alignments obtained by the concatenation of genes encoding multiple-protein families have higher bootstrap support than trees inferred from genes encoding single proteins  <cit> . the phylogenetic relationships among rhizobium species carrying pancb genes in plasmids with their closest relatives, agrobacterium and sinorhizobium species, harboring pancb genes in the chromosome was also observed in neighbor-joining trees inferred from single panc and panb genes . these data agree with the hypothesis that plasmid-encoded pancb genes are orthologs of the pancb genes located in chromosome. from these results, we propose that the presence of the pancb genes in plasmids in r. etli and r. leguminosarum species may be due to an intragenomic transfer event from chromosome to plasmid. the mechanism leading to the transfer of core genes from chromosome to plasmids could involve cointegration and excision events between the replicons, similar to rearrangements that have been visualized in s. meliloti  <cit> . the translocation of genes from chromosome to plasmids may be part of the complex evolution of multipartite genomes. a study based on the analysis of clusters of syntenic genes shared among plasmids and secondary chromosomes of bacteria with multipartite genomes suggested that secondary chromosomes may have originated from an ancestral plasmid to which genes had been transferred from a primary chromosome  <cit> .

our pioneering work on plasmid-encoded functions in r. etli cfn <dig> established that a functional relationship among different replicons is required for symbiotic and free-living functions  <cit> . more recently, a functional connectivity among most of the proteins encoded in the replicons of r. etli cfn <dig> was predicted in silico  <cit> . our results demonstrated that the putative mohmt encoded by rhe_pe <dig> is not functional under the conditions studied and provides evidence of functional cooperation between p42f and chromosomally encoded proteins for pantothenate biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that the presence of the core pancb genes in a plasmid is a characteristic conserved in r. etli and r. leguminosarum strains but not in other rhizobiales. the phylogenetic approach used in this study suggests that the unusual presence of pancb in plasmids may be due to an intragenomic transfer event from chromosome to plasmid rather than a xenologous gene displacement. using r. etli cfn <dig> as a model, we showed that the plasmid-encoded core pancb genes were indispensable for the synthesis of pantothenate. the pancb genes could not totally restore growth of a strain cured of plasmid p42f in minimal medium, suggesting that other functions essential for growth in this medium are encoded in this plasmid. our results support the hypothesis of functional cooperation among different replicons for basic cellular functions in multipartite rhizobial genomes.
