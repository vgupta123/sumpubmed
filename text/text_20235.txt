BACKGROUND
the genus lupinus, belongs to the subfamily papilionoideae of the leguminosae  forming an important part of papilionoideae, occupying the genistoid clade which is phylogenetically distinct from its sister clades. these sister clades contain the majority of scientifically and economically important legumes: aeschynomnoid-dalbergioids , phaseoloid-millettioids  and phaseolus vulgaris ) and the hologalegina clade . in the past decade, concerted efforts have been directed to understanding the genomics, evolution and biological characterisation of these sister clades  <cit> . however, genistoids are the least exploited group of legumes and lupins remain as one of the lesser studied legume crops.

lupins have traditionally been used for animal feed but are gaining recognition as a health food for humans, due to their unique dietary composition. the seeds contain a high level of protein  and dietary fibre , low oil and negligible starch, resulting in the lowest recorded glycaemic index of any commercial grain crop  <cit> . the protein content in lupin seed is similar to that in soybean, but lupin has lower levels of phytoestrogens which may potentially constitute a significant health risk  <cit> . thus, lupins are an attractive alternative to soybean. moreover, lupin seeds also contain constituents that alter satiety and other features of human health with the prospect of pharmaceutical potential  <cit> . with increased incidence of obesity and the associated risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, lupins are an excellent candidate as a healthy food.

lupins are adapted to a range of highly divergent climatic and environmental conditions  <cit> , providing direct and indirect benefits in rotation with cereal crops under rain fed conditions and limited soil nutrient supply. despite their agronomic potential lupins are not widely exploited and, as a consequence, have not attracted the intense molecular research required for genomic characterisation. in contrast, a wealth of genomic resources has been generated for two model legumes, medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus  <cit> . in recent years, genetic and genomic resources have also been developed to different degrees for other major grain and pasture legume crops, including pea , soybean , common bean , mung bean , chickpea , cowpea , pigeon pea , groundnut  and clover   <cit> . for lupin, the major significant advances have been the establishment of draft genetic maps for both nll and white lupin , which employed a variety of techniques and markers. the majority of the markers were derived from comparative genomics among related legume and non-legume species  <cit> . also in white lupin candidate genes and proteins associated with antimicrobial defense and heavy-metal uptake have been identified using genomic and proteomic approaches  <cit>  as have a large number of proteins, transcripts and micrornas present in the phloem translocation stream  <cit> . for nll, a limited number of ests and genomic sequences have been submitted to the ncbi databases, and a narrow-leafed lupin bac library from cv sonet has been constructed with  <dig> × coverage of the genome  <cit> . nevertheless, to facilitate the fast growing research activities in lupins, additional genomic and genetic resources are needed. the genomic and genetic resources can also benefit comparative genomic studies with other legumes.

bac libraries and bac-end sequences are valuable resources, which have contributed significantly to genetic and genomic studies of a wide range of model or economically important plant species . using bac-end sequencing, a large number of ssr markers have been identified which have in turn provided tools for developing the genetic and physical maps of legumes such as g. max, t. repens l, c. arietinum and c. cajan  <cit> . bac-end sequences have permitted identification of macro- and micro-synteny between species and have provided accurate and cost-effective means to estimate genome properties such as genome organisation and composition of some legume crops  <cit> .

this study reports the construction and characterisation of a nuclear-genome bac library of the nll cv. tanjil. cv. tanjil was one of the parents used for two recombinant inbred line  populations that segregated for important domestication traits such as early flowering, bitterness , pod shattering, water permeability of seed and resistance to anthracnose  <cit> . these populations have been important for development of molecular markers and genetic maps for the species. moreover, cv. tanjil has been chosen as the reference genome to be sequenced in a genome sequencing project that commenced in  <dig>  the bac library for this cultivar was constructed using the bamhi restriction enzyme and was successfully used to obtain bac clones containing different members of the major seed storage protein, β-conglutin, family. in order to help determine the structure and composition of the nll genome,  <dig> randomly selected bac clones were sequenced generating  <dig> bac end-sequences . based on estimates that the genome size of nll is  <dig> mbp  <cit> , these bess covered approximately 1% of the genome. the nll bess provided useful information on the genome composition and organisation of the nll genome. we also used the bess to identify  <dig> ssr motifs, some of which were shown to be potential molecular markers.

RESULTS
construction of a bac library from nll cv tanjil
a nll cv. tanjil bac library was constructed from hydroponically grown seedlings using the bamh <dig> restriction enzyme. the library comprised of  <dig>  bac clones which were stored in  <dig> 384-well microtitre plates. the average insert size of the library was approximately  <dig>  kb based on the analysis of ca.  <dig> randomly selected clones. approximately 2% of the clones contained no insert while the majority  had insert sizes of between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb,  <dig> % above  <dig> kb,  <dig> % between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, 3% between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb and  <dig> % smaller than  <dig> kb. the coverage of the library was estimated to be around  <dig> haploid genome equivalents according to the  genome size estimate of approximately  <dig> mbp for nll  <cit> .

screening the bac library for β-conglutin containing clones
to demonstrate the utility of the library,  <dig>  bac clones which were double-spotted onto six nylon membrane filters using a robot were screened for nll β-conglutin genes using a cdna fragment from a β-conglutin gene  as the probe  <cit> . this cdna probe cross-hybridised to the other six members of the β-conglutin gene family due to the high level of homology among the gene sequences  <cit> . the screening permitted  <dig> positive clones to be identified. twelve clones were randomly selected and confirmed to contain β-conglutin gene by pcr with a pair of primers able to recognise all seven β-conglutin gene members.

characterisation of β-conglutin containing bac clones
for further analysis, eight of the bac clones were analysed for the presence of specific β-conglutin genes by pcr using primers and annealing temperatures specific for each β-conglutin gene, followed by sequencing of the pcr product. as shown in figure  <dig>  each of the eight β-conglutin hybridising bac clones contained β-conglutin genes, including beta <dig>  beta <dig>  beta <dig>  beta <dig>  and a new β-conglutin gene, recognised by beta <dig> primers, which has been renamed, beta <dig>  the truncated sequences of the eight β-conglutin genes are shown in additional file  <dig>  it is not clear why the beta <dig> primers recognised beta <dig> sequences from bacb but not from bacf. beta <dig> primers detected two bands from bach, however sequence data showed that they both contained beta <dig> sequences, indicating a pcr aberration. beta <dig> primers identified a product with sequence identity to beta <dig> except there was an extra  <dig> bp, presumably an intron within beta <dig>  apart from bacf, which contained beta <dig> and beta <dig>  each bac clone only contained one β-conglutin gene.

predicting characteristics of the nll genome from bioinformatic analysis of a randomly sampled collection of bac-end sequences
to provide insight into the sequence content and complexity of the nll genome, we sequenced and analyzed both ends of  <dig> bac clones randomly selected from the library and generated a total of  <dig> bac-end sequences . among these sequences,  <dig> bess  of bac-end sequences contained usable sequence data  with a total length of ca.  <dig>  mbp which covers  <dig> % of the nll genome. the average length of the bess was  <dig> bp with a maximum of  <dig> bp and minimum of  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig> of the bess were discarded, because sequences were too short , matched to the vector, showed low complexity or were identified as bacterial or organelle sequences.

applying bioinformatic analyses to the  <dig> high-quality bess permitted prediction of various characteristics of the whole nll genome. the overall g:c content of bess was 39%. however, the g:c content within predicted gene-coding regions was higher at 45%. within the  <dig>  mbp of bes sequence data, a total of  <dig> repeats were identified representing  <dig> % of the genome. long terminal repeat  retrotransposons were the most abundant class of transposable elements, constituting  <dig> % of the genome . the most abundant ltr retroelements were ty1/copia-like repeats , followed by gypsy/dirs1-like repeats . other repeats, including  <dig> simple repeats ,  <dig> low complexity repeats ,  <dig> dna transposons  and  <dig> rdna repeats  were also identified.

to estimate the protein-encoding gene content of the nll genome, the  <dig> bess were compared to the ncbi nr protein database by blastx. protein-matching regions were found in  <dig> bess,  <dig> of which also contained matches to known repetitive dna sequences. putative gene-encoding regions totalled  <dig>  bp, equivalent to  <dig> % of the total bes dataset. based on this value and an estimated average gene length of  <dig> bp in legume species and  <dig> bp over all plant species  the nll genome was predicted to contain between  <dig> and  <dig> genes. blast2go assigned  <dig> gene ontology  terms to  <dig> bess . go annotations were converted to  <dig> funcat annotations assigned to  <dig> bess .

functional analysis of the encoded genes in the  <dig> bess predicted high proportions of the nll gene content involved in the cell cycle and dna processing , protein binding , protein folding and modification , organelle proteins  and metabolism  . a summary of gene ontology revealed a relatively higher proportion within the nll bess of genes associated with dna metabolism, proteolysis, auxin biosynthesis, cellular processes, primary metabolism, oxidation and reduction and serine family amino acid metabolism . conversely, there was a relative scarcity in the bess of genes involved in organ formation, signal transduction, transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, alkaloid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism and defense/stress responses .

comparative genomics between nll and other plant species
to examine the phylogenetic relationship between nll and sequenced species, the  <dig> quality-screened bess were aligned  to the ncbi nucleotide database and the probable phylogenetic distribution of these hits was visualised with megan  <cit>  . megan indicated the level of species similarity and sequence conservation within the randomly sampled bes subset of the nll genome. about  <dig> % of bess matched sequences available in the ncbi nucleotide database, while  <dig> % of bess had no hits. this is due in part to the relatively low number of sequences from lupinus and other closely related genera that are currently available. the majority  of the matched bess were mapped to eudicotyledon species,  <dig> % of which were assigned to the species of the subfamily papilionoideae . the three sequenced leguminous species, g. max, l. japonicus and m. truncatula, were highly represented followed by the genera lupinus and arachis. in contrast, there were only six nll bess that were best aligned to arabidopsis sequences and no bess specifically aligned to oryza sativa. the average percent identity of blastn alignments between nll bess and g. max, m. truncatula and l. japonicus was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. however the average identity restricted to predicted gene-encoded regions was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. a small proportion of bess  were aligned to proteobacteria, perhaps due to the fact that the tissues for constructing the bac library were collected from lupin seedlings grown under non-sterile conditions.

simple sequence repeat  profiling and ssr markers
to characterise nll ssrs and compare them with those from m. truncatula, g. max, l. japonicus, arabidopsis and o. sativa, ssrs were predicted using methods described previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> nll ssr motifs were found in the  <dig> bess. details of these ssrs, including the repeat length, repeat motif, and repeat period are presented in additional file  <dig>  the ssrs were divided into two classes: class i  and class ii   <cit> . the frequency of these ssr classes for all six species is compared in table  <dig>  consistent with data for the other five species, class ii ssrs in nll were the most abundant microsatellites, being ca.  <dig> fold greater in frequency than class i ssrs. the individual frequencies of ssrs appeared to be lower in nll than in the other five species. based on the  <dig>  mbp of sequence  obtained from the bes data, the average density for the class i  ssrs was approximately one ssr every  <dig>  kbp which is slightly higher than one ssr every  <dig> - <dig>  kbp for the other five species. for the class ii ssrs , the nll ssrs appeared to be much less frequent and the average distance between ssrs was over six times that of soybean and three to four times that of the other four species.

†mono-: mono-nucleotide repeats; di-: di-nucleotide repeats; tri-: tri-nucleotide repeats; tetra-: tetra-nucleotide repeats;

penta-: penta-nucleotide repeats, texa-: texa- nucleotide repeats; hepta-: hepta- nucleotide repeats; octa-: octa- nucleotide repeats.

however, analysis of the relative frequency of individual groups of ssrs with motif length 1- <dig> bp revealed some major trends for all six species as well as some distinctions for nll ssrs . while the di-nucleotide ssrs in nll were the most abundant of all the class i ssrs , in line with the other  <dig> species, the mono- and octa-nucleotide ssrs showed higher representation and the tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide ssrs lower representation in nll than those in other species. in contrast, the distribution of the relative abundance of each repeat motif length of the class ii ssrs  in nll appeared consistent with that in the other species. penta-nucleotide ssrs were an exception, and were relatively more abundant by about four times in nll, than those of the other species. in the combination of both class i and class ii ssrs, nll appeared to have higher abundance of mono-nucleotide ssrs and lower abundance of tri- and tetra-nucleotide ssrs. in nll, most of the penta-nucleotide ssrs had short repeat sequences and grouped into class ii .

to develop ssr markers for nll, primer-pairs were designed flanking  <dig> ssrs using primer <dig>  <cit>  with additional criteria described in the materials and methods. after taking repetitive sequences into account, there were  <dig> non-redundant ssr marker candidates including  <dig> class i ssrs  and  <dig> class ii ssrs . these ssrs and the details of their primers are shown in additional file  <dig>  twenty four additional class i ssr markers were designed using less stringent criteria . the details of these  <dig> ssrs are shown in additional file  <dig> 

a subset of  <dig> class i ssr primer pairs were used to establish a high throughput genetic mapping procedure for nll, termed 'multiplex-ready pcr' , to determine the success rate of the identified ssrs as polymorphic markers between the parents of two nll recombinant inbred line  populations. one ril population was a narrow cross  and the other was a wide cross   <cit> . the number of alleles that the primers amplified and their lengths are presented in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> primer pairs tested,  <dig> did not yield any amplicons and four were monomorphic between all four nll lines tested. the remaining  <dig> markers yielded single amplicons corresponding to their expected sizes based on the bes data. two out of these  <dig> primer pairs also generated secondary amplicons for all four nll lines. interestingly, the wild nll line p <dig> had an additional two primer pairs that yielded multiple amplicons, whereas the other three domesticated nll lines did not. given that the bess only cover  <dig>  mbp of the nll lupin genome, the amplification of multiple products by a given primer pair could not be ruled out, but this appeared to be limited to only a few primer pairs.

as expected the "wild" nll line, p <dig>  was the most divergent, with the three domesticated lines being closely conserved . nine out of  <dig> markers were polymorphic between the parents of the narrow cross , whereas  <dig> markers were polymorphic between the parents of the wide cross .

discussion
a deep coverage and high quality bac library was constructed for the nll cultivar tanjil, which is emerging as the reference genome for this species. the cv. tanjil bac library represents ca.  <dig> × haploid genome equivalents. it complements the previous nll bac library constructed using a different restriction enzyme  and a different nll genotype   <cit> . the library contains very low organelle contamination . the quality of the library described here has been verified through the bac-end sequencing of  <dig> clones and the successful screening of the library with a probe for the nll β-conglutin genes . this nll bac library together with the pre-existing bac library will help develop genetic and genomic tools for lupins and identify useful lupin genes for crop improvement and in relation to human health. indeed, the screening of the nll bac library has resulted in the identification of a large number of bac clones containing various types of β-conglutin genes . the nll β-conglutins are potential lupin-specific allergens  <cit>  and their further characterisation will verify their structures and functions, thereby ultimately helping reduce allergenicity problems, potentially through a genetic engineering approach.

the bac-end sequencing of  <dig> randomly selected bac clones represents the initial phase of efforts to characterise the nll genome. the bac-end sequencing represents a random sampling of ca. 1% of the nll genome. therefore these bess provide a preliminary genome-wide survey and facilitate comparisons with well-characterised legume and closely related non-legume species. the g:c content of nll  is slightly higher than estimates in related legume species: p. sativum , g. max , m. truncatula , l. japonicus  and trifolium pratense   <cit> . the bess generated were sufficient to reconstruct and analyse the relative proportions of major repeat families. based on the bess obtained, the repetitive content in nll is estimated to be at least  <dig> % of the genome, which is close to lotus japonicus  and much lower than those of m. truncatula   <cit> , soybean   <cit>  and pea   <cit> . however, with additional sequence data this estimate will likely increase, as greater whole-genome coverage allows for de novo prediction of repetitive elements novel to nll. ltr-retrotransposons were found to be the major component of repetitive dna in nll, similar to most higher plants characterised to date  <cit> . it appears that nll has a relatively higher proportion of ty1/copia than gypsy/dirs <dig> repeat elements compared to soybean and pea  <cit> , possibly reflecting a distinct evolutionary history specific to lupins and/or the genistoid clade.

the de novo sequencing of the nll cv. tanjil genome is underway and will involve sequencing  <dig> bp illumina reads from a range of small , medium  and large  sized paired-end and mate-paired libraries. in addition to providing an initial genome survey and contributing new polymorphic markers, the bes dataset can be combined with these next-generation reads in the final genome assembly to connect scaffolds together across large assembly gaps. where necessary, the bess will also facilitate sequencing across gaps between scaffolds, as bac clones corresponding to a bes in the vicinity of a gap can be isolated and sequenced individually.

the bess described here are already being used to support the genome-wide identification of polymorphic genetic markers, such as ssrs with a total of  <dig> ssr motifs identified. the analysis of the ssr profiles suggested some degree of consistency in the relative abundances of ssrs in nll and other more characterised species . for example, consistent with m. truncatula, l. japonicus, g. max, o. sativa and arabidopsis, class i di-nucleotide ssrs and class ii hexa-nucleotide ssrs were the most abundant  <cit> . however, in nll, the class i octa-nucleotide ssrs were also relatively overrepresented and penta-nucleotide ssrs were underrepresented. conversely class ii penta-nucleotide ssrs were relatively overrepresented and tri-nucleotide ssrs were underrepresented in nll. the divergence of ssr abundance has also been documented for other types of ssrs  <cit> .

the average density for the class i ssrs was approximately one ssr every  <dig>  kbp which is comparable to one ssr every  <dig> - <dig>  kbp for the other five species compared. the average density for the class ii ssrs however, was significantly less frequent  compared to the other five plant species . this could be due to the relatively small nll sample size or alternatively, the result may reflect the distinct phylogenetic placement of nll compared to the other species.

class i ssrs, which have longer repeat sequences and/or higher number of repeat units, are generally more mutable and thus more likely to be polymorphic between species than the ssrs with shorter repeat sequences and/or lower number of repeat units  <cit> . forty eight candidate class i ssr markers were identified and  <dig> of these were initially screened for polymorphism between the parents of two ril populations yielding nine and  <dig> novel ssr markers for the cv. tanjil × cv. unicrop and "wild" × "domestic" ril populations, respectively. the degree of polymorphism in the initial set of class i ssrs between these four nll lines shows that this is an effective way to identify and develop novel molecular markers. the majority of existing markers developed in nll are aflps, mflps and rflps  <cit> . besides these markers,  <dig> polymorphic pcr based markers are currently available in nll and of these  <dig> pcr based markers,  <dig> are ssr markers  <cit> . none of the  <dig> pcr-based markers produced amplicons within the bess presented in this publication by in silico pcr   <cit> . the ssr markers presented in this study are therefore novel and are specific to regions of the nll genome which have not been previously used for primer-based marker design. ssr markers are valuable tools that can be applied to the study of genetic diversity within collections, for example of lupinus species and between cultivars  <cit>  as well as refining existing genetic maps using high-throughput "multiplex-ready pcr", which has now been established for nll. the ssr markers are also potentially useful for marker-assisted breeding across lupinus species and other related species.

phylogenetic analysis of the nll bess indicated only a small proportion  of nll bess matched to the ncbi nucleotide database and the majority  of these were assigned to the species of the subfamily papilionoideae of the leguminosae. a large proportion of bess  did not match to any available legume nucleotide sequences despite almost full genome sequences being available for three species . this result suggests that there is significant genomic disparity between the genistoid clade and other clades of the papilionoideae subfamily. this further illustrates how selective sequencing of certain taxons can create biases in bioinformatic analysis and highlights the importance of exploring the nll genome and the development of its genomic resources. the nll bess generated in this study represent the first genome-wide dataset for the genus lupinus and provide an excellent foundation to further understand the evolution of the leguminosae family.

CONCLUSIONS
nll is emerging as an important crop for agriculture and human health. as genetic and genomic studies in nll within the genus lupinus have been limited, the bac library, the bac-end sequences, and the ssrs markers described in this study are additional genomic resources for the species. these resources are critical for the construction of high-density physical and genetic maps and are valuable resources for map-based cloning and functional analysis of traits in lupin. they will greatly facilitate development of molecular and genetic tools for identifying and characterising genes involved in lupin crop improvement and in exploiting the crop for human nutrition. in addition, these resources provide a framework for further comparative genomics between lupins and other legumes and ongoing efforts towards assembling the complete nll genome using next-generation sequencing.
