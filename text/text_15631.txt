BACKGROUND
brain cancer is a very complex and deadly disease. traditional diagnoses and treatments of this disease are from in vitro experimental observations. although biologists have developed many experimental data at the molecular, cellular, micro-environmental and tissue scales, only very few scientists have integrated these data into multi-scale models to study tumor response to treatment.

cellular automata  methods have been widely applied to model brain tumor growth  <cit> . although ca models are good at describing cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions, this type of discrete modelling approach falls short on investigating most fluid dynamic aspects of the tumor microenvironment. alternatively, continuum models employ systems of partial differential equations to simulate the solid tumor invasion by updating boundaries of different sub-domains of tumor based on the level-set method  <cit> . it is, however, hard with this approach to describe cell-cell interactions, such as the competition among cells for nutrients. in general neither continuum nor discrete models can accurately simulate cancer spatio-temporal evolution with respect to the complexity of cancer. a hybrid discrete-continuum  model that couples a cellular automaton module with a continuum module was proposed by anderson and co-workers  <cit> . although these models have not considered the effects of any gene-protein signaling pathways such as the egfr pathway, computational cancer biologists have already studied them extensively. recent studies showed that egfr pathway plays an important role in the evolution of brain cancer  <cit> . therefore, the existing multi-scale agent-based tumor models incorporated an egfr signaling pathway  <cit>  at the molecular scale to enable individual cells to choose their phenotypic trait between proliferation and migration based on the pathway's state  <cit> . as indicated by hanahan and weinberg <cit> , angiogenesis is a significant transforming phase in tumor growth. during the angiogenesis phase, tumor cells secret vascular endothelial growth factors   <cit>  into the microenvironment to induce and sustain new capillary sprouts migrating from pre-existing vasculature towards the tumor. this in turn helps to maintain tumor cells’ metabolism by supplying them with glucose and oxygen and subsequently leads to metastasis. however, our previous agent-based models  <cit>  did not explicitly take tumor-induced angiogenesis into consideration.

in this paper, we presented a novel multi-scale agent-based model to describe tumor growth with angiogenesis and study the response of brain cancer to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors   <cit> . several rates of changes of molecular species, such as plcγ, cdh <dig> and cyccdk will determine a tumor cell’s phenotypic switch.

in order to integrate an angiogenesis module into the existing agent-based tumor growth models  <cit> , we developed a set of rules that underline the migration of endothelial cells and the branching of vessel sprouts. compared to previous developed hdc rules  <cit> , these rules which directly defined the probabilities of migration of endothelia cells are more suitable for implementation into an agent-based model. the tumor growth and angiogenesis are coupled through vegf secreted by the tumor cells and through the glucose and oxygen permeated from the neo-vasculature. as the neo-vasculature develops, glucose and oxygen penetrate from the blood vessels and diffuse throughout the tumor microenvironment to promote further tumor growth, which in turn influences the concentration of vegf.

the simulation results demonstrate that we can investigate the response of brain cancer to tyrosine kinase inhibitors  and also can use the model to reveal the dual role of angiogenesis.

implementation
our model encompasses four biological scales : the molecular scale, the cellular scale, the micro-environmental scale and the tissue scale. the molecular scale consists of the egfr signaling and cell cycle pathways . the cellular scale describes the phenotypic switch of the tumor cells which is determined by the molecular scale, the cell-cell and the cell-microenvironment interactions . the micro-environmental scale provides a connection between the micro-vasculature  and the tumor cells. tumor cells consume glucose and oxygen nutrients. transforming growth factor alpha  secreted by tumor cells triggers the egfr signaling pathway, which in turn determines cell’s phenotypic switch. oxygen plays an important role in the cell cycle during the proliferation phase. the vegf secreted by the tumor cells induces angiogenesis. meanwhile, tgfα, glucose, oxygen and vegf diffuse continuously in the tumor microenvironment. the tissue scale focuses on angiogenesis . blood vessel sprouts migrate and branch via tip endothelial cells' migration in response to vegf chemotaxis and fibronectin haptotaxis. the new blood vessels supply tumor cells with glucose and oxygen to maintain their metabolism and further invasion.

we performed our simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. the lattice size was set to l =  <dig> representing a 4 ~  <dig> mm length of a brain tissue slice. the lattice spacing is 20 μm, which is approximately the diameter of tumor cells. initially a parent blood vessel along with  <dig> tip endothelial cells is located near the left boundary of the computational domain. also a small cluster of active tumor cells were randomly distributed as shown in figure  <dig>  each tumor cell is initialized with its age being between 0 ~  <dig> hours randomly. the time step of the simulation is one hour. the details of the model parameters are in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of this paper.

molecular scale: signaling pathway
the concentration of each component  in the egfr signaling  <cit>  and cell-cycle pathways  <cit>  are described by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations  in the form

  dxi/dt=∑v+−∑v_ 

where v+ represents the production rate of xi and v_ the consumption rate. the parameters of odes are in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  parameter sensitivity and model robustness analysis are presented in the results section. these methods enabled us to determine which parameters of the system are more sensitive as well as to examine if the system is robust enough to the small parameter perturbations.

cellular scale: phenotype switch of tumor cells as "agents"
at every simulation step, each "agent"  switches its phenotype according to the following rules:

 <dig>  first, each agent evaluates the concentration of glucose at its current location. if the concentration is greater than the cell active threshold, the agent becomes active and uses its egfr signaling pathway to determine its phenotype. if the concentration of glucose is less than the dead threshold, the cell dies. if the concentration is between active and dead thresholds, the agent enters into a reversible quiescent state  <cit> .

 <dig>  each active agent evaluates its migration potential  by the following equation:

  mpplcγ=dplcγ/dt, 

where d/dt is the rate of change of the plcγ concentration. if mp is greater than a threshold σplcγ, the average rate of change of plcγ concentration, the agent will choose the migration phenotype.

 <dig>  if mp is less than σplcγ, the agent starts to proliferate. if the concentration of cdh <dig> is less than a threshold thr <dig> and the concentration of cyccdk is greater than the threshold thr <dig>  the cell divides. after that, the cell chooses the most attractive free site

) in the neighborhood to deliver its offspring. if there is no empty neighborhood, the cell turns into a reversible quiescent state until free space becomes available.

 <dig>  each agent chooses the "most attractive" location mentioned above according to the following probability:

  pj=ψgj/fj+1−ψεj, 

where gj is the glucose concentration at location j, fj is the fibronectin concentration at j, εj ~n is a normally distributed error term, the parameter ψ ∈ represents the extent of the search precision, which is set to  <dig>   <cit> .

microenvironmental scale: extracellular chemotaxis
five extracellular micro-environmental factors, glucose, oxygen, tgfα, vegf and fibronectin are included in this model. a set of reaction–diffusion equations describe the diffusion, penetration and uptake of glucose, oxygen and vegf.

glucose first penetrates blood vessels, and then diffuses in the extracellular microenvironment. after that, it is consumed by the tumor cells. this process is modeled by the following equation:

  ∂g∂t=dgΔg+xvest,xqggblood-g−xtumt,xug, 

where g is the glucose concentration, Δ≡∇ <dig> is the laplace operator, dg is the diffusivity of glucose. qg = 2πrpg, where pg is the vessel permeability for glucose and r is the blood vessels' average radius. in addition, gblood is the glucose concentration in blood and ug is the cell’s glucose uptake rate. the time dependent characteristic function xves  is equal to  <dig>  if a blood vessel is present at x; otherwise it is equal to  <dig>  xtum  is equal to  <dig> in the tumor region and is equal to  <dig> elsewhere. xves and xtum are updated at each simulation step according to the developing profile of the tumor and its micro-vascularity.

oxygen also permeates the blood vessels' walls, diffuses in the surrounding and is consumed by tumor cells. this process is modeled by the following equation:

  ∂c∂t=dcΔc+xvest,xqccblood−c−xtumt,xuc, 

where c is the oxygen concentration, dc is the oxygen diffusivity, qc is the vessel permeability for oxygen, and uc is a cell’s uptake rate of oxygen.

tgfα, an analogue of egf, is secreted by tumor cells and can be paracrine and juxtacrine  <cit> . equation  describes the diffusion and secretion of tgfα.

  ∂t∂t=dtΔt−xvest,xqtt+xtumt,xst−δtt, 

where t is the tgfα concentration, dt is its diffusivity, qt is vessel permeability to tgfα. st is a cell’s net production rate of tgfα and δt is the natural decay rate of tgfα.

we applied homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for all the above equations by assuming zero flux along the boundary of the considered domain. additional file 5: table a <dig> and additional file 6: equations a1–a <dig> list the parameters and initial conditions of the equations. we solved these equations numerically with the finite difference method  <cit> .

tissue scale: angiogenesis
tumor induced angiogenesis is due to the secretion of vegf by the tumor cells. vegf diffuses into the surrounding corneal tissue and is also consumed by the endothelial cells  <cit> . we model this process with the following equation:

  ∂v∂t=dvΔv−xvest,xqvv+xtumt,xsv−δvv, 

where v is the vegf concentration, dv is the diffusivity of vegf, qv is the vessel permeability for vegf and sv is a cell’s vegf secretion rate. δv is the natural decay rate of vegf.

fibronectin is a component of the corneal tissue secreted by endothelial cells. in addition, tumor cells can consume fibronectin. this process is described by the following equation:

  ∂f∂t=xvest,xβ−xtumt,xγf, 

where f is the fibronectin concentration, β and γ are positive constants representing the production and uptake rates, respectively.

we assume that the motion of individual endothelial cell  located at the tip of a capillary sprout governs the motion of the whole sprout. chemotaxis in response to vegf gradients and haptotaxis in response to fibronectin are the major factors that influence the motion of the endothelial cells at the capillary sprout tip  <cit> .

we defined the probability of migration of a tip endothelial cell  as

  pk∝αkvkv+v∇v+λ∇f.lk,⋯⋯k= <dig> , <dig> , 

where v is the vegf concentration, f is fibronection concentration and lk is the directional vector along the kth direction. the term αkv/kv+v ∇v models chemotaxis in response to vegf gradients  <cit> , where α is the chemotactic coefficient and kv is a positive constant controlling the weight of vegf concentration in chemotactic sensitivity. the term λ∇f models the haptotatic influence of fibronectin on the endothelial cells, where λ is the haptotatic coefficient.

for a given tip of endothelial cells at location , the un-normalized migration probabilities can be calculated from equation  as follows:

  p1=αkv/kv+vi,j)·−f),p2=αkv/kv+vi,j)·−f),p3=αkv/kv+vi,j)·−f),p4=αkv/kv+vi,j)·−f). 

the un-normalized probability p <dig>  for a tip cell to remain stationary is the average of p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  after normalization, the above equations give the likelihood of the tip endothelial cell to move up, down, right, or left, or stay at its current position. the probability, p <dig>  for a tip cell to remain stationary is the average of p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> 

the algorithm related to angiogenesis is as follows:

 <dig>  calculate the migration probabilities of ecs:

 <dig>  solve the equations  and , and then calculate p1-p <dig> from ;

 <dig>  normalize the above numbers: p˜i=pi/∑j=15pj,.i= <dig> ,…,5; define intervals i1= ∂tki∂t=dtkiΔtki+xvest,xqtkitkiblood−tki−xtumt,xutki−δtkitki, 

where dtki is the diffusivity of the tkis, qtki is the vessel permeability for tkis, tkiblood is the blood tkis concentration, utki is a cell’s uptake rate of tkis, and δtki is the natural decay rate of tkis.

the egfr signaling pathway controls a cell’s phenotypic switch by binding tgfα molecules to the egf receptors. because the tki molecules inhibit the autophosphorylation receptors, the downstream egfr pathway responsible for a cell's phenotypic switch remains inactivated  <cit> . the binding and unbinding processes of tkis to egfr with constant rates kb and ku, respectively, are described by the following equation:

  egfr+tki⇄kukbegfr:tki 

since the chemical reaction rate is much faster than the cells' phenotypic switch  <cit> , the concentration of egfr: tki complex in equation  can be obtained by applying michaelis–menten kinetics as follows:

  egfr:tki=egfr0tkikm+tki 

where km is the michaelis constant, km ≈ kb / ku, and  <dig> is the initial concentration of the egfr. we can then derive the effective amount of egfr for the activation of downstream factors as follows:

  egfreff=egfr0−egfr:tki 

because of the tki treatment, the effective amount of egfr of some tumor cells will decrease. the decrease of the amount of effective egfr results in a slow rate of change of plcγ concentration. this in turn inhibits tumor progression by reducing the migration potential of these tumor cells .

finally, we summarize our computing algorithm at each step across multi-scales  as follows. at micro-environmental scale, we solve the pdes  to obtain the spatial concentration distributions of glucose, oxygen and tgfα. at molecular scale, we use the calculated local tgfα concentration as the input for egfr signaling pathway  for each tumor cell. at cellular scale, tumor cells' migration potential   is computed to determine their phenotypic switch ; meanwhile, other phenotypic switches  are associated with the current value of oxygen and glucose. at tissue scale, the spatial concentration distributions of vegf and fibronectin  will guide the tip endothelial cells' migration and sprout branching. in turn, the remodeled vasculature at tissue scale influences the spatial concentration distributions of glucose, oxygen and tgfα at micro-environmental scale. for tki treatment, the tki distribution is integrated into molecular scale by solving equation  <dig> along with aforementioned equations 4– <dig>  and the initial value of egfr is varied by equations 12– <dig> as well.

RESULTS
we have implemented the above model into software "abm-tki" in the matlab programming environment. “abm-tki” is a tool employing agent-based model  to simulate brain tumor growth. it includes an egfr signaling pathway, a related cell-cycle, angiogenesis and tkis treatment. we can employ this tool to predict the responses of brain cancer and reveal the dual roles of angiogenesis under tki treatment.

regarding software usage, the user can download and decompress the package from the project home page . then the user can run the program in matlab  with input as: angiog_tumor.the input "time" is the period from the beginning of the simulation to the end. the "isdrug = 1" means tki treatment and "isdrug = 0" means no tki treatment. for example: "angiog_tumor" will give the tumor growth profile without tki treatment from  <dig> hour to  <dig> hours; "angiog_tumor" will give the tumor growth profile with tki treatment from  <dig> hour to  <dig> hours.

the output includes:  the vascular tumor growth pattern with or without tki treatment;  the tumor growth visualization with the background of fibronectin;  the spatio-temporal evolution of the concentration of glucose, oxygen, tgfα and/or tki;  various tumor cell numbers such as active cells, apoptotic cells, migratory cells, proliferative cells, quiescent cells and the number of endothelial cells;  the average change rate of plcγ with or without tki treatment.

vascular tumor growth patterns
the vascularized tumor patterns at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours are shown in figure 5a, where different colors denote various tumor cell states: active , quiescent , dead  and proliferative . the endothelial cells are red. . the active tumor cells are comprised of migratory cells, cells that have just completed their proliferation process, and cells that just switched back from quiescent state to the active state. additional file 8: figure a <dig> shows the growth of the tumor microvascularity and the fibronectin concentration at different time interval. figure 5a showed that those tumor cells tend to migrate to locations near the vessels, where the glucose concentration level is the highest. around t =  <dig> hours, the tumor was comprised of active cells and some quiescent cells. around t =  <dig> hours some dead cells appeared in the tumor mass. from t =  <dig> hours to t =  <dig> hours, the number of both dead and active cells kept increasing. at t =  <dig> hours, we found that some quiescent cells near blood vessels switched back to active cells. at this time, the tumor developed a tree branching microvasculature, which is much denser near the tumor. figure 5b shows the distributions of different micro-environmental factors  at t =  <dig> hours. given the space limitation, we show the results at a single time interval. the concentrations of these molecules at different times are shown in the additional file 9: figure a <dig>  with different colors representing different levels of concentration. we found that the descending order of the diffusion rate for the four molecular species is as follows: oxygen, glucose, vegf or tgfα.

in figure 5d, we present the proliferation rate of tumor cells as a function of time from our simulation and from in vitro experimental results   <cit> . the in vitro experimental data are from human glioma tumor-initiating cells derived from  <dig> patients . the plotted experimental data are the mean and standard deviation values from the seven cell lines. we took the mean value of these data as the blue line in figure 5d. the mean squared error of our prediction is  <dig> . the simulation and experimental data in figure 5d are in very good agreement, which is an important validation of our model.

tki treatment response
in our study we chose gefitinib as the egfr tki to treat brain cancer. in this section the term tki refers to treating cell by gefitinib. figure 6a shows the simulation profiles of the vascularized tumor growth with tki treatment from t =  <dig> to  <dig> hours. the different colors represent cell types as defined in figure 5a. the results in figure 6a show that the tumor expansion slowed down obviously by the tki treatment. additional files 11- 12: figure a5- <dig> show the detailed vascular tumor growth profile with tki treatment as well as that in the presence of fibronectin at different time intervals.

sensitivity analysis and model robustness
parameter sensitivity analysis is to quantitatively discover sensitive parameters in the system. and robustness analysis is to examine whether the system is stable to modest fluctuations of these sensitive parameter values.

in this work, local parameter sensitivity analysis  <cit>  was employed to understand the relationship between the migration potential  of tumor cell and the variations in individual parameter values. the sensitivity coefficient  is calculated according to the following formula  <cit> :

  s=Δmpmp/Δpp, 

where p is the parameter that is varied and mp is tumor cell's migration potential; Δmp is the corresponding change in mp due to a small change in p denoted by Δp. each individual parameter is increased  by 10% from its original value, and the resulting percentage change of the migration potential is computed. figure  <dig> shows that the migration potential of the cells is most sensitive to the initial concentration of egfr  and tgfα . the sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that kinetic rates, k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and v <dig>  are more critical than others in the system. furthermore, it turns out that the developed intracellular pathway system is rather robust since all of the sensitivity coefficients are less than  <dig> %.

based on above sensitivity analysis results, we selected  <dig> pathway components, tgfα , egfr  and plcγ , and  <dig> kinetic rates including k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and v <dig> as key parameters to investigate the robustness of the model to much larger ranges of parameter variations. for each of these parameters, we varied its value by  <dig> -fold,  <dig>  fold,  <dig>  fold,  <dig>  fold,  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> -fold of its original reference value respectively. each time, only one of the above parameters was varied with a corresponding fold change, and all other parameters were kept fixed. we chose active cell number  at  <dig> hours in each simulation as the system outcome, and examined the system responses to the above parameter variations. we defined the robustness index  as follows:

  r=acnp−acn0acn <dig>  

where acnp is the active cell number with the varied parameter p, and acn <dig> is the average active cell number from the  <dig> simulations with unvaried reference parameters.

discussion
we developed a multi-scale model by integrating a novel angiogenesis module into an agent-based tumor model based on a set of reaction–diffusion equations that describe the spatio-temporal evolution of the distributions of micro-environmental factors such as glucose, oxygen, tgfα, vegf and fibronectin. these molecular species regulate tumor growth during angiogenesis. each tumor cell is equipped with an egfr signaling pathway linked to a cell-cycle to determine its phenotype.

our simulations show several interesting findings. the first is that tumor cells tend to move towards blood vessels and gradually developed to a fan-shape as shown in figure 5a. we interpret this result as follows. since the nutrients  concentrations are higher at locations near the blood vessels, they attract tumor cells.

the second interesting finding is that blood vessels tend to migrate to tumor and form a dense tree-branching vascular network. the reason is that a high vegf gradient close to the tumor attracts endothelial cells, which in turn lead to branching of vessels in these regions.

the third interesting finding is that tki treatment can inhibit tumor progression. the binding of tki molecules to egfr decreases the amount of effective egfr, which results in low expression of plcγ and low cell’s migration potential . as a result, tumor invasion slows down.

the fourth interesting result is that the tumor cells' survival rate does not always decrease. this is due to the dual role of angiogenesis. newly formed capillaries delivers a substantial amount of tki molecules to tumor cells and blocks the egfr signaling pathway, which lead to an inhibition of tumor growth. this in turn results in a decreased cell survival rate in the early stage of the tumor development. on the other hand, new capillaries transported a lot of glucose and oxygen to tumor cells which results in an increased cell survival rate at later stages . the implications of the dual roles of angiogenesis reveal that clinical personnel should decrease cancer progression by using tki treatment and inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis at the same time.

the sensitivity analysis reveals sensitive parameters in the egfr signaling pathway. the robustness study confirms that our model is relatively robust and stable to fluctuations of these sensitive parameters.

herein we used the two-dimensional in vitro experiments  <cit>  to validate the effectiveness of the model. these experiments employed two-dimensional experimental protocol to isolate and plate human glioma tumor-initiating cells in martrigel-coated culture flasks. figure 5d and figure 7b demonstrate that our in silico model does have strong predictive power and great potential for clinical work.

we are going to extend the model to three dimensions to simulate in vivo tumor growth for real clinical purposes. a three-dimensional lattice is indispensable for the simulation of in vivo tumor growth with angiogenesis, because tumor cells' activities, vasculature structure, and chemical cues' diffusion in three-dimensional heterogeneous tumor growth environment are very different from two-dimensional. moreover, three-dimensional simulations require parallel computing techniques  <cit>  to relieve the heavy computing request.

the potential of our model will further increase, by incorporating more realistic biological and physical features, such as blood flow and tumor growth-induced pressure  <cit>  in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this work presents a novel multi-scale agent-based brain tumor model encompassing an egfr signaling pathway together with a related cell-cycle, an angiogenesis module and tki treatment. it incorporates four relevant biological scales: the molecular scale, the cellular scale, the microenvironment scale and the tissue scale. at the molecular scale, a system of ordinary differential equations simulates the dynamics of the egfr signaling pathway and the cell cycle to determine the cells' phenotypic switch at the cellular scale. we employed a set of partial differential equations to simulate the concentration changes of five extracellular chemical cues  in the tumor micro-environmental scale. angiogenesis was coupled into tumor growth through vegf secreted by the tumor cells and through the glucose and oxygen permeated from the neo-vasculature at the tissue scale. moreover, we integrated tki treatment into egfr signaling pathway to block the activation of egfr.

our simulations demonstrate that the entire tumor growth profile is a collective behaviour of its cells regulated by the egfr signaling pathway and the cell cycle. we also discovered that angiogenesis has dual effects on tki treatment: on one hand, neo-vasculature can deliver tkis to decrease the tumor invasion, whereas on the other hand, it can transport a lot of nutrients  to tumor cells to maintain their metabolism, which results in an increase of cell survival rate at late simulation stage. there is a great similarity between the simulation results and existing in vitro experimental data. further analyses show that our model has strong robustness regarding to the relatively large changes of the sensitive model parameters.
