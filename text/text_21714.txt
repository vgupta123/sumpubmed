BACKGROUND
the cotton family consists of  <dig> diploid species  representing eight genome groups  and five ad allotetraploid species  that are inter-crossable to various degrees. cultivated cotton is an annual fiber crop derived mainly from two perennial species, gossypium hirsutum l. or upland cotton, and g. barbadense l., extra long-staple fiber pima or egyptian cotton. these two cultivated species are among five allotetraploid species presumably derived monophyletically from a single polyploidization event that occurred 1- <dig> mya between ancestors most closely represented today by g. arboreum  and g. raimondii . breeding of cotton is primarily focused on intra-specific crosses to introduce transgenic traits and to improve baseline lint yield and quality  <cit> , although significant advances can be made through inter-specific introgression  <cit> . the relatively recent speciation of tetraploid cotton affords opportunities to transfer novel traits between species, but also amplifies the challenge of maintaining the high yields and quality requisite of commercial products. g. tomentosum  and g. mustelinum  are rich sources of novel traits that are currently being mined to improve cotton agronomy and fiber. dna markers can provide means of detecting, manipulating and identifying genes associated with desirable agronomic and quality traits within breeding programs, as well as novel alleles from wide crosses. they have shown to be useful in accelerating the transfer of novel traits into elite backgrounds, particularly when these markers have been placed on genetic maps  <cit> .

the most extensive genetic maps in cotton have been derived mainly from wide crosses between the two ad-genome species g. hirsutum and g. barbadense  <cit> . inter-specific maps also exist between g. hirsutum and g. tomentosum  <cit> . dna markers have been oriented to chromosomes and used to establish co-linearity among genomes and species using radiation hybrids and hypo-aneuploid f <dig> hybrids, available for most chromosomes. in total, approximately  <dig>  dna markers have been mapped. these were derived from approximately  <dig>  restriction fragment length polymorphisms ,  <dig> amplified fragment length polymorphisms ,  <dig>  simple sequence repeats , and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . furthermore,  <dig>  sequence-tagged site  loci are mapped in an ad genome and  <dig>  in and the d genome  <cit> . an est-ssr map with  <dig>  loci is also available  <cit> . only a few low resolution intra-specific maps that focus on specific traits exist due to the low level of polymorphism within a species and the paucity of cost-efficient markers available to be used in breeding programs.

the vast majority of markers in cotton that are useful in breeding are as ssrs. over  <dig>  pairs of ssr primers are identified in cotton from g. arboreum, g. raimondii and g. hirsutum  <cit> . the frequency of polymorphism within species has been reported to be limited to 11%  <cit> . informative, abundant, high-throughput markers associated with genes such as snps or insertion/deletions  are desirable for both breeding and genetic analyses. expressed genes are available as templates to study variation. in, g. arboreum,  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts are available; with  <dig>  in g. raimondii; and  <dig>  in g. hirsutum  <cit> . the goal of the current project was to design a strategy to efficiently identify and characterize snp markers that are useful to manipulate and transfer novel alleles to breeding germplasm in cotton. different dna templates were evaluated for their specificity to amplify single-copy loci, and polymorphism within and among species, with emphasis on cultivated cotton. we show that single-copy loci can be efficiently amplified in cotton despite redundancy conferred by its allopolyploid origin, and that they can be mapped to specific genomes. the information can be queried in the cotton marker database which has been modified for presentation of snp data  <cit> 

RESULTS
defining optimum regions to sample for snps in cotton
our goal was to define and optimize a snp discovery strategy in cotton that exploits current genomic resources. the disomic polyploid nature of cotton poses a particular challenge in that most loci are duplicated, and breeding germplasm is derived from a relatively narrow genetic base  <cit> . a re-sequencing strategy developed by our lab was modified to anchor and screen dna primer pairs that amplify single-copy, polymorphic regions of the genome relevant to current breeding germplasm that can also be used for introgression of novel alleles from exotic germplasm . to address this, we empirically evaluated the proportion of single-copy sequences obtained from amplicons originating from different genomic regions, namely: bac-end sequences, sequences flanking ssrs or predicted introns in ests, and sequences in the 3' or 5' untranslated region of ests . although the majority  of amplifiable primer sets showed single bands on agarose gels, sscp analysis revealed that only 51% and 40% of the primer pairs amplified single-copy sequences in g. arboreum and g. hirsutum, respectively. with sscp analysis of single varieties, an amplicon from a single-copy locus in homozygous state, whether from a diploid or tetraploid is expected to display only two bands, one from sense and one anti-sense strands. as the lines being assayed were near-homozygous, only loci with two sscp bands were carried forward.

the amplicon templates exhibited a range of amplification, copy number and polymorphism . the low rate of amplification  achieved when primers were designed from bac-end genomic sequence deterred us from using this as template for primer design. the relatively poor rate of success might have resulted from inadequate quality of bac-end genomic sequence available at the time . cotton genome-specific  amplicons, those derived from primers spanning a snp between g. arboreum and g. raimondii, resulted in the highest percentage  of single-copy sequences . primer pairs neighboring genomic ssrs also resulted in a high percentage  of single-copy sequences, but the relatively small amount of sequence flanking each ssr, 150- <dig> bp, limited the number of nucleotides available within an amplicon for snp discovery. amplicons that encompass introns or are derived from a conserved orthologous set  of sequences that are single copy in arabidopsis and cotton ests showed excellent amplification. however, as their primers are anchored in coding regions, they are likely to be the most conserved across paralogs, as indicated by the relatively low proportion  of single-copy sequences. the 5' utr of ests are the most abundant in the est dataset and resulted in the highest proportion of amplicons with single-copy loci overall , next to the gsps that became available only late in the project. it is important to note that the ests used were created by capturing sequences from the 3' utr and sequencing from either the 3' or 5' end. consequently, the 5' sequences may not necessarily represent the 5' terminus of genes if clones were not full length. as a comparison, chee et al.  used sequences from g. arboreum to amplify g. hirsutum  <cit> . the authors reported that 33%  of primer pairs yielded amplicons from single-copy loci, which is similar to the current results . this indicates the high level of homology of exons between homoeologous genomes in tetraploid cotton. the results of this study indicate that although genomic regions harbor genetic diversity, strategies must be developed to ensure that allelic diversity and not diversity between homoeologs and paralogs are being assayed.

diversity of genomic regions
to study the diversity of cotton, we tested different dna templates to select the optimum regions that will yield single-copy, yet polymorphic amplicons from pcr. of the  <dig>  primer pairs designed, 8% were from the 3' end; 50% 5'end; 29% cos; 6% intron; 3% ssr; 2% genome-specific primers; and 1% genomic  primers. eighty-one percent successfully amplified dna in a single g. arboreum and g. hirsutum line and 47% produced single-copy amplicons based on sscp gels . the relatively high amplification rate across species from primers designed mainly from diploid species confirms the transferability of markers across species as indicated in previous studies  <cit> . to pre-screen primer pairs for polymorphism, dna pools representing increasing diversity within g. hirsutum and g. barbadense germplasm and among these two species were amplified and sequenced. pool  <dig> represents g. hirsutum; pool  <dig>  g. hirsutum/g. hirsutum race yucatenense; and pool  <dig>  g. hirsutum and g. barbadense . polymorphism within pools was identified as heterozygotes, whereas polymorphism among pools was identified as differences in homozygous alleles. polymorphic loci were then sequenced individually in the forward and reverse directions in  <dig> lines . forty-nine percent of primers with single-copy loci were polymorphic within or among pools. overall, the pools represent the two cultivated species in the united states, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, which explains the high polymorphism  and snp frequency  compared to within species polymorphism . the sscp pre-screening and pooling strategy saved 77% of the resources compared to direct sequencing of individuals with  <dig> amplifiable primers .

1thirty-four single-copy loci were sequenced without pre-screening in pools.

only amplicons showing polymorphism in pools were sequenced in individual lines. the germplasm panel included  <dig> g. hirsutum and three g. barbadense genotypes, plus tetraploids g. mustelinum and g. tomentosum and diploids g. arboreum and g. raimondii . sequencing of dna templates resulted in different frequencies of snps and indels . sequences from 3' utrs , and ssr-associated  sequences yielded 2- <dig> fold the frequency of snps than 5'ends, cos, gsp and introns . it is important to note that cos and gsp sequences contained introns. similarly the frequency of indels was least in 5' end sequences and greatest in 3' utrs . these results are consistent with those in maize showing that 3' utrs are a rich source of nucleotide diversity  <cit> . the lowest diversity in the 5'ends is consistent with representation of more highly conserved coding sequences  <cit>  . in comparison, the vacuolar h+-atpase subunit  <cit>  and myb transcription factor families  <cit>  were examined for diversity in diploid and tetraploid cotton species. the, 3' utrs were 10-fold more polymorphic than coding sequences for myb transcription factors  <cit> .

alternatively, designing primers from conserved single-copy sequences , or genome-specific primers  is an efficient method to access variation in introns for single loci in cotton. a closer examination at the different strategies indicates that gsp-based primers are less likely to amplify informative products than cos , but more likely to target single-locus sequences when they do . the majority of the cos sequences in our dataset were derived from diploid progenitors . a cos-derived from tetraploid cotton only is likely to yield a larger proportion of single-copy loci in tetraploids., cotton intron regions were found to be less conserved than exons in the h+-atpase subunit family  <cit> . intron sequences have shown to be  <dig> -fold more polymorphic than exons in cotton  <cit> . cos-based amplicons have also yielded a very high proportion of single-copy sequences  in solanaceae  <cit> .

another template target is to use predicted snps between diploid progenitor species to anchor primers to specific genomes . yang et al.  <cit>  predicted  <dig>  genome-specific snps from est databases with 31% showing perfect concordance to the a or d genomes in the genotypes examined. in the current study,  <dig>  snps were identified between only the diploid species and not within the tetraploid species . as we sampled introns, many of these would be novel to est-mined snps. only  <dig> snps between g. arboreum and g. raimondii  are polymorphic in g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. in our study, the estimates of diversity within and among species may not be representative of other species than g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, as only sequences that were polymorphic within and among these species were characterized. to ensure that single copy loci were being assayed, only snps that had clear homozygotes in at least one tetraploid were called.

diversity of cotton germplasm
within species diversity
snps were recorded as a base substitution relative to the consensus sequence derived from all genotypes. although the number of individuals sampled varied, the species-specific diversity  was similar with two-fold lower frequency of snps for g. arboreum and g. hirsutum than the other species tested . g. barbadense showed the highest level of diversity of the species tested with  <dig> snp per  <dig> bases and 28% of its loci being polymorphic. conversely, g. hirsutum has the highest frequency of indels and the diploid progenitor species the least . the average frequency of snps among  <dig> g. hirsutum lines was 1/ <dig> bp . in adh genes, within g. hirsutum and g. barbadense diversity ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> snps in  <dig> bases   <cit> . with the few reports of snp frequencies in cotton, within g. hirsutum , snp frequency ranged from 0/ <dig>  bp  <cit> , 1/ <dig>  bp   <cit>  to 1/ <dig> bp   <cit>  in adh, myb and expansin genes, respectively. estimates of snp divergence within and among species in the referenced studies were greater than those reported in our study for over  <dig>  loci.

among species diversity
snp diversity in cotton has a large range that is both genome and gene specific. compared to g. hirsutum, snp frequency in g. arboreum, g. barbadense, g. mustelinum, g. tomentosum and g. raimondii ranged from 1/ <dig>  bp  to 1/ <dig>  bp/snp  in order of increasing divergence . estimates among these species ranged from 1/ <dig> bp per snp  in myb and expansin genes between g. raimondii and g. hirsutum  <cit>  to 1/ <dig> bp per snp  between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense in r2r <dig> myb transcription factors  <cit> . the discrepancy in estimates is likely due to gene-specific estimates, number of genes, germplasm used and the regions of the genes being sampled . non-coding sequence was reported to be 2- <dig> fold more polymorphic than coding regions  <cit> .

comparisons of tetraploid species with g. raimondii  were consistently more divergent than those with g. arboreum  except for g. mustelinum . this agrees with observations using ssrs. est-derived ssrs from diploid species tended to map more often to their orthologous genomes in corresponding tetraploid species  <cit> , with g. raimondii-derived ssrs  being more polymorphic than g. arboreum derived ssrs  in the same cross  <cit> . furthermore, in comparisons between a-genome diploids, a d-genome diploid, and tetraploids , the rate of divergence in  <dig> genes was significantly higher in d-genomes than a-genomes, although the rate of divergence was gene-specific  <cit> . this was verified for specific gene families of transcription factors, adh and expansins  <cit>  in cotton.

several methods have been proposed for snp discovery in allopolyploids and highly duplicated genomes including in silico analysis  <cit> , genome specific-pcr  <cit> , cloning and sequencing  <cit> . we have evaluated genome-specific amplification and high-throughput direct sequencing using m13-tailed amplicons combined with targeted primer design and pre-screening of primer pairs. we show that several options are feasible for high-throughput snp discovery in cotton, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. the current research agrees with current literature that although tetraploid cottons were derived from a single polyploidization event from their diploid progenitors only 1- <dig> mya  <cit> , the genomes remain distinct and have sufficient diversity for breeding.

linkage mapping
snps were evaluated as markers by designing a 384-snp array for the illumina golden gate assay®. of the  <dig> snps on the array,  <dig> putative snps representing  <dig> contigs were expected to be polymorphic between the parents of our mapping population, tm- <dig>  and 3- <dig>  and validated by assessing their segregation and amenability to linkage mapping. of the  <dig> expected parental snps,  <dig> polymorphisms were detected using the illumina assays on a population of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines   <cit> . segregation was as expected  for  <dig> markers, whereas  <dig> had skewed segregation resulting in  <dig> snps being placed on the linkage map . markers that were not mapped had missing data or skewed segregation. the snp markers are added to the tm-1/3- <dig> base map  providing new tools for high-throughput genotyping in cotton. the snp data are thus cross-referenced to several genetic  <cit>  and physical maps  <cit>  via common ssrs . all snps, indels and flanking sequences can be accessed through the cmd database <cit> .

although markers were evenly distributed within linkage groups, there was a disproportionate number of markers on linkage groups in the a subgenome  vs. the d subgenome . at least 70% of the primers including those designed from 3'-end, 5'-end, intron and gsp, were derived exclusively from g. arboreum sequences, whereas the remainder were from g. arboreum, g. hirsutum and g. raimondii assemblies . the fact that the majority of loci were derived from g. arboreum sequences and that these loci were in turn mapped to a-subgenome chromosomes in the tm- <dig> × 3- <dig> cross suggests that a) our approach for identifying single-locus markers was very effective; b) there is strong sequence conservation between the a <dig> genome of g. arboreum, and the a subgenomes of g. hirsutum  and g. barbadense , c) the a and d subgenomes of contemporary ad genomes are distinct from each other; and d) the a subgenomes of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense are moderately divergent. the above conclusions are emphasized in the present study first by amplifying and sequencing single-copy loci and being able to assay the same sequences using an independent assay, illumina golden gate. because our template sequences were primarily drawn from g. arboreum and selected for both pcr function and single-locus attributes using sscp, it is quite possible that the populations of selected loci in the two subgenomes would have been differentially affected. the potential for bias across the two subgenomes precludes using these amplicon sequence or genotyping data to infer relative diversity of the a versus d subgenomes of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. our findings are not discordant with the theory that these two extant tetraploids originated from a common allopolyploid ancestor and have evolved independently long enough to create the detected variation and a significant degree of diploidization.

the use of snps in cotton
snp diversity depends on population size sampled and the natural evolutionary and directed selection within those populations. the present study indicates that a moderate amount of variation associated with genes exists in breeding germplasm  at the nucleotide level. g. barbadense germplasm sampled was  <dig>  times as diverse  as g. hirsutum even though less than one fifth as many g. barbadense lines were sampled. the a and d genomes of tetraploid cotton are significantly divergent such that individual snp loci can be assayed with high specificity. although the above strategy for snp identification and validation was fruitful, new high-throughput sequencing technologies such as  <dig>  illumina genome analyzer  and solid  offer an opportunity to complement the current strategy to rapidly uncover nucleotide diversity at the whole genome level in multiple breeding lines. the present study demonstrates that sufficient snp diversity exists in tetraploid cotton populations for genetic and breeding studies and it can be efficiently assayed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this research, snp and indel diversity is characterized for  <dig> single-copy polymorphic loci in cotton. a strategy for snp discovery is described to pre-screen loci for copy number and polymorphism. diversity was characterized in a broad set of breeding lines and exotic lines representing a standard germplasm panel indicating that g. barbadense is much more diverse than g. hirsutum. our data also indicate that the a and d genomes in both diploid and tetraploid cotton remain distinct from each other such that homoeologs can be distinguished. all marker data and flanking sequences have been submitted to cotton marker database
