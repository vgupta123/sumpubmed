BACKGROUND
it is well known that dna methylation plays a repressive role in gene transcription, both in heterochromatin and in repressed, protein-coding, euchromatin  <cit> . recent work demonstrated that dna methylation cooperates with histone modifications to perform this repressive function  <cit> . acetylation and methylation on histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  are two of the best studied modifications. acetyl-h3k <dig> is known to be associated with active transcription, and methyl-h3k <dig> with repressed transcription  <cit> . to better understand the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, it is necessary to clarify the crosstalk, including the distribution patterns, between these epigenetic markers  <cit> . some reports showed the physical interaction between histone deacetylase and histone methyltransferase  <cit> . meanwhile, removal of acetylation has been shown to be a necessary step for histone methyltransferase activity  <cit> . it is believed that histone acetylation and histone methylation act in concert to regulate gene transcription. studies in fungi and plant, and, to a lesser degree, in mammals indicate that methyl-h3k <dig> may control dna methylation in heterochromatin  <cit> . current knowledge also supports the idea that repressive complexes, containing both methyl binding domain  proteins and histone deacetylases , in combination with other repressor proteins, direct dna methylation and subsequently transcriptional repression  <cit> . additional evidence shows that dna methylation impacts histone methylation and that dna methylation might exert a positive feedback on lysine methylation  <cit> . to reconcile these two seemingly distinct mechanisms, a self-enforcing network of epigenetic regulation has been proposed: histone methylation impacts dna methylation and histone acetylation which in turn impacts histone methylation  <cit> .

the current self-enforcing model implies close correlation of histone modifications and dna methylation, especially the crosstalk between methyl-h3k <dig> and dna methylation  <cit> . however, recent reports demonstrated that these epigenetic markers have varying degrees of autonomy  <cit> . for example in arabidopsis, trichostatin a , a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and 5'-aza-2-deoxycytidine , a demethylating agent, do not always produce redundant outcomes. most surprisingly, they may even demonstrate antagonistic effects as opposed to the expected synergistic effects  <cit> . in arabidopsis, where dna methylation is not crucial for survival, methyl-h3k <dig> marks heterochromatin independent of dna methylation  <cit> . in mammals, no close association between methyl-h3k <dig> and dna methylation was discovered for: imprinted gene loci on distal chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , the inactive x chromosome in icf and rett syndrome cells  <cit> , fmr <dig> in fragile x syndrome  <cit> , or mgmt, lhr in human cancers  <cit> .

here we analyze profiles of dna methylation and histone modifications in a mouse leukemia genome to better understand the relationship between these epigenetic events. using genome-wide data, we demonstrate that histone acetylation and histone methylation show a distinct degree of autonomy with respect to promoter methylation.

RESULTS
global profiling of acety-h3k <dig>  dimethyl-h3k <dig>  and dna methylation in l <dig> cells
we first performed chromatin chip-chip on the mouse leukemia cell line, l <dig>  with antibodies detecting either acetyl-h3k <dig> or dimethyl-h3k <dig>  chip products were hybridized onto the mouse  <dig> k cpg island microarray. immunoprecipitated dnas from acetyl- or dimethyl-h3k <dig> chips were compared individually with total genomic dna input. increased hybridization signals indicated an enrichment of a specific histone modification for a given cpg island locus . the scatter plot, with fold changes plotted against geometric mean of signal intensities, showed that the relative level of acetyl-h3k <dig> has a wider range of distribution than the intensity index seen for dimethyl-h3k <dig> .

next, dmh was performed using the mouse cpg island microarray. because l <dig> originated from the mouse strain dba <dig>  we used genomic dna derived from this mouse strain as a control for assessing dna methylation in l <dig>  the dmh assay was used to evaluate the methylation status of bstui and hpaii sites, located within or nearby cpg islands. a 2-fold increased intensity was used as a cutoff for scoring positive loci for dna methylation  <cit> . those loci scoring positive  in dmh and/or chip-chip data were then used to compare the acety-h3k <dig> and dimethyl-h3k <dig> levels against their promoter methylation level . overall, we observed a trend that high levels of acetyl-h3k <dig>  were preferentially present in unmethylated cpg islands while acetylation levels less than 2-fold are correlated with hypermethylated loci in l <dig> . however, the distribution pattern of dimethyl-h3k <dig> against dna methylation status was not as distinct as that of acetyl-h3k <dig> in this cell line .

subpanel profiling of acety-h3k <dig>  dimethyl-h3k <dig>  and dna methylation in l <dig> cells
to independently confirm these genome-wide findings, we focused the epigenetic analysis to a subset of promoter cpg islands. we first used the restriction landmark genome scanning  technique to identify hypermethylated loci in l <dig> compared to the control dba <dig>  loss of cpg island sequences in rlgs indicates potential noti hypermethylation present in this leukemia cell line   <cit> . of the  <dig> sites screened, we identified a total of  <dig>  rlgs fragment losses. the identified dna methylation pattern of l <dig> was similar to profiles obtained from the leukemia samples derived from a mouse model of nk/t acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with numerous commonly methylated sequences   <cit> .

we then used a subset of  <dig>  promoter cpg islands identified in rlgs to establish a custom mouse promoter array for chip-chip assays. the 5' fragments of these targets, including their transcription start site or noti restriction site, were amplified by pcr and printed on glass slides . immunoprecipitated dnas from l <dig> using antibodies against acetyl- or dimethyl-h3k <dig> were then used to hybridize this custom microarray panel. the results showed that the level of acetyl-h3k <dig> had a wider range of distribution than that of dimethyl-h3k <dig> . similar to the results obtained from the global microarray, the dimethyl-h3k <dig> level of these  <dig> loci was not as high as expected even though most of the targets were methylated in l <dig>  to clarify the relationship between histone modifications and dna methylation, we plotted the distribution patterns of histone acetylation or methylation versus dna methylation in these  <dig> loci . consistent with the previous reports  <cit> , this interval plot analysis showed that acety-h3k <dig> was reversely correlated with dna methylation . however, dimethyl-h3k <dig> and dna were not found to be significantly correlated. altogether, the results confirmed the aforementioned genome-wide findings that acetyl-h3k <dig> and dimethyl-h3k <dig> may have distinct autonomies with respect to dna methylation in this subpanel of loci in l <dig> cells.

confirmation of acety-h3k <dig>  dimethyl-h3k <dig>  and dna methylation profiles in individual cpg island loci
to further confirm the dna methylation status and histone modifications in individual genes, combined bisulfite restriction analysis  and chip-pcr were performed on  <dig> genes chosen from the subpanel list . two known genes, p19arf and id <dig>  were used as unmethylated and methylated controls, respectively  <cit> . of these selected genes, six were deemed active, while the rest were inactive, according to their associated epigenetic marks . of the  <dig> targets examined, the methylation status of  <dig> genes was confirmed in l <dig> cells . two genes , found to be methylated by rlgs , were not confirmed by cobra, which may be caused by different restriction enzymes used in these two methods. the cobra data showed an "all or nothing" methylation status in the promoters of targets examined. in the tested sites of these promoters, there seems to be no partial methylation detected by cobra, which facilitates our further analysis.

chip, followed by real-time pcr, was applied to evaluate both acetyl- and dimethyl-h3k <dig> enrichment in the promoter regions of these targets. the enrichment levels of these  <dig> loci were compared between chip-dna and genomic dna . eleven of the  <dig> loci showed the same trend of histone modifications as derived by chip-chip assays . in this regard, the acetyl-h3k <dig> level was inversely correlated with the dna methylation status. not surprisingly, the dimethyl-h3k <dig> level showed no significant difference with respect to the dna methylation status of these loci, suggesting that the acquisition of dimethyl-h3k <dig> is less dependent on dna methylation in the protein-coding genes than acetyl-h3k <dig>  meanwhile, the overall enrichment of acetyl-h3k <dig> varied greatly, but dimethy-h3k <dig> varied to a lesser extent, which is consistent with our chip-chip data. the results of the two control genes, p19arf and id <dig>  are consistent with our other data .

the chromatin landscape of the promoter regions  in two genes, ran and zic <dig>  was analyzed in greater detailed by chip-pcr. twelve sets of primers were used in chip-pcr to cover their promoter regions from - <dig>  to  <dig> -kb away from the respective transcription start sites. the overall levels of acetyl-h3k <dig> were lower than those of dimethyl-h3k <dig> in the promoter region of the inactive zic <dig> gene, but significantly increased in the active ran gene in l <dig> cells . in contrast, dimethyl-h3k <dig> levels were only slightly higher than those of acetyl-h3k <dig> in most parts of the interrogating regions, except in some regions of the active ran promoter. the highest level of dimethyl-h3k <dig> was found in transcribed regions but not in the promoter of repressed genes.

the effects of trichostatin a  and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine  on gene re-expression
four genes were studied following treatment with tsa, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and azadc, a dna methyltransferase inhibitor. the expression of four selected genes, tjp <dig>  zic <dig>  ran and cog <dig>  were examined under different dosage of treatments for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days. zic <dig> and tjp <dig> were associated with repressive epigenetic markers , and their transcription in l <dig> could not be detected with quantitative rt-pcr prior to drug treatment . azadc alone was able to de-repress tjp <dig>  but not zic <dig>  tsa alone did not reactivate tjp <dig> or zic <dig>  however, a combination of tsa and azadc was able to activate the expression of zic <dig>  and showed a synergetic effect. for tjp <dig>  the addition of tsa, however, had no or little additional effect on transcription, and its re-expression was due to azadc treatment. even though histone acetylation and dna methylation were closely correlated for both tjp <dig> and zic <dig>  these two epigenetic markers may affect gene function to differing extents. these results are also consistent with previous reports that dna methylation is a dominant repressive factor, and that tsa alone may not de-repress gene transcription if the gene is densely methylated  <cit> . two genes, ran and cog <dig>  were expressed in l <dig> and not methylated in their promoters . the expression of ran was increased under low concentrations  of azadc at day  <dig>  however, both ran and cog <dig> showed reduced expression to varying degrees following prolonged treatments  of azadc and/or tsa .

discussion
the relationship between histone modifications and dna methylation in maintaining gene silencing has been studied at the chromosomal level  <cit> . the model shows that a cooperation between methyl-h3k <dig> and dna methylation is found in heterochromatin regions and major satellite repeats  <cit> . in euchromatic regions or at the individual gene level, controversial results have been reported in regards to the distribution and function of histone methylation in mammals  <cit> .

using genome-wide profiling techniques in l <dig> leukemia cells, our present study shows distinct levels of autonomy in histone modifications in relation to dna methylation of multiple protein-coding genes. specifically, we demonstrate an inverse relationship between dna methylation and histone acetylation in regulating transcription of these genes in mouse leukemia cells. however, methyl-h3k <dig> seems to be ambiguous in specifying silencing of some genes tested. our findings might not fit into the model that histone methylation and dna methylation are closely corollated in maintaining the repressive state of genes  <cit> . it should be noted that the establishment of this prior model is solely based on the observation of a few genes  <cit> . the present findings, however, are based on genome-wide profiling of these epigenetic components in multiple genes. here we would like to propose an alternative model, in which histone methylation is distributed throughout the whole genome, including transcribed regions, and can be reversed by histone demethylase. however, dna methylation is the final repressive lock, which can not be easily removed. in the "context" of stabilized chromatin, regions of histone acetylation "islands" are used to keep the active conformation at specific positions.

in addition to the above explanation, one additional suggestion is that the promoter region of protein-coding genes is not the prime target for this histone modification . recent discoveries have shown that the mouse promoter regions of hemoglobin beta adult major chain and gata- <dig> have lower levels of both di- and tri-methylation of h3k <dig> than those in major satellite repeats and transcribed regions  <cit> . it is possible that regulatory mechanisms of histone methylation of h3k <dig>  especially its crosstalk with dna methylation, are different depending on chromatin locations and other unknown factors.

our data shows the diverse status of histone modifications in relation to dna methylation in mouse leukemia cells, providing new clues to the understanding of epigenetic regulation in mouse genome. in this regard, epigenetic components that specify active or inactive chromatin play different roles, but are cooperative, under different circumstances during mammalian development. crosstalk between h3k <dig> methylation and dna methylation are evolutionarily conserved from fungi to plants to mammals  <cit> . while genetic studies have shown that while h3k <dig> methylation is completely responsible for establishing dna methylation in heterochromatic regions of neurospora, this correlation is only partially established in arabidopsis  <cit> . meanwhile, some reports have shown that the distribution of histone methylation is dependent on dna methylation in plants, but not in fungi  <cit> . in mouse embryonic stem cells lacking dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a or dnmt3b, no trimethyl-h3k <dig> redistribution is observed  <cit> . in double-null mouse es cells for suv39h, a histone methyltransferase, dna methylation profiles are only changed in pericentric satellite repeats, but not in other repeat sequences  <cit> . another histone methyltransferase, g9a, specifically affects imprinted genes depending on the development of embryonic stages  <cit> . other gene studies have also produced controversial results between the correlation of histone modifications and dna methylation  <cit> . from these studies, it is obvious that epigenetic redundancy, resulting from complex interactions among different chromatin components, is implemented to safeguard the stability of repressed chromatin structure.

possible "heterogeneity" of epigenetic regulation is also revealed by our tsa/azadc treatment study. repressive epigenetic marks may be different in the  <dig> genes analyzed, as the same drug treatment produced differential effects of expression in these loci. meanwhile, alternative pathways may exist for tsa or azadc that affect their upstream regulators genes, which also regulate the expression of these genes.

here we need to keep in mind that only dimethylation of h3k <dig> was examined in this study, and further investigation is essential to delineate the relation of mono- and trimethyl-h3k <dig> methylation to dna methylation. it is known that in mouse, different types of methylation at h3k <dig> are distributed with various patterns in chromatin  <cit> . for example, trimethyl-h3k <dig> is over abundant in heterochromatin, whereas mono- and dimethyl-h3k <dig> are predominantly in euchromatin. since we were more interested in the epigenetic modifications in euchromatin, dimethyl-h3k <dig> was selected in this study. both mono- and trimethyl-h3k <dig> methylation deserve further study so that "heterogeneity" of epigenetic regulation can be well understood. we selected a single mouse leukemia cell line, l <dig>  in this study and conclusions drawn in this system will need to be validated in other mammalian cells.

chip-chip, rlgs, and dmh are genome-wide techniques, which can be readily applied to epigenomic studies. cpg island arrays have been widely used in human epigenetic studies  <cit> . however, very little work has been done combining mouse cpg island arrays with other epigenomic tools. current knowledge of crosstalk between histone modifications and dna methylation comes mainly from a series of experimental strategies, including complex interaction, genetic studies and sequence characterization  <cit> . in addition, one main direction is to delineate specific epigenetic marks that implicate cellular functions, such as cell-lineage determination and stem cell differentiation. these challenges require epigenomic tools, as those described in this study and two recent reviews  <cit> . studies have described the use of chip-chip to investigate the correlation between histone modifications and gene transcription from yeast to human  <cit> . because of technical limitations, few epigenomic tools have been reported in the mouse. the implementation of cpg island and custom microarrays makes it possible to interrogate complex epigenetic networks in mammalian systems.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed integrative epigenomic studies and found a diverse relationship between histone modifications and dna methylation for the maintenance of gene silencing. acetyl-h3k <dig> appears to have an inverse relationship with promoter methylation in protein-coding genes. in contrast, methyl-h3k <dig> seems to be less distinctly related to promoter methylation. this work also demonstrates the importance of using genome-wide approaches to decipher complex epigenetic regulation in the cell.
