BACKGROUND
the molecular basis of drug resistance in malaria parasites and its evolution in time and space can be investigated, and possibly controlled, once the genes and specific mutations involved have been identified. however, despite intense investigations of human malaria parasites, few mutations have been unambiguously linked to drug resistance phenotypes. the most direct evidence for novel genetic markers comes from classical genetic studies that require no prior knowledge regarding mode of action or resistance  <cit> . for example, linkage analysis of a genetic cross in plasmodium falciparum identified the locus containing pfcrt  <cit> , the determinant of chloroquine resistance. this facilitated the characterisation of selective sweeps  <cit>  driven by the world-wide use of chloroquine, and generated insights into the molecular basis of resistance  <cit> . genetic studies have been extended to consider smaller gene effects, such as those underlying quinine susceptibility, by quantitative trait loci analysis  <cit> . however, there are experimental and ethical factors that constrain the use of p. falciparum for genetic studies. for example, it has sometimes proved difficult to generate drug-resistant p. falciparum mutant clones in vitro  <cit>  and in these cases it has been necessary to await the appearance of resistant parasites in field samples. also, although three genetic crosses between p. falciparum parasites have been performed and analysed  <cit>  for genes involved in drug resistance or erythrocyte invasion, these require primate hosts and are therefore expensive and demand stringent ethical approval. fortunately, the experimental tractability of the rodent malaria p. chabaudi presents a number of advantages, as follows.

experimental evolution of the rodent malaria p. chabaudi  <cit>  previously produced an isogenic lineage comprising several genetically stable drug resistant clones, genetically related to a drug-sensitive clone , by the repeated in vivo passage of parasites in the presence of increasing but sub-curative doses of the drugs pyrimethamine, chloroquine, mefloquine and artemisinin derivatives  <cit> . in general, the sequence of drug resistance in this lineage reflects the historical pattern of selection of human malaria parasites by drug prophylaxis and treatment. comparisons between wild-type and isogenic mutant parasites are especially informative: direct associations  can be observed in the absence of additional genetic diversity.

in order to map genes conferring selectable phenotypes, p. chabaudi has also been used to develop linkage group selection   <cit> , where recombinant parasites from genetic crosses are analysed en masse; i.e. without the need to investigate the genotypes and phenotypes of individually cloned recombinant parasites. lgs scans the genome for 'selection valleys'; regions of selection where the proportion of alleles from a drug-sensitive parent are reduced in the uncloned drug-treated progeny of a genetic cross, relative to those in an untreated population. this approach has been used to map genes underlying pyrimethamine resistance  <cit>  and strain-specific immunity  <cit>  in p. chabaudi, and growth rate in p. yoelii  <cit> .

now, the advent of next-generation sequencing technology  <cit>  makes possible whole-genome re-sequencing of mutant clones  <cit> . because an annotated p. chabaudi as-sens whole-genome assembly has recently been made available  <cit> , a comprehensive whole genome re-sequencing of clones of the as-lineage  will define all of the genetic variation arising within the lineage, identify mutations in selection valleys and, thereby, advance our understanding of the relationships between genetic mutation, drug response and selection.

this paper integrates these evolutionary, genetic and genomic approaches to specify the specific mutation underlying in vivo resistance to artemisinin. we demonstrate the evolution of artemisinin resistance in the p. chabaudi as lineage, use lgs to map an underlying gene in two independent genetic crosses and re-sequence the complete genomes of the wild-type as parasite and two artemisinin resistant mutants. we conclude that a single point mutation in the gene ubp <dig>  encoding a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, confers artemisinin resistance in this p. chabaudi lineage.

RESULTS
experimental evolution of artemisinin resistance in p. chabaudi
the strategy presented here exploits a comprehensive lineage of genetically related parasites , comprising drug-resistant mutants previously generated  <cit>  by the sequential passage of parasites in mice treated with individual drugs  and the intermittent fixation of mutations by cloning. we determined the artemisinin responses of the genetically distinct cloned isolate aj, and seven clones of the as lineage when grown in vivo in mice . as-sens, as-pyr <dig>  as-3cq and aj all failed to establish detectable parasitaemias after art treatment  whereas as-30cq, as-15mf, and as-art gave detectable parasitaemias on day  <dig> or  <dig> post infection and peak parasitaemias of about 20% at some point between days  <dig> to  <dig>  as-atn gave detectable parasitaemias on day  <dig>  peaking at 10% during days  <dig> to  <dig>  aj, as-sens, as-pyr- <dig> and as-3cq were deemed artemisinin-sensitive because no parasites were detected at any time during post-treatment follow-up. conversely, because artemisinin treatment failed for as-30cq, as-15mf, as-art and as-atn, these parasites were classified as artemisinin-resistant. it was therefore predicted that mutations conferring artemisinin resistance were selected between as-3cq and as-30cq, as-atn or as-15mf; interestingly, before parasites were ever exposed to artemisinin derivatives. as-30cq parasites had only been exposed to pyrimethamine and chloroquine, while as-15mf had also been exposed to mefloquine. these data suggest that the gene mutations underlying artemisinin resistance may have pleiotropic effects. for example they may affect responses to other drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine.

whole-genome genetic analysis of artemisinin resistance
in order to map the genetic loci underlying artemisinin resistance, we analysed genetic crosses between either as-30cq   and the genetically distinct drug-sensitive cloned isolate aj, using lgs. the uncloned progeny of a genetic backcross  between as-30cq and aj  were treated with artemisinin . a genome-wide library of ~ <dig> pyrosequencing assays  <cit>  was then used to measure the proportions of aj and as alleles  at pre-mapped loci dispersed across the genome  in both the drug-treated and the untreated populations. a single dominant selection valley was obtained on chr <dig> . for instance, the aj allele of the pcpf01- <dig> marker here was reduced from  <dig> % in the untreated population to  <dig> % in the drug-treated population as shown in a detailed profile of selection on chr <dig> . except for loci on chr <dig>  the proportions of aj alleles of most markers in both the selected and unselected populations of parasites were generally high, possibly reflecting the predominance of aj alleles in the backcross, the small proportion of parental aj genotypes  and/or the existence of many aj loci contributing small fitness effects in this experimental system. factors such as these render the selection of as alleles on chr <dig> even more striking.

because apparent genetic associations can arise by chance, we used two statistical approaches to test the significance of this selection valley . firstly, the deepest selection valley from each of  <dig> simulations  of the experimental design were used to estimate the probability  that the depth of an observed selection valley was the result of random processes working in combination with selection at minor loci for resistance . secondly, the non-parametric mann-whitney u-test was used to evaluate the probability that the allele frequency observed under drugs is significantly different from the random scatter of allele frequencies observed in the absence of drugs. the stringency of the statistical analysis was increased incrementally by reducing the aj allele frequencies  in untreated parasites . even so, the mann-whitney u-test underestimates the significance of the chr <dig> selection valley because the selection valley extended beyond the  <dig> consecutive loci used to compute significance . also, chr <dig> was the most dominant selection valley when a different genetic cross  was selected with  <dig> mg kg- <dig> art  and the profile of selection on chr <dig> was similar to that of the as-30cq × aj cross . in this case, the aj frequency of marker pcpf01- <dig> was reduced from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

whole genome re-sequencing of art resistant parasites
the dominant chr <dig> selection valley indicates that both as-15mf and as-30cq bear a mutation conferring artemisinin resistance in this locus. previously, a mutation ) in a ubiquitin-specific protease  gene  on chr <dig> was proposed to be linked to artemisinin resistance  <cit>  but the presence of other mutations in this locus was not investigated. here therefore, the illumina® solexa platform  <cit>  was used to define a comprehensive inventory of mutations arising within the p. chabaudi drug-resistant lineage  and specifically, to determine the presence of other mutations on chr <dig>  we sequenced the drug-sensitive clone as-sens and the resistant clones as-15mf and as-30cq .  <dig> -  <dig> base single reads were aligned to the complete and annotated as-sens reference genome sequence   <cit>  using maq  <cit>  and ssaha <dig>  <cit>  mapping software packages, producing mean -fold coverage of ~  <dig> , ~ <dig>  or ~ <dig> . as-wtsi comprises the majority of the genome assembled into  <dig> chromosomes, plus a small amount of sequence in contigs not assigned to any chromosome. the assigned chromosomal data contains all of the genes that have orthologues in p. falciparum  plus some p. chabaudi- and rodent-specific genes and expanded gene families primarily located at sub-telomeric ends of assembled chromosomes. candidate snps in as-sens, as-30cq or as-15mf relative to the as-wtsi reference sequence were automatically called by maq and ssaha <dig> algorithms. this process filters out unreliable, poor quality snp calls on the basis of their associated quality indices and properties . lineage-specific candidate mutations were then identified by 'filtering out' snps specified for as-30cq  with those also called for as-sens. because artemisinin resistance arises after as-3cq, here we identify only those mutations that are present in both as-30cq and as-15mf. this set of shared mutations will include those conferring resistance to artemisinin, as well as those conferring resistance to pyrimethamine and chloroquine.

maq and ssaha <dig> analysis revealed only four shared point mutations, located on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> . their positions relative to the chr <dig> selection valley are shown in the genome-wide genetic scan of artemisinin selected progeny . three of the four point mutations  are missense mutations in genes with known orthologues in other plasmodium spp. the remaining point mutation is located within an intergenic region on chr <dig>  all four point mutations were confirmed by di-deoxy sequencing and their origin within the as lineage was determined . two point mutations  corresponded to genetic changes previously described in the as lineage. the point mutation on chr <dig> in the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase  corresponds to a s106n substitution. it arises between as-sens and as-pyr <dig> and underlies resistance to pyr  <cit> . the mutation on chr <dig> is the missense mutation  in ubp <dig>  it arises between as-3cq and as-30cq  <cit>  .

this analysis of high-quality snps also predicted three point mutations specific to as-30cq and one point mutation specific to as-15mf, all on chromosomes other than chr <dig> . the complete set of lineage-specific mutations is therefore extremely limited suggesting that a small number of mutations account for the evolution of multiple drug resistance phenotypes in this lineage. their contribution to other drug-resistance phenotypes  will be evaluated in future investigations.

five further putative point mutations  were identified by ssaha <dig> but not by maq . these putative mutations have markedly lower quality scores and low relative coverage. one mapped to a gene without a p. falciparum orthologue and was negated by di-deoxy sequencing. the other four mapped to sub-telomeric or unassigned contigs which have reduced sequence complexity, increased mapping ambiguity and inferior reference sequence quality. we were therefore unable to amplify products from these regions for di-deoxy sequencing.

previous sequence analysis of the orthologues of four candidate genes  showed that these were not mutated in as-art  <cit> . as expected, the genome re-sequencing data presented here showed that there were no mutations in these genes in as-30cq or as-15mf either.

a major effect gene conferring artemisinin resistance was mapped to chr <dig> by lgs analysis, as described in the previous section. if the v2728f ubp <dig> point mutation is the sole mutation identified on chr <dig> and if that mutation arose between the isogenic sensitive and resistant parasite, it must be considered the critical mutation conferring the resistance phenotype. it was therefore important to evaluate the possibility that a chr <dig> mutation had been missed in our analysis.

false negative calls  could be present in areas with insufficient read coverage and/or yielding poor mapping quality . in order to evaluate the probable extent of these regions, we analysed in silico the proportion of the as-wtsi genome sequence to which  <dig> - or  <dig> base reads could be mapped uniquely . these values were  <dig> %, and  <dig> % respectively . for the experimentally obtained data,  <dig>  or  <dig> % of the genome was sequenced at ≥  <dig> read coverage for as-sens and as-30cq respectively . these metrics show that only a small percentage of the genome could not be re-sequenced with uniquely mapping reads. we also estimated the proportion of each chromosome sequence for which the experimental read coverage is low . these values range from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . these data confirm that the genome re-sequencing was almost comprehensive and that false negatives will be confined to < ~ 3% of the genome. we therefore believe that the number of point mutations missed by our analysis is likely to be zero or a very small number, or otherwise restricted to p.chabaudi-specific expanded gene families, usually located at sub-telomeric loci. the read-coverage of all nucleotides up to  <dig> kbp either side of ubp <dig> was also investigated. here, the proportion of bases with a read-coverage ≤  <dig> reads in as-30cq was  <dig> % . because a read-coverage of  <dig> exceeded that sufficient to detect a false positive snp, and because the frequency of mutations across the genome in as-30cq is so low , these data confirm that a false negative within the selection valley is highly unlikely.

bases
in silico analysis shows the number of bases and percentage of genome which can be uniquely mapped by sequence reads . experimental analysis shows the percentage of genome actually mapped by such reads, at different read-coverages  in as-sens or as-30cq. as-sens and as-30cq were analysed with  <dig> - and  <dig> base reads, respectively.

identification of insertions, deletions and copy number variants by solexa re-sequencing
we applied maq and ssaha <dig> to detect candidate insertions/deletions  and copy number variants . full details of this analysis are given in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  to summarise, we used ssaha <dig> to predict small  insertions and deletions , but no such mutations were confirmed. analysis of decreased or increased read coverage can be used to predict larger deletions and cnvs, respectively. a  <dig> bp deletion in an intergenic region of chr <dig> was confirmed by di-deoxy sequencing. a potential large  deletion at the right-hand end of chr <dig> within a rodent malaria-specific gene  was also identified but unconfirmed because appropriate dna fragments could not be amplified and sequenced, probably because of low-complexity genomic sequence. specifically, there were no predictions of indels or cnvs on chr <dig>  confirming that these mutation classes are unlikely to confer artemisinin resistance in as-30cq.

discussion
ubp <dig> mutation  confers art resistance
various lines of evidence confirm that the v2728f ubp <dig> mutation confers artemisinin resistance. the ubp <dig> mutation mapped to the bottom of the selection valley in both genetic crosses analysed . solexa re-sequencing shows that this mutation is the only genetic variation between resistant and sensitive clones on chr <dig>  sanger dideoxy-sequencing confirmed that the wild-type v <dig>  v <dig> ubp <dig> haplotype is carried by all four of the artemisinin-sensitive parasites  while v2728f  or v2697f  mutations  <cit>  are borne by parasites with artemisinin resistance .

the v2728f ubp <dig> mutation in the as lineage, was previously identified  <cit>  but its association with artemisinin resistance was not demonstrated because  the ubp <dig> mutation in as-art arose during the generation of as-30cq under chloroquine selection, and could not underpin the increase in artemisinin resistance in as-art relative to as-30cq,  the selection valley on chr <dig>  was not sufficiently dominant with a  <dig> mg kg- <dig> artemisinin selection, and  the possibility that additional mutations in genes linked to ubp <dig> on chr <dig> could not be excluded. the present data resolve these ambiguities. firstly, all clones  with ubp <dig> mutations have artemisinin-resistant phenotypes . secondly, the chr <dig> locus is strongly selected in two different additional independent crosses by  <dig> mg kg- <dig> artemisinin. three independent genetic crosses  or as-art  <cit> ) have now mapped the gene underlying artemisinin resistance to chr <dig>  thirdly, whole-genome re-sequencing confirmed that the point mutation in ubp <dig> is the only mutation on chr <dig> 

the cloned parasite as-atn  also has an artemisinin resistance phenotype but contains a different ubp <dig> mutation   <cit> . we propose that the v2697f ubp <dig> mutation underlies artemisinin resistance in as-atn too. formal confirmation of this would require an lgs analysis to identify a chr <dig> selection valley in an as-atn × aj cross , and genome re-sequencing of as-atn to confirm that there was no other mutation on chr <dig>  we believe that both ubp <dig> mutations arose  during the production of the uncloned line as-15cq  <cit>  from as-3cq under chloroquine selection . this line was subsequently subjected to further selection by chloroquine  <cit> , mefloquine  <cit>  or artesunate  <cit> . chloroquine and mefloquine are thought to have selected  v2728f ubp <dig> parasites, while artesunate is thought to have selected v2697f ubp <dig> parasites. a full discussion of these issues is included elsewhere 

the structural consequences of the v2728f ubp <dig> mutation in as-30cq  were predicted to be a reduction in de-ubiquitinating activity  <cit> . this would increase the proportion of ubiquitinated substrate, which may be destined for degradation through the  <dig> s proteasome. we suggest that reduced parasite susceptibility to artemisinin may involve increased turnover or altered trafficking of a specific protein or class of proteins , or non-specific effects such as a general increased turnover of proteins damaged by oxidative stress

the model - its generality, application and future development
the experimental integration of mutant selection, genetic linkage analysis using lgs, and genome re-sequencing is a powerful framework for the elucidation of genetic determinants without prior knowledge of the underlying biology of the phenotype. the model exploits the co-incidence between genetically defined selection valleys and isolated mutations identified by deep genome re-sequencing. importantly, it may also confirm the lack of dominant contributions from additional genes elsewhere in the genome. the approach complements reverse genetic validation  of gene candidates which may be restricted to limited numbers of pre-defined genes and gene mutations . unfortunately, a well-developed transfection system is currently not available in p. chabaudi.

the approach is applicable to many recombining organisms for which genome sequence data and experimentally tractable selectable phenotypes are available. in p. falciparum, there remain difficulties in reliably generating genetically stable drug-resistant mutants and the practicality of performing genetic crosses  <cit> . nevertheless, the approach described here may find applications in the study of human malaria. for example, a whole-genome tiling array was used to identify a large amplification event in an in vitro selected fosmidomycin-resistant p. falciparum mutant clone  <cit> . the amplified fragment included the gene encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, the putative target of fosmidomycin. deep re-sequencing technologies can add further resolution to such investigations. importantly, in addition, genetic analyses such as lgs also map the functional relationship between gene locus and phenotype; critical when elucidating resistance to drugs for which the mode of action is not well understood.

pyrosequencing assays were used here to estimate the proportions of as and aj parental alleles and to detect loci under selection. however, we envisage the future exploitation of deep short-read sequencing to rapidly define and quantitate parental snps in pooled recombinant parasites  before and after selection. we expect this to improve the detection and resolution of selection valleys in lgs experiments. it will also avoid the time required to develop pre-mapped quantitative parental markers, and permit the use of a greater range of species and strains.

the genetic basis of multi-drug resistance
the comprehensive genome re-sequencing described here identified a small number of  mutations arising in the drug-resistance lineage of p. chabaudi. these data suggest that complex multi-drug resistant phenotypes evolved with the accumulation of a relatively small number of mutations, contrary to some previous speculations  <cit> . the question arises: are all of these mutations selected  by drugs, or are some mutations neutral and randomly fixed during cloning by stochastic processes? future studies will address this question and evaluate the extent to which ubp <dig> and other mutations affect the responses of these parasites to other drugs such as chloroquine.

public health implications
the prediction of genes involved in drug resistance phenotypes has important public health implications, especially when candidate markers are proposed before resistance is commonly observed in the field, as is the case for the current study. for example, molecular genetic markers of resistance are required to monitor strategies used to contain the spread of resistant parasites. at present, we are vulnerable to the evolution of artemisinin resistance. indeed, although artemisinin combination therapies continue to be widely effective, there have been a number of recent reports documenting reduced susceptibilities of malaria parasites to artemisinin derivatives in vivo and in vitro, especially in parts of south-east asia, such as western cambodia  <cit> . although genes such as the multi-drug resistance locus, mdr <dig>  <cit> , or pfatp <dig>  <cit> , encoding an atp-ase , have been proposed to contribute to artemisinin resistance, either these markers have yet to be confirmed or it is generally believed that they mediate small effects or reflect responses to the non-artemisinin partner drug  <cit> . at present therefore, there are no generally accepted validated markers for artemisinin resistance-mediated treatment failure.

the ubp <dig> mutations are the first genetic determinants to be shown to underlie a distinct change in in vivo artemisinin responses. the relevance of mutations or polymorphisms in the ubp <dig> orthologue  to in vivo and in vitro artemisinin responses of p. falciparum parasites can now be addressed by characterising natural infections and by transfection studies in the laboratory. for example, a recent study of parasites from western cambodia  <cit>  showed that there were no corresponding mutations in ubp <dig> in artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum parasites.

the data presented here show that, in p. chabaudi, a single point mutation confers a distinct shift in artemisinin responses. however, whether further mutations in ubp <dig> or other genes may confer additional shifts in artemisinin response is still uncertain. these possibilities can be addressed by the generation of multiple independently selected resistant clones of p. chabaudi, or by selecting mutants with higher levels of resistance.

interestingly, artemisinin-resistance and v2728f ubp <dig> mutations arose in the p. chabaudi isogenic lineage before the parasites were exposed to artemisinin itself. thus, ubp <dig> mutations may prove to play a role in multi-drug resistance, as is the case for mdr <dig>  <cit> . these relationships are the subject of ongoing investigations. although a distinct change in artemisinin response is described here, observations that in vitro ic50s of artemisinin derivatives in p. falciparum are often correlated with those of structurally unrelated aminoquinolines  <cit>  may indicate that similar processes occur in human malaria parasites.

the identification of ubp <dig> mutations will augment our understanding of artemisinin-resistance mechanisms by opening up new experimental approaches, such as the identification of proteins interacting with ubp <dig>  this may clarify whether artemisinin resistance is mediated by the modulation of pre-existing drug resistance mechanisms or by interference with the pathway of artemisinin action.

combination therapies have been proposed to reduce the probability of selecting  resistant parasites  <cit> . this rationale depends upon choosing component drugs with different mechanisms of resistance, and upon the absence of pre-existing resistance to one  components. the future choice of optimal combinations may be guided by knowledge delivered using a predictive model such as that presented here.

CONCLUSIONS
experimental evolution of drug resistance, a genome-wide genetic linkage analysis  and whole genome deep re-sequencing have been used to define the mutation conferring artemisinin resistance in the malaria parasite, p. chabaudi. this system can be used for the rapid identification of candidate genetic markers of in vivo drug resistance, before resistance arises in the field. these data may be used to monitor, understand and prevent the evolution of drug resistance in the field and to choose component drugs in combination treatments designed to maximise drug longevity.
