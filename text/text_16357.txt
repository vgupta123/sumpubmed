BACKGROUND
retrievers are dogs particularly bred to retrieve birds or other small, hunted game. for the retrieval, the dogs are typically sent to the place where the shot game has fallen or to search the field for the wounded but still live game in order to return them to the hunter as quickly as possible. examples of game animals are pheasants , with a weight between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kg, mallard ducks weighing between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kg, and rabbits, with a body mass of 2–6 kg. for training, dummies with a variety of weights, such as  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> or 4 kg, are used to simulate the retrieval of various types of game. additionally, the dogs are frequently entered in hunting tests  where a standard  <dig>  kg dummy is retrieved rather than a game animal . these tests have gained in popularity with individuals who wish to respect the dogs’ natural dispositions in a way that does not involve hunting, as, the number of starts in austria increased from  <dig> in the  <dig> season to  <dig> starts in  <dig>  <cit> . with the upsurge in sporting/working activities comes the increasing importance of veterinary sports medicine, and additional focus has been placed on related special injury risks. for example, it was shown that 32 % of agility dogs incur at least one injury  <cit> . a survey of gundog lameness and injuries in great britain showed that the incidence of injuries/lameness in two shooting seasons was 25 %, including fractures, muscular injuries and articular pathologies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a labrador retriever retrieving a pheasant

sports medicine veterinarians should have an in-depth knowledge of exercise physiology and biomechanics during sport and work. research has shown that flexion of the shoulder joint increases with the height of the fence during the takeoff and bascule phases of a jump  <cit> , and that extremely high  peak vertical force  occurs in the forelimbs when landing from a hurdle jump at high speed  <cit> . with respect to retrieval dogs, carry of game or a dummy is likely to alter the forelimb load distribution. the aim of this non-randomized prospective study was to determine if pfz, vertical impulse  and paw pressure contact area  are increased in the forelimbs when carrying different weights, if step length  and stand phase duration  changes and if symmetrical weight distribution is disturbed between contralateral limb pairs.

RESULTS

the mixed model revealed a significant effects for the measurement condition  but not for the front versus hind quarter and the contralateral body side.

sl was significantly longer in forelimbs during w <dig> compared to all other conditions, but did not differ between w <dig> and w <dig>  in the hind limbs sl was significant shorter while carrying the 4 kg dummy compared to all other conditions; no significant differences were found between w <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> in the right hindlimb, whereas in the left hind limb sl during w <dig> was longer compared to w <dig> .

stand phase duration 
the mixed model revealed a significant effect for the measurement condition , the anova detected this difference significant for the right forelimb . further the mixed model revealed a significant effect for the front versus hind quarter  but not for the contralateral body side.

discussion
the results of this study support the hypothesis that the carrying of dummies alters the ground reaction force distribution but not the paw contact area. when the dogs were carrying dummies, pfz and ifz increased in the forelimbs and decreased in the hindlimbs, with no change in contralateral limb symmetry. notably, the si of the hindlimbs revealed during w <dig> conditions was slightly higher than described in normal, non-lame dogs . these results suggest that the weight of the dummy is transferred to forelimbs, which could lead to additional stress on corresponding joints, muscles and connective tissues.

it is known that weight bearing is accomplished via the humeral condyle  <cit>  and that the load is then transferred to the antebrachium via the radial head and the trochlear notch of the ulna. it was shown that with applied load of  <dig>   <dig> and 150 n a significant difference exists in the force distribution between the proximal articular surfaces of the radius and ulna, for example if a 100 n load was applied, the measured radial force was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n, but the ratio of the mean force remained close to a 50: <dig> distribution regardless of the applied load  <cit> . supraphysiological cartilage pressures can damage the cartilage matrix and subchondral bone  <cit>  and contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis  <cit> . thus, only dogs with sound elbow joints should be used for retrieving, and they should be checked regularly by veterinarians for potential orthopaedic problems. furthermore, excessive stress could lead to micro-damage or fracture of the subchondral trabecular bone, and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of fragmented medial coronoid process  <cit> . although there are no currently available studies investigating the relationship between retrieving work and elbow dysplasia and/or osteoarthritis, veterinarians should advise owners and trainers to carefully train young hunting dogs to ensure that the retrieval weights do not overstress the musculoskeletal system. even this study was performed with working retrievers, the results might be applied also to other sporting dogs  and any other dog carrying weights while playing.

the results of this study also demonstrate load redistribution, thus involving the muscles of the back and cervical spine. further studies using electromyographic techniques should be performed to investigate this in detail.

one limitation of the present study is that the measurements were taken in a laboratory environment, and thus may not accurately reflect the motions performed by dogs in the field. moreover, all measurements were taken while the animals were walking, whereas game retrieval typically occurs quickly, often at a gallop. the peak vertical forces increase with velocity, while vertical impulses decrease, due to the shorter stance phase  <cit> . one study reported pfz values of  <dig> × the bodyweight in the trailing forelimb and  <dig> × the bodyweight in the leading hindlimb of galloping dogs  <cit> , suggesting that the force redistribution described in the present study is likely to be more pronounced in dogs moving at a gallop. although this study only included labrador retrievers, the results are not influenced by breed differences, as has been reported previously  <cit> . furthermore, the walking velocity between animals and within trials was consistent, and it was shown that variance of pfz and ifz is low even in ranges between  <dig>  and  <dig>  m/s  <cit> . finally, the pressure plates only register vertical forces, and thus the effects of carrying a weight on mediolateral and craniocaudal forces cannot be evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings presented here indicate that carrying dummies of varying weight in the mouth impacts ground reaction forces in retrieving dogs. this is of scientific and clinical interest as it indicates that additional stress is exerted on the forelimb joints. therefore, the training of developing dogs should be performed with special attention to the immature skeletal system, and dogs carrying weights on a regular basis should undergo routine orthopaedic examinations.
