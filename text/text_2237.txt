BACKGROUND
genes typically affect an individual's susceptibility to a disease because mutations change either the amount or the composition of the protein encoded by the gene. it has recently been suggested that copy number variation may contribute to susceptibility to common diseases  <cit> . microarray comparative genomic hybridization  is a powerful tool that allows for high-resolution interrogation of genomic copy number imbalances of unique genomic sequences throughout the entire genome in a single experiment  <cit> . the repetitive fraction of the genome comprises diverse classes of repetitive dna that is often polymorphic. of these, the most recently discovered repeat-rich regions are those containing a high number of large-scale copy number variations   <cit>  that involve the loss or gain of large fragments of dna exceeding hundreds of kilobases. cnvs are present in the general population at varying degrees, and their role in cancer is poorly defined at the present time. while the mechanism responsible for generating the variation is unknown, cnvs have been shown to be preferentially located near known segmental duplications, or duplicons  <cit> . duplicons are large regions of the genome  that exhibit high sequence homology   <cit> , and have been linked to recurrent gene amplification in tumors  <cit> .

chronic myeloid leukemia  is characterised cytogenetically by the philadelphia translocation ), which results in the formation of a smaller than normal chromosome  <dig> known as the philadelphia chromosome, and the derivative chromosome  <dig> )  <cit> . while a great deal is known about the effects of the philadelphia translocation, there is limited knowledge of the recombinational mechanisms that lead to genomic rearrangement. saglio et al. first noted significant sequence homologies in the translocated regions and identified a  <dig> kb duplicon located near the abl <dig> and bcr genes on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. this duplicon may facilitate the philadelphia translocation in cml by favouring homologous exchange between non-syntenic regions, or through double stranded breaks  <cit> . these exchanges suggest an error within a dna repair mechanism responsible for maintaining genome integrity. similarly, it has been suggested that defects of recombinational/repair pathways may facilitate acquisition of additional cytogenetic abnormalities in cml  <cit> .

this study was initiated to investigate whether cnvs were associated with acquisition of more complex genomic alterations in cml. in particular, we were interested in determining if a cnv-dependent mechanism was associated with the presence of microdeletions seen on the der in 15–20% of patients carrying a microdeletion  <cit> . the potential of cml patients with microdeletions of der to be more generally associated with either acquired or inherited differences in cnvs has not been analyzed by acgh methods. acgh methods are beginning to document both the number of cnvs and their locations in phenotypically normal individuals  <cit> . it is not yet clear what role cnvs play in cml and cancer in general, however, it has been suggested that these sequences may be intrinsically unstable and may thus be hotspots for genomic alterations  <cit> . this study reports the identification of cnv14q <dig>  a highly imbalanced region found to be present at a higher frequency in neoplastic samples in comparison to control dna.

RESULTS
microarray comparative genomic hybridization  analysis
acgh was performed on  <dig> chronic myeloid leukemia  patients with a known deletion on the derivative  <dig> chromosome ). the presence of a deletion in these patients was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction  and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit> . acgh was performed using commercially available 1– <dig> mb resolution spectral chip  <dig> bac arrays  and analyzed using normalise suite v <dig>   <cit> . an unexpected finding was the presence of a gain on chromosome  <dig> located at the bac clone rp11-125a <dig>  hereafter called cnv14q <dig>  found in  <dig> of the  <dig> patient samples. the same clone showed a deletion in  <dig> cml sample . the bac clones on the array nearest to rp11-125a <dig> both upstream and downstream are rp11-529e <dig> and rp11-329k <dig>  respectively, both of which showed normal copy numbers in all experiments, thereby defining the minimal region of gain to a  <dig>  mb region centered at rp11-125a <dig> 

acgh analysis using a sub-megabase tiling path array  <cit> , was performed on  <dig> samples with a deletion on the der chromosome, as well as one sample not showing the der deletion, all of which carry the cnv14q <dig> event . the gain or loss of genomic material at cnv14q <dig> does not correlate with the presence of a deletion on the der. der deletion status was determined by fish analysis and confirmed by q-pcr. unfortunately, the normal control dna used in these experiments was different from that used for both the 1– <dig> mb resolution microarrays, and the q-pcr analysis, and it appears that this dna carried the cnv14q <dig>  as such, no other varitation was seen in any of the cases. the smtr-array was able to identify the deletion on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in one of the  <dig> cases where a deletion had been previously identified by fish and q-pcr analysis . project files for the spectral genomics and smrt array dataset can be viewed  and  respectively.

q-pcr results and statistical analysis
relative quantification of the amount of genomic material at cnv14q <dig> was determined using q-pcr, where the relative quantity is normalized to a haploid value. based on all of the cytogenetically normal samples  the mean haploid value was  <dig>  with a standard deviation  of  <dig> . a  <dig> sd threshold was used to assign a normal copy range of  <dig>  –  <dig> . based on q-pcr analysis of  <dig> cml patient samples that had been shown to have a gain by acgh analysis, the minimum value for a gain  was defined as  <dig>  . a deletion of cnv14q <dig> was found in one cml patient by acgh analysis. the mean q-pcr value for this sample was  <dig> , establishing a range of  <dig> – <dig>  for a deletion. the results of the q-pcr reactions based on the ranges defined here are summarized in table  <dig> .

the chi-square test  was used to compare the copy number of the cnv14q <dig> variation  between each sample group. based on χ <dig> analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of changes in cancer patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities  versus cytogenetically normal individuals . individual analysis of cml patients with a deletion , cml without a der deletion , and paediatric solid tumor samples  revealed a statistically significant difference between the number of variants in cnv14q <dig> when compared to cytogenetically normal individuals. comparison of the number of variants in cnv14q <dig> seen in cml patients with and without a der deletion showed a slight trend but no statistical difference in the frequency of the cnv14q <dig> variation in the presence of a der deletion . however, the sample size of the cml patients with a deletion was small  and thus statistical analysis was inappropriate. a larger patient cohort will be required to determine whether there is a statistical association present. comparison of the cml cohorts, with or without a der deletion, to the paediatric solid tumor cohort did not reveal a statistically significant difference . as in the case of cml, a larger cohort of patients with a der deletion may yet reveal a difference in the frequency of this variation as compared to paediatric solid tumors.

location of duplicated material using dual colour fish
dual colour fish  was used to determine the location of the gained genomic dna. the results  identified a cytogenetic duplication of genetic material on a single chromosome in an adjacent position. quantification-fish , a technique that utilizes the relative signal intensity of a target signal compared to a control probe  <cit> , showed that there is a gain of cnv14q <dig> material .

in silico analysis of the cnv14q <dig> genomic region
in silico analysis of the cnv14q <dig> genomic locus located on chromosome  <dig> in the q <dig> cytoband revealed the presence of  <dig> well characterised genes. three of these genes are pseudogenes – bcl2/adenovirus e1b  <dig> kda interacting protein , ribosomal protein l <dig> pseudogene  <dig> , and basic transcription factor  <dig> pseudogene  <dig>  – while one is a hypothetical gene . the remaining gene is foxg1b , forkhead homolog-like  <dig> , qin ). the role of foxg1b has been extensively studied in neuronal development due to its expression in the human telencephalon. this gene is also expressed in the stomach, kidney, aorta, ovary and testis, and the cochlea. it is uncertain whether it is expressed in the bone marrow and whether foxg1b would play a role in mediating survival in cml.

the genomic architecture of the cnv14q <dig> region includes  <dig> segmental duplications located upstream of rp11-529e <dig>  neither segmental duplication, nor any others, spans the amplified region in such a way that duplicons could facilitate the alterations observed here. l1-interspersed nuclear elements  are found throughout the region which is not uncommon. interestingly,  <dig> large line repeats  are present at the 5' end of rp11-125a <dig>  in addition, there are a large number of short interspersed nuclear elements that, like lines, are distributed throughout the genome.

discussion
large-scale copy number variations , and duplicons in general, are difficult to integrate into the human genome  <cit>  and the high sequence homology has recently been shown to affect microarray comparative genomic hybridization  results  <cit> . a study by locke et al. showed that the presence of duplicon material in bacs spotted on a 15q11-q <dig> region specific array resulted in muted detection of genomic alterations. they also suggested that the presence of duplicons is a consideration when designing and analyzing microarrays for acgh  <cit> .

in a recent report on the presence of cnvs located in the genome of normal individuals, iafrate et al. noted that 25% of the cnvs identified mapped to regions overlapping previously identified segmental duplications  <cit> . they showed that the correlation with known duplicons was significantly different from that determined for all clones on the array   <cit> . another report by sebat et al. confirmed that cnvs were more prevalently located at known duplicon sites than would be expected if randomly distributed. sebat et al. suggest that duplicons, unstable regions, and cnvs are probably the result of a common underlying mechanism  <cit> .

the results presented in this study also suggest an increased incidence of the cnv14q <dig> imbalance in neoplasias such as chronic myeloid leukemia  and solid tumors of childhood. interestingly, in a study of  <dig> individuals, iafrate et al. found similar results for cnv14q <dig> when examining cytogenetic aberrations in normal blood lymphocytes.  <cit>  they performed acgh analysis of  <dig> cytogenetically normal individuals as well as  <dig> individuals with a known constitutional cytogenetic abnormality. the results of this study identified a number of cnvs including  <dig> clones that were abnormal at a frequency of >20%. among these clones was cnv14q <dig> . a chi-square comparison of the prevalence of individuals with and without additional cytogenetic abnormalities revealed a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of having a variation at this locus in the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities . this suggests that the mechanism underlying the formation of this cnv and the genomic abnormalities may be the same. however, because normal constitutional dna was not available from any portrait within this study group, it was not possible to determine whether neoplastic cells acquired cnv as part of oncogenetic progression.

fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis of cml patient material revealed that cnv14q <dig> material was gained on a single chromosome located directly adjacent to the homologous material . since a split fish signal would display the same pattern, quantification of the signal intensity over a minimum of  <dig> metaphases was performed on this cml patient sample as well as a series of cytogenetically normal individuals . the results of this analysis revealed an increase in the cnv14q <dig> material thereby confirming the acgh and the real-time polymerase chain reaction  data. this duplication, along with the q-pcr results that indicate both a gain and a loss to be present at this locus in the series of patients studied, suggests that duplication/deletion occur through incorrect homologous recombination between repeats flanking this genomic locus.

in silico analysis of the region surrounding rp11-125a <dig> failed to reveal any duplicons which would be a likely mechanism for mediating the cnv14q <dig> events, however, current genomic architecture of the cnv14q <dig> region is derived from sequence data obtained from a small number of individuals and it is possible that the frequency and diversity of cnv variation at 14q <dig> in humans may be much more extensive than is apparent by analysis using current ncbi datasets.

analysis of l1-interspersed nuclear elements  elements in the region did identify  <dig> large l <dig> elements of the pa <dig> subfamily. these elements are ~ <dig> kb and ~ <dig>  kb respectively, and could possibly mediate unequal homologous recombination resulting in deletion or gain of a copy of this genomic region. line elements have been shown to play a role in disease formation through deletions of small  fragments of dna  <cit> . a number of diseases have now been shown to be the result of rearrangements between repeat regions  <cit> . in general, the greater the distance between the repeats, the larger the repeats need to be in order to mediate the event  <cit> . a recent report has shown that lines  <cit>  and palindromic at-rich repeats are associated with acquired chromosome translocation frequencies that can mediate phenotypes generated by the duplication of a large fragment  of dna  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here identified a copy number variation, cnv14q <dig>  which was observed at a high level in neoplastic dna samples. the limitations of the sample size precluded a detailed statistical analysis of subsets within the study group. despite being present at a high level in both chronic myeloid leukemia  cohorts, the presence of cnv14q <dig> failed to show a strong significant association with the presence of the derivative chromosome  <dig> ) deletion. likewise, the occurrence of the cnv14q <dig> variation was more prevalent in the paediatric tumor cohort than in control dna. these data suggest that the occurrence of cnv14q <dig> may be indicative of an error in a pathway responsible for maintaining dna integrity in neoplasia. a comparison of the cytogenetic profile of patients with cnv14q <dig> in a familial cohort would indicate whether this is an acquired event secondary to the primary cytogenetic abnormality, or a primary event indicative of faulty dna replication pathways.
