BACKGROUND
l-ascorbic acid , the reduced form of vitamin c, is an essential antioxidant for many biological systems and must be obtained via the diet by humans, primates and a few other animals which are unable to synthesise asa endogenously  <cit> . the main dietary source of asa for all these organisms are plants and insufficient intake of this micronutrient results in the onset of a debilitating disease  and eventually death. in spite of its obvious relevance for humankind, our understanding of how plants synthesise asa is still rudimentary. it was only in  <dig> that an evidence-backed asa biosynthetic pathway in plants was put forward  <cit> . the original proposal was supported by the characterisation of arabidopsis thaliana asa-deficient mutants  which were defective in the activity of a pathway enzyme  <cit> . since then, other asa-deficient a. thaliana mutants have been identified which do not seem to be affected in any of the known pathway genes  <cit> . additionally, up-regulation of asa accumulation in plants has been achieved via ectopic over-expression of biosynthetic genes unrelated to the proposed biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . this has led to proposals of additional steps, branches or alternative routes to the original pathway  <cit> .

many of the recent advances in plant asa biosynthesis have been obtained through investigations of model systems such as tobacco or arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . on the other hand, our understanding of the mechanisms controlling asa accumulation in the edible parts of crop plants , which represent the main dietary source of vitamin c  <cit>  remains limited. one problem is that asa functions outside the chloroplasts are much less understood compared with those associated with photosynthetic metabolism  <cit> . we have also no biological or taxonomic explanation for the massive variability in asa contents in sink organs such as fruits which can contain over  <dig> mg/ <dig> g fw in the fruits of camu camu   <cit>  or less than  <dig> mg/ <dig> gfw as is the case for grapes, apples or plums  <cit> . large variability is also found in non-green vegetables  <cit>  whilst dry seeds are completely devoid of asa . these examples highlight the high degree of tolerance for asa content in storage organs and suggest the biological feasibility for the development of asa-rich crop products. to this end, one key question that needs to be answered is whether asa accumulation in sink organs occurs as a result of biosynthesis in situ or import from the foliage. recently franceschi and tarlyn  <cit>  observed long distance movement of 14c-asa from leaves to flowers and root tips in model systems such as a. thaliana and medicago sativa. research in our laboratory demonstrated the occurrence of asa in the phloem of a number of crop plants and we also observed that the plant phloem was capable of supporting active asa biosynthesis from a number of precursors  <cit> . we have previously shown that rates of asa accumulation are highest soon after organ formation in sink organs such as blackcurrant berries  <cit>  and potato tubers  <cit>  when sink activity is strongly induced  <cit> . taken together, these findings indicate that sink-source relationships may play an important role in defining asa accumulation in sink organs.

in this work we have extended our investigation on asa accumulation in potato tubers, the main source of vitamin c in the european diet  <cit> . we present here evidence for the implication of long-distance transport in asa accumulation in potato tubers. additionally, we show that artificial increase of asa content in the foliage results in phloem asa enrichment and asa accumulation in tuberising stolons. our findings have implications for the development of strategies for increasing the nutritional value of crop plants.

RESULTS
detection of asa in the phloem
fig.  <dig> shows hplc chromatograms of potato source leaf phloem exudates collected from severed petioles in buffer containing either edta or cacl <dig>  total asa  appeared as the largest peak of absorbance at  <dig> nm retained by the column in both cases. when exudates were collected in the presence of cacl <dig> instead of edta, all exudate derived peaks were strongly reduced due to the reduction in exudation caused by callose gelation  <cit> . in experiments to test the stability of authentic asa  in the presence of edta or cacl <dig> exudation buffers less than 5% oxidation was observed in either case over  <dig> min . asa localisation to the vascular tissue was confirmed histochemically in sections of potato stems and tubers incubated with ethanolic agno <dig> at 3°c . intense deposition of metallic silver was observed in the vasculature of stems. in tubers metallic silver deposits appeared as short strands or well defined spots, sometimes in the perimedullary zone and also in the cortex. although agno <dig> staining and cfda treatments could not be carried out on the same section due to interference between the treatments, a clear similarity was observed in the pattern of metallic silver deposits and the distribution of fluorescence in stem and tuber sections. no agno <dig> staining was observed in control sections pre-incubated with 1% cuso <dig> for  <dig> h in order to oxidise asa   <cit> .

asa distribution during tuber development
fig.  <dig> shows asat distribution along the axis of stolons and developing tubers. in non-swelling stolons the asat content was maximal in the apical section with a sharp basipetal decline such that the more basal sections contained approximately 10% of the asat content found in the apex. tuberising stolons showed a 50% reduction in the asat content of the apical section. this was accompanied by increases in the subapical 3– <dig> mm sections. in developing tubers there was a very substantial increase in the asat content in the sub-apical region, corresponding to the swelling area.

asa transport
the correlation between leaf asat content and the asat levels of phloem exudates was also investigated in glasshouse-grown plants following the supply of a range of asa biosynthetic precursors using the flap technique  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the chromatographic asat peak area of exudates from leaves pre-treated for  <dig> h with  <dig> mm mes ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm cacl <dig> alone  or containing precursors at a final concentration of  <dig> mm. incubation with d-glucose  resulted in a slight  reduction in leaf asat content compared with the control but no significant change in asat was detected in the exudates. by contrast, supply of l-galactose  or l-galactono- <dig> -lactone  increased the asat content of leaves  and, more substantially, of exudates . with all treatments, the replacement of edta with cacl <dig> in collection wells resulted in a significant reduction of asat peak area in the exudate chromatograms.

an artificial increase of asat content in the totality of source foliage of whole plants was obtained through the supply of the direct asa precursor l-gall via the flap technique for  <dig> h to all terminal leaflets of the four lowermost nodes. at the end of the incubation period the asat content of source leaves was  <dig> -fold higher than in control plants . asat content also significantly increased in sink organs such as flowers  and, more substantially in developing tubers  compared with the control. no changes in asat levels were observed in petioles, stems or non-tuberising stolons.

discussion
asa in the potato phloem
we have previously shown that asa represented the largest peak of absorption at  <dig> nm retained by the column when phloem sap of potato source leaves obtained by aphid stylectomy was analysed by hplc  <cit> . in the present study we obtained very similar results from phloem samples collected from different organs of the potato plant by a different approach i.e. the edta exudation technique  <cit> . localisation of asa to the vascular tissue of stems and developing tubers was further demonstrated histochemically exploiting the specific interaction between asa and agno <dig> at low temperature with ensuing formation of metallic silver deposits  <cit> . in particular, the distribution of metallic silver in developing tubers generated a pattern reflecting the intense phloem anastomosis typical of these storage organs  <cit>  and resembling the phloem network involved in the unloading of labelled assimilates in plants supplied with 14co <dig>  <cit> . this was further evidenced by the close similarity between the silver nitrate staining and distribution of fluorescence in tubers following supply of cfda to source leaves. we have previously demonstrated that the distribution of cf in developing potato tubers can be used to identify symplastic phloem unloading in these organs  <cit> , thus the similar distribution of cf and metallic silver deposits in developing tubers implies that transfer of phloem asa to storage parenchyma cells occurs with the mass flow of assimilates. this hypothesis is further supported by the changes in asat distribution along the stolon axis following tuber induction which closely resemble the changes in sucrose content and radiolabelled assimilate distribution observed in plants labelled with 14co <dig>  <cit> . the decline of asat in the apices of tuberising stolons accompanied by its accumulation in the subapical region may thus reflect the induction of symplastic phloem unloading in this region resulting in a distal migration of sink activity from the apex. however, this pattern also correlates with changes in the mitotic index along the axis as a result of tuber induction with cessation of cell division in the apical region of the stolon  <cit>  and its activation in secondary meristems within the swelling region  <cit> . this may be relevant in view of the purported role of asa in cell division  <cit> .

long-distance asa transport in potato
in preliminary experiments, we observed diurnal changes in the asat content of mature source leaves of potato. circadian or diurnal oscillations of asa content in photosynthetic tissues are known  as well as light-induction of asa accumulation in leaves  and sink organs. light-induced expression of specific asa biosynthetic enzymes has been observed  as well as a general increase in the asa biosynthetic flux  <cit> . by growing plants in cabinets with out-of-phase light/dark regimes we were able to simultaneously sample plants in the dark or light phase when maximal differences in foliage asat content occurred. leaf asat content showed diurnal changes with the maximal levels  2-fold higher than the lowest levels observed in the dark. phloem exudates obtained from source and sink organs of light phase plants always showed significantly higher asat levels than exudates obtained from dark phase plants. indeed, the asat content of exudates from tuberising stolons of light phase plants was over 4-fold higher that of dark-phase plants. our findings indicate that changes in source leaf asa biosynthesis rapidly impact on the phloem asat content resulting in transport of de novo synthesised asa directly to developing sinks. this was also confirmed in experiments where exogenous asa precursors such as l-gall or l-gal were supplied to source leaves via the flap technique, a treatment which resulted in substantial asat enrichment in phloem exudates. we were also able to more than double the asat content of the source foliage of whole plants by "bulk" supply of exogenous l-gall to the majority of source leaves for  <dig> h. this resulted in significant asat increases in sink organs such as flowers and developing tubers.

to our knowledge this is the first demonstration that asa accumulation in the foliage results in asa increases in storage organs and it may explain the positive effect of light irradiation on asa content of fruits and vegetables  <cit> . the rapid changes in phloem asa concentration which reflected changes in mesophyll asa content indicate that asa storage in the foliage does not occur, unlike the case of assimilated carbohydrates. it is tempting to speculate that asa produced within mesophyll cells is directly taken up by se/cc complex for translocation, as also deduced from the results reported by franceschi and tarlyn  <cit> . the kinetics of asa transport have been studied across a number of plant membranes such as the plasmlemma, the chloroplast membrane, the thylakoid membrane and the tonoplast  <cit> . however, to date no transporter has been identified although at least  <dig> genes encoding putative nucleobase/ascorbate transporters  have been identified in the arabidopsis genome. nats belong to a superfamily of integral membrane transporters, which move purines, pyrimidines or ascorbic acid across biological membranes and which also comprises mammalian transporters specific for ascorbate  <cit> . functional characterisation of these transporters is in progress  <cit> . as the plant phloem contains the complete enzymic complement for asa biosynthesis  <cit> , we have already speculated that the indirect transfer of asa from the mesophyll to the phloem could involve the transport of the non-charged intermediate l-gal across membranes. we show here that exogenous supply of l-gal or l-gall to source leaves leads to asa enrichment of phloem exudates and asa accumulation in tuberising stolons and developing tubers. furthermore, we have observed uptake of l-gal by source phloem of potato , as already demonstrated in n. benthamiana  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the evidence we provide here for long-distance transport of asa in potato plants, corroborates earlier findings in a. thaliana and m. sativa  <cit>  and suggests that source-sink asa translocation may be a general occurrence in plants. what remains to be established is the relative contribution of phloem-derived asa  to overall asa accumulation in potato tubers. slices excised from developing potato tubers can synthesise asa from a variety of substrates . moreover, microtubers obtained in vitro from nodal cuttings cultured in the dark with sucrose as the sole carbon source contain similar amounts of asa as field-grown tubers  <cit> . these latter findings in particular are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis of a major role played by long-distance asa transport in tuber asa accumulation. the development of transgenic potato plants with tissue and organ-specific down-regulation of asa biosynthesis will be required to address this issue.
