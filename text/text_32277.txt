BACKGROUND
radish  is an annual or biennial herb of the brassicaceae family, and it is an economically important root vegetable crop produced throughout the world  <cit> . the edible part of radish is its taproot, which is an excellent source of carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and essential mineral and organic nutrients to human beings . radish roots also contain valuable phytochemicals and have been used for many medicinal purposes  <cit> . for example, the roots are a rich source of glucosinolates   <cit> . gs and their breakdown products such as isothiocyanates  are secondary metabolites widely present in the brassicaceae family. the itc contribute to the flavor and taste of the brassicaceae vegetables as an important ingredient and have anti-carcinogenic properties  <cit> .

the formation and development of taproot is a complex morphogenetic process controlled by interactions among genetic, environmental and physiological factors . essentially, fleshy root formation is a result of selective expression of related genes. however, the lack of genomic information impedes our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying taproot development. recent analysis of transcript differences between two cdna libraries from the early and late seedling developmental stages have demonstrated that a set of genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, and in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis may be the dominant metabolic pathways during the early stages of taproot formation in radish  <cit> . this has enabled the mining of genes that are possibly involved in taproot development. however, the molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of the related nutritional and flavor components during taproot formation are not well known, especially for many secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates.

next-generation sequencing  -based rna sequencing for transcriptome methods  allows simultaneous acquisition of sequences for gene discovery as well as transcript identification involved in specific biological processes. this is especially suitable for non-model organisms whose genomic sequences are unknown . in recent years, rna-seq has emerged as a powerful method for discovering and identifying genes involved in biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites, such as, carotenoid biosynthesis in momordica cochinchinensis <cit> , cellulose and lignin biosynthesis in chinese fir  <cit> , tea-specific compounds i.e. flavonoid, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis pathways in tea  <cit> , biosynthesis of flavonoid in safflower  <cit> , biosynthesis of active ingredients in salvia miltiorrhiza  <cit>  and biosynthesis of capsaicinoid in chili pepper  <cit> .

glucosinolate content is a main trait of radish cultivars and is important for flavor formation and nutritional quality of the taproot  <cit> . previous studies mainly focused on developing analysis methods to determine gs content in radish, and also to determine variation in gs composition or content in different cultivars, growing conditions, and growth stages  <cit> . furthermore, three candidate genes for controlling the gs content in radish roots were identified from single nucleotide polymorphism  markers developed with gs  <cit> . however, molecular mechanisms underlying gs metabolism in radish still require elucidation, especially for identification of the full set of genes involved in these related pathways.

in the present study, ngs-based illumina paired-end solexa sequencing platform was employed to characterize the fleshy taproot de novo transcriptome in radish. a large set of radish transcript sequences were obtained to discover the majority of the activated genes involved in radish taproot. the candidate genes involved in the glucosinolate metabolism and regulation were successfully identified in radish. the sequence of representative genes and expression patterns were further validated. the root de novo transcriptome was comprehensively characterized in radish. this would provide a public information platform for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the metabolism of nutritional and flavor components during taproot formation, and facilitate the genetic improvement of quality traits in radish molecular breeding programs.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and de novo assembly of radish root transcriptome
to develop a comprehensive overview of the radish root transcriptome, a cdna library denoted as ‘cka’, prepared from three mixed rna samples from taproots at different stages of development  was subjected to pair-end read  sequencing with the illumina platform. it has been reported that pe sequencing not only increases the depth of sequencing, but also improve de novo assembly efficiency  <cit> . after removing the reads with adaptors, reads with unknown nucleotides larger than 5% and low quality reads,  <dig> , <dig> clean pe reads consisting of  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides  were obtained with an average gc content of  <dig> % . the output was similar to a previous study on radish transcriptome from two root cdna libraries, which generated a total of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million clean reads, respectively  <cit> . all high-quality clean reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 299 bp, and the length distribution of the assembled contigs was as shown in additional file 1a. the contigs were further joined into  <dig>  unigenes with a n <dig> length of 1095 bp, and a total length of  <dig>  mb using paired-end information and gap-filling process . majority of the unigenes ranged from  <dig> to 1500 bp, and accounted for  <dig> % of all unigenes  .table  <dig>

functional annotation and classification of the assembled unigenes
in total,  <dig>   unigenes significantly matched a sequence in at least one of the public databases including ncbi non-redundant protein , gene ontology , clusters of orthologous groups , swiss-prot protein and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  . the rate of annotated unigenes was higher than the range of previously studies in other non-model species , indicating their integrity and the relatively conserved functions of the assembled transcript sequences in radish  <cit> . the size distribution of the blast-aligned coding sequence  and predicted proteins are shown in figure 1a, b, respectively. the remaining  <dig> % of unigenes  that did not match sequences in the databases were analyzed by estscan to predict coding regions. an additional  <dig>  unigenes  also showed orientation in the transcriptome coding sequence . the sequences without a homologous hit may represent novel genes specifically expressed in radish root; or they could be attributed to other technical or biological biases, such as assembly parameters. furthermore, some cdnas are non-coding, lineage-specific or highly variable, which need to be further verified .figure  <dig>

summary statistics of functional annotation for radish root unigenes in public databases


for the nr annotations,  <dig>  of the unigenes  were found to be matched in the database. further analysis of the blast data indicated that  <dig> % of the top hits showed strong homology with the e-value <  <dig> e- <dig>  while  <dig> % of the matched sequences showed moderate homology with the e-value between  <dig> e-5and  <dig>  e- <dig> . the identity distribution pattern showed that  <dig> % of the sequences had a similarity higher than 80%, while  <dig> % showed similarity between 19% and 80% . the majority of the annotated sequences corresponded to the known nucleotide sequences of plant species, with  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % matching with a. lyrata subsp. lyrata, a. thaliana, thellungiella halophila, b. napus and b. oleracea, respectively . all the top five species with blast hits belonged to the brassicaceae family, implying that the sequences of the radish transcripts obtained in the present study were assembled and annotated properly  <cit> .figure  <dig>

go annotation is an international classification system that can provide standardized vocabulary for assigning functions of the uncharacterized sequences  <cit> . blast2go program was used to get go terms for all assembled unigenes and a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were assigned at least one go term. in many cases, multiple terms were assigned to the same transcript, and all the go terms were classified into  <dig> functional groups including biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function at the second level . among biological processes, transcript sequences assigned to cellular  and metabolic processes  were the most abundant. within the molecular function category, the majority of the go terms were predominantly assigned to binding  and catalytic activity . for cellular components, those assignments were mostly given to cell  and cell part . the findings revealed that the main go classifications involved in the annotated unigenes were responsible for fundamental biological regulation and metabolism. these results were concurrent with a previously reported study of de novo transcriptome analysis in tuberous root of sweet potato  <cit> .figure  <dig>

every protein in the cog database is assumed to be evolved from an ancestor, and the whole database is built on coding proteins with complete genomes as well as system evolution relationships of bacteria, algae and eukaryotes  <cit> . overall,  <dig>  of  <dig>   unigenes were assigned to the cog classification . since some of these unigenes were annotated with multiple cog functions, a total of  <dig>  functional annotations were produced. among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for ‘general functions prediction only’  associated with basic physiological and metabolic functions represented the largest group, followed by ‘transcription’ , ‘replication, recombination and repair’ , ‘post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’ , and ‘signal transduction mechanisms’ , whereas only few unigenes were assigned to ‘extra cellular structures’ and ‘nuclear structure’ .figure  <dig>

kegg pathway database can facilitate to systematically understand the biological functions of genes in terms of networks  <cit> . to identify the biological pathways activated in radish roots, the assembled unigenes were annotated with kegg orthology  numbers using blastx alignments against kegg with a cut-off e value of 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unigenes were significantly matched in the database, and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the result showed that the five largest pathway groups were metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , plant hormone signal transduction , plant-pathogen interactions  and rna transport  . in metabolism categories, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites represented the most predominant pathways, which were sorted into  <dig> subcategories including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glucosinolate biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, betalain biosynthesis and some others . these annotations of gene or protein names and descriptions, gene ontology terms, putative conserved domains, and potential metabolic pathways would provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways involved in radish taproot development. these genes involved in the enrichment of secondary metabolite biosynthesis related pathways would greatly enhance the potential utilization of the radish root in nutrition and pharmacy.figure  <dig>

identification of candidate genes involved in the glucosinolate metabolism of radish
in the past decade, the main pathway of glucosinolate  biosynthesis has been well understood in a. thaliana and b. rapa, and many critical genes have been successfully discovered and functionally characterized  <cit> . the biosynthesis of gs is generally divided into three independent phases:  amino acid side-chain elongation of selected precursor amino acids ,  core structure formation,  and subsequent side-chain modification . according to the currently accepted gs biosynthetic pathways in a. thaliana and b. rapa, a total of  <dig> unigenes in our transcriptome dataset were found to be homologous to the previously identified genes encoding all of the eight related enzymes of all three phases. the result indicated that this pathway was rather well conserved in brassicaceae family. furthermore,  <dig> unigenes were found to be homologous to the genes encoding myrosinase, which is a critical functional enzyme involved in the gs degradation . in most cases, more than one unique sequence was annotated as encoding the same enzyme. such sequences may represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
assembled radish unigenes that may be involved in the glucosinolates metabolism pathway. the numbers in brackets following each gene name indicate the number of transcritome unigenes annotated to that gene.



initially, the parent amino acid is deaminated to form the corresponding 2-oxo acid by a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase . in a. thaliana, there are seven genes encoding the bcats, and it is known to be fairly well conserved  <cit> . in our annotated radish transcriptome unigene dataset,  <dig> sequences corresponding to five homologous bcat genes  were successfully identified. subsequently, methylthioalkylmalate synthase  catalyzes 2-oxo acid condense with acetyl-coa to yield a 2-oxo acid with one more methylene group  than the starting compound. hereupon, the elongated 2-oxo acid can enter the core glucosinolate structure pathway or proceed through another round of chain elongation. seven sequences encoding mam were discovered in our transcriptomic analysis.

the formation of primary glucosinolates involved in core structure biosynthesis is accomplished through five different biochemical steps that synthesize several intermediates. it begins with the oxidation of the precursor amino acids to aldoximes by cytochromes p <dig> belonging to the cyp <dig> family, which is composed of a number of catalytic subfamilies. genome analyses have revealed that arabidopsis contains seven different cyp <dig> genes   <cit> . in the current study, ten unigene sequences were identified corresponding to the seven different genes with a high homology to cyp79s. all these seven gene members in the arabidopsis genome were also identified in the radish transcriptome, which further confirmed the close relationship between these two species. aldoximes are further oxidized to activated compounds  by cytochromes p <dig> of the cyp <dig> family. based on sequence similarities, four unigenes were identified corresponding to the two cyp <dig> genes . the activated aldoximes are conjugated with cysteine as a sulfur donor to produce s-alkyl-thiohydroximates; however, it is not clear whether this conjugation is enzyme-mediated. the s-alkylthiohydroximate conjugates are converted to thiohydroximates by the c-s lyase superroot <dig>   <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> homolog sequences were discovered encoding sur <dig>  thiohydroximates are in turn s-glucosylated by glucosyltransferases of the ugt <dig> family to form desulfoglucosinolates. overall,  <dig> unigenes were identified as ugt74s including ugt74b <dig>  c <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  the final step in the synthesis of the gs core structure was catalyzed by desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase . there are three close homologous sot genes , which were identified in arabidopsis to catalyze this reaction with a wide variety of desulfoglucosinolate substrates  <cit> . a total of  <dig> unigenes from our rna-seq dataset were identified as sots including all three homologies found in arabidopsis.

the initially produced parent glucosinolate from core structure is subject to a wide range of side chain modifications, which entail various kinds of reactions including oxidations, eliminations, alkylations, and esterifications. kliebenstein et al.  identified three genes responsible for side chain modification of aliphatic glucosinolates in arabidopsis by qtl analyses  <cit> , named gs-ox, gs-aop and gs-oh; and functionally characterized two genes including aop <dig>  aop <dig> of the gs-aop cluster. in this study,  <dig> unigenes ranging from 252 bp to  <dig>  bp were homologous to the genes encoding gs-ox; however, the other genes corresponding to the modification of side chain could not be identified.

upon plant damage, the gs can be degraded to a variety of hydrolysis products such as isothiocyanates, oxazolidine-2-thiones, nitriles, epithionitriles, and thiocyanates. the hydrolytic process is catalyzed by a beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase . until now, myrosinase genes have been isolated from many plant species such as turnip, a. thaliana and mustard , which indicated that these genes are encoded by a multigene family and were classified into four subtypes on the basis of amino acid sequences  <cit> . additionally, two cdna clones of myrosinase were isolated from radish seedlings, and both of them were identified as b type myrosinases  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> unigenes were found which were homologs of genes encoding myrosinase, and most of them were predicted as mb subtypes.

identification of genes involved in myb transcription factors
myb transcription factors represent a family of proteins that include the conserved myb dna-binding domain, which can control diverse pathways and processes corresponding to plant secondary metabolism  <cit> . it was reported that many members of the myb family could regulate the expression of related genes at the transcriptional level to control the process of gs metabolism in a. thaliana. for example, myb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exerted a specific and coordinated control on the regulation of aliphatic gs biosynthesis, while myb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could regulate the synthesis of indolic gs  <cit> . from our radish transcriptome analysis, a total of  <dig> unigenes were predicted to code myb proteins including a large number of members  . however, the specific function of the particular myb member in gs metabolism of radish need to be further verified with functional genomics approach.

validation and expression analysis of genes involved in gs metabolism
to check the quality of the assembly and annotation data from the solexa sequencing, full-length cdna sequences of eight selected genes from glucosinolate metabolism and regulation process were isolated by t-a cloning with the sanger method and compared with the assembled sequences. the length of these genes varied from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp . overall, the assembled unigenes covered more than 95% of the corresponding full-length genes and two of them were predicted to contain the complete orf. additionally, the sequence variation was minimal , which validated the ngs-based rna-seq procedures was reliable.table  <dig>

the qrt-pcr analysis was used to compare the dynamic expression patterns of four selected genes, rsbcat <dig>  rsugt74b <dig>  rsgs-ox <dig> and rsmyr <dig>  in different organs at three developmental stages. it was reported that several genes involved in the gs metabolism showed distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns in different species such as bcat gene in a. thaliana <cit> , and myr gene in b. napus <cit> , horseradish  <cit> , and radish  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of all these four genes in radish roots exhibited variations among different organs from different stages. rsbcat <dig> was expressed weakly in root  at taproot thickening and mature stage, and the remaining samples showed inconspicuous changes. rsugt74b <dig> exhibited higher expression in leaf and stem at seedling stage, and in stem at taproot thickening stage, whereas weaker expression was observed in root at all developmental stages. the expression of rsgs-ox <dig> in root decreased in the following order: seedling, taproot thickening, and mature stage. obvious changes in the expression level of rsmyr <dig> were observed among organs at mature stages , but exhibited inconspicuous variations at the other two stages.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, ngs-based illumina paired-end solexa sequencing platform was employed to characterize the fleshy taproot de novo transcriptome in radish. approximately  <dig>  million paired-end reads representing  <dig>  unigenes with a n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp, and a total length of  <dig>  mb were obtained. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were successfully annotated by blastx analysis using the publicly available protein database. it was revealed that the main genes activated in radish taproot, were predominately involved in basic physiological and metabolic processes, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, signal transduction mechanisms, and other cellular components and molecular function related terms based on their matches in the go, cog and kegg databases. this study demonstrated that the illumina paired-end sequencing technology is a fast and cost-effective method for novel gene discovery in non-model plant organisms. furthermore, radish unigenes provided a comprehensive enough coverage to allow for the discovery of almost all genes known to be involved in gs metabolism and regulation related pathways. our transcriptome dataset will serve as a valuable public platform to enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying biosynthesis and metabolism of the nutritional and flavor components during taproot formation. it would further facilitate the genetic improvement of major quality traits in radish breeding programs.
