BACKGROUND
the protein doublecortin  plays a key role in neuronal migration during development by binding and stabilizing microtubules as cells migrate towards the brain surface. mutations in dcx induce marked migration defects in humans leading to subcortical band heterotopia  in females and to the more severe lissencephaly  in males  <cit> . in the adult brain, dcx is still expressed by immature neurons within the neurogenic niches, in the dentate gyrus  and in the subventricular zone . dcx expression in the dg correlates with the extent of adult neurogenesis  <cit>  and dcx+ neurons are required for successful acquisition of spatial learning  <cit> . hence, dcx has been widely used as marker of neuronal precursor cells and neurogenesis.

following stroke, dcx was found to be highly expressed in the perilesional cortex of focal ischemic infarcts - beyond the circumscribed neurogenic regions  <cit> . notably, the numbers of dcx+ cells in the infarct vicinity positively correlate with the recovery of functional deficits  <cit> . in contrast, transgenic conditional ablation of dcx worsens stroke outcome both in the short and long term on a consistent basis  <cit> . however, it remains unclear which cells in the perilesional zone  express dcx. a few studies provide evidence of neuroblast migration from the subventricular zone as well as of the rostral migratory stream towards the lesion  <cit> . but both the extent and distribution of dcx expression raise doubts on whether the majority of dcx+ cells in the infarct vicinity actually migrate from the svz. it is more likely that local residing cells  are stimulated to express dcx following ischemia.

the goal of the present study was to characterize the perilesional dcx+ cells in detail with regard to the following three considerations;  <dig>  do cells show a distinct morphology and distribution?  <dig>  whether the cells express different immunhistochemical markers, and if so which ones?  <dig>  what is the time course of dcx expression?

using a focal ischemia model in mice, we demonstrate the presence of two subpopulations of dcx+ cells in the perilesional zone. the more abundant dcx+ cell type reveals a stellate morphology, coexpression of gfap and s100b and a similar distribution in the perilesional cortex and the corpus callosum – region . the other dcx+ cell type with a stronger dcx-expression has fewer processes with polar orientation, is mainly located in cc-region, and does not show any expression of glial markers. our findings provide evidence that in a murine model of focal ischemia, the majority of dcx+ cells in the perilesional zone are of glial nature.

RESULTS
morphology of the photothrombotic infarcts
all animals analyzed in the experimental subgroups showed typical cortical infarcts in the sensorimotor cortex. the cortical infarct affected all cortical layers leaving the underlying white matter in the majority of animals intact. the mediolateral diameter of the lesions was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm .

identification of two dcx+ cell populations in the perilesional zone
our morphological analysis of randomly chosen dcx+ cells  in the perilesional zone according to shape and, in particular according to the number of processes and their orientation showed two distinct dcx+ cell subpopulations . one cell type, which we termed as the dcx+ stellate cell revealed several processes radially extending from the soma. the second cell type had only one or two processes with a strict polar orientation and we named this cell type, the dcx+ polar cell. intensity of dcx-expression was consistently stronger in the dcx+ polar cells. in the next step, we quantified the two dcx+ cell populations in the pz. in particular, we aimed to determine whether both cell types revealed differences in abundance and spatial distribution in the infarct vicinity. to this effect we defined different regions of the pz as follows: i) the medial cortex, ii) the lateral cortex, summarized as the cortex-region, and iii) the corpus callosum - region . quantification using a semiautomatic stereological system showed that the number of dcx+ stellate cells were significantly increased by a factor of  <dig>  in the cortex-region of the pz at day  <dig>  . in comparison to the contralateral side, the number of dcx+ stellate cells remained persistently elevated with a slight decrease at day  <dig> and  <dig> . no differences were detected between the medial and lateral cortex of the pz. thus, both regions were summarized as the cortex region of the pz. notably, the number of dcx+ stellate cells in the contralateral side did not change over time. in the cc-region, we observed an increase of dcx+ stellate cells to a similar extent to that in the cortex-region of the pz. quantification yielded a  <dig> -fold elevation of these cells  at day  <dig> . the increase was persistent with a decline over time at other time points, .figure  <dig> two distinct dcx+ cells can be distinguished in the pz. representative images of 40 μm brain sections of c <dig> mice following immunohistochemical staining of dcx. , overview of the circumscribed cortical ischemic infarct. , example of dcx+ cell with multiple processes and weaker immunoreactivity, termed dcx+ stellate cells.  the second dcx+ cell type revealed a polar morphology with one or two processes, note the higher signal intensity of dcx. scale bars 20 μm.

in summary, dcx+ stellate cells were seen more frequently in the perilesional zone, revealed a similar distribution in both the cortex- and cc-regions, and were persistently increased at all time points. in contrast, dcx+ polar cells were detected only within the cc-region and found increased particularly at early time points in comparison to the contralateral side.

dcx+ stellate cells express glial markers whilst polar cells do not
characterisation of the proliferative activity of the two cell populations by brdu labeling showed that 17% of dcx+ stellate cells were brdu-positive at day  <dig> in the cortex- and cc-regions, respectively. at the latter time points , brdu-labeling of the dcx-stellate cells increased, indicating ongoing proliferative activity after day  <dig> . analysis of the proliferation marker in the dcx+ polar cells revealed a coexpression of brdu in 26% of the cells at day  <dig> . however, with respect to brdu labeling, there was no difference to the contraleral side where 32% of dcx+/brdu+ cells were also seen. compared to controls, numbers of brdu+/dcx+ polar cells did not differ significantly at the other time points. thus, proliferation appeared to be increased especially in the stellate cells of the ipsilateral hemisphere.

coexpression studies of other cytochemical markers yielded the following results: >80% of dcx-stellate cells coexpressed the glial markers gfap and s100b whilst overlap of gfap and s <dig> b expression was almost complete . in contrast, dcx+ polar cells expressed neither glial proteins nor other markers investigated in the study . notably, both cell types revealed no colocalisation with the mature neuronal marker .figure  <dig> coexpression of glial markers by dcx+ stellate cells.  confocal images of single dcx+ stellate cell expressing s100beta.  quantification of gfap expression by dcx+ stellate cells in the cortex- and cc-region, respectively. bars represent mean ± sd. significant differences were indicated as follows: **, *. scale bar 20 μm.

immunohistochemical analysis was performed by confocal microscopy studies of double or triple labelled sections. the distinct markers are considered to characterize the following cell types or development stages, brdu: thymidine analogon labelling the proliferating cells. gfap and s100beta: astrocytes. neun: mature neurons. pax <dig> and sox2: precursor cells. cnpase: oligodendrocytes. iba <dig> and cd68: microglia. dclk: radial glia and neuronal precursor cells.



we further analyzed the expression pattern of doublecortin-like  protein by using specific antibodies provided by bjarte havik, bergen, norway. herein, we found no dcl expression in either dcx+ stellate or in dcx+ polar cells, respectively. the doublecortin-like  protein is a splicing variant of the doublecortin-like kinase  which shares 73% amino acid identity with dcx over its entire length of  <dig> amino acids and also has two dcx domains  <cit> . dcl is expressed in radial glia-like cells  during embryogenesis and neuronal precursor cells in the adult svz  <cit> .

finally, there have been recent reports stating that different primary ab might yield variable dcx staining patterns  <cit> . herein and in previous experiments, we primarily used the c <dig> ab  that is specific against the carboxyl terminus of dcx protein and revealed reliable intense staining in neurogenic regions  <cit>  as well as in the cortex  <cit> . our data is in line with the findings of other groups who analyzed the specificity of c <dig> ab to dcx  <cit> . however, to verify our results we performed a series of test staining with a different dcx antibody  which did no differ in its staining patterns.

taken together our findings suggest that the majority of dcx+ stellate cells are of glial origin and that dcx+ polar cells might constitute migrating precursors.

discussion
dcx has been identified as a microtubule-associated protein expressed by migrating neuroblasts during a limited phase of their growth in both developing and adult mammals  <cit> . dcx plays a crucial role in neuronal migration by virtue of being involved in microtubule stabilization  <cit> , nuclear translocation  <cit>  and growth cone dynamics  <cit> .

in the adult normal brain, expression of dcx is rare exterior to the neurogenic areas of the hippocampal formation and subventricular zone. brown et al. found only one dcx+ cell in every 20– <dig> sections of normal adult rat neocortex  <cit> . under pathophysiological conditions, such as in epilepsy, the expression patterns of dcx are altered and dcx+ cells have been observed in distinct cortical areas  <cit> . in addition, the dcx+ cell could be detected within the striatum and cortex following ischemia  <cit> . in line with these findings, we showed in a previous study that a major subset of proliferating brdu+ cells coexpressed dcx in the cortical perilesional zone two weeks after focal infarct  <cit> . apparently these cells did not give rise to neurons since observed no brdu+/neun+ cells at a latter time point, i.e. six weeks following ischemia. thus, the nature of dcx+ cells in the ischemic cortex remains elusive.

herein, we demonstrate that dcx+ cells in the pz do not constitute a homogenous cell population but comprise two distinct dcx+ cell types. the more abundant dcx+ cell type revealed a stellate morphology, was homogenously distributed in the pz  and typically expressed glial markers. the other dcx+ cell type was characterized by polar morphology with one or two processes. in addition, we detected no co-labeling with the mature neuronal marker neun in both dcx+ cell types on a constant basis at the different time points, indicating that dcx+ cells do not differentiate into neurons in the pz. taken together, our results strongly suggest that the majority of dcx+ cells in the perilesional murine cortex are of glial nature.

dcx is generally considered to be a reliable marker of immature neurons and neurogenesis  <cit> . our results challenge this assumption, in particular with regard to the lesioned brain exterior to the neurogenic regions. importantly, other authors have also documented dcx expression in glial cells in previous studies. for example, in an early report, nacher et al. described dcx+ cells in brain parenchyma that showedthe morphology of astrocytes  <cit> . in addition, verwer et al.  reported dcx+ astrocytes in the neocortex of post-mortem human brain tissue. their data indicate that differentiated astrocytes in the human neocortex associated with various disease backgrounds may contain dcx at levels around the detection threshold  <cit> . further, bloch et al.  analyzed the expression pattern of dcx and colocalization with distinct cell markers in the cerebral cortex of primates and humans. they found a significant number of cortically located cells expressing dcx. 26% of the dcx+ cells coexpressed gfap. notably, they confirmed their findings by comparing three different sources of antibodies against dcx  <cit> . however, the significance of glial dcx expression still remains speculative. verwer et al. have suggested a function of dcx in the glia-to-neuron communication. it is also conceivable that dcx plays a role in the migration of astrocytes following insults. alternately, dcx expression might indicate transdifferentiation of mature astrocytes towards a more plastic “stem cell like” phenotype. our previous findings demonstrating that recovery following stroke correlates with the dcx expression in the pz  <cit>  suggest a considerable role of dcx in the reorganization of the ischemic brain. however, future studies are necessary to address these questions.

the second dcx+ cell type with a clear polar orientation was almost exclusively detectable in the cc-region close to the subventricular zone. in contrast to the stellate cells, dcx+ polar cells did not express any glial protein or other markers analyzed in the current study . the morphology and location of the dcx+ cells are suggestive of a precursor cell migrating from the subventricular zone. the dcx+ polar cells also appeared to be much brighter in immunofluorescence studies indicating a higher level of dcx expression. in line with previous findings, the stronger dcx signal might be another hint that the dcx+ polar cells are possibly migrating precursor cells  <cit> . however, we were unable to directly prove the migration of polar cells from svz to the lesion because we did not perform lineage tracing experiments.

finally, some authors report a coexpression of ng <dig> chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  by dcx+ cells in the cortex  <cit> . ng <dig> cells comprise the major proliferating cell population in the adult brain. they are mainly considered to be oligodendrocyte progenitors. although, there is an ongoing debate as to whether, under certain conditions, ng <dig> cells display features of multipotent precursor cells and give rise to neurons  <cit> . here, we did not perform co-labeling of dcx and ng <dig> which might be considered as one limitation of our study. however, in this study our focus was not on oligodendrogenesis but rather on the analysis of the co-expression of other glial markers by dcx-positive cells.

in summary, our study sheds more light on the dcx+ cell population in the perilesional zone of ischemic infarcts in mice. it challenges the view that doublecortin is a specific marker of cells committed to neuronal lineage in particular outside of the neurogenic regions in the lesioned brain. further studies are required to elucidate the functional role of the distinct dcx+ cells following ischemia.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our study provides evidence that in mice dcx+ cells in the perilesional zone of focal cortical infarcts comprise two distinct cell populations. according to their morphology and marker expression the majority of dcx+ cells have a glial nature.
