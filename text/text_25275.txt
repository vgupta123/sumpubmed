BACKGROUND
γδt cells play important roles in immune responses by their capacity to produce ifn-γ  <cit> , down-modulate immune responses following pathogen clearance  <cit>  and develop recall responses to antigen  <cit> . thus it is important to understand the manner by which they are engaged in immune responses. workshop cluster  <dig>  co-receptors are group b scavenger receptor cysteine-rich  transmembrane glycoproteins that are unique to γδt cells  <cit>  of some species including cattle  <cit> , sheep   <cit>  and swine  <cit> , but have not yet been identified for humans or mice. since different molecular forms of wc <dig> are found on functionally distinct subpopulations of bovine γδt cells  <cit> , we propose it to be a pattern recognition molecule and/or involved in regulating signaling through the t cell receptor . support for this comes from other group b srcr molecules found on immune system cells including cd <dig> which is a positive and negative regulator of tcr and b cell receptor signaling  <cit>  and cd <dig> which functions as an adhesion molecule  <cit>  and for activation  <cit> . also cd <dig>  predominantly expressed on monocytes and macrophages  <cit> , plays an important role in down-regulating inflammatory responses  <cit>  while dmbt <dig> on macrophages functions as a pattern recognition molecule .

diversity among the immune system-associated srcr molecules can result from alternative splicing of their individual genes. cd <dig> and cd <dig> undergo alternative splicing within the cytoplasmic tail region  <cit>  but function of these isoforms is unclear. both cd <dig> and dmbt <dig> undergo extensive alternative splicing of the extracellular and cytoplasmic coding regions, and a cd <dig> isoform lacking the transmembrane region has been described  <cit> . while the predominant short-tailed cd <dig> variant mediates ligand internalization and degradation, the function of the long-tail cd <dig> variant is unknown  <cit>  as is the role of dmbt <dig> splice variants. alternatively spliced variants have also been reported for swine and sheep wc <dig> orthologs, splicing occurs within both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, and isoforms lacking the transmembrane region have been identified  <cit> . thus while isoform formation appears to be common among srcr molecules, diversity of immunoreceptors can also result from multiple genes and in this regard wc <dig> is distinguished from the others.

although wc <dig> is unique among group b srcr molecules because it alone is coded for by a large multi-gene family  <cit> , other non-srcr immunoreceptors are coded for by multi-gene families including the c-type lectin-like ly <dig>  ly <dig> is a major receptor that regulates natural killer  cells and some t cells. it has  <dig> functional genes in mice  <cit> , but only a single copy in humans  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> . additionally, the killer ig-like receptor  multi-gene family found on nk and t cells of primates  <cit>  and cattle  <cit>  encodes products that are functionally similar to but structurally distinct from those of the ly <dig> family. both the kir and ly <dig> gene families are believed to have resulted from rapid repeated gene duplication  <cit> . it has been speculated that these families of closely related non-rearranging immunoreceptors have evolved to include large numbers of duplicated genes to keep pace with rapidly changing ligands. this appears to be the case for mhc class i molecules, which comprise a large family and are the ligands for ly <dig> receptors in mice and rats and for kir family members in cattle and primates  <cit> . we hypothesize that in the case of γδt cells wc <dig> is similarly important in inducing and perpetuating γδt cell responses thus necessitating the expansion of the wc <dig> repertoire. this is supported by previous studies showing that antigen responsive wc1+ γδt cells express a restricted set of tcr gamma genes regardless of the wc <dig> molecule found on the cells  <cit>  and that subpopulations of γδt cells that respond to different stimuli express different wc <dig> molecules  <cit> .

while three distinct wc <dig> molecular forms have been distinguished based on partial sequence and their reactivity with monoclonal antibodies   <cit> , the number of wc <dig> genes found in the bovine genome and their sequences has yet to be resolved. only one full-length nucleotide sequence is publicly available   <cit> . for sheep wc <dig> , over  <dig> genes are predicted  <cit>  based on southern blot analysis while for cattle many related genes are predicted based on southern blots  <cit>  and  <dig> based on cdna sequences of the wc <dig> intracytoplasmic tails  <cit> . while the number of genes coding for porcine wc <dig> proteins is unknown, swine have a more abbreviated version of wc <dig> which has  <dig> srcr domains. this suggests swine wc <dig> genes did not undergo the same internal srcr domain-duplication that occurred in cattle  <cit>  since previously described bovine wc <dig> molecules have  <dig> srcr domains  <cit> . by annotating the bovine genome btau_ <dig>  assembly, here we demonstrate the existence of  <dig> members in the wc <dig> family and show their organization within two loci including a bovine gene coding for the putatively more primitive and smaller swine-like wc <dig> molecule. we also provide cdna evidence as verification for many of the annotated sequences as well as for isoforms derived by alternative splicing.

RESULTS
annotation of wc <dig> genes
here we set out to annotate the bovine genome to confirm the existence of the large number of wc <dig> genes  transcript analyses supported for cattle  <cit> . while diversity in cattle wc <dig> molecules could result from alternative gene splicing as occurs for another t cell expressed-srcr gene cd <dig>  <cit> , southern blots indicated up to  <dig> wc <dig> genes in the closely related ruminant species of sheep  <cit> . it is known that in ruminants wc <dig> srcr domains are each encoded by a single exon and that at least archetypal wc <dig>  consists of  <dig> srcr domains, the first of which is a unique domain  <dig> followed by a region of  <dig> srcr domains that is repeated once  <cit> . archetypal wc <dig>  also has three inter-domain regions and a transmembrane region that are encoded by single exons and a cytoplasmic tail coded by either  <dig> or  <dig> exons  <cit> . using this paradigm as a starting point, we identified three types of wc <dig> genes based on unique exon-intron structures . all three types contained exons coding for highly-related repeating srcr domains, inter-domain sequences, transmembrane domains and intracytoplasmic tail domains. the distinguishing features between the types represented by the schematic in figure 1a  and figure 1b  is that type i genes contained one less exon than type ii genes for a total of  <dig> or  <dig> exons, respectively. this additional exon in type ii was found within the intracytoplasmic coding sequence and accounts for the "long-tail" wc <dig> molecular form  <cit>  which can have  <dig> to more amino acids in the intracytoplasmic tail region than are found in type i genes. both of the types shown in figure 1a and figure 1b demonstrates that wc <dig> genes encompass a coding region of approximately  <dig> kb. this is in contrast with the third type of wc <dig> genes identified here , which contained  <dig> exons total and encompassed a coding region of approximately  <dig> kb. type iii genes code for a wc <dig> molecule structurally similar to the described swine wc <dig> with  <dig> srcr domains  <cit> . unlike type i and type ii genes, whose intracytoplasmic domains are encoded by four or five exons, respectively, type iii genes appear to have a much longer intracytoplasmic domain which is encoded by six exons resulting in approximately  <dig> additional acids relative to type i.

using these three gene structures as a basis for annotation of glean gene-prediction models from the btau_ <dig>  assembly, the organization and orientation of  <dig> wc <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> was determined . wc <dig> genes were identified on four scaffolds including chr <dig> , chr <dig> , chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  and chromosomal locations are reported in table  <dig>  annotated genomic wc <dig> sequences were classified and named generally based on chromosomal location. the following glean gene models were identified by blast search using the archetypal wc <dig> sequence and were manually annotated as wc <dig> genes: glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_00457/glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> , glean_ <dig> . the presence of two glean gene models for wc1- <dig> was noted; however, the genomic sequence found within the introns and flanking the genes for both models was identical which is indicative of an assembly anomaly. because the two models were found in opposite orientations of one another it is possible that scaffold chr <dig>  itself was assembled in the wrong orientation. in some cases gaps in the genomic sequence made it impossible to annotate a complete gene and therefore some of the sequences are incomplete . specifically, sequences were incomplete due to gaps adjacent to the coding region , gaps within the coding region  or because the gene was situated at the end of a scaffold . also, sequences coding for additional srcr domains were found both outside and within the coding regions of putative wc <dig> genes and were predicted to be either pseudogenes  or part of intronic sequence based on the presence of premature stop codons or frameshifts that resulted in premature stop codons. nevertheless, the data presented here support the existence of a large family of genes, with three distinct structures, coding for individual wc <dig> molecules in ruminants.

deduced amino acid sequences of the  <dig> annotated wc <dig> genes described here were aligned and shown compared with the archetypal wc <dig> sequence . genes are grouped according to their distinct gene structure  and it is evident that genes of a particular type have sequence similarity. however, despite wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig> having different types of gene structures their extracellular regions are very similar although differences within their intracytoplasmic tail regions occur as would be expected since wc1- <dig> has an extra exon. when wc <dig> gene distribution on chromosome  <dig> was evaluated it was found that their relatedness based on type did not correlate entirely with their genomic location .

cdna evidence for wc <dig> distinct gene structures
mrna derived from bovine pbmc was analyzed to confirm the transcription of the multiple genes annotated above. to verify that cdna sequences  obtained were indeed representative of multiple genes, instead of genetic variation among animals, all reactions were performed using mrna from a single animal. also, because wc1+ γδt cells with different wc <dig> molecular forms respond to different activation stimuli  <cit> , reactions were performed with pooled cdna from cona-activated, leptospira-activated and ex vivo pbmc in order to maximize the number of wc <dig> transcripts amplified.

analysis of pcr products showed that primer combinations  used to amplify full-length wc <dig> yielded two bands of approximately  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb for primer pairs wc1atg-for/wc1group <dig> -rev and wc1atg-for/wc1group4-rev and approximately  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb for primer pair wc1atg-for/wc1group3-rev. sequencing revealed that the larger bands of approximately  <dig>  kb were most frequently full-length wc <dig> of type i and ii while the  <dig>  kb was most frequently full-length type iii. however, on occasion some transcripts in these bands were found to be alternatively spliced. the smaller sized bands of approximately  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb contained transcripts that always represented alternative splicing and are described further below. sequence alignments were generated based on the deduced amino acid sequences from representative cdna clones and annotated wc <dig> genes and percent identities were calculated based on those alignments . because the sequences varied in length due to either incomplete genomic sequence availability or alternative splice variation, sequences were aligned in a pairwise manner and were truncated so that comparisons were made only between regions that were common to both sequences. archetypal wc <dig> sequence  was compared to both the annotated wc <dig> gene sequences as well as the cdna sequences generated as part of this study. this analysis revealed that while primer pairs wc1atg-for/wc1group <dig> -rev and wc1atg-for/wc1group4-rev amplified the same transcripts, primer pair wc1atg-for/wc1group3-rev specifically amplified cdna whose sequence represented type iii genes and thus was most similar to swine wc <dig> . this also demonstrated that cdna evidence was available for many of the predicted genes including ones representing each of the three types including wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig> as type i, wc1- <dig> as type ii and wc1- <dig> as type iii.

a percent identity is shown for the deduced amino acid sequences of wc <dig> genes and cdna clones.

b bold values indicate cdna clones classified as wc <dig> genes.

domain  <dig> is the most variable srcr domain
when we compared individual wc <dig> srcr domains using cdna and annotated genomic sequences by aligning deduced amino acid sequences we found the greatest variability among domain 1's, with percent identities as low as  <dig> % . there was less variability among the other domains with domain 9's sharing the most identity ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . classification of wc <dig> cdna clones described here, based on exon-intron structure and on sequence identity to annotated wc <dig> sequences, is reported in table  <dig> based on the following reasoning. in many cases sequence identity of ≥ 98%, based on comparison of full-length sequence as described in table  <dig>  was sufficient to classify cdna sequences: ch <dig> as wc1- <dig>  ch <dig> as wc1- <dig>  ch <dig> as wc1- <dig> and ch <dig> as wc1- <dig>  in every case, except for ch <dig>  additional wc <dig> genes shared > 90% identity with classified cdna sequences.

a sequences used for analysis included wc <dig> genomic sequences and cdna sequences. for each domain, all sequences were compared and redundant sequences were removed from the analysis.

a nd  denotes a cdna sequence for which a genomic equivalent gene has not been identified.

in other cases classification required refinement. that is, because domain 1's were found to be the most variable domain, cdna and genomic sequences coding for domain 1's were aligned  and used to generate a phylogram . only non-redundant sequences were included in the analysis and included those described here as type ii , type iii  and type i . these were useful in classifying cdna sequences with regard to the annotated sequences. while we found when comparing full-length sequences that ch <dig> was  <dig> % identical to wc1- <dig>  its domain  <dig> sequence is most identical to wc1- <dig> and was therefore classified as such. conversely, ch <dig> was  <dig> % identical to wc1- <dig> but was classified here as wc1- <dig>  because no wc1- <dig> domain  <dig> sequence is currently available for comparison. likewise, ch <dig> was found to be  <dig> % identical to wc1- <dig> but was not classified as such due to lack of domain  <dig> sequence and is instead designated as wc1-nd <dig>  ch <dig> was the only complete cdna clone for which no related genomic wc <dig> was identified out of a total of  <dig> sequences evaluated. therefore our findings indicate that differing wc <dig> molecular forms are based on germline sequences and are not a result of domain-exon rearrangements among individual wc <dig> genes as occurs for t cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes. the sequence for wc1-nd <dig> is likely to occur in the assembly gaps and suggests at least one additional wc <dig> gene.

domain  <dig> comparisons also provided evidence for transcription of two more genes. ch <dig> and ch <dig> domain  <dig> sequences  corresponded to those of the genes designated wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig>  respectively, for which corresponding full-length transcripts were not found above. since the relationship between other cdna and genomic sequences seen in table  <dig> were largely maintained when just domain  <dig> sequences were compared here , this is reasonable evidence for transcription of wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig>  finally, one domain  <dig> cdna sequence, ch <dig>  lacked genomic corresponding sequence and thus was named wc1-nd <dig> and suggests a fifteenth wc <dig> gene.

the phylogram generated based on domain  <dig> sequences  demonstrated that although the genes differ in their exon-intron structures, there was not a similarly clear distinction between the genes when just their domain 1's were evaluated. however, these data do confirm findings shown in table  <dig> indicating that domain  <dig> is the most variable domain. this is most notable when seen in contrast with a multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino acid domain  <dig> sequences  and its subsequent phylogram . domain  <dig> was found to be the least variable of the  <dig> wc <dig> srcr domains and this is reflected in the phylogenetic analysis. it is possible that, if domain  <dig> is indeed the ligand binding region, selective pressures that drive domain  <dig> variability would not necessarily apply to the other srcr domains.

intracytoplasmic region analysis and classification
it could be reasoned that the most divergent of the  <dig> wc <dig> srcr domains, i.e. domain  <dig> as shown above, would be the ligand binding region of the wc <dig> co-receptor and thus that the wc <dig> domain  <dig> sequence associated with a particular γδt cell could influence its response to various stimuli. however, it is also possible that variation in the intracytoplasmic tail regions of wc <dig> could convey signaling differences which would influence the outcome of receptor ligation. this is supported by previous observations regarding the tail function  <cit> . therefore, comparisons of wc <dig> intracytoplasmic region cdna sequences with genomic intracytoplasmic sequences were done.

the alignment  and resulting phylogram  confirmed that tail sequences clustered according to their exon-intron structure . that is, wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig> and ch <dig> clustered and are representative of the type ii wc <dig> molecular forms and, with the exception of wc1- <dig> which is type iii, all other wc <dig> genomic and cdna sequences in the various other clusters are classified as type i. one cdna clone included in those  contained archetypal wc <dig>  sequence with a premature stop in the intracytoplasmic domain which should not affect tyrosine phosphorylation based on its location  <cit> ; this sequence had been previously independently obtained as well  <cit> . for type iii, wc1- <dig> clustered with ch <dig> and their tail sequences were found to be most similar to swine wc <dig> supporting evidence described above for this unique type. to confirm this relatedness, swine wc <dig> sequences were included for comparison. there are five publicly available sequences for swine wc <dig> including one unique domain  <dig> sequence and two unique intracytoplasmic tail sequences . here we demonstrated bovine wc1- <dig> intracytoplasmic tail sequence is more closely related to swwc1-29e <dig> than to any other bovine wc <dig> intracytoplasmic tail region. however, the intracytoplasmic region of wc1- <dig>  and its corresponding cdna clone ch <dig>  is strikingly longer than that of the other bovine wc <dig> genes and contains additional sequence  that is not found even in swine wc <dig>  overall, the relationships established by comparing wc <dig> domain  <dig> sequences  were largely maintained by the comparisons of tail sequences. however, some wc <dig> molecules, such as wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig>  have highly similar extracellular domains suggesting that they may bind the same ligand, but they differ in their tail structures, as illustrated in figure 9b. this suggests that cells bearing wc1- <dig> or wc1- <dig> might differ in their functional responses .

evidence for isoform generation
as mentioned above, rt-pcr products for wc <dig> transcripts yielded bands of approximately  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb in addition to the larger bands that most commonly contained full-length sequence. when the smaller bands were sequenced they were found to represent alternative splice variants. all  <dig> wc <dig> cdna sequences obtained in this study are shown schematically with alternative splice variants aligned with non-spliced sequences to indicate the missing domains  providing evidence of isoform generation. interestingly, on some occasions the larger bands were also found to contain transcripts representing alternative splice variants that lacked the transmembrane region and/or a single srcr domain . spliced cdna sequences were designated as a particular wc <dig> if the existing deduced amino acid sequence shared ≥ 98% identity with the corresponding full-length wc <dig> sequence.

there was no apparent pattern to wc <dig> splicing. it was most common for entire srcr domains to be missing, though in one case  half of a domain was missing but it still appeared to result in a viable transcript. most often five contiguous srcr domains were missing so that the resulting transcript contained six srcr domains; however, transcripts lacking anywhere from one to six full srcr domains were identified. wc <dig> transcripts lacking the transmembrane regions  were also identified as otherwise full-length wc <dig> sequences as well as for wc <dig> splice variants lacking either four or five srcr domains. while two wc <dig> cdna sequences  have shorter intracytoplasmic domains due to premature stop codons, there was no evidence of alternative splicing within the intracytoplasmic domain.

discussion
to better characterize the bovine wc <dig> co-receptor family we annotated the wc <dig> genes in the bovine genome btau_ <dig>  assembly and identified  <dig> wc <dig> genes distributed between two loci on chromosome  <dig>  this included a novel wc <dig> gene that more closely resembles swine wc <dig> than it does previously identified ruminant wc <dig> genes. work is ongoing to resolve the gaps in the genome assembly of chromosome  <dig>  however, the number of wc <dig> genes in the multi-gene family agrees reasonably well with previous reports estimating the occurrence of many related wc <dig> genes based on southern blots  <cit>  and of  <dig> wc <dig> genes based on cdna analysis of intracytoplasmic tail region transcripts  <cit>  but is fewer than the  <dig> wc <dig> genes predicted for sheep by southern blotting  <cit> . the distribution of wc <dig> genes between two loci is reminiscent of the two tcr gamma loci for cattle and sheep  where it is predicted that a number of duplication events and a subsequent translocation event resulted in the formation of the trg <dig> locus  <cit> . it is possible that similar events contributed to the formation of the wc <dig> loci because the distribution of wc <dig> genes based on sequence similarity does not support the idea that a single wc <dig> locus underwent duplication. also, interestingly, the distribution of the three distinct exon-intron structures identified here for the wc <dig> genes  among the two loci also does not support locus duplication alone because the type ii and iii genes are found only within a single locus.

we verified the gene annotations by amplifying and sequencing wc <dig> cdna from bovine cells derived from a single animal. cdna evidence confirmed the presence of at least a single functional gene, in an individual animal, for each of the three types of genes differentiated by their exon-intron structure. it is important to note that the profile of wc <dig> transcripts obtained from this individual animal is not necessarily representative of all wc <dig> genes expressed. this is despite using an experimental design in which cdna from several conditions was pooled prior to pcr as well as using a variety of primers in an attempt to avoid biased amplification of particular wc <dig> transcripts. with regard to this, it was notable that transcripts representative of archetypal wc <dig> , the only full-length sequence previously published  <cit> , were not found to be abundant, to the extent that it was necessary to design a separate primer to preferentially amplify archetypal wc <dig>  transcripts. nevertheless, we confirmed the presence of  <dig> out of  <dig> wc <dig> genes based on cdna sequences that corresponded to genomic sequences while cdna evidence for wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig> was not found. . although all cdna transcript sequences varied to some extent from corresponding genomic sequences, variations found between cdna and related genomic sequences are most likely attributable to variation between animals due to single nucleotide polymorphisms. indeed, even within a single animal there was preliminary evidence of allelic polymorphism . only two wc <dig> sequences derived from rt-pcr, ch <dig> and ch <dig>  lacked any corresponding genomic sequence and were assigned the gene names of wc1-nd <dig> and wc1-nd <dig>  respectively. the identification of a cdna sequence lacking a corresponding genomic sequence could be a consequence of a gap in the genome sequence thus necessarily precluding the annotation of the corresponding gene. there is also evidence for copy number variation of wc <dig> genes among animals  and this would also account for the observed differences.

prior to these studies wc <dig> sequence corresponding to swine wc <dig> had not been identified in ruminants. the bovine swine-like wc1- <dig> reported here is structurally similar to wc <dig> in swine containing  <dig> srcr domains, a transmembrane region and a long intracytoplasmic tail. it has been suggested that swine wc <dig> is the primitive version of its ruminant ortholog  <cit> , so it could also be reasoned that in bovine wc1- <dig> is the most primitive of the ruminant wc <dig> genes. however, interestingly, the bovine wc1- <dig> has a very long intracytoplasmic region while swine wc <dig> genes have intracytoplasmic regions that are approximately the same length as those of the more classical bovine wc <dig> genes despite much dissimilarity in sequence  <cit> . current evidence for the classical bovine wc <dig> intracytoplasmic tails indicates that both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation is important for activation signals and endocytosis, respectively  <cit> . it is possible that the presence of a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation motif within the unique portion of bovine wc1- <dig> intracytoplasmic region could result in a signaling and/or functional role that is distinct from other wc <dig> genes.

with regard to this, wijngaard and co-workers identified and designated three distinct wc <dig> gene products as wc <dig> , wc <dig>  and wc <dig>  based on reactivity with specific mabs using wc1-transfected cells  <cit> . based on those studies, wc <dig> bearing γδt cells were subsequently defined based on mab reactivity as wc <dig> +, wc <dig> +, wc <dig> +/wc <dig> + or wc <dig> +/wc <dig> + wherein the wc <dig> + population is only found as a subpopulation of wc <dig> + cells. while the sequence for wc <dig>  has been reported in its entirety, only limited putative amino acid sequence for domains  <dig> and  <dig> and nucleotide sequence for segments of the intracytoplasmic tails for wc <dig>  and wc <dig>  have been reported. wc <dig>  was unique with regard to its long intracytoplasmic tail  <cit>  and that sequence can be found to correspond to type ii wc <dig> tail sequences here. however, based on our annotations no wc <dig> gene was identified that had the sequence reported by wijngaard et al.  <cit>  as that corresponding to domain  <dig> of wc <dig> ; in fact similar sequence was instead found in domain  <dig> of wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig>  and thus we suggest part of the published wc <dig>  sequence is erroneous. despite this problem it has already been shown that functionally distinct subpopulations of bovine γδt cells can be defined based on the presence of particular wc <dig> molecules that react with monoclonal antibodies recognizing wc <dig>  or wc <dig>   <cit>  and we now know that wc <dig> intracytoplasmic tails corresponding to the archetypal wc <dig>  sequence play a critical role in signal transduction in response to antigen  <cit> . thus, it is important to further evaluate the role of the long intracytoplasmic tail regions contained in type ii genes wc1-  <dig>  wc1- <dig>  wc1- <dig> and the swine-like type iii gene wc1- <dig>  because domain  <dig> is the most diverse among wc <dig> srcr domains, as shown here, it is possible that it serves as the pattern recognition portion of the wc <dig> molecule and could be a region where bacterial products are ligated as occurs for dmbt <dig>  <cit> . therefore, pairings of particular wc <dig> domain 1's with particular intracytoplasmic tail regions may be crucial to directing γδt cell responses and functions. future studies will be targeted towards better understanding those relationships. for instance, transfection experiments with wc1- <dig> and wc1- <dig> would enable us to determine whether they bind the same ligands but their intracytoplasmic tails send different signals and thus result in differing functional responses.

finally, the occurrence of a large variety of bovine wc <dig> molecules can be explained only in part by the number of wc <dig> genes since here we report evidence for extensive alternative splicing of bovine wc <dig> transcripts. in fact, all but one of the expressed wc <dig> genes we identified had corresponding splice variants. immunoprecipitation of γδt cell membranes with anti-wc <dig> mab results in a variety of bands including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda  <cit> , lending support to the occurrence of multiple isoforms and/or swine-like wc1- <dig> on γδt cells. while the possibility remains that what appear to be alternative splice variants are instead genes that were not identified during the annotation process as a result of gaps in the genomic sequence, all but two alternative splice variants can be related to unspliced transcript sequences that are ≥ 98% identical. moreover, previous reports indicate that swine and sheep wc <dig> orthologs  <cit>  as well as other srcr family immune system molecules  produce transcripts that are alternatively spliced  <cit> . however, interestingly, unlike for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> , wc <dig> intracytoplasmic tail length appears to be dictated by the particular gene encoding a transcript and not by alternative splicing.

it is notable that domain  <dig>  the putative ligand-binding portion, was never found to be missing as a result of alternative splicing. while this could be an artifact due to primer design, the forward primer was designed to anneal in the leader sequence and thus that explanation is unlikely. precedence for multiple isoforms of a t cell co-receptor is shown by the two cd4-like genes in fish which differ from each other structurally  <cit> . the function of these smaller wc <dig> molecules with apparently intact domain 1's and intracytoplasmic tails is unknown but intriguing. because wc <dig> serves as a co-receptor on γδt cells, smaller wc <dig> molecules may be better able to co-cluster in the immune synapse with the shorter tcr chains . it is also possible that wc <dig> isoforms differ in their flexibility given that full-length wc <dig> molecules contain inter-domain or "hinge" regions following srcr domains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and this could affect interaction with the tcr. differences in flexibility have been noted for functionally different immunoglobulin heavy chains with ige and igm lacking hinge regions. it is yet to be determined whether transcripts of the same gene but with different alternative splice variants are found expressed by an individual cell but perhaps wc <dig> splicing is initiated following interaction with its ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
based on annotations of the bovine genome we identified  <dig> members of the wc <dig> gene family and their organization within two loci. many of those genes had not been previously described, including a gene coding for a putatively more primitive and smaller swine-like wc <dig> molecule. furthermore, we provide cdna evidence as verification for many of the annotated sequences as well as evidence for isoforms derived by alternative splicing and the suggestion of at least two more wc <dig> genes. it is possible that wc <dig> diversity contributes to functional differences that have been observed between γδt cell subpopulations and here we have demonstrated that diversity of wc <dig> molecules is attributable to a large, multi-gene family as well as to the fact that wc <dig> transcripts undergo extensive alternative splicing.
