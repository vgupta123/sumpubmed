BACKGROUND
salinity stress negatively affects the quality and quantity of crop production. rice is considered to be a salt-sensitive crop, and excess salt levels adversely affect all the major metabolic activities, causing cell wall damage, cytoplasmic lysis or genomic instability
 <cit> . in order to cope with salt stress, plants have evolved high degrees of developmental plasticity, including adaptation via cascades of molecular networks
 <cit>  and changes in gene expression profiles
 <cit> . post-transcriptional regulation also plays an important role in the plant response to salinity conditions
 <cit> .

the micrornas  are a large family of endogenous, non-coding, small rnas  that were demonstrated to play crucial roles in the modulation of gene expression
 <cit> . plant mirnas originate from hairpin precursors  after two sequential cleavages performed by dicer-like <dig> . mature mirnas are then incorporated into the risc complex  and negatively regulate the expression of specific mrna targets through mrna cleavage, decay or translational repression by base-pairing with its targets
 <cit> . the first mirna  discovered in  <dig> was reported to be involved in the regulation of caenorhabditis elegans larval development
 <cit> . since then, an increasing interest has been devoted for the study of mirnas both in animals and plants. after the first identification of mirnas in arabidopis <cit> , a great number of plant mirnas have been identified by computational means
 <cit> . many mirna genes are conserved in rice and arabidopsis, indicating that their origin forfeit the divergence between monocotiledonate and dicotiledonate plants. in plants, mirnas generally interact with their targets through near-perfect complementarity and leads to target mrna cleavage. the high degree of sequence complementarity between mirnas and their target mrnas allowed the prediction of targets using algorithms that scan the genome for mrna-mirna complementarity
 <cit> . however, the predicted targets must be experimentally validated in order to confirm their function.

plant mirnas have been predicted or confirmed to regulate a wide variety of developmental and physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, plant development, signal transduction, stress response and pathogen invasion
 <cit> . recent findings have demonstrated that many plant mirnas can be induced by biotic or abiotic stress and they may play an important role in the process of adaptation to adverse environmental conditions
 <cit> . for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were up-regulated in response to water deficit in medicago truncatula <cit> , mir <dig> was found to be strongly up-regulated by cold, dehydration, nacl and aba treatments, while mir389a proven to be down-regulated in response to these treatments in arabidopsis plants
 <cit> . in vitis vinifera, mir171e was demonstrated to be involved in the resistance to blight while the arabidopsis mir <dig> was induced by low-phosphorus, and mir <dig> and mir <dig> are uv-b-responsive
 <cit> .

in rice, a set of mirnas that putatively control different helicase genes were recently identified by in silico analysis
 <cit> . helicases are enzymes that catalize the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. among helicases, the dead-box family is by far the largest family and it is characterized by the presence of nine conserved motifs that were demonstrated to be involved in the atpase and helicase activities
 <cit> . helicases are implicated in a wide range of processes such as recombination, replication and translation initiation, double-strand break repair, maintenance of telomere length, nucleotide excision repair, cell division and proliferation
 <cit> . recent reports indicate that the expression of genes encoding helicases is also regulated in response to changes in specific environmental conditions, including temperature, light, oxygen or osmolarity
 <cit> . for example, the ectopical expression of pdh <dig>  helicase, a member of the dead-box protein family, resulted into salinity stress tolerance both in tobacco and rice plants
 <cit> . pdh <dig> gene was shown to confer high salinity stress tolerance also in bacteria 
 <cit> .

in the present study, the expression profiles of osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir164e along with their targeted genes, were investigated in relation with the early response to salinity stress. the present mirnas were predicted to target the putative helicases osabp , osdshct  and osdbh  included in the dead-box family. no information concerning the activity of these helicases are currently available in plants. an in silico characterization of the proteins was performed and the mirnas predicted targets were validated by rlm-5′race. wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> gene were used in the present study in order to assess if there are differences between sensitive and tolerant rice plants to early salinity stress conditions.

methods
plant materials and treatments
rice  cultivar ir <dig> was used in the present study. transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> gene, as well as the empty vector control were raised as previously described
 <cit> . seeds were sowed in pots containing a mixture of vermiculite, sand, and peat moss in 1:1: <dig> ratio and kept under greenhouse conditions  for two weeks. in order to test the early response to salt stress, rice plants were dipped in  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl solution for  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively.

leaf disk assay

proline estimation
proline was determined according to previously described procedure
 <cit> . plant material  from 14-days old untreated and treated plants were extracted with 3% aqueous 5-sulphosalicylic acid and filtered through whatman no.  <dig> filter paper. glacial acetic acid and acid ninhydrine was added to the resulting supernatant and heated at 100°c for 1h. after the reaction was terminated, toluene was added. the toluene layer was then separated and the red color intensity was measured at 520nm. the assays were done in triplicates using corrected weight calculated for the actual moisture content of tissue at each treatment
 <cit> . proline content was expressed as mg proline per g of fresh weight.

rna extraction and cdna synthesis
total rna was extracted from whole plant by using trizol reagent  according to manufacturer’s instructions. a total quantity of  <dig> mg plant tissue was used. the rna samples were treated with rnase-free dnasei  to eliminate dna contamination. the rna quantification was performed using the picogene spectrophotometer . the absorbance ratios of the rna samples at 260/ <dig> nm and 260/ <dig> nm were between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the quality of rna samples was verified on 1% agarose gel. cdna synthesis was performed using two different strategies. in order to study the expression levels of osabp, osdbh and osdshct genes, cdna was synthesized by using the accuscript high fidelity 1st strand cdna synthesis kit , according to manufacturer’s instructions. as for the mirnas expression level, cdna was obtained by using the ncode™ vilo™ mirna cdna synthesis kit  as instructed by the supplier.

microrna validation through 5′ rna ligase mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends
in order to get the cleavage transcripts, a modified procedure for rna ligase-mediated 5′ race was performed using the firstchoice rlm-race kit . total rna  from two weeks old rice plants, was ligated to 5′ race adaptor without calf intestine alkaline phosphatase treatment. the gene-specific outer primers were then used for cdna synthesis. initial pcr was carried out using the 5′ race outer primer and gene-specific outer primer. nested pcr was then carried out using 1/ <dig> of the initial pcr reaction, with the 5′ race inner primer and gene specific inner primer. the sequences of the gene-specific primers are shown in table

quantitative real-time pcr
qrt-pcr reactions were performed in a  <dig> real time pcr system apparatus . for the osabp, osdbh and osdshct gene expression, qrt-pcr primers were design by using the genescript primer design program  . the primer pairs were design to amplify a region containing the cleavage site of osa-mimi <dig>  osa-mir168e and osa-mir <dig>  respectively. predicted fragment size ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. the α-tubulin gene was used as endogenous control. the homogeneity of α-tubulin gene expression under normal and salinity stress conditions was previously tested
 <cit> . brilliant iii ultra-fast sybr green qpcr master mix  was used for qrt-pcr reaction as indicated by the supplier. the amplification conditions were as follows: initial incubation step at 95°c for  <dig> min, denaturation step at 95°c for  <dig> s, annealing step at 57°c for  <dig> s and extension step at 72°c for  <dig> s, for  <dig> cycles. fluorescence data was collected during the extension step and the specificity of qrt-pcr products was confirmed by performing a melting temperature analysis at temperatures ranging from 55°c to 95°c in intervals of  <dig> °c. pcr fragments were run in a  <dig> % agarose gel to confirm the existence of a unique band with the expected size.

RESULTS
salinity stress induces modifications in chlorophyll content and proline levels in rice plants
in order to study the salt stress effects on wild type , empty vector control  and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> gene , two different nacl concentrations  were used. the rice plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for two weeks and subsequently submitted to salt stress treatments. when leaf discs were floated separately on  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> h, the damage caused by salt stress was evident from the degree of bleaching observed in the leaf tissues . chlorophyll estimation was performed to confirm the leaf disc assay results. when the  <dig> mm nacl solution was used, reduction in total chlorophyll content in the wt , ev  and tr  plants, compared to the non-treated controls, was observed . as for the treatment with  <dig> mm nacl, the decrease in total chlorophyll content was even higher, resulting in  <dig> -fold reduction in the case of wt plants,  <dig> -fold for ev and  <dig> -fold for tr plants.

the free proline content was also quantified, considering that this compound is a well-known osmoprotectant. the estimated free proline content in the untreated control samples was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g fw in wt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g fw in ev and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g fw in tr plants. at  <dig> h after treatment, no significant changes in proline levels were observed . the exposure of rice plants to salt stress for  <dig> h resulted into a significant  accumulation in free proline since the  <dig> mm nacl solution induced a  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold increase in the wt, ev and tr plants, compared to the untreated control . a further increase in the amount of free proline was observed using the  <dig> mm nacl treatments. the estimated free proline content was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g fw  in wt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g fw  in ev and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g fw  in tr plants.

the reported data show that the loss of chlorophyll induced by salinity stress was lower in tr rice plants compared to wt plants while the free proline content was slightly higher in the transgenic lines compared with the wild type plants.

prediction of osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir164e targets and experimental validation
the computational mirna target searches were performed on the psrna target analysis server . from the bioinformatic search it was evident that the osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir164e possess multiple predicted targets. the mirnas with their sequences, predicted targets and accession numbers are presented in table
 <dig>  umate and tuteja 
 <cit>  predicted that osa-mir <dig> targeted six different helicases: the atp-dependent rna helicase ddx <dig> and ddx <dig>  the pre-mrna-processing atp-dependent rna helicase prp <dig>  the rna helicase a , an atp-dependent helicase required to maintain repression  and the atp-binding protein . the only predicted target that showed 100% sequence complementarity with osa-mir <dig> was osabp. the predicted targets for osa-mir <dig> were dshct , mip <dig>  and a basic blue copper protein . the osa-mir164e was predicted to target two different mrnas: a dead-box helicase  and a member of the nac  gene family.

to determine if the mirnas can direct cleavage of their predicted helicase targets, a modified 5′ rapid amplification of cdna ends  protocol was performed. this technique has been used to validate mirna targets as cleavage occurs opposite to around the tenth position from the 5′-end of the mirna
 <cit> . the results presented in figure
 <dig> indicate that the 5′-race analysis could clearly identify the mirna-mrna cleavage for the osa-mir <dig> target osabp, the osa-mir <dig> target osdshct and the osa-mir164e target osdbh in the canonical 10th-11th positions.

osabp, osdbh and osdshct are putatively dead-box helicases
no information on osabp, osdbh and osdshct are currently available. their helicase activity was not yet validated. the only information available come form bioinformatic approaches. the osabp , osdbh  and osdshct  nucleotide and amino acid sequences were obtained from the rice genome annotation project funded by nsf. the osabp gene contains an open reading frame  of  <dig> nt, encoding a protein of  <dig> aa, osdbh possesses an orf of  <dig> nt that encodes for a protein of  <dig> aa, while osdshct is characterised by an orf  encoding a protein of  <dig> aa. the search for protein domains, carried out using the cdd software from ncbi, revealed the presence of the dead and helicase c-terminal domains in all the three sequences . the dead domain, specific to the dead-like helicase superfamily, contains several atp-binding sites and it is involved in atp-dependent rna or dna unwinding. the helicase superfamily c-terminal domain is associated with dexd-, dead- and deah-box proteins. this domain is found in a wide variety of helicases and helicase related proteins and it is characterized by the presence of a p-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases. members of the p-loop ntpase domain superfamily are defined by a conserved nucleotide phosphate-binding motif, also referred as walker a and walker b motif that bind the beta-gamma phosphate moiety of the bound nucleotides and the mg2+ cation
 <cit> .

additionally, the osdshct protein included a rna-processing arch domain and the duf1181/nuc <dig> domain . the rna-processing arch domain, specific to dob <dig> and ski <dig> helicases, is required for the proper processing of  <dig> s rrna and it appears to function independently of canonical helicase activity
 <cit> . the duf1181/nuc <dig> domain is also found in dob1/sk12/hely-like dead box helicases, involved in 3′ end formation of rrna and mrna transport
 <cit> .

comparison of amino acid sequences was performed using the ncbi blastp service . the rice osabp protein shared 48% similarity with the a. thaliana dead-box atp-dependent rna helicase  <dig>  and approximately 50% similarity with the glicyne max  and vitis vinifera  proteins. the osdbh protein revealed 50% similarity with the atp-dependent dna helicase q-like 5-like form a. thaliana  and 53% similarity with the proteins from g. max  and v. vinifera . as for the osdshct protein, 75% and 80% similarity to the a. thaliana  and v. vinifera  rna helicase dob1/ski <dig> proteins was observed.

expression profiles of osabp, osdbh and osdshct genes in response to early salinity stress
the expression profiles of osabp, osdbh and osdshct genes were evaluated in two weeks-old rice plantlets subjected to  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl treatments in order to determine the early response  to salt stress conditions. the investigation was carried out using the wild type rice cultivar ir <dig>  and the empty vector control  that were compared with transgenic plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> helicase . the tr plants, previously demonstrated to be tolerant to salinity stress, were used to estimate the potential differences between the mrna levels of the osabp, osdbh and osdshct genes. the results of the qrt-pcr analysis are shown in figure
 <dig>  all the tested genes were significantly  up-regulated in response to treatments.

the osabp gene was highly up-regulated at  <dig> h after treatment when  <dig> mm nacl was used. the wt and ev plants showed  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold up-regulation, while in the tr plants the observed up-regulation of the osabp gene was only  <dig> -fold. at  <dig> h after treatment the level of osabp mrna level decreased in the tr plants, compared to controls. when the  <dig> mm nacl concentration was used, a change in the expression profile was observed. at  <dig> h after treatment only a slight increase  in the osabp mrna levels was detected, while at  <dig> h the highest expression level  was evidenced in tr plants .

when the osdbh gene was analysed, the  <dig> mm nacl treatment induced a slight increase in the transcript levels at  <dig> h following treatment was detected in all the tested samples while a consistent accumulation was evident in wt and ev plants at  <dig> h . the tr plants revealed only a  <dig> -fold increase in the osdbh transcript level. when the  <dig> mm nacl solution was used, the highest transcript accumulation was observed at  <dig> h after treatment in wt and ev plants , while after  <dig> h the osdbh transcript levels decreased . the tr plants showed similar expression patterns  at both time points .

as for the expression levels of the osdshct gene, the  <dig> mm nacl treatment induced a  <dig> -fold increase in the transcript level in wt plants at  <dig> h after treatment and only  <dig> -fold increase in tr plants. at  <dig> h after treatment, the amount of osdshct mrna decreased in wt plants  and slightly increased in the tr plants . when the  <dig> mm nacl solution was used, only a slight accumulation in the transcript level was observed both at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  in all the tested samples .

the reported data show enhanced accumulation of the osabp, osdbh and osdshct gene transcripts in wt plants, with the exception of the osabp mrna that peaked in tr plants treated with  <dig> mm nacl.

expression analysis of osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir164e under salinity stress
salinity treatments also affected the expression of the mirnas in rice plants. the results of the qrt-pcr analysis are shown in figure
 <dig>  osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir164e and osa-mir <dig> were significantly  down-regulated in response to salinity stress.

the expression of osa-mir <dig> significantly decreased  in wt and ev plants at  <dig> h after treatment with  <dig> mm nacl while in tr plants, only a  <dig> -fold decrease was observed under the same conditions. at  <dig> h after treatments, a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold decrease in the amount of osa-mir <dig> was observed in wt and tr plants, respectively. exposure to  <dig> mm nacl caused a decrease of approximately  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in the level of osa-mir <dig> transcript after  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively, while in the tr plants the observed reduction was around  <dig> -fold .

in the case of osa-mir164e expression, the use of the  <dig> mm nacl solution resulted into  <dig> -fold decrease at  <dig> h after treatment and  <dig> -fold decrease at  <dig> h after treatment. in the tr plants the estimated decrease of osa-mir164e transcript was approximately  <dig> -fold. when  <dig> mm nacl treatment was used, a  <dig> -fold decrease was measured in wt plants at  <dig> h after treatment, while at  <dig> h after treatment the wt, er and tr plants showed a similar expression level, with a  <dig> -fold reduction compared to the control .

as for the osa-mir <dig> expression, the amount of mrna decreased  in wt, ev and tr plants at  <dig> h after treatment with both the  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl solutions. in this case the transcript levels were similar in wt, ev and tr plants also at  <dig> h after treatment, when a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold reduction was evidenced in response to  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl, respectively .

although salinity treatment affected the expression of all tested mirnas, the reported changes in mirna levels were small.

discussions
in the present study, transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> gene , were tested under early-induced salinity stress conditions and compared with the wild type rice genotype ir <dig>  and the empty vector control . the tr plants are resistant to salinity stress and represent a valid system for testing the genes and mirnas expression patters in comparison with the wt plants. the short-term response to salinity stress may be particularly relevant to better understand the biological significance of stress status in plant responses to salinity.

a preliminary characterization of the stress response in rice was carried out by measuring the chlorophyll content and the free proline levels. the damage caused by salt stress was evident from the degree of bleaching observed in the leaf tissues, along with a decrease in chlorophyll content. however, the reduction in chlorophyll content was significantly higher in wt plants, compared with tr plants. since the goal of this study was to test the plant response to early-induced salinity stress, the free proline levels were measured at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-treatment. significant increase in free proline was observed in response to both nacl concentrations  at  <dig> h after treatment. the tr plants were able to accumulate higher amounts of free proline compared with the wt. this finding is in agreement with the recent study on rice plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> gene, where the authors demonstrated that the plants were tolerant to salinity stress
 <cit> .

the role of mirnas as important players in the plant stress response has been highlighted in recent years, opening new intriguing perspectives for crop improvement.

the main goal of the present work was to assess the role of three different rice mirnas, osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir164e and osa-mir <dig>  as regulators of genes encoding dead-box helicases in response to salinity stress. the mirna hereby investigated have been described in a previous work
 <cit>  where an in silico analysis was used to identify a set of mirnas involved in the regulation of rice helicases expression. a modified rlm -5′race protocol was used to validate osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir164e, and osa-mir <dig> predicted targets and our results clearly demonstrate that osa-mir <dig> targets the osabp mrna, osa-mir <dig> targets osdshct and osa-mir164e targets the osdbh mrna sequence, cleaving them in the canonical 10th-11th positions. in plants, there are only few reports concerning mirnas that target specific helicase genes. in a recent study it demonstrated that the dcl <dig> helicase domain, targeted by mir <dig>  is responsible for the atp-dependence of mirna processing, suggesting that this helicase domain is critical for mirna biogenesis
 <cit> . besides the osabp, osdbh and osdshct dead-box helicase genes, other predicted targets of the above cited mirnas have been reported, as shown in table
 <dig>  some of these targets were already validated while others still need to be studied. out of the six helicase that were predicted to be targets of osa-mir <dig>  only the osabp protein was experimentally validated in this study. in the case of osa-mir <dig>  the predicted target corresponding to a plastocyanin-like protein has been previously validated in arabidposis <cit>  and medicago truncatula <cit> . other mir <dig> targets include some members of major intrinsic proteins  involved in plant osmoregulation, drought resistance, salt tolerance and seed germination
 <cit> . in this case, the computational predicted target was not yet validated. as for osa-mir <dig>  the subset of the arabidopsis nac-domain transcription factor genes that include the cup-shaped cotyledon  genes were already validate as targets
 <cit> . the nac-domain genes are required for organ separation. when mir <dig> was ectopically expressed in arabidopsis plants, it resulted into floral organ fusion and cotyledon fusion
 <cit> .

no information regarding the activity of osabp, osdbh and osdshct helicases are currently available in plants. in consequence, a thorough bioinformatic investigation was carried out to analyze and compare in detail the structural features of the osabp, osdbh and osdshct proteins. the three proteins harbour the dead domain and the helicase c-terminal domain, typically conserved motifs found in helicase superfamily. the similarity search showed that osabp and osdbh were close to rna helicase  <dig> and dna helicase recql <dig>  respectively, while the osdshct revealed high similarity with the ski2/dob <dig> protein. rna helicase  <dig> is a member of the dead-box family, possessing atp-dependent helicase activity and rna-binding property
 <cit> . the recq helicases have been shown to play important roles in dna repair, recombination and replication, consistent with their intrinsic dna helicase activities
 <cit> . recently it was proved that the recql <dig> helicase promotes genome stabilization through interaction with rna polymerase ii
 <cit> . the ski/dob <dig> proteins are essential atp-dependent rna helicases that play crucial roles in ribosome synthesis and the degradation of cytoplasmic mrnas following poly 
 <cit> . a recent report on osabp revealed that the gene is up-regulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments including nacl, dehydration, aba, blue and red light
 <cit> . although a large number of dead box proteins were identified by in silico analysis as putative predicted helicases, the confirmation of helicase activity was demonstrated only for few of them
 <cit> . in plants, two dead-box-related helicases termed pdh <dig> and pdh <dig> were proven to be induced by a variety of abiotic stresses including salinity, cold, heat and aba treatments, suggesting that they are components of a general stress response mechanism
 <cit> . recently, a single subunit of minichromosome maintenance  <dig>  from pea was reported to function as dna helicase and to promote salinity stress tolerance without affecting yield
 <cit> . nonetheless the few references, genes encoding helicases were proven to be induced in response to salinity stress
 <cit> .

the stress-responsive gene expression results in metabolites accumulation, alteration of biochemical and physiological pathways, vital for the plant adaptation to stress conditions
 <cit> . in the present study, qrt-pcr analysis showed that the osabp, osdbh and osdshct genes are up-regulated in response to salinity stress in both wt and tr plants. however, a higher accumulation of the gene transcripts was observed in wt plants, except for the osabp transcript that showed the highest level in tr plants treated with  <dig> mm nacl. the differences observed between the experimental conditions and the control might be due to changes in transcriptional activity. however, some differences might result from the action of mirnas
 <cit> . the effects of mirna directed mrna degradation can be detectable through changes in the expression profiles of mirna targeted genes. our results shown that osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir164e and osa-mir <dig> were down-regulated in wt and tr rice plants challenged with salinity stress. considering the fact that the targeted helicases were up-regulated and the mirnas were down-regulated in relation to early-induced salt stress, we can state that the negative correlation between these mirnas and their validated targets is certified. the levels of accumulation or decrease in the transcript levels is most visible in the case of tr plants, where the  <dig> -fold decrease in the osa-mir <dig> expression resulted into  <dig> -fold up-regulation of osabp gene.

several recent papers have described the mirnas involvement in the response to various stress conditions
 <cit> . mir <dig> was shown to accumulate at low levels in plants under standard conditions and its accumulation was highly induced by drought and heavy-metals
 <cit> . since mirnas can be targeted by more than one gene, a recent study demonstrated that ago <dig> and ago <dig> could act redundantly in the mir408-mediated plastocyanin regulation
 <cit> . the arabidopsis mir <dig> family comprises three members, mir164a, mir164b and mir164c, which negatively regulate several genes that encode nac-like transcription factors
 <cit> . in the present study, osa-mir164e was identified and its target, a dead-box helicase, validated. both osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir164e are responsive to early salinity stress conditions. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were proven to be responsive also to cold and drought conditions in euphorbiaceae plants
 <cit> . several mirnas that displayed different activities during salt stress were recently identified in zea mais <cit> . the authors shown that mir <dig> was down-regulated after  <dig> h of salt shock, while its target nac <dig>  was up-regulated. a similar study showed that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> along with their target genes, were differentially expressed in stress-tolerant maize hybrids compared with stress-sensitive lines
 <cit> . as for osa-mir <dig>  no other information was available in the literature. it was predicted to target six different helicases in rice plants
 <cit> , we validated the osabp gene as one of its targets and shown the changes in their expression profiles under early salt stress conditions. however, further analysis is still needed in order to better characterize the mirnas involvement in salinity stress as well as the function of their validated targets.

CONCLUSIONS
osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir164e and osa-mir <dig> were experimentally validated for the first time in plants as targeting the osabp, osdbh and osdshct genes. osabp, osdbh and osdshct represent newly identified dead-box helicases in rice. their function still needs to be experimentally validated. the expression profiles of the mirnas and their validated targets were tested under early-induced salinity stress conditions both in wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the pdh <dig> helicase. our data showed that that the genes were up-regulated and the mirnas were down-regulated in relation to salt stress. the negative correlation between the mirnas and their targets was proven. the present results also highlights higher accumulation of the gene transcripts in wt plants when compared with tr plant, correlated with decrease in the mirnas expression.
