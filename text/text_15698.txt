BACKGROUND
flavonols constitute a major class of plant natural products that accumulate in a wide range of conjugate structures. a large proportion of this diversity is due to the attachment of one or several sugar moieties at different positions. besides providing beautiful pigmentation in flowers, fruits, seeds, and leaves  <cit> , flavonoids also have key roles in signalling between plants and microbes, in male fertility of some species  <cit> , in defence as antimicrobial agents and feeding deterrents  <cit> , in uv protection  <cit> , in the regulation of polar transport of auxins  <cit> , and more recently, their role in cell cycle regulation in plants has been demonstrated  <cit> . there is increasing evidence to suggest that flavonoids, in particular those belonging to the class of flavonols , are potentially health-protecting components in the human diet as a result of their high antioxidant capacity  <cit> . therefore, flavonoids may offer protection against major diseases such as coronary heart diseases and cancer  <cit> . flavonoids are present at relatively high concentrations in saffron, the dessicated stigma tissue of c. sativus  <cit> . their antioxidant properties, along with their bitter taste, could qualify them as potential organoleptic agents of the spice  <cit> . in addition, they show anticonceptive and anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> . nevertheless, the studies of these compounds in saffron stigma are scarce, and have only been analysed with some detail in tepals  <cit> .

flavonoid synthesis is organ- and tissue-dependent, and is affected by environmental conditions  <cit> . in the early steps of flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine derived from the shikimic acid pathway is converted to coumaroyl-coa by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate:coa ligase. chalcone synthase, the first committed enzyme for flavonoid biosynthesis, results in the condensation of coumaroyl-coa with three molecules of malonyl-coa from acetyl-coa to form naringenin chalcone, which suffers further modifications that result in the synthesis of substitute flavones, flavonols, catechins, deoxyflavonoids, and anthocyanins. the flavonoid aglycones, which have a variety of glycosylation sites, are converted into glycon by glycosyltransferases.

in higher plants, secondary metabolites are often converted to their glycoconjugates, which are then accumulated and compartmentalized in vacuoles  <cit> , while glycosylation of phytochemicals is known to alter their regulatory properties by causing enhanced water solubility and lower chemical reactivity. glycosylation involves a ugt-catalysed transfer of a nucleotide diphosphate-activated sugar molecule to the acceptor aglycone  <cit> . the glycosylation reactions are catalysed by glycosyltransferases . among these gtases, family  <dig> gtases , commonly utilize small molecular weight compounds as acceptor molecule substrates and udp-sugars as donors  <cit> . the first gene encoding a plant glycosyltransferase was isolated in zea mays, during the analysis of the bronze locus, which codes for an udp-glucose:flavonol glucosyltransferase  <cit> . since then, several clones have been characterized at a molecular level in a range of species including petunia hybrida  <cit> , vitis vinifera  <cit> , perilla frutescens  <cit> , allium cepa  <cit> , nicotiana tabacum  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , dianthus caryophyllus  <cit> , beta vulgaris  <cit> , glycine max  <cit> ; pyrus communis  <cit> , oryza sativa  <cit>  and fragaria Ã— ananassa  <cit>  among others.

here the isolation of a udp-glucose:flavonol glucosyltransferase from c. sativus stigmas using a degenerate pcr technique is reported. the substrate specificity analyses using recombinant protein indicated that c. sativus flavonol gt, csgt <dig>  was able to catalyse glucosylation of kaempferol and quercetin. interestingly, csgt <dig> was not expressed in crocus species unable to accumulate kaempferol 7-o-glucosides in stigmas, suggesting the involvement of csgt <dig> in the formation of kaempferol glucosides in the stigma tissue of c. sativus.

RESULTS
profile of flavonols accumulation during stigma tissue development
in saffron, the flavonoids kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside-7-o-glucopyranoside and kaempferol 7-o-sophoroside were identified as abundant compounds  <cit> , and more recently, a kaempferol tetrahexoside and kaempferol  <dig> ,4'-triglucoside have been tentatively identified as minor flavonoids in saffron  <cit> , whereas quercetin and its glucosides have not been detected. initially the content of flavonoids present in c. sativus stigma at anthesis was analysed by lc-esi-ms . in addition, six stigma developmental stages were selected and methanol extracts were analysed by hplc. under our experimental conditions, three significant flavonoids were evident in the hplc chromatograms from extracts of c. sativus stigmas . the retention times, the uv spectra and the lc-esi-ms analysis on stigmas at anthesis allowed us to tentatively identify these flavonoids as 3-o-sophoroside-7-o-glucopyranoside,  <dig> ,4'-triglucoside and 7-o-sophoroside . this compound was also characterized by nmr analysis and the obtained structural data correspond to those found in the literature  <cit> . the presence of all three flavonoids increased with stigma development and the increase for the two kaempferol triglucosides was equal. the relative levels of kaempferol 7-o-sophoroside, which reached the maximum levels at anthesis, were much higher than those observed for both kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside-7-o-glucopyranoside and kaempferol  <dig> ,4'-triglucoside, with relative high levels in the scarlet stages  .

cloning and deduced structure of csgt45
to identify flavonoid glucosyltransferases from c. sativus stigmas, a homology-based strategy was used, taking advantage of specific glycosyltranferase motifs located in the c-terminus region  <cit> . a cdna population was prepared by reverse transcription of poly + from total rna isolated from c. sativus stigmas at anthesis, which showed the highest levels of kaempferol glucosides. dna fragments were amplified by degenerate primers and the obtained products were cloned and analysed. sequencing of one pcr product revealed homology to glycosyltransferases. the sequence information from this clone, csgt <dig>  allowed the design of pcr specific primers to obtain the full-length transcripts. we performed 5' and 3' race using poly+ from c. sativus stigma as a template. the gtase gene obtained  was intronless, containing a putative open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> .

because c. sativus is a triploid, we employed in silico screening of a large stigma cdna est database  <cit>  as an effective method for identification of potential csgt <dig> alleles. we identified three est clones with 98% identity in  <dig> bp , 98% identity in  <dig> bp  and 84% identity in  <dig> bp . the first two ests correspond to csgt <dig>  and the third could correspond to a csgt <dig> allele.

the carboxyl terminal of the protein contained the plant secondary product glycosyltransferase  box signature motif. analysis of csgt <dig> sequence for n-terminal targeting signal or c- terminal membrane anchor signal using signalp and tmpred web-based programmes predicted csgt <dig> to be non-secretory with an absence of predicted signal peptides or transmembrane signals  <cit> .

for comparative modelling, csgt <dig> was aligned with mtugt71g <dig>  whose crystal structure has recently been solved  <cit> . csgt <dig> displayed 18% overall identity with mtugt71g <dig> . a molecular model of csgt <dig> was constructed from the structural alignment. structurally conserved regions of the csgt <dig> model were built from the crystal structure of mtugt71g <dig> using the pyre server  <cit>  . in plant gts, the most common sugar donor is udp-glc. several conserved residues, most of which are found in the pspg motif of plant ugts, interact with the sugar donor  <cit> . the conserved residues involved in the interaction with udp-glucose in mtugt71g <dig> are also conserved in csgt <dig>  with the exception of the e <dig> residue that in csgt <dig> is aspartate residue d <dig>  which is also found in the characterized vvgt <dig>  <cit> .

comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with that of other glycosyltransferases reveals overall positional identities of 44% with pyrus communis flavonoid 7-o-glucosyltransferase , 41% with arabidospis flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase  and flavonoid 7-o-glucosyltransferase ntf7gt . the phylogenetic tree based on deduced amino acid sequences if plant gtases is shown in figure  <dig>  currently, gtases function and specificity cannot be fully predicted based on sequence information alone. however, the phylogenetic tree of functionally characterized gtases showed several clusters, which could be characterized by the specificity of the flavonoid glycosyltransferase activities of enzymes involved therein. cluster i is characterized by flavonoid 3-o-glycosyltransferases, cluster iii mainly contains flavonoid 7-o-glycosyltransferases, and cluster iv contains broad substrate gtases. cs45gt is included in cluster ii, which contains anthocyanin 5-o-glucosyltransferases , like vha5gt, pfa5gt and pha5gt which activities have been tested in vitro  <cit>  and other gtases with a broad substrate specificity that are not involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, like ugt74f <dig> and ugt74f <dig> from arabidopsis, which produced distinct multiple glucosides of quercetin in vitro  <cit> , while in vivo act as anthranilate glycosyltransferases  <cit>  and gtases implicated in salicylic acid metabolism, like ntsalgt that reacts on several phenolic compounds in vitro  <cit> . ntf7gt from nicotiana that reacts on the 7-hydroxyl group of flavonol and 3-hydroxyl group of coumarin  <cit>  and pcf7gt from pyrus communis that reacts on the 7-hydroxyl group of flavonol  <cit> . therefore, csgt <dig> was presumed to encode a flavonoid gtase in c. sativus stigmas and was subjected to further analyses.

biochemical characterization
to identify the function of csgt <dig>  the full-length open reading frame was cloned into the expression vector pgex-5t- <dig> for heterologous protein expression in e. coli. the recombinant protein was affinity purified on a glutathion sepharose column that binds the protein's n-terminal gst-tag . due to its homology with other flavonoid glycosyltransferases, csgt <dig> was expected to glucosylate flavonoids. activity tests were performed with udp-glucose and the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol . csgt <dig> forms monoglucosides on the 7- hydroxyl group of kaempferol , whereas over quercetin forms monoglucosides on the 7-, 3'-, and 4'-hydroxyl groups of quercetin . glucosylation positions of the kaempferol and quercetin reaction products were assigned based on the hypsochromic shift data  <cit> , comparison with published data  <cit>  and when available, using authentic reference compounds. flavonols have two absorption maxima: band i  and band ii  corresponding to the b- and a-ring, respectively. conjugation of 3-, 5-, or 4'-hydroxyl groups causes a band i hypsochromic shift, which is larger for a 3-substitution  than a 4'-conjugation . the maximum absorbances of kaempferol were  <dig> and  <dig>  and those of the kaempferol reaction product were  <dig> and  <dig> nm. the lack of a hypsochromic shift between substrate and reaction product strongly suggests that glycosylation occurred at the hydroxyl group of c- <dig>  which was confirmed by comparison with an authentic reference standard . for quercetin  only the product p <dig>  did not show a hypsochromic shift  suggesting conjugation at the 7-hydroxyl group. p <dig>  showed a band i hypsochromic shift of  <dig> nm suggesting conjugation at the 4'-hydroxyl group, which was confirmed by comparison with an authentic reference standard . the product p <dig>  was tentatively assigned to quercetin 3'-o-glucoside based on comparison of related flavonoid product elution profiles  <cit> , and by the lack of coincidence with the quercetin 3-o-glucoside standard regarding spectral data and elution time . when longer incubation times  and higher substrate concentration  of kaempferol or quercetin were used the formation of one diglucoside was observed for each flavonoid . other compounds, i.e. trans-cinnamic acid, sinapic acid, crocin, iaa and abscisic acid were assayed, but no activity was detected with any of these substrates. the results obtained suggest that csgt <dig> acts on flavonols in vivo. the kinetic parameters for the individual glucosides formed were determined at variable concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol. the kcat and km values are described in table  <dig>  the vmax/km ratios clearly demonstrate that csgt <dig> exhibits the highest specificity towards 7-oh of kaempferol , followed by the 7-oh and 4'-oh of quercetin , and low affinity toward the 3'-oh .

enzyme assays were carried out using purified csgt <dig> , substrate  and udp-glucose . reactions mixtures were incubated at 30Â°c, and performed in triplicate.

the kinetic constants for udp-glucose were also calculated. different concentrations of udp-glucose were assayed keeping the level of kaempferol constant. udp-glucose showed a km of  <dig>  mm and a vmax of  <dig>  nkat/mg, thus suggesting that glucose is a good substrate for csgt <dig> 

spatial and developmental expression
the spatial and temporal expression pattern of csgt <dig> was studied by rt-pcr throughout stigma development. analyses were performed with rna isolated from different stages of stigma development, i.e. flowers containing yellow, orange and red stigmas, which are characterized by the presence of immature anthers, and small tepals that do not show the characteristic purple coloration of c. sativus. these immature flowers are contained inside perianth tubes that elongate as flowers develop inside. only when flowers are completely developed do they emerge from the perianth tubes and open when anthesis  occurs a few days later. upon emerging, all flowers exhibited purple tepals and scarlet stigmas . the rt-pcr analysis revealed that csgt <dig> expression is developmentally regulated. the csgt <dig> transcript level in the yellow and orange stages was low, but increased from the red stage, and reached a peak at anthesis . the expression of the csgt <dig> was also examined in different tissues. the expression in flower tissues showed that csgt <dig> transcripts were present in pollen, tepals and styles at low levels whereas expression in corms was practically undetectable under these conditions .

the high expression levels of csgt <dig> transcripts in the stigma tissue and its in vitro activity suggested that csgt <dig> was associated with the observed kaempferol glucosylation in the stigma tissue. to investigate further such correlation the expression levels of csgt <dig> were investigated in the stigma tissue of crocus species in which kaempferol with substitutions in the 7-oh position were not detected . these three crocus species showed reduced flavonoid levels in comparison with c. sativus. in c. niveus we were unable could to detect kaempferol glucosides, in c. speciosus and c. cancellatus  a kaempferol treahexoside was identified at position  <dig> . this compound, substituted at position  <dig>  has been also identified in c. sativus as a minor flavonoid  <cit> . the expression of csgt <dig> was not detected in the stigma tissue of c. niveus, c. speciosus and c. cancellatus , while was present in the stigma tissue of c. sativus and c. cartwrightianus that accumulate kaempferol with substitutions in the 7-oh position . by contrast, the expression of ugtcs <dig>  a gtase previously identified in c. sativus stigmas  <cit>  was detected in all the species . the absence of csgt <dig> expression in the stigma tissue of of c. niveus, c. speciosus and c. cancellatus suggests a role of csgt <dig> in the accumulation of specific kaempferol glucosides in the stigma of crocus species.

unaltered expression of csgt <dig> under stress conditions
several studies have shown that gtases are induced by a variety of stresses, including: salicylic acid  <cit> , auxin  <cit> , methyl jasmonate  <cit>  and wounding  <cit> . to determine whether the gene expression levels of csgt <dig> were influenced by exogenous hormones or by other stimuli such as drought stress and wounding, total rna was isolated from treated leaves and used as template in the rt-pcr reactions. the expression of the gene was not altered  <dig> hours after the treatments . shorter times were also tested with the same results . exogenous ja, aba, ga <dig>  or  <dig> d did not significantly promote the expression of the genes . drought, wounding and sa failed to affect the expression levels of csgt <dig> .

discussion
in general, gtases that use secondary metabolites as substrates are minor constituents in plant cells  <cit> . although many of these enzymes have been isolated from several plant species and assayed in vitro, in many cases their roles in the secondary metabolism of these plants are still unknown.

the saffron csgt <dig> protein belongs to glucosyltransferase family  <dig>  as do most of the ugts involved in plant secondary metabolism. this protein possessed a pspg box with a conserved sequence of  <dig> amino acid residues and showed specificity towards flavonoid aglycones. this protein has no signal sequence, nor any clear membrane-spanning or targeting signals, as the plant glycosyltransferases identified to date  <cit> . this suggests that these enzymes function in the cytosol, although within that compartment the proteins may associate as peripheral components of the endomembrane system, as previously suggested  <cit> . sequence analysis showed csgt <dig> as being most closely related to the pyrus communis flavonoid 7-o-glucosyltransferase and belonging to the same clade of the phylogenetic tree, in which other glucosyltransferases of flavonoids attach sugars without high regiospecificity. the presence in this clade of a5gt enzymes suggest a common ancestral gene for all these gtases, where the a5gts enzymes showed a strict substrate specificity  <cit> , and seem to have evolved to a more specific function.

plant secondary product glycosyltransferases have been reported to exhibit a rather strict regioselectivity towards the position of the sugar attachment  <cit> . the most common site on the flavonol molecule for glycosyl addition is carbon  <dig> of the c-ring, although other sites, especially the hydroxyl at carbon  <dig>  are often substitutes  <cit> . however, in proportion, there are few studies on the enzyme activity and genes implicated in the catalysis of the 7-o-glucoside reaction. many plant gtases recognize quercetin as an acceptor when assayed in vitro, and some others can glucosylate multiple hydroxyl groups of the aglycone and even form diglucosides in some cases  <cit> . in arabidopsis, from ninety one gtases analyzed for their activity toward quercetin,  <dig> enzymes showed catalytic activity, and four recognize three sites  <cit> . analysing the activity of some enzymes related to csgt <dig>  the arabidopsis enzyme ugt74f <dig>  glycosylated the 3'-oh, 4'-oh and 7-oh positions of quercetin  <cit> . we have observed similar activity for csgt <dig> toward quercetin, but with a preference for the 7-oh position . however, csgt <dig> showed high regioselectivity toward kaempferol, and the same was reported for ntgt <dig>  <cit> , present in the csgt <dig> cluster. this feature is characteristic for several 7-o-glucosyltransferases present in cluster iii and iv and distantly related to csgt <dig>  <cit> . the km value of kaempferol with csgt <dig> is  <dig>  Î¼m, indicating its sufficient affinity to the substrate. these km values were the same as other plant gtases reported  <cit> , suggesting that these substrates are reasonable acceptors for csgt <dig>  moreover, the csgt <dig> enzyme did not react on other ohs of kaempferol, indicating that in this case the regiospecificity of the glucosylation is strictly determined. it has recently been reported that the hydroxylation pattern in ring b of the acceptor molecule can influence product specificity. ugt73a <dig> from beta vulgaris accepts the positions 4' and  <dig> of flavonols. if a hydroxy group is present at position 3' , 4'-o-glucosides are preferentially formed. if the hydroxy group is missing , the enzyme produced 7-o-glucosides  <cit> . perhaps the differences observed for csgt <dig> towards quercetin or kaempferol are due to this fact.

because quercetin and kaempferol are substrates for csgt <dig> in vitro, it is reasonable to propose that this enzyme is involved in the glucosylation of phenolics in the stigma tissue. analysis of the flavonoid fraction from saffron revealed the unique presence of kaempferol  <cit> . the gene expression pattern of csgt <dig> correlates with high levels of kaempferol glucosides in the stigma tissue. interestingly the three main flavonoid glycosides detected in the stigma at anthesis were kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside-7-o-glucopyranoside, kaempferol  <dig> ,4'-triglucoside and kaempferol 7-o-sophoroside. csgt <dig> was found to be active on the c- <dig> position of kaempferol, with the production of a monoglucoside and probably a diglucoside under the experimental conditions tested. since kaempferol-7-o-sophoroside was the main flavonoid in the stigma tissue, we can speculate whether csgt <dig> uses udp-sophoroside as a sugar donor. however, udp-glc does appear to be a good donor and the sugar donor preference of a specific gt is often very narrow, showing little or no activity with alternative sugars  <cit> . by using a molecular modelling approach, we observed that csgt <dig> and mtugt71g <dig> share higher structural similarity, indicative of similar binding modes with sugar donors. in addition, the residues that interact with the udp-glc molecule were conserved in csgt <dig>  to our knowledge, no gtase has been shown to use udp-sophoroside as a sugar donor. furthermore, the bright blue or red flowers in the japanese morning glory  contain anthocyanidin 3-o-sophoroside derivatives, and the udp-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-o-glucoside-2"-o-glucosyltransferase  enzyme mediates the glucosylation of anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosides to yield anthocyanidin 3-o-sophorosides, whereas another glucosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of a glucose molecule to the  <dig> position  <cit> . thus, most probably csgt <dig> is responsible for the production of kaempferol 7-o-glucoside and another ggt could be responsible for the generation of kaempferol 7-o-sophoroside.

the absence of csgt <dig> activity toward the c- <dig> or the c-4' positions of kaempferol indicates that other glucosyltransferases are implicated in the flavonoid glucosylation in c. sativus stigma. in fact, enzymes that catalyzed the transfer of glycosyl groups to the flavonol c- <dig> position are included in a different cluster than csgt <dig> 

the increase of flavonoids in the stigma tissue could be associated with the role of flavonoids in protection against abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . the ultra-violet -absorbing characteristics of flavonoids have long been considered to be evidence for the role of flavonoids in uv protection. the mechanism of protection by flavonoids could be suppression of free radicals formed upon exposure to uv light  <cit> . flavonoids are often present in the epidermal cell layers of leaves and in tissues that are susceptible to uv light, such as pollen and the apical meristem  <cit> . in c. sativus the flavonoid levels are specially high in scarlet stigmas  that are characterized for being exposed to sunlight, whereas the stigmas for earlier developmental stages are under the soil and enclosed inside the perianth tubes, and therefore protected from the light.

another well-documented property of flavonoids is their antimicrobial effect  <cit> . high levels of kaempferol are even reported to inhibit the growth of viruses  <cit> . the mechanism of kaempferol toxicity is not known, but kaempferol can promote radical formation that might interfere with vital functions of pathogens  <cit> . the stigma appears to offer a hostile environment to bacteria and fungi since growth of these organisms on the stigma is rare  <cit> . the presence of flavonoids in the stigma tissue could be associated with the protection of stigmas from pathogen attack.

in addition to these possible functions of flavonoids in the stigma of c. sativus, flavonoids are also involved in the control of polar auxin transport  <cit> , which determines plant organ morphology, such as leaf and flower shape  <cit> . in flowers, stigma and style growth is due to cell elongation, but not to cell division. the transition from the red stage of stigma development in c. sativus to the fully developed stigma  is accompanied by a rapid increase in size. when the stigmas of c. sativus are fully developed they are slender at the base and wider at the apex where they fold to give a trumpet-like structure  <cit> . the typical morphology of c. sativus stigmas could be the result of different auxin distribution controlled by flavonoid signals.

expression analysis showed low levels of csgt <dig> in tepals. the tepals of c. sativus are characterized by high levels of anthocyanins, up to 90% of total flavonoids  <cit> . nevertheless, a total of nine quercetin and kaempferol glycosides have been identified in minor amounts in c. sativus tepals, and a flavonoid-7-o-glucosyltransferase was predicted to be responsible for the formation of two of them  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have determined the role of csgt <dig> in the transfer of glucose on 7-oh of flavonoids, together with its implication in the generation of c. sativus flavonoids in the stigma tissue. c. sativus stigmas are mainly used for culinary purposes, and historically have been employed in many medicinal drugs against numerous health conditions  <cit> . flavonoids have long been known to be important nutraceutical components in our diet, due to their potent anti-oxidant properties  <cit> , with glycosylation as a major mechanism influencing their activity. therefore, the characterization of glucosyltransferases implicated in the formation of these compounds in c. sativus will help to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of these glucosides and their implications in the nutraceutical properties of saffron.
