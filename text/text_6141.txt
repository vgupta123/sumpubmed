BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal tract moves a large amount of fluid, quantitatively second only to that of the kidney. in man, about  <dig> l/day of water  are absorbed, and about 1- <dig> l/day are secreted with enteric juice  <cit> . like the kidney, the intestine can also contribute to water homeostasis maintenance by modulating water  absorption and secretion  <cit> . transporting epithelia offer two pathways for water and solute flows: 1) the paracellular route, consisting of junctional complexes and lateral intercellular spaces; 2) the transcellular route, consisting the apical and basolateral cell membranes  <cit> . these routes are not completely independent, since the lateral intercellular spaces may provide a compartment in which the transport pathways may communicate  <cit> . transcellular water transport may occur by several mechanisms but, in the last decade, a special attention has been paid to the role of aqps, which allow rapid and substantial bi-directional movement of fluid  <cit> . indeed, eight different aqps have been identified and partially characterized in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals  <cit> .

aquaporin- <dig>  was first identified in the kidney of the rat . in the rat, aqp <dig> gene localizes to chromosome  <dig> locus 7q <dig>  where it is composed of four exons and three introns. the predicted amino acid sequence contained one consensus site for n-linked glycosylation at asn- <dig> and one for phosphorylation at ser- <dig>  <cit> . expression of aqp <dig> in xenopus laevis oocytes shows low water permeability   <cit>  which rapidly increases up to ten fold with hg2+ treatment, unlike other aqps  <cit> . acidic ph  also increases the pf of aqp <dig> oocytes  <cit> . this activation of aqp <dig> water permeability is accompanied by an increased ion conductance with the following halide permeability sequence: no3->i->>br->cl->>so42-  <cit> . thus, differently from other mammalian orthologs aqps, aqp <dig> seems to function primarily as an anion-selective channel rather than as a water channel. moreover, a careful analysis of aqp sequences alignment and mutation experiments demonstrated that the single substitution of the asn- <dig> with a gly residue eliminates the anion permeability and greatly enhances the osmotic water permeability  <cit> . whereas most known aqps are localized on the plasma membrane , aqp <dig> in the kidney is localized almost solely in intracellular vesicles   <cit> . immunogold studies revealed that aqp <dig> is colocalized with h+-atpase in intracellular vesicles of the intercalated cells of renal collecting ducts  <cit> . recently, aqp <dig> was also found in the cerebellum, close to the tight junctions, in secretory granule membranes of parotid acinar cells, and in the apical portion of inner ear supporting cells  <cit> , but its expression in the gastrointestinal tissue has been not investigated yet.

in the present study, we investigate whether aqp <dig> is expressed in several regions of the rat gastrointestinal tract and then define the localization of aqp <dig> protein, from stomach to rectum, under the hypothesis that it could be involved in physiological mechanisms of fluid movement, acid base regulation and/or anion transport. the expression of aqp <dig> mrna and protein in different portions of the rat gastrointestinal tract was studied by rt-pcr and immunoblotting, and the cellular and subcellular localization of mrna and protein by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. subsequently, the small intestine expression of aqp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mrna was investigated in relation to feeding. this study provides evidence for the expression of aqp <dig> at the apical side of superficial cells of both small and large intestine and to a minor extent in gastric principal and parietal cells. moreover, the upregulation of aqp <dig> by feeding in the small intestine suggests its direct involvement in the absorption of water and anions.

RESULTS
rt-pcr analysis of aq <dig> mrna expression in rat gastrointestinal tract
we investigated the expression and distribution of aqp <dig> mrna in different portions of rat gastrointestinal tract by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. the expression of aqp <dig> was normalized using β-actin as internal standard. single bands of the size expected for cdna fragments were amplified . the results of agarose gel electrophoresis of representative pcr reaction products are shown in fig.  <dig>  negative controls of rt-pcr experiments were always performed by omitting reverse transcriptase . the specificity of the amplified cdnas was confirmed by sequencing pcr products. the nucleotide sequence of pcr products was identical to the published sequence for rat aqp <dig> . aqp <dig> mrna was expressed in all the portions of the rat gastrointestinal tract, although expression levels varied between samples . densitometric analysis of the bands showed that aqp <dig> transcript was significantly higher in the small intestine  and in the rectum than in the large intestine . the values , expressed as aqp/β-actin densitometric percentage ratio, were:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ;  <dig> * ±  <dig>  ;  <dig> * ±  <dig>  ;  <dig> §. ±  <dig>  ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ;  <dig> § ±  <dig>  . *, p <  <dig>  vs. caecum, proximal colon, distal colon and stomach; §, p <  <dig>  vs. proximal colon and distal colon .

immunoblotting analysis of the aqp <dig> protein in rat gastrointestinal tract
total membrane fractions from rat gastrointestinal tract portions and small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles  fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting with affinity purified antibodies against rat aqp <dig>  the antibody was preliminary tested on immunoblots of membranes isolated from x. laevis oocytes injected with aqp <dig> crna according to yasui et al.  <cit> . the results revealed two main bands  on immunoblots of membranes from aqp <dig> oocytes , consistent with published data  <cit> , while non-injected oocytes were negative . specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by preabsorption experiments performed with total membrane homogenates from rat stomach and kidney  and by incubating the blots with pre-immune rabbit serum. in both cases the aqp <dig> protein bands  were completely ablated . aqp <dig> immunoblots showed a major band of about  <dig> kda  in all gastrointestinal tract portions investigated as well as in the kidney . when homogenates were pre-treated at 37°c, bands of  <dig> and  <dig> kda were also observed . as resulted from deglycosylation experiments, the  <dig> and  <dig> kda bands represent the non-glycosylated and glycosylated aqp <dig> monomer forms, respectively . the band of  <dig> kda may represent an aqp <dig> dimer, as already reported  <cit> .

aqp <dig> distribution along the gastrointestinal tract showed highest expression in the stomach followed by caecum, rectum, large and small intestine. to determine whether aqp <dig> protein is present in intracellular vesicles, as shown in the kidney  <cit>  and/or in plasma membranes, enriched bbmv fractions from rat small intestine were analyzed by immunoblot. an intense signal for aqp <dig> protein was detected in bbmv preparations, consistent with an apical membrane location of the aquaporin .

in situ hybridization
to study the distribution and localization of aqp <dig> in the gastrointestinal tract we utilized in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry techniques in a combined approach.

our aqp <dig> probe was preliminarily tested on kidney sections to verify its specificity and hybridization conditions. as previously reported  <cit> , labelling was observed in type a intercalated cells of the collecting ducts in the inner and outer medulla  , and at lower levels in the cortical region, and no labelling was detected in henle's loop and vessels, as well as in negative control sections .

aqp <dig> transcript was observed in all gastrointestinal segments tested. in the stomach, labelling was found in the isthmus, neck and basal region of glands but almost absent in mucous pit cells . in jejunum, aqp <dig> transcript was detected homogeneously in both crypt and villus epithelial cells . the hybridization pattern observed in the colon was similar to jejunum, with labelling distributed in both crypt and surface cells . the specificity of hybridization labelling was demonstrated by the low background observed on control sections .

immunohistochemistry
the localization of aqp <dig> was investigated by immunohistochemistry. preliminarily, the antibody was tested in kidney sections. as previously reported  <cit> , an intense labelling was observed the intercalated cells of renal collecting ducts . control sections incubated with pre-immune serum were negative . in the stomach labelling was observed in the isthmus, neck and basal regions of glands . an intense labelling was also observed in mucous neck cells , which are thought to represent undifferentiated  cells, and lower signal was also observed in chief cells and some parietal cells . aqp <dig> immunoreactivity appeared to be confined to intracellular structures. controls in which the pre-immune serum was used in place of the primary antibody display no labelling . these results agree with those obtained by rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and immunoblotting.

immunohistochemical analysis of small intestine showed that aqp <dig> protein was detected in the superficial epithelial cells of the jejunal mucosa ; similar results were observed also in the duodenum and ileum .

differently from results of in situ hybridization experiments, an intense labelling for aqp <dig> protein was shown in the cells of the upper part of the villus while it was reduced or absent in the crypt . at higher magnification, it was possible to note that aqp <dig> expression was more intense at the brush border membranes of the epithelial cells, even if an intracellular staining was also present . this is in agreement with immunoblotting results obtained with bbmv preparation . no staining was observed at the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells  nor in goblet cells, resulting in a periodically interrupted immunostaining pattern . aqp <dig> labelling was absent when the primary antibody was substituted by pre-immune serum  or when a preadsorbed, affinity purified anti-aqp <dig> antibody was used .

in the proximal colon an intense labelling was observed in the superficial epithelial cells; the intensity of aqp <dig> immunostaining decreased from the surface towards the base of the crypt . no labelling was detectable in the intercalated goblet cells . at high magnification, the epithelial cells of the proximal colon showed strong aqp- <dig> immunostaining of the apical membranes but an intracellular signal was also observed . immmunolabelled controls were negative .

similar results were observed also in the caecum, distal colon and rectum .

meal-induced modulation of aqps expression in rat jejunal mucosa
the expression of aqp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mrna was investigated by quantitative real time rt-pcr  in rat jejunal mucosa under fasting and fed conditions. results showed that feeding significantly increases aqp <dig> mrna expression of about 5-fold . no significant changes were observed for aqp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  transcripts under these conditions, while aqp <dig> was dramatically decreased in feeding condition of about 16-fold. aqp <dig> up-regulation by feeding was also demonstrated at protein level by immunoblotting. as shown in fig. 5b, aqp <dig> protein in jejunal mucosa from fed rats was twice as much as that measured in fasting rats.

discussion
this study extensively examines the presence, distribution and function of aqp <dig>  at both mrna and protein levels, in rat gastrointestinal tract. aqp <dig> was demonstrated, characterized and extensively studied in the α-intercalated cells of the renal collecting duct  <cit> . recent studies demonstrate aqp <dig> expression in extra renal tissues such as the cerebellum, parotids, and inner ear endorgans  <cit> . the results presented here show for the first time that aqp <dig> is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract . rt-pcr experiments reveal that aqp <dig> transcript is significantly higher in the small intestine and in the rectum than in the other portion of the gastrointestinal tract . immunoblotting analysis of crude gastrointestinal tissue homogenates and bbmv preparations show that aqp <dig> protein expression is higher in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine . as suggested by immunohistochemistry , the small intestine aqp <dig> immunoreactivity is concentrated in the apical membrane domain . the specificity of the reaction was tested on immunoblots of membranes isolated from aqp <dig> oocytes , by preadsorbing the antibody with a  <dig> fold molar excess of immunizing peptide  or by incubating the blots with pre-immune-serum . the aqp <dig> protein bands were similar to those previously obtained from kidney homogenates  <cit> , although the major band observed here was the  <dig> kda  and only occasionally the monomeric form at  <dig> kda .

the combined analysis of aqp <dig> mrna and protein were made to strengthen the results of localization experiments. except for the stomach, aqp <dig> mrna and protein have different patterns of distribution within the gut wall. while mrna abundance is homogeneous, protein labelling increases from the crypt toward the villus tip. the presence of aqp <dig> transcript in the crypt cells and lower part of the villus suggests that the gene is transcribed early in the differentiation of epithelial cells, while the protein is present almost exclusively in the mature epithelial cells of the villus tip. discrepancy between mrna and protein expression has been observed in the small and large intestine also for aqp <dig> ) <cit> .

in the stomach, aqp <dig> mrna is present in the isthmus, neck and basal region, as observed by in situ hybridization experiments. the results by immunohistochemistry show a strong aqp <dig> immunolabelling in the isthmus and neck regions and a weak signal in some parietal cells dispersed throughout the glands and in the zymogenic cells at the base of the gland .

based on available data, besides aqp <dig> only aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> are present in the stomach, both at the basolateral side of the cells  <cit> . nevertheless, the cellular and subcellular localization of aqp <dig> cannot support its involvement in gastric juice secretion.

indeed, the intense labelling of mnc appeared located in intracellular vesicles  . this restrictive localization of aqp <dig> in the cytoplasm of mnc in close association with small secretory granules was similar to that previously shown for aqp <dig> in the renal epithelia  <cit> , and for aqp <dig> in the membrane of the granular vesicles of gastroenteropancreatic endocrine cells of the small intestine  <cit> .

apart from the well known capacity of the mnc to secrete mucus, the functions of this cell lineage are still obscure. three possible functions were hypothesized: i) mnc could be undifferentiated  cells,  <cit> ; ii) mnc could secrete several peptides involved in both mucosal protection and repairing  <cit> ; iii) mnc could contain pepsinogen a and c granules  <cit> . however, independently from these hypotheses the common characteristic of these cells is the secretory function. thus, aqp <dig> expression in the membrane of the mnc secretory granules may be involved in osmotic water movement associated with the exocytotic process. moreover, the lower aqp <dig> expression observed in mature chief and parietal cells  could indirectly prove the stem cell function of mnc. indeed, aqp <dig> may be expressed as an early gene in a developmental stage of the mnc that undergoes gene repression: this stage corresponds to the differentiation process of this cell lineage culminating in the phenotype of the fully functional mature zymogenic and parietal cells. another important finding of this study is that aqp <dig> localizes at the apical membrane domain of the superficial epithelial cells of both small and large intestine  similarly to that observed in the parotid glands. the apical membrane localization of aqp <dig> has been also confirmed by immunoblotting results obtained with bbmv preparations . thus a role of this water/anion channel in the intestinal absorptive and secretive functions cannot be excluded. this suggestion has been strengthened by the observed increase in aqp <dig> transcript and protein in fed rat . interestingly, of all aqps studied, aqp <dig> was the only one upregulated by feeding in the small intestinal mucosa. higher aqp <dig> mrna levels were conversely found in fasting condition. however, further experiments are required to clarify fully the meaning of this finding. moreover, no modification by feeding was observed in renal mrna extracts .

the involvement of a transcellular pathway for water movement across the intestinal epithelium has acquired an ever-growing importance in the last years since several aqps have been identified in the digestive system of mammals, i.e. aqp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . these aqps have been found in different cells of the intestinal epithelium  and in different cellular membranes . however, the direct aqps involvement in water transport through apical membranes of the intestinal superficial epithelial cells has been demonstrated only for aqp <dig> in rat isolated colonocytes  <cit>  and for aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> in rat small intestinal bbmv  <cit> .

recently, aqp <dig>  a new member of the aquaglyceroporin family, was identified in the human small and large intestine  <cit> , and, due to its localization on the apical membrane of the absorptive cells, an important role for it in water intestinal absorption was suggested  <cit> . this hypothesis was successively disproved, since further studies identified two aqp <dig> isoforms localized in the small intestinal capillary endothelium and in the gastroenteropancrestic endocrine cells  <cit> . we tested therefore its presence in the rat intestine by rt-pcr but no signal was observed .

we previously proposed a model for transcellular aqp-mediated water movement in the absorptive intestinal cells  <cit> . in the working model water entered the luminal side through aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> and exited at the basolateral side through aqp <dig>  and aqp <dig>   <cit> . we have now to modify this model by including the data reported here, i.e. the presence of an apical aqp <dig>  however, the unique functional properties of aqp <dig> do not necessarily suggest its involvement in the apical water transport through the superficial epithelial cells of the small and large intestine.

even if aqp <dig> belongs to the aquaporin water channel family, at neutral ph it functions as anion-selective channel  <cit>  and only at ph lower than  <dig>  it becomes a functional water channel with maintained ion channel properties. this is interesting in the light of the well know fact that the rat duodenal and jejunal surface have an acidic microclimate  that can modulate the intestinal transport of several substances, including weak electrolytes and vitamins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results strengthen the role of aqp <dig> in the homeostatic osmoregulation of the cytoplasm and its organelles, but also, for the first time, suggest a role upregulated by feeding for aqp <dig> in ion and water absorption in the gastrointestinal tract epithelium.
