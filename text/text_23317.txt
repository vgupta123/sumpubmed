BACKGROUND
clostridium perfringens is an important gram-positive pathogen, but also a member of the normal gastrointestinal flora of humans and animals  <cit> . the pathogenicity of this bacterium to humans and livestock largely depends upon toxin production, with  <dig> different c. perfringens toxins reported in the literature  <cit> . most c. perfringens toxin genes, including three typing toxin  genes and recently identified novel toxin genes, such as necrotic enteritis b-like toxin gene  and toxin c. perfringens large cytotoxin gene , are present on plasmids  <cit> . therefore, the presence of toxin gene-encoding plasmids is crucial for c. perfringens virulence.

for c. perfringens strains producing c. perfringens enterotoxin  to cause non-foodborne human intestinal disease, they not only have to produce toxins, but also must overcome the normal microbial population so they can grow to pathogenic levels  <cit> . for this purpose, the production of bacteriocins might be useful  <cit> . previous surveys of bacteriocins support this possibility since studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s showed that many c. perfringens isolates produce bacteriocins  <cit> . however, a bacteriocin of c. perfringens has received much less attention recently than the toxins which induce the diseases caused by this bacterium, such as human and veterinary diarrhea.

on a completely sequenced cpe-encoding plasmid, pcpf <dig>  in the enterotoxigenic f <dig> strain, which was isolated from a patient suffering from non-foodborne diarrheal disease, the gene encoding a bacteriocin that contributes to c. perfringens virulence was not identified. therefore, an unidentified virulence factor such as a bacteriocin could be encoded on another co-existing plasmid.

in this study, the plasmid carrying a bacteriocin gene  homolog in the enterotoxigenic f <dig> strain was completely sequenced. thereafter, to understand the relationships with the co-existing prototype of toxin-encoding plasmid or other type of toxin plasmid such as pcp <dig>  the replication region of bcn-encoding plasmid was identified. then, the replication region on pbcnf <dig> was compared with those of other sequenced plasmids by comparative genomics because the replication region, which must contain the replication initiation protein  gene , is a basic element of a plasmid  <cit> . moreover, the identified replication and putative partitioning region was functionally investigated.

methods
bacterial strains and media
clostridium perfringens strains f <dig>  nctc <dig>  atcc <dig>  and strain  <dig> were used in this study  <cit> . for the growth of these strains, tgy medium  with or without chloramphenicol   was used as previously described  <cit> . e. coli hb <dig> was used as the host for the recombinant plasmids used for dna sequencing or for constructing recombinant plasmids carrying the putative replication region from c. perfringens plasmids. for the selection of e. coli or c. perfringens transformants, tsb agar containing ampicillin   or chloramphenicol  and brain heart infusion   agar with chloramphenicol  were used, respectively.

complete sequencing of the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid pbcnf <dig> in f <dig> and plasmid pcp8533s <dig> carrying a pip404-rep homolog in nctc8533
sequencing of a bacteriocin-encoding plasmid in strain f <dig> was performed using a previously described method  <cit> . briefly, crude plasmid dna preparations were prepared as described previously  <cit>  and then transformants carrying f <dig> plasmid dna fragments, which were not from the completely sequenced cpe-encoding plasmid pcpf <dig>  were selected and then sequenced. to complete the sequencing of pbcnf <dig>  long-range pcr analysis was performed using primers based upon end-sequence information. those pcr products were then sequenced using a primer walking strategy.

for sequencing of a small plasmid named pcp8533s <dig>  which is present in type b strain nctc <dig> and carries a pip <dig> rep homolog, pcr primers were constructed based on the sequence of a small plasmid in atcc <dig>  another type b strain . the pcr products obtained using those primers were then used for direct sequencing.

putative orfs on both sequenced plasmids were predicted with orf finder software  and a putative shine-dalgarno sequence for each orf was identified. annotation of each orf was predicted with blast blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.egi web database software.

identification of the replication region in the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid pbcnf5603
sequence analysis with blast indicated that pbcnf <dig> mainly consists of two regions: a pcp13-like orf region and a pip404-like bacteriocin region . in addition, each region of pbcnf <dig> was shown to harbor putative replication regions, namely, the pbcn16- <dig> region homologous to the pcp63-para -parb  gene cluster on pcp <dig> and the pbcn29- <dig> region homologous to the cop-rep region of pip <dig>  to investigate the replication ability of these two putative replication regions, each one was separately amplified by pcr. the primers used for amplification of the putative replication regions are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in these pcr reactions, each pcr mixture contained  <dig> μl of template dna,  <dig>  μl of gxl taq polymerase ,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm ntps,  <dig> μl of pcr buffer, and  <dig> μl of each primer pair . pcr reactions were performed under conditions previously described  <cit> . after confirming pcr amplification, each pcr product was clarified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit  and then digested with restriction enzymes: avrii/bstbi  or avrii/hpai  for the pcp13-homologous putative replication region on pbcnf5603; spei/snabi  for the pip404-homologous putative replication region on pbcnf5603; and bsmi/pflmi  for the putative rep region on pcp8533s <dig> . digested dna fragments were subjected to filling with klenow fragment polymerase , and were ligated into a fragment of shuttle vector pjir <dig>  in which the rep gene of pip <dig> had been removed by digestion with xmni  and spei   <cit> .

the resultant plasmids, named pkz <dig>  pkz <dig>  pkz <dig>  or pkz <dig>  were transformed into e. coli hb <dig> and then electroporated into transformable c. perfringens type a strains, atcc <dig> and strain  <dig>  using electro cell manipulator, ecm <dig> , according to the manufacturer’s instructions   <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  ml of overnight tgy culture of c. perfringens strain was inoculated into  <dig> ml of tgy medium and anaerobically incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> to  <dig> h. bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  x g for  <dig> min. collected cells were washed twice with smp solution  and then centrifuged. the washed bacterial pellet was re-suspended with  <dig>  ml of smp solution. a  <dig> μl aliquot of re-suspended cells was used for electroporation. transformants carrying a recombinant plasmid were selected on bhi agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol.table  <dig> plasmids constructed and used in this study



compatibility assay between recombinant plasmids derived from pbcnf <dig> and pcp13
from the results of comparative genomics, the identified rep gene was highly similar to pcp <dig>  in strain  <dig>  to understand the relationship between pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig>  compatibility assay was performed. the constructed recombinant plasmid  carrying the rep gene of pbcnf <dig> was introduced into strain  <dig> according to the electroporation methods previously described  <cit> . in the final step of the electroporation procedures, electroporated samples were inoculated into  <dig> ml of pre-warmed tgy medium without antibiotics. after 3-h incubation at  <dig> °c,  <dig>  ml of a  <dig> ml transformed culture sample was inoculated into  <dig> ml of tgy medium with chloramphenicol  and incubated at  <dig> °c. the next day,  <dig>  ml of culture sample was inoculated in fresh tgy medium with chloramphenicol and incubated at  <dig> °c . one-day culture of this second-passage sample was spread onto a bhi agar plate containing  <dig> mg/ml chloramphenicol, which was then anaerobically incubated at  <dig> °c.

to investigate the presence or absence of pcp <dig> in transformed c. perfringens colonies, randomly selected chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were tested by colony pcr assay for three genes: cpb <dig> , topa , and cna , on pcp <dig>  for colony pcr reaction, colonies were suspended in  <dig> μl of distilled water and then heated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min. after brief centrifugation,  <dig> μl of supernatant was used as a dna template with pcr reaction. each pcr mixture  contained  <dig> μl of template dna,  <dig>  μl of ex taq polymerase ,  <dig> μl of  <dig>  mm ntps,  <dig> μl of pcr buffer, and  <dig> μl of each primer pair . pcr reactions were performed under the following conditions:  <dig> °c, for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of  <dig> °c for  <dig> sec,  <dig> °c  or  <dig> °c  for  <dig> sec, and  <dig> °c for  <dig> sec; and a single extension at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min. pcr products were electrophoresed on a  <dig>  % agarose gel followed by staining with ultrapower™ dna stain , and then fluorescence was detected using las- <dig> .

the stability of the constructed recombinant plasmid in two type a c. perfringens strains
upstream of the rep gene, pbcnf <dig> is also assumed to harbor the conserved plasmid partitioning region, including para and parb genes and putative pars sequences. to investigate the contribution of putative plasmid partitioning regions to plasmid stability, the stability of a recombinant plasmid, pkz <dig>  which carries the replication and putative partitioning region, was estimated . first, the recombinant plasmid was introduced into two transformable c. perfringens strains: atcc <dig> and strain  <dig>  the type a atcc <dig> strain is likely to carry no plasmid, but strain  <dig> harbors pcp <dig>  which carries a replication and partitioning region homologous to that of pbcnf <dig>  as described in the results section. therefore, to estimate the stability of pkz <dig> in strain  <dig>  two chloramphenicol-resistant pcp13-free clones of strain 13-derived transformants were selected using the compatibility assay described above, and then used for plasmid stability assay; specifically, two clones of atcc3624-derived transformants and two clones of pcp13-free strain  <dig> transformants were used.

each of the stocked clones in cooked meat medium was inoculated into  <dig> ml of ftg medium  and incubated at  <dig> °c. overnight cultures were then inoculated into  <dig> ml of tgy medium, incubated at  <dig> °c, then spread onto a bhi agar plate with chloramphenicol , and then anaerobically incubated at  <dig> °c. to estimate the stability of the recombinant plasmid, pkz <dig>  in c. perfringens strains, two separate colonies of each clone were inoculated into  <dig> ml of tgy medium cotaining chloramphenicol  and incubated at  <dig> °c. then,  <dig>  ml of overnight culture was inoculated into  <dig> ml of fresh tgy medium containing chloramphenicol. after incubation for  <dig> h at  <dig> °c, a  <dig> μl culture sample was transferred to  <dig> ml of fresh tgy without chloramphenicol, so that approximately  <dig> generations were obtained per growth cycle of  <dig> h   <cit> . these inoculated cultures were used as a first passage. every  <dig> h,  <dig> μl of the full-grown cultures was transferred to  <dig> ml of fresh tgy. after  <dig> passages, the cultures were diluted and plated on a bhi plate without chloramphenicol. determination of the fraction of recombinant plasmid cured cells in the population was performed by replica-picking of  <dig> randomly chosen colonies onto bhi with chloramphenicol  and without chloramphenicol, and scoring the chloramphenicol-sensitive colonies. to confirm the presence or absence of pkz <dig>  eight chloramphenicol-sensitive and eight chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were tested by colony pcr assay for the rep gene. incompatibility between pkz <dig> and indigenous pcp <dig> must influence the stability of the recombinant plasmid. to avoid the possibility of contamination with original strain  <dig>  the same sixteen colonies were tested by cpb2-pcr assay.

RESULTS
organization of the bcn5603-encoding plasmid pbcnf <dig> in f5603
in a previous study with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  analysis, c. perfringens f <dig> strain carried two large plasmids, ~ <dig> kb cpe-encoding plasmid and another ~ <dig> kb plasmid  <cit>  . sequencing revealed that pbcnf <dig>  is  <dig>  bp in size, with  <dig>  % gc content and encoding  <dig> orfs. the size of sequenced plasmid closely agreed with the predicted size of a smaller ~ <dig> kb plasmid in f <dig> strain in pfge analysis. in comparison with the sequences of pcp <dig> and pip <dig>  pbcnf <dig> carries  <dig> or  <dig> orfs that are highly homologous to orfs present on pcp <dig> and pip <dig>  respectively  <cit>   . of the fourteen pcp <dig> orf homologs on pbcnf <dig>  a gene cluster from pbcn <dig> to pbcn <dig> was similarly arranged from pcp <dig> to pcp <dig>  and a gene cluster from pbcn <dig> to pbcn <dig> was also from pcp <dig> to pcp <dig>    <cit> . in the gene cluster from pbcn <dig> to pbcn <dig>  pbcnf <dig> carries para and parb genes, which are highly homologous to the respective genes on pcp <dig>  but which are absent from pip <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this region might contain the genes for plasmid replication and maintenance, while the replication system of pcp <dig> has not yet been identified  <cit> .fig.  <dig> genetic organization of predicted orfs on pbcnf <dig>  above the line, the orientation of putative orfs is left to right, while under the line, it is the opposite. green boxes depict the orfs homologous to that on pcp <dig>  and red boxes depict those homologous to that on pip <dig>  sequences of pcp <dig> and pip <dig> have been reported previously  <cit> 



in eight shared orfs with pip <dig>  pbcnf <dig> encodes the putative bacteriocin bcn <dig> gene  and upstream uv-inducible regulation genes, uvia and uvib, which are also present on pip <dig>  <cit> . the bcn <dig> gene  was originally found in the type a human isolate cpn <dig>  in comparative genomics, the product of the bcn <dig> gene, bcn <dig>  showed similarity to the gene products in c. perfringens strains: food poisoning strain-derived sm <dig>  type e jgs <dig>  type c jgs <dig>  and type d jgs <dig> strains, in addition to cpn <dig> strain. these bacteriocins in the virulent c. perfringens strain shared conserved domains: two sh3b domains  and peptidase m <dig> superfamily domain, which contained two zn-binding sites. in addition to these conserved domains on putative bacteriocins, bcn <dig> carried putative cell wall binding repeat, and two glucan-binding repeats .

of the bacteriocins in c. perfringens, the regulation of bcn <dig> production has been investigated most intensively; bcn <dig> is induced by an sos response to uv light or mitomycin c treatment  <cit> . of the putative bacteriocin regulatory genes, the putative uvia gene on pbcnf <dig> has  <dig>  % nucleotide sequence homology with the uvia gene, which is the putative sigma factor for the bcn <dig> gene on pip <dig>  in addition, on the basis of amino acid substitution of the uvia genes on both plasmids, regions  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the uvia sigma factor, which are implicated in interactions with the − <dig> and − <dig> sequence of the promoter, were completely identical  <cit> . the uvib gene on pbcnf <dig> had a completely identical nucleotide sequence with the uvib gene, which is the putative bacteriocin immunity-related gene on pip <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the bcn5603-uvia-uvib gene cluster had three promoter sequences almost identical to those in the original bcn gene region on pip <dig>  specifically, compared with the matching promoter sequences of bcn <dig>  <cit> , the bcn <dig> gene has two putative promoter sequences: p <dig>  and p <dig>  which are completely identical, as well as p <dig> with only one nucleotide change. therefore, the bcn <dig> gene might be dependent on uvia for activation. furthermore, the p <dig> and p <dig> promoters upstream of the uvia gene on pbcnf <dig> had identical sequences to those on pip <dig>  and the putative repressor lexa-binding site of the bcn <dig> gene also had an identical sequence with the corresponding site in the pip <dig> bcn <dig> regulatory region  <cit> . from these highly similar sequences in the regulatory region, the enterotoxigenic strain f <dig> might produce bcn <dig> in a similar manner to bcn <dig> by strain cnp <dig> 

pbcnf <dig> also carries a cluster of five orfs  with high homology to respective genes present on the chromosome of e. faecalis v <dig> and the s. agalactiae 2603v/r strain  <cit>   .

overall, pbcnf <dig> was identified as a bacteriocin-encoding plasmid that developed from a mosaic fusion of c. perfringens plasmids, cpb2-encoding pcp <dig> and bcn-encoding pip <dig>  and a foreign gene cluster.

identification of the replication region of pbcnf5603
completely sequenced pbcnf <dig> is likely to be an important plasmid for c. perfringens virulence because this plasmid encodes a bacteriocin gene. moreover, pbcnf <dig> co-exists with one of the prototype cpe-encoding plasmids, pcpf <dig>  therefore, to investigate further the bacteriocin gene-encoding plasmid, the replication region of pbcnf <dig> was initially identified in the current study. sequencing and comparative genomics showed that pbcnf <dig> carried two sets of potential plasmid replication regions, namely, the region containing putative plasmid partitioning genes, para and parb, which was similar to that region on pcp <dig> , and putative rep and cop genes similar to the replication region of pip <dig> 

it was initially shown that a recombinant plasmid named pkz <dig> carrying a ~ <dig>  kb fragment including the pbcn <dig> -para-parb-pbcn <dig>  gene cluster could replicate in c. perfringens strains, atcc <dig> and strain  <dig> . the recombinant plasmid that still supported plasmid replication in two strains was pkz <dig>  carrying a smaller ~ <dig>  kb region containing pbcn <dig>  and its upstream region  . these results indicate that pbcn <dig>  the product of which is a homolog of the pcp <dig> product, was likely to be the rep gene of pbcnf <dig>  the upstream region of the identified rep gene, five distinct pairs of  <dig> to  <dig> bp inverted repeats , which could act as iteron-like sequences in the initiation of pbcnf <dig> replication, and an at-rich region, which is also important for plasmid replication, were identified   <cit> . therefore, pbcnf <dig> was identified as one of the iteron-containing plasmids  in c. perfringens.fig.  <dig>

concerning the replication ability of the second region, atcc <dig> strain carrying the constructed plasmid named pkz <dig>  which carried the putative cop-rep region similar to the replication region of pip <dig>  was not detected in several electroporation experiments . on the other hand, a constructed plasmid named pkz <dig> carrying the ~ <dig>  kb region containing the putative rep gene of pcp8533s <dig> could replicate in the atcc <dig> strain .

collectively, only the region containing genes similar to the genes on pcp <dig> was identified as a region carrying the newly identified rep gene, while two potential replication  regions were identified on pbcnf <dig> by comparative genomics.

comparative genomic analysis of the genes in the identified replication region
by comparative genomics using the genbank database, plasmids carrying a homolog of the identified rep gene of pbcnf <dig> were investigated. in addition to pcp <dig> on pcp <dig> , four other homologous genes were found, namely, a gene on pcp-os <dig> , a gene on pcp-ts <dig>  , a gene on pf262b , and a gene on a plasmid in the wal- <dig> strain   <cit>  . these genes encode hypothetical proteins. of these genes, pcp <dig>  on pcp <dig> was the smallest; the rep gene on pbcnf <dig> was  <dig> bp long, and the homologous genes on pcp-ts <dig> or pcp-os <dig> and those of pf262b or plasmid in wal- <dig> were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. in the upstream region, each of the putative rep genes on the four plasmids carried iteron-like sequences that were highly similar to those of the rep gene of pbcnf <dig>  while the putative iteron sequences were not identified in the upstream region of pcp <dig> . moreover, pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig> in strain  <dig> from our laboratory stocks were likely to be incompatible . therefore, for further comparison of those homologs, sequencing analysis of the putative replication region of pcp <dig> in strain  <dig> in our laboratory stocks was performed. in terms of the sequencing results of the pcp <dig> region in strain  <dig> from our laboratory stocks, pcp <dig> was  <dig> bp long and also harbored highly similar iteron-like sequences with a putative rep gene on other plasmids  .table  <dig> similarity of the genes on the replication and partitioning region among c. perfringens plasmids carrying pcp <dig> homolog

collectively, bacteriocin- or toxin-encoding plasmids harbor the rep gene homologous to that of pbcnf5603; the plasmid group carrying the pbcnf5603-type rep gene is likely to contribute to c. perfringens virulence.

sequencing also showed that pbcnf <dig> carries several gene homologs that appear to be involved in the replication and maintenance systems of pip <dig>  <cit> . the replication system of pip <dig> is similar to the inc <dig> family of plasmids, whose replication system consists of cop-rep-ori-res genes  <cit> . of these four replication component genes, pbcnf <dig> was found to carry two orfs, namely, pbcn <dig> and pbcn <dig>  which are highly similar to pip <dig> genes that are thought to encode putative plasmid stability and replication factors, respectively  <cit> . therefore, a candidate rep protein of pbcnf <dig> is probably encoded by pbcn <dig>  which is homologous  to the rep gene  of pip <dig> . however, pbcn <dig>  which is ~ <dig>  bp in size, is smaller than pip <dig> orf <dig>  by approximately  <dig> bp in the 3’ region .

a putative rep gene, which is also similar to the rep gene on pip <dig>  was also found on a small plasmid  in type b strain nctc <dig> and named pcp8533s <dig>  . the size of this rep gene was similar to that of the rep gene on pip <dig>  but larger than that of the pbcn <dig> gene on pbcn <dig>  in the genbank database, homologous rep genes were found on a ~ <dig> kb plasmid in type b strain atcc <dig> , on a ~ <dig> kb plasmid in type c strain jgs <dig> , on a ~ <dig> kb plasmid in type d strain jgs <dig> , and on a ~ <dig> kb bacteriocin-encoding plasmid in type a enterotoxigenic sm <dig> strains . the length of these putative rep genes was ~ <dig>  bp, while that of a pip404-rep homologous gene  on pbcnf <dig> was smaller than other putative rep genes by ~ <dig>  bp, with truncation at the 3’ end because of an insertion  producing a stop codon at a later site. interestingly, a ~ <dig>  bp sequence at the 5’ end of these putative rep genes was very similar , while ~ <dig> bp sequences on the 3’ ends of these genes were less conserved .

compatibility between pcp <dig> and constructed recombinant plasmids carrying the identified replication region
each set of twenty-five chloramphenicol-resistant colonies from second-passaged cultures of strain  <dig>  which were introduced by recombinant plasmids, pkz <dig>  or pkz <dig> , were investigated . no chloramphenicol-resistant colonies showed a positive reaction in the pcr assay for the cpb <dig> gene, and these investigated colonies also showed a negative reaction in the pcr assay for the topa gene or the cna gene on pcp13; this was likely to have occurred to cure the cpb2-encoding plasmid, pcp <dig>  in strain 13-derived colonies introduced by one of the recombinant plasmids that carry the identified replication region with or without a putative partitioning region.

stability of the recombinant plasmid carrying the identified replication region and a putative partitioning region
the putative partitioning region of pbcnf <dig> contains two genes, para  and parb , and a putative pars sequence . the para and parb genes were found on five other plasmids that harbor the identified rep gene homolog, and those gene products had more than  <dig> % identity in terms of substituted amino acids . a putative pars sequence contained ir <dig>  ir <dig>  and one repeated sequence , and the sequences of the pars region were almost identical among six plasmids; that is, these plasmids are likely to carry a similar plasmid replication and partitioning region to that of pbcnf <dig>  these findings also indicate that a putative partitioning system on these plasmids might be the parabs system.

to investigate the contribution of the putative partitioning system on pbcnf <dig> to plasmid stability, the fraction carrying the recombinant plasmid, pkz <dig>  was monitored without any selection in two different c. perfringens hosts. in transformants derived from c. perfringens strains, atcc <dig> and strain  <dig>  the proportion of chloramphenicol-resistant colonies dropped to ~ <dig> % after  <dig> generations without antibiotic selection, while it was more than  <dig> % under antibiotic pressure . therefore, the recombinant plasmid was considered to be unstable in both strains; all transformants from both strains showed high plasmid loss in terms of the proportion of plasmid-free cells. moreover, there was no clear relationship between the host strain type and the stability of the recombinant plasmid, while strain  <dig> originally harbored an indigenous pcp <dig> that carries the closely related replication and partioning region of pbcnf <dig> table  <dig> stability of a recombinant plasmid, pkz <dig>  and plasmids, pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig>  in c. perfringens strains

*: rate of randomly selected colonies


#: to investigate the presence of pbcnf <dig> in f <dig> strain or pcp <dig> in strain <dig>  randomly selected colonies were tested with colony pcr assay for three genes, rep , bcn <dig>  and cpb <dig> genes. colony pcr reactions were performed under the same conditions as described in the plasmid compatibility section



in contrast to the stability of the recombinant plasmid in c. perfringens strains, an indigenous plasmid in the original strain, pbcnf <dig> in f <dig> or pcp <dig> in strain  <dig>  was extremely stable; after  <dig> generations, no indigenous plasmid-cured colonies were detected by pcr assays for two genes: the rep and the bcn <dig> or cpb <dig> genes, respectively .

discussion
bacteriocins could contribute to diseases caused by c. perfringens, for example, promoting intestinal colonization  <cit> . of several identified c. perfringens bacteriocins, the most investigated one is bcn <dig> in the type a cpe-negative strain cpn <dig>  bcn <dig> production is induced by stress, such as uv irradiation, and its gene is encoded by the well-studied plasmid pip <dig>  which has been completely sequenced and for which the gene for plasmid replication was identified  <cit> . from the results in the current study, a plasmid named pbcnf <dig>  which does not encode toxins, was found to co-exist with the cpe/cpb <dig> toxin gene encoding plasmid pcpf <dig> in the enterotoxigenic type a strain f <dig>  pbcnf <dig> carries the putative bacteriocin gene bcn <dig> and its regulatory sequences, as determined from the results of complete sequence analysis  . of all c. perfringens bacteriocin genes, only the genetic background of the bacteriocin  gene  found on pip <dig> in the type a cpn <dig> strain has been carefully investigated  <cit> . the same as the bcn gene on pip <dig>  the bcn <dig> gene had regulatory uvia and uvib genes and regulatory sequences, such as promoter sequences and the lexa-binding sequence. moreover, these regulatory sequences were almost identical to the respective sequences on pip <dig>  in fact, c. perfringens f <dig> strain was likely to produce a bacteriocin, which was promoted by uv irradiation, using pcp13-cured strain  <dig> as an indicator strain. moreover, transcription of the bcn <dig> gene was likely to be promoted by the addition of mitomycin c ; that is, the extreme conservation of the bcn gene cluster on pbcnf <dig> indicates that production of the bcn <dig> bacteriocin might be induced in the same manner as for bcn <dig> in the cpn <dig> strain.

comparative genomics using the genbank database indicated that bcn <dig> gene homologs have been found in several other virulent strains. these homologs encode putative bacteriocins that carry commonly conserved domains, namely, sh <dig> and peptidase m <dig> family domains. moreover, a recent pcr survey indicated that bcn <dig> gene homologs are found in cpe-positive type a human disease isolates , as well as type b, d, and e animal disease isolates  <cit> . taking these findings together, the production of this group of bacteriocins by c. perfringens virulent strains might benefit for them compared with other enteric bacteria in the human or animal gut, so this group of bacteriocins might contribute to the virulence of c. perfringens strains.

to date, only two kinds of rep gene have been identified on c. perfringens plasmids: the rep gene on the antibiotic resistance pcw <dig> plasmid and the rep gene on the bacteriocin gene-encoding pip <dig>  <cit> . the rep gene of the most representative toxin gene-encoding plasmids is highly similar to the rep gene of pcw <dig>  <cit> . to understand the relationship between pbcnf <dig> and other plasmids, especially plasmids carrying the previously identified rep genes, the replication region of pbcnf <dig> was identified. on the basis of sequence information for pbcnf <dig>  a candidate of the putative replication region, which is similar to the putative pcp <dig> plasmid replication region, was identified, while the rep gene of pcp <dig> has not yet been identified. the results of investigating the replication ability of the pbcn <dig> region indicated that recombinant plasmids , both of which carry pbcn <dig> and its upstream region, were replicable in two transformable c. perfringens strains, atcc <dig> and strain 13; the similarly organized region of pbcnf <dig> with that of pcp <dig> is most likely to be the replication region that must contain the rep gene. moreover, five inverted repeated sequences, probably iterons, and an at-rich region were also identified upstream of the pbcn <dig> orf; pbcn <dig> is likely to be the rep gene of pbcnf <dig>  and therefore pbcnf <dig> might be an iteron-containing plasmid . by comparative genomics using the genbank database, pbcn <dig> homologs were found in several other plasmids including pcp <dig>  pcp-os <dig>  and pcp-ts <dig>  which are toxin-encoding plasmids other than the prototypes of toxin-encoding plasmid  <cit> . moreover, these plasmids carry upstream iteron-like sequences that are highly similar to those sequences of pbcn <dig> . therefore, the plasmid family that carries the pbcn <dig> homolog in the putative replication region is also likely to be icp.

prototypes of toxin-encoding plasmids carry the common replication and partitioning system, the parmrc system, and these systems might be related to plasmid compatibility  <cit> . in the same c. perfringens cells of the f <dig> strain, the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid pbcnf <dig>  which carries a different replication and partitioning system, the parabs system, can co-exist with one of the prototypes of toxin-encoding plasmids, cpe-encoding plasmid pcpf <dig>  on the other hand, recombinant plasmids carrying the identified rep gene and upstream iteron sequences of pbcnf <dig> were likely to induce pcp <dig> curing in strain 13; pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig> might be incompatible plasmids, possibly because of iteron-based incompatibility. in general, two components, rep and iterons, lie at the center of all models of icp replication control, so replication-mediated incompatibility has been used to classify plasmids  <cit> . taking these findings together, pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig> are likely to be classified into the same inc group, but different groups from the prototypes of toxin-encoding plasmid. moreover, on the basis of the high similarity of upstream iteron sequences of the putative rep gene, recently sequenced plasmids, pcp-ts <dig>  pcp-os <dig>  and other plasmids , are likely to belong to the pbcnf <dig> inc family  <cit> .

a recombinant plasmid named pkz <dig>  which carries pip <dig> rep homolog, pbcn <dig>  is non-functional in c. perfringens strain, while pbcn <dig> was also identified as a candidate of the rep gene on pbcnf <dig> by a blast search . on the other hand, pip <dig> rep gene homolog on a small plasmid, pcp8533s <dig>  in type b strain nctc <dig> is functional based on the transformation experiment results obtained using another recombinant plasmid, pkz <dig>  by comparative genomics using the genbank database, pip <dig> rep gene homologs were also found in several strains that also harbor prototypes of toxin-encoding plasmid. comparing the sequence of these rep homologs in different strains, pbcn <dig> on pbcnf <dig> was ~ <dig> bp smaller than other homologs; in addition, pbcn <dig> on pbcnf <dig> has a point mutation and, as a result, may have become non-functional . from these findings, it was suggested that ~ <dig> bp on the 3’ side of this type of rep gene might be important for plasmid replication.

upstream of the pbcn <dig> rep gene, the putative plasmid partitioning-related genes  and a putative pars sequence were identified . a similarly organized putative partitioning region was also found on pcp <dig>  pcp-os <dig>  pcp-ts <dig>  pf <dig>  and plasmid in the wal- <dig> strain. therefore, the highly homologous rep gene  and a putative partitioning region are likely to be a core region of these plasmids. in general, the partitioning region has a central role in plasmid segregation and is thus important for plasmid stability  <cit> . to investigate the contribution of the putative partitioning region of pbcnf <dig> to plasmid stability, the stability of the recombinant plasmid that carries the replication and partitioning region was evaluated in two electro-transformable strains, atcc <dig> and strain  <dig>  strain  <dig> originally carries the indigenous plasmid, pcp <dig>  which has a replication and partitioning region that is closely related to that of pbcnf <dig>  while the atcc <dig> strain naturally harbors no plasmid. although strain  <dig> and f <dig> strain stably carried pcp <dig> or pbcnf <dig>  respectively, the recombinant plasmid that carries the pbcnf5603-derived replication and partitioning region was relatively unstable, even in pcp13-free strain 13-derived strain, as in the atcc <dig> strain. these findings might indicate that the identified replication and partitioning region of pbcnf <dig> is insufficient for plasmid stability, while the replication and partitioning region is important for plasmid stability  <cit> . the possible reasons for recombinant plasmid instability are as follows: 1) the influence of the integrity of iteron sequences and arrangement; 2) the sequence of the genes in this region might be strictly controlled: the integrity of these regions might be important for plasmid stability; and 3) the gene encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical protein on pbcnf <dig> could have an important role in the stability of the plasmid. in addition to these possibilities, host factors could possibly promote plasmid stability; the replication and partitioning region might co-operate with host chromosomal factors  <cit> . strain  <dig> is likely to have a chromosomal genetic background that is more similar to the f <dig> strain than to the atcc <dig> strain, given previous mlst results  <cit> . however, the stability levels of the recombinant plasmid that carries the replication and partitioning region were very similar in those two c. perfringens strains. therefore, the contribution of the host factors to the stability of the recombinant plasmid could differ compared with plasmids in e. coli.

interestingly, a similarly organized putative plasmid partitioning region, the parabs region, was found on a β toxin gene -encoding plasmid, pcp8533cbp, in the type b nctc <dig> strain  . by comparative genomics using the genbank database, these conserved parabs regions were also identified on the cpb plasmids in the type b atcc <dig> strain  and in the type c jgs <dig> strain . however, these cpb-encoding plasmids did not harbor a pcp <dig> homolog on the upstream region of the para gene. the parabs region on these cpb-encoding plasmids could be related to plasmid properties, such as partitioning element-based plasmid incompatibility.

to our knowledge, this is the first report about identification of the rep gene of a bacteriocin-encoding plasmid in enterotoxigenic c. perfringens strain. the rep gene identified in the current study is unique and might be encoded by important plasmids because the identified rep gene homologs were found on not only the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid, but also toxin-encoding plasmids. in addition, c. perfringens plasmids that carry the identified rep gene or its homolog might be the same inc family plasmids.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study demonstrated that i) the replication region of bacteriocin gene encoding plasmid, pbcnf <dig> in enterotoxigenic c. perfringens strain was identified, ii) the plasmid carrying the identified rep gene are predicted as a iteron-containing plasmid , iii) the identified replication region are also found on toxin gene encoding plasmid in virulent strains, e.g. bec  gene encoding plasmids, iv) the identified replication region contributes plasmid compatibility; plasmids carrying the homologs with the identified rep gene should belong to the same inc family, v) the plasmid replication and the predicted plasmid partitioning regions are insufficient for stable maintenance of recombinant plasmid which carry those of pbcnf <dig> in c. perfringens strains.

collectively, findings in the current study provide the important insights of the bacteriocin gene and toxin gene encoding plasmids in virulent c. perfringens strains; contribution of the replication region to plasmid compatibility have not been investigated in previous studies, while the replication region of a few plasmids in virulent c. perfringens strains was reported. moreover, role of the plasmid replication and partitioning regions on c. perfringens plasmid stability have not been investigated, although the important plasmids are likely to be highly stable in virulent strains. further detailed studies on the issues investigated in the current study should help in understanding plasmid biology in virulent c. perfringens strains.
