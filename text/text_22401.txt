BACKGROUND
pectins, a class of polysaccharide polymer typically characterized by a linear backbone of α- <dig> -linked galacturonic acid  residues, are a major component of primary plant cell walls, and within the wall form a matrix in which a network of cellulose and hemicellulose is embedded  <cit> . pectins contribute to the mechanical strength and physical properties of primary cell walls, but also function in intercellular adhesion  <cit> , and can act as signaling molecules in morphogenesis and pathogen defense  <cit> .

plant growth and development is accompanied by dynamic remodeling of the cell wall, which in turn requires modifications of the various cell wall components including pectin. in accordance with the often complex structure of some pectins, an assortment of pectinase activities modify or degrade these polymers. pectinesterases target methyl-esterified homogalacturonan, yielding substrates for polygalacturonases and pectate lyases, which cleave the gala backbone  <cit> . rhamnogalacturonases and rhamnogalacturonan lyases depolymerize branched regions of rhamnogalacturonan, whereas β-galactosidases and α-arabinosidases can degrade the galactan/arabinan/arabinogalactan side chains. pectate lyases  have been most extensively studied in erwinia chrysanthemi, a major causal agent of soft-rot diseases that affect a wide range of plant species  <cit> . their action not only results in maceration of plant tissues but also can activate plant defense systems  <cit> . plant pectate lyase-like  genes encode proteins with strong amino acid sequence homology with the pelc isoform of bacterial pectate lyases  <cit>  and exist as large families in plants where studied  <cit> . the abundance of pll genes in plants, including  <dig> in arabidopsis,  <dig> in rice, and  <dig> in poplar, has arisen from multiple gene duplication events  <cit> , a process that may enhance plasticity in adaptation to changing environments  <cit> . models predict that gene redundancy is evolutionarily stable only when duplicated genes differentiate in some aspect of their function, suggesting that individual members of large families such as pll may have some unique function  <cit> .

various analyses of pll genes from plants revealed expression in a broad range of organs and plant parts including root, leaf, flower, pollen, filament, style, pistil, and ripening fruit  <cit> . pll genes in several studies also showed elevated expression in response to auxin, wounding, and/or pathogen infection  <cit> . transcriptional analysis in arabidopsis revealed that a small subset of pll genes were up-regulated during stamen abscission or in cortical cell separation during the emergence of the lateral root  <cit> . reduced expression of strawberry pl <dig> in transgenic strawberry plants suggested a natural role in tissue softening during fruit ripening  <cit> . all of these data implicate pll genes in various plant growth and development events. however, the activity of these genes has been characterized only at the level of entire organs or plant parts, potentially obscuring important sub-organ or cell-type-specific activities.

during plant growth and development, there are many events in which adjacent cells separate in a coordinated manner. cell separation resulting in organ abscission, or anther or fruit dehiscence, occurs in predetermined positions, called abscission zones  or dehiscence zones , respectively  <cit> . intercellular space formed in leaves and stems can result from restricted separation of cells at the tricellular regions  <cit> . fruit ripening also involves limited cell separation, in which only the middle lamella is degraded, with tricellular junctions and plasmodesmata often remaining intact  <cit> . targeted cell separation is also involved in the processes of seed germination, lateral root emergence, pollen tube penetration through the transmitting tract, and shedding of columella root cap cells  <cit> . in this study, we examined spatial-temporal expression patterns of promoters of pll family members, focusing on the various cell separation and wall loosening events that occur during arabidopsis growth and development.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
based on peptide sequence homology with the enzymatically characterized pectate lyase pl <dig> from banana and annotated protein domains, the arabidopsis genome encodes for  <dig> pectate-lyase-like proteins. neighbor-joining analysis partitioned these protein sequences into five subfamilies . this genomic content and phylogenetic organization is similar to that previously reported for plls from multiple plant species including arabidopsis  <cit> . all arabidopsis plls exhibited a region of sequence homology with pectate lyase c  from erwinia chrysanthemi, annotated as the pec_lyase_c  domain  and  <dig> of the proteins contain a probable amino-terminal signal peptide. the four members included in subfamily ii  also exhibit a pec_lyase_n  domain, a short region of high homology whose structure or function has not been described. the predicted carboxyl-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol  anchor site previously identified in pmr <dig>  was not obviously present in other plls, suggesting a specialized function of pmr <dig> associated with powdery mildew susceptibility  <cit>  .

estimation of pll gene expression through analysis of public transcriptome data
as a first step to assess expression pattern of pll genes in arabidopsis, we analyzed publicly available transcriptome data. expressed sequence tags  found in public databanks corresponding to individual pll gene family members were found to be sourced from various tissues and stages across arabidopsis growth and development, as well as various environmental conditions . representational frequency of ests for individual pll genes was highly variable both across the gene family and within subfamilies . analysis of publicly available microarray data also suggested that there was at least some unique developmental pattern of expression for most pll genes . a striking exception are the four members of subfamily ii , which showed a similar expression pattern localized predominately to pollen and stamens . several genes  were transcriptionally silenced across most sampled tissues, whereas pll <dig> was apparently expressed ubiquitously, suggesting a very general function . these data are generally consistent with the results of qualitative rt-pcr analysis of pll genes  <cit>  and support a collectively ubiquitous function for plls in growth and development and the potential for functional specialization by many of these genes.

analysis of pll promoter activity
direct approaches for analysis of gene expression such as rna-seq, microarray analysis and rt-pcr can be problematic when applied to large gene families, due to sequence homology among family members and/or inability to resolve expression at the cellular level. accordingly, we utilized a histological reporter gene  to determine the expression regulatory potential of individual pll gene promoters. we engineered the gus coding sequence adjacent to up to ~ <dig> kb of 5' utr/promoter sequence, preserving the authentic start codon of the pll genes, and expressed the pll::gus fusions in transgenic arabidopsis . for each pll gene, we analyzed at least four independent transgenic lines. gus activity patterns were generally consistent between independent lines, with the exception of three  that showed weak and variable activity and were not analyzed further. no gus activity was observed in transgenic plants transformed with a promoterless gus construction, or in non-transgenic plants, in any plant part or under any condition used for analysis. based on the known roles for pectins in cell adhesion and cell wall architecture, we focused our analysis on developmental events closely associated with cell separation.

pll::gus expression associated with cell separation
floral organ azs. cell separation in arabidopsis has been best characterized in the context of floral organ abscission  <cit> . arabidopsis exhibits abscission of sepals, petals, and stamens following pollination. abscission is conditioned by cell separation within the az, a tightly localized region at the base of the floral organs  <cit> . we analyzed developing flowers at various stages until stage  <dig>  when siliques began to yellow  <cit> . . gus activity within the azs was observed for  <dig> pll promoters . for all of these, gus activity was first detected in the azs of sepals, petals, and stamens at stage  <dig>  which followed anthesis by about  <dig> days and was marked by the withering of sepals and petals   <cit> . gus activity had increased within the azs of all three organ types by stage  <dig>  when perianth organs were abscising . for all pll promoters, gus activity in the azs was detectable but very weak at stage  <dig> . activity for pll <dig> in floral organ azs was apparent through stage  <dig>  marked by valve separation . these results are consistent with those of cai and lashbrook  <cit> , who identified pll <dig> as substantially upregulated in the stamen az through transcriptional profiling of laser-capture-microdissected tissues. this upregulation was apparent in the latter part of stage  <dig>  following anthesis by approximately  <dig> h  <cit> .

fruit dz and seed az
the arabidopsis fruit consists of two valves separated by a replum. mature fruits dehisce due to cell separation in the so-called dz, which is distributed along the valve margins and includes a separation layer  <cit> . mature seeds are released from the funiculus, a stalk-like structure connecting seeds to the replum, at a site referred to as the seed az. we analyzed gus activity in these regions during development of flowers and fruit from stage  <dig> through stage  <dig>  marked by seed abscission  <cit>  . we found that  <dig> of the pll promoters drove gus activity within the apparent dz of developing siliques. this subset of plls nearly completely overlapped with the subset driving expression in floral organ azs . for all, gus activity was evident at the onset of stage  <dig>  which preceded separation of the valves by approximately  <dig> h . gus activity was first seen at the basal and apical ends of siliques, where valve separation was initiated, and then became established along the entire length of the fruit as valve separation progressed .

a mostly overlapping subset of  <dig> pll promoters drove gus activity within the apparent seed az . for all of these, gus activity was not observed at the beginning of stage  <dig>  but was obvious in seeds that were still attached to the funiculus and septum before the beginning of stage  <dig> .

radicle emergence during seed germination
during seed germination in arabidopsis, the radicle penetrates a single endosperm cell layer at the micropylar end of the seed  <cit> . to assess pll promoter activity in this region, we stained seeds for gus activity  <dig> h after imbibition, when approximately half of the seeds showed rupture of the testa but before radicle emergence was seen . two pll promoters  directed gus activity in germinating seeds; in both cases gus activity was observed in the micropylar end before obvious emergence of the radicle .

lateral root initiation
arabidopsis lateral roots initiate from the pericycle cell layer and must penetrate the overlaying endodermal, cortical and epidermal layers during emergence  <cit> . although several pll promoters drove gus activity at relatively weak levels along the axis of primary roots , six  showed strong activity in primary roots of 12-d-old plants that were initiating lateral roots. this activity was confined to the endodermal and cortical layers in the region of initiation, but was not obviously restricted to cell layers directly overlaying the new lateral root primordia . we did not observe strong gus staining in the epidermis for any of the six promoters . these findings are consistent with the increased transcriptional accumulation previously reported for pll <dig> and pll <dig> during lateral root emergence induced by auxin  <cit> .

pll::gus expression in other developmental contexts
to analyze pll promoter activity in a broader developmental context, including processes potentially independent of cell separation, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the activity of all of the studied pll promoters during growth and development of arabidopsis.

seedlings
gus activity was detected in 1-d-old seedlings for  <dig> pll promoters. in seedlings, gus staining was seen in the cotyledons, hyocotyl, root/hypocotyl junction, root axes, and/or root tips . a subset of  <dig> of these promoters also drove gus activity along the root axes in 5-d-old seedlings ; this subset included the six that were strongly active during lateral root initiation . four promoters, pll <dig>  pll <dig>  pll <dig>  and pll <dig>  were active in the root tips. pll <dig> was unique in that it drove gus activity specifically in the root tip. both pll <dig> and pll <dig> drove expression in a broad region that included the columella root cap .

hydathodes and stipules
we observed gus activity in fully expanded cotyledons and rosette leaves for seven pll promoters . for all seven, activity was restricted to the tip of the cotyledon/leaf. this corresponds to the position of the hydathodes, specialized pore-like structures that release water and solutes from the xylem  <cit> .

gus activity was apparent within the shoot apex of plants in the vegetative phase for  <dig> pll promoters. upon close examination, in all cases this activity appeared in tightly localized foci bordering the base of initiating leaves, including cauline leaves , at the position of the stipules. in arabidopsis, stipules are apparent on the newly formed leaves but become less obvious upon leaf expansion. for all plls, gus activity was strongest in those leaves that had initiated and were undergoing expansion, and weakest or not apparent in fully expanded leaves . the function of stipules in arabidopsis development remains largely unknown. however, it has been demonstrated that stipules are primary sites for the accumulation of auxin associated with vascular differentiation and leaf morphogenesis  <cit> . no gus activity was observed for any pll promoter in the apex after the transition to flowering .

base of flower/fruit pedicel
two pll promoters  drove gus activity within a restricted region on the adaxial side of the base of pedicels . for both, this was apparent after stage  <dig> of floral development, just before anthesis, and through development of the green silique . the pll <dig> and pll <dig> promoters, in addition to pll <dig> and pll <dig>  also drove gus activity at the base of trichomes on the leaf epidermis . in all cases, gus activity was limited to the stellate trichomes on the adaxial surface of rosette leaves, in the region roughly corresponding to basement cells, a group of specialized cells encircling the trichome and potentially serving as structural and/or biochemical support for the trichome .

flowers
gus activity was detected in developing flowers for all  <dig> of the pll promoters . none of the promoters studied showed strong activity before stage  <dig>  which is marked by appearance of stigmatic papillae  <cit>  . all except pll <dig> drove gus activity in varying domains within the style and/or stigma . some of these showed localized expression in the style , whereas others showed expression throughout the stigma , or in the basal portion of the stigma extending into the style . a potential function for pll genes expressed in the stigma and style is to facilitate pollen tube growth, via separation of transmitting tract cells and/or remodeling of cell walls in this tissue. in the stamen, several promoters drove activity in the filament , and/or throughout the anther and predominantly localized to pollen sacs and/or developing pollen . the subset of plls driving expression in pollen is largely consistent with that determined based on transcriptome analysis  or rt-pcr  <cit> . pll <dig> and pll <dig> were distinguished by driving gus activity in the stamen limited to the junction of the filament and anther . pll <dig> drove expression in the style in immature flowers , but by stage  <dig> this activity was not apparent, and instead gus staining was seen in developing seeds . activity of pll <dig> was not seen in ovules at stage  <dig> or earlier , or in developing seeds at stage  <dig> or later . we hypothesize that this seed-associated pattern is associated with the cellularization of the endosperm  <cit> .

correlation or divergence of pll promoter activity with patterns of rna accumulation
to evaluate the potential for regulation of pll genes outside of the context of promoter activity, we analyzed our findings in relation to previously reported transcriptional patterns based on microarray analysis of arabidopsis organs or whole structures   corresponded well with the stamen-associated pattern of mrna localization . however, pll <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> also showed strong promoter activity variously outside of flowers in the hypocotyl , root/hypocotyl junction , and stipules , regions where transcriptional profiling did not obviously predict promoter activity. genes expected to be transcriptionally quiescent based on microarray analysis, such as pll <dig> or pll <dig>  showed promoter activity that was relatively strong, and that was similar to genes that showed strong transcriptional signals such as pll <dig> or pll <dig>  respectively. pll <dig>  which might be expected to be constitutively expressed as a 'housekeeping' gene based on microarray analysis, showed promoter activity in only a subset of the regions analyzed . at least part of these apparent inconsistencies between promoter activity analysis and transcriptional profiling can be attributed to our qualitative representation of promoter activity, which is in reality a quantitative function. the lack of high values for mrna accumulation in structures  that include tissues with strong promoter activity  could be simply explained by the fact that such tissues make up only a small portion of the bulk of the regions subject to analysis. other cases where mrna levels are low in spite of strong regional promoter activity might be attributed to rapid mrna turnover. it is most difficult to explain the accumulation of mrnas in tissues or structures that lack detectable promoter activity, for example the strong and ubiquitous mrna expression of pll <dig>  in these cases regulatory elements required for appropriate expression might lay outside of the ~ <dig> kb 5' region utilized to direct gus expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we determined the temporal and regional promoter activity for members of the pll gene family during growth and development of arabidopsis. given the ubiquitous role of pectins in intercellular adhesion and cell wall architecture, and the various organismal processes that require targeted cell separation or cell wall remodeling, these genes are expected to be of fundamental importance.

we found that, as expected, promoter activity was common in cell types programmed for abscission, most obviously the perianth floral organ azs, the dz of the fruit, and the seed az. activity was also seen in regions, such as cell layers in the region of initiating lateral roots, where cell separation is expected but has not been well characterized. pectate lyase activity is expected to act in concert with other cell wall remodeling activities both to condition cell separation and to modify newly exposed cells for barrier functions. interestingly, we saw more limited pll promoter activity at the base of pedicels of flowers and fruits. cells in these regions can be artificially programmed to undergo separation in arabidopsis, in response to ectopic activity of the small abscission-associated peptide ida  <cit> , suggesting an abscission-related role. if these pll genes do have a cryptic function in flower/fruit abscission, abscission may be normally limited by the degree of pectate lyase activity or deficiency of other, cooperative, cell wall-modifying activities. interestingly, the two pll promoters driving activity in this region also were active in cells at the base of trichomes, suggesting their pedicel- and trichome-associated roles may be analogous. both regions are subject to mechanical stress imparted by movement of the pedicels/trichomes and an alternative function for these plls may be to participate in a pathway of cell wall remodeling to accommodate such stress.

other patterns of pll activity were difficult to explain given a function limited to cell separation, and might instead be associated with general cell wall remodeling accompanying growth and differentiation. the extensive and various activities seen in the root is a good example of this. we can not provide a simple explanation for the strong and widespread promoter activity in stipules; however, these structures are absorbed into the leaf periphery during leaf expansion and this process could be accompanied by radical changes in cell wall morphology. interestingly, both stipules and hydathodes were previously characterized as sites of high free auxin concentration during early leaf development  <cit> . a subset of pll promoters in our study were found to be actively associated with lateral root emergence, or in the region of the root apical meristem, other sites associated with local auxin concentration maxima  <cit> . these observations suggest a close functional relationship between these plls and auxin.

we note that many promoter activities of the pll genes are superficially similar to those exhibited collectively by several presumed polygalacturonase genes  <cit> . these include cases intuitively related to cell separation  and cases in which activity may be limited to cell wall remodeling . this implies close functional association between plls and pgs, which is expected given that both should target pectins.

an obvious use of data from high-throughput analyses of promoter activity and/or transcriptional profiles is to guide reversed-genetics analyses, especially where phenotypes are difficult to anticipate and/or where potential redundancy of the targeted genes is a limitation. the original intent of this project was to identify individual or small subsets of pll genes that might be targeted in this manner. however, the surprisingly high degree of overlap both in promoter activity and rna accumulation observed among the pll genes/promoters largely precluded this objective. we note that neither our promoter activity analysis nor previous microarray data would intuitively predict the documented non-redundant role for pll <dig>  in facilitating infection by powdery mildew  <cit> . this role is accomplished where infection occurs in leaf cells, where neither transcriptional profiling nor our promoter analysis suggested strong or non-redundant expression.

another obvious application of transcriptional data is the computational identification of dna regulatory elements linked to regionally or temporally specific expression patterns. here, it is noteworthy that the correlation between the transcriptional profiles previously established for these genes  <cit>  and their promoter activity  was apparently very limited. this justifies the additional time and expense necessary to accomplish comprehensive promoter activity profiles, and/or cell-type specific transcriptional profiling to define transcriptional regulatory elements.

the pll gene family is one of the largest and most complex in arabidopsis, suggesting enormous potential for gene specialization through spatial or temporal regulation. however, we found a remarkably high degree of overlap of activity among the pll promoters. the activity of  <dig> of the  <dig> tested plls in the stipules is an excellent example of this, as is the activity of at least  <dig> in the apparent azs of the sepals, petals and stamens at similar stages of development. this observation is surprising given that gene duplications should be evolutionarily stable only after having acquired a useful, non-redundant function. for plls, functional specificity may be bestowed by post-transcriptional and downstream mechanisms. such specificity might include regulation of rna stability. specificity might also be directed at the protein level, through potential differences in localization or mobility within the apoplast. alternatively, given the expected dynamic ph environment of the apoplast, the proteins might function only within a narrow ph window. finally, various pll proteins might show preference for specific pectin substrates, an intriguing possibility given the structural complexity of pectins. many of these possibilities could be addressed by the purification  and enzymatic characterization of individual plls.
