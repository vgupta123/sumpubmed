BACKGROUND
in addition to hypoxia and high levels of ultraviolet radiation, many aspects of high altitude environments put strong evolutionary pressures on resident species. extreme temperature and humidity fluctuation, highly endemic vegetation and fauna, and other biological factors relative to a species’ natural history, such as length or timing of the breeding season or level of population isolation can create strong adaptive pressure. understanding patterns and timing of genetic adaptations through organisms of different life histories is important to elucidate the commonalities in unique adaptation pathways that occur in extreme environments.

the feral horses of the high andean pàramo were originally brought with the spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. although most herds have been extirpated, small groups now called the párameros or cerreros persist in ecuador’s eastern range between the cotopaxi volcano and quilindaña. these horses came predominantly from andalusia, and had a mixture of jennet, andalusia, and berber ancestry. they quickly adapted to the andes, interbreeding naturally in small bands in isolation  <cit> , with the consequence that they present an ideal natural experiment in adaptation to high altitude conditions.

in addition to hypoxia, the highly inclement pàramo presents other physiologic and metabolic challenges. the pàramo is cold and humid with yearly rainfalls between  <dig> to over 3000 mm. extreme temperature fluctuations, with diurnal ranges from below freezing to up to 30c and periods of fog, heavy rain, hail or even snow dominate a good portion of the day during the rainy season. the dry season is very short. regular subzero temperatures, high uv radiation, and low ph soils have selected for an highly endemic alpine vegetation primarily consisting of tussock grasses, ground rosettes, dwarf shrubs, cushion plants and giant rosettes such as espeletia and puya  <cit> . although equus fossils have been found throughout the andes, all new world equids went extinct in the americas at the end of the pleistocene  <cit>  and in the high andes, the remaining large ungulates  shifted their center of distribution to the more temperate puna grasslands to the south  <cit> . the success of the introduced horses in the northern pàramo provides a unique model for looking at extreme hypoxic, thermoregulatory and metabolic adaptive pressure over a relatively short time span of ~ <dig> generations.

several recent genome wide studies have focused on human adaptation to hypoxia. comparisons of high-altitude tibetan populations with low-altitude han chinese populations uncovered strong signatures of selection in the hypoxia inducing factor  response pathway in the region of endothelial pas domain  <dig>   <cit> . several other genes in this pathway were also associated including peroxi-some proliferator-activated receptor-a   and egl  <dig> homolog  <dig>  , and the protein kinase, amp-activated a  <dig> catalytic subunit  . selection in the hif pathway is detected in most human studies; however, several other pathways such as methylation, pathogen resistance, or dna damage repair do not clearly overlap between study groups  <cit> . this could reflect differences in evolutionary paths, time scale, or other natural history variables that have not been elucidated yet.

as a large-bodied herbivore, the introduced andean horse provides a unique comparative perspective for further understanding whether the hif pathway is a universal target of natural selection for hypoxia, and how time, altitudinal ecosystem, and species life history influence genetic adaptation to extreme environments. this study explores which genomic regions appear to be under selection in the andean horse, and how these genes relate to previous studies and to the natural history of the horse and the páramo.

RESULTS
population structure
the feral population of horses is made up of several small bands located on lands adjacent to the cotopaxi national park, including hacienda yanahurco, a private wildlife reserve of ~ <dig> acres, and other unpopulated land to the south. the populations size fluctuates from ~ <dig> to over  <dig> individuals due to extreme weather fluctuations and removal of animals by wranglers.

horses are small in stature and many individuals exhibit the heritable “gaited” trait found in breeds such as the paso fino or mangalarga marchador. a principal component analysis indicated that the feral horses form a cluster close to these two breeds in pc <dig> , and they are a distinct cluster as defined by pc <dig> . several breeds form tight clusters , indicating either under strong artificial selection and/or a small number of founders. the general arrangement of the clusters reflected relationships illustrated in a larger prior analysis of breeds  <cit> .

genome wide allelic differentiation
using allelic genetic models for association,  <dig> snps in the feral andean horses show genetic divergence from the mixed breed sample below the bonferoni cut-off  as shown in the manhattan plot in figure  <dig> .  <dig> genes are located within the regions identified by these snps that may have been under strong selection once horses were introduced into the andes. table  <dig> lists the most significant ten associations, and each region of interest is discussed in turn below.

tenm <dig> and other nervous system genes
the most significant divergence in allele frequencies in the andean horse is found in the tenm <dig> gene, a member of the teneurin family of type ii tramsmembrane glycoproteins . this signal is also supported by fst analysis . the genes for teneurins are highly conserved across invertebrate and vertebrate species. the region on chromosome  <dig> in equus shares  <dig> % sequence identity with human tenm <dig>  and  <dig> % with chicken tenm <dig> .

teneurin proteins are proposed to regulate gene expression in the nervous system during development  <cit> . temn <dig> is involved in development of neuronal circuits in the visual system  <cit>  and has been shown to be expressed in the developing limbs, somites, and craniofacial mesenchyme  <cit> .

further support for the nervous system as a focus of adaptation in the feral andean horse population is that "neurological system process" was the most significantly represented category in a gene ontology biological processes analysis  . eighteen of  <dig> genes categorized in go fell into this category , including epas <dig>  hypoxia is implicated in several human central nervous system pathologies such as stroke or neurodegenerative disease and a connection between the hif pathway and neuronal response to hypoxia has been recognized  <cit> .  <dig> of the genes were in sensory perception, particularly olfaction, which may indicate that better sensory abilities are a benefit in the wild where individuals must locate mates, maintain herd structure, avoid predators and find appropriate food sources. in addition developmental and functional genes within the nervous system were significant.

the genes in this category are listed below. analysis was done with the human background that is more complete. entrez gene ids given are for homo sapiens.

cytochrome p <dig> genes
significant frequency divergences occur on chromosome  <dig> in a region containing several cytochrome p <dig>  3a genes . three snps show significant allele frequency divergence meeting the bonferoni correction of p < <dig> × 10- <dig> and three additional snps meet a lower cut-off of 10- <dig> . the snp biec2- <dig> is located within cyp3a93; however the entire horse cyp3a gene cluster consists of seven genes and one pseudogene in strong linkage disequilibrium covering a region of ~ <dig> kb. fst analyses also supported this region as a candidate of selection .

cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are a superfamily of membrane bound heme containing monooxygenases whose function is to catalyze the oxidation of organic substances. best known for their role in drug metabolism, cyps also are involved in hormone synthesis and breakdown, cholesterol synthesis, vitamin d metabolism, and metabolism of toxic compounds. the horse cyp3a gene cluster is more extensive than the human cyp cluster. it has been suggested that the horse cyp gene cluster is more complex because horses must digest a range of plant toxins in different habitats  <cit> . in the páramo ~ 60% of plant species are endemic and include largely bunchgrasses, shrubs, mosses and lichens which are highly evolved, likely in response to high uv, low ph soil and temperature and humidity fluctuation. this vegetation would differ greatly from that originally found in the habitats of the founding horses. it should be noted that members of this gene family were found in genome-wide hypoxia adaptation studies of tibetan human populations  <cit>  and frogs  <cit>  and experimental data from rabbits indicate hypoxemia up-regulates the expression of cyp3a <dig>  <cit> .

replication of associations between epas <dig> and life at high altitude
epas <dig> has been found to be associated with altitude in several studies of tibetans  <cit> . epas <dig> encodes a transcription factor involved in the induction of genes regulated by oxygen, which is induced as oxygen levels fall. in the horse, biec2– <dig>  was highly significant  as shown in figure  <dig>  this snp is an intronic snp with no known function. it has been suggested that in tibetans, the association between epas <dig> expression and lower hb levels is an adaptive response that lowers hypoxia-induced erythropoeisis in tibetans such that the negative effects of this hypoxia response do not occur  <cit> . a more in-depth follow-up study will be needed to confirm the result and elucidate the exact mechanism for the difference, but the commonality of this gene association in horses with the studies in humans is intriguing.

other signals
other genes with high allele frequency differences within the andean herd include lingo <dig>  which was recently associated with bmi  <cit>  and parkinson disease  <cit> , and a region containing ubiquitin protein ligase e <dig> component n-recognin  <dig> , sp <dig> transcription factor, glutamate decarboxylase  <dig>  and myosin iiib . solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig>   is part of the slc22a gene family that mediates the absorption, distribution, and excretion of a diverse array of environmental toxins  <cit> .

most fst signals reflected the significant association signals. the highest region of allele frequency divergence as measured by fst was observed on chromosome  <dig> , and contained the following genes: tom1l <dig>  cox <dig>  stxbp <dig>  hlf, mmd, tmem <dig>  and pctp. the fst data was corroborated by a highly significant association found between cox11/stxbp <dig> . these two genes have been explored for their association to human breast cancer in several studies  <cit> . they are in strong ld in both humans and horses. cox <dig> is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein and the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. cox <dig> has been found to be up-regulated in chronic hypoxia of cyanotic patients undergoing repair of heart defects, suggesting a role in dealing with lack of oxygen, possibly by acting as an heme biosynthetic enzyme which transports copper to heme a  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
several large allelic divergences between the feral andean horses and a comparison group of primarily iberian horse breeds have been observed in this study. many of the genes identified in this study appear to be biologically relevant, however one cannot rule out type  <dig> error due to genetic drift or the composition of the comparison group. a recent study of artificial selection in  <dig> horse breeds found strong selection for aesthetics and performance traits resulted in high homozygosity within breeds and large divergence between breeds  <cit> . the andean population was likely founded by a mixed sample of iberian breeds; however, by combining the descendants of those breeds in the comparison group, many of which have undergone strong subsequent artificial selection since their introduction to the americas, one effectively makes a comparison to a more heterogeneous out-group. this may increase the potential for false positives. the replication of the significance of the epas <dig> loci suggests that many genes found in this study are the result of strong selection in the wild population. the replication of this signal in a large herbivore in a relatively short evolutionary time span further implicates hif- response pathway as essential to high altitude. additional signals in the nervous system and the cytochrome-p <dig> gene family, which may be in response to the local endemic plants, suggest that high altitude adaptation is complicated, and that life history of the species in question and local ecology of the environment are both important factors in evolutionary adaptation.
