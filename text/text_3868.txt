BACKGROUND
the plant vascular system, which includes xylem and phloem tissues, connects different parts of the plant body and is of great importance for mechanical support as well as the transport of water, nutrients and photosynthesized compound. monocots and dicots have developed different vascular systems  <cit> . most monocots, which produce scattered vascular bundles, only develop primary growth, whereas woody plants usually develop secondary vascular systems through secondary growth. several stages of development are common across different vascular systems including: differentiation of procambium or cambium cells, elongation of tracheary elements and sieve cells, and secondary wall formation in vascular sclerenchyma cells  <cit> . these shared processes suggest vascular development may be regulated by a set of underlying molecular mechanisms.

arabidopsis thaliana, a typical herbaceous dicot, has been employed as a model plant to study the molecular mechanisms regulating the initiation, development and regulation of the vascular system. a number of important transcriptional regulators have been discovered using the arabidopsis model system  <cit> . for example, monopteros  is an auxin response factor required for the establishment of vascular tissues  <cit> . apl encodes a myb transcription factor crucial for phloem identity in the root  <cit> . hd-zipiiis and kans are two distinct classes of transcription factors that regulate differentiation of xylem and phloem tissues from procambium cells  <cit> . vnd <dig> and vnd <dig>  two nac family genes, promote xylem vessel cell formation  <cit> . snd <dig> and nst <dig>  also members of the nac family, regulate secondary wall biosynthesis  <cit> . the identification of these molecular mechanisms in arabidopsis may be used to shed light on analogous processes in monocots and woody plants.

recent research suggests genes involved in the same pathway tend to be transcriptionally coordinated  <cit> . transcriptome profiling and analysis of gene coexpression can uncover functional connections as well as identify molecular pathways between genes  <cit> . for example, networks involved in cell wall formation were identified through coexpression analysis of transcriptomes across different plant species  <cit> . here we report an analysis of the transcriptomes in three types of vascular plants  to identify the essential genes and processes needed for vascular development.

RESULTS
identification of conserved vascular genes across various vascular systems
vascular associated genes from three vascular systems were identified by comparative transcriptome analysis. microarray data from  <dig> arabidopsis tissues,  <dig> poplar tissues and  <dig> rice tissues were analyzed . in each species, vascular associated genes satisfied two criteria. first, its expression value in the stem had to be higher than in any other tissue  and second, its expression value had to be at least twice as high as the geometric mean value of all tissues analysed. consequently,  <dig> genes  in arabidopsis,  <dig> genes  in poplar and  <dig> genes  in rice met the criteria .

the identified vascular associated genes were further analyzed in parallel for the presence of orthologs across the three vascular systems.  <dig> genes in arabidopsis,  <dig> genes in poplar and  <dig> genes in rice were identified to be conserved across the three species by the blast program with e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig> . these conserved vascular genes  can be categorized into  <dig> groups , consisting of sets of orthologs performing functions which may be essential to vascular development .

cvgs are preferentially expressed in vascular tissues
heatmaps were generated from the cvg expression values  after normalization across various tissues . cvg expression was enriched in the stem, moderate in the root, and low in leaves, a pattern reflecting their primary activity in the vascular system. since vascular tissues contain different cell types, we further tested whether cvg expression is enriched in xylem, phloem or cambium cells.  <dig> of the  <dig> cvgs detected in arabidopsis were examined in a previous study   <cit> .  <dig> of those cvgs were found to be expressed in xylem, phloem or cambium.  <dig> of the  <dig> genes showed preferential expression within vascular tissues toward xylem versus  <dig> genes toward phloem-cambium, indicating that xylem development may involve more cvgs than phloem.

cvgs form a complex coexpression network
the vascular cvgs were analyzed through coexpression analysis programs  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> cvgs in arabidopsis displayed coexpression relationships in a complex network . these cvgs formed  <dig> clusters, indicating that a coordinated system of multiple networks is involved in vascular development. of the  <dig> clusters, cluster  <dig> is the largest and consists of  <dig> genes . both cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> consist of  <dig> genes. cluster  <dig> has  <dig> genes and the remaining clusters contain  <dig> or  <dig> genes.

although many transcription factors have been identified as regulators of vascular development, their signal transduction networks remain largely uncharacterized  <cit> . specific genes stood out in cluster  <dig> due to their association with key transcription factors. transcription factors snd <dig>  snd <dig>  nst <dig> and myb <dig> are connected in cluster  <dig> . they are closely coexpressed with genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis, consistent with the central role that these transcription factors play in regulating secondary wall formation  <cit> . interestingly, iqd <dig>  is also connected in the cluster forming direct links with snd <dig>  nst <dig> and myb <dig>  the function of iqd <dig> is unknown. electronic annotations suggest iqd <dig> contains a plant-specific iqd domain and is a putative calmodulin target protein mediating calcium signals  <cit> . the coexpression analysis suggests iqd <dig> is likely involved in signaling pathways needed for secondary cell wall formation.

at5g <dig>  which contains a domain of unknown function  is another intriguing gene in cluster  <dig>  at5g <dig> is closely coexpressed with genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis such as irx <dig>  irx <dig>  irx <dig>  gut <dig>  gaut <dig> and lac <dig>  <cit> . secondary cell walls contain mainly cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. the biosynthesis and modification of these carbohydrate-based cell wall components involves highly coordinated processes among a large suite of genes with specialized functions  <cit> . at5g <dig> may play a novel, yet to be elucidated role in the process of secondary cell wall biosynthesis.

cluster  <dig> also includes rop <dig>  which belongs to a family of rho-related gtpase  that is critical for regulating cytoskeleton organization in plants  <cit> . rop family genes have been speculated to participate in vascular development by regulating secondary wall patterns formation in xylem  <cit> . gfp-rop <dig> was found to be localized at the plasma membrane in differentiating xylem cells in culture. histochemical analysis of rop7: gus demonstrated that rop <dig> is preferentially expressed in developing xylem cells with partially thickened secondary walls  <cit> . here, rop <dig> is found in the coexpression cluster with secondary wall biosynthesis genes, supporting its potential functions during secondary wall formation. cluster  <dig> also contains several protein kinases and leucine-rich repeat protein kinases  which are typically involved in signal perception and mediation  <cit> . their appearance suggests the presence of signal transduction pathways in vascular development which have yet to be investigated.

the  <dig> members of cluster  <dig> include 4cl, ccr <dig>  cad <dig>  c3h, omt <dig>  pal <dig> and pal <dig> . these genes encode key enzymes which catalyse the biosynthesis of monolignols  <cit> . this suggests lignin biosynthesis is conserved across the different vascular systems. however, since the monolignol catalysing genes from cluster  <dig> are less coexpressed with cellulose and xylan biosynthesis genes in cluster  <dig> , the two biosynthesis pathways are likely have different regulatory mechanisms.

enriched go terms of cvgs reflect important cellular and biochemical processes
vascular development includes several critical stages including polarized cell differentiation, cell elongation and secondary wall formation  <cit> . go analysis indicates that cvg activity is significantly enriched  in the following processes: cellular component biogenesis, metabolic process, microtubule-based cell organization, peptide transportation, and cell surface receptor linked signaling processes .

cellular component biogenesis includes secondary cell wall biosynthesis, an outstanding feature during vascular development. metabolic process is mainly related to aromatic compound biosynthesis responsible for lignin formation. these two enriched processes indicate the biosynthesis of lignin and secondary wall components are both highly conserved in vascular development. peptide transport and microtubule-based processes are responsible for protein transport and cytoskeleton organization, which are crucial for cell wall formation and cell development. cell surface receptor linked signaling pathway is another enriched process, indicating busy signal transduction during vascular formation. mapping cvgs to their enriched go terms provides a basic roadmap of the important processes involved in vascular development.

cvg groups represent  <dig> fundamental processes during vascular development
experimental descriptions were used to link cvg groups to general biological processes. of the  <dig> cvg groups, only a half  has experimental annotations  which can be categorized into  <dig> fundamental processes : cell organization and biogenesis, cell wall formation, developmental process, metabolic process, response to abiotic and biotic stimulus, response to hormones, signal transduction pathway, transcriptional regulation and transport. the other  <dig> groups have not been described experimentally and only have electronic annotations . among these,  <dig> fall into the  <dig> existing processes while  <dig> groups  are involved in undefined processes .

transcriptional regulation
 <dig> cvg groups which have experimental annotations fall in the category of transcriptional regulation process. among them  <dig> cvg groups encode transcription factors: hd-zip iiis, knoxs, nacs and mybs, respectively . their vascular-enriched expression pa-ttern was verified by qrt-pcr analysis . in arabidopsis, hd-zip iiis display a complex pattern of overlapping functions  <cit>  and regulate vascular patterning by promoting the differentiation of procambium cells into xylem  <cit> . in poplar, hd-zipiii genes popcorona and poprevoluta play a role in regulating cell differentiation and patterning of vascular tissues  <cit> , while ptrhb <dig> regulates secondary vascular differentiation in a dosage dependent manner  <cit> . brevipedicellus , which is a member of the knox gene family in arabidopsis, maintains cells in an indeterminate state through negatively regulating secondary cell wall metabolism  <cit> . similar functions were observed in a poplar ortholog, arborknox <dig> . overexpression of ark <dig> showed delayed cell differentiation and misregulation of cell wall biosynthesis-related genes. suppression of ark <dig> enhanced development of secondary xylem and phloem fibers  <cit> . these indicate knox family members are conserved and necessary for cell differentiation. nac and myb are transcription factors that play a key role in activating the secondary wall biosynthetic program in arabidopsis <cit> . nacs and mybs have also been shown to regulate secondary wall biosynthesis in trees such as poplar and eucalyptus, and in grass species including rice and maize  <cit> . as expected, our results also indicate that nacs and mybs are crucial transcriptional regulators in the three vascular systems and perhaps throughout vascular plants.

signal transduction pathway
only  <dig> of the  <dig> cvg groups involved in the signal transduction pathway have been experimentally described. the cvgs include several signal pathway components including pxy, a receptor of polypeptide signaling molecule cle <dig>  <cit> . in arabidopsis, pxy functions in meristematic cells of procambium. its knockout mutant displays loss of ordered cell division patterns in procambium zone  <cit> . the binding of polypeptide cle <dig>  which is secreted from phloem, to pxy is believed to regulate the orientation of procambium cell division  <cit> . the interaction between pxy and cle <dig> is likely to be a common mechanism to promote polarized cell division. in addition, the cvgs include iqd <dig> which is involved in calcium signaling. coexpression analysis indicates it networks with secondary wall biosynthetic genes. a homologous gene, iqd <dig>  was found to be calmodulin-binding and mainly expressed in vascular tissues  <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr analysis of iqd <dig> confirmed its enriched expression pattern in vascular tissues . these results suggest calcium signaling may be involved in vascular development. continued characterization of the cvgs will help to identify additional signal transduction pathways embedded in vascular development.

cell wall formation
cell wall formation includes  <dig> cvg groups , reflecting the fact that cell wall biosynthesis is a major process during vascular development. irx <dig>  irx <dig> and irx <dig> in group  <dig> encode cellulose synthase  which catalyses cellulose synthesis in cell walls  <cit> . hemicellulose biosynthesis genes, parvus, gut <dig> and gaut <dig> <cit> , and lignin biosynthesis genes, 4cls and laccases  <cit>  are also contained in the cell wall formation process. gut <dig>  gaut <dig> and laccases form a closely coexpressed cluster, highlighting their critical roles in cell wall biosynthesis. in addition, several cvgs such as chitinase-like proteins and pectinesterases are particularly involved in primary wall formation. quantitative rt-pcr analysis reinforces the conserved roles of the cvgs in diverse vascular systems .

response to hormones
 <dig> cvg groups involved in response to hormones have experimental annotations . group  <dig> encodes short-lived transcriptional repressor aux/iaa that interacts with auxin response factors  <cit> . according to the auxin canalization hypothesis, vascular initiation is regulated by directional auxin flows  <cit> . hence, aux/iaas are likely to be involved in the response of early auxin signals during vascular system initiation. response to auxin stimulus is enriched in above go analysis and several auxin response factors are included in cvgs . this indicates the likelihood that a conserved mechanism exists to mediate the detection of auxin signals. the proposed role of aux/iaa orthologs in the vascular development of the three species is supported by quantitative analysis of their expression patterns .

cell organization and biogenesis
quantitative expression analysis demonstrated group  <dig> genes are transcriptionally enriched in vascular systems . microtubule-associated protein  <dig>  from group  <dig> is associated with cell organization and biogenesis. critical functions of map <dig> can be deduced from zemap65- <dig>  a homologous gene preferentially expressed in xylogenic zinnia mesophyll cells. overexpression of zemap65- <dig> in arabidopsis suspension cells induces dramatic changes in cortical microtubule bundles  <cit> . this suggests map <dig> family genes may play a conserved role in assembly of microtubules during tracheary elements formation.

other fundamental processes
the fundamental processes concluded from go analysis also include developmental process , metabolic process , transport , and response to abiotic or biotic stimulus . although enriched and conserved across the three vascular systems, these cvg groups may not directly participate in vascular development. for example, cvgs in metabolic process include enzymes from various biochemical pathways , which may indirectly affect the vascular development.

undefined process
 <dig> cvg groups had uncharacterized functions and were classified under the undefined process. although the roles of these genes have yet to be determined, the potential for them to play an important role in vascular development should not be overlooked. for example, the groups include several duf-containing proteins  such as duf <dig> and duf <dig> which are preferentially expressed in vascular tissues . recently, the duf <dig> gene family was reported to play a role in xylan biosynthesis during cell wall formation. mutants of two duf <dig> genes exhibited distorted xylem vessels as a result of reduced xylan content  <cit> . a member of the duf <dig> family was shown to encode a glucuronoxylan methyltransferase that catalyzes 4-o-methylation of the glucuronic acid substituents  <cit> . like duf <dig> proteins, the cvg groups in the undefined process may play essential roles in the  <dig> fundamental processes of vascular development.

CONCLUSIONS
we used comparative transcriptome analysis to identify the essential genes and biological processes underpinning vascular development.  <dig> genes, which can be categorized into  <dig> fundamental processes, were found to be conserved across three different vascular systems. these results can help to facilitate the transfer of learnings from arabidopsis to different grass and tree species. in addition, our analysis surfaced many conserved genes whose functions have yet to be characterized experimentally. a more comprehensive mapping of the principal mechanisms underlying vascular formation could reveal new avenues for the engineering of plants with desired body structure and improved biomass production.
