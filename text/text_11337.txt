BACKGROUND
cells are exposed to changing environmental conditions that can cause cellular stress. stress-inducing situations include severe variations of the cellular energy budget, altered concentration of specific ions and also conditions that induce dna damage. in case of dna damage, cell cycle arrest or illegitimate dna rearrangements, cell death or carcinogenesis can occur if cellular systems fail to repair the dna properly  <cit> . as a consequence, the integrity of the genome is threatened. response mechanisms of cells to genotoxic stress include directed intracellular trafficking of specific proteins mediated commonly by posttranslational modifications as well as formation of specific protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in a recent study, we showed a functional cooperation of s100a <dig> with the repair machinery at sites of dna double-strand breaks   <cit> . s100a <dig> belongs to the family of s <dig> proteins which are considered as multitasking proteins involved in several biological processes such as the ca2+ signalling network, cell growth and motility, cell cycle progression, transcription and cell differentiation  <cit> . it has been proposed that the s <dig> proteins are involved in the differentiation of specific tissues and that some members of this family are differentially expressed in normal human skin and melanocytic lesions  <cit> . s <dig> proteins are expressed in a cell and tissue specific manner  <cit> . in several studies, s100a <dig> was shown to be up- or down-regulated in different tumor entities  <cit> . s100a <dig> plays a dual role in growth regulation of human keratinocytes as it is able to mediate a ca2+-induced growth inhibition as well as growth stimulation by enhancement of the level of egf protein family members  <cit> . interestingly, the stimulation of the activity of the cell cycle regulator p21waf1/cip <dig> by potential cellular stress stimuli such as increase of extracellular ca2+ concentration as well as induction of dna damage can be mediated by s100a <dig> through a p <dig> independent mechanism  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to gain further mechanistic insight into the role of s100a <dig> cellular trafficking during the dna damage response pathway.

methods
cell culture
the human keratinocyte cell line hacat  <cit>  and human u- <dig> os osteosarcoma cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were grown to 80% confluence and passaged at a split ratio of 1: <dig>  for western blot experiments, cells were harvested at 70-90% confluency and lysed in a buffer containing  <dig> mm sodium phosphate ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> % chaps,  <dig> μm leupeptin, and  <dig>  mm pmsf. after centrifugation  the supernatant was immediately applied to sds-page. preparations of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions were performed using the protojet cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction kit  according to the manufactor's instructions.

construction of the gfp-s100a <dig> plasmid
an s100a <dig> construct from a pgex-2t-s100a <dig> vector  was pcr amplified using following primers: 5'-gcttcgaattctatggcaaaaatctccagccc-3'  and 5'-ggtggatccggtccgcttctgggaaggga-3' . the pcr fragment was cloned between the ecor <dig> and bamh <dig> restriction site of pegfp-c <dig> . correct insertion of s100a <dig> was confirmed by sequencing.

sirna mediated knockdown of nucleolin
small interfering rna  duplex oligonucleotides used in this study are based on the human cdnas encoding nucleolin. nucleolin sirna as well as a non-silencing control sirna were obtained from qiagen gmbh . the sirna sequence applied to target nucleolin was 5'-aag aac gtg gct gag gat gaa-3'. the sirna sequences employed as negative controls were 5'-uuc ucc gaa cgu guc acg udtdt-3'  and 5'-acg uga cac guu cgg aga adtdt-3' . hacat cells  were plated on 6-well plates  <dig> hours prior to transfection and were 50% confluent when sirna was added. the amount of sirna duplexes applied was  <dig>  μg/well for nucleolin. transfection was performed using the amphiphilic delivery system saint-red  as described  <cit> . briefly, sirna was complexed with  <dig> nmol of transfection reagent and added to the cells for  <dig> hours. subsequently,  <dig> ml of culture medium was added and incubation proceeded for  <dig> hours.

antibodies for immunofluorescence-based microscopy
anti-s100a <dig> chicken polyclonal antibody , anti-nucleolin mouse monoclonal antibody  and anti-γh2ax rabbit polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the c-terminus of human γh2ax were used in two- or three-color immunofluorescence staining as primary antibodies which were detected with species-specific secondary antibodies linked to fluorescein, cy <dig> or cy <dig> .

immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy
cells grown on coverslips were fixed by treatment with methanol at -20°c for  <dig> min followed by acetone  for  <dig> min, or by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> min at room temperature followed by 25% triton-x  <dig> for  <dig> min. immunofluorescence was performed as previously described  <cit> . samples were scanned with a zeiss lsm  <dig> laser scanning confocal device attached to an axioplan  <dig> microscope using a 63× plan-apochromat oil objective . fluorescein, cy <dig> or cy <dig> dyes were excited by laser light at a 488-, 552-, or 633-nm wavelength, respectively. to avoid bleed-through effects in double or triple staining experiments, each dye was scanned independently using the multitracking function of the lsm  <dig> unit. single optical sections were selected either by eye-scanning the sample in z axis for optimal fluorescence signals, or selected from z-stacks. images were electronically merged using the lsm  <dig>  software and stored as tiff files. figures were assembled from the tiff files using adobe photoshop software.

induction of dna damages by bleomycin 
cells were seeded in 6-well plates on cover slips for  <dig> hours. dmem supplemented with 10% fcs was exchanged to fresh dmem supplemented with 10% fcs and cells were treated with  <dig>  iu/ml blm. medium was exchanged after  <dig> minutes and cells were analyzed after different time points. dna double-strand breaks  were visualized by immunofluorescence using a specific antibody against γh2ax. h2ax becomes phosphorylated as one of the first cellular responses after dna damage and forms foci at sites of dsbs  <cit> .

quantification of s100a <dig> translocation
the gfp-s100a <dig> fluorescence signal was quantified from maximum intensity projections of 3-d image stacks of u- <dig> os cells treated with blm for  <dig> min or in untreated control cells, quantification was done with metamorph analysis software . fluorescence intensity of gfp-s100a <dig> in five cytoplasmic areas  localized along a straight line from the nuclear membrane to the cellular periphery in four different directions based on the nuclear membrane as well as of three areas randomly selected in the nucleus was measured.

western blot
proteins of interest in crude extracts of u- <dig> os and hacat cells treated with specific nucleolin sirna or unspecific control sirna were verified using specific antibodies against nucleolin , actin , s100a <dig> , ku <dig> , tubulin , and p <dig>  by western blot assays as described.

qrt-pcr
hacat cells transfected with specific nucleolin or control sirna were treated with blm  for  <dig> h. total rna was extracted using an rna isolation kit  and first strand synthesis was synthesized using a kit system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the mrna level of the p <dig> gene was estimated by quantitative real-time pcr using specific primers: p <dig> fwd 5' ctg tca ctg tct tgt acc ctt gt 3'; p <dig> rev 5' ctt cct gtg ggc gga tta g 3'. the ct value of the p <dig> gene was normalized to actin.

colony forming assay
to assess the survival rate of cells after bleomycin treatment,  <dig> hacat cells were seeded into 6-well dishes. after  <dig> hours, the cells were treated with different concentrations of the drug and cultured for another ten days. in control treatments, single cells had formed colonies of about  <dig> cells after that time. colonies were than washed once with pbs, fixed with methanol for  <dig> min, stained with giemsa dye, and finally air-dried. the number of colonies formed was then determined.

RESULTS
nuclear translocation of s100a <dig> is induced by stress stimuli
it was shown recently that s100a <dig> is involved in the detection of dna double-strand breaks  by the dna repair machinery  <cit> . when human hacat keratinocytes were treated with bleomycin , a dna double-strand break -inducing agent, an increased accumulation of s100a <dig> at discrete foci in the nucleus, accompanied by a decreased staining in the cytoplasm was detectable compared to untreated control cells . consistent with previous observations  <cit> , we detected a distribution of endogenous s100a <dig> in a dot-like pattern in the nucleus of dna damaged cells. this behaviour of s100a <dig> is reminiscent of its nuclear translocation induced by high ca2+ as reported previously  <cit> . quantification of the s100a <dig> cellular redistribution was not possible in hacat cells due to the small cytoplasmic volume. we therefore used human osteosarcoma  cells which, in contrast to hacat cells, have a large cytoplasmic volume. because u- <dig> os cells express only very little endogenous s100a <dig> , we quantified the translocation event in cells expressing gfp-tagged s100a <dig>  to simultaneously investigate whether other cellular stress stimuli are also able to induce a directed translocation of the gfp-s100a <dig> into the nucleus we treated the cells with extracellular ca2+ or bleomycin . similar to endogenous s100a <dig> in hacat cells, the gfp-s100a <dig> construct was translocated into the nucleus of u- <dig> os cells by ca2+ as well as blm treatment . interestingly, introduction of dsbs by blm was more effective than ca2+ in induction of s100a <dig> nuclear translocation as assessed in a kinetic approach. an almost complete translocation of gfp-s100a <dig> into the nucleus of u- <dig> os cells was induced  <dig> minutes after blm treatment compared to addition of ca2+ which triggered only a partial translocation to the perinuclear region at this time point. a significant translocation of s100a <dig> occurred only after  <dig> hours after ca2+ treatment. this observation suggests that the dynamics of cellular s100a <dig> redistribution is stress type dependent. the translocation of gfp-s100a <dig> was specific as cells transfected with gfp alone showed a random cellular distribution pattern of the gfp signal after induction of dna damage by blm .

to quantify the directed translocation of s100a <dig> from the cytoplasm into the nucleus we defined five circled areas  localized along a line from the nuclear membrane to the cellular periphery as well as areas  randomly selected in the nucleus . altogether, a cytosolic area of at least  <dig> μm in distance to the nuclear membrane was analyzed by this approach. the average fluorescence intensity of the gfp-s100a <dig> signal of the five specific cytosolic areas was determined radially in four different cytosolic directions based on the nuclear membrane and in the nuclear areas using metamorph software  <dig> minutes after treatment with blm . with this approach we detected an increase of gfp-s100a <dig> signal in the nucleus of dna damaged u- <dig> os cells compared to control cells. simultaneously, the gfp-s100a <dig> signal decreased in the cytoplasm of blm-treated cells. the effect was observed in the peripheral cytosolic area. thus, induction of dna damage by blm triggers a directed translocation of s100a <dig> from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. in contrast, the distribution of gfp-s100a <dig> was almost similar in various locations throughout the cytoplasm of untreated control cells . furthermore, a similar nuclear translocation of s100a <dig> after introduction of dsbs was also detectable in another cell line . these data demonstrate that dna damage is a powerful stress stimulus to activate a directed translocation of s100a <dig> into the nucleus of human cells.

nuclear translocation of s100a <dig> is mediated by nucleolin
nucleolin has been previously implicated in the cellular translocation of s100a <dig> after treatment with extracellular ca2+  <cit> . we therefore analyzed the role of nucleolin in dna damage-induced s100a <dig> nuclear accumulation. a prerequisite of the nuclear transport of s100a <dig> is a specific phosphorylation of s100a <dig> by pkcα which is activated by high ca2+  <cit> . phoshorylation of s100a <dig> triggers its binding to nucleolin. nucleolin is involved in several cellular processes such as ribosomal assembly and maturation, signal transformation as well as shuttling activities  <cit> . therefore, we assessed if nucleolin is also involved in a directed translocation of s100a <dig> induced by dna damage. the induction of dsbs by blm caused in gfp-s100a <dig> transfected u- <dig> os cells a redistribution of a fraction of cellular nucleolin to the perinuclear region . redistribution was absent in control cells containing gfp-s100a <dig> without blm treatment. a higher degree of colocalization was detected between gfp-s100a <dig> and nucleolin in the perinuclear region of blm treated cells which was not detectable in controls . again, an increased distribution of gfp-s100a <dig> in perinuclear regions and nucleus appeared after induction of dna damage. to confirm that nucleolin is able to specifically transfer the poshosphorylated form of s100a <dig> into the nucleus, pkcα was inhibited using a myristoylated pkc inhibitor  <cit> . the cellular distribution of gfp-s100a <dig> and nucleolin was then examined by immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. because specific phosphorylation of s100a <dig> is a prerequisite for nuclear transfer triggered by a high ca2+ stimulus, we expected that the phosphorylation event may be also necessary for s100a <dig> translocation into the nucleus induced by dna damages. in u- <dig> os cells containing damaged dna, gfp-s100a <dig> was translocated directly into the nucleus again. in contrast, in dna damaged cells incubated with the pkc inhibitor only very little gfp-s100a <dig> was detectable in the nucleus. gfp fluorescence intensity in these cells was similar to control cells . the altered cellular distribution of gfp-s100a <dig> after treatment with blm and/or the myristoylated pkc inhibitor is also reflected by the distinct gfp-s100a <dig> pattern in cytoplasmic as well as nuclear cell fractions . to evaluate the influence of nucleolin on the nuclear translocation of endogenous s100a <dig> more specifically, nucleolin was depleted in hacat cells using sirna . the amount of nuclear s100a <dig> was quantified in hacat keratinocytes under several conditions. a significant increase of nuclear s100a <dig> was detectable in cells with damaged dna compared to untreated control cells. the increase of endogenous s100a <dig> in the nucleus is comparable to the amount of translocated gfp-s100a <dig> into nuclei of u- <dig> os cells triggered by dna damage. additionally, we found similar intensities of nuclear s100a <dig> in nucleolin-depleted cells and in control cells. induction of dna dsbs by blm in cells lacking nucleolin did result in an only slightly intensified translocation of endogenous s100a <dig> into the nucleus compared to untreated cells lacking nucleolin .

impeded nuclear translocation of s100a <dig> inhibits cell proliferation
recently, we showed that the depletion of s100a <dig> leads to an inhibition of dna damage-induced up-regulation of the cell cycle regulator p <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we were interested whether inhibition of s100a <dig> translocation into nuclei after depletion of nucleolin also induces a decrease of p <dig>  hacat cells transfected with specific nucleolin sirna were treated with blm to induce dna dsbs for  <dig> min or left untreated. this analysis revealed a significant reduction of p <dig> protein levels in nucleolin-depleted cells . the reduction of p <dig> was independent of blm treatment in hacat cells. these observations demonstrate that nucleolin-directed translocation of s100a <dig> into the nucleus is required for the induction of p <dig> and confirm our previous results  <cit> . consistent with these data, the transcriptional activation of p <dig> gene expression was also decreased in hacat cells lacking nucleolin . additionally, the p <dig> protein level was decreased when s100a <dig> phosphorylation was inhibited in cells treated with blm . finally, we determined the proliferation capacity of nucleolin depleted hacat cells in colony-forming assays . a significant decrease of the colony forming capacity of cells lacking nucleolin was observed . nucleolin depletion also induced an increase of the subg1/apoptotic fraction by a factor of three in facs analyses . similar results were previously obtained after s100a <dig> knock-down  <cit> , supporting our conclusion that nucleolin and s100a <dig> function in concert during dna damage response pathways.

discussion
s <dig> proteins are involved in ca2+-modulated signal transduction pathways  <cit> . a translocation of s100a <dig> induced by ca2+ as a cellular stress stimulus might be a key mechanism to regulate the formation of specific signalling complexes in a spatially and temporally regulated manner  <cit> . the data reported in the present study indicate a direct translocation of s100a <dig> into the nucleus induced by dna damage. recently, we showed that s100a <dig> seems to be involved in dna repair processes because it functionally interacts with rad54b which is involved in homologous recombination  <cit> . this interaction targets rad54b to sites of dna double-strand break  repair. several members of the s <dig> protein family are transcriptionally regulated by factors involved in both, dna damage repair and cell cycle control  <cit> . additionally, it was also shown that the expression of s100a <dig>  a further s <dig> family protein, was stimulated by uv-a radiation in a mouse model  <cit> . directed translocation of proteins seems to be a general response to different cellular stress stimuli, including s <dig> family members  <cit> . such nucleo/cytoplasmic translocations occur in both directions. we have shown here that nuclear translocation of s100a <dig> was triggered not only by ca2+ as previously described, but also by dna damage. the accumulation of s100a <dig> in nuclei was more effective after dna damage compared to the ca2+ stimulus. this may be related to very strong stress signals usually associated with dna breaks. the s100a <dig> translocation triggered by dna damage is, at least partly, mediated by nucleolin . nucleolin was described as a shuttling protein which is involved in directed translocation into the nucleus of several proteins  <cit> . interestingly, a redistribution of nucleolin from nucleoli to perinuclear regions as well as a colocalization between s100a <dig> and nucleolin in these regions after treatment with the dna damaging agent blm occurred as shown in the present study. depletion of nucleolin by rna interference as well as inhibition of s100a <dig> phosphorylation by a myristoylated pkc inhibitor inhibited the directed translocation of s100a <dig> into the nucleus in dna damaged cells. nevertheless, as minor s100a <dig> signal intensities still appeared in cells lacking nucleolin or cells incubated with the pkc inhibitor, it is tempting to speculate about the existence of further nuclear transfer mechanisms for s100a <dig>  additionally, it is conceivable that endogenous s100a <dig> as well as the s100a11-gfp fusion is able to diffuse passively into the nucleus due to its small molecular size.

after induction of the nuclear translocation of s100a <dig> by dna damage in hacat keratinocytes the protein level of the cell cycle regulator p <dig> increased significantly. these data are consistent with recently published results showing an increased p <dig> protein level in dna damaged cells  <cit> . the activation of p <dig> must be p <dig> independent as hacat cells possess only an inactive form of p <dig> that is not able to induce p <dig>  <cit> . our present data indicate that s100a <dig> is responsible for the regulation of the p <dig> level in hacat cells. the regulation of p <dig> in a p <dig> independent manner seems to correlate with depletion of s100a <dig> as shown elsewhere  <cit>  or inhibition of the s100a <dig> translocation into the nucleus as shown here. our studies also revealed that depletion of nucleolin inhibits transcriptional activation of the p <dig> gene. this was not expected because data of sakaguchi et al. suggested that a transcriptional activator of p <dig>  sp <dig>  can be liberated from nucleolin by the binding of nuclear s100a <dig> to nucleolin  <cit> . we suggest that p <dig> may be controlled under these circumstances by an as yet unknown mechanism that involves s100a <dig>  finally, we have shown that reduced s100a <dig> levels in the nucleus diminished the proliferation capacity of hacat keratinocytes. since p <dig> can act as an inhibitor of apoptosis  <cit>  it is not surprising that the decrease of nuclear s100a <dig> followed by reduction of p <dig> induced an increased apoptotic cell fraction.

CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of these data it seems that s100a <dig> is able to mediate a cellular stress stimulus induced by dna damage by nucleolin-mediated translocation into the nucleus and regulation of p <dig> activity.
