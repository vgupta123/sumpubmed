BACKGROUND
the bovine genome was one of the first mammalian genomes sequenced, likely because cattle are important farm animals serving as major nutritional sources for humans and because of their evolutionary position as a representative of the ruminantia, a phylogenetically distant clade to humans and rodents  <cit> . the bovine genome sequencing consortium sequenced a single inbred female hereford cow and her sire using a combination of hierarchical sequencing and whole-genome shotgun sequencing  <cit> ; the data have been assembled into two reference genomes, btau and umd  <cit> .

after the bovine reference genome was assembled, several bovine genomes were resequenced, providing more insight into the genetic diversity of cattle that may be associated with phenotypic differences between breeds. in  <dig>  van tassell et al. reported more than  <dig>  putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms  identified from a reduced representation dna library of  <dig> cattle representing three populations  <cit> . in  <dig>  eck et al. performed the first single cattle whole-genome resequencing and reported more than  <dig> million novel snps in a fleckvieh bull  <cit> . in  <dig>  kawahara-miki et al. resequenced the genome of a single kuchinoshima-ushi bull, a japanese native cattle breed whose lineage has been strictly maintained in a small island secluded from mainland japan  <cit> . in that study, more than  <dig>  million novel snps were reported, and the kuchinoshima-ushi bull was determined to be genetically distinct from european domestic cattle breeds. most recently, stothard and colleagues reported whole-genome resequencing of black angus and holstein, representative beef and dairy breeds, respectively, in north america, leading to the identification of substantial numbers of snps and copy number variants  that could potentially be used as genetic markers across the genome  <cit> .

when high-density genome-wide snp data are available, analyses can identify genetic differences between similar populations. understanding the genetic mechanisms leading to phenotypic differentiation requires identification of the genomic regions that have been under artificial selection in cattle breeds. for example, strong artificial selection will increase the frequency of favorable alleles at loci affecting meat quality traits in meat-producing breeds such as hanwoo or black angus. in this process, a small region of the genome surrounding the mutations is also selected, resulting in a small genome region that shows reduced variation. many methods have been developed for the detection of selection signatures from genome analyses, such as the use of regions of homozygosity   <cit> , the integrated haplotype score   <cit> , fst <cit> , and the extended haplotype homozygosity  statistic  <cit> , according to the detection of the timescale for selection signatures. rohs are without heterozygosity in the diploid states and provide association evidence at the genome-wide scale for complex traits.

hanwoo, a korean cattle breed, is reported to have originated from crossbreeding between taurine and zebu cattle and migrated to the korean peninsula through north china; their history as a draft animal dates back at least  <dig>  years  <cit> . afterward, hanwoo was maintained without the introduction of additional germplasm. hanwoo was raised as a draft animal until the 1970s. in the late 1970s, the korean government initiated a hanwoo genetic breeding program to improve meat quantity and quality.

in this study, we sequenced the genome of a hanwoo breeding bull and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  based on the bos taurus reference genome assembly . snps of hanwoo were compared with those of black angus and holstein. moreover, functional annotation was carried out for snps. we also investigated genomic regions of homozygosity in hanwoo, black angus, and holstein.

RESULTS
genome sequencing, snp/indel detection, and genotype concordance
whole-genome sequencing of a hanwoo bull was performed using the abi solid platform. approximately  <dig>  billion reads were produced from three independently prepared libraries. using bfast, ~ <dig>  billion reads of  <dig> gigabases  were aligned to btau <dig>  and filtered for redundant sequence reads. in total,  <dig> % of the reference genome sequence was covered with an average mapping depth of ~ <dig> -fold . this up-to-date hanwoo sequence coverage was the highest in the bovine genomes sequenced until now, which could facilitate more reliable snp identification  <cit> . sequencing data from black angus and holstein were reanalyzed with modified parameters to compare the sequencing data of hanwoo to black angus and holstein from a previous report  <cit> . the mapping depth of coverage in the black angus and holstein were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, slightly lower than that in a previous report  <cit> . this inconsistency may be due to a difference in the application programs and algorithms used for analysis. however, in spite of relatively low read depths of black angus and holstein bulls,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reference genome was covered by the sequenced reads at the minimum read depth of  <dig>  respectively , higher than the 93% coverage with  <dig> -fold mapping depth reported in kuchinoshima-ushi  <cit> .

in total,  <dig> , <dig> snps were identified in the hanwoo genome using the genome analysis tool kit   <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . among them,  <dig> , <dig> snps  were found in the single-nucleotide polymorphism database  while the remaining  <dig> , <dig> snps  were novel;  <dig> , <dig>  were heterozygous and  <dig> , <dig>  were homozygous, with a ratio of 1: <dig>   . using unifiedgenotyper in gatk, we identified  <dig>  small indels ;  <dig>   were heterozygous and  <dig>   were homozygous . of these indels,  <dig>  were found in dbsnp  while the remaining  <dig>  indels  were novel. all snps and indels identified in hanwoo were submitted to the dbsnp at ncbi under the handle nias_agbsgl.

to evaluate the snp calling from our high-throughput genome sequencing data, concordance analysis was performed between hanwoo genome resequencing and the snp chip data. the same genomic dna from hanwoo used for deep resequencing was genotyped for  <dig>  snps using bovinesnp <dig> beadchip . all probe sequences were mapped against the btau <dig>  reference genome assembly, and  <dig>  positions were identified as unique genomic loci. in total,  <dig>   of  <dig>  homozygous calls by the snp chip have been identified as heterozygous by ngs. in total,  <dig>  of  <dig>  heterozygous calls by the snp chip were identified as homozygous by ngs . the overall genotype concordance was  <dig> %. the non-reference sensitivity and non-reference discrepancy rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. non-reference sensitivity is the fraction of sites called variants  in comparison to those that are also called variants in evaluation data. the non-reference discrepancy rate, which is a good measure for testing the accuracy of genotype calls, can show the accuracy of genotype calling at sites called by both sites by excluding concordant genotypes .

functional annotation of genomic variation
the snps in genic regions were annotated using  <dig>  genes from the ncbi reference sequence database . in total,  <dig> , <dig> snps  identified in the hanwoo genome were located in genic regions:  <dig> , <dig> snps were located in introns,  <dig>  snps were located in untranslated regions , and  <dig> snps were located in splice sites. in total,  <dig>  coding snps including  <dig>  non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions such as missense and nonsense/read-through snps were also found . in total,  <dig>  indels  were in genic regions, of which  <dig>  indels were identified as variations that may change amino acid sequences such as frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site snps, which may have the potential to cause functional differences. non-synonymous snps, splice-site variants, and coding indels within a coding dna sequence , which may affect gene function, were detected in hanwoo , black angus , and holstein , respectively . the hanwoo genome contained more ns/ss/is than those of black angus and holstein. this suggests that hanwoo is a more genetically distant breed than black angus and holstein based on the reference genome of hereford, which is consistent with a previous report  <cit> . of all reference genes ,  <dig>  genes contained ns/ss/i genes and  <dig> genes revealed more than  <dig> ns/ss/is in all breeds . atp-binding cassette subfamily c member  <dig>  and zinc-finger protein 280b  genes showed more than  <dig> ns/ss/is. four isoforms  of the abcc <dig> gene are located on bta <dig> in tandem with each other . fifty-four variations  in four isoforms are recorded in ensembl. however, the znf280b gene is a single-copy gene  located on bta <dig> and  <dig> ns/ss/is exist in ensembl, although znf280b has a smaller genome span  and transcript  compared to the genome spans  and transcripts  of abcc <dig> gene copies. these findings show that these two genes surely belong to the gene group of more ns/ss/is rather than other common genes. a study has reported that the number of copies of the abcc <dig> gene increases and the gene is overexpressed in the process of selection for resistant mouse cells against antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin  <cit> . therefore, this suggests that genes containing several ns/ss/is may have evolved into multi-copy genes for environmental adaptation, or that ns/ss/is may be distorted due to an incorrect reference genome sequence. however, this is necessary for experimental validation based on phenomena such as cnv or segmental duplication. alternatively, the possibility of the presence of pseudogenes should not be excluded for genes containing several ns/ss/is. among  <dig>  genes containing ns/ss/is, the number of genes containing specific ns/ss/is was  <dig>  in hanwoo,  <dig>  in black angus, and  <dig> in holstein. in hanwoo,  <dig>  genes contained reliable specific ns/ss/is with more than tenfold depth. furthermore, of  <dig>  genes containing specific ns/ss/is,  <dig> genes were revealed in hanwoo only and  <dig> genes contained more than one novel damaging ns/ss/i in the functions among them . seven ns/ss/is and six novel damaging ns/ss/is were found in hanwoo specifically within the raftlin lipid raft linking protein  <dig>  gene, which is important in the formation or maintenance of membrane lipid rafts  <cit>  and is overexpressed in smooth muscles .

next, we investigated whether ns/ss/i-containing genes were associated with economic traits and then categorized them into meat, disease resistance, growth, milk, and fecundity. we used previously reported information on trait-associated genes  <cit> . in total,  <dig> genes were assigned as trait-associated genes:  <dig> genes for meat quality,  <dig> genes for disease resistance,  <dig> genes for milk production,  <dig> genes for fecundity, and  <dig> genes for growth rate . of the  <dig> genes for meat quality,  <dig> contained more than one ns/ss/i. the titin  gene has  <dig> ns/ss/is, the largest number among the genes related to meat quality. the bovine major histocompatibility complex  class i heavy chain isoform  <dig> precursor  gene, which contain  <dig> ns/ss/is, has the largest number of ns/ss/is among the genes related to disease resistance . the higher number of ns/ss/is in ttn than bola may be due to the difference of gene size;  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb of ttn and bola genes, respectively. the ttn gene encodes the titin protein, the largest protein, which consists of  <dig> exons in  <dig>  kb of genomic dna in bta <dig> . the ttn gene plays a role in myofibrillogenesis and is associated with marbling  <cit> . moreover, the 231054c>t variant within the promoter region of ttn is associated with a marbling trait and is differentially expressed between high- and low-marbling muscle samples  <cit> . however, many ns/ss/is likely affect the function of titin, which acts as a molecular spring for the passive elasticity of muscles  <cit> . these ns/ss/is within the ttn gene may be informative variants for understanding the effects of steric changes in the ttn protein. of the  <dig> genes for disease resistance,  <dig> also contained ns/ss/is, and many novel damaging ns/ss/is were detected in several genes including bcl2-like  <dig> , nitric oxide synthase  <dig> , nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein  <dig> , granzyme a , and semaphorin-5a , as well as the bola gene . among  <dig> genes containing more than one novel damaging specific ns/ss/is in hanwoo, the bcl2l <dig>  gzma, and cd <dig> genes are known as candidate genes for the disease resistance trait . we suggest that the exonic variation identified in this study will provide valuable information for functional studies as well as marker development associated with economic traits in cattle.

regions of homozygosity within the three breeds
a roh is a continuous or uninterrupted stretch of dna without heterozygosity in the diploid state. a discrepancy has existed in the minimum standard of definition of roh among the groups that have been studied for rohs to date  <cit> . most previous roh studies have been performed with snp chip results, an average of  <dig> snps of  <dig> mb in size with an average distance of  <dig> kb between them, and an allowance of up to 2% heterozygous snps within a roh  <cit> . however, at present, no standardized criteria have been established for defining rohs  <cit> . in this study, using mass genotype data derived from whole-genome resequencing, we shortened the detection window of rohs and loosened the permissible ratio of heterozygous snps .

our criteria were as follows: the roh detection window was  <dig> kb and 20% of heterozygous snps were allowed for hanwoo, black angus, and holstein . we defined  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rohs in hanwoo, black angus, and holstein, respectively . angus and holstein were bred for meat and milk production, respectively. in contrast, hanwoo was raised as a draft animal until the 1970s. since  <dig>  hanwoo has been bred as beef cattle according to the hanwoo genetic improvement national program organized by the government. here, we suggest that the total lengths of rohs in holstein and black angus are longer than those of hanwoo because holstein and black angus have been artificially selected for a longer period of time. overall, the dispersing pattern of rohs in chromosomes was variable and also differed in the overlapping pattern of rohs between breeds; we found two overlapping regions between hanwoo and black angus, three overlapping regions between hanwoo and holstein, and  <dig> overlapping regions between black angus and holstein . these patterns would result from different origins and breeding strategies among the three breeds because black angus and holstein originated in aberdeen, scotland and the netherlands, respectively, and have been bred as beef and dairy cattle, respectively, while hanwoo was bred independently as beef cattle in the korean peninsula since  <dig> 

 <dig> sroh: roh specific to a breed identified by comparing rohs among breeds. a single roh can produce more than one sroh when a middle portion of the roh is present in another breed such that the two outer regions of the roh are specific to a breed. alternatively, if an entire roh is present in more than one breed it is not counted as a sroh in any breed.

2ns/ss/i non-synonymous snp/splice-site variation/coding indel.

a total of  <dig> genes resided in the rohs of hanwoo, whereas  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes existed in the rohs of black angus and holstein, respectively. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> common genes were located within the overlapping rohs between hanwoo and angus and between hanwoo and holstein, respectively . among the  <dig> genes in the rohs of hanwoo,  <dig> genes contained no ns/ss/is. a total of  <dig>  genes  contained no ns/ss/is in the rohs in any of the three breeds . moreover, we performed functional enrichment analysis using gene ontology  for genes in the rohs of the three breeds . in hanwoo, one significant go term was ‘regulation of actin filament length related to muscle metabolism’ , including actin-related protein  <dig> homolog , actin-related protein 2/ <dig> complex, subunit  <dig> , villin  <dig> , and destrin  genes. meat tenderness is generated by the disruption of actin filaments and by breaking down the interaction between the actin and myosin filaments  <cit> . notably, a significant go term of ‘striated muscle cell differentiation’  was found in holstein, including the retinoid x receptor, alpha  gene, which inhibits adipogenesis  <cit>  and plays a negative role in marbling in hanwoo  <cit> . because hanwoo and black angus were bred as beef cattle,  <dig> genes in overlapping rohs between the breeds were used to analyze go and the kegg pathway. although eight significant go terms were detected, most were related to the immune system, such as t cell activation and lymphocyte activation, rather than meat traits. the presence of many immune system-related genes in the identified rohs could reflect selection  for disease resistance. according to functional enrichment analysis using kegg pathway terms, vitamin b <dig> metabolism  was significantly enriched, including the aldehyde oxidase  <dig>  gene in hanwoo . vitamin b <dig> induces the differentiation of adipocytes from pre-adipocytes and facilitates fat accumulation  <cit> . in particular, the aox <dig> gene is a target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma  as a key gene in adipogenesis  <cit> . melanogenesis  was also detected in holstein. sixteen genes, including tyrosinase  and the melanocortin  <dig> receptor , exist in this term. tyr is the rate-limiting enzyme in the melanogenesis pathway. tyrosinase activity is regulated by the mc1r. recently, kuhn and weikard reported the dilution of black pigment  in an f <dig> holstein × charolais population  <cit> . these genes may also be partially responsible for the coat color pattern of holsteins. these observations suggest that genes within the roh accumulate the biological functions for characteristics of each breed during a process of artificial selection.

we found trait-associated genes containing ns/ss/is in the rohs of each breed . twenty-five trait-associated genes for meat quality and disease resistance were found in the rohs of hanwoo. among these, nine were associated with meat quality traits and contained ns/ss/is: ttn, acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha , isocitrate dehydrogenase  <dig> , amylotrophic lateral sclerosis  <dig> , sp <dig> transcription factor , retinoic acid receptor gamma , collagen type ix alpha  <dig> , fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor . in humans, the homozygosity association approach has been applied to identify causal mutations for autosomal recessive disorders in consanguineous families  <cit> , as well as the genome-wide investigation of candidate genes for complex phenotypes such as schizophrenia  <cit> , late-onset alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , and height  <cit> . unlike humans, farm animals are artificially selected to improve genetic performance for economic traits such as meat quality and milk production. therefore, genes related to economically important traits are gradually fixed with a dominant allele as a result of artificial selection. in livestock, fixed genes should be considered major genes that control a certain trait for any breed because genes can become fixed, dominant alleles through artificial selection or evolution. however, we suggest that genes containing ns/ss/is in rohs are still strong candidate genes for meat quality traits in the hanwoo population because they may be in the selection process for breeding. according to previous reports, a splice-site mutation within the fabp <dig> gene in australian cattle is significantly associated with intramuscular fat content  <cit> ; snps within the fabp <dig> gene are associated with palmitoleic acid and linoleic acid content in intramuscular fat in japanese cattle  <cit>  and with backfat thickness  <cit> , marbling score, and carcass weight in hanwoo  <cit> . the idh <dig> gene, which is responsible for ketoglutarate, co <dig>  and nadph production from isocitrate in the cytosol and associated with body weight and fat deposition  <cit> , had one damaging ns/ss/i in hanwoo.

in addition, to detect common rohs between the genome sequence and snp chip, we calculated the rohs from  <dig> hanwoo bulls as well as  <dig> angus and  <dig> holstein individuals using the bovine 50k snp chip . we identified four, eight, and eight common rohs between both data sets in hanwoo, black angus, and holstein, respectively . in hanwoo,  <dig> genes located in common rohs were shared between genome sequencing and snp chips in bta <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . of  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes contained no ns/ss/i . moreover, four common rohs in hanwoo coincided with quantitative trait loci  for meat fat traits . specifically, two regions in bta <dig>  were common rohs between genome sequencing and snp chips in hanwoo and black angus. of the  <dig> genes that resided in these regions, wd repeat domain  <dig> , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <dig>  chromosome region, candidate  <dig> , cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily a, polypeptide  <dig> , and camp responsive element binding protein  <dig>  genes belonged to a significant go term of metabolic processes in hanwoo. among them, the creb <dig> gene has been shown to be related to fat metabolism. in  <dig>  lee et al. reported that the expression of the camp responsive element binding protein  gene is higher in muscle with high imf content in hanwoo  <cit> . creb <dig> is a transcription factor containing a basic leucine zipper. the creb protein is phosphorylated in response to increased camp, allowing it to efficiently interact with the transcriptional co-activator protein, creb binding protein, to stimulate the transcription of camp target genes  <cit> . moreover, casimir and ntambi reported that intracellular camp activates the expression of the stearoyl-coa desaturase gene, a key enzyme involved in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis through activation of the creb protein  <cit> . in  <dig>  wang et al. observed that messenger rna expression of a lipogenesis-related gene, stearoyl-coa desaturase , peaked at  <dig> to  <dig> months in crosses between wagyu and hereford, which was highly correlated with intramuscular fat content in these animals  <cit> . these findings suggest that elevated creb expression may stimulate genes involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathway such as scd  <cit>  and hmg-co synthase  <cit> , resulting in an increase in imf content within muscles. also, the als <dig> gene, which is related to meat traits, as well as cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein  <dig>  and cd <dig> molecule  genes for disease resistance, resided in a common roh  in hanwoo and black angus according to genome sequencing . in livestock animals bred by an improvement scheme for economic traits, the use of rohs will be a good genomic strategy for tracking and planning improvements in breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sequenced the whole genome of a hanwoo bull and newly identified  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  small indels by comparison with the hereford reference genome sequence. we also found  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels that were located in genic regions of  <dig>  genes in the ncbi reference sequence database , of which  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels were non-synonymous, frameshift, nonsense, or splice-site snps potentially capable of affecting protein functions. this suggests that genes containing several ns/ss/is may have evolved into multi-copy genes for environmental adaptation, or that ns/ss/is may be distorted due to an incorrect reference genome sequence. a roh is a continuous or uninterrupted stretch of dna without heterozygosity in the diploid state. in this study, we defined  <dig> rohs in hanwoo using a detection window of  <dig> kb and 20% of heterozygous snps using genotype data derived from whole-genome resequencing. the cumulative lengths of rohs per genome, as well as the number of rohs in hanwoo, were smaller than those in black angus and holstein. this suggests that the total lengths of rohs in holstein and black angus are longer than those of hanwoo due to a longer period of time for artificial selection in those breeds. in addition, the dispersing pattern of rohs in chromosomes was different between breeds. we suggest that these patterns would result from the different origins and breeding strategies among these three breeds. moreover,  <dig> genes were observed in the rohs of hanwoo, of which  <dig> genes were associated with meat quality and disease resistance traits. in addition, we observed common rohs between the genome sequence and high-density snp chip data. this combinatorial roh survey approach may be another effective method for identifying domestication genes. the findings of this study will provide valuable information for functional studies, as well as for marker development associated with economically important traits in cattle.
