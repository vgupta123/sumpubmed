BACKGROUND
alzheimer’s disease  is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta  plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in various brain regions . the 37– <dig> amino acid aβ fragments in the brain are originally derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein  via proteolytic processing by β- and γ-secretase  <cit> . aβ1– <dig> and aβ1– <dig> are two major neurotoxic aβ fragments, which were mainly generated in the amyloidogenic processing pathway by the actin of β- and γ-secretase  <cit> . aβ25– <dig> is not naturally generated in the brain, instead it represents the neurotoxic fragment of aβ1– <dig> or aβ1– <dig>  and therefore is often used to mimic the neurotoxic role of aβ1– <dig> or aβ1– <dig> in experimental studies  <cit> . despite increasing evidence showing that aβ could cause morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, dna fragmentation, caspase activation and subsequent activation of apoptotic signaling pathways , the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurotoxic effect of aβ have not been fully elucidated. therefore, identification of key players and mechanisms of aβ-induced neurotoxicity would benefit the development of novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating ad.

tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein  <dig>  was originally identified as a gene whose expression can be induced by the tumor necrosis factor alpha  in umbilical vein endothelial cells  <cit> . tnfaip <dig> gene is found to be an evolutionarily extremely conserved single-copy gene  <cit> , implying that tnfaip <dig> has an important physiological role, which is yet to be explored. tnfaip <dig> has been demonstrated to interact directly with proliferating cell nuclear antigen  and the small subunit  of dna polymerase δ, implying that it may be involved in dna synthesis or dna repair  <cit> . kim et al.  <cit>  found that rhob induces apoptosis by interacting with tnfaip <dig> via a jnk-mediated signaling mechanism, suggesting that tnfaip <dig> is an apoptosis-related protein. in addition, the transcription levels of tnfaip <dig> had been found to be robustly induced in the transgenic c. elegans ad brains and post-mortem ad brain  <cit> , suggesting tnfaip <dig> may also involve in the process of ad development. moreover, a recent study implied that estrogen may affect hippocampal-related diseases by regulating tnfaip <dig>  <cit> . however, the role of tnfaip <dig> in ad has not been demonstrated.

in the present study, we examined the roles of tnfaip <dig> in aβ25–35-induced apoptosis in neuronal cell line by testing whether the neuronal apoptosis induced by aβ25– <dig> is associated with the expression of tnfaip <dig> protein, and if so, whether apoptosis can be blocked by inhibition of tnfaip <dig> expression using tnfaip <dig> sirna. in addition, to further clarify the signal transduction pathways involved in the neurotoxicity induced by aβ, we also examined the potential signal transduction pathways involved in the apoptosis induced by tnfaip <dig> 

our findings demonstrated that tnfaip <dig> can be induced by aβ25– <dig>  overexpression of tnfaip <dig> promotes aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity, whereas knock-down of tnfaip <dig> blocks aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity. in addition, our results suggested that tnfaip <dig> induced by aβ25– <dig> can further inactivate the akt/creb signaling pathway, which in turn downregulates bcl- <dig> expression.

RESULTS
aβ25– <dig> induces tnfaip <dig> expression
to determine whether aβ25– <dig> can increase the tnfaip <dig> protein expression, mouse primary cortical neurons were treated with aβ25– <dig> at different doses for 24 h, and western blot was used to examine tnfiap <dig> protein level. as shown in fig. 1a, tnfaip <dig> expression was increased by aβ25– <dig> in a dose-dependent manner, and  <dig>   <dig> and 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> significantly upregulated tnfaip <dig> protein levels . similar results were obtained in n2a cells , as tnfaip <dig> protein expression in n2a was also significantly increased by aβ25– <dig> in a dose-dependent manner . furthermore, the endogenous tnfaip <dig> mrna levels in n2a cells were detected by real-time pcr. as expected, aβ25– <dig> treatment resulted in a significant increase in tnfaip <dig> mrna levels, and treatment with 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> for 16 h led to the highest expression of tnfaip <dig> mrna, but prolonged 24 h treatment did not further increase the tnfaip <dig> mrna levels .fig.  <dig> effect of aβ25– <dig> on tnfaip <dig> expression. a tnfaip <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in mouse primary cortical neurons cultured in  <dig> wells plate and treated with dose-dependent aβ25– <dig> . b quantitative analysis of tnfaip <dig> protein levels  in mouse primary cortical neurons. data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with aβ25– <dig>  . c tnfaip <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and treated with dose-dependent aβ25– <dig> . d quantitative analysis of tnfaip <dig> protein levels  in n2a cells. data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with aβ25– <dig>  . e tnfaip <dig> mrna levels were determined by rt-pcr in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and treated with 20 μm of aβ25– <dig>  data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with aβ25– <dig> 



tnfaip <dig> contributes to aβ25–35-induced cell toxicity in n2a cells
to further investigate whether tnfaip <dig> is involved in aβ25–35-induced cell death, n2a cells were transiently transfected with control sirna or tnfaip <dig> sirna for 24 h, and then treated with indicated dose of aβ25– <dig> for another 24 h. western blot showed that the endogenous tnfaip <dig> protein expression was significantly suppressed by specific tnfaip <dig> sirna but not control sirna . mtt assay indicated that the cell viability in control sirna transfected-n2a cells was significantly decreased when exposed to  <dig> or 20 μm of aβ25– <dig>  however, inhibition of tnfaip <dig> by tnfaip <dig> sirna significantly rescued the viability of n2a cells under 20 μm aβ25– <dig> . furthermore, to investigate whether tnfaip <dig> is associated with increased susceptibility to aβ25– <dig>  the effect of tnfaip <dig> overexpression on aβ25–35-reduced the cell viability was also investigated. transfection of myc-tnfaip <dig> into n2a cells led to significant overexpression of tnfaip <dig> protein , and aβ25–35-induced cell death was further significantly exacerbated by tnfaip <dig> overexpression . taken together, these results indicate that tnfaip <dig> contributes to aβ25–35-induced cell toxicity of n2a cells.fig.  <dig> effect of tnfaip <dig> on aβ25–35-induced neuronal cell death. a tnfaip <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with 20 pmol of control sirna or tnfaip <dig> sirna. b mtt reduction was measured by mtt assay in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with 20 pmol of control sirna or tnfaip <dig> sirna, followed by treated by dose-dependent aβ25– <dig> . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with aβ25– <dig> , #p <  <dig>  compared with control sirna plus aβ25– <dig> . c myc-tnfaip <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with  <dig>  μg of pcmv-myc or myc-tnfaip <dig>  d mtt reduction was measured by mtt assay in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with dose-dependent myc-tnfaip <dig> , followed by treated by pbs or aβ25– <dig> . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with myc-tnfaip <dig>  plus pbs. #p <  <dig>  compared with myc-tnfaip <dig> plus pbs



tnfaip <dig> contributes to aβ25–35-induced apoptosis
previous study suggested that tnfaip <dig> is an apoptosis-related protein  <cit> , implying that tnfaip <dig> may also involve in aβ25–35-induced apoptosis. cleaved caspase- <dig> is a pivotal executioner and hallmark of apoptosis that is usually activated in the apoptotic cell by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. to further determine whether involvement of tnfaip <dig> in aβ25–35-induced neuronal apoptosis is associated with changes in the activities of caspases, cleaved caspase- <dig> was detected by western blot. as shown in fig. 3a, b, n2a cells treated with 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> led to a significant increase in the level of cleaved caspase- <dig>  while aβ25–35-induced caspase- <dig> cleavage was significantly repressed by the knockdown of tnfaip <dig>  in contrast, 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> treatment or myc-tnfaip <dig> transfection or aβ25–35+myc-tnfaip <dig> co-treatment exhibited a significant increase in the cleavage of caspase- <dig> . these results indicate that tnfaip <dig> contributes to aβ25–35-induced apoptosis.fig.  <dig> effect of tnfaip <dig> on aβ25–35-induced the cleavage of caspase- <dig>  a cleaved caspase- <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with 50 pmol of control sirna or tnfaip <dig> sirna, followed by treated by aβ25– <dig> . b quantitative analysis of cleaved caspase- <dig> protein levels  in n2a cells. data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with control sirna, #p <  <dig>  compared with control sirna plus aβ25– <dig> . c cleaved caspase- <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with 4 μg of pcmv-myc or myc-tnfaip <dig>  followed by treated by aβ25– <dig> . d quantitative analysis of cleaved caspase- <dig> protein levels  in n2a cells. data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared with pcmv-myc



tnfaip <dig> inhibits akt/creb signaling pathway
it has been reported that akt/creb signaling plays neuroprotective roles  <cit>  and aβ could downregulate akt survival pathway  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies, our results showed that aβ25– <dig> causes a decrease in akt phosphorylation , creb phosphorylation  and bcl- <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner . to further explore whether involvement of tnfaip <dig> in neuronal apoptosis was associated with changes in akt/creb signaling pathway, we overexpressed tnfaip <dig> in n2a cells in dose-dependent manner and then assessed akt phosphorylation and creb phosphorylation . as expected, overexpression of tnfaip <dig> in n2a cells led to significant attenuation of p-akt and p-creb in a dose-dependent manner . importantly, we also observed that overexpression of tnfaip <dig> could significantly reduce the protein levels of bcl- <dig> , which is an important neuroprotectant and transactivated by creb in response to aβ stimulation  <cit> . therefore, these results indicate that tnfaip <dig> may mediate aβ25–35-induced apoptotic signaling by attenuating p-akt, p-creb and bcl- <dig> expression.fig.  <dig> effect of aβ25– <dig> and tnfaip <dig> on p-akt, p-creb and bcl- <dig> expression. a p-akt, p-creb and bcl- <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and treated with dose-dependent aβ25– <dig> . b p-akt, p-creb and bcl- <dig> protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with myc-tnfaip <dig> and pcmv-myc . c quantitative analysis of p-creb protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared with myc-tnfaip <dig> . d quantitative analysis of p-akt protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with myc-tnfaip <dig> . e quantitative analysis of bcl- <dig> protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with myc-tnfaip <dig> 



tnfaip <dig> knockdown recovers aβ25–35-induced creb dephosphrylation and bcl- <dig> downregulation
aβ had been reported to dramatically decrease creb phosphorylation and bcl- <dig> expression  <cit> . to investigate the roles of tnfaip <dig> in aβ25–35-reduced creb phosphrylation and bcl- <dig> expression, control sirna or tnfaip <dig> sirna was transfected into n2a cells for 24 h, followed by treatment with 20 μm of aβ25– <dig>  consistent with previous studies  <cit> , aβ25– <dig> treatment significantly reduced creb phosphrylation and bcl- <dig> expression. tnfaip <dig> sirna but not control sirna significantly upregulated creb phosphorylation. however, tnfaip <dig> sirna could partially attenuate the inhibitory effect of aβ25– <dig> on p-creb and bcl- <dig> . these results indicated that inhibition of tnfaip <dig> could attenuate aβ-induced neurotoxicity partially by recovering the inhibitory effect of aβ on p-creb and bcl- <dig> expression.fig.  <dig> effect of tnfaip <dig> knockdown on aβ25–35-decreased bcl- <dig> and p-creb. a bcl- <dig> and p-creb protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with 50 pmol of control sirna or tnfaip <dig> sirna, followed by treated by aβ25– <dig> . b quantitative analysis of p-creb protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared with control sirna, #p <  <dig>  compared with control sirna plus aβ25- <dig> . . quantitative analysis of bcl- <dig> protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  compared with control sirna



tnfaip <dig> contributes to aβ25–35-induced creb dephosphrylation and bcl- <dig> downregulation
the effect of tnfaip <dig> overexpression on creb phosphrylation and bcl- <dig> expression under resting and aβ25– <dig> treatment condition were also determined. our results showed that 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> or aβ25–35+myc-tnfaip <dig> had exhibited almost equivalent inhibitory effect on the p-creb . moreover, we also observed that 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> treatment, myc-tnfaip <dig> transfection, and aβ25–35+myc-tnfaip <dig> co-treatment result in significant decrease in the expression of bcl- <dig> . these results implied that tnfaip <dig> maybe a key mediator involved in aβ-induced neurotoxicity by inhibition of p-creb and bcl- <dig> expression.fig.  <dig> effect of tnfaip <dig> overexpression on aβ25–35-decreased bcl- <dig> and p-creb. a bcl- <dig> and p-creb protein levels were measured by western blot in n2a cells cultured in  <dig> wells plate and transfected with 4 μg of pcmv-myc or myc-tnfaip <dig>  followed by treated by aβ25– <dig> . b quantitative analysis of p-creb protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared with pcmv-myc. c quantitative analysis of bcl- <dig> protein levels . data are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared with pcmv-myc



discussion
deposition of aβ in the brain is a pathological hallmark of ad as it is responsible for progressive neurodegeneration in ad  <cit> . accumulating evidences indicated that aβ could cause neurotoxicity by inducing neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis will help us on developing treatment of ad. however, despite intense research, it remains unclear how aβ triggers the signaling cascade that results in neuronal dysfunction and neurotoxicity. in the present study, our results demonstrated that tnfaip <dig> protein is induced by aβ25– <dig> and involved in aβ25–35-induced neuronal apoptotic pathway because overexpression of tnfaip <dig> can accelerate aβ25–35-induced apoptosis while inhibition of tnfaip <dig> can significantly reduce aβ25–35-induced neuronal apoptosis. moreover, we found that tnfaip <dig> was involved in aβ25–35-induced neuronal apoptosis by deactivating akt signaling pathway and creb transcriptional activity.

the transcript levels of tnfaip <dig> was found to be robustly induced in the transgenic c. elegans ad brains and post-mortem ad brain in previous study  <cit> , which led us to examine the hypothesis that tnfaip <dig> was involved in the pathological development of ad using an in vitro mouse ad model: mouse primary cortical neurons and n2a neuroblastoma cells treated by aβ25– <dig>  our results suggested that aβ25– <dig> could induce tnfaip <dig> protein and mrna levels in a dose-dependent manner. furthermore, overexpression or knockdown of tnfaip <dig> exacerbated or alleviated aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity. together, these results indicated that the tnfaip <dig> gene expression may be critical for aβ25–35-induced neuronal death and intervention of its expression could be a potential method for inhibiting aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity. however, the regulatory mechanisms of tnfaip <dig> remain largely unclear. only a recent report described that transcription factor sp <dig> could bind to human tnfaip <dig> promoter region and transactivate tnfaip <dig> promoter  <cit> . as tnfaip <dig> had been originally found to be induced by tnfα  <cit> , which is a potent activator of nfκb, thus it is possible that tnfaip <dig> was also regulated by nfκb when exposed to aβ25– <dig>  further studies will be performed to elucidate whether inhibition of nfκb activation can reduce aβ25–35-induced tnfaip <dig> gene expression.

previous studies described that tnfaip <dig> was a pro-apoptotic protein  <cit> , and apoptosis is a general neuronal death pathway in neurodegenerative diseases which could be triggered by exposure to aβ. in the present study, we extended our observations to in vitro ad models that tnfaip <dig> was also involved in aβ25–35-induced apoptosis. we found that inhibition of tnfaip <dig> gene by specific sirna significantly attenuated aβ25– <dig> induced cleaved-caspase  <dig>  as caspase- <dig> cleavage is a central event in executing aβ25–35-induced neuronal apoptosis  <cit> , these results provide further evidence that tnfaip <dig> was involved in aβ25–35-induced apoptosis. however, it is worth noting that aβ25–35+myc-tnfaip <dig> co-treatment did not cause a much higher increase in the cleavage of caspase- <dig> than aβ25– <dig> treatment or myc-tnfaip <dig> transfection alone. it is possible that 20 μm of aβ25– <dig> treatment or myc-tnfaip <dig> transfection alone had already exerted a relatively strong apoptotic effect on n2a cells, which led to a insignificant effect on caspase  <dig> cleavage by additional other stimuli. this issue will be further defined in future studies. thus, these results are in support of the hypothesis that the induction of tnfaip <dig> expression is part of the intrinsic program of apoptotic neuronal death induced by accumulation of aβ in ad.

it had been demonstrated that creb is directly phosphorylated and regulated by the protein kinase akt  <cit> , and akt/creb signal has been shown to play a pivotal role in neuroprotection by enhancing cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis  <cit> . importantly, akt and creb could promote neuronal cell survival by upregulating bcl- <dig> protein levels  <cit> . as expected, tnfaip <dig> could reduce p-akt, p-creb and bcl- <dig> protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. moreover, we observed overexpression of tnfaip <dig> could further attenuate aβ-inhibited p-creb and bcl- <dig> protein expression, whereas inhibition of tnfaip <dig> could significantly reverse the effect of aβ on p-creb and bcl- <dig>  these results suggest that tnfaip <dig> may mediate the deactivation of creb induced by aβ, and then trigger neuronal apoptosis. mapks had been reported to be involved in aβ-induced apoptosis, and mapks signaling cascades were activated in brains from ad patients  <cit> . moreover, aβ-induced mapks include erk1/ <dig>  jnk and p <dig> mapk had been demonstrated to be associated with neuronal cell death  <cit> . therefore, tnfaip <dig> may also modulate mapks signaling cascades involved in aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis. further study will be conducted to elucidate the role of tnfaip <dig> in modulating mapks signaling pathway involved in the apoptotic effect of aβ.

in summary, in this study we found that tnfaip <dig> expression was elevated in mouse primary cortical neurons and n2a cells exposed to aβ25– <dig>  tnfaip <dig> overexpression was correlated with neuronal apoptosis initiated by aβ25– <dig> and inhibition of tnfaip <dig> was able to reduce the neuronal damage induced by aβ25– <dig> in vitro ad models. moreover, our results suggested that tnfaip <dig> may mediate aβ25–35-induced neuronal damage by inhibiting p-creb and bcl- <dig> protein levels. our results implied that inhibition of tnfaip <dig> gene during ad process could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of ad. further studies will be performed to determine the roles of tnfaip <dig> in in vivo ad models.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study clearly demonstrated that tnfaip <dig> was significantly upregulated by aβ25– <dig> in mouse primary cortical neurons and n2a cells, and tnfaip <dig> may be a key player that mediated aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity by inactivating the akt/creb signaling pathway, and in turn downregulating anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  our findings implied that tnfaip <dig> may be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of ad, but the roles and mechanism of tnfaip <dig> in in vivo ad models need to be further elucidated in our future study.
