BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains  are the causative agents of tuberculosis , a disease that has a considerable detrimental impact on human and animal health worldwide  <cit> . this group of slow growing pathogens includes the classical m. tuberculosis, m. bovis, m. africanum, m. microti, as well as the newly recognized mtbc members, m. pinnipedii and m. caprae species. m. tuberculosis remains one of the most successful and adaptable pathogens known to mankind despite the availability of a vaccine and effective antimicrobial agents. this adaptability certainly reflects a very ancient and prolific evolutionary history.

with the availability of complete mycobacterial genome sequences, whole-genome comparative sequence analyses were possible and resulted in the identification of sequence polymorphisms, that greatly inform our understanding of the evolutionary process of the mtbc  <cit> . it is now assumed that m. tuberculosis  and m. bovis  both arose from a common ancestor  <cit> . it has also become apparent that the m. africanum-m. microti lineage represents a phylogenetic bridge between m. tuberculosis and m. bovis, whereas "m. canettii", a rare phenotypically unusual tubercle bacillus, appears to be closest to the common progenitor of the mtbc  <cit> . recent studies confirmed that "m. canettii" and other smooth tubercle bacilli are representatives of pre-bottleneck lineages and that the progenitor species , from which the mtbc emerged, might have coexisted with early hominids  <cit> .

completion of the genome sequence of m. tuberculosis strain h37rv  <cit> , revealed that a major source of genetic variation in this species could be associated with two large gene families encoding acidic, asparagine- or glycine-rich proteins referred to as pe  and ppe . these multigene families represent approximately 10% of the coding capacity of the genome and are characterized by their high gc content and extensive repetitive structure. both families have been divided into subgroups, of which the pe_pgrs subfamily  of the pe family is particularly polymorphic and found to be enriched in essential genes  <cit> . although the function of the members of this gene subfamily is currently unknown, the pe_pgrs genes are strongly suspected to be associated with antigenic and genetic variability as well as virulence  <cit> . it is thought that members of the pe/ppe multigene families might frequently undergo genetic remodelling by gene duplication, recombination, and/or strand slippage mechanisms because of the presence of a large number of repeat sequences within these genes  <cit> . in the current study, we focused on a prominent polymorphism motif that occurs within two adjacent pe_pgrs genes, and provide evidence for its association with both early and recent evolutionary events leading to a new pe_pgrs-based perspective to dissect the evolution of tubercle bacilli.

RESULTS
comparative sequence analysis of contiguous pe genes
since the large number of homologous m. tuberculosis pe genes seem to have arisen by multiple gene duplication events, it is very difficult to determine duplication history. we thus focussed our comparative sequence analysis on pe genes that are situated adjacent to each other in the m. tuberculosis h37rv genome, as these tandem duplications , could signify real duplicates. fourteen neighbouring pe genes  were identified throughout the h37rv genome. about half of the contiguous pe sequences display more than 30% overall amino acid sequence similarity with their neighbouring pe gene member . as expected, a higher degree of similarity was associated with the conserved n-terminal pe region of the gene , as previously reported  <cit> . genes with low amino acid similarity were excluded from further analyses due to an uncertainty concerning their origin.

further scrutiny of the nucleotide and amino acid alignments, showed that the pe_pgrs <dig>  and pe_pgrs <dig>  genes  shared the highest identity, indicating that they may represent a true duplication event. within these two genes, we could identify  <dig> major alignable coding regions of  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acids, with a similarity of 98% and 90%, respectively . these genes thus fulfilled the criteria used previously to define the bacterial paranome  <cit>  and should be regarded as a typical tandem duplicate in spite of being separated by two overlapping, non-associated, non-pe genes . the first alignable coding region starts at the first codon and extends beyond the pe region, while the second maps to the highly repetitive and gc rich  pgrs c-terminal extension. pe_pgrs <dig> is larger than pe_pgrs <dig> essentially because of the presence of two extra in-frame nucleotide stretches, the first  is located between the two major alignable coding regions and, the second  represents an extra c-terminal extension . further inspection of the upstream non coding region of both genes revealed a nearly perfect homology starting at the nucleotide position - <dig>  furthermore, a blastn search performed against the whole genome of m. tuberculosis h37rv identified another pe_pgrs gene, pe_pgrs <dig> , sharing 98% identity through nucleotides - <dig> to  <dig> with pe_pgrs <dig> and 98% identity through - <dig> to  <dig> with pe_pgrs <dig>  pe_pgrs <dig>  which is located approximately  <dig>  mb distal in the genome, is thus clearly a paralog of pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig>  and is either the progenitor of these two genes or was duplicated from one of them. in a recent study, the  <dig> pe_pgrs orthologs were shown to share  <dig> nts at polymorphic positions lying upstream of their coding sequences  <cit> , thus confirming their evolutionary link. sequence analyses of the genome sequence of the phylogenetically closest non-tuberculous mycobacterial species, m. marinum, showed that its genome was devoid of both the pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> orthologs , as well as lacking the orthologue for pe_pgrs <dig> . as these genes were also found to be absent from other species of mycobacteria , the duplication of these three pe_pgrs genes thus seems to have taken place only after the divergence of the tubercle bacilli.

identification of a prominent genetic variation in pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> coding sequences
alignment of pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> with their corresponding published sequences  revealed a prominent genetic variation associated with the major alignable coding region  <dig> that was either restricted to pe_pgrs <dig>  or shared by both pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> genes  . in comparison to the genome of the m. tuberculosis reference strain h37rv, this genetic variation  consisted of a 12-nucleotide in-frame insertion accompanied by  <dig> snps dispersed along a dna stretch of  <dig> nucleotides , encompassing the junction between the pe and pgrs regions of the gene sequence . this variation results in a 4-amino acid insertion and  <dig> amino acid changes. in contrast, although pe_pgrs <dig> shared the mar <dig> region  with pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig>  no polymorphism occurred in the orthologs of this gene in the abovementioned sequenced strains .

distribution of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism throughout a worldwide collection of tubercle bacilli
based on the above observations, we decided to extend our analysis to an additional group of  <dig> genetically diverse and worldwide distributed tubercle bacilli. this group consisted of m. tuberculosis h37ra,  <dig> other m. tuberculosis strains sensu stricto,  <dig> m. bovis strains,  <dig> m. bovis bacille calmette-guérin  strain ,  <dig> m. africanum strains,  <dig> m. microti strains,  <dig> dassie bacillus,  <dig> m. caprae strain,  <dig> m. pinnipedii strain,  <dig> "m. canettii" strains, and  <dig> smooth tubercle bacilli strains . for this purpose, the dna sequence encompassing nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  for both pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_grs <dig> was determined in all these tubercle bacilli strains. the multiple sequence alignment  showed the absence, in both genes, of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in m. tuberculosis h37ra, the two "m. canettii" strains and in one smooth tubercle bacillus isolate. for the second smooth tubercle bacillus isolate, we have been able to amplify only pe_pgrs <dig> which was found to be devoid of such a polymorphism. strikingly, all strains of the m. africanum-m. microti-m. caprae-m. pinnipedii-m. bovis lineage , as well as the ancestral  and pgg <dig> strains of m. tuberculosis, harbor the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in only their pe_pgrs <dig> gene sequence and not in pe_pgrs <dig>  this finding was supported by analysis of the sequenced whole genome of m. microti strain ov <dig> . in contrast, the pool of m. tuberculosis bacilli belonging to pgg <dig> and pgg <dig> appears as a mix of  <dig> subpopulations; one showing the variation uniquely in pe_pgrs <dig>  while the second displays the genetic change in both paralogs. interestingly, similar to the pgg <dig> epidemic m. tuberculosis reference strain cdc <dig>  a pgg <dig> outbreak-associated tunisian m. tuberculosis haarlem <dig> strain  <cit>  displayed the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in both pe_pgrs paralogs.

development of a reverse hybridization-based assay for the detection of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism and confirmation of its non-random distribution throughout the evolutionary history of the mtbc
in order to be able to rapidly test for the presence or absence of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism, we devised a simple reverse-hybridization-based assay, named the pegassay . this consists of two biotinylated pcr products, encompassing the 12/ <dig> polymophism, each specific to the pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> sequences from each sample. the labeled amplicons were allowed to react independently with a 5' aminated 24-mer oligonucleotide probe, representing the  <dig> nt insertion and the  <dig> downstream nucleotides of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism. using this assay, we determined the distribution pattern of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism within additional tubercle bacilli strains, known to have a critical position in the evolutionary history of this group of pathogens , and in a larger collection of strains representing the  <dig> pgg groups recovered from africa, europe, north- and south-america. as shown in figure  <dig>  no hybridization occurred with either m. tuberculosis h37rv or its avirulent derived strain h37ra, while two hybridization spots are apparent for those strains harboring the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in both pe_pgrs paralogs. as expected, only one reacting dot corresponding to the pe_pgrs <dig> amplicon could be seen for strains where the 12/ <dig> polymorphism is restricted to this pe_pgrs gene. compilation of the sequence data with those of the reverse hybridization assay  revealed that  all "m. canettii" strains  and one smooth tubercle bacillus isolate are devoid of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in both pe_pgrs paralogs,  all strains of the m. africanum-m. microti-m. bovis and their related subspecies  harbor the polymorphism motif exclusively in their pe_pgrs <dig> gene sequence ,  all pgg <dig>  m. tuberculosis strains  associate with the m. africanum-m. microti-m. bovis in that they harbor the polymorphism motif exclusively in their pe_pgrs <dig> gene sequence,  for the remaining modern m. tuberculosis strains , the largest number of strains harbor the polymorphism exclusively in their pe_pgrs <dig> gene sequence, while a smaller proportion of pgg <dig> group  and only  <dig> strains from the pgg <dig> group contained the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in both pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> genes . a very small number of isolates  were found to mirror the reference strain m. tuberculosis h37rv and its derivative h37ra in that the 12/ <dig> polymorphism motif was absent from both pe_pgrs genes . this finding was confirmed by sequencing .

overall, depending on the occurrence pattern of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism , the whole mtbc complex falls into three pe_pgrs-based genotypic groups or pgrs types . aside from representing all strains  of the m. africanum-m. microti-m. bovis lineage and the m. tuberculosis pgg <dig> group, pgrst <dig>  is also significantly the most predominant pgrs type within the pgg <dig>  and pgg <dig>  groups. in contrast, pgrst <dig>  and pgrst <dig>  are restricted to modern, non pgg <dig>  m. tuberculosis strains. the pgrst <dig> subpopulation is very rare, as in the whole mtbc collection we could only identify  <dig> strains , which includes the laboratory strains h37rv and h37ra. importantly, pgrst <dig> was highly associated with pgg <dig> strains  and could also be significantly found in the pgg <dig> pool , albeit at a very low frequency .

frequency of the  <dig> new pe_pgrs-based genotypic groups  in three geographically distinct populations
as our collection contained a substantial number of strains originating from south africa , tunisia , and the usa , we analysed the frequency of pgrst <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> types in these three geographically and socio-economically distinct countries. as shown in figure , pgrst <dig> was predominant in the three geographic situations .

genetic variation of the pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> genes
to obtain better insight into the evolution of these two pe_pgrs paralogs, we analyzed the genetic variability of the sequenced genes across the worldwide tubercle bacilli collection. as mentioned earlier, the 12/ <dig> polymorphism is highly conserved, as the same insertion and the  <dig> accompanying snps are observed for both genes irrespective of the mtbc subspecies. in no case, have we noticed a missing snp or a variation for the 12-nt insertion and its associated  <dig> snps. however, aside from the 12/ <dig> polymorphism, we observed along the partial sequence of both genes, a total of  <dig> mtbc-associated polymorphic sites  . overall, after concatenating the sequences of both pe_pgrs genes and taking into account the 12/ <dig> polymorphism,  <dig> mtbc alleles were identified , of which  <dig>  were associated with m. tuberculosis. in this species, much of the genetic diversity was found to be associated with pe_pgrs <dig>  as assessed by the estimation of the π value for both synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitutions. however, both genes appear to be under purifying selection as their ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site  is < <dig> . unlike m. tuberculosis, the orthologs from strains of the m. africanum-m. microti-m. bovis lineage appear more homogeneous; the strain collections of m. africanum and m. microti each defining a unique allele, and sequences for  <dig> out of the  <dig> m. bovis strains  were identical.

the sequences from the pre-bottleneck species, "m. canettii" and other smooth tubercle bacilli, were clearly the most divergent. indeed, aside from sharing  <dig> snps with the other mtbc strains, they showed  <dig> additional specific polymorphic sites , clearly indicating their evolutionary distance from the rest of the mtbc. in both "m. canettii" and the two other smooth tubercle bacilli strains, pe_pgrs <dig> is frame-shifted  and this gene appears to be much more variable than its paralog.

further inspection of the nucleotide substitutions revealed that nucleotide changes in both paralogs tend to occur within the same nucleotide positions, irrespective of the evolutionary status of the species. in fact, nucleotide positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  showed variability in both pe_pgrs genes. thus, certain positions appear to be prone to genetic variation although evolving differently within different species. strikingly, in all but one variable position , the mutations in one paralog are permuted comparatively to the other. consequently, where the mutation is non synonymous  the phenotypic change for both paralogs is limited to two amino acids throughout all the species .

because pe_pgrs genes are gc-rich sequences, we looked at the occurrence of the mutation with respect to the codon position. anova and tukey's tests  showed that, for both genes, the third codon position significantly displayed the highest gc content . however, although mutations occurred more frequently at the third codon position  in pe_pgrs <dig>  no such association could be observed for pe_pgrs <dig>  thus, a mutational bias might have operated for the diversification of pe_pgrs <dig> 

discussion
previous studies involving comparative genomics and explorative genome-wide multilocus analysis conclusively showed that the present mtbc strains appear as a genetically homogeneous clonal pool, since they display a highly significant linkage disequilibrium and an exceptionally low rate of silent nucleotide substitutions  <cit> . this picture contrasts with the situation that seems to have prevailed in the very early history of the tubercle bacillus in which a significant rate of dna exchanges were allowed, most likely through intragenomic recombination and horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . compelling evidence suggest that members of the mtbc arose from a single successful ancestor, resulting from a recent evolutionary bottleneck  <cit> . the identity of such a parental strain has not been defined, though some genetic markers  help to distinguish between ancestral and modern mtbc strains  <cit> .

the findings from this study provide additional evidence for the concept that the present clonal mtbc strains are the progeny of a single successful ancestor. indeed, the identified pe_pgrs-associated 12/ <dig> polymorphism could represent a genetic marker for the most successful post-bottleneck-derived clone from which the mtbc strains expanded. based on this polymorphism, we showed that all mtbc strains could be assigned to three new pe_pgrs-based genotypic groups . strikingly, pgrst <dig> was found to be predominant in all three katg-gyra defined pgg groups irrespective of their geographic origin and evolutionary status . because all ancestral  strains, including the m. africanum-m. microti-m. bovis lineage, belong to pgrst <dig>  one can argue that acquisition of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism is coincident with the emergence of the most successful mtbc parental strain. consistently, the 12/ <dig> polymorphism was absent from both pe_pgrs genes in  <dig> "m. canettii" strains and one other smooth tubercle bacillus analyzed, which are believed to represent the very early pre-bottleneck mtbc progenitors  <cit> .

from the overall distribution pattern of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism, a general evolutionary picture emerges  which conforms to, and confirms, previously published evolutionary scenarios for the tubercle bacillus  <cit> . as pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> showed the highest degree of homology and represent a typical tandem duplicate, one can deduce the molecular events which took place in the most ancestral tubercle bacillus strain. such a strain would be tbd1+ and harbor a single copy of a gene genetically very close to pe_pgrs <dig> or pe_pgrs <dig> . after duplication of this ancestral gene copy, further gene evolution led to the "m. canettii"-associated genetic configuration in which both genes lack the 12/ <dig> polymorphism, but have separately undergone isolated single nucleotide changes. during the adaptive period of the progenitor species, additional genetic changes took place, including the occurrence of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism in the one paralog . the fact that the gc content of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism is in the range of that of the mycobacterial host genome, may have ensured its maintenance throughout the clonal expansion of the mtbc progenitor. the data suggest that the polymorphism has remained stable throughout the expansion into the m. africanum-m. microti-m. bovis lineage and within the ancestral m. tuberculosis strains, and only with the emergence of modern tb has this variation been able to be transmitted  into the other paralog or deleted from pe_pgrs <dig>  such a genetic rearrangement occurred exclusively in pgg <dig> and pgg <dig> groups leading to the emergence of the two aforementioned disproportionately less frequent pgrst <dig> and pgrst <dig> subpopulations.

the emergence of these two newly defined modern subpopulations could be explained by the natural occurrence of homologous recombination between the two pe_pgrs gene sequences of strains from the pgrst <dig> population. the sequence environment  appears to be optimal for such a mechanism to take place, although it only seems to occur in the modern m. tuberculosis strains. it has already been shown, through in vitro experiments, that initiation of homologous recombination occurs in mycobacteria provided that sequence heterology does not exceed 10–12%  <cit> . such a requirement is largely fulfilled in the case of pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig>  but may eventually restrict homologous recombination events between other pe_pgrs paralogs that have undergone substantial levels of sequence divergence .

transfer of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism from the pe_pgrs <dig> to its neighboring paralog, or its reversion  in modern m. tuberculosis, is typical of a homologous recombination process called "gene conversion". such a gene replacement event is frequently observed among members of multigene families in bacterial genomes and contributes to both the maintenance of genetic information and creation of genetic diversity  <cit> . it is very unlikely that horizontal gene transfer  may have contributed to generate the two modern pgrs types of populations . indeed, random acquisition of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism through hgt would have generated an additional pgrs type population, harboring the polymorphism uniquely in its pe_pgrs <dig> sequence .

the recent generation of pgrst <dig> and pgrst <dig> subpopulations from the predominant pgrst <dig> accommodates either the double-strand break repair  or the synthesis-dependent strand annealing models  <cit>  as the molecular basis for this gene conversion event. it seems that the pre-synaptic double-strand breaks that initiate the homologous recombination event in the pgrst <dig> population occurred more frequently in pe_pgrs <dig> than in pe_pgrs <dig>  so that pgrst <dig> emerges more frequently than pgrst <dig>  under such circumstances, the dna polymerase will use the 12/ <dig> polymorphism-containing pe_pgrs <dig> sequence as homologous template to fill-in the broken pe_pgrs <dig> gene sequence, resulting in the pgrst2-associated genotype.

the distribution of the polymorphism types when informed by pgg and ssnp clusters strongly indicates that gene conversion events  occurred independently multiple times . indeed, all the pgg <dig> ssnp clusters each possess both pgrst <dig> and pgrst <dig> despite existing over clearly divergent evolutionary tracts. based upon the data set presented in figure  <dig>  conversion has occurred at least four times and reversion at least once . overall, the results clearly indicate that pgrst <dig> and pgrst <dig> subpopulations are modern m. tuberculosis lineages and emerged separately from pgrst <dig> strains through multiple gene conversion events. it is also interesting to note that two of the  <dig> strains identified with pgrst <dig> were laboratory strains , which have undergone significant in vitro culturing over decades, so that this conversion may not really occur or be tolerated well only under in vivo infection conditions.

reca-mediated gene conversion processes have been shown to occur in vitro between two rrna operon copies in m. smegmatis, uncovering the molecular mechanism underlying resistance to aminoglycosides  <cit> . as far as could be ascertained, this study provides the first concrete example and the most direct evidence for the natural occurrence of gene conversion events in mycobacteria. however, gutacker et al.  <cit>  have previously suspected recombination when addressing the distribution pattern of  <dig> polymorphic nucleotides within the rv0980c-rv <dig> intergenic region . this finding raises the question whether the complicated pattern of the rv0980c-rv <dig> isnps would be linked to the 12/ <dig> polymorphism-associated gene conversion event. indeed, if gene conversion extends to the homologous intergenic sequences of pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig>  the distribution profile of the isnps must be identical for both genes, as a result of gene replacement. the data show, that for both h37rv and cdc <dig>  whose pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> genes have undergone gene conversion, the isnps distribution patterns of the two genes are quite different. thus, unless the  <dig> polymorphic nucleotide positions are exceptionally unstable, the complicated pattern of this intergenic polymorphism does not seem to be associated with the gene conversion event described in the present paper.

it is well assumed that gene duplication and subsequent functional divergence are crucial for bacterial evolution as they play a major role in gene innovation and adaptation to changing environments  <cit> . in this context, it is worth mentioning that although pe_pgrs genes are restricted to mycobacterial species, they have preferentially expanded within the genomes of pathogenic mycobacteria, most likely through extensive gene duplication events coupled to genetic divergence during their adaptation to the very hostile intra-macrophagic environment  <cit> . we hypothesize that gene conversion may have contributed to the evolution of members of the pe_pgrs subfamily and may have participated in the generation of antigenic variation in their members  <cit> . it is striking that this type of recombination does not seem to occur in the mtbc members other than modern m. tuberculosis, and one wonders whether this is a mechanism that is specific to, or that may occur at greater frequency in modern m. tuberculosis. recently, lui et al.  <cit> , extending gutacker's analysis  <cit> , identified a mosaic polymorphic pattern  associated with a ppe gene . the authors hypothesize that small-scale gene conversion or recombination at hotspots near pe or ppe gene families has been an important mechanism for m. tuberculosis to escape immune surveillance.

as far as could be ascertained, the functions of pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> are unknown and, as yet, there is no indication whether they are essential or not. according to the present study, it could be assumed that both pe_pgrs genes may be dispensable for normal in vivo growth under certain conditions as they are absent from the genome of m. leprae, and pe_pgrs <dig> was frame-shifted in the two "m. canettii" and two other smooth tubercle bacilli strains analysed. by contrast, no such frame shift mutations were observed in the worldwide sequenced collection of mtbc strains, indicating that they may have evolved to assume an essential role in these particular widespread species. consistently, pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> belong to the so-called ivegi , a cluster of  <dig> in vivo-expressed genes, thought to encode cell wall components and participate in lipid metabolism required for mycobacterial survival in vivo  <cit> . within this island, pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> account among the  <dig> genes that display higher expression levels in mice samples compared to in vitro cultures. the ivegi locus harbors at least three genes , whose products were shown to be required in early interactions with the host cell as well as in persistence  <cit> . furthermore, genes playing critical roles in bacterial survival and fitness generally display higher acquisition rates for ssnp  in comparison to nssnp . we found that both pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> are under purifying selection as the majority of disadvantageous phenotypic changes would have been eliminated during evolution. we consistently found that, irrespective of the species, only particular non-synonymous changes are tolerated within certain nucleotide positions of both genes. these findings, and the fact that these genes appear to be preferentially expressed in vivo  <cit> , argue for a potential role in host-pathogen interactions.

finally, the question comes to mind whether the occurrence of the 12/ <dig> polymorphism could have enabled pe_pgrs <dig> to acquire a new or altered function that positively influenced the evolution of the mtbc. if so, it is also interesting to speculate whether the recent change from the pgrst <dig> to pgrst <dig> genotype in m. tuberculosis would further increase its fitness and/or adaptability. indeed, as with pgg <dig> isolates, pgrst <dig> appears to be frequently associated with outbreak strains and clustered cases, although not exclusively. by contrast, as mentioned earlier, the pgrst <dig> genotype is very rare among tb cases, and two of the four strains found to contain the genotype are in fact laboratory strains , thus seeming less prone to expansion and/or to have occurred as a more recent reversion event. although it is hard to believe that a single polymorphism in one or two genes would have dramatically impacted the evolution of the tubercle mycobacterial species, further experiments based on gene replacement and/or inactivation of the different forms of both pe_pgrs genes are needed to clarify this issue. it is worth mentioning that the 12/ <dig> polymorphism lies within a region of the protein, which according to the domain organization proposed by brenan et al.  <cit> , may represent a transmembrane helix. this location may be critical for the protein function inasmuch as pe/ppe protein complexes are strongly suspected to be involved in signal transduction  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
deciphering the evolution of bacterial populations is crucial to better understand the genetic traits behind the emergence of biomedically relevant strains. in the present study, we identified a novel, pe_pgrs-based, genetic polymorphism that expands our knowledge of the history of the tubercle mycobacterial species. this polymorphism provides a valuable marker of the ill-defined successful ancestor that emerged from the evolutionary bottleneck and from which the mtbc expanded. the findings also demonstrate the involvement of natural gene conversion events specifically in the diversification of the modern m. tuberculosis population. to our knowledge, this paper provides the first concrete example for the natural occurrence of such a molecular event in mycobacteria.
