BACKGROUND
loss of potency during differentiation is fundamental to the development of complex metazoans. pluripotent embryonic cells are able to give rise ultimately to all tissues of the adult body. in at least some mammals, pluripotency can be “captured” in vitro in the form of indefinitely self-renewing embryonic stem  cells. thus es cells can serve as a model for the differentiation of their in vivo counterparts into ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm derivatives.

pou5f <dig>  is a central regulator of pluripotency in mammals. in the mouse, deletion of pou5f <dig> causes loss of pluripotency in the inner cell mass and differentiation to trophoblast, revealing its earliest developmental role  <cit> . pou5f <dig> is also a potent reprogramming factor capable of facilitating the derivation of induced pluripotent stem  cells  <cit> . conditional knockout of pou5f <dig> in mouse primordial germ cells results in their apoptosis  <cit> , showing that the role of pou5f <dig> is not exclusively restricted to preventing differentiation.

pou <dig> is a vertebrate paralog of pou5f <dig> that has been best characterized in zebrafish. curiously, some vertebrate lineages, such as salamanders, marsupials and monotremes, have preserved both pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> in their genomes while in other vertebrates one or the other gene has become extinct  <cit> . thus squamate reptiles and eutherian mammals have only pou5f <dig> while birds and frogs have only pou <dig> . in xenopus, pou <dig> is present as three tandem copies - oct <dig>  oct <dig> and oct <dig> 

for reasons that are not fully clear, teleost pou <dig> was recently renamed pou5f <dig> despite multiple pieces of evidence for a closer affinity to pou <dig> orthologs of tetrapods. onichtchouk  <cit>  argued that since orthologous genes are defined “as originating from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of the compared genomes”, teleost pou <dig> is orthologous to mammalian pou5f <dig>  however, by the same argument, teleost pou <dig> is also orthologous to tetrapod pou <dig> orthologs, thus obviating the need for a name change. teleost pou <dig> shares more sequence similarity as well as conserved synteny with tetrapod pou <dig> <cit> , but perhaps more importantly, it was not proven whether the duplication event giving rise to each paralog occurred after or before the common ancestor of tetrapods and teleost fishes. if the latter, pou5f <dig> must have become extinct in teleosts as it has in some other tetrapod lineages such as birds and frogs.

pou5f <dig> and pou <dig> share a five-exon genomic structure that is characteristic of the class v pou family. exons  <dig> and  <dig> encode the poorly conserved n- and c-terminal transactivation domains, respectively, while exons  <dig> to  <dig> encode the highly conserved pou-domain, which comprises the pou-specific domain and the pou-homeodomain separated by a short linker region  <cit> .

RESULTS
newly identified pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> orthologs in vertebrates
to gain insight into the origins of the class v pou family of transcription factors in vertebrates, blast searches were performed for sequences homologous to mammalian pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>  previously unreported orthologs of pou5f <dig> were identified from a large number of vertebrate species, including the painted turtle , indian python  and coelacanth . pou <dig> orthologs were also identified in many species, including the alligator , painted turtle, coelacanth and spotted gar .

the avian pou <dig> ortholog - pouv - was identified in genome assemblies of the turkey , medium ground finch  and budgerigar , adding to the previously identified orthologs from chicken  <cit>  and zebra finch  <cit> . conserved open reading frames orthologous to chicken exon  <dig> could not be identified in other avian species. as chicken exon  <dig> was previously identified as unlikely to be homologous to exon  <dig> from non-avian orthologs  <cit> , all available avian genomes were re-examined. low stringency blast searches identified a single sequence  from the chicken whole genome shotgun  trace archives with homology to the proximal promoter and 5′ part of exon  <dig> of non-avian pou <dig> orthologs . in addition, a primordial germ cell-derived partial chicken est  included sequence with clear homology to the 3′ part of exon  <dig> from non-avian pou <dig> orthologs. the apparent absence of both the proximal pou <dig> promoter and the “canonical” exon  <dig> in other birds is probably due to gaps in their respective genome assemblies, suggesting that features of this region impart recalcitrance to sequencing. we conclude that the previously published cdna for chicken pouv represents a rare or non-canonical chicken-specific transcript  that was selectively isolated due to the pcr-based methods used.

alignment of a broad selection of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> translated sequences  showed almost no conservation within the n-terminal region between paralogs. however, a short motif with the consensus sequence xwyxf was moderately well conserved in both pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> , the first time a sequence signature conserved in the n-terminal domain of all family members has been identified. the previously noted n-terminal sequence magh and the deletion of a single arginine residue within the pou-homeodomain  <cit> , as well as an aspartic acid instead of glutamic acid at a site within the pou-specific domain identified by ye and colleagues  <cit> , were among the few fully conserved signatures specifically characterizing pou5f <dig> orthologs. we also noted that a second single-residue deletion in the linker region separating the pou-specific and pou-homeodomains of pou5f <dig> is specific to boreoeutheria, as it was not present in the elephant , armadillo  or any other vertebrate , suggesting a modification in function of pou5f <dig> among some eutherians.

a multigenic duplication gave rise to pou <dig> and pou5f1
to gain further insight into the evolution of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> and to confirm orthology where possible, we examined their synteny with other genes in available vertebrate genome assemblies . as previously reported  <cit> , pou <dig> is flanked by orthologs of npdc <dig> and fut <dig> in all vertebrate genomes for which synteny could be determined. in the coelacanth and turtle genomes, pou5f <dig> is flanked by a previously unreported paralog of npdc <dig> - a 9-exon gene expressed in differentiating neuronal cells  <cit>  - which we call npdc1l , indicating that the original duplication event that generated pou5f <dig> and pou <dig> was of a multigenic region. a search for npdc1/npdc1l homologs in other vertebrates identified sequences in several squamate reptiles, including python, anole lizard  and schlegel’s japanese gecko . phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences represent npdc1l and not npdc <dig> . thus extinction of pou <dig> in squamate reptiles  <cit>  was apparently associated with deletion of a larger, multigenic region that also included npdc <dig>  an additional rearrangement in the mammalian lineage resulted in ddx39b lying upstream of pou5f <dig> and the possibly simultaneous extinction of npdc1l. in the common ancestor of therian mammals , the h <dig> major histocompatibility complex was inserted between ddx39b and pou5f <dig> .

the duplication that gave rise to pou5f <dig> occurred in a common ancestor of gnathostomes
the apparent absence of pou5f <dig> in all non-sarcopterygian  genomes at first glance suggested that the origin of pou5f <dig> by duplication of pou <dig> is specific to the sarcopterygian lineage, or at least cannot be proven otherwise. however, the demonstration  that the duplication included at least one flanking gene, npdc1/npdc1l, provided an alternative strategy for determining its timing. we, therefore, searched for homologs of npdc <dig> and npdc1l in cartilaginous fishes , focusing on exons  <dig> to  <dig> as these are the best conserved. the identified sequences are summarized in figure  <dig>  three whole genome shotgun  contigs were identified from the elephantfish , which included exons  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these presumably form part of a common gene but this was not assumed for the purpose of this analysis. six wgs contigs were identified from the little skate , each containing a single exon. these included two homologs of exon  <dig>  one of exon  <dig>  two of exon  <dig> and one of exon  <dig>  thus the little skate genome appears to contain at least two homologs of npdc1/npdc1l. lastly, multiple overlapping expressed sequence tags  from the spiny dogfish  were identified, which together spanned almost the full coding region. these were combined in silico to produce a single sequence for analysis.

to maximize statistical power, we first compared the translated dogfish sequence  with npdc <dig> and npdc1l orthologs of other species, including a tunicate  npdc1/npdc1l homolog as an outgroup. the dogfish sequence clustered with npdc1l orthologs with a significant bootstrap value using three different methods for generating consensus phylogenetic trees  . in a comparison with the sequences from coelacanth, a species with both npdc1l and npdc <dig> , the dogfish sequence was clearly more similar to npdc1l than to npdc <dig>  indicating that its clustering with npdc1l in the consensus trees was not simply due to more rapid divergence from an ancestral npdc1-like sequence . this indicated that a gene more similar to npdc1l than to npdc <dig> has existed since at least as early as the common ancestor of chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, and that duplication of an npdc1/npdc1l ancestral gene must have occurred before the split between sarcopterygii and actinopterygii, since both groups have npdc <dig> orthologs that are more similar to each other than to npdc1l. to examine whether the duplication occurred even earlier in a common ancestor of chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the other chondrichthyan sequences from elephantfish and little skate . both of the elephantfish sequences  clustered with npcd <dig> orthologs and were separate from the dogfish sequence and npdc1l orthologs, regardless of the exon analyzed or the method used. for the little skate, one of the two exon  <dig> sequences and one of the two exon  <dig> sequences clustered with the dogfish sequence regardless of the analysis method and with significant bootstrap values for three of the six analyses , indicating that these sequences are orthologous to the dogfish sequence. the other little skate exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> sequences, plus the exon  <dig> sequence, each clustered with an elephantfish sequence to the exclusion of all other sequences in almost every case , with only one  exception . bootstrap values for this clustering were significant in three of the other eight analyses . these results strongly suggested that chondrichthyans collectively have both npdc <dig> and npdc1l paralogs and that both are present in the little skate genome. to exclude the possibility that the putative npdc <dig> ortholog  is a chondrichthyan-specific paralog of the dogfish sequence, we compared the two elephantfish sequences  to coelacanth npdc <dig> and npdc1l . both elephantfish sequences were more similar to coelacanth npdc <dig> than to either the dogfish sequence or coelacanth npdc1l, strongly arguing against a scenario in which the elephantfish sequences are derived from a chondrichthyan-specific duplication of an ancestral npdc1/npdc1l precursor that was more similar to extant npdc1l orthologs than to npdc <dig> orthologs. it may thus be concluded that orthologs of both npdc <dig> and npdc1l are present among cartilaginous fishes and, therefore, that the duplication event giving rise to pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> must have occurred at least as early as a common ancestor of extant gnathostomes.

putative pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> orthologs are present in chondrichthyans
since the duplication that gave rise to npdc <dig> and npdc1l can be reasonably assumed to have occurred in a common ancestor of cartilaginous fishes and other jawed vertebrates, we searched chondrichthyan databases thoroughly for homologs of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>  the identified sequences are summarized in figure  <dig>  in the elephantfish, we identified a single wgs contig encoding exons  <dig> and  <dig> and a separate contig encoding exon  <dig>  in the little skate, we identified a partial sequence for exon  <dig> and two homologs of each of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all on separate contigs. thus, while it was unclear which of the identified exons collectively form part of a common gene, at least two genes encoding class v pou domain transcription factors exist in the little skate genome. although synteny with other genes could not be determined from either of the chondrichthyan genome assemblies, various sequence signatures mostly resembled pou <dig> rather than pou5f <dig>  including a lack of the single arginine deletion within the pou-specific domain of pou5f <dig>   <cit> . this could be explained by a lineage-specific duplication of pou <dig> in the little skate, similar to the tandem pou <dig> triplication found in xenopus. however, the presence of a single homolog of both npdc1/npdc1l and pou2/pou5f <dig> in the elephantfish but two homologs of each in the little skate suggested the presence of both pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> orthologs in the latter species. to test this, we performed phylogenetic analysis of translated sequences for each exon . for the elephantfish sequences, exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> generally clustered with pou <dig> orthologs and this was highly significant for one analysis of exon  <dig> . this suggested that the elephantfish contains a single ortholog of pou <dig>  the elephantfish sequences always clustered with one little skate sequence to the exclusion of all others , indicating orthology. the remaining little skate sequences  and exon 5) generally clustered non-significantly with either pou <dig> or pou5f <dig> orthologs, with two notable exceptions. the little skate exon  <dig> sequence clustered with pou5f <dig> orthologs for all three methods of analysis. for one analysis this was highly significant . one of the little skate exon  <dig> sequences clustered non-significantly with pou <dig> orthologs for one analysis method  but clustered highly significantly with pou5f <dig> orthologs for the other two methods .

combined, the above data suggest that orthologs of both pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> exist among cartilaginous fishes. although the identity of every wgs contig cannot be assigned with confidence, evidence suggests that the little skate has both a pou <dig> and a pou5f <dig> ortholog, while the elephantfish has only a pou <dig> ortholog. this is consistent with the presence of both npdc <dig> and npdc1l orthologs in the little skate, but only an npdc1l ortholog in the elephantfish.

discussion
our data show that the duplication that gave rise to pou5f <dig> and pou <dig> occurred in a common gnathostomal ancestor. this can be deduced by combining two crucial pieces of evidence. first, conserved synteny shows that the duplication was multigenic and also gave rise to the paralogs npdc <dig> and npdc1l. second, orthologs of both npdc <dig> and npdc1l were identified in cartilaginous fishes. consistent with this deduction, we identified sequences in cartilaginous fishes that appear to correspond to either pou <dig> or pou5f <dig>  orthologs of both pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> are likely to still be present in the genome of the little skate, although their sequences appear less divergent from each other than they are in higher vertebrates. we also predict that an ortholog of pou5f <dig> is present in the spiny dogfish, since this species also retains an ortholog of npdc1l, but pou5f <dig> is presumably extinct in the elephantfish lineage.

a proposed model for the evolution of the pou2/pou5f <dig> family in vertebrates, based on the present data, is summarized in figure  <dig>  turtles, coelacanths and probably at least some elasmobranch fishes all have orthologs of both pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>  joining with marsupials, monotremes and salamanders  <cit>  as the only known lineages that have retained both genes. extinction of pou5f <dig> in birds and crocodilians may have been a single event dating to a common archosaurian ancestor. the absence of pou <dig> in both anole and python genomes also suggests a single extinction event in a common ancestor of squamate reptiles.

contrary to a recent assertion  <cit> , our study provides clear evidence that the pou <dig> gene of teleost and other actinopterygian fishes is a bona fide ortholog of tetrapod pou <dig> and not of pou5f <dig>  its recent renaming to pou5f <dig>  by the zebrafish nomenclature committee is, therefore, misleading. pou5f <dig> became extinct possibly in a common ancestor of actinopterygians, or at least of teleost fishes. this finding is important because misleading nomenclature can potentially lead to misleading assumptions regarding evolutionary conservation versus divergence of the respective roles of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> 

orthologs of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> from various vertebrates have been tested for their ability to maintain pluripotency in mouse es cells or to generate mouse or human ipscs. non-eutherian pou5f <dig> orthologs from axolotl  <cit>  and platypus  <cit>  both have this ability. pou <dig> orthologs from opossum, chicken, xenopus, axolotl and medaka are also able to maintain or induce pluripotency  <cit> , even in species that have retained both paralogs . surprisingly, although medaka pou <dig> can maintain mesc pluripotency, pou <dig> of another teleost fish, zebrafish, cannot  <cit> . neverthess, the conservation in function of class v pou family members despite very poor sequence conservation in the transactivation domains can perhaps be expected considering that deletion of either  of the n- or c-terminal domains did not affect the ability of mouse pou5f <dig> to maintain es cell pluripotency  <cit> . maintaining pluripotency in es cells probably serves as a model for only a limited proportion of the roles pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> serve in vivo. thus, although there is strong evidence for an ancient role for the common ancestor of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> at least in the maintenance of pluripotency, deducing distinct functions and roles between various pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> orthologs will probably require in vivo assays other than es cell complementation. this would include deducing the function of the conserved xwyxf motif in the n-terminal domain.

a general, although not universal pattern, appears to be that pou <dig> orthologs are more widely expressed in non-germline and non-pluripotent tissues than are pou5f <dig> orthologs. in marsupials, pou <dig> transcripts are detectable by rt-pcr in a wide range of adult tissues whereas pou5f <dig> expression is restricted to the germ line and early conceptuses  <cit> . nevertheless, pou <dig> is also differentially expressed in early tammar conceptuses  <cit>  and protein immunolocalization suggests that pou <dig> is a more specific marker than pou5f <dig> of very early epiblast  <cit> . interestingly in the sturgeon, pou <dig> transcripts were also detected in many adult tissues  <cit> .

pou <dig> orthologs seem to have a more important role than pou5f <dig> in early neural development. in the axolotl, pou <dig> but not pou5f <dig> is expressed specifically in the early neural plate and later in the developing hindbrain  <cit> , in a pattern similar to chicken pouv <cit> , xenopus oct <dig> and oct <dig> <cit>  and zebrafish pou <dig> <cit> , but not medaka pou <dig> <cit> .

the pattern of germ cell expression is also inconsistent among pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> orthologs. marsupial pou5f <dig> but not pou <dig> expression was detected by in situ hybridization in primordial germ-cells and early spermatogonia  <cit> , whereas both axolotl paralogs are expressed in germ cells  <cit> . germ cell expression has also been reported for chicken pouv  and xenopus oct <dig> <cit>  and among teleosts for medaka  <cit>  and cod  <cit>  but not for zebrafish. nevertheless, all pou5f <dig> orthologs that have been examined are expressed in germ cells, which may be significant. two modes of germ cell specification are recognized among vertebrates - predetermined  and inductive . in the predetermined mode, maternally inherited germ plasm is partitioned during cleavage to a subset of cells, which are then specified to become germ cells. in the inductive mode, there is no germ plasm and germ cells become specified by inducing signals from neighboring cells. the inductive mode is considered ancestral, with the predetermined mode independently derived in birds, frogs and teleost fishes  <cit> . the predetermined mode was proposed to be correlated with a derived mode of mesoderm induction  <cit>  as well as with a more pou5f1-like class v pou transcription factor  <cit> , although this preceded knowledge of the paralogous relationship between pou <dig> and pou5f <dig> among vertebrates  <cit> . we thus hypothesized that inductive germ cell specification is specifically correlated with the presence of a pou5f <dig> ortholog, irrespective of the presence of pou <dig>  <cit> . our present data are still largely consistent with this hypothesis. evidence suggests that turtles have inductive germ cell specification  <cit> , while retaining pou5f <dig> . to our knowledge, no data exist on the mode of germ cell specification in crocodilians, which would be expected to share a similar mode with birds. evidence suggests that the sturgeon  lacks germ plasm and is thus likely to have the inductive mode of germ cell specification  <cit> . the sturgeon genome has not been sequenced, so it is possible that it has a pou5f <dig> ortholog in addition to its previously reported pou <dig> ortholog  <cit> . indeed, johnson et al. <cit>  do refer to an unpublished “oct-4” sequence from sturgeon. in the sequenced genome of the spotted gar , we found all five exons of a pou <dig> ortholog but no exons corresponding to a pou5f <dig> ortholog. thus pou <dig> presumably became extinct in a common ancestor of gars and teleost fishes. to our knowledge, the mode of germ cell specification of gars has not been investigated. early studies of elasmobranch fishes cited by extavour and akam  <cit>  drew conflicting conclusions regarding the mode of germ cell specification in elasmobranch fishes and no studies have examined fishes of the subclass holocephali . further studies examining the mode of germ cell specification in several of the above lineages will provide powerful data to test the intriguing notion that the acquisition of predetermined germ cell specification permits or even drives the loss of pou5f <dig> <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study resolves the controversial evolutionary relationship between teleost pou <dig> and tetrapod pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>  it shows that class v pou transcription factors have existed at least since the common ancestor of gnathostome vertebrates and provides a framework for elucidating the basis for the lineage-specific extinctions of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>  which is likely to be informative for understanding their roles in development.
