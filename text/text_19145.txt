BACKGROUND
as one of the ubiquitously polluted heavy metals in ecosystem and modern industry, lead  may enter human body via many routes including airway, water and fo od  <cit> . pb exposure many cause chronic central and peripheral nerve damages in humans at all ages, with more concerns for the pediatric population. neurological consequences of pb poison in children are reported to include reduction in iq and learning/memory capability, hearing and language impairments and certain neuropsychological abnormalities  <cit> . the cellular mechanism underlying pb overexposure-induced neurotoxicity in the central nervous system is complex. of interest, recent studies have shown that chronic low level pb exposure may inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampal formation and affect the differentiation/maturation of the newly-generated granule cells, which may be relevant to behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with pb poisoning  <cit> .

we and others have identified a novel group of immature neurons located around layer ii of the adult cerebral cortex in relatively large mammals including guinea pigs, cats, rabbits, nonhuman primates and humans; these cells express doublecortin  and other typical immature neuronal markers  <cit> . these cortical immature neurons are more numerous in young relative to more mature animals and appear to be involved in neuronal structural plasticity  <cit> . more recently, these immature neurons are documented in brains of human infants and children  <cit> . the present study attempted to determine whether these immature cortical neurons were vulnerable to chronic pb exposure using young adult guinea pigs as an experimental model. data were also compared to dcx + neurons in the subventricular zone  and subgranular zone  that relate to adult neurogenesis  <cit> . efforts were also taken to explore if changes in cortical dcx expression overtly relate to local neurogenesis and neuronal death.

RESULTS
elevation of blood pb levels following chronic lead exposure
blood pb levels were increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl in the 2 month pb exposure group, to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl in the 4 month surviving group, and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl in the 6 month surviving group. among the age-matched control groups, blood pb levels were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl, respectively. statistically, blood pb levels elevated in the animal groups treated with lead acetate in a time-dependent manner at the  <dig> time points relative to age-matched control groups, with posthoc tests indicating no differences among the control groups .

decline in dcx + cells in cortical layer ii following chronic lead exposure
dcx + cells were found in multiple cortical areas of the guinea pigs, including pb exposure and age-matched control groups, as with previous reports  <cit> . thus, distinctly labeled dcx + cells with varying sizes and morphology formed a cellular band deep to layer i over the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortical areas. by visual comparison dcx + cells in pb exposure groups appeared to be reduced over all cortical areas in animals survived  <dig> and 6 months, but not in those survived for 2 months, relative to age-matched control groups .

the densities of dcx immunoreactive cells were quantified in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital areas. cell counting in the frontal cortex was performed on  <dig> equally-spaced  coronal sections passing the striatum, with the first one at the level of the first appearance of the anterior horn. cell counting in the parietal and temporal cortices were conducted in  <dig> equally-spaced  coronal sections around the “temporal pole” or the widest portion of the cerebrum, using the piriform fissure and lateral sulcus as landmarks for dividing the temporal and parietal areas  <cit> . cell counting in the occipital cortex was carried out in  <dig> equally-spaced  coronal sections passing the superior colliculus. compared to age-matched control groups, the density of the entire dcx + cell population around layer ii was significantly declined in the lead-treated groups surviving  <dig> and 6 months surviving groups over the parietal , temporal , frontal  and occipital  cortices. however, no significant reductions were detected in these areas at 2 months following pb dosing relative to control . the densitometric analyses on dcx + cells based on somal sizes indicated that the smaller  dcx + cells were decreased more significantly relative to larger ones  in all of the  <dig> analyzed areas .

decline in dcx + cells in the svz and sgz following chronic lead exposure
consistent with previous reports regarding lead-induced decrease in adult neurogenesis in small laboratory rodents  <cit> , the present study also noted a significant decline of dcx + neurons in the subventricular zone  and subgranular zone  in animals subjected to chronic lead exposure relative to controls . thus, there was a dramatic loss of dcx + cells around the svz in the pb-treated animals surviving  <dig>   <dig> and 6 months relative to controls. the same situation existed in the dentate gyrus wherein dcx + cells at the sgz were apparently reduced in the pb-treated relative to control guinea pigs . because dcx + cells were densely packed in the svz and sgz, an analysis was carried by simply using the optic density of labeling along the svz and sgz. the intensity of dcx immunoreactivity was reduced up to 50%  to 80%  in these two areas in the pb-treated relative to controls  .

lack of colocalization of brdu in cortical dcx + neurons
recently studies have shown that the dcx + immature neurons around layer ii could only occasionally be identified to colocalize with brdu after pulse-chase administration of this dna synthesis marker  <cit> . in the present study, double immunofluorescence was performed  <dig> and 4 months after brdu injection. no clear brdu colocalization with dcx or neun  was found in either the pb-treated guinea pigs or control animals in the  <dig> and 6 months surviving groups . at both time points, singly labeled brdu-containing cells were present in the superficial cortex, mostly over layers i and ii .

lack of active caspase- <dig> and fluoro-jade c labeling in cortical dcx + neurons
active caspase- <dig> and fluoro-jade c labelings are used to detect apoptosis and cell injury or death under various conditions  <cit> . to explore if the reduction of dcx + cells in pb-treated animals was overtly associated with cell death, we examined the expression of active caspase- <dig> in the cortex by single or double labeling. nuclear profiles were occasionally labeled in the cortex from pb-treated or control brains using an antibody that detect in situ caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . double immunofluorescence failed to find clear colocalization of active caspase- <dig> in any dcx + cells around layer ii . in fluoro-jade c stain, labeled cells were occasionally encountered in the cortex in pb-treated guinea pigs. no clear colocalization of fluoro-jade c and dcx was detected . as a positive assay control, fluoro-jade c labeled cells were found in the rat retina 24 h following induction of acute intraocular hypotension  <cit> , whereas no labeling existed in normal rat retina .

discussion
for centuries pb poisoning remains an environmental risk for human health in all societies  <cit> , and its deleterious impact on central nervous system of children is well documented but of particular medical concern  <cit> . children are more vulnerable to pb exposure than adults for many potential reasons, including their exposure to pb is favored by the habit of eating/chewing non-nutritive materials ; a child’s intestine absorbs pb much faster than that of an adult. another reason is that their blood–brain barrier  is not completely mature  <cit> . blood pb levels at or over 10-20 μg/dl in children are generally considered to cause debilitating effects on brain structure and function, manifested by neurobehavioral, learning and cognitive abnormalities  <cit> . however, recent studies have shown intellectual impairment in children with blood pb levels below 10 μg/dl  <cit> . for adults, high pb levels may penetrate into the brain by accumulating on the mature bbb and/or altering its functional competence  <cit> . in the present study, blood pb concentrations in the experimental guinea pigs have reached over 10 μg/dl, therefore, are above the threshold levels that would cause neurotoxicity in rats and humans <cit> .

overall, the mechanism underscoring pb-induced neurotoxicity in immature and adult brains appear to be complex, and may involve many aspects including oxidative stress, apoptosis, calcium homeostasis disruption and deregulation of cell signaling  <cit> . as one of the potential mechanistic concerns of pb-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain, several research groups have reported that chronic low level pb exposure inhibit adult neurogenesis in the small laboratory rodents  <cit> , which may contribute to behavioral and cognitive impairments. consistent with these reports, we have observed a dramatic loss of dcx + neurons in both the svz and sgz in young adult guinea pigs.

in general, the hippocampal formation is functionally related to behavioral and cognitive activities such as memory and learning. however, the neocortex plays an increasingly critical role in cognition in mammals during evolution in parallel with cortical expansion and the development of complicated network systems  <cit> . several research groups  have independently described the presence of dcx + cells around cortical layer ii in different adult mammalian species including guinea pigs, cats, non-human primates and humans  <cit> . while the origin, fate and developmental trajectory of these cells remain to be further characterized  <cit> , these cells can be activated by novel environmental exploration  <cit> , which suggests that they might be involved in cortical network activity under physiological conditions. our present results show that dcx + cells in different cortical areas in young adult guinea pigs decrease after treatment with  <dig> % lead acetate for  <dig> and 6 months. thus, chronic pb exposure can result in remarkable loss of immature neurons in broad neocortical areas. further, our present analysis also shows that loss of smaller sized dcx + cells appears more significantly relative to larger sized ones. dcx + cells with a larger somal size and more developed neuronal processes often co-localize with the neuron-specific nuclear protein , a mature neuronal marker  <cit> . thus, it appears that the smaller dcx + cells with a less mature phenotype may be more sensitive to pb exposure. because these small-sized neurons are more common than the large-sized ones in young mammals, pb pollution could significantly impact cerebral neuronal development in children.

hypothetically, reduction of dcx + cortical immature neurons in pb-treated animals could be resulted from loss of cells or decline in dcx expression. the former condition could be a consequence of reduced cell genesis and/or increased cell death. it is currently controversial as to whether layer ii dcx + immature are or can be generated in postnatal life due to inconsistent brdu birth-dating data  <cit> . in this study we could not find a clear colocalization of brdu in cortical dcx + neurons at  <dig> and 4 months after brdu injection. the lack of active caspase- <dig> and fluoro-jade-c colocalization indicates that dcx + cortical cells in pb-treated guinea pigs are not overtly associated with apoptotic death, nor do they appear apparently injured.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that pb exposure induces a decline of dcx-expressing immature neurons in the neocortex as well as in the established neurogenic sites in adult guinea pigs, with a greater effect seen in the relatively small-sized subpopulation of the cells in the cortex. the findings from this study point to a potential new cellular substrate in mammalian cerebrum that would be expected to be vulnerable to chronic pb exposure and toxicity in the pediatric population.
