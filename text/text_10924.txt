BACKGROUND
metagenomics and host-microbe molecular interaction studies are rapidly expanding our understanding of the indigenous gut microbiota and the contributions of microbes to human health  <cit> . these efforts are complementary to the numerous reports describing health benefits associated with the ingestion of probiotic bacteria  <cit> . probiotics are living microorganisms which confer health effects on the host when administered in sufficient amounts  <cit> . strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are the most commonly applied probiotics in food products. members of these genera are residents of the human intestine and have a long history of safe use in foods and beverages. health benefits conferred by probiotics can be specific to the gastrointestinal tract  or occur at peripheral mucosal sites in the human body   <cit> .

there is substantial evidence that an important mechanism by which probiotics provide health benefits is through modulation of immune functions  <cit> . differences among probiotic strains to stimulate immune cells towards pro- and anti-inflammatory responses have been shown in studies measuring cytokine production in vitro  <cit> . these comparisons have resulted in the identification of strains inducing similar responses in vivo. for example, ratios of il- <dig> to il- <dig> produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in response to different probiotics in vitro were correlated to their protective capacity in a mouse model of colitis  <cit> . similarly, recent studies on the mechanisms of probiotics highlight their effects on epithelial barrier function via toll-like receptor  <dig> signaling and the generation of regulatory dendritic cells and regulatory cd4+foxp3+ t cells in peripheral tissues  <cit> . the latter mechanism is linked to the administration of a collection of five strains which induced a high il-10/il- <dig> ratio in co-culture with immune cells  <cit> . administration of these strains was shown to have a therapeutic effect in experimental mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and was associated with enrichment of cd4foxp <dig> tregs in the inflamed regions  <cit> .

the cell products of probiotics that are responsible for modulation of cytokine induction are largely not known but might involve modifications of some of the known microbe associated molecular patterns  such lipoteichoic acids   <cit>  and proteins localized on the bacterial cell surface  <cit>  which interact with toll-like receptors. additionally cell-surface associated bacterial glycosylated proteins or exopolysaccharides  <cit>  may interact with other host pattern recognition receptors including the c-type lectins and scavenger receptors found on antigen presenting cells  <cit> . these extracellular and secreted products produced by probiotic cells are the likely targets for strain-dependent interactions with host cells and have been the focus of several recent reviews  <cit> .

certain strains of lactobacillus plantarum are marketed as probiotics and reported to confer various health effects including immunomodulation  <cit> . the genome sequence of l. plantarum strain wcfs <dig> is known  <cit>  and extensive bioinformatics tools  <cit> , molecular models  <cit> , and a database of genome hybridization profiles  <cit>  are available for this organism. it is a single colony isolate of strain ncimb <dig>  which was shown to survive gastrointestinal passage after oral administration to healthy volunteers  <cit> . global gene expression profiling of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> in the intestinal contents of the human gut and conventionally-raised and germ-free mice has shown that this organism adapts for growth in vivo by modification of its cell-surface composition and metabolism in a diet-dependent manner  <cit> . human duodenal transcriptional response profiles have also been obtained in response to ingestion of l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  <cit> . notably, exponential phase and stationary phase l. plantarum wcfs <dig> cells elicited distinct human duodenal transcript profiles which appeared to mainly result from differential modulation of canonical nf-κβ-dependent signaling pathways associated with immune tolerance  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to identify genes involved in immunomodulation by l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  the il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokine levels elicited by peripheral blood mononuclear cells  upon stimulation with l. plantarum wcfs <dig> and  <dig> other lactobacillus plantarum strains were determined. we compared the il- <dig> and il- <dig> stimulating phenotypes of each strain to its genome composition determined by comparative genome hybridization  to identify candidate l. plantarum genes with the capacity to affect cytokine production in pbmcs. the immunomodulatory potential of these gene products was confirmed for l. plantarum wcfs <dig> gene deletion mutants and found to be dependent on the growth-phase of the l. plantarum cultures.

RESULTS
immunomodulation of pbmcs is a variable phenotype in l. plantarum
a total of  <dig> l. plantarum strains from distinct  food, environmental, and gastrointestinal sources  were investigated for their capacities to stimulate pbmcs to produce the cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  comparisons of cytokine amounts induced among different donors in response to the l. plantarum strains showed that the l. plantarum cultures induced a similar range of il- <dig> but up to 10-fold different levels of il- <dig> . this result is agreement with previous studies showing that pbmcs respond differently depending on the donor from which the cells were isolated  <cit> . however, the capacity of individual l. plantarum strains to induce cytokines production in pbmcs was similar among the different donors relative to the other strains tested. for example, l. plantarum kog <dig> consistently induced the highest amounts of il- <dig> whereas strain cip <dig> induced the highest ratios of il- <dig> to il- <dig>  collectively, the  <dig> l. plantarum strains induced, on average, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in pbmcs over a 14- and  <dig> - fold range, respectively, and il-10/il- <dig> ratios over a  <dig>  - fold range . strain wcfs <dig> induced relatively low il- <dig> amounts , moderate amounts of il- <dig> , and consequently a moderate to low il-10/il- <dig> ratio  compared with the other strains .

identification of candidate genes involved in immunomodulation
to identify candidate l. plantarum genes involved in the modulation of the immune response, random forest models  <cit>  were used to compare l. plantarum cgh profiles with the relative amounts of il- <dig> and il- <dig> and il-10/il- <dig> ratios induced by the strains in co-culture with pbmcs . pbmcs from different donors incubated with replicate l. plantarum cultures were used for these models to take into account the levels of variation in cytokine production. comparisons of l. plantarum strain genotype to the il-10-stimulating capacities resulted in the identification of  <dig> different chromosomal loci and a total of  <dig> genes that might influence il- <dig> production . in comparison, concise correlations between l. plantarum cgh profiles and il- <dig> amounts were not found. one of the genes correlated with il- <dig> amounts was l. plantarum wcfs <dig> lp_ <dig>  l. plantarum strains harboring this gene stimulated the production of il- <dig> in  <dig> -fold higher amounts, on average, compared to l. plantarum strains for which this gene was absent. lp_ <dig> encodes a hypothetical intracellular protein of unknown function  <cit> . the remaining five genes with putative roles in il- <dig> modulation comprise a putative  <dig> gene operon  encoding pts19adcbr, an n-acetyl-galactosamine/glucosamine phosphotransferase system . strains harboring these genes were associated with induction of lower amounts of il- <dig> by pbmcs.

comparisons between l. plantarum strain-specific cgh profiles and il-10/il- <dig> ratios from pbmcs resulted in the identification of four l. plantarum wcfs <dig> loci which correlated with il-10/il- <dig> values . l. plantarum wcfs <dig> plnefi and plng  and lamb  were most commonly present in strains stimulating low il-10/il- <dig> ratios. these genes are under the control of the auto-inducing peptide -based quorum sensing  two-component regulatory systems  found in l. plantarum  <cit> . the genes plnefi and plng encode two bacteriocin peptides, a bacteriocin immunity protein, and an atp - binding cassette  transporter  <cit> . the lamb is the first gene in the l. plantarum lambdca operon and shows 30% amino acid identity to the s. aureus agrd-processing protein agrb required for aip modification and export  <cit> . the other l. plantarum genes associated with specific il-10/il- <dig> ratios are lp_ <dig> and lp_ <dig> coding for prophage r-lp <dig> remnant proteins p2b protein  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these genes are conserved among l. plantarum strains stimulating high il-10/il- <dig> ratios in pbmcs. the functions of prophage r-lp <dig> and other complete prophages in l. plantarum wcfs <dig> genome are not known  <cit> . because the different prophages found in l. plantarum wcfs <dig> share high levels of sequence homology and potential functional redundancy  <cit> , these genes were not examined further.

verification of the roles of the candidate genes in immunomodulation
to validate the influence of the candidate l. plantarum genes on pbmc cytokine responses, lp_ <dig>  pts19adcbr, plnefi, and plng deletion mutants were constructed for l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  a previously constructed l. plantarum wcfs <dig> lama lamr  double mutant was used to examine the potential roles of the lambcda qs-tcs on pbmcs. this strain was selected because lama and lamr encode the response regulators of the  <dig> tcs  regulating the expression of the lamd aip in l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  <cit> . in the Δlama Δlamr mutant, expression levels of lamb and the other genes in this operon were at 5% of the levels found in wild-type cells  <cit> .

wild-type and mutant l. plantarum wcfs <dig> cells harvested in the stationary- and exponential phases of growth were examined for their capacity to stimulate il- <dig> and il- <dig> in pbmcs. overall, among the donors examined, il- <dig> and il- <dig> were produced in response to l. plantarum at levels between  <dig> to  <dig> pg/ml and  <dig> to  <dig> pg/ml, respectively . notably, exponential cultures of wild-type l. plantarum wcfs <dig> and most mutant strains stimulated pbmcs to secrete higher amounts of il- <dig> and il- <dig> than stationary-phase cells .

l. plantarum strains harboring the plnefi, plng or lamb loci were associated with the stimulation of lower il-10/il- <dig> ratios by l. plantarum in the pbmc assay . in agreement with the gene-trait correlations, the plnefi, plng, and lama lamr deletion mutants of strain wcfs <dig> induced higher il-10/il- <dig> ratios than the wild-type strain . however, the effects of the plnefi deletion on cytokine induction in different donors was not highly significant compared to wild-type l. plantarum when the p value was adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing  p value =  <dig> ) . mutants deficient in the abc- transporter plng induced significantly higher cytokine ratios compared with l. plantarum wild-type cells . these differences were observed only for wild-type and mutant cells harvested during exponential phase growth . immunomodulation of the Δlama Δlamr mutant was also substantially different compared to wild-type l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  the Δlama Δlamr mutant induced significantly higher il-10/il- <dig> ratios  and il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  amounts in pbmcs . these effects were partially dependent on the growth-phase of the l. plantarum cells. il-10/il- <dig> ratios and il- <dig> amounts induced by wild-type and mutant cells were significantly different when exponential phase cultures were used in the pbmc assay, whereas il- <dig> and il- <dig> amounts also differed when stationary-phase cells were examined .

in agreement with the gene trait matching correlations, the Δpst19adcbr mutant induced significantly higher amounts of il- <dig> than wild-type l. plantarum  . similarly, the il-10/il- <dig> ratio was significantly higher  upon stimulation with l. plantarum Δpst19adcbr compared with the parental strain . l. plantarum strains harboring lp_ <dig> were also predicted to induce higher il- <dig> production levels compared with strains lacking this gene. however, the l. plantarum lp_ <dig> deletion mutant stimulated equivalent amounts of il- <dig> and somewhat higher il-10/il - <dig> ratios  relative to wild-type l. plantarum wcfs <dig> . although the lp_ <dig> mutant induces a modest, yet significantly different, il-10/il- <dig> response relative to the parental strain, these results are not in agreement with the immunomodulatory effects predicted for this gene.

in summary, of the  <dig> mutants tested here, three  significantly affected the immune response of pbmcs in different donors according to the phenotypes predicted from the gene-trait matching data . the plnefi mutant also affected the immune response in the predicted manner but this was not significant considering the adjusted p value. the Δlama Δlamr mutant conferred the largest differences on the induction of il- <dig> and il- <dig> and the il-10/il- <dig> ratio by l. plantarum .

discussion
this study demonstrated the diverse capacities of l. plantarum strains to stimulate cytokine production in human pbmcs and confirmed the contributions of specific l. plantarum genes to modulate these responses. forty-two l. plantarum strains induced pbmcs to secrete il- <dig> over an average 14-fold range. this range was similar to il- <dig> amounts stimulated by  <dig> bifidobacterium longum strains  <cit>  and the  <dig> to 15-fold differences in cytokine amounts induced in pbmcs by multiple lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species  <cit> . moreover, we found that variation in il- <dig> and il- <dig> amounts and il-10/il- <dig> ratios induced by the distinct l. plantarum strains was higher than reported previously  <cit> . this result was probably due to the analysis of more strains in the present study , which were isolated from diverse environmental niches encompassing a greater genetic and phenotypic diversity of the l. plantarum species. such strain-specific differences should therefore be taken into consideration when selecting a probiotic lactobacillus culture for health conditions which are dependent on modulating immunity such as in the prevention of allergy, eczema, or inflammatory bowel disease.

to identify l. plantarum genes with roles in modulating immune cell responses, l. plantarum genetic diversity was correlated with strain-specific capacities to induce cytokines in pbmcs. genes with putative contributions to the observed pbmc responses were further investigated in l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  a similar gene-trait matching approach previously resulted in the identification of a l. plantarum mannose-specific adhesin   <cit>  and genes which modulate dendritic cell responses  <cit> . although the gene-trait matching approach has been successful, it should be recognized that only a subset of immunomodulatory cell components produced by l. plantarum was likely identified here. firstly, the identified immunomodulatory genetic loci were restricted to genes in the l. plantarum wcfs <dig> reference strain genome. secondly, genes with high levels of sequence conservation such that they are not distinguished by cgh  might be excluded from detection. for example, l. plantarum highly conserved lta biosynthesis and modification genes known to have established effects on mammalian immunity were not found in this biodiversity-based gene-trait matching approach. finally, genetic assessments do not take into account strain-specific variations in gene expression, translation, or post-translational modification of proteins with immunomodulatory effects.

despite these limitations and the considerable variation in the production of cytokines by pbmcs from different donors, the present study demonstrated that gene-trait matching is also suitable for the identification of genes that affect cytokine levels in the mixture of immune cells collectively termed pbmcs. the products of aip-based qs-tcss and the n-acetyl-galactosamine/glucosamine phosphotransferase system identified here might constitute a new class of bacterial cell products which are recognized by host receptors. the findings are significant because these genes were identified using intact cells which likely have multiple interactions with immune cells such that single genes only confer incremental effects.

l. plantarum wcfs <dig> lamb, a processing/export protein of the aip-based qs-tcs lambdca  <cit> , was correlated with immunomodulation of pbmcs. lamb, a transmembrane protein, is under the control of two response regulators lama and lamr  <cit> . a l. plantarum Δlama Δlamr mutant investigated in this study was found to induce pbmcs to secrete significantly higher amounts of the cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  in a previous report, global transcript profiling of the lama lamr deletion mutant showed that the lambdca system is auto-regulated and controls the production of several surface-associated proteins, stress-associated functions, and surface polysaccharides  <cit> . higher amounts of surface polysaccharides produced by l. plantarum Δlama Δlamr decreased the biofilm-forming capacity of the mutant strain  <cit> . polysaccharides produced by some lactobacillus species are known for their immunomodulatory effects either by direct interactions with immune cells or by shielding mamps on the bacterial cell surface from detection by the immune system  <cit> . therefore the observed pbmc il-10/il- <dig> ratios for l. plantarum might either be mediated directly through the lambdca system and the cognate secreted peptide, or indirectly through cell products  under the control of this regulatory system. the latter is supported by the genetic similarities between lambdca and the staphylococcus aureus agr system, an aip-based qs-tcs which controls the evasion of innate host defenses by s. aureus through the production of secreted peptides and proteases  <cit> .

the plantaricin biosynthesis pathway of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> is also controlled by an aip-based qs-tcs  <cit>  and genes required for plantaricin production and transport contributed to l. plantarum effects on pbmcs. plantaricin is a bacteriocin composed of two small secreted peptides  which destabilize the integrity of the plasma membrane of susceptible cells  <cit> . l. plantarum strains harboring plnef and plni encoding a plantaricin immunity protein, and/or plng encoding a membrane bound abc-transporter induced pbmcs to secrete il- <dig> and il- <dig> in amounts that yielded lower il -10/il- <dig> ratios . similarly, wild-type l. plantarum wcfs <dig> conferred lower il-10/il- <dig> ratios compared to the plnefi and plng deletion mutants, although this was significant only for the plng mutant  and not the mutant lacking plnefi . the identification of the aip plantaricin is intriguing because human antimicrobial peptides such as defensins secreted in the gut are known to modulate immune responses  <cit>  and suggest that antimicrobial peptides of bacterial origin might have similar capacities. these findings are also compatible with a recent study showing that plantaracins can modulate dendritic cell responses  <cit> . moreover, several independent studies showed that l. plantarum wcfs <dig> genes involved plantaricin biosynthesis and activity, including plni and plnf, are induced in the mouse gut  <cit> , thereby indicating that plantaricin production is active in the intestine where it might come into contact with mucosal immune cells.

another of the confirmed genes with immunomodulatory capacities was the pts19adcbr locus coding for a cell membrane-associated n-acetyl-galactosamine/glucosamine phosphotransferase system. the relevance of the pts19adcbr genes in adaptation to the intestinal ecosystem was also demonstrated by their higher expression levels in the intestine of conventionally-raised and germ-free mice  <cit> . moreover, in lactobacillus johnsonii, a putative mannose phosphotransferase gene locus with 43% amino acid identity to the l. plantarum wcfs <dig> pts19adcbr cluster was found to be important for long term persistence in vivo  <cit> . although the regulatory signals for expression of these genes are unknown, immunomodulatory effects conferred by pts19adcbr might influence the ability of l. plantarum to modify the intestinal environment for survival in the gut.

cytokine profiles of the lp_ <dig> deletion mutant were not in agreement with the il- <dig> stimulating capacity predicted for this gene by gene-trait matching. this result exemplifies the need for mutation analysis to confirm gene-trait predictions, which are likely to encompass false-positive associations. a similar conclusion was drawn during the identification of the l. plantarum msa gene  <cit> . moreover, the product of lp_ <dig> is predicted to be intracellular, which contrasts the predicted subcellular location of all other genes examined here   <cit> . this finding supports the notion that surface-localized proteins or components are the most likely candidate-participants in host-microbe interactions  <cit> . thus far, the majority of the known immunomodulating mamps known for lactobacilli are extracellular or cell surface associated products such as lta, exopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycan, although intracellular cpg-containing oligodeoxynucleotides  produced by some lactobacilli are able to induce il- <dig> production in immune cells  <cit> . these mamps are recognized by specific pattern recognition receptors  such as toll-like receptors  and nucleotide oligomerization domain -like receptors  <cit> . to identify the mechanisms underlying the effects of aip-based qs-tcss and the n-acetyl-galactosamine/glucosamine phosphotransferase system on immune cells, the cellular products encoded by the genes in these pathways should be investigated to identify the specific cell types among the pbmcs, which include lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages, that recognize these compounds as well as the specific mechanisms leading to altered cytokine production.

comparisons of mutant and wild-type l. plantarum wcfs <dig> cells included examination of the effects of culture growth phase on the stimulation of pbmcs. exponential- and stationary-phase l. plantarum wcfs <dig> cultures were evaluated because the growth phase of probiotic cells was previously shown to influence the immune responses to probiotic bacteria in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . using human pbmcs, we found significant growth-phase dependent differences in the immunomodulatory capacities of the wild-type and mutant l. plantarum cultures. collectively, the exponential-phase l. plantarum wcfs <dig> cultures stimulated higher absolute amounts of il- <dig> and il- <dig> and hence appear to induce heighted immune responses by pbmcs compared with stationary-phase cells. notably, this result was not due to extensive l. plantarum growth because antibiotics were added to the pbmc growth medium to prevent bacterial overgrowth which would generate artifacts from acidification of the medium causing pbmc cell stress or death. moreover, intact and lysed l. plantarum strains cells collected from the exponential and stationary phase of growth do not show striking differences in their tlr <dig> signaling activity and there was not a clear trend among all strains tested . therefore the higher amounts of cytokines induced by exponential phase bacteria are unlikely to be caused by differential cell lysis resulting in the release of intracellular cpg dna, a known mamp recognized by tlr <dig> 

comparisons of wild-type and mutant l. plantarum cultures also showed growth-phase dependent effects. the il- <dig> amounts and il-10/il- <dig> ratios induced by the pts19adcbr deletion mutant were significantly different from wild-type l. plantarum wcfs <dig> for only the stationary-phase cultures. stationary-phase cells of the Δlama Δlamr mutant also induced significantly higher amounts of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in compared with l. plantarum wcfs <dig> harvested at the same growth phase. however, differences between il-10/il- <dig> ratios induced by Δlama Δlamr and wild-type cell differed only for exponential phase cultures. this result might have been partially due to the extensive alterations in expression of l. plantarum Δlama Δlamr in actively growing cultures  <cit> , such that differences in expression of lambdca and lamkr regulated genes might have influenced the ability of the exponential-phase l. plantarum cells to stimulate different pbmc il -10/il - <dig> ratios. a similar result was found for the comparisons of l. plantarum plng , the other  <dig> tcs system examined, although the specific growth-phase-dependent modifications of the plantaricin system on cytokine production in pbmcs is not presently known.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study compared the genetic and phenotypic diversity of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> to identify cell components of this species with the capacity to modulate human pbmc responses. we successfully identified several l. plantarum wcfs <dig> genes that are associated with the production of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines by pbmcs and established that the immune response to l. plantarum can be significantly altered by the deletion of specific l. plantarum cell surface proteins. the increased il-10/il- <dig> ratios of the l. plantarum mutants indicate that these cultures would be more protective against intestinal inflammation compared with wild-type cells. these effects might be mediated by the down-regulation of local inflammatory responses through various subsets of t cells producing a collection anti-inflammatory cytokines. as a result of this study, strain selection for protection against intestinal inflammation might include screening for strains lacking the lamb, plng, or pts <dig> homologs or by modifying culture growth conditions or food delivery matrices to minimize the expression of these genes in vivo. such studies are required to distinguish between health effects conferred by individual probiotic strains and to develop methods to ensure that probiotic cells express host-modulatory cell products at the appropriate level and time in food products and the human gut.
