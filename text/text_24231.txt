BACKGROUND
the proportion of the elderly population that experiences dementia is rapidly increasing, and both human and animal studies have indicated a relationship between reduced masticatory function  in elderly individuals and cognitive impairment  <cit> . in addition, data from human and animal reports reveal that an impoverished environment  is associated with aggravation of aging-related cognitive decline; for a recent review see  <cit> . indeed, compared with geriatric persons with poor levels of physical and social activities, exercise programs for institutionalized older people improve cognitive function  <cit> . consistent experimental data from aged mice and rats maintained in ies also point to spatial memory impairments in morris water maze tests  <cit> . water maze tests require acquisition and retrieval of spatial information  <cit> , and this hippocampal-dependent task  <cit>  can be impaired by a variety of structural/functional changes including aging  <cit> , ie  <cit> , and occlusal disharmony  <cit> .

human epidemiological studies  <cit>  and experimental data from rodents  <cit>  also show direct correlations between aging, masticatory imbalances , and cognitive decline, but with no references to environmental conditions. experimental approaches imposing masticatory deprivation, like tooth-loss  <cit> , long-term soft diet  <cit> , or bite-rise occlusion, suggest a behavioural displacement, but more research is needed into the effects of rehabilitation. here we examined outcomes at the intersection of masticatory deprivation, environmental conditions, and spatial memory impairments in adult  and aged  mice. to assess the effects of masticatory rehabilitation on the morris water maze task, we used different sequences of hard diet  and soft diet  on the aged and young mice and included an environmental component with an ie or enriched environment . to mimic masticatory rehabilitation, we fed some animals with hd followed by sd, with a return to hd, and compared them to animals without rehabilitation .

RESULTS
masticatory reduction, environmental changes, and water maze tests at  <dig> and  <dig> months.

learning rate
figure  <dig> depicts the diet regime, age, and environmental influences on learning rate of the best five performances of each experimental group on the fourth training day. the top panel  indicates the significant between-group differences in the learning rates, and the bottom  panel shows individual performances and group means. note that at 6m, impoverished conditions associated with a reduction in masticatory activity  were also associated with lower learning rate values compared with control  or masticatory rehabilitated  mice. on the other hand, spatial learning performance was impaired in aged ie mice regardless of diet regime but less so in the rehabilitated group. similarly, ee-hd/sd animals independent of age showed lower performance than ee controls  or rehabilitated mice . however, rehabilitation + ee in aged mice improved learning rates up to ee control levels. indeed, on the fourth training day, learning rate was influenced by diet regime  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) with interactions between environment and age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). pairwise comparisons  showed significant differences between mean values of ie6m-hd  and ie6m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ie6m-hd and ie6m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ie6m-hd and ie18m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ie6m-hd and ee6m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ie6m-hd/sd and ie6m-hd/sd/hd  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ie6m-hd/sd/hd and ie18m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); and ie18m-hd/sd/hd and ee18m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). for ee-only animals, we identified the following values: ee6m-hd and ee6m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ee6m-hd/sd and ee6m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); ee18m-hd  and ee18m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ); and ee18m-hd/sd and ee18m-hd/sd/hd  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

swim speed and distance travelled
because a reduction in escape latency during training might simply suggest that mice learned to swim faster across days and or abandoned the thigmotactic strategy that is preferred during the very first days of training, in figure  <dig> we show total distance travelled   and respective mean trajectories ; distance travelled on the quadrant opposite the platform ; and the average swim speed . three-way anova of these data revealed that distance travelled was influenced by age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and diet  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) with significant interaction between environment and age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). as expected, the best performances in learning rates were associated with shorter distances travelled. indeed, pairwise comparisons showed that ie6m-hd/sd  travelled longer distances than ie6m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and ie6m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), but shorter than ie18m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and ie18m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). consistent with learning rate results, ie6m-hd also travelled shorter distances than ee6m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). in addition, ee18m-hd/sd  swam longer distances to find the platform than ee18m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) or ee18m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

in keeping with these findings, the distance travelled in the opposite quadrant to the platform was also influenced by age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and diet  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), but no interactions were identified. pairwise analysis demonstrated that ie6m-hd  swam less in the opposite quadrant than ie6m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and ie18m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). in addition, ee18m-hd/sd  swam longer distances in the opposite quadrant than ee18m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and ee18m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

finally, three-way anova indicated that swim speed was affected by age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and diet  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) with significant interaction between environment and age  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). however, pairwise comparisons showed that ie6m-hd/sd  swam faster than ie6m-hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and ie6m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) but slower than ie18m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). in addition, ie6m-hd/sd/hd swam slower than ie18m-hd/sd/hd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), and ie18m-hd/sd swam faster than ie18m-hd/sd/hd  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). however, swim speed did not change in animals raised in enriched conditions with a single exception: ee18m-hd  swam slower than ee18m-hd/sd   =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

taking these results together, learning rates seem to be directly related to distance travelled, but swim speed values do not, suggesting that the behavioural effects are not the result of sensorimotor changes and that masticatory activity seems to affect spatial learning in the morris water maze test. the findings also indicate that a combination of increased masticatory activity and ee in animals with a previous reduction in masticatory activity may benefit both young and aged mice.

body weight and diet regimes
to detect a possible influence of diet regimes and environment on body weight, we weighed all animals after behavioural tests. one-way anova revealed significant influence of diet regimes on body weight of ie animals  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), and ie6m-hd/sd  weighed significantly less than ie6m-hd  or ie6m-hd/sd/hd  mice . no body weight differences were detected in ee animals. we did find a single significant inverse correlation between body weights and performance in the water maze in ie6m-hd/sd mice .

in addition, t-tests revealed no significant differences between body weights of ie6m-hd/sd and ee6m-hd/sd mice  and no differences in learning rates. based on this finding, we speculated that the sedentary ie lifestyle is associated with being overweight and that the hd/sd diet regime in ie may reduce food intake. observing the active lifestyle of ee animals , we noted that it reduced weight gain independent of the diet regime. however, these differences disappeared after 18m in all diet regimes.

discussion
in the present report, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of masticatory rehabilitation and ee would recover impaired spatial learning induced by a combination of ie and reduced masticatory activity. to mimic sedentary or active lifestyles, respectively, we raised mice from weaning onwards in either ie or ee. to mimic a reduction in masticatory activity, we fed a soft diet to mice previously fed with a hard diet  and compared water maze performances of this group with two other groups fed with continuous hard diet  or with a sequence of hard, soft, and hard diets . we found that a reduction in masticatory activity and ie impaired spatial learning on the morris water maze and a combination of masticatory rehabilitation and ee recovered spatial learning abilities of both adult and aged mice.

aging cognitive decline and environment
we tested adult and aged mice raised in ie or ee for spatial memory and learning using the water maze paradigm. the results revealed that all ie and ee adult mice could learn and remember the position of the hidden platform after four training days; however, only aged ee mice met the criterion of 60% or more in learning rate . indeed, the aged ie mice learning rate was on average near the chance level . these findings suggest that after  <dig> months of impoverished conditions, the hippocampal requirements for spatial learning were spared in young mice and could be activated after training. as expected, memory capabilities became worse when advanced age was combined with ie; under these conditions, age-related spatial learning decline was aggravated. in contrast, ee-raised aged mice exhibited relatively unimpaired spatial learning in water maze tests, suggesting that the consolidation and retrieval mechanisms for these memories were spared under enriched conditions. these observations replicate previous results of ours and others in mice and rats undergoing spatial learning and memory tests  <cit> .

more recently, we investigated the impact of institutionalization on aged humans, living sedentarily under poor conditions of cognitive and motor–sensory stimulation . participants underwent neuropsychological tests, and outcomes were compared to those of an aged control group living in the community with their families . our findings revealed significantly higher scores among community-living participants. consistent with this finding, institutionalized patients after  <dig> months of motor–sensory and cognitive stimulation  experienced significant improvement in their performances on neuropsychological tests  <cit> .

rehabilitation of masticatory function to prevent adult and aging-related spatial learning losses
a number of studies using a variety of behavioural assays, including the morris water maze  <cit> , passive avoidance  <cit> , and radial arm maze  <cit> , indicate that long-term soft-diet feeding or extraction of molar teeth results in learning and memory deficits  <cit> . recent studies with the morris water maze demonstrated that mice fed a hard diet required significantly less time to reach the platform than experimental mice and spent significantly more time in the former platform area, suggesting that hard-diet feeding is associated with improved spatial memory  <cit> . in addition, one-year-old  <cit>  or 18-month-old  <cit>  adult mice fed with a soft diet, compared to a solid-diet group, showed lower spatial performances on the morris water maze. similarly, samr <dig> and samp <dig> mice fed a solid diet performed better in the eight-arm radial maze than mice fed a powdered diet  <cit> . samp <dig> mice reach adult maturity at  <dig> months of age when learning and memory deficits become apparent in a variety of behavioural tests  <cit>  and when reduced masticatory activity accelerates age-related learning and memory decline  <cit> . occlusal disharmony also aggravates age-dependent deficits in spatial learning in the morris water maze  <cit> ; see  <cit>  for recent reviews. moreover, monkey studies demonstrate that when occlusal disharmony is removed, the associated stressful response disappears  <cit> .

here the results add a new piece of information, demonstrating a vigorous effect of diet changes on spatial learning in the morris water maze after a reduction in masticatory activity imposed with a soft diet on mice previously fed a hard diet. we also demonstrated that these spatial learning losses can be promptly recovered by masticatory rehabilitation at adulthood  but that aged mice  require a combination of environmental stimuli and masticatory rehabilitation to obtain similar effects. because the morris water maze is a hippocampal-dependent task, we suggest that rehabilitation of masticatory activity in adult mice and a combination of ee and masticatory rehabilitation in aged mice may rescue hippocampal function.

we emphasize that the animals were deprived of their masticatory activity but not fully suppressed in an effort to simulate the human condition. taking all of the results together, we can speculate that oral rehabilitation and sensory–motor and cognitive stimulation may help protect human subjects from age-related cognitive decline and that these interventions would be more effective if implemented as early as possible.

CONCLUSIONS
an imposed reduction in masticatory activity by administration of a soft diet to sedentary mice previously fed a hard diet impaired spatial learning in the morris water maze. the rehabilitation of masticatory activity of these deprived mice at adulthood, independent of environment, recovered spatial learning losses, and a combination of enriched environment and rehabilitation benefited significantly both young and aged mice. we are now investigating the cellular and molecular changes associated with spatial learning recovery after masticatory rehabilitation.
