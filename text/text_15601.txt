BACKGROUND
cryptosporidium is a genus of protozoan parasites which are a major cause of gastrointestinal infection worldwide. symptoms of human cryptosporidiosis include diarrhoea abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting and low grade fever. these are usually self-limiting, albeit after  <dig> or even 3 weeks, but can be prolonged or invasive and life-threatening in patients with severe t-cell immune-deficiency  <cit> . cryptosporidium spp. are also increasingly recognised as an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries  <cit> . treatment options are limited, with only one specific licenced therapeutic. of the  <dig> cryptosporidium spp. currently named, cryptosporidium hominis and cryptosporidium parvum are the most common causes of cryptosporidiosis in humans globally. research into the biology of the organism has been partly hampered by the lack of an effective cell culture system for propagation and the limited availability of genomic sequence data, impacting, for example, on progress in understanding the taxonomic position of the protozoan, therapeutic drug discovery, and identification of diagnostic, virulence and subtyping markers.

whole genome sequences produced using sanger sequencing techniques, are publically available for single isolates of three species which have historically provided reference genomes for the mainly anthroponotic c. hominis , the zoonotic c. parvum , and c. muris  which primarily infects rodents  <cit> ; ncbi bioprojects: prjna <dig> prjna <dig>  prjna32283). recently, new whole genome sequences have been made available from next generation sequencing  platforms, providing updated versions of the genome sequences for c. hominis tu <dig> and c. parvum iowa ii and new genome sequences for additional isolates: c. hominis ukh <dig>  c. meleagridis ukmel <dig> and c. baileyi tamu-09q <dig> . the powerful technologies provided by ngs have dramatically reduced the cost and time required for whole genome sequencing, greatly increasing our knowledge of cryptosporidium spp. by, for example, allowing in-depth, high-resolution comparison of isolates and deep sequencing of selected loci for investigation of parasite population variability. however, significant challenges exist for generation of whole genome sequence data, largely because even the most sensitive sample preparation kit for the generation of sequencing libraries demands at least 1 ng genomic dna; c. parvum oocysts each contain 40 fg dna  <cit>  thus requiring an estimated  <dig>  ×  <dig> highly-purified oocysts. human stool samples received at diagnostic laboratories tend to be small in volume and contain relatively small numbers of cryptosporidium oocysts amongst very large numbers of non-target organisms, mainly bacteria, which is problematic for the production of the purity of genomic dna required for analysis. whole genome sequences generated to date have either utilised experimental animal infections for propagation of sufficient material  <cit>  or obtained and processed large volumes of animal faeces from natural infections  <cit> ; both approaches restrict the information available to a small number of sufficiently abundant isolates and may introduce the potential for strain selection bias. the former is most especially unsustainable for large-scale investigations for practical, financial and ethical reasons, particularly for c. hominis which has no symptomatic animal model and requires passage in gnotobiotic piglets  <cit>  or immunosuppressed mongolian gerbils  <cit> . enrichment of genomic cryptosporidium dna for wgs from stools has recently been described using whole genome amplification but significant contamination was reported  <cit> .

here we describe the development and validation of a protocol for preparation of genomic cryptosporidium dna from routinely submitted diagnostic human stool samples suitable for whole genome sequencing. the method has the following characteristics which specifically address the challenges described above: enhanced purification of oocysts degradation of non-cryptosporidium contaminants, and use of an ngs library preparation kit capable of processing as little as 1 ng of genomic dna.

RESULTS
characterisation of isolates prior to wgs
characterisation by c. parvum and c. hominis-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction  revealed no evidence of the presence of more than one species in any of the stools tested. only the expected species were identified by sanger sequence analysis of the 18s rrna actin, hsp <dig> and cowp genes. gp <dig> subtypes were identified as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  there was no evidence from the sequencing chromatograms that any of the isolates were of mixed populations of cryptosporidium species or gp <dig> subtypes.table  <dig> properties of cryptosporidium oocyst and dna preparations from two pilot phase stool samples

evaluation of oocyst preparation methods in the pilot phase
salt-floated suspensions of 1 × 106c. parvum and c. hominis oocysts yielded after ims,  <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> oocysts  density gradient centrifugation of the same original number of oocysts in salt-floated suspension yielded 2×105c. parvum oocysts  and <2 × 104c. hominis oocysts  and after bleach treatment  <dig>  ×  <dig> and < <dig>  ×  <dig> , respectively, indicating that ims was the more efficient method for purification of oocysts derived from small volume stool samples . due to undetectable numbers of oocysts in the cscl-prepared c. hominis suspension, this was not processed further. although cscl has been used successfully for oocyst preparation from bulk samples collected repeatedly from a naturally infected animal  <cit> , the collection of bulk or multiple repeat samples is not practical for stool collection from most human patients.

the use of quantitative pcr  to derive oocyst numbers in the salt-floated suspensions resulted in estimates  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  lower than those derived from microscopic counts of intact oocysts in good condition . either cryptosporidium dna was lost during the extraction process or there was uncertainty of the measurements. the presence of pcr inhibitors co-extracted with the dna would be expected to lead to an underestimation of dna concentration by qpcr in these stool-derived samples when compared to standard curves derived from cloned template. oocyst numbers derived from qpcr of dna extracted from the more highly-purified ims and cscl suspensions were closer to actual microscopic counts than those for the salt-floated suspensions ; it is likely that dna from more highly-purified oocysts was more closely represented by the standard curve plasmid dna and therefore more accurately quantified than that prepared from the salt-floated suspensions.

a substantial decrease in the mass of bacterial dna was identified after both ims and bleach-treatment  reduced by  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  compared with the salt-floated suspensions. cscl-prepared c. hominis dna was not processed for library preparation due to its low total dna concentration . total dna concentration in the dna extracts from the c. parvum ims and cscl-prepared samples and the c. hominis ims-prepared sample, measured by qubit fluorometric quantitation, was >1 ng and therefore sufficient for ngs library preparation.

these measurements highlighted the utility of the ims and bleaching processes for reduction of extraneous dna without significantly affecting the amount of cryptosporidium dna. seth-smith et al. also used ims to reduce non-target organisms prior to chlamydia trachomatis dna extraction  <cit>  however, in the case of cryptosporidium, the oocyst wall affords the opportunity to further reduce bacterial contamination with brief sodium hypochlorite treatment without damaging the target dna, whilst providing challenges with regard to fracturing the oocyst wall prior to dna extraction when dealing with low numbers of oocysts.

evaluation of dna preparation in the main phase
of the  <dig> stools processed nine produced sufficient total dna for library preparation, of which two contained c. hominis and seven c. parvum. the median low threshold cycle  value for suspensions that generated sufficient dna for whole genome sequencing  was significantly lower than for those that did not  . although there was some overlap in ct values, suspensions containing oocysts that were in good condition were more likely to produce whole genome sequences . although qpcr was not a reliable indicator of oocyst abundance in salt floated suspensions in the pilot phase, the combination of qpcr, oocyst counts and visual condition proved to be a good and practical predictor of suitability of salt-floated suspensions for further processing in the main phase . the importance of microscopic examination is notable because although oocyst counts are time consuming so is ims processing , and pre-screening in this way would maximise use of resources in larger scale applications. post ims there was clear delineation of ct values between sufficient and insufficient preparations the median ct value for those that generated sufficient dna for whole genome sequencing  was significantly lower than those that did not  . there was a significant relationship between cryptosporidium 18s rrna gene qpcr and mass of dna in the final extracts  indicating this comprised a sufficiently large proportion of cryptosporidium dna. although 16s rrna gene qpcr had proved useful in the pilot phase to demonstrate reduction in bacterial dna, it was not used in the main phase. cryptosporidium 18s rrna gene qpcr was evidently more useful in process monitoring, with the pilot phase results showing that cryptosporidium genome copies could more accurately be derived from these data, with the additional benefit of reduced analysis preserving material for downstream use.fig.  <dig> relationship between total oocyst numbers, ct values and concentration of recovered dna. oocyst numbers , and ct values in the salt-floated suspension were determined prior to processing, and compared to final dna recovery. red, wgs successful; blue, <1 ng dna available

results of next generation sequencing
including both pilot and main phases a total of three c. hominis and seven c. parvum whole genomes were successfully sequenced, reads aligned to reference genomes, and contigs de novo assembled and annotated, with an additional sequence generated via the cscl method for the c. parvum isolate in the pilot phase.

in the pilot phase sequencing c. parvum ukp <dig> using the illumina miseq achieved 100 % coverage of the c. parvum iowa ii reference genome at a mean  <dig> x depth using the ims-based method, 100 % coverage at a mean  <dig> x depth using the cscl-based method, and for c. hominis ukh <dig> 98 % coverage of the c. hominis tu <dig> reference genome at a mean  <dig> x depth . when aligned to the reference genomes,  <dig>  % of reads from c. hominis ukh <dig>   <dig>  % of reads from c. parvum ukp <dig> ims preparation and  <dig>  % reads from c. parvum ukp <dig> cscl preparation mapped to the reference sequences the percentage of unmapped reads were likely from residual bacterial contamination  and sequencing errors and was greater for the cscl preparation compared to the ims preparations.table  <dig> quality of whole genome sequences generated directly from stools containing c. hominis and c. parvum

in the main phase eight of the nine dna extracts generated high-quality data using the illumina hiseq the proportion of reads mapping to the reference sequence ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % with  <dig>  to  <dig>  fraction of the reference genome covered confirming the suitability of the illumina nextera xt sample preparation for generation of cryptosporidium genomes from clinical isolates . one sample failed to produce sufficient data probably because insufficient library dna was added at the pooling stage.

the post-assembly genome improvement protocol   <cit>  improved assemblies produced from the sequenced reads were of high-quality and statistics describing them are given in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> assemblies  <dig> could be assembled into less than  <dig> scaffolds, with the assembly n <dig> metric equal to just over 1 mb for most assemblies . using the bowtie <dig> read aligner  <cit>  with the default settings we were able to align between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of sequenced reads as concordant pairs to the final genome assemblies, indicating that the genome assemblies are relatively complete. rapid annotation transfer tool   <cit>  was able to transfer between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  gene annotations from c. parvum iowa ii to the assemblies thus providing a sound basis for further studies into sequence and structural variation. although notably greater depth of coverage was achieved with the illumina hiseq  than with the miseq, the miseq genome assemblies were nonetheless of equivalent quality: see the statistics for ukh <dig> and ukp <dig> in table  <dig> table  <dig> summary of improvements made to the initial genome assemblies by pagit

the assembly statistics  include the number of scaffolds, scaffold n <dig> metric, scaffold mean length , and the total size of the final assembly. gene annotations were transferred by ratt out of a total of  <dig> gene annotations in the reference assembly. the “contaminant sequence” column refers to the total length non-concordantly mapping read pairs that have been assembled separately and identified as non-cryptosporidium sequence  and bacterial sequence 



in order to investigate the possibility of bacterial contamination for each isolate, any read pairs that did not map concordantly to the final de novo contig assemblies were assembled separately. from these assemblies of contaminants, contigs greater than 300 bp were blasted  <cit>  against all cryptosporidium assemblies available on the national center for biotechnology information   <cit> . using a basic local alignment search tool  e-value < 1− <dig> potential cryptosporidium sequences were filtered out of these assemblies. the remaining non-cryptosporidium contigs  were subsequently blasted against all bacterial genomes available on the ncbi, and using an e-value < 1− <dig> the total amount of bacterial sequence was identified . the amount of contaminating sequence was too small, too fragmented , or too low in complexity to reliably identify any particular contaminating bacteria species.

the serine tri-nucleotide repeat rich gp <dig> gene sequence is used in sub-typing to study the taxonomy and transmission of the cryptosporidium parasite  <cit> . searching for the gp <dig> gene sequences from each isolate in the respective assemblies with blastn produced 100 % alignments with an e-value =  <dig>  of  <dig> to 755 bp in length: although no alignments were reported over the low complexity regions at the start of the gp <dig> gene because blast filters out such regions before aligning sequences. the 18s rrna gene sequences were similarly found by blast in the assemblies with 100 % sequence identity, split into two alignments due a low complexity region in the middle of the sequence with each alignment having a length of around 250 bp to 400 bp. exceptions were ukh <dig>  where two copies  of the 18s rrna gene region could be found, all between  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % sequence identity, and ukh <dig> where there were three blast hits of  <dig>  % sequence identity . no evidence was found of mixed species populations. note that five copies of the 18s rrna gene are found in the c. parvum iowa ii reference genome assembly and this indicates that the assembly process used in this study has collapsed the 18s rrna gene regions, typically into just one copy.

the genome data from this study have been deposited on the ncbi  database as individual bioprojects  under the umbrella bioproject prjna <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a method for the high-quality sequencing of cryptosporidium spp. isolates using the transposome-based nextera xt library preparation and illumina sequencing platform directly from routinely submitted human stools left over from diagnostic testing. this has the advantage of reducing the requirement for the use of animals for in vivo amplification of oocysts to extract sufficient genomic cryptosporidium dna for whole genome sequencing as was used to generate the reference genomes  <cit>  and potentially extending the possibilities for more widespread investigation of cryptosporidium. the generation and comparison of benchmark genomes from all cryptosporidium species and genotypes would help establish more definitive taxonomy than is currently possible based on the analysis of only a tiny proportion of the genome using sanger sequencing even of multiple loci  <cit> . global surveillance and analysis of cryptosporidium genomes from widespread and representative infections would be valuable for identification of possible drug targets, new diagnostic, virulence and subtyping markers.

the samples prepared in this study were chosen because of sufficient sample volume  and adequate concentration of oocysts in the salt-floated suspension. even so the concentration of dna available after the purification processes was often at the limit of that acceptable for the illumina technology used. it is evident that to extend the utility of illumina sequencing to stools of smaller volumes or with lower concentrations of oocysts, strategies such as the application of kits requiring <1 ng dna would be useful, as might whole genome amplification  which has proven capable of increasing genomic dna in cryptosporidium samples  <cit>  and may be of use for producing sufficient material  <cit> .

we are currently using this technique to compare illumina sequencing libraries generated from native and wga-amplified dna from clinical samples . this allows the approaches to be compared and investigated for artifactual mutations that, for example, have been reported to occur at a rate of approximately  <dig> in  <dig> to  <dig> for φ29-based methods  <cit> . although it required additional steps and is susceptible to contamination, wga could expand the application of illumina sequencing to still more samples  <cit> .

we conclude that in our laboratory using the current nextera xt library preparation methods the following selection criteria are valuable predictors of likely successful generation of high-quality c. parvum or c. hominis genome sequences from stool samples:original stool sample volume >1 ml

initial salt-floated oocyst suspension 18s rrna gene qpcr ct <  <dig>  and >9× <dig> oocysts that are in good condition with very few empty oocysts

post-ims-bleach treatment 18s rrna gene qpcr ct <  <dig>  and qubit result >1 ng total dna



however in other laboratories different factors  may affect measurements, and the use of different criteria may be necessary.

we have described the generation of high-quality sequences of cryptosporidium directly from stool samples and assembled these into  <dig> high-quality draft genomes. our method coupled with the availability of reference sequences for comparison, removes the requirement for the use of animals to passage and amplify oocyts prior to genome sequencing. it reduces the cost, and extends the potential for this technology to be applied to the rapid and accurate genomic characterisation of clinical isolates, for the purposes of control of transmission, and treatment during outbreaks.
