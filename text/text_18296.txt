BACKGROUND
status epilepticus is an emergency in clinical practice, but the detailed mechanism of its pathology is less well known. in fact, very few studies have examined the clinical consequences of status epilepticus as a single morbidity  <cit> , although a progressive sequence of electroencephalographic  changes during generalized convulsive status epilepticus  has been described  <cit> . gcse typically begins as partial-onset status epilepticus and secondarily generalizes  <cit> .

recently, by combination of eeg monitoring and a sensitive silver method of gallyas  <cit> , we discovered two "dark" neuron populations that may be of crucial importance in generalization of epileptic seizures and the progression of status epilepticus  <cit> . histopathologically, epileptic seizures can produce "dark" morphological change in neurons  <cit> , and these affected neurons are selectively and "spectacularly" visualized by the gallyas silver method  <cit> . in our study, epileptic seizures induced by focal-cortical application of k+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine  developed into status epilepticus with a slow oscillation  at  <dig> h, which was correlated with the appearance of both "dark" neurons in the pontine reticular formation  and "dark" interneurons in the hippocampus  <cit> . the temporal profile of neuronal injury in the hippocampus is well described  <cit>  and it is known that spontaneous seizures preferentially injure interneurons in the hippocampus  <cit> . therefore, in this study we focused on the prf.

it is not known whether the giant neurons of the prf are involved in the progression of status epilepticus, although electrophysiological studies have suggested that the prf may participate in generation and maintenance of the epileptic state  <cit> . nevertheless, experimental histopathology experiments have not investigated the prf for the presence of "dark" neurons following pilocarpine- or kainic acid-induced status epilepticus  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the prf for "dark" neurons  <dig> hours after the induction of epileptic seizures. focal-cortical application of 4-ap was compared with systemic administration of 4-ap, pilocarpine or kainic acid. "dark" neurons were found in the prf in all prolonged status epilepticus cases. it is also known from previous studies that brief seizures can confer tolerance against prolonged seizures and neuronal damage  <cit>  for example, prior administration of 4-ap protects against kainic acid-induced neuronal cell death  <cit> . to investigate this, a cumulative approach was invoked to bring about status epilepticus. when the first attempt with 4-ap or pilocarpine failed to induced status epilepticus, we used kainic acid on the following day. despite possible tolerance against cell injury, "dark" neurons were still consistently found in the prf.

RESULTS
focal-cortical 4-ap crystal application
out of the four rats examined histopathologically, three entered status epilepticus at  <dig> h. all three rats had giant "dark" neurons in their prf , both in the oral and caudal pontine reticular field  and also in the medullary reticular field . one animal did not enter status epilepticus, and no "dark" neurons were found in its prf .

i.d.: animal i.d., prf dn: number of „dark” neurons in the prf, bhv.scr.: behavioral scoring with racine scale; se: if status epilepticus developed  or not , eeg: treiman's eeg phases,

the relative numbers of "dark" neurons averaged from five 60-μm sections of the pontine and medullar reticular formation are expressed with a semi-quantitative grading scale as follows: +: 1- <dig> "dark" neurons; ++: 5- <dig> "dark" neurons, +++: 15- <dig> "dark" neurons.

systemic injections of 4-ap
out of the four rats examined, two entered status epilepticus at  <dig> h, and they had giant "dark" neurons in their prf , in the pno, pnc and in the mesencephalic and medullary reticular field . two animals did not enter status epilepticus, and no "dark" neurons were found in their prf .

systemic injections of pilocarpine
five of the six rats examined entered status epilepticus at  <dig> h, and all five had giant "dark" neurons in their prf , in the pno, pnc  and gi . one animal did not enter status epilepticus, and no "dark" neurons were found in its prf .

systemic injections of kainic acid
two out of the four rats examined entered status epilepticus at  <dig> h, and both had giant "dark" neurons in their prf . the two other animals did not enter status epilepticus, but they reached stage- <dig> of the behavioral scoring: forelimb clonus and "wet dog shakes". in one of these animals 4- <dig> "dark" neurons were found in its prf, the other had none .

systemic injections of kainic acid as a second treatment
in these animals, the 4-ap or pilocarpine injection did not produce status epilepticus. kainic acid was injected on the following day. despite the possible tolerance effect in these animals that would reduce the numbers of "dark" neurons, the "dark" neurons were consistently found in the prf. out of the four rats examined, two received 4-ap a day before. after kainic acid injection, these rats entered status epilepticus at  <dig> h and their prf contained 15- <dig> giant "dark" neurons . two rats received pilocarpine treatment a day before. after kainic acid injection, one of these rats entered status epilepticus at  <dig> h and had 10- <dig> "dark" neurons in its prf. the other rat had multiple seizures without status epilepticus and had 4- <dig> "dark" neurons in its prf .

eeg analysis
the eeg was examined in eight rats . five rats entered status epilepticus after their respective treatment. the one-hour power spectral density  showed a high peak at 1- <dig>  hz in case of focal-cortical crystal treatment , a prominent peak at  <dig> - <dig>  hz and a high increase in power at around  <dig> hz in case of pilocarpine treatment  at  <dig> hour. from the four kainic acid injected rats as a single treatment two entered status epilepticus and they had a prominent peak at  <dig> - <dig>  hz in their psd . in case of rat ak2e, after its 4-ap i.p. injection, the one-hour psd showed only a smaller peak at  <dig> hz, but after its kainic acid injection there was a prominent, high peak at around  <dig> - <dig>  hz .

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that the pontine reticular formation is affected in status epilepticus. it is not completely unknown that the prf may participate in the generalization and maintenance of epileptic state. glutamate microinjections into the pons induces electrographic seizures and clonic convulsions  <cit> . infusion of nmda antagonists into the prf inhibits the generation of tonic and clonic seizures induced by electroshock or pentylenetetrazol  <cit> . prf neurons are implicated in seizure propagation in several forms of generalized clonic seizures, including audiogenic seizures  <cit> . furthermore, human fmri and spect studies have also shown the involvement of the pons in epileptic seizures  <cit> .

the injured giant "dark" neurons of the prf in this study were found by the gallyas silver staining method. this sensitive method highlights the injured cells in a golgi-like manner, but does not provide any information about the fate of the highlighted "dark" neurons. on the other hand, it has long been known that the epilepsy-induced "dark" neurons are able to recover  <cit> . previous histopathological studies have demonstrated that the compacted "dark" neurons have a high potential for recovery, but this capacity is influenced by the local environment with its metabolic processes  <cit> . the "dark" neurons at issue are in an otherwise undamaged environment, so we regard the observed "dark" neurons in the prf as injured cells with the capacity to recover. nevertheless, the gigantocellular network of the prf was affected in our study during status epilepticus, independently of the way the status epilepticus was induced.

regarding the functional consequence of injury to the gigantocellular network of prf, it is well known from the classic discovery of moruzzi and magoun, that high-frequency stimulation of the reticular formation produces an arousal response in the cortex. the stimulation is the most effective in bringing about arousal when it is applied to the prf  <cit> . lesions of the reticular formation produce a state of deep sleep or coma, block the arousal, and lead to low frequency/high amplitude activity in the eeg  <cit> . this resembles the slow oscillation developed in our experiments in connection with status epilepticus, so we could regard the observed slow oscillation as the electrophysiological consequence of the formation of "dark", compacted, dysfunctional neurons in the prf.

the observed slow oscillation is not completely unknown in epilepsy research. in kindled animals, delayed slow rhythmic outlasting activities were reported at ~ <dig>  hz, which gradually developed following successive acute seizures  <cit> . the occurrence of interictal slow delta activities were also reported in patients with epilepsy, and the presence of these electric activities was associated with more severe forms of epilepsy  <cit> . rhythmic diffuse delta frequency activity was also reported in non-convulsive status epilepticus  <cit> .

treiman et al. described the distinct eeg patterns that occur during prolonged episodes of status epilepticus. they found that these identifiable eeg patterns occur in a predictable order during status epilepticus, and the progression of eeg changes during status epilepticus follows a common electrical sequence regardless of the initiating factors  <cit> . the last phase of these patterns was called periodic epileptiform discharges, and it has a low frequency. later this periodic epileptiform discharges  phase was subdivided into early and late peds  <cit> . early peds were characterized by monomorphic periodic discharges with a relatively short flat background at around ~ <dig>  hz. late peds showed complex polymorphic periodic discharges with a longer flat background at less than ~ <dig>  hz  <cit> . the slow oscillations in our study would represent the early peds, and it is worth noting that significantly elevated glucose utilization rates were observed in the prf during this phase of status epilepticus  <cit> .

our hypothesis about the generalization of the slow oscillation is the following. the giant neurons of the prf are receiving intense activation during the repeated epileptic seizures, and their intense activation causes the ascending reticular activating system  to promote the generalization of the seizures. the giant neurons of the prf are glutamatergic, and they innervate each other, sending their long ascending projections primarily to the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, which in turn project to widespread cortical regions  <cit> . the seizure-related hyper-excitability of these glutamatergic neurons is reflected in their elevated glucose utilization. the sustained depolarization, on the other hand, results in elevated intracellular ca++ levels in the prf and ultimately an injured, compacted state: the formation of "dark" neurons. we think that the giant "dark" neurons are suspending their activity or not responding properly to synaptic  activation. this will result in a depression of the functioning of the prf network and because of the depression of the aras, generalized, synchronized slow oscillation in the cortical eeg develops  <cit> . it is notable that the observed slow oscillation, and especially the late peds phases of the status epilepticus are resemble to the 'slow' neocortical oscillation described by steriade  <cit> .

generalized slow neocortical activity is also associated with eeg changes during the state of coma  <cit> . this could be important, as experimental animals in prolonged status epilepticus could also enter post-ictal coma before full recovery  <cit> . lesions in the prf are associated with brainstem coma  <cit> , but lesions in the reticular formation have been found in brains of people who have post-polio fatigue syndrome  <cit> . similarly post-ictal fatigue is one of the symptoms that can help distinguish patients with epileptic seizures from those with non-epileptic seizures  <cit> , and this could also suggest the involvement of the prf in epileptic seizures.

CONCLUSIONS
we argue that the prf is affected during status epilepticus, and its involvement could be important in the progression of the observed slow oscillation corresponding to the periodic epileptiform discharges phase of status epilepticus.
