BACKGROUND
microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats , are tandem repeats of 1– <dig> nucleotides and are present in all eukaryotic genomes. based on their locus-specificity, high level of polymorphism , co-dominant inheritance, relative abundance and reproducibility, ssrs have become valuable tools for genetic mapping, association mapping, comparative mapping, diversity analysis, and qtl analysis  <cit> .

the large number of expressed sequence tags  deposited in public databases is a valuable resource to develop ssr markers. moreover, est-derived ssrs  can be more readily transferred between  species relative to ssrs obtained from random genomic sequences  <cit> . some previous studies indicated that est-ssrs are less polymorphic than genomic ssrs  <cit> , while others suggest the rate of polymorphism in est-ssrs was similar to that of genomic ssrs  <cit> .

conventional experimental methods  <cit>  for developing ssrs are laborious, time consuming and expensive. meanwhile, with the ever increasing number of sequences in public databases, in silico approaches to screen for ssrs have become a practicable and inexpensive alternative for many species. several software packages have been developed to detect ssrs in dna sequences, especially in ests  <cit> ). public est databases may contain redundancy in sequences of a particular gene, e.g. different alleles derived from heterozygous individuals or from different genotypes. some redundant sequences can contain information on length-polymorphisms in ssrs. in the past this information was often lost due to the elimination of sequence redundancy before ssr identification  <cit> . only very recently, by comparing the genomic sequences of the two rice subspecies indica and japonica, have polymorphic ssrs been detected successfully  <cit> . also, feingold et al.  <cit>  recognized the length-polymorphisms present in the est database and manually identified polymorphic ssrs. up to now there are no software packages that can identify polymorphic ssrs from ests in an automated way. our research aims to develop a new tool, called polyssr, for the identification of polymorphic ssrs using est sequence redundancy. the versatility of the tool was shown in a number of species .

RESULTS
identification of polymorphic ssr
a substantial frequency of ssrs in est sequences were predicted by sputnik  <cit>  using the default settings, and ranged from 9%  to 28%  . clustering of est sequences using cap <dig> with 95% similarity over  <dig> nucleotides resulted in clusters and a large number of singletons, both of which may contain ssrs . in the non-redundant sequences of the species, between 13%  and 27%  contained ssrs, and between 18%  and 43%  of clusters contained an ssr. when using polyssr between 7%  and 22%  of the ssrs in the clusters were found to be polymorphic. for almost all of the predicted polymorphic ssrs, primers could be designed that allow pcr amplification of the ssr  resulting in  <dig> putative polymorphic markers for tomato,  <dig>  for potato,  <dig> for brassica,  <dig>  for arabidopsis,  <dig>  for rice and  <dig>  for chicken. these polymorphic ssrs can either be perfect  or imperfect  .

experimental validation of potentially polymorphic ssrs
we first performed a validation experiment using tomato data from the scientific literature. tomato is a self-pollinating crop with very little genetic variation between cultivars  <cit> . forty-six of the  <dig> est-derived ssrs from he et al.  <cit>  were also present among the  <dig>  ssrs identified by polyssr in tomato . of these  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> were polymorphic and  <dig> monomorphic according to he et al.  <cit> . the same classification was obtained using polyssr for all  <dig> polymorphic, and for  <dig> of the  <dig> monomorphic ssrs.

we also selected some potato ssrs identified by polyssr for validation. potato is a tetraploid, cross-pollinating crop, with considerable allelic variation both within and between cultivars  <cit> . we randomly selected a set of  <dig> short polymorphic ssrs and  <dig> long polymorphic ssrs from the  <dig>  potato polymorphic ssrs, as identified by polyssr. in addition, a group of  <dig> ssrs, predicted to be monomorphic in the available est dataset, were selected from the  <dig>  putatively monomorphic ssrs. these include  <dig> short and  <dig> long monomorphic ssr . all  <dig> polymorphic and  <dig> monomorphic ssrs were also proposed by tigr  <cit> . primers for these ssrs were taken from the tigr database and evaluated using five potato cultivars including bintje, shepody and kennebec, that had contributed most of the est present in the database. almost all the potato ssrs identified as putatively polymorphic, were indeed polymorphic . in addition, most ssrs that represented monomorphic ssrs using the current est set turned out to be polymorphic. the results from short and long ssrs were similar.

effect of ssr length on frequency of polymorphism
we also studied the effect of the length of the ssrs on the frequency of polymorphism. for this the ssrs were divided in long and short . the frequency of polymorphic ssrs depended on the species and on the length of the ssr, ranging from as low as 6% for long ssrs in tomato up to 46% for short ssrs in potato . the frequency of polymorphic ssrs was higher for short ssrs than for long ssrs in all the species studied .

discussion
features of polyssr
polyssr has two features that are important advances on earlier est-ssr detecting software: 1) it is able to predict polymorphic ssrs, and 2) it is able to design high-quality primers for pcr amplification of polymorphic ssrs.

the first feature eliminates a lot of work by identifying and separating the many 'monomorphic' ssrs from the minority of polymorphic ones . although the frequency of identifying polymorphic est-ssrs depends on the species and the genotypes used for the evaluation, previous research indicates that a large proportion of est-ssr are not polymorphic  <cit> . as more est sequences become available, the more pronounced the power of polyssr will be to detect polymorphic ssrs.

the second feature takes into account a criterion that is important for the reliability of pcr amplification: the quality of flanking sequences  <cit> . this is of particular importance for est-ssrs, since est sequences are usually of poor quality, especially at the beginning and end of the sequence. also, it is important that flanking sequences are of sufficient length to reduce possible artifacts . polyssr uses at least  <dig> nucleotides on both sides of the ssr to filter out ssrs with low quality flanking sequences. furthermore, potential single nucleotide polymorphisms  identified by polyssr are taken into account when designing primers. this is accomplished by changing the snps in the consensus sequence of a contig into n's. primer <dig>  <cit>  excludes these positions as suitable positions for primers. primer sequences of potato ssrs, as provided by tigr do not take into account potential snps around the ssr. some of these primers are in regions where snps are present and therefore may produce unreliable amplicons in some genotypes. pcr primers that fail to anneal to the dna template will result in null-alleles, which are difficult to deal with in genetic experiments. it is also possible that a ssr predicted to be polymorphic becomes monomorphic because the primers amplify one allele only. using the improved strategy we were able to design reliable primers for more than 93% of the polymorphic ssr in arabidopsis, brassica, rice, potato, chicken and tomato .

consequences of using cap <dig> for clustering
the sequence assembly program cap <dig> used in this study generated more gene clusters and singletons than expected. for the model species rice, using 95% similarity for  <dig> nucleotides overlap of cap <dig>   <dig>  gene clusters were generated and  <dig>  ests were excluded from any cluster. even using the default setting ,  <dig>  clusters and  <dig>  singletons are produced. however, the total number of expressed genes of rice is estimated to be  <dig>  –  <dig>   <cit> . the rice gene index of tigr contains  <dig>  clusters and  <dig>  singletons that were created from  <dig> , <dig> sequences on june 20th  <dig>  the sequence assembling protocols used in tigr and in our study try to assemble sequences under the criterion that sequences should match end – to-end with a certain "identity". however, it is not uncommon that both ends of an est sequence are of poor quality. as a consequence of insufficient overlaps and/or poor quality overlaps, some sequences  from the same gene may not be assembled into the same cluster. this will result in overestimation of the number of clusters and singletons. similar situations were found during analysis of arabidopsis and apple ests  <cit> . as a consequence, this may result in an underestimation of the level of polymorphism in ssrs. in our study we found evidence for this. for example, in potato the polymorphic ssr st <dig> was also found in another polymorphic cluster . the same was found for the polymorphic ssr st <dig> and st <dig>  which were also present in the clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in addition a non-polymorphic ssr  was found polymorphic in cluster  <dig> . at present it is not clear whether this is caused by the redundancy between clusters or by the presence of paralogous genes. also feingold et al  <cit>  observed size variants of several ssrs that were not placed in the same clusters in the tigr potato ssr database. if this occurs it may cause repetitive validation of the same ssr or pcr amplification of paralogs. to prevent this, we developed a program called checkssr  to examine the presence of redundancy and paralogs in our ssr database. the program checks whether a particular ssr is unique. to accomplish this it compares primer sequence to the consensus sequence of each cluster and to all singleton sequences.

performance of polyssr
sixteen of the  <dig> polymorphic tomato ssrs identified by he et al.  <cit>  were also present in our database of polymorphic tomato est ssrs. the fact that this is only 50% may be caused by the limited number of est sequences available in the est database and by the limited number of genotypes contributing to the ests. of the monomorphic ssrs identified by he et al.  <cit>  only one of the  <dig> was found to be polymorphic in our data set; all others were indeed monomorphic. this single polymorphic microsatellite was derived from a genotype that was not used by he et al.  <cit> . the sequences containing the second allele of the ssr  were from genotype micro-tom, a tomato breed for experimental research rather than a commercial cultivar.

one of the  <dig> tested potato ssrs predicted to be polymorphic  showed no polymorphism in our set of cultivars. based on the est, it was expected to be polymorphic both within and between varieties kennebec, bintje and shepody , with a difference of  <dig> base pairs between the two alleles. a monomorphic fragment was obtained from kennebec and bintje, and no amplification products at all for shepody. careful examination of the cluster indicated that the observed  <dig> base pair difference in ssr length was compensated for by a  <dig> base pair insertion associated with the shortest variant of the ssr between one of the primers and the ssr, which resulted in fragments of equal length for all cultivars. an explanation for the non-amplification in shepody may be related to the relatively high variability of dna regions directly flanking the ssr. in such regions snps and short indels occur frequently  <cit> . the reverse primer that we used was located close to the ssr and perhaps targetting an indel.

of the  <dig> tested potato ssrs,  <dig> generated either no or no clear amplification products and  <dig> others produced amplicons larger than  <dig> base pairs . amplicons that are larger than predicted are likely to be the result of the presence of introns, while the presence of large introns can result in no amplification at all. in tetraploid and heterozygous potato cultivars, a maximum of  <dig> alleles per marker is expected  <cit> . when more alleles are found, this is most likely due to the amplification of paralogous sequences in addition to the target sequence. evidence for the latter was found for  <dig> tested markers that produced more than the expected maximum of  <dig> alleles in some genotypes .

from the  <dig> ssrs that produced clear patterns,  <dig> ssrs indeed showed the expected polymorphisms . compared to the highest reported success rate of est-ssrs in potato   <cit>  this is still a considerable improvement. the ssrs predicted to be monomorphic also resulted in the detection of a large number of polymorphic ssrs . this may be caused by the highly polymorphic nature of potato. alternatively, it may be caused by the fact that the monomorphic nature of these ssrs was based on a relatively small number of sequences , and/or a possible redundancy between clusters, as discussed above.

in some previous studies  <cit> , it was observed that est-ssrs had a lower level of polymorphism than genomic ssrs. our study demonstrates that a large number of polymorphic ssrs can be retrieved from est sequences, even in species that show low levels of polymorphism such as tomato .

analysis of ssrs obtained with polyssr
in general, ~5% of plant ests contain ssrs with a minimum repeat length of  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . in mammals this proportion varies from 2% in sheep to  <dig> % in mouse, while around  <dig> % and  <dig> % of chicken and zebra finch unique sequences contained ssrs  <cit> . in our results, 9%  to 28%  of the ests seem to contain ssrs. also more than 13% of the non-redundant ests contained ssrs , which is much higher than the published results. in rice non-redundant ests,  <dig>  ssrs were detected. this is much more than the  <dig>  ssrs found in the genomic sequence of rice subspecies japonica  <cit> , but is less than the number predicted by ssrprimer   <cit> . observed differences most likely result from the criteria used to identify ssrs, such as the minimum length of a ssr, whether or not only perfect repeats are considered, and whether or not mono-, penta and hexa nucleotide repeats are included  <cit> . in a previous study only di-, tri- and tetra- nucleotide perfect ssrs with at least  <dig> nucleotides were taken into account  <cit> .

some previous studies suggested that long ssrs are more frequently polymorphic  <cit> , or that more alleles and larger pic values should be expected  <cit>  for long ssrs compared to short ssrs. others observed no relationship between the repeat length and the informativeness of ssr  <cit> . using polyssr we have collected a large dataset with information on levels of polymorphism in several species that is ideally suited to address the controversy mentioned. our data show that short ssrs are more frequently polymorphic than long ssrs in all species investigated. an explanation may be the classification of long and short ssrs. in this and other studies, long and short ssrs are selected on the basis of the repeat length in available sequences. these sequences may be from short or long alleles of a ssr, for example, a short ssr may be the shorter version of a long ssr. however, it can not be excluded that the relative low frequency of polymorphism observed in the long ssrs is the result of the poor clustering by cap <dig>  the fact that short ssrs are more frequently polymorphic demonstrates that the previous focus on longer ssrs expected to be more polymorphic, may have been incorrect. as a consequence many ssrs may have been excluded from further analysis and overlooked as potentially useful markers.

ssr position in the expressed sequence
most di- and pentanucleotide repeats are found in utrs , which is similar to earlier publications  <cit> . most ssrs in coding regions are tri-nucleotide repeats, presumably because such ssrs do not cause frameshift mutations. we also studied the distribution of ssr polymorphisms across the ests and observed non-random patterns. in our study all species showed a higher ssr density in the 5' utr than in the 3' utr. this is similar to some published studies  <cit> , but not others  <cit> . ssr polymorphisms in coding regions or in 5'utrs may serve to modify expression or function of the genes with which they are associated. the number of repeats of ssrs in coding sequences may vary and thus providing a prolific source of quantitative and qualitative phenotypic variation  <cit> . another interesting finding of our study is that a number of polymorphic ssrs is present on the translation start and stop sites. this was the case for all species studied. such ssrs could have an impact on gene expression/translation and make it possible for the organism to adapt more easily to changing environmental conditions  <cit> .

prospects
the only prerequisite for polyssr is the availability of sufficient sequence information derived from different genotypes. it is especially in this area that that strong progress is likely to be made due to the introduction of new sequencing technologies  <cit> , such as the  <dig> sequencing  <cit> . with these new tools fast amount sequencing of data can be generated from any given species in a rapid and cheap way, which will further increase the applicability of polyssr. when  <dig> sequencing is carried out on cdna derived from different genotypes, polyssr can directly process the data, which are only a bit shorter than from traditionally sequenced ests.

especially in agricultural crops were not so much activity is ongoing, new sequencing technologies in combination with polyssr will revolutionarise ssr marker development. it is also anticipated that with the going down of prizes for sequencing, the technology will become affordable as well for ecological studies, where ssr markers are widely used for population analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
the value of polyssr is demonstrated by the fact that almost all tested ssrs predicted to be polymorphic were indeed validated as polymorphic. large numbers of polymorphic ssrs were identified by polyssr from publicly available est sequences of potato, tomato, rice, arabidopsis, brassica and chicken. these results clearly demonstrate that ests are a valuable resource for developing polymorphic microsatellites. polyssr supplies reliable polymorphic ssrs and high quality ssr primers, thereby decreasing the cost for designing and testing primers. in addition, polyssr brings a novel approach employing the redundancy and heterozygosity of ests to develop markers based on ssrs that have been ignored in the past. in the polyssr pipeline a primer design module is included that designs primers for amplification of the ssr taking into account the length of flanking sequences available and potential snps surrounding the ssrs. polyssr has a broad applicability in non-model species when combined with the next generation of sequencing technologies.

the large number of ssrs detected with polyssr allows a more in-depth investigation of general properties of ssrs. we show that short ssrs are more often polymorphic than long ssrs. in addition to identification of polymorphic ssrs and primer design, we used polyssr to create a database of polymorphic ssrs. this database is available from the website  <cit> .
