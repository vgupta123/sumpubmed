BACKGROUND
understanding the behavior of bacterial growth parameters  under various environmental conditions is of some interest  <cit> . in particular, knowledge about growth parameter population distributions is needed in order to make better predictions about the growth of pathogens and spoilage organisms in food  <cit> . in fact, probability-based methods, such as microbial risk assessment  <cit> , have to take into account the distribution of kinetic parameters in a population of cells  <cit> . there is a paucity of growth parameter distribution data because of the large number of data points required to obtain such results. the utilization of traditional microbiological enumeration methods  for such a body of work is daunting. for this reason various methods have been developed which enable more rapid observations related to one, or more, growth parameters. recently, growth parameter distribution characterization has mainly focused on the duration of lag phase  <cit> . for instance, guillier and co-workers studied the effects of various stress factors  on individual cell-based detection times in listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . additionally, reporting on improved methods, various workers  <cit>  have presented frequency distribution information concerning lag phase duration of individual bacterial cells  on solid media. however, similar population-based information on specific growth rate is lacking.

the findings presented herein developed from work associated with the attachment of various gram-negative bacteria to anti-salmonella and anti-e. coli o <dig> immunomagnetic beads or imbs  <cit> . for these imb investigations microplate  mpn methods were utilized because of the low limits of bacterial detection  <cit>  necessary to characterize the non-specific attachment of background food organisms to various capture surfaces. because of large inter-bacterial strain variability in the time requisite to reach a measurable level of turbidity, we found it necessary to characterize the growth rate and apparent lag time   <cit>  of certain problematic organisms. toward this end we began a routine investigation into the best microplate reader method to determine doubling time . however, while performing this work we noticed that our test organism, a native e. coli isolate which non-specifically adheres to certain imbs  <cit> , seemed to display very uniform τ values only up to a certain threshold initial or starting cell density  beyond which we observed an obvious increase in the scatter. a larger number of observations were then made after various physiological perturbations  which have lead to the results discussed in this report.

RESULTS
doubling times from both tapc and microplate observations
the agreement between the e. coli τ from tapc and microplate methods was somewhat unexpected inasmuch as solution agitation  of the media in each plate's wells would be less than that for solution agitation in either normal or baffled flasks which were used for the tapc comparisons. however, we found  that  levels in even highly agitated liquid e. coli cultures at 37°c dropped as much as 72%  with  <dig> rpm shaking while they were consuming approximately {4-6} × 10- <dig> moles o <dig> sec- <dig> cfu- <dig> . even the baffled flask culture showed a drop in  of 40-57%. simultaneously, no cultures  showed any perturbations in τ ; the  <dig> min τ seen with bubbling is probably greater due to evaporative cooling of the medium. due to differences in both solution mixing and surface area-to-volume ratio, the  levels in microplate wells must be even lower than flask cultures at equivalent cell densities. fig.  <dig> demonstrates that even at the lowest , the rates of growth were unaffected. clearly, being a facultative anaerobe, e. coli is able to rapidly adjust to different levels of o <dig> with no apparent change in its specific growth rate, although the maximum cell density in stationary phase is usually greater in highly oxygenated samples by up to an order of magnitude.

effect of initial or starting cfu concentration on τ
while performing studies related to comparing various assays for determining growth rate , we noticed that our test organism, a nonpathogenic avian e. coli isolate, seemed to display uniform od-based τ values up to a threshold ci, at which point there was an obvious increase in the observed τ scatter . the main graph in fig.  <dig> represents  <dig> measurements of τ derived from od data using eq.  <dig>  plotted as a function of ci . when ci > ca.  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  τ was narrowly gaussian-distributed  with a total spread of ca.  <dig> to  <dig> min . however, when ci < ca.  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> there was a clear broadening in the range of observed τ values . at such low concentrations the cfus per well should vary between  <dig> and  <dig> whereupon 44% of the wells should have  <dig>  cfu per well, 14% with  <dig>  cfus per well, 8% with  <dig>  per well, 6% with  <dig>  per well, and 3% with between  <dig>  and <dig>  cfus per well . the inset graph in fig.  <dig> shows frequency of occurrence for all values of τ, which occur in the region of greatest scatter , with the best fit bimodal gaussian distribution  represented by the solid, black curve. the least squares bimodal distribution curve fit contains a narrow component  similar to the high cell concentration-associated unimodal distribution. based upon area, there was also a nearly equivalent broad component . each constituent of this bimodal distribution is shown as a solid, grey curve.

a similar increase in another growth parameter's scatter was also observed with the tmdata at low ci  whereupon we saw that tm values changed in a predictable way  up to ci ~  <dig> -  <dig>  cfu ml- <dig> at which point they began to show an obvious large deviation in tm . these perturbations in tm at low ci confirm the τ observations because tm is modulated, at least in part, by τ  and therefore large deviations in τ  should result in increased scatter in tm as well. working with stressed listeria monocytogenes, guillier and coworkers  <cit>  observed numerous values of a lag time-related growth parameter with a similar asymmetric distribution pattern. measuring the time of the first cell division in e. coli using a microscopic method, which should provide the true value of lag time, niven and co-workers  <cit>  were ableto make numerous observations  which showed a very broad  asymmetric distribution. asymmetry might be interpreted as weakly bimodal. other workers  <cit>  using a different method of observation showed that the distribution of individual times to the first cell division varied greatly based on salt concentration. in fact, at high salt concentrations, the distribution pattern appeared distinctly bimodal. however, in earlier work  <cit> , such asymmetric population distributions were interpreted as being gamma-distributed.

the experiments represented in fig.  <dig> were repeated using mid-log phase-associated cells as described in the experimental section and we saw qualitatively similar results . the main graph in fig.  <dig> represents  <dig> od observations with the calculated values of τ plotted as a function of ci. at cis > ca.  <dig>  cfu ml- <dig> the average τ was unimodally-distributed with a maximum spread of ca.  <dig> to  <dig> min . similar to the stationary phase-based cells, we see that as ci was decreased , a striking increase occurred in the scatter of τ . the frequency of occurrence of all log phase-based τ values  are displayed in the inset graph of fig.  <dig> .

it is important to keep in mind throughout this work that by the time we begin to observe an increase in od , somewhere between  <dig> and  <dig> doublings will have occurred. this fact implies that the values we observe are somehow modulated based upon initial conditions. it should also be noted that low bacterial cis  would result in at least some single cfu occurrences per well  at which point the first few events of cell division could modulate characteristics of both τ and true microbiological lag time . thus, some of the increase in τ and t scatter we observe at low ci could result from the random selection of isolates with particularly slow growth rates which would otherwise be masked by other isolates in the media with faster rates. however, arguing against such a stochastically-based explanation is the fact that a significant fraction of the scatter in τ  occurs between ci = 10- <dig> cfu ml- <dig> whereupon the probability of observing  <dig> cfu per well only ranges from  <dig>  to ca. 0%. under these conditions the random selection of one particular τ-component would be overwhelmed by the sheer number of other cells present. at slightly higher concentrations , any well which has  <dig> or  <dig> cells with τ values differing more than about  <dig> or  <dig> min would be obvious in the ∂od/∂t curves as additional peaks. nevertheless, we just don't observe such behavior at these low cis. what we do observe are relatively uniform, monotypic growth curves  indicative of one component . the fact that we see much greater τ-based scatter at a relatively large threshold ci argues that there is some other controlling factor in determining such binomial-based population growth rates.

in order to determine if the apparent ci effect on τ was only associated with our native e. coli strain, we tested two other bacterial strains . table  <dig> summarizes τ frequency distribution parameters  from the experiments represented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> as well as results concerning mid-log phase e. coli o157:h <dig> and citrobacter in lb, e. coli in mm or lb with  <dig> mm ethyl acetate . the stationary or log phase-based generic e. coli or e. coli o157:h <dig> growth data in lb gave similar results: for the narrower portion of the bimodal gaussian distribution, the population mean τ values  varied only  <dig>  to  <dig>  min ; the broader part of the distribution was also very similar . utilizing mm rather than lb with generic e. coli cells from log phase cultures, we saw that the τ distribution on initial cell concentration remained as apparent as the phenomenon in lb , which is consistent with other work . the gram negative bacterium citrobacter , which was also grown in lb with cells from log phase cultures, had relatively large doubling times but displayed a clear bimodal distribution in τ at low cell densities  similar to previous observations. however, the ethyl acetate set of experiments  with e. coli, which were performed as a positive control for testing various n-acyl homoserine lactones , showed that ea nearly collapsed the bimodal distribution  to a unimodal form as a result. we observed that α dropped to  <dig>  from an lb average of  <dig>  , μτ <dig> shifted upward  <dig>  min, and στ <dig> broadened by  <dig>  min. this result argues for a physiological basis for the increased τ scatter at ci below  <dig>  to  <dig>   cfu ml- <dig>  because of the relatively large effect of solvent alone, the ahl experiments were not performed.

since there was an obvious dependence of τ on ci, we were interested in determining if the bimodal effect could be reversed by growth in sterile-filtered lb media, which formerly contained the same bacterial isolate , thus testing to see if an extracellular molecule modulated the bimodal distribution effect . in one set of experiments  the lb diluent was made as follows: 37°c lb was inoculated with stationary phase e. coli cells and grown several hrs at 37°c  followed by sterile filtering  after centrifugation. these observations are plotted adjacent to control data  in fig.  <dig>  a second  experiment was also performed , with the results shown in table  <dig>  both experiments showed that there was a shift in the low ci bimodal populations  but the bimodal effect was still apparent. the treatments depicted in fig.  <dig> also clearly conceptualize the line broadening of the narrow distribution component, the relative decrease in α in the bimodal population, as well as the shift of the two bimodal components towards each other. thus, some component exists in the media which somewhat modulates the growth process. lastly, when approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> sonicated/heat-killed cells ml- <dig> in fresh lb were utilized as the diluent but with the starting innocula taken from a log phase culture, the effect was to induce the narrow component's average τ to shift to that of the broad component . fig. 7b shows τ data plotted as a function of ci and clearly shows the initial concentration effect of τ scatter below  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  these results also argue for a physiological basis for the increased τ scatter at relatively low ci .

CONCLUSIONS
working with a native, food-borne e. coli isolate grown in either lb or mm, we found that microplate-based doubling times were bimodally distributed at low cell densities using either log or stationary phase cells as an initial inoculum. qualitatively identical results were obtained for an e. coli o157:h <dig> and citrobacter strain. when sterile-filtered 'conditioned' lb media  were employed as a diluent, there were apparent shifts in the two  populations but the bimodal effect was still evident. however, the bimodal response was almost completely reversed when the growth media contained a small amount of ethyl acetate.

the clear doubling time-cell concentration dependency shown in these results might indicate that bacteria exude a labile biochemical which controls τ, or a need for cell-to-cell physical contact. the latter proposal seems unlikely inasmuch as the probability of random contact would be small at such low cell densities . perhaps this anomalous bimodal distribution of doubling times is related to the recently proposed phenotypic switching  <cit>  which describes programmed variability in certain bacterial populations.
