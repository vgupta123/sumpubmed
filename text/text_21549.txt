BACKGROUND
chrysanthemum  is an important ornamental plants with high economic value all around the world  <cit> . it is susceptible to the aphid  infestation from vegetative to flowering stage. m. sanbourni not only hampers the vegetative growth, but also decreases the quality of flowers, which causes serious loss in chrysanthemum production. besides draining plants’ nutrients, aphids also transmit pathogenic viruses. the progress has been made in our understanding of plant-aphid interaction, especially the molecular bases of plant resistance and defense against aphid feeding. several plant r  genes related with plant resistance to aphids have been identified. for example, mi- <dig>  gene confers resistance to the potato aphid  in wild tomato, lycopersicon peruvianum  p. mill.  <cit> . and vat  gene mediates resistance to the cotton aphid  as well as some viruses transmitted by this aphid in melon, cucumis melo l.  <cit> . both mi- <dig>  and vat gene belong to the nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich-repeat  family of plant r gene, and there is close linkage between resistance loci and nbs-lrr gene sequences revealed by genetic analysis  <cit> . however, detailed mechanisms of r genes involved in aphid resistance still need further investigation.

during aphid infestation, series of plant defense responses, including plant hormone signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and the expression of defensive genes, would be induced  <cit> . salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene  are three better studied phytohormones involved in aphid-induced plant hormone signal transduction. in interactions between myzus persicae and arabidopsis thaliana, sa signaling pathway is activated and the expression of genes such as pathogenesis-related  genes  associated with the signaling pathway increased  <cit> . and a wide range of defensive responses in arabidopsis thaliana attacked by cabbage aphid  depended on sa signaling  <cit> . furthermore, recent studies found that sa signaling pathway was critical for mi- <dig> -mediated resistance to aphid  <cit> . the ja pathway, containing wound hormone ja-ile, is also an important regulator of plant resistance to herbivores. kusnierczyk et al.
 <cit>  indicated that many of defense-associated responses induced by cabbage aphid  in wild-type  plants were impaired in arabidopsis lacking jasmonates. ja promoted the synthesis of glucosinolate and nδ-acetyl ornithine in arabidopsis, thereby improving the resistance to aphid  <cit> . the resistance of alfalfa to blue green aphid  and defense of arabidopsis on cabbage aphid are all dependent on the ja signaling cascades  <cit> . argandona and co-workers  <cit>  observed that aphid feeding significantly induced the production of et in the leaf tissue of aphid-resistant barley cultivars contrasted to susceptible ones. et excited by green peach aphid infestation induced the expression of atmyb <dig>  which then bound to the promoter of ethylene insensitive <dig> , regulating the defense responses in arabidopsis
 <cit> . ja and et often act synergistically, and are frequently antagonized by sa  <cit> . ein <dig> is a bifunctional transducer of et and ja signal transduction  <cit> . still, knowledge about members of the ein <dig> downstream defense pathway is limited.

the development of high-throughput technologies allows us a global view of gene expression changes during plant interactions with aphids. moran et al.
 <cit>  suggested that genes associated with signaling, pathogenesis-related responses, oxidative stress and calcium-dependent signaling are crucial components of the aphid response profile in a. thaliana. transcriptome and metabolome changes of arabidopsis were investigated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after b. brassicae infestation to monitor the progress of early response by full-genome oligonucleotide microarrays, revealing reactive oxygen species  and calcium is involved in early signaling, ja and sa in the regulation of defense responses, and the induction of transcripts associated with senescence, biosynthesis of indolyl glucosinolates , anti-insect proteins, camalexin, and several wrky transcription factors were identified as well  <cit> . kusnierczyk and co-workers  <cit>  conducted an extensive analysis of transcriptional patterns of wt, aos defective in ja production, and fou <dig> constitutively inducing ja biosynthesis in arabidopsis. more than  <dig> genes whose expression were dependent on jasmonate levels and over  <dig> genes that differentially responded to aphid feeding in aos and fou <dig> plants than in wt were identified through microarray. they also demonstrated activation of defense caused by ja, such as wrky, ethylene responsive transcription factors , btb and taz domain protein  <dig> , pathogenesis related proteins pr <dig> and pr <dig>  and plant defensines . numerous key genes and proteins were unravelled in researches of gene transcriptional responses in model plants, such as a. thaliana, medicago truncatula, nicotiana attenuata and sorghum bicolor. however, the exact mechanisms and functions of most of them are still unclear.

previous studies on chrysanthemum found that superoxide dismutase , peroxidase , ascorbate peroxidase , polyphenol oxidase  activity and phenylalanine ammonia lyase  activities were enhanced by aphid herbivory, and changes in the enzymes activities in resistant species were faster than those in susceptible ones  <cit> . sa and meja pretreatment improved the resistance of chrysanthemum against aphids and increased the content of ros species, defensive substances, flavonoids and lignins , which implied that multiple pathways should be involved in the response of chrysanthemum to the aphid infestation. therefore, to make a comprehensive view of differentially expressed genes  during chrysanthemum-macrosiphoniella sanbourni interaction, an experiment exploring comparative expression profiling was conducted. we also conduct a mock puncture treatment which is designed to partially simulate the mechanical stress resulting from aphid penetration, attempting to figure out the potential impacts of aphid stylets. this work would lay a foundation for further study in the resistance of chrysanthemum to aphid.

RESULTS
an overview of three libraries data sets by rna-seq
three libraries were generated from pooled leaf tissues of chrysanthemum morifolium ‘nannongxunzhang’ that were collected at different time points with  or without  aphid infestations and mock puncture treatment , and sequenced using an illumina hiseqtm  <dig> platform. after removing reads containing adaptor sequence and with low-quality, a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained, in library ck, y and z, respectively, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  . the proportion of clean reads was > <dig> % in each library . and these clean reads were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database  under accession number srp <dig> table  <dig>

a reference gene database including all known chrysanthemum morifolium unigene sequences was applied to map the clean reads. according to the chosen criteria, an average of  <dig> % of the clean reads were mapped , which consisted of perfect match and < =2 bp mismatch. regarding each library, the scales of clean reads uniquely mapped to the database were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. there were still approximately  <dig> % of clean reads that cannot be mapped, mainly due to the restriction of the reference gene database of chrysanthemum. the number of genes identified increased with the number of reads until above  <dig> , <dig>  implying saturation of sequencing . the unigene coverage analysed as a means of evaluating the quality of the rna-seq data was mostly >50% .figure  <dig>

discussion
rna sequencing technology allows us to have a comprehensive view on the gene expression changes induced by aphids. and there are numerous genes whose expressions are changed after aphid feeding. here, we mainly focus on the discussion on genes related to phytohormone signaling pathways and aphid feeding-associated transcription factors , photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species , cell wall biosynthesis and nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich-repeat  genes.

plant hormone signaling pathway involved in plant-aphid interaction
salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene  are three major phytohormones reported in the regulation of signaling networks involved in aphid-induced defense responses. sa is important for localized plant tissue hypersensitive responses , and could activate systemic acquired resistance , which is a broad-spectrum resistance of plants and it is necessary to transduce sa signal to stimulate the transcription of defense response genes, such as pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> . non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes <dig> , also called non-inducible immunity <dig> , is a key factor of sar, and activates the expression of pr genes upon binding to tgas, transcription factors which bind to sa-responsive elements  in the promoters of pr genes  <cit> . besides its regulatory role in pr gene expression, npr <dig> also participates in the inhibition of ja signaling by sa  <cit> . in the present study, three npr <dig> genes  and two tga genes  were up-regulated by aphid infestation in the ck and y comparison  . two npr <dig> genes  was induced by mock puncture treatment in the ck and z comparison  , implying that unigene16290_all might respond specifically to aphid feeding. in arabidopsis thaliana, npr <dig> and nim <dig> mutant plants are deficient in sa-induced disease resistance  <cit> . further study suggests that the cytosolic function of npr <dig> plays a role in sa-ja antagonism, and the nuclear function of npr <dig> plays a role in the induction of sa-responsive genes  <cit> .

the ja signaling transduction, containing wound hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine , is another well studied regulator of plant resistance to aphids  <cit> . genes involved in ja synthesis  <cit> , such as phospholipase, lipoxygenase , allene oxide synthase , allene oxide cyclase  and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase  were all stimulated after aphid infestation and mock puncture treatment in the ck-vs-y and ck-vs-z . several previous studies have indicated the roles of ja in aphid infestation responses, for example, lox genes were strongly up-regulated by myzus persicae feeding on a. thaliana leaves  <cit> , m. nicotianae feeding on nicotiana attenuata leaves  <cit> , and m. euphorbiae on tomato leaf tissues  <cit> . infestation of potato  by m. persicae induced transcripts encoding pr- <dig>  which increased gradually during the time-course of aphid feeding, and the expression of jaz <dig> was kept at a stable level  <cit> . in present study, three jaz  and five myc <dig> genes  were significantly differentially expressed in ck-vs-y . there were four differentially expressed jaz  and four myc <dig> genes  in ck-vs-z , indicating that unigene3689_all might be related with the ja signaling pathway and play a major role in wound-induced response by aphid infestation. jasmonate zim-domain proteins  identified as key players of ja signaling cascade repress expression of ja-responsive genes by binding to transcriptional factors, such as myc <dig>  <cit> . plants increase the synthesis of ja which is then transformed to ja-ile by jasmonic acid resistant  <dig>  enzyme under stress  <cit> . the ja-ile conjugate promotes interaction between jaz and coi <dig> proteins in skp/cullin/f-box complex , resulting the degradation of jaz through scfcoi1-dependent 26s proteasome pathway and the removal of inhibition to myc <dig>  thereby starting the transcription of ja-responsive genes, such as vegetative storage protein  gene . how the jaz and myc <dig> regulate the response of chrysanthemum to aphid infestation is to be studied further.

though relatively few studies have been reported on the participation of et in plant-aphid interactions, some studies have suggested that aphid infestation markedly increased the production of et in leaves of plants, including barley  <cit> , celery  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . unigene10068_all, unigene38824_all and unigene1735_all encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthases, the key enzymes in et biosynthesis, were up-expressed in the ck-vs-y . ethylene insensitive <dig> , a membrane protein, plays an essential role in et signaling pathway and is indispensable for defense responses. for instance, the ein <dig> gene is demanded for the induced resistance to m. persicae in arabidopsis treated by hrpnea
 <cit> . besides, et signaling pathway through ein <dig> results in transcription of the plant defensin gene pdf <dig> , a molecular marker of et signal transduction and needs ein <dig> for transcription  <cit> . et often works synergistically with ja  <cit> . recent study shows that the et-stabilized transcriptional factors  mediate several et transcriptional responses that are regulated by crosstalk with ja, which enhances the activity of ein3/eil <dig> by removal of jaz proteins repressing ein3/eil <dig>  <cit> . however, there is no ein <dig>  pdf <dig>  or ein3/eil <dig> gene significantly differentially expressed in both ck-vs-y and ck-vs-z comparison, which may be related with the insensitivity of chrysanthemum to ethylene  <cit> , therefore, we suggested that the insensitivity of chrysanthemum to et might partially compromise et cascade or et-mediated aphid infestation response in chrysanthemum in a different way from that in other plants.

besides the sa-ja-et backbone, other plant hormones, such as abscisic acid , auxin and gibberellin , have gotten less attention as potential factors that mediate aphid resistance. however, these hormones also play a significant role in herbivore-induced defense responses, feeding into the sa-ja-et network. aba synthesis and cascades affect herbivore-activated ja metabolism and signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . synergy between aba and ja could stimulate myc-dependent gene expression  <cit> , and myc <dig> functions as an integration point between the aba and ja pathways  <cit> . auxin and ja co-regulate jaz <dig> and myc <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, gibberellic acid  affect the ja signaling pathway through competitively binding to jaz proteins instead of dellas, negative regulators of gb signaling, thereby promoting myc2-induced gene expression  <cit> . ga perception results in degradation of dellas, leading to the inhibition of myc <dig> and attenuated ja responses. the expression of five della genes  was modulated by aphid infestation in ck-vs-y  and one gene  by mock puncture experiment in ck and z , indicating the complex connections between different plant hormone signalings induced by aphid in chrysanthemum leaf.

transcription factors  responding to aphid infestation
tfs are important regulators of plants’ defense response. several members of tf families have been reported to be involved in plant-herbivore interaction. overexpression of oswrky <dig> increased the resistance of rice to white-backed planthopper, sogatella furcifera, a sap-sucking insect  <cit> . in nicotiana attenuata, silencing wrky <dig> and/or wrky <dig> makes plants more susceptible to insect herbivory, and this susceptibility is connected with the impairment of ja accumulation and defenses mediated by ja signaling  <cit> , suggesting the crosstalk between tfs and phytohormone signaling. silencing and overexpression of oserf <dig> indicate that the gene is a central early herbivore-responsive one that affects a set of defense-associated signaling pathways, such as mapk cascades as well as sa, ja and et signaling, and it acts as a vital switch modulating defense responses against chewing and piercing/sucking insects in rice  <cit> . the aphid-susceptible atmyb <dig> mutant showed a much greater susceptibility to aphid feeding and most compromised in induced resistance in arabidopsis. a further stud shows that atmyb <dig> incurred an abolishment of the induction of ein <dig>  indicating a close link between atmyb <dig> and ein2
 <cit> . besides their direct functions in plant-aphid interaction, tfs may also regulate the growth and development of plants to mediate defense responses indirectly, including photosynthesis, cell wall formation, carbon metabolism and so on. in present study, we also identified several differentially expressed tfs that were reported previously, including wrky, myb and ap2/erf, and some new tfs responding to aphid herbivory in chrysanthemum, such as gras and hsf genes . in the ck-vs-y, twelve wrky, seven myb, six ap2/erf, four gras and three hsf genes were recognized, whereas only two wrky genes, two myb genes, three ap2/erf genes, one gras genes and one hsf genes were identified in the ck-vs-z, implying that aphid feeding has bigger influences on gene expression and is more complicated than mock puncture treatment, and the new discovered aphid-responsive tfs, gras  and hsf genes , might express specifically to aphid infestation. still, the potential roles of these tfs need further investigation.

reactive oxygen species  and antioxidant genes
besides being toxic byproducts of metabolism, ros, for example hydrogen peroxide , are also involved in the complex signaling network of plants  <cit> . there are at least three possible roles for ros in plant-aphid interaction: direct adverse influences on aphid midgut tissues  <cit> , triggering programmed cell death   <cit>  leading to apoptosis to against biotrophic aphids and stimulating defense signaling pathways towards aphid attack  <cit> . aphid feeding alters plant redox state and induces the production of ros  <cit> , and others could also elicit the accumulation of ros content, such as sa and ja, indicating possible interactions between ros signaling and phytohormone transduction. research of russian wheat aphid  <cit> , diuraphis noxia  infestation on wheat  resulted in induction of h2o <dig> content and activity of nadph oxidase from which ros are largely derived  <cit> , and strongly indicated a probable signaling role for h2o <dig>  here, three nadph oxidase genes, unigene45792_all, unigene300_all and unigene3581_all, were recognized in ck and y comparison alone . furthermore, enzymes, such as peroxidase , ascorbate peroxidase  and polyphenol oxidase , involved in ros scavenging were also up-regulated during aphid infestation , suggesting the maintenance of redox homeostasis is important for responses to aphid, which are consistent with our previous observation of the enhanced enzyme activities by aphid infestation. except linked with detoxification of ros, enzymes, such as peroxidases, are yet prerequisites for plant cell wall building  <cit> , further demonstrating the complex regulatory network inside plants.

photosynthesis-associated genes involved in response to aphid feeding
aphids, phloem-feeding herbivores, drain plant nutrients of which the main components are saccharides resulting from photosynthesis. saccharides drained from the sieve element are easy to be contaminated by bacteria on the surface of leaves, thereby affecting photosynthesis. in our study, only two photosynthesis-related genes  were detected in the ck and y alone , both of them belonging to the components of photosystem were induced by aphids, which may suggest the strengthening of photosynthesis, compensating for the loss of nutrients and maintaining the normal growth processes. d. noxia feeding on leaves of wheat  <cit> , m. persicae feeding on celery foliage  <cit>  and m. nicotianae feeding on n. attenuata leaves tissues  <cit>  promote the expression of photosynthesis genes, while some of them are decreased by m. nicotianae
 <cit>  or schizaphis graminum
 <cit> , possibly reflecting the redistribution of metabolites from normal growth functions to defensive roles after aphids feeding in plants.

nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat  genes
two cloned aphid resistance  genes, mi- <dig> , conferring resistance to the potato aphid, macrosiphum euphorbiae   <cit> , and vat, mediating resistance to the cotton aphid, aphis gossypii glover  <cit> , belong to nbs-lrr family. similarly, other plant-aphid interactions have revealed a tight relationship between nbs-lrr genes and resistance loci. plants of wheat having d. noxia resistance gene contain leucine zipper -nbs-lrr sequences . swanepoel and co-workers  <cit>  also discovered tight connection between lz-nbs-lrr sequence and d. noxia resistance gene. on the chromosome of medicago truncatula, a locus which controls the resistance to the blue alfalfa aphid, acyrthosiphon kondoi, is flanked by coiled-coil -nbs-lrr sequence  <cit> . similarly, we found two differentially expressed genes  containing nbs-lrr region in ck-vs-y . further cloning and functional identification regarding the two genes would be necessary.

genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis
in arabidopsis, several cobra and cobra-like genes have been identified to be important for secondary cell wall development  <cit> . loss of function mutation of these genes results in brittle stalks and decreased cellulose content  <cit> , indicating that these genes are essential for normal cellulose deposition in secondary cell wall. mutations in brittle culm <dig>  which encodes a cobra-like protein suggest that it controls the mechanical strength of monocots and is an important player in the biosynthesis of cell walls of mechanical tissues  <cit> . there are three cobra-like genes  identified in ck-vs-y, and two  out of three in ck-vs-z . hemicelluloses and pectins, which are both synthesized in the golgi, and cellulose and callose, both synthesized at plasma membrane, are the major polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. the identification of cellulose synthase a , which is the catalytic subunit of the cellulose synthase complex  <cit> , greatly enriches our understanding of the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides. and some cellulose synthase-like  genes have also been reported to be responsible for the biosynthesis of glycan backbones in the golgi  <cit> . in this study, two  and three csl genes  were detected in the ck-vs-y and ck-vs-z, respectively . the up-regulation of cobra-like and csl genes suggests that the mechanical strength of the plant are somewhat strengthened, which might therefore hinder the puncturing of the aphid stylet during aphid feeding. therefore, the detailed mechanisms of these genes during plant-aphid interactions could be another interesting topic, and relevant transgenic work would be more practical.

secondary metabolites
secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, terpenes, phenolics and alkaloids, having antixenotic or antibiotic properties, could function in plant defense against herbivores  <cit> . in vigna
 <cit> , there is a positive relationship between resistance or susceptibility properties against aphids and flavonoid glycoside content. the content of flavonoid in susceptible lines was lower than in resistant ones. in vitro bioassays proved that quercetin and isorhamnetin, members of endogenous flavonoids, have a significant inhibitory on the reproduction rate of aphids. in contrast, overexpression of atmyb <dig>  resulting in increasing flavonol levels, did enhance the resistance to caterpillars, but with no effects on the performance of b. brassicae
 <cit> . flavonoids, including flavones and isoflavones  <cit> , are derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is catalyzed by a number of enzymes, for example, pal , which is well studied for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. in this study, we got several degs related with flavonoids synthesis, such as pal, in both ck-vs-y and ck-vs-z . attacked by herbivores, some plants would emit volatile compounds, which are mainly mono- and sesquiterpenes, used by parasitic wasps to find their hosts, the lepidopteran larvae. terpene synthases catalyze the committed step in the biosynthesis of varieties of mono- and sesquiterpene products from prenyl diphosphate precursors. the expression of terpene synthase  <dig>  in the maize cv b <dig> was stimulated by herbivory and mechanical damage. further analysis shows that the transcription of tps <dig> or its homolog varies between different cultivars of maize  <cit> . our previous study found that the increased content of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids in the leaves of the hybrid between chrysanthemum and artemisia vulgaris enhanced plant resistance to aphid  <cit> . interestingly, two terpene synthase encoding genes  were detected in ck-vs-y and ck-vs-z, respectively . these discussed above illustrate the involvement of secondary metabolites during aphid herbivory in chrysanthemum leaf, indicating their potential roles in the defense responses against aphids.

aphid feeding and mock puncture treatment
here, in our research, we conducted a mock puncture treatment trying to partially simulate the mechanical stress resulting from aphid penetration. despite there are some differences between aphid stylet and puncture. for instance, aphid stylets were often wrapped by saliva which contains a complex mixture of enzymes and can induce defense responses  <cit> . also, the mechanical degree of puncture treatment should be different from aphid stylets. results that were discussed above show that it does have some similarities between aphid feeding and puncture treatment, such as genes involved in phytohormone metabolism and signaling pathway, ros scavenging and cell wall biosynthesis, and some genes specifically expressed in response to aphid treatment, for example, nbs-lrr genes. and as shown in figure 4b,  <dig> degs were specifically expressed in ck-vs-y;  <dig> degs were co-expressed in ck-vs-y and ck-vs-z, suggesting that genes co-expressed in response to aphid feeding and puncture treatment might be involved in wound-induced response by aphid, otherwise genes may specifically respond to aphid sucking. these will allow us to figure out the potential impacts of aphid stylets and refine the processes of defense responses.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these examples indicate that aphid feeding does have a global effect on gene expression in chrysanthemum leaf, including genes involved in phytohormone signaling, cell wall biosynthesis, photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species  pathway and transcription factors , and so on. usually, there are cross-communications between different defense pathways those genes belonging to, which provide an ability that allows plants to integrate environmental, developmental and defense-related signals, fine-tuning its defense responses.
