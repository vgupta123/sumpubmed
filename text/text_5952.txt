BACKGROUND
asian rice  is one of the most important food crops for mankind and is considered to be a model system for molecular genetic research in monocots, due to its small genome size and its synteny with other cereal crops  <cit> . recent advances in large-scale genomic research has provided extremely useful tools, such as a complete, high-quality genome sequence  <cit> , bacterial artificial chromosome libraries  <cit> , insertional mutant collections  <cit> , and the discovery of new molecular markers  <cit> . plant breeders and geneticists have taken advantage of these advances by using both cultivated and wild germplasm as new sources of genetic variation to facilitate identification of genes and qtls of economic importance, contributing to an increased rice production.

although methodologies for mapping genes or qtls underlying quantitative traits have made considerable progress, the need to develop new population types to facilitate the study of alleles from wild species, has been pointed out. these materials would allow identification and use of new sources of allelic variation that have not been sufficiently exploited yet  <cit> . different types of segregating populations, like recombinant inbred lines , doubled haploids , backcross  or f2/f <dig> populations have been extensively used for qtl mapping. nevertheless, these populations do not have sufficient power in detecting qtls with minor effects, at least when standard population sizes of a few hundreds of segregating individuals are used  <cit> . moreover, in the case of interspecific crosses, hybrid sterility often hampers developing such population types. to circumvent these issues, researchers have developed novel population types, which are all very similar in essence: introgression lines  in tomato  <cit> brassica napus  <cit>  and brassica oleracea  <cit> , stepped aligned inbred recombinant strains  in arabidopsis  <cit> , recombinant chromosome substitution lines  in barley  <cit> , introgression libraries in rye  <cit> , chromosome segment substitution lines  or single segment substitution lines  in rice  <cit> . in these populations, which all belong to the generic introgression lines family, the iterative backcrossing process often makes it possible to recover a partial or complete fertility of the progeny.

libraries of introgression lines are produced by successive backcrossing  to the recurrent parent. the introgressed fragments can be monitored using molecular markers, either in each generation or at chosen stages. fixation of the materials is obtained by either selfing or using the double-haploid methodology . as a result, each line possesses one or few homozygous chromosomal fragments of the donor genotype, introgressed into a recurrent background genome. these fragments should be arranged contiguously from the first to the last chromosome, either manually or using a computer software-aided process . the whole donor genome is thus represented by a set of small, contiguous overlapping fragments.

the objective of this paper is to describe the development and selection of a cssl library derived from an interspecific cross between o. sativa l. and o. glaberrima steud., the cultivated african rice species. in order to illustrate the usefulness of this resource for genetic analyses and breeding purposes, we present a qtl detection analysis for grain yield, yield components and resistance to rice stripe necrosis virus .

RESULTS
description of the cssl population
the cssl finder program selected a subset of  <dig> ssr markers properly distributed across the twelve rice chromosomes. on this basis, searching for cssl candidates led to a set of sixty-four lines . average size of the substituted chromosomal segments in the cssls was of  <dig> cm and covered the whole o. glaberrima genome, except for small regions landmarked by markers rm71-rm <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and rm185-rm <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  the proportions of caiapó and mg <dig> in the cssl lines were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the remaining  <dig> % corresponded to heterozygotes and missing data. the number of introgressed segments varied between  <dig> to  <dig> per line. we observed several lines with a few heterozygous chromosomal regions, for which pollen contamination that occurred in the field between lines of the population is the most probable explanation. additional backcrossing  with marker-assisted monitoring is currently carried out to purify the genetic background of the  <dig> lines.

trait correlations
correlation coefficients among yield and yield component traits were tested for significance at p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , and are presented in table  <dig>  coefficients of phenotypic correlation were low, indicating the complexity of relationships between these traits. positively correlated traits  were plant height with yield  and panicle length , and sterility percentage with tiller number per plant . the observed correlation between plant height and yield corroborates previous yield-associated qtl studies in rice  <cit> . panicle length is largely proportional to plant height, explaining the relatively high r <dig> value. negatively correlated traits  were plant height with 1000-grain weight , and, as expected, sterility percentage with yield .

qtl analysis for yield and yield components
fourteen qtls were found for plant height , yield , tiller number per plant , 1000-grain weight  and sterility percentage  located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a major qtl for rsnv was detected on chromosome  <dig> . all qtls were detected by both the single-marker anova <dig> and interval mapping-based methods , indicating their robustness for qtl detection for this type of populations.

plant height 
two qtls  with a maximum f-test value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively were detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these qtls were also reported by  <cit>  in the same population, but based on phenotypic evaluation in a different environment.

tiller number per plant 
for this trait, three qtls  on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were detected with a maximum f-test value of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. on a region near tinb- <dig>  rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> was reported as marking a qtl for tiller number in the ir64/azucena dh population developed at the international rice research institute   <cit> http://www.gramene.org.

yield 
five qtls  were located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a maximum f-test value:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. one qtl was reported for yield in a region of approximately  <dig> cm on chromosome  <dig>  near qtl yld- <dig>  <cit> . a qtl on chromosome  <dig> near the yld- <dig> position was identified by  <cit>  in the nipponbare/kasalath f <dig> population.

sterility percentage 
two qtls  were mapped on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with a maximum f-test value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. a qtl was reported for spikelet sterility within the interval  <dig> - <dig>  cm on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , near qtl st- <dig>  reported in this study. a qtl was reported in the region of st- <dig> for pollen fertility in the cross taichung 65/o. glaberrima  <cit> .

1000-grain weight 
two qtls  were detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with maximum f-test value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit>  reported a qtl for 100-grains weight on rm <dig> locus marker, at the same locus as tgrwt- <dig> 

qtl analysis for resistance to rsnv
using both cssl finder and winqtlcart software, one highly significant qtl with an f =  <dig>  could be located on chromosome  <dig>  the qtl region was saturated with downstream and upstream ssr markers delimiting this qtl . analysing the recombination events in the region allowed us to semi-fine map the rsnv major qtl, between ssr markers rm202-rm <dig> .

discussion
segregation distortion
the phenomenon of segregation distortion , defined as a deviation from the expected mendelian segregation ratios in a segregating population, has been reported in several crops. in rice, this effect is often due to sterility genes located on several chromosomal regions. genetic interactions, genes with variable effects in regeneration by anther culture and physiological and/or environmental factors can also lead to sd  <cit> . 37%  of the markers showed distortion in favour of mg <dig> alleles on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as expected, the strongest segregation distortion was found at the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  at markers rm <dig> and rm <dig>   <cit> . this region corresponds to the genomic location of the s <dig> locus, a sporo-gametophytic sterility factor identified in previous studies. the other distorted regions matched with the chromosomal locations of o. sativa × o. glaberrima sterility loci described so far: s <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , s <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , s <dig> and s <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

comments on qtls for yield components
yield is a complex trait controlled by many genes of major or minor effect  <cit> . qtls for yield found in the present study were associated with small effects that are co-localized with qtls of the group of m-qtls  identified in other studies. m-qtls represent more than 90% of the qtls reported to date  <cit> . also, transgressive segregation was observed for all traits except tillering , demonstrating that interspecific crossing enhanced the possibility of introgressing genetic variability in cultivated rice  <cit> . although several qtls were detected on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  they should be carefully considered, because their effects could have been overestimated due to the strong segregation distortion affecting this region.

qtls for rsnv resistance
to our knowledge, this is the first identification of a genetic factor underlying resistance to the rsnv disease. in order to better elucidate the bases of genetic control of rsnv resistance, fine mapping of this region is being envisaged using recombinant event analysis in the bc4f2/f <dig> lines that we produced in  <dig> 

efficiency of cssl lines for rice breeding
breeding strategies such as marker-assisted selection  or marker-assisted backcrossing  require comprehensive dissection and understanding of the complex traits measured. development of genetics resources such as cssl lines will greatly facilitate the detection of naturally occurring allelic variation in rice and will help to acquire a better knowledge of target traits  <cit> . phenotyping strategies based on cssl populations present the advantage of a relatively small number of lines to evaluate, with the possibility of replicating evaluations over space and time. this should lead to better quality data in the case of complex, time-consuming or expensive phenotypic evaluations. genetic dissection of complex traits by associating genetic variation with introgressed fragments allows us to reduce interference effects between qtls. this helps to understand the genetic bases of reproductive barriers between species, and provides a powerful approach for qtl identification, fine mapping of qtls, laying the bases for both marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning strategies based on exploitation of wild alleles. comparison of phenotypic values between any line of the population and the recurrent parent generates high statistical power. cssl lines can be crossed in different ways in order to study epistatic interactions between qtls, develop near-isogenic lines  and do qtl pyramiding  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
usefulness of cssl libraries
wild and cultivated african rice species have been shown to be valuable sources of alleles associated with traits of agronomic importance  <cit> . however, they carry many undesirable alleles that may show strong linkage to favorable alleles, linkages that usually are very difficult to break up by conventional crossing. cssl lines give access to the original exotic allelic source, providing an elegant way of circumventing this issue, thus representing a useful and powerful tool for genetics and breeding approaches. they constitute a very useful genetic resource for studying both inheritance of agronomically important traits and directing their incorporation as progenitors in breeding programs for the development of elite germplasm with exotic characteristics of interest. the set of cssl lines presented in this study is available to the rice community through both the ciat rice outcome product line and the generation challenge programme. several research teams around the world are already using this population in their effort to locate, map and utilize new alleles associated with traits of economic importance.

development of new cssl libraries with wild genomes
the genetic diversity of crop plants has been narrowed down due to the domestication process and decades of selection. exotic genetic resources such as wild rice species can be successfully exploited to increase allelic variability into elite lines  <cit> . within the framework of a generation challenge programme project, we are now developing a series of new cssl populations, using wild aa-genome rice species  as donors. associated partners to this effort are embrapa-cnpaf , warda  and cornell university . these wild species as well as african cultivated rice show adaptation to biotic and abiotic constraints associated with specific geographic regions. transgressive segregation has been demonstrated in several studies  <cit> . the development of libraries of introgression lines makes immediate use possible for plant breeders and will simultaneously serve to enhance our understanding of the wild/cultivated allelic genetic interactions. we hope that the results of this work will contribute to a better understanding of plant performance key components and to the development of new improved rice cultivars.
