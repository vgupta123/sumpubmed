BACKGROUND
the programmed cell death  is a genetically regulated program of cell elimination, which is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and plays a very important role in several physiological processes. pcd consists of two major types, apoptosis  and autophagic cell death   <cit> . for a long time, autophagy has been described as a form of type ii programmed cell death characterized by lysosomal activation and formation of autophagosomes. it is ubiquitous among eukaryotes functioning as a lysosome degradation pathway for recycling cytoplasmic materials especially long-lived proteins  <cit> .

the formation of autophagosomes depends on the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, atg8-pe  and atg12-atg5-atg <dig> systems  <cit> . to trigger the former system, the c-terminal glycine residue of newly synthesized atg <dig> has to be exposed by a cysteine-type endopeptidase atg <dig>  subsequently, after being activated by an e1-like protein atg <dig>  atg <dig> is conjugated to pe by a specific e2-like protein atg <dig>  <cit> . in the latter system, atg <dig> is activated by atg <dig> and then transferred to an e2-like enzyme atg <dig>  via which conjugated to atg <dig>  finally, the atg12-atg <dig> conjugate interacts with atg <dig> to form a complex, which is localized to a membrane system to facilitate the maturation of autophagosomes  <cit> .

there are several major signal transduction pathways and complexes involved in the induction of autophagy. one of these pathways is mediated by a serine/threonine kinase tor , which takes part in most regulatory pathways in response to the changes in nutrient conditions and energy metabolism. tor exerts an inhibitory effect on autophagy through various downstream effectors including tap <dig> and p70s <dig> kinase  to regulate the transcription and/or translation of other related genes  <cit> . in addition to tor, members in ptdins 3-kinase class i  and iii  also participate the regulation of autophagy. pi3k-i members phosphorylate ptdinsp <dig> to produce ptdinsp <dig>  which binds to protein kinase b  and its activator pdk <dig>   <cit> . the activation of pi3k-i/akt pathway inhibits the gtpase-activating activity of tsc <dig>  leading to the relief of the inhibitory effect of rheb-gdp on tor/p70s6k signalling  <cit> . mammalian hormones glucagon and insulin inhibit tor by down-regulating pi3k-i, and so does ecdysone in d. melanogaster. the pi3k-i/akt pathway is thought to down regulate the autophagy level, while pi3k-iii, together with its membrane adaptor and autophagy protein atg <dig> , functions as an activator of autophagy and plays a crucial role in the early steps of autophagosome formation  <cit> .

recently, an explosion of studies on autophagy and cell survival indicates that autophagy may play an important role in the life cycle of eukaryotic organism. autophagy may help cells to survive in death mutants, to crosstalk with the regulation of cell proliferation, to remove toxic cytoplasmic constituents, to reduce neurotoxicity of polyglutamine expansion proteins in some neurodegenerative diseases and also to be required for necrotic cell death.  <cit> . the metamorphic development from larvae to pupa is accompanying with the degeneration of specific larval tissues, such as the salivary glands of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , intersegmental muscles  <cit> , prothoracic glands  <cit>  and silkglands of b. mori  <cit> .

the silkgland is the largest tissue in the fifth and last instar of the silkworm b. mori. it consists of three parts: anterior , middle  and posterior silkgland  <cit> . during the prepupal period, silkglands are degenerated via pcd pathway triggered by the steroid hormone ecdysone  <cit> . both apoptotic and autophagic morphologies have been observed in the asg during the larval-pupal metamorphosis, but the connections between them are still unclear  <cit> . the pupal differentiation of silkgland starts on the first day of the fifth instar and cell death in asg is initiated on the third day  <cit> . besides the pcd phenomenon found in asg, we have also observed autophagic vacuolar formation in msg during the prepupal period . these findings indicate that autophagy may play a very important part in the differentiation and degeneration of silkgland, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. thus we performed a genome-wide search of autophagy-related genes in b. mori, aiming at remodelling the preliminary autophagy pathway for further systematic investigations.

RESULTS
identification of autophagy-related genes in b. mori
the autophagy-related genes from databases of s. cerevisiae, d. melanogaster, a. mellifera and h. sapiens genome were collected as queries. using the blast website silkwormblast to search against the silkworm genome database , more than  <dig> autophagy-related genes could be identified as the top hits. however, even after a series of more sensitive profile-based searches, other members remain absent probably due to the low level of sequence homology. all hits of an e-value <1e- <dig> and alignment of >25% were collected and listed in table  <dig>  most of these genes are involved in the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems and the upstream signal transduction pathway. besides, we also collected some important proteins taking part in the regulation of autophagy, including the protein serine/threonine kinase atg <dig>  <cit> , integral membrane protein atg <dig>  <cit> , phosphoinositide binding protein atg <dig>  <cit>  and the heat shock cognate protein hsc <dig>  <cit>  .

ahomologues were identified by a blast search against the silkworm genome database .

bthe alignment parameters were set as e-value of < 1e- <dig> and alignment of >25%.

remodelling the autophagy pathway
autophagy-related genes were first identified in yeast, and their homologs have recently been found and functionally characterized in higher eukaryotes. evolutionary analyses indicated that autophagy is a highly conserved process among eukaryotes, such as yeast, plant, insect and mammal  <cit> . based on the current knowledge, we remodel a preliminary autophagy pathway in b. mori . in the upstream signal transduction pathway, autophagic responses are developed by a series of kinases and phosphatases. tor and pi3k are the major regulators in this signal transduction process . in the atg8-pe ubiquitin-like conjugation system, the last residue asn <dig> of bmatg <dig> is proposed to be cleaved by bmatg <dig> for exposure of a c-terminal glycine residue. then the modified bmatg <dig> is activated by the e1-like enzyme bmatg <dig> and finally transferred to pe by e2-like enzyme bmatg <dig>  in the atg12-atg5-atg <dig> system, bmatg <dig> should be activated by bmatg <dig> to form a complex with bmatg <dig>  subsequently, the bmatg12-bmatg <dig> conjugate interacts with bmatg <dig>  a protein containing a coiled-coil domain that mediates self-multimerization and the formation of an assembly of ~350-kda . all members in atg12-atg5-atg <dig> conjugation pathway have been identified from the silkdb except for atg <dig>  .

most autophagy-related genes are actively transcribed in the silkgland
from the 6th day through the fifth instar, both apoptotic and autophagic morphologies in the asg  <cit>  and msg  have been observed. we extracted total rna from the silkglands of fifth instar larvae on the 3rd day to validate these in silico identified genes by reverse-transcription pcr. some representative pcr products were shown in figure  <dig>  bmatg <dig>  bmatg <dig>  bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> are genes involved in ubiquitin-like conjugation systems; bmatg <dig>  bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> are required for formation of autophagosomes; homologs of p70s6k, pkb and rheb are members of the upstream signal transduction pathways;hsc <dig> mediates the chaperone-mediated autophagy.

furthermore, full-length cdnas of bmatg <dig>  bmatg <dig>  bmatg <dig>  bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> have been sequenced and deposited in genbank under the accession numbers of fj <dig>  fj <dig>  fj <dig>  fj <dig> and fj <dig>  respectively. all proteins encoded by these genes are homogeneous to their orthologs in other eukaryotes , indicating high conservation of the ubiquitin-like pathways in b. mori.

in the silkdb, we found only a 5' fragment of putative bmatg <dig>  to obtain its full-length cdna, we used 3' race pcr method to amplify the unknown 3' flanking sequences. first-strand cdna reverse-transcribed with an oligo-adaptor primer from total rna was used as the template for 3' race pcr with gene specific primer gsp <dig> and out primer. the 3' race pcr product of bmatg <dig> was inserted into pgm-t vector for sequencing, and then this 3' segment was spliced with sequence of bgibmga007878-ta  to obtain the full-length cdna sequence of bmatg <dig>  the complete coding sequence of bmatg <dig>  has been deposited in genbank under the accession number of fj <dig>  compared with the orthologs in other eukaryotes, bmatg <dig> has the two highly conserved atg <dig> binding domains  and one atg <dig> conjugation site  .

successful amplification of the coding sequences of some key autophagy-related genes listed in table  <dig> indicated that they are indeed actively transcribed in the silkgland. comparison to the orthologs further validated the high level of conservation of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems in the silkworm b. mori.

both bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> are up-regulated along the maturation of silkgland as revealed by semi-quantitative pcr
in attempt to monitor the expression pattern of some indicator genes in the silkgland at different stages of the fifth instar, we performed a time-course transcriptional profiling of bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig>  in mammalian cells, the protein levels of atg5-atg <dig> and/or lc3-ii  have been used as indicators for the autophagic activity  <cit> . multiple alignments  <cit>  indicated that both atg <dig> and atg <dig> homologs have an ubiquitin-like fold and a highly conserved glycine residue at the c-terminal region , which is essential for their conjugation to atg <dig> and atg <dig>  respectively. therefore, we used the transcription levels of bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> to indicate the autophagic activity in the silkgland of b. mori.

total rna from the silkgland on each day in the fifth instar larvae was prepared for reverse-transcription. double-stranded cdna samples of the same quantity were used as templates for semi-quantitative pcr with primers for bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig>  respectively. the quantification of the bands was performed by gis 1d software  and ratio of amplified target bmatg8/bmatg <dig> to standard actin <dig> was calculated. as shown in figure  <dig>  the transcriptional levels of both bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> exhibit an overall tendency of increase from 1st to 8th day, and reach a plateau on the 4th day  and the 5th day  of fifth instar larvae, respectively. these results suggested a significant up-regulation of autophagic level in the silkgland of fifth instar larvae, which is in agreement with the previous histochemical investigations  <cit> . thus we suggested that autophagy should take a crucial part in the differentiation and degeneration of the silkgland in prepupal of b. mori.

discussion
along the metamorphic development from larvae to pupa, some larval organs of b. mori such as the larval midgut, intersegmental muscles and silkglands are degenerated and new imaginal structures are developed. the histolysis of these tissues was proposed to be achieved via programmed cell death and the degradation process in the asg cells display both autophagic and apoptotic characteristics  <cit> . however, the b. mori genes or proteins required for autophagy have not been well characterized as those identified from the yeast or human  <cit> .

in the present work, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and found  <dig> autophagy-related proteins as the top hits from the silkdb . all homologs involved in the two ubiquitin-like pathways have been found in b. mori except for atg <dig> which has not been identified from other two model insects, neither fruitfly nor honeybee. as well known, the e2-like enzyme atg <dig> plays a very important part in transferring atg <dig> to atg <dig>  it remains a puzzle that how the atg12-atg5-atg <dig> conjugation system works without a functional atg <dig>  after performing a multiple alignment of the primary sequences of atg <dig> against those of e2-like enzyme atg <dig> from different species, we found that atg <dig> proteins of some insects have low homology to mammalian atg <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  both atg <dig> and atg <dig> have a highly conserved c-terminal catalytic cysteine  which is essential for the conjugation  <cit> . bmatg <dig> might be able to recognize both bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> which share an ubiquitin-like fold and a highly conserved glycine residue at the c-terminal region . thus we hypothesize that the function of atg <dig> could be compensated by atg <dig> in b. mori and other lepidoptera insects. further in vivo experiments, especially identification of the e2-like enzyme of atg <dig>  are necessary to verify this hypothesis.

based on these  <dig> genes and their high degree of conservation to the orthologs identified and functionally characterized in higher eukaryotes  <cit> , a preliminary autophagy pathway in b. mori was remodelled . in addition to these in silico analyses, rt-pcr results strongly indicated that autophagy-related genes in ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are indeed actively transcribed in the silkgland. this is in agreement with the previous report that b. mori silkglands are committed to undergo pcd from the 3rd day of the fifth instar and are degenerated completely soon after pupation  <cit> . to verify the temporal control of this process, we performed a time-course transcriptional profiling of two indicator genes bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> via semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis. as expected, the transcriptional levels of both bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> exhibit a general tendency of increase from 1st to 8th day.

CONCLUSIONS
as an evolutionarily conserved and finely regulated process, autophagy plays a very important role in various biological events during the whole life of eukaryotes, including the metamorphic development of b. mori. in the present work, we identified over  <dig> autophagy-related genes and remodelled the autophagy pathway in b. mori. using the total rna extracted from the silkgland of the fifth instar larvae on the 3rd day as the initial template, the coding sequences of several key genes were further cloned by reverse transcription pcr and/or 3' race pcr experiments, indicating that most autophagy-related genes are actively transcribed in the silkgland. furthermore, semi-quantitative pcr results indicated that both bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> are up-regulated in fifth instar larvae of b. mori. taken together, our findings, in combination with the previous histochemical investigations, evidently suggest that autophagy executes a very important role in the differentiation and degeneration of silkgland during the metamorphosis from larva to pupa.
