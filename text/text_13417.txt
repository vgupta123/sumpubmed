BACKGROUND
microarray techniques provide a way of monitoring gene expressions on a global scale. an important application of microarray is to discover subsets of genes that are associated with occurrence of certain diseases, for example breast cancer, leukemia or lymphoma. biomedical studies have been conducted to measure gene expression levels and patients' survival information simultaneously. this article is partly motivated by studies like the mantle cell lymphoma  study reported in  <cit> , where expression levels of  <dig> genes and survival information are measured for  <dig> subjects. a main goal of the mcl study is to discover subsets of genes that are linked with patients' survival risk. statistically, standard estimation approaches cannot yield a unique estimator, when the dimension of gene expressions is greater than the sample size. biologically, it is reasonable to assume that only a small number of genes are relevant to predicting the lymphoma occurrence. it is thus of great interest to develop statistical methodologies that can carry out simultaneous estimation and dimension reduction or variable selection.

dimension reduction has been extensively investigated for linear regression models  <cit> . one widely used approach is to use low dimensional projections of the covariates  as surrogates for the true covariates. examples include the ridge regression, partial least squares , and principal component regression . for a detailed discussion, see  <cit> . including all the covariates in the predictive models through projections may introduce noises and lead to poor predictive performance. in addition, the underlying assumption that all covariates are associated with the disease progression is not necessarily true.

an alternative approach is to use variable selection techniques and identify the important covariates. this can usually be accomplished by using penalization methods, where penalties with data dependent tuning parameters are used to control the sparsity of the models. a general scheme is outlined in  <cit> . penalization methods are especially effective when there exist a small number of large covariate effects. compared with projection approaches, penalized variable selection may be preferred in microarray studies since it is capable of selecting a small number of individual covariates and only those covariates are used in the predictive models. further biological investigation can focus on those identified influential genes only.

modeling survival outcome with high dimensional gene expressions is more challenging due to the presence of censoring and the use of complicated semiparametric models. one approach used by  <cit>  is to cluster genes first, and then use the sample averages of the gene expression levels in a cox model for right censored survival outcome. another well developed clustering based algorithm is the gene harvesting procedure of  <cit> . standard pls method has been employed in  <cit> , where the resulted pls components are used in the cox model. a penalized estimation procedure has been considered for the cox model using kernels  <cit> , under the assumption that the covariate effects are smooth functions of gene expression levels. the lasso  type estimator in the cox model with right censored data has been proposed  <cit> , and  <cit>  applies the lars algorithm in computing the lasso estimator in the cox model. in a recent study,  <cit>  applies the principal component regression to additive risk models with right censored data. aforementioned studies, except  <cit> , assume the proportional hazards models for survival time. although this is the most straightforward assumption, it is not necessarily satisfied.

survival analysis assuming the additive risk model may provide more insights beyond the proportional hazards model analysis. an additive model is generally adopted when it is reasonable to assume that the covariate effects under consideration contribute additively to the conditional hazard. consider one special form of the additive risk models investigated in  <cit> , where we model the conditional hazard at time t by

given a d-dimensional vector of time-independent covariates z. here β <dig> and λ <dig> denote the unknown regression parameter and the unknown baseline hazard function, respectively. previous studies have concluded its sound biological and empirical basis  <cit>  and satisfactory statistical properties  <cit> .

the objective function under the additive risk model proposed in  <cit>  takes a least-squares form, which makes estimation computationally easier than under the proportional hazards model. this is especially important for high dimensional microarray studies where computation cost is a serious concern. inspired by the special form of the objective function, we propose a lasso approach for estimation and gene selection in the additive risk model , which minimizes a least-squares objective function subject to a l <dig> constraint, when high dimensional microarray measurements are present. because of the nature of the l <dig> constraint, the lasso method shrinks coefficients and sets some estimated coefficients exactly zero. thus it can yield a sparse model.

in this article, we investigate survival analysis with high dimensional gene expressions under the additive risk model. the goal is to provide an alternative estimation and gene selection method, when the proportional hazard assumption cannot be satisfied. beyond modeling the survival risk in an additive manner, the proposed approach is computationally affordable and well behaved. evaluation of stability of individual genes and overall predictive power, which has been ignored in some of previous studies, are also investigated.

RESULTS
mcl data
a study using microarray expression analysis of mantle cell lymphoma  is reported in  <cit> . the primary goal of this study is to discover genes that have good predictive power of patients' survival risk. among  <dig> untreated patients with no history of previous lymphoma included in this study,  <dig> were classified as having mcl, based on established morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria. survival times of  <dig> patients were available and other  <dig> patients were censored. the median survival time was  <dig>  years . lymphochip dna microarrays  <cit>  were used to quantify mrna expressions in the lymphoma samples from the  <dig> patients. the gene expression data that contains expression values of  <dig> cdna elements  is available at  <cit> .

we use the additive risk model  for the conditional hazards given the gene expression values and apply the proposed lasso method. although there is no theoretical or numerical limitation on the number of probes that can be used in the proposed approach, we pre-process the data as follows to exclude noises and gain further stability:  un-supervised screening: compute the interquartile ranges of all gene expressions. remove the probes with interquartile ranges smaller than their first quartile.  <dig> probes pass this screening;  supervised screening: compute correlation coefficients of the uncensored survival times with gene expressions. select the  <dig> probes with the largest absolute values of the correlation coefficients. we refer to  <cit>  for more discussions of gene screening. we then standardize these  <dig> probes to have mean  <dig> and variance  <dig> 

in applying the proposed lasso approach, we select the tuning parameter u via the five-fold cross validation. we show in figure  <dig> the cv score as a function of the tuning parameter u. there is a well-defined minimum at u =  <dig> . using this cross validated tuning parameter, only  <dig> out of  <dig> probes have nonzero estimated coefficients in the predictive model. we show in table  <dig> the list of those six probes, their official symbols, estimates and corresponding oi . two of these six probes, uniqid  <dig> and  <dig>  are from the same gene tk <dig> 

the descriptions of the six probes can be found at the ncbi website  <cit> . rad <dig>  is highly expressed in organs of germ cells and lymphoid development. the protein encoded by this gene has been shown to play a role in homologous recombination related repair of dna double-strand breaks. defects in rad54l may be a cause of tumor formation. mutations of the tumor suppressor gene socs- <dig>  in classical hodgkin lymphoma are frequent and associated with nuclear phospho-stat <dig> accumulation. methylation of the socs- <dig> gene is associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage and reduced expression of socs- <dig> in gc tissues. it has also been shown that socs- <dig> stringently regulates development and homeostasis of interleukin- <dig> and interleukin- <dig> in t lymphocyte. in lymphoma, decreased expression of p <dig>  has been observed in about 50% of cases. p <dig> plays a role in negatively regulating the cell proliferation of thyroid lymphoma cells and decreased expression of it contributes to the progression of the disease. aberrant dna methylation of this gene occurs in the promoter region in lymphoid malignancies of b-cell phenotype peripheral blood tk <dig>  isozyme is a useful independent biochemical marker for the subgroup of adult non-hodgkin's lymphoma who respond poorly to current therapy  <cit> . in a clinical study, it is shown that long-term treatment of h <dig> human lymphoid cells in the presence of dideoxycytidine may down-regulate tk <dig> gene expression. the ring domain of uhrf <dig>  is a functional determinant of growth regulation and uhrf <dig> is generally required in tumor cell proliferation.

all six probes are either directly associated with lymphoma or important in tumor proliferation. the encouraging discovery results partly support the effectiveness of the proposed additive model and lasso approach. out of the six probes in table  <dig>  two  are also identified in  <cit> . we note that the difference between the sets of probes identified is at least partly caused by the difference in model assumptions. in our study, an additive risk model is assumed, whereas in  <cit>  a cox model assumption is made.

evaluation is carried out using the leave-one-out  approach proposed in the methods section. note that for each reduced dataset , we carry out the supervised screening and select possibly different set of  <dig> probes out of the probes that pass the unsupervised screening. since the unsupervised screening is mainly due to technical considerations and the survival outcome is not used in the selection, the evaluation results are expected to accurately reflect the stability and prediction power.

the ois of individual probes are computed and shown in figure  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  red dots represent the six probes identified using the proposed approach; while black dots represent the rest  <dig> genes. we can see that genes identified via lasso have larger ois than the rest probes, indicating greater importance. this also shows that the proposed approach is relatively stable. we see from table  <dig> that five out of those six probes have ois close to  <dig>  gene socs- <dig> has smaller oi , but it is still larger than ois for the unselected probes.

the overall predictive performance is also evaluated using the loo approach. we generate two hypothetical risk groups of equal sizes based on the predictive risk scores. we show in figure  <dig> survival functions of the two risk groups. we can clearly see that the two survival functions differ significantly. chi-square test of the difference yields test statistic  <dig>  and p-value  <dig> . so we can conclude that the proposed approach can satisfactorily predict survival risk based on selected gene expression measurements.

to our best knowledge, the only available published article dealing with additive risk model and high dimensional gene measurements is  <cit> , where the pcr is used for model reduction. since the pcr is not a variable selection method, it is not directly comparable to the proposed lasso approach. hence we only consider the following simple alternative approach for comparison. we identify ten probes with marginally largest  correlation coefficients with the event time for uncensored subjects. ten probes are selected so that the degree of freedom is slightly larger than but roughly matches the lasso approach. predictive models are constructed using those ten probes only. we compute the predictive power using the proposed loo based approach and obtain a chi-square test statistic  <dig> , which is also significant with p-value  <dig> . the difference between the two risk groups is smaller than that from the proposed approach, which suggests less predictive power.

we note that in table  <dig> two probes  correspond to the same gene tk <dig>  it has been suggested in literature that analysis can be carried out at the gene level by combining measurements from two or multiple probes. however, we find that the correlations of two  probes from the same genes in the mcl data can be low. so it is not clear whether it is proper to simply take a summary measure such as the average of the two probes or arbitrarily discard one of them in the analysis. in our study, we follow  <cit>  and carry out the analysis at the probe level.

dlbcl data
the dlbcl  data was first analyzed in  <cit> . this dataset consists of  <dig> patients with dlbcl, including  <dig> patient deaths during the followup. expression profiles of  <dig> probes are obtained. missing values are imputed using a nearest neighbor approach as in  <cit> . we carry out supervised selection and select  <dig> probes with the largest absolute values of marginal correlation coefficients with the uncensored event times to gain further stability. probes are then normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.

five-fold cross validation is used to determine the optimal tuning parameter. a plot  similar to figure  <dig> yields optimal u =  <dig> . with the optimal u,  <dig> probes have nonzero estimated coeficients in the predictive model. for the genes corresponding to these probes, their official symbols, descriptions, estimated coefficients and corresponding ois are shown in table  <dig> 

five probes in table  <dig>  are also identified in  <cit> . quite a few probes we identify have been confirmed to be associated with lymphoma by other independent studies. the level of lactose dehydrogenase  can go high in reaction to many different kinds of stress or damage to body tissues. as tissues are damaged they release more ldh. although an ldh test isn't very useful for an initial diagnosis of lymphoma it is frequently used as monitoring test for those who already have lymphoma. any elevation from the normal range may indicate a relapse or renewed growth. the probe from the gene hs. <dig>  has been shown to play an important role in development of dlbcl  <cit> . abnormal expression of nm <dig> is associated with malignant potential, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage, and it may play a role in development of gastric cancer. complement component receptor- <dig>  is the membrane protein on b lymphocytes to which the epstein-barr virus  binds during infection of these cells. ebv/c3d receptor interacts with the p <dig> anti-oncoprotein expressed in the human b lymphoma cells. hla-dma  and hla-dqb <dig>  belong to the hla class ii alpha chain paralogues. this class ii molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha  and a beta chain , both anchored in the membrane. it plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. class ii molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells . the probe corresponding to the gene hs. <dig>  is a candidate oncogene found in amplification of 8p <dig>  and translocated in an immunoblastic b-cell lymphoma cell line. mmp- <dig>  expression has significant correlation with tumor invasion, tumor differentiation and lymph node metastases; mmp- <dig> may participate in the development of lymph node micrometastasis of gastric carcinoma. strong mmp- <dig> expression is correlated with a favorable prognosis of hodgkin's lymphoma.

stability of individual probes is evaluated using the proposed oi. figure  <dig> shows the oi computed from the loo approach. we can see that several genes we identify have larger ois than the rest. however, some identified genes have ois close to zero. on the other hand, there are a few probes with large ois but are not included in the predictive model. figure  <dig> suggests that the "signals" in the dlbcl data are not as strong as in the mcl data and the final predictive model is less reliable. we note that with a relatively small sample size and large number of probes, the randomness caused by the finite fold cross validation is not ignorable. this partly accounts for the small ois for some identified genes.

for probes with small ois: it is still not clear what the biological functions are for the gene with uniqid  <dig> ; gene hs. <dig> has similar functions as hs. <dig>  with the lasso approach, only one gene  tends to be selected. this partly explains why oi for hs. <dig> is much smaller than that of hs. <dig>  similar explanation holds for the oi of gene hs. <dig> ; for genes hs. <dig> and hs. <dig>  there are documented studies showing they are associated with lymphoma or in general tumor progressions.

the overall prediction power of the proposed approach is assessed with the approach described in the methods section. the chi-square statistic  is  <dig> , with p-value  <dig> . we thus conclude that the proposed approach can effectively predict survival risks based on a small subset of selected genes. as an alternative, the simple approach with  <dig> marginally most important probes yields chi-square statistic  <dig>  . so unlike the mcl data, the simple approach cannot predict survival risk based on marginally selected genes.

CONCLUSIONS
it is of great practical interest to develop sound statistical techniques that are capable of identifying a small subset of influential genes and predicting survival risks based on selected genes. in this article, we assume the additive risk model for survival times and propose using lasso for simultaneous estimation and gene selection. this is the first attempt to use the additive risk model and penalized variable selection in microarray survival study. evaluation of individual genes and overall prediction performance are based on the loo techniques. we analyze the mcl and dlbcl data using the proposed approach. empirical studies show that the proposed approach can identify a small subset of genes with satisfactory prediction performance. most of the genes we identify have been shown to be associated with lymphoma in other studies. the effectiveness of the additive model and the lasso method is supported by the satisfactory prediction performance, reasonable gene discovery results and the correspondence between the oi and published gene discovery results.

in this article, additive risk model is assumed, whereas in most previous studies, cox model assumption is made. in the additive model, we assume the genes contribute to the survival hazard in an additive manner. so the estimation results may be easier to explain than those from the cox model. possible alternative survival models include the accelerated failure time and accelerated hazard models. each model has its own advantages and is preferred under different circumstances. with high dimensional microarray measurements, it is still an open question how to compare different survival model fitting results. such a comparison study is beyond the scope of this article.

with the proposed lasso approach, we are able to identify individual gene effects. this advantage is not shared by approaches like the principal component analysis or the partial least squares. however, the tradeoff is that the number of gene effects can be evaluated is limited by the sample size. if it is biologically reasonable to believe that the number of genes significantly associated with survival is larger than the sample size, then transformation of the gene expressions will be firstly needed. one possibility is to use linear combinations of individual gene expressions as covariates. we postpone pursuing this to a separate study.
