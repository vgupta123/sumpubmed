BACKGROUND
the whitefly bemisia tabaci   is a broad phloem feeding herbivore. b. tabaci is a complex of  <dig> putative morphocryptic species  <cit>  and one of the most damaging pests of protected, field crops and ornamentals worldwide  <cit> . the current global status of b. tabaci as a pest refers mainly to two species of the complex, meam <dig>  and med  which are both highly invasive and polyphagous  and particularly detrimental by transmitting viruses which cause serious crop diseases.

currently, the control of b. tabaci relies on insecticides. however, their extensive and chronic use has imposed strong selection pressures for resistance to many insecticide classes in b. tabaci, including neonicotinoids, which are the world market leaders of insecticides . neonicotinoids act by binding on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors . imidacloprid was the first neonicotinoid introduced in the market in  <dig> followed by acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and clothianidin  <cit> .

insecticide resistance is typically characterized by a variety of molecular aberrations, such as transcriptional changes, gene amplification and point mutations in coding regions, which in turn result in phenotypic novelties like increased rates of insecticide detoxification or reduced sensitivity of the target protein. the most significant mechanisms of resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides are decreased target-site sensitivity and increased metabolic detoxification by cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenages  <cit> . in b. tabaci, it was shown that the cytochome p <dig> cyp6cm <dig> is the major resistance mechanism, as the gene expression is highly associated with the resistance phenotype in a number of populations worldwide  <cit> , and it encodes a protein capable of metabolising neonicotinoids  to less toxic metabolites  <cit> .

the phenomenon of insecticide resistance is particularly striking in mediterranean countries, where suitable climatic conditions allow year-round crop production and the survival of b. tabaci  <cit> . highly resistant med populations have been reported in crete, a major vegetable crop production area in greece, especially towards the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid  <cit> . pymetrozine, pyriproxifen and spiromesifen, have been introduced and used in rotation with neonicotinoids, alongside an extensive use of natural enemies in whitefly control programs in the last  <dig> years in crete. however, a recent resistance monitoring study from various locations in southern crete in  <dig>  showed that neonicotinoid resistance is still present in crete  <cit> .

the b. tabaci cytochome p <dig> cyp6cm <dig> was found to be over-expressed in cretan populations; however, in some cases resistance ratios were not strongly correlated with cyp6cm <dig> expression level, suggesting that additional neonicotinoid resistance mechanisms may operate in crete  <cit> .

rna sequencing  was the decisive tool to perform de novo transcriptome sequencing and has already been applied in transcriptome analysis of insects, such as aedes aegypti, anopheles funestus, nilaparvata lugens, locusta migratoria, b. tabaci, trialeurodes vaporariorum  and mites  <cit> , providing not only a better understanding of their biological functions at the molecular level but also genomic recourses on detoxification and target genes putatively involved in insecticide resistance  <cit> . some recent studies have utilized these techniques to explore differences between resistance phenotypes in insects of medical importance such as a. aegypti  <cit>  and cimex lectularius  <cit> . in b. tabaci, there is a number of transcriptome resources generated by roche  <dig> pyrosequencing or illumina deep sequencing which have substantially improved our understanding on topics such as; symbiosis, virus-vector interactions, bauveria bassiana infection, gut role or gene expression in different developmental stages and genetic groups within b. tabaci . to date only one study dealt with differential gene expression in strains with different resistant phenotypes  <cit> . moreover, only a small percentage of the b. tabaci transcriptome data available explores the transcriptome of the med lineage of this complex species  <cit> .

in the present study bioassays and transcriptome data from the med species were analyzed to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for neonicotinoid resistance in b. tabaci from crete. twelve libraries from three resistant and one susceptible b. tabaci strain including biological replicates were sequenced with the illumina platform, and generated about  <dig> gbp of sequence data. this high throughput sequencing technique has allowed for global expression profiling of neonicotinoid resistant and susceptible populations. a reference transcriptome was built by de novo assembly and functionally annotated. it was then used to map the reads from insecticide-susceptible and resistant strains, study the levels of gene expression and gain genetic information for resistance mechanisms.

RESULTS
resistant phenotypes towards neonicotinoids
based on recent resistance monitoring in cretan b. tabaci med, we chose the whitefly populations used in the present study from those displaying the highest resistance phenotypes and heaviest neonicotinoid treatment history. three field derived strains originally collected from eggplants maintained in the laboratory on cotton plants under imidacloprid  or acetamiprid selection  for few  generations were used in this study, along with their parental ‘relaxed’ strains , namely the respective original strains maintained in the absence of any insecticide contact. all comparisons were performed with a local susceptible reference strain , collected in crete in  <dig>  in order to access differences at the transcription level linked with differences at the resistance phenotypes.

mortality data and resistance ratios  to the three neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiachloprid were determined by classical leaf dip bioassays on adult females . compared to the reference susceptible strain s-gr <dig>  rr ranged from  <dig> to 56-fold for imidacloprid, from  <dig> to 20-fold for acetamiprid and > 1000-fold for thiacloprid. resistance ratios in the presence of piperonyl butoxide , an inhibitor of monooxygenases, were also investigated. imidacloprid toxicity was increased in all strains  after pre-exposure to pbo , indicating that cytochrome p <dig> are involved in the reduced susceptibility against imidacloprid. the absence of complete suppression of resistance after pre-exposure to pbo treatment could indicate either the involvement of another resistance mechanism or the limited capacity of the use of pbo to detect p <dig> based insecticide resistance  <cit> .table  <dig> the neonicotinoid response of the susceptible s-gr <dig> and the resistant b. tabaci laboratory strains. toxicological data to the neonicotinoids imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid and toxicity of imidacloprid after pre-exposure to synergist piperonyl butoxide

compared to their relaxed parental strains, the respective selected strains exhibited higher resistance levels towards acetamiprid and imidacloprid but not towards thiacloprid, indicating that the mechanism underlying resitance to thiacloprid is not selected by imidacloprid or acetamiprid treatments.

the higher resistance levels against neonicotinoids were exhibited by strains gr4-as and gr9-is, each selected with a different neonicotinoid . these two strains were therefore chosen for styding their transcriptomic profile in the rna-seq experiment in comparison to the susceptible s-gr <dig>  which was used as a reference strain. in order to better understand the part of b. tabaci transcriptom changes linked to the resistance, we compared also strains with the same genetic background which differ only in their resistant level. the pair gr4-ap and gr4-as displayed the higher differences  among the three selected-parental pairs of strains . therefore the parental strain gr4-ap was also included in the rna-seq experiment.

pre-processing treatment reads assembly and functional annotation
illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing of  <dig> cdna libraries  from four b. tabaci strains  yielded more than  <dig> million paired-end reads. the pre-processing technique  resulted to  <dig>  million reads .

the short read sequences were deposited into the sequence read archive , . the full list of transcript sequences is available upon request from the corresponding author.

the number of reads was evenly distributed among the  <dig> libraries, with an average of  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  million reads. the summary of reads per library used in the subsequent analysis is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the intra- and inter-sample fraction for the contaminant ribosomal rna as well as the mitochondrial cdna was also similar among them  indicating moderate variation between libraries.

de novo assembly performed using trinity produced  <dig>  contigs  corresponding to  <dig>  unigenes .

to evaluate the accuracy of the assembled sequences , all the usable sequencing reads were aligned onto the transcripts using bowtie <dig>  a high percentage of reads  were successfully back-mapped on this assembly and at least  <dig>  % of the mapped reads were proper pairs.

similarity between the trinity assembly and nr ncbi protein database was examined using blastx and disclosed  <dig>  contigs with coverage higher than 80 %. in addition, similarity to a dataset of  <dig> complete mrna of b. tabaci downloaded from ncbi, using blastn, disclosed  <dig> contigs and  <dig> b. tabaci mrna sequences that met the criteria initially set . the average identity was  <dig>  %, similar to the level of sequencing accuracy already reported for illumina technology  <cit> .

the blastx search  returned  <dig>  contigs with at least one blast hit. additionally,  <dig>  contigs were found with blastn performed on the remaining  contigs  . interpro scan returned  <dig>  contigs with a protein domain match.table  <dig> annotation summary


aunique unigenes



to identify the possible functions, gene ontology  assignments were used to classify the sequences. a total of  <dig>  contigs with at least one go term  were found. the sequences were categorized to ten molecular function , thirteen biological process  and seven cellular unigenes  categories in go level  <dig>  . the go classification results are in line with previous sequenced transcriptomes of b. tabaci  <cit> , t. vaporariorum  <cit>  and b. oleae  <cit>  where binding, cell, catalytic activity and metabolic process were the four largest groups.

the potential enzymes were characterized based on the chemical reaction they catalyze using the prediction of enzyme commission  numbers for each sequence. among the  <dig>  annotated contigs,  <dig>  contigs were classified to  <dig> different ec numbers. enzyme classification revealed that transferases are the largest group of b. tabaci med enzymes  followed by oxydoreductases , hydrolases , lyases  ligases  and isomerases .

to identify the biological pathways that are active in the b. tabaci med, we mapped all contigs with ec number  to the reference canonical pathways in kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome . in total, we assigned  <dig>   contigs to  <dig> kegg pathways. the pathways mostly represented by the assembled sequences were purine metabolism , arginine and proline metabolism  and pyrimidine metabolism . contigs for pathways that could be involved in detoxification like metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig> , drug metabolism - cytochrome p <dig> , drug metabolism - other enzymes , oxidative phosphorylation , glutathione metabolism  and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism  were also represented .

sequences encoding the targets of the major classes of synthetic insecticides as well as enzymes potentially involved in the xenobiotic detoxification were extracted and compared with sequences from the ncbi protein database. genes putatively involved in the insecticide metabolic resistance are summarized in table  <dig>  including conventional detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , carboxylesterases  glutathione s-transferases , udp-glycosyltranferases  and abc transporters . putative insecticide targets including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor  and acetylcholinesterase  are also shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> summary of contigs putatively involved in insecticide resistance

investigating target-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors- mediated resistance
in other insect species, mutations as well as alterations in the expression levels of nachrs, the target of neonicotinoids, have been associated with neonicotinoid resistance  <cit> . focused on these genes, we performed a phylogenetic study and investigated sequence polymorphism and expression levels of the nachrs.

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  are ligand gated ion channels  and serve an important role in nerve signaling, at the post-synaptic membrane, by mediating the fast actions of acetylcholine  at cholinergic synapses. neonicotinoid insecticides and spinosad have high and selective affinity for many arthropod nachrs  <cit> .

the phylogenetic analysis including  <dig> contigs and  <dig> nachr protein sequences from other insect species revealed  <dig> nachr orthologs in b. tabaci med encoding putative receptor subunits . a comparative number of subunits  was found in a. pisum, an. gambiae, ap. mellifera, b. mori, d. melanogaster and t. castaneum. nine nachr subunits, α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  and β <dig> were grouped into highly conserved core groups and were named accordingly  <cit> . interestingly, as in other insects, b. tabaci contained a subunit which showed particularly low sequence identity with other nach receptors and was clustered into a divergent group including subunits α <dig> and β <dig> of a. mellifera, β <dig> of d. melanogaster, α <dig> and α <dig> of t. castaneum. the bidirectional best hits of this subunit against all insects and acari nachr are for lοcusta migratoria α <dig>  and t. castaneum α <dig> . however, in this subunit one of the two vicinal cysteines of the motif yxcc at loop c, defining α subunits, was replaced by a histidine and is therefore named β <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of b. tabaci nachr subunits. maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of b. tabaci med  and nachr subunit protein sequences from  <dig> species: d. melanogaster , a. mellifera , t. castaneum , a. gambiae , b. mori , a. pisum , b. tabaci . sequences were aligned using mafft and a bootstrapped midpoint-rooted tree was constructed . bootstrap percentage is indicated for crucial branches. for accession numbers of insects nachr subunit protein sequences see additional file 5: figure s2



sequence comparison results show that most of the b. tabaci nachr subunits contained a gek motif preceding tm <dig> , a highly conserved motif in most insect nachr subunits where the glutamate residue is considered to be associated with cation selectivity. however, the gek motif was replaced by rek in α <dig> and by ΜΕr in β <dig>  such results have been also observed in b. mori where the motif was replaced by str in α <dig> and β <dig>  and by tir in β <dig>  <cit> . whether b. tabaci med α <dig> and β <dig> possess the cation selectivity as other gek-motif-containing achr subunits remains to be determined.

it is worth noting that two subunits were represented by variant isoforms: α <dig> and α <dig> with  <dig> and  <dig> variants respectively. alternative splicing occurs commonly and has been observed in the α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig> subunits in many insects including a. melifera  <cit> , a. pisum  <cit> , b. mori  <cit> , t. castaneum  <cit> . it effectively diversifies receptor function and generates species-specific isoforms by introducing variations in the cys-loop that are involved in receptor assembly, in loops e and b. these variations contribute to ligand binding in the second transmembrane domain, which forms the ion channel between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  that are important in coupling agonist binding to ion channel gating  <cit> . together with alternative splicing, post transcriptional rna a to i editing  and other alterations like truncated transcripts  contribute in largely increase the diversification of nach receptors between insect species  and counterpart the low number of insect subunits compared to vertebrate nachr. whether the different isoforms observed in nachr subunits α <dig> and α <dig> of b. tabaci consist of alternative transcripts or not, clearly warrant further investigation by combining transcriptomic and genomic data.

we found substantial variation in expression levels between the different subunits of nach receptors. in all strains, subunit β <dig> was the most highly expressed  followed by the α <dig>  and the similarly expressed α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> . the lower expressed subunit was α  <dig> with only ten mapped reads . we also examined if differential gene expression occurred between strains. de was found for β <dig> between s-gr <dig> and gr4-ap  or gr4-as  and for subunit α <dig> between s-gr <dig> and gr9-is . whether this differential gene expression between resistant and susceptible strains for subunits β <dig> and α <dig> contributes to the observed resistance phenotypes needs further examination. however, it is interesting to point to recent studies that established a link between nachr expression and response to neonicotinoids. taillebois et al.  <cit>  showed that pre-exposure to different neonicotinoids significantly affected the expression levels of some subunits which were depended on the nature of the insecticide. the importance of differential expression of subunits in the regulation of neonicotinoid sensitivity is also suggested by the findings of yu et al.  <cit> , who observed a significant decrease of expression of β <dig> and β <dig> after exposure to imidacloprid. moreover, markussen and kristensen  <cit>  found that neonicotinoid resistance phenotype in danish musca domestica was correlated with reduced expression of the nachr subunit α <dig> fig.  <dig> graph bar diagram of fpkm normalized  expression level of b. tabaci nachr subunits



we investigated the occurrence of snps in unigenes encoding nachrs and possible differences between resistant and susceptible b. tabaci strains. a total of  <dig> snps were identified and were equally distributed among strains . most of them  were found in the coding regions, 19 % in the 5′utr and 29 % in the 3′utr.

the number of snps differed between the subunits of nachr with the subunits α <dig> and β <dig> showing higher variation  and subunits α <dig> and α <dig> lower variation . in subunit α <dig>  no variable site was detected; however, the shorter transcript was recovered for this subunit.

comparative polymorphism analysis identified several alleles differentially represented between insecticide resistance strains and the reference susceptible strain . twenty-seven out of the  <dig> snps were differential snps . seventeen polymorphisms concerned snps with high frequency differences between the s-gr <dig> and any of the resistant strains, which were equally affected . only five differential snps between s and r strains were in the coding region and all of them concerned synonymous substitutions.

among all transcripts, five out of the  <dig> snps annotated in the nachr sequence assembly were found in subunits β <dig> , α <dig> and α <dig>  resulted in an amino acid change . in subunit β <dig>  one non-synonymous snp  was found at the n terminal signal peptide and involved an alteration of f and s residue at position  <dig>  and two others, d/e and n/t at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  were found between transmembrane domain tm <dig> and tm <dig>  in subunit α <dig>  a nssnp  was found at position  <dig> between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  finally, an f/y change has been detected in subunit α <dig> located at  <dig> residues between lpa and lpe. none of the mutations leading to substitutions known to confer target resistance to neonicotinoids in other insect pests were detected . despite the apparent scarcity of target site resistance to neonicotinoids compared to increased detoxification, two target mutations conferring resistance to neonicotinoids have been documented in other agricultural pests  <cit> . an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of the loop b of two nachr subunits , that causes a tyrosine to serine substitution , was detected in the brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens conferring imidacloprid resistance  <cit> . the apparent scarcity of this mutation, in any other insect species including neonicotinoid resistant b. tabaci, could be explained  by the hypothesis that insects may need two mutated subunits to express resistance. another mutation in a highly conserved site within loop d of β <dig>  that causes an arginine to threonine substitution , was found in highly resistant clones of the aphid myzus persicae  <cit> . in addition, the substitutions found in our study were not located in any of the hot spot regions of the nachr subunits i.e. loops d, e and f of subunit β <dig>  or loops a, b and c of α subunits. these regions form the binding site for acetylcholine and for certain agonists including neonicotinoids  <cit> , where a number of key residues for toxin and neonicotinoid binding and selective toxicity in insect nachr have been identified by functional expression of hybrid or chimeric receptors and by docking simulations .

investigation of non - target site resistance mechanisms based on differential expression
we compared gene expressions of the susceptible and the three neonicotinoid resistant strains and performed differential expression analysis . data of three biological replicates of each condition were used in this analysis . the biological coefficients of variation  observed in this study ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and are close to those observed in genetically identical model organisms, indicating small variability between replicates  <cit> . the low intra biological replicate variation and the clear separation between susceptible and the three resistant strains provided a solid base to all subsequent analyses .

the de analysis revealed in total  <dig>  differentially expressed unigenes  in the three r strains compared to the s strain based on their tmm-fpkm . according to the expression levels of the  <dig>  de unigenes we examined the overall differential expression and detected three sub-clusters that exhibited marked differences in normalized fpkm. this clustering grouped the neonicotinoid resistant samples together. assigning known transcripts to molecular functions revealed differences in the go enrichment in the three clusters, showing that substantial differences in the transcriptional profile between resistant and susceptible strains exist .

the frequency of the up- and down-regulated unigenes was not significantly different within each strain. differential transcription was homogenously distributed between up- and down-regulated unigenes in all strains with an almost 50 % frequency:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes were up regulated and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes down regulated in gr9-is, gr4-as and the gr4-ap, respectively, compared to the susceptible s-gr <dig> strain  .fig.  <dig> graph bars and venn diagram of differentially expressed unigenes of the three resistant strains. a) distribution of differentially expressed unigenes of the resistant strains compared to the susceptible strain . in each strain up and down regulated unigenes are indicated. b) venn diagram of differentially expressed unigenes in the three resistant strains. for each venn diagram section, the numbers of transcripts differentially expressed in any insecticide resistant strain as compared to the susceptible strain are indicated



the total number of de unigenes against s-gr <dig> was unbalanced  suggesting a quantitative difference in transcription response between strains, while the lower number of de unigenes was found in gr4-ap. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were found differentially expressed in any strain, including  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes over and under transcribed in all strains, respectively. the two selected strains  showed the higher number of de unigenes with  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts specifically over-transcribed as compared to the susceptible strain . in contrast, fewer transcripts were differentially expressed in the parental strain , maintained with no selection, with only  <dig> specifically over transcribed genes. not surprisingly, the comparison between gr4-as versus gr4-ap revealed the lower number of regulated genes,  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes .

for a better understanding of the molecular functions and biological processes underlying the nature of resistance to insecticides, gene ontology term enrichment analysis was used to detect differentially expressed unigenes over or under represented specifically in each strain. here, the term enrichment results for the comparison between the de unigenes of each strain against the reference transcriptome. for the up-regulated unigenes, the go terms were generally negatively enriched in the resistant strains including terms such as response to stimulus , signalling  and cellular process  in all three resistant strains and terms such as binding  only in gr4_as. among the higher significant positively enriched go terms corresponding to up-regulated unigenes figured those related to catalytic activity such as transferase  and oxidoreductase activity  in all three resistant strains together with terms related to heterocyclic compound binding  and organic cyclic compound binding  in gr4_ap and gr9_is .fig.  <dig> go bar diagrams of over-represented and up-regulated genes. each diagram shows the first  <dig> go terms over-represented and up-regulated genes in the three resistant strains vs s-gr <dig>  and the first  <dig> go terms in gr4-as vs gr4-ap . fisher’s exact test  on the go terms



in genes with up-regulation in the gr4_as compared to its parental gr4_ap hydrolase  and peptidase activity  are among the terms related with catalytic activity , for which the frequency increased significantly . interestingly, among the down-regulated unigenes the term “response to stress”  figures among the over represented terms suggesting that genes related to stress are not only down-regulated in gr4-as compared to the parental but also represent a higher percentage of total go terms down regulated compared to the reference transcriptome .

in addition to the differential gene expression of nachr subunits between resistant and susceptible strains that was examined in the “target” paragraph, the expression profiles of other genes known to be involved in insecticide resistance were closely examined  . this de analyses includes genes related to insecticide detoxification or altered insecticide transport and sequestration.

among the  <dig> differentially over-transcribed unigenes in any r strain with a blast hit, several genes related to altered insecticide transport and sequestration were found including five cuticular proteins  and five fatty acid synthases . typically, the metabolic detoxification system in insects consists of enzymes, acting on a broad range of substrates directly to reduce their toxicity, represented by cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , and carboxylesterases  or to facilitate the excretion of hydrophobic toxic compounds by improving their hydrophilicity such as glutathione-s-transferases  and udp-glucuronosyltransferases . the strong response of the gr9-is, gr4-as and gr4-ap to insecticide selection through transcription level modifications was confirmed. among the  <dig> differentially over expressed unigenes in any r strain with a blast hit, several detoxification enzymes were represented including unigenes with orthologs in p450s , gsts , cces  and udp-glucuronosyltransferases  with some of them, namely p450s, displaying a logfc >  <dig> .

the between strains comparison displayed that, compared to the susceptible strain s-gr <dig>  the number of the up-regulated de detoxification unigenes  differed significantly  between the gr4-ap and either gr4-as or gr9-is, but not between gr9-is and gr4-as. moreover, this number is in accordance with the resistance ratios observed in the three neonicotinoid resistant strains  suggesting a quantitatively differentiated transcriptional profile related to insecticide detoxification.

gr4-ap shared all of its up regulated detox unigenes with at least one of the selected strains. the  <dig> unigenes shared by all resistant strains  should represent genes selected by neonicotinoid or other insecticides applied in the field and maintained their expression levels in gr4-ap strain even after  <dig> generations without insecticide exposure. the four significantly up regulated unigenes shared only by the gr9-is and gr4-as, which may have been commonly selected by either neonicotinoids, include three p450s and one cce with moderate logfc ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> .

investigation of detoxification genes specifically over-expressed in each resistant strain disclosed that two cces, one ugt, and  <dig> p450s  were specifically up regulated in gr9-is strain, with one cce and one p <dig> having the higher logfc . similarly,  <dig> unigenes were specifically up regulated in gr4-as including  <dig> p <dig>   <dig> ugts,  <dig> gsts and  <dig> cce. these specifically gr9-is or gr4-as up regulated unigenes reflect a genetic background related specificity, a selection agent  specificity, or a combination of both. our experimental design does not allow distinguishing between the two cases. however, taking into account that these strains should belong to the same genetic cluster  identified by microsatellites  <cit> , it is possible that the different  up-regulated unigenes in each gr9-is or gr4-as strain reflect insecticide specificity. one p <dig> unigene  was up-regulated in the gr4-as compared to both s-gr <dig> and its parental strain gr4-ap . this unigene might represent a gene with a positive transcription reaction to the selection with acetamiprid and should be studied further.

gsts metabolism as a mechanism of resistance to organochlorines, carbamates, organophosphates and pyrethroids has been reported in many arthropod species . similarly enhanced production of carboxylesterases through gene amplification and/or up-regulation has been demonstrated in several organophosphate, carbamate or pyrethroids resistant insects . however, gsts or coe have never been directly associated with neonicotinoid resistance and therefore the over-expression of the gsts and coes in the gr9_is, gr4_ap and gr4_as may have been selected as a result of contact with other xenobiotics in their environment.

among detoxification enzyme systems, p450s are the most common genes found up-regulated in a wide number of resistant insects with a subset of these p450s confirmed to be able to metabolize pesticides by functional in vitro studies in mosquitoes species reviewed by  <cit> , m. domestica  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit> , n. lugens  <cit> , h. armigera  <cit> , t. urticae  <cit>  and b. tabaci  <cit> . in addition, monooxygenase-mediated neonicotinoid resistance has been reported in several insect species including b. tabaci  <cit> , m. domestica  <cit> , m. persicae  <cit>  and d. melanogaster  <cit> . p450s expression profile is examined in more details in the following paragraphs.

detailed study of transcripts encoding putative p450s
phylogenetic study of transcripts encoding putative p450s
p450s are one of the largest super-families, playing a dominant role in plant-insect interactions and insecticide/xenobiotic metabolism. they are divided in  <dig> major clades, named cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and mitochondrial  <cit> . a variable number of p450s has been identified in insect genomes such as d. melanogaster , a. gambiae , a. aegypti , t. castaneum , a. pisum   and in recent transcriptome studies of b. dorsalis , b. oleae  and t. vaporariorum   <cit> .

a total of  <dig> contigs  were identified as p <dig> encoding genes in the b. tabaci transcriptome . to assign b. tabaci p450s to respective p <dig> clusters and families, a phylogenetic analysis was performed and, in the case of misaligning protein sequences, the closest blastp hits in the ncbi nr database were identified. in the phylogenetic analyses, only the longest  <dig> non-redundant contigs  were included together with other known insect p450s .

in this dataset, representatives of all  <dig> major insect p <dig> clades were found. the majority of b. tabaci p450s  belonged to the cyp <dig> clade,  <dig> to the cyp <dig>   <dig> to the cyp <dig>  and  <dig> to the mitochondrial clade . most of b. tabaci p450s included in cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clades cluster separately from p450s from other insect species of the phylogenetic analysis. in cyp <dig>  the separate clusters formed by b. tabaci p450s are supported by high bootstrap values and most of them form sister groups to other hemiptera p450s . however, this separation is not as clear in cyp <dig> b. tabaci p450s.

finally, we performed a bidirectional best hit  with 1: <dig> relationship between the  <dig> p450s contigs of the current study and the  <dig> p <dig> proteins from different species that were also included in the phylogenetic analysis. the bbh returned  <dig> p <dig> orthologs. for the remaining p450s, a corresponding name was assigned according to the first blast hit. .

expression levels of transcripts encoding putative p450s
the phylogenetic analyses showed that most of the  <dig> up-regulated p <dig> unigenes in any b. tabaci strain belonged to the two larger p <dig> clades cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes, respectively. three unigenes belonged to cyp <dig> and only one in the mitochondrial clade. more specifically, most of them corresponded to genes from cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families, but also from cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families . we subsequently focused on the higher over-expressed p <dig> unigenes which displayed logfc >  <dig> in at least one resistant strain. eight unigenes that belonged to clades cyp <dig> , cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  met this criterion. six unigenes  were up regulated in all resistant strains compared to the s-gr <dig> strain. one unigene, comp43434_c <dig>  was highly up-regulated only in gr9_is  and another, comp43065_c <dig>  only in the gr4_as strain  . in all cases, p <dig> expression was higher in the gr4_as maintained under acetamiprid selection, compared to its corresponding parental relaxed gr4_ap suggesting the possible contribution in acetamiprid metabolism. however, a significant difference between selected and parental strains has been found only in the comp43065_c <dig> .

unigenes comp61334_c <dig> and comp33028_c <dig> shared the higher similarity  with a putative p <dig> cyp303a1-like of a. pisum and in the phylogenetic analysis clustered together with cyp303a <dig> of a. pisum and l. striatella . they were both significantly up-regulated in the resistant strains compared to the s-gr <dig> however, comp61334_c <dig> displayed higher up regulation  compared to comp33028_c <dig> . these two specific p450s belong to clade cyp <dig> and are presumed 1: <dig> orthologs with cyp303a <dig> family members. interestingly, cyp303a <dig> is one of few highly conserved p450s found in all insect species sequenced to date, but not in daphnia pulex  <cit> . to our knowledge members of this family have never been associated with resistance to any insecticide and this is the first report for such a finding. in d. melanogaster, cyp303a <dig> has a putative external sensory development function and it has been hypothesized that it probably metabolizes a small signal molecule essential in the development and structure of external sensory organs  <cit> . whether this has to do with the sensorial capacity and avoidance of treated surface behavior remains unknown.

components 62212_c <dig> and 43434_c <dig> shared the higher similarity with cyp417b <dig> of l. stratiella . they belong to the cyp <dig> clade, with which they formed a separate cluster with other p <dig> unigenes of b. tabaci issued from this study. this cluster was a sister group with members of cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> of l. stratiella. comp62212_c <dig> was highly up-regulated in the three resistant strains  while comp43434_c <dig> was up-regulated only in the gr9-is strain .

a third unigene of clade cyp <dig>  comp43065_c <dig>  shared the higher similarity and was 1: <dig> ortholog with cyp4c <dig> of a. pisum, with which formed a distinct group separated from other cyp4c <dig> a. pisum sequences. this unigene was highly over-expressed in the gr4-as strain  and was also significantly increased level of expression after selection with acetamiprid . over-expression of members of cyp <dig> family has been found associated with a number of insecticide resistant insect strains  including neonicotinoids. for example, members of cyp <dig>  family have been found over-expressed in meam <dig> b. tabaci resistant to thiamethoxam  <cit> , or induced after treatment with imidacloprid  in aedes aegypti  <cit> , or in diaphorina citri   <cit> .

unigene comp50040_c <dig> had a significant blast hit with cyp6cm1vq of b. tabaci  and was differentially unregulated in the three resistant strains with similar, very high expression levels, compared to the susceptible strain .

cyp <dig> family p450s are widely known to be involved in metabolic resistance to pyrethroids and organophosphates in a number of insect species  including neonicotinoids  <cit> . cyp6cm <dig> was the first p <dig> isolated from an agricultural pest to be directly involved in neonicotinoid metabolism by recombinant expression. more specifically, it has been found able to metabolize imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiacloprid but not acetamiprid  <cit> . it has been also found to metabolize the chemically unrelated insecticides pymetrozine  <cit>  and pyriproxifen  <cit> . the cross resistance of acetamiprid-selected strain towards imidaclorpid  could explain the high expression levels of cyp6cm <dig> in gr4-as. additionally, the comparable expression levels with the relaxed parental strain could mean that this p <dig> was initially selected in the field  and maintained the same expression levels after six generations in absence of any selection.

for components 57969_c <dig> and 57969_c <dig> the bidirectional best hits  were respectively cyp6cx <dig> and cyp6cx <dig> of b. tabaci. these two unigenes showed comparable over-expression levels in the three resistant strains . although there is no significant difference, their expression levels slightly increase with acetamiprid selection in gr4_as compared to gr4_ap. in the phylogenetic analysis, they were grouped together with the third member of clade cyp <dig>  that has also been found highly over-expressed in this study. all three  displayed the higher similarity with the respective published sequences of b. tabaci as well as with cyp6cx <dig> and cyp6cx <dig>  cyp6cx <dig> has been associated with b. tabaci  resistance to fenvalerate, chlopyrifos, and avermectin in the field  <cit> . cyp6cx <dig> exhibited significantly higher mrna expression in a laboratory-selected thiamethoxam resistant b. tabaci meam <dig>  strain  <cit> .

all of the eight above mentioned p450s may be potentially associated with insecticide resistance and this could constitute a discrepancy compared to other insects, ie d. melanogaster where only a single p <dig>  cyp6g <dig>  is associated with neonicotinoid resistance  <cit> . however b. tabaci, is a heavily treated agricultural pest and different insecticides, of the same or different chemical groups, may select several p450s conferring unpredictable cross resistance. for example, cyp6cm <dig> the only functionally characterized p <dig> in b. tabaci, confers multiple resistant phenotypes and metabolizes some but not all neonicotinoids, as well as other insecticides from different chemical groups. our differential expression study provides a good base to select additional candidate genes for further functional characterization and validate their role in resistant phenotypes.

p <dig> expression levels in laboratory and field b. tabaci displaying different resistance phenotype using qpcr
to further support p450s role as candidate genes we studied the association between resistant phenotype and expression levels. focusing on p <dig> enzymes, we were able to set up a quantitative pcr for the seven of the eight higher up-regulated p450s  with logfc >  <dig> . using this approach, we investigated their expression levels in several selected strains , as well as in additional whiteflies sampled in the field. the levels of gene expression  in resistant strains compared to the susceptible s_gr <dig> found in qpcrs were highly correlated with those observed in rnaseq experiment  . this concordance between the transcription profiles obtained by the two techniques offered confidence to use qpcr and interpret the levels of expression of p450s in relation to neonicotinoid selection and resistance phenotype.fig.  <dig> qpcr p <dig> expression analysis of neonicotinoid resistant strains vs susceptible strain



we first examined the levels of expression in comparisons between the strains maintained under neoinicotinoid selections and their respective relaxed strains  . in general, the p <dig> expression levels were higher in the strain gr4_as, maintained under acetamiprid treatment, compared to its respective relaxed gr4_ap strain pointing out the involvement of these p450s in acetamiprid resistance. this has not been always the case for the two imidacloprid selected strains. more precisely, in these pair wise comparisons the laboratory acetamiprid treatment differentiated the expression levels for comp57969_c <dig>  comp61334_c <dig> and comp43065_c <dig> but left unchanged the levels of cyp6cm <dig>  comp57969_c <dig>  comp  <dig> and comp <dig> . on the other hand, the pair wise comparisons disclosed that the imidacloprid treatment left the levels of expression unaffected for most of the unigenes except for cyp6cm <dig> that was higher in the selected counterpart in one of the two “imidacloprid” strain pairs . this result could be explained by differences in phenotypic profiles toward the two neonicotinoids. indeed, it is worth noting that although tolerance to both neonicotinoids was constantly higher in the strains maintained under treatment , the confidence intervals  of resistance ratio  in the imidacloprid selected strains  overlap with the ci of rr of their respective relaxed strains  to both imidacloprid and acatamiprid. on the other hand, tolerance to acetamiprid and imidacloprid has been significantly higher in the acetamiprid selected strain  compared to the parental one which has been maintained under the same conditions without acetamiprid  treatment.

we subsequently scaled up and examined with qpcr the expression levels of these seven p450s, in five additional whitefly populations directly derived from the field. all populations belonged to med b. tabaci and were collected from eggplants grown in greenhouses in crete, setting the frequent application of neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, spiromesifen and pymetrozine as the common point in their treatment history. compared to the laboratory susceptible strain s_gr <dig>  their rr ranged from  <dig> to 65-fold for imidacloprid and  <dig> to  <dig> -fold for acetamiprid . for three unigenes , relative over-expression of the p450s in the field populations, measured by qpcrs, reached a 2-fold difference compared to s-gr <dig> while in unigenes comp57969_c <dig> and comp57969_c <dig> they increased  <dig> -fold. finally, in comp50040_c <dig> and comp61334_c <dig> the higher over-expression was detected with fc starting from  <dig> and reaching as high as 190-fold compared to the susceptible strain s_gr <dig> .

we then looked for the presence of correlation between resistant phenotypes and expression levels by plotting rr of all field derived and laboratory maintained strains against qpcr relative fold regulation. a positive correlation was observed between expression levels of comp61334_c <dig>  cyp6cm <dig> and comp43065_c <dig> and rr to imidacloprid and between the expression of components 57969_c <dig> and 57969_c <dig> and rr to acetamiprid. however, a significant positive correlation has been found only between the expression of comp61334_c <dig> and rr to imidacloprid, and comp57969_c <dig> and rr to acetamiprid  .fig.  <dig> linear significant regression p <dig> analysis between resistance ratios and relative gene expression. a) correlation between expression of cyp303a1-like and resistance ratio to imidacloprid, b) correlation between expression of cyp6cx <dig> and resistance ratio to acetamiprid. 



in field med  b. tabaci populations from china, levels of resistance to imidacloprid were correlated with expression levels of two p450s: cyp6cm <dig> and cyp4c <dig>  <cit> . in our rna-seq data, comp47612_c <dig> with the best blast hit to the cyp4c <dig> from b. tabaci appeared among the differentially over-expressed p450s in both acetamiprid selected and parental strain , with logfc close to  <dig>  for this reason, its expression levels were not examined in more populations by qpcr and we were are not able to assess the presence of any possible correlation with resistance levels in the greek populations. components 61334_c <dig> and 57969_c <dig> are the number one candidates for further studies, i.e. functional analysis, given their stronger positive correlation with the neonicotinoid resistant phenotype. however, the absence of significant correlation between rr and relative fold regulation cannot exclude the possibility of another p <dig> being involved in imidacloprid or acetamiprid resistance. rather, it indicates that this p <dig> is probably not the major, in terms of frequency, resistance mechanism for the given populations. this is illustrated by the case of cyp6cm <dig> whose implication in neonicotinoid resistance has been functionally demonstrated; although in the present study, no significant correlation was found. it is worth noting the total absence of a correlation between cyp6cm <dig> and rr to acetamiprid is in agreement with the fact that acetamiptid is not metabolized by this p <dig>  the unpredictable diverse range of chemistries detoxified by cyp6cm <dig>  which includes some - but not all - neonicotinoids  <cit>  as well as the unrelated chemistries of pymetrozine  <cit>  and pyriproxyfen  <cit> , exemplify the complex relationship between resistance and expression of a single p <dig>  our study clearly demonstrates that several p450s can simultaneously operate in a given resistant population and that expression profile can change between populations. this suggests that different p <dig> genes could be involved in different cases of neonicotinoid resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
our work has generated new toxicological data and genomic resources which will significantly enrich the available dataset and substantially facilitate the molecular studies in med b. tabaci. twelve libraries from three neonicotinoid resistant b. tabaci strains from greece were sequenced by illumina platform, and generated about  <dig> gbp. a reference transcriptome was built by de novo assembly and functionally annotated. the large number of sequences, obtained by the investigation of expression profile of different neonicotinoid resistant strains, provided useful insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with resistance. we further focused on the differential expression analysis and phylogenetic classification of nachr subunits and cytochrome p450s, the main genes related to neonicotinoid resistance, enabling useful genetic information of resistance mechanisms to be gained. no nachr polymorphism or differential expression of the different nachr subunits were observed among the studied strains that could be related to the resistant phenotypes. differential expression analyses disclosed a number of significantly up regulated detoxification genes , some of which specifically over-expressed in each selected strain, providing a list of putative candidate resistance genes. cyp6cm <dig> already known as a major mechanism of imidacloprid resistance in b. tabaci from crete was also deferentially expressed in the resistant strains. using quantitative qpcrs, a larger screening of field med b. tabaci from crete with known neonicotinoid phenotype was performed to associate expression levels of p450s with resistance levels. expression levels of five p450s including cyp6cm <dig> were found associated with neonicotinoid resistance, however, a significant correlation was found only in two of them, cyp <dig> and cyp6cx <dig>  with imidacloprid and acetamiprid respectively. further functional expression analysis of the genes and the encoded proteins are currently being investigated to confirm their role in resistance.
