BACKGROUND
identification of direct targets of transcription factors  is a necessary step to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in living cells. although traditional single-gene experiments  remain most reliable in testing direct targets, there is also a need for high-throughput approaches that would allow one to detect the majority of most important target genes. two experimental methods contribute most to such a high-throughput search of target genes: gene expression profiling of tf-manipulated cells and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay. however, expression profiling may yield many genes that respond indirectly, whereas chip may yield many non-functional binding sites, i.e., binding sites that were detected by chip, but were not functional for transcriptional regulation. therefore, the state of the art is to take the intersection between these two sets of genes  and consider it as a set of tentative target genes   <cit> . however, the intersection of these sets of genes may still contain numerous false positives â€“ genes that respond indirectly and have non-functional chip-binding sites. another problem is that there is no method to statistically quantify the proportion of false positives in the set of ttgs.

to address these issues, we developed a new method to identify ttgs, which reduces the proportion of false positives by applying the false discovery rate  criterion to individual groups of genes that differ in the direction, magnitude, and time of response to the manipulation of a tf. the computational strategy included optimization of scores of potential function  of binding sites that separated best the training and control sets of genes, and estimation of the fdr from the frequency distribution of spf among control genes .

this method is applied here to the mouse pou5f <dig>  gene which is the major tf that controls self-renewal and pluripotency in es cells  <cit> . lists of potential target genes of pou5f <dig> were recently generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation  and gene expression profiling of cells with suppressed pou5f <dig> transcription  <cit> . most studies used shrna for pou5f <dig> suppression  <cit> , but these methods can generate off-target effects, and gene repression is often weak. in these studies, expression profiling was carried out with  <dig> day intervals which limited the temporal resolution in detecting gene response. matoba et al.  <cit>  increased the reliability of prediction of pou5f <dig> primary targets by using a tet-inducible system to suppress pou5f <dig>  this method eliminated false-positives related to potential off-target effects of shrna used to suppress pou5f <dig> in earlier studies. however, gene expression was still measured in  <dig> day intervals, and microarrays did not include all the mouse genes. in this paper we present a new microarray experiment with the same tet-inducible system but with multiple time points within  <dig> hr to capture early responses to pou5f <dig> suppression. these data were analyzed together with published genome-wide chip data  <cit> . we found that most ttgs of pou5f <dig> in es cells were activated by pou5f <dig> and only a limited number of genes were suppressed, which implies that the main function of pou5f <dig> binding to promoters of target genes is activation of gene expression rather than suppression. the same method was then applied to find target genes of sox <dig> and nanog based mostly on previously published data. a list of data sets used in this study is shown in additional file  <dig>  because the interaction between pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog is supported by immunoprecipitation, functional analysis, and co-localization of binding sites  <cit> , we explored the relationships between their target genes. these results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of pluripotency maintenance in es cells.

RESULTS
 <dig>  time course microarray data
we previously reported time course microarray data of mouse es cells, in which the level of pou5f <dig> expression was reduced in tetracycline -controllable manner  <cit> . global gene expression profiles were obtained from es samples at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr  <cit> . to obtain earlier effects of pou5f <dig> repression, here we used the same zhbtc <dig> es cells  <cit>  and measured the global gene expression profiles at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr after adding tet. because the  <dig> hr time point was present in both experiments, the microarray data at  <dig> hr was used to merge two data sets  . in zhbtc <dig> es cells, the level of pou5f <dig> mrna was reduced to one-thirds within  <dig> hrs after adding tet, whereas the same reduction of pou5f <dig> protein level was observed in  <dig> hrs . the cells show no morphological changes associated with differentiation during the first  <dig> hrs after adding tet, but the cells begin to be flattened after  <dig> hrs  <cit> . we found  <dig> genes with a statistically significant  response to pou5f <dig> suppression . a subset of these genes with >  <dig> fold change  overlapped reasonably  with gene lists identified earlier using pou5f <dig> knockdown with shrna  <cit>  . the majority  of  <dig> genes common between our study and the published study  <cit> , changed their expression in the same direction after pou5f <dig> suppression, which was significantly greater than expected from random matches  . discrepancies between data sets may be explained by off-target effects of shrna in earlier studies and by a larger coverage of genes in our microarrays. genes that were previously considered targets of pou5f <dig>  <cit> , but had no response to pou5f <dig> suppression in our experiments , were not artifacts of microarray design, because the majority of these genes  had functional oligos in our microarray that showed statistically significant differential expression in earlier experiments  <cit> .

although several methods to analyze time course microarray data have been reported , we decided to characterize the pattern of gene expression in a simpler way by  <dig> major parameters: the time of response when it exceeded  <dig> -fold change threshold, and the magnitude of response measured by the maximum logratio of expression change  . the scatterplot of magnitude of response versus time of response for all genes with statistically significant change of expression  shows the global picture of gene expression change after manipulation of the pou5f <dig> . the initial response to pou5f <dig> suppression  is characterized mostly by down-regulation of many genes. it is followed by the wave of gene up-regulation which becomes more intense after  <dig> hr. genes with a strongest response had a tendency to be activated or suppressed earlier than genes with a weaker response. earliest effects were suppression of tfs foxd <dig>  mybl <dig>  zic <dig>  klf <dig>  and nr0b <dig>  later but still within  <dig> hr we observed activation of tfs that are expressed in trophectoderm . interestingly, genes that are considered important for pluripotency in es cells  responded with a considerable delay .

gene expression profiling of es cells after suppression of sox <dig> was carried out using the same protocol  as the experiment on pou5f <dig>  <cit> . thus, results on sox <dig>  were fully compatible with that for pou5f <dig> experiment.

the proportion of genes that responded to the suppression of pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> increased in a similar manner over time , and the proportion of common genes also increased with time . principal component analysis  showed that gene expression response to pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> suppression was similar when projected on the first principal component  . pc <dig> seems to represent a transition of es cells from a pluripotent state to more differentiated states because it is associated with a decreased expression of es cell specific genes , and increased expression of genes related to differentiation . the second principal component  represented minor fraction of genes that responded differentially to the suppression of sox <dig> and pou5f <dig> .

we did not have -inducible nanog es cells, and thus had to use the following three experimental results:  time course  of shrna-mediated knockdown in es cells  <cit> ,  shrna-mediated knockdown of nanog in es cells  <cit> , and  stable over-expression of nanog performed in our laboratory . the first data set was analyzed in a way similar to the pou5f <dig> data set; however because the experiment was done without replications we combined data points  as replications for statistical analysis . combined data points showed similar gene expression profiles based on principal component analysis  . in the latter  <dig> data sets, we classified genes only based on expression change , and used these classes for estimating the fdr . when we combined these  <dig> data sets, the direction of gene response was inverted for the experiment with nanog over-expression to make it compatible with other data, and genes showing contradictory change were ignored. because data on nanog was obtained with different methods than on pou5f <dig> and sox <dig>  it should be interpreted with caution.

it is important to note that genes affected by the alterations of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog expression contain not only primary  targets of these tfs, but also secondary/tertiary targets as shown previously  <cit> .

 <dig>  data set of genome-wide chromatin ip
we used genome-wide chip data of pou5f <dig> and nanog, published by loh et al.  <cit> . all raw data were remapped to the mouse genome sequences and analyzed with the genome annotation using components of cisview software, which includes information on the transcription start sites   <cit> . as we pointed out in our previous work  <cit> , some known pou5f <dig> target genes were missed in the pou5f1-target gene list assembled by loh et al.  <cit>  partly due to the use of a stringent criteria . we therefore decided to use both pou5f <dig> and nanog chip data, when we searched for pou5f <dig> target or nanog target. significant co-localization of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog binding sites have been clearly shown recently by chip-chip analysis  <cit> . in mouse, the strength of nanog binding  was positively associated with the strength of pou5f <dig> binding to the same region according to our re-analysis of chip data  <cit>  . our analysis of tf binding motifs in dna regions identified by chip  <cit>  showed that chip-nanog regions  had a high abundance of oct-sox composite binding motifs also known as hmg/pou cassettes  <cit>  . this finding also confirms co-localization of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog binding sites. moreover, chip-nanog regions that did not overlap with any chip-pou5f <dig> regions also had an increased abundance of oct-sox composite binding motifs . this indicates that nanog binding can be used as additional evidence of pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> binding and vise versa. therefore, it is reasonable to use a combination of pou5f <dig> and nanog chip data for finding pou5f <dig> targets. for example, in the original chip-pet analysis by loh et al., only binding sites with â‰¥  <dig> ditags were considered reliable  <cit> . in contrast, in our modified approach we could utilize pou5f <dig> binding sites with only  <dig> or  <dig> ditags on condition that they had additional nanog ditags. this approach increases the sensitivity of finding tf binding sites, but it may have a down side of possibly being too inclusive.

we also used genome-wide chip data for sox <dig> obtained from human es cells  <cit> . however, the human chip data were analyzed separately and used only to provide additional gene list for sox <dig> targets .

 <dig>  evaluating the chip-binding sites with a score of potential function 
presence of a chip-binding site of a tf in the promoter of a gene is not yet an evidence of transcription regulation because tf binding may be related to other cellular functions or may be not functional at all. to evaluate the potential functionality of pou5f <dig> binding sites in transcription regulation we developed a score of potential function , which was estimated using an ad hoc equation:

  spf = Â·c + dÂ·x, 

where n <dig> and n <dig> are the number of chip-pet ditags for pou5f <dig> and nanog , respectively, d is the distance from binding region to tss, x =  <dig> for cpg-rich regions and  <dig> otherwise, and a, b, c, and d are adjustable parameters. as we discussed above, we used data on nanog binding so that it can provide additional evidence of binding site function. expression levels of nanog changed >  <dig> hr after pou5f <dig> suppression; thus, the training sets did not contain genes which responded to pou5f <dig> suppression indirectly via the effect of nanog, and the use of nanog binding could not affect spf in favor of indirect effects. the spf was optimized to best separate between the training set of genes that responded to pou5f <dig> suppression and control set of genes that were not affected by pou5f <dig>  we used  <dig> training sets of genes that were down-regulated  and up-regulated , respectively, by at least  <dig> fold and responded non-transiently to pou5f <dig> suppression within the time window from  <dig> to  <dig> hr . genes that responded earlier than  <dig> hr may have been affected by other factors besides the gradually decreasing amount of pou5f <dig> protein, and genes that responded later than  <dig> hr are more likely to be affected indirectly. the control set of genes  contained genes with medium- or high-quality promoters  <cit>  represented by a responsive oligo in the microarray, which did not respond to pou5f <dig> and had no differential expression between es and ts cells  <cit> . adjustable parameters were changed to maximize the t-statistics for the difference in average spf values between the training and control set of genes . to avoid circular reference by estimating spf for genes in the training and control set with parameters optimized for the same genes, we used the bootstrap resampling method  <cit> . scores for pou5f <dig> binding sites were positively affected by the number of chip ditags and negatively affected by the distance from tss and by cpg richness of the sequence . down-regulated genes were more widely separated from control genes by their average spf than up-regulated genes based on t statistics . characteristics of binding sites with highest spf for each gene are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

 <dig>  identification of tentative target genes  for pou5f1
we developed a novel algorithm to identify direct targets of a tf by first separating genes that responded to tf-manipulation into groups according to their expression patterns: direction , magnitude  and time  of response. we then applied the fdr criterion to each group individually . genes with transient response were handled separately from genes with constitutive response. fdr was estimated in two steps: first p-values were estimated for each gene on the basis of the spf of a binding site in the promoter and cumulative probability distribution of spf for binding sites in promoters of control genes. the probability distribution of spf in the control set of genes was approximated by a linear function loge = a + bÂ·x , and then the regression was used to calculate p-values. fdr was then calculated in each group of genes as described  <cit> . numerical examples showing the advantage of this approach are given in the methods section.

assuming that we can tolerate up to 20% of false positives, we set fdr threshold to  <dig>  and identified  <dig> ttgs of pou5f <dig> . the list of genes included the majority of known pou5f <dig> targets , which supports the validity of our analysis. although one-fifths of these ttgs are in theory false positives due to fdr â‰¤  <dig> , we believe that this is the best result we can obtain with the current technology and uniform data analysis applied to all the genes. some genes with strong response to pou5f <dig> were not included in the list of ttgs , because the fdr values were slightly above the accepted threshold. we, therefore, assembled an additional list of  <dig> genes  that are likely to be targets of pou5f <dig> although they did not pass our statistical criteria. these genes had either relatively low fdr values or additional evidence of their regulation by pou5f <dig> 

a list of target genes identified in this paper matched reasonably with lists of genes identified in earlier studies. of  <dig> ttgs identified for pou5f <dig>   <dig> genes overlapped with a list of genes identified in matoba et al.  <cit> , and  <dig> genes overlapped with a list of genes identified in loh et al.  <cit>  . ttgs that were identified in earlier studies, but not identified in the current study fell into two categories:  ttgs that had weak binding sites; and  ttgs that did not respond significantly to pou5f <dig> manipulation in our experiment, as judged by the distribution of a simple score estimated as a product of spf and absolute magnitude of gene expression response to pou5f <dig> suppression . the scores for ttgs identified in this paper were substantially higher than those for non-matching genes from the earlier papers, indicating that the current list of ttgs was high quality. furthermore, there was significant overlap between ttgs identified in the current work and ttgs identified in the previous meta-analysis of gene expression in es cells  <cit> : out of  <dig> genes with current gene symbols,  <dig> genes were identified as ttgs of pou5f <dig> in the current work.

interestingly, we found that pou5f <dig> functions mostly as a positive regulator of target gene expression in es cells: among  <dig> ttgs of pou5f <dig>  the majority  were down-regulated after pou5f <dig> suppression and only  <dig> ttgs were up-regulated . this was a surprise, because pou5f <dig> is thought to suppress the expression of genes associated with cell differentiation. to address this issue, we analyzed  <dig> pou5f1-ttgs and  <dig> additional ttgs  based on gene ontology  terms  and literature  and found  <dig> major categories for positive regulation and  <dig> category for negative regulation . one notable category among genes activated by pou5f <dig> was the "suppressors of cell differentiation," which was comprised of many known and hypothetical transcriptional repressors and signaling repressors . these include polycomb genes such as suz <dig> and phc <dig>  which are known to repress genes associated with differentiation in es cells  <cit> . zinc finger tfs are also known as suppressors of gene expression  <cit> . for example, klf <dig> directly suppresses the expressions of p <dig>  <cit> , hdc   <cit> , and sp <dig>  <cit> , although klf <dig> also activates a number of genes, including lefty <dig>  <cit> . some of zinc finger tfs activated by pou5f <dig>  have krab domains, which are involved in gene-silencing and heterochromatin formation  <cit> . some chromatin remodeling proteins are also known for suppressing gene expressions  <cit> . for example, dnmt3b is a de novo dna methyltransferase which can contribute to transcription silencing, although the gene seems dispensable for pluripotency maintenance  <cit> . cdyl is a transcriptional co-repressor which is active via its coa-pocket domain  <cit> . tfs with jumonji domain  function as histone demethylase and modulate the chromatin status  <cit> . inhibitors of helix-loop-helix tf binding  are also included in the list. the "suppression of cell differentiation" category  also includes a number of inhibitors of cell signaling, such as phosphatases , inhibitors of tgfbeta signaling , wnt inhibitor sfrp <dig>  and igf inhibitor igfbp <dig>  proteases are also included in the list: htra <dig> inactivates tgfbeta signaling possibly via modification of ecm  <cit> ; and ubiquitination-related genes  may suppress gene activity via degradation of transcription-activation complexes. the pou5f <dig>  thus, seems to suppress the expression of genes associated with cell differentiation by positively regulating the "suppressors of cell differentiation."

other groups of ttgs activated directly by pou5f <dig> are "major pluripotency-related genes", "genes associated with cell proliferation", and "genes associated with morphogenesis" . the first group includes mostly known targets of pou5f <dig>  pluripotency-related genes, foxd <dig> and sall <dig>  which are known for nanog dependency  <cit> , were also ttgs of pou5f <dig>  because in our experiments they responded to pou5f <dig> suppression long before the change of expression of nanog. germ line specific gene dppa <dig>  was another new ttg of pou5f <dig>  the group of "genes associated with cell proliferation" included major regulators of cell cycle , dna metabolism/repair genes, growth factors, and others, which are consistent with the earlier report  <cit> . mybl <dig>  and myc promote cell transition from g <dig> phase to s phase, and therefore contribute to the unique cell cycle structure  in es cells  <cit> . the regulation of es cell proliferation by tcl <dig> has also been demonstrated previously  <cit> . surprisingly, the group of "genes associated with morphogenesis", which included many embryonic growth factors, receptors, tfs, and signal transduction genes, appeared positively regulated by pou5f <dig>  possibly, pou5f <dig> is not the only transcription regulator of these genes because many of them remain active in developing embryo even after full silencing of pou5f <dig> 

in contrast, a small number of ttgs labeled as "differentiation-related genes" , was negatively regulated by pou5f <dig>  it has been shown that pou5f <dig> can block the transcriptional auto-activation of cdx <dig> by cdx <dig> protein  <cit> . although these genes have pou5f <dig> binding sites identified by chip, the functionality of these sites as transcription repressors has not been confirmed experimentally. if these binding sites are indeed involved in repression of transcription, then this mechanism may complement other more generic mechanisms of repression of genes associated with differentiation. for example, arrb <dig>  cdx <dig>  cidea, eomes, fgf <dig>  and gadd45g have bivalent chromatin domains   <cit> , and thus can be repressed via polycomb genes.

thus, the main function of pou5f <dig> binding to promoters is activation of target genes, whereas suppression of genes related to cell differentiation is mostly indirect and mediated by specialized gene silencing mechanisms, many components of which are activated directly by pou5f <dig>  the pou5f <dig> may have additional molecular functions besides direct regulation of transcription ; however these effects are beyond the scope of this paper. pou5f <dig> can interact directly with transcriptional repression complexes in es cells  <cit> , but it is not clear to what extent this interaction involves sequence-specific binding of pou5f <dig> to dna.

 <dig>  identification of target genes for sox <dig> and nanog
target genes for sox <dig> and nanog were identified using the same strategy as for pou5f <dig> . data sources used for this analysis are summarized in additional file  <dig>  many ttgs of sox <dig> and nanog overlapped with ttgs of pou5f <dig> . similarly to pou5f <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog seem to function as activators of gene expression rather than repressors:  <dig> genes  were activated by sox <dig> , and  <dig> genes  were activated by nanog  .

we also assembled a table of additional ttgs of sox <dig> based on human es cell data, because chip data for sox <dig> in mouse es cells are not available and we might have missed important genes. we used chip data for sox <dig> in human es cells  <cit>  and microarray data in mouse es cells after sox <dig> suppression   <cit> . a list of genes is available in additional file  <dig> for readers who are interested in these additional genes, but these genes were not used for further analyses described below. a gene list may contain a proportion of false positives larger than 20%, because the target genes of these tfs do not necessary overlap between human and mouse es cells  <cit> .

 <dig>  common target genes of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog
it has been shown that pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog proteins co-occupy promoters of a substantial portion of their target genes in the analysis of chip-chip data of human es cells  <cit> . consistent with this notion, new lists of ttgs identified in this paper based on both chip data and expression profiling data showed that out of  <dig> combined ttgs of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog, only  <dig> genes  were affected by one of these tfs; other ttgs were affected by  <dig> or  <dig> tfs . the majority of ttgs were down-regulated after suppression of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and/or nanog , very few were upregulated , and some had a mixed response  .

one of the concerns was that these common ttgs could have been erroneously identified, because pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog affect the expression of each other and thereby indirectly affects downstream gene expressions. to eliminate possible indirect effects, we used our observation that manipulation of each of these  <dig> genes changed the expression of other genes with a substantial delay , which makes it possible to separate gene networks affected by each tf. we plotted another venn diagram where effects of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog were counted only if target genes responded before the response time of other members within this group of  <dig> major tfs associated with es cell pluripotency . even after removal of these possible indirect effects, correlation between effects of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog remained strong.

we also examined a possibility that these co-regulations occurred by chance. for example, the number of genes activated by both pou5f <dig> and sox <dig>  was significantly higher than expected from permutation of  <dig> genes with strong binding sites ; expected overlap was only  <dig>  genes . permutation was limited to genes with strong binding sites to avoid the possibility that apparent correlation between effects of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog simply resulted from the use of the same chip dataset for selecting ttgs for these tfs. the number of genes activated by both pou5f <dig> and nanog  was also significantly higher than expected from permutation . in contrast, co-activation of genes by sox <dig> and nanog appeared non-significant: only  <dig> genes were activated by both tfs versus expected  <dig>  genes . effect of pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> was similar not only in activation but also in suppression of target genes. the number of genes suppressed by both pou5f <dig> and sox <dig>  was statistically higher than expected from permutation . these genes included cell-cycle suppressor gadd45g, fgf-signaling genes , and tfs eomes and dmrt <dig> 

expression of ttgs of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog may be regulated by other factors as well. to distinguish genes that are predominantly regulated by pou5f <dig> and nanog, we analyzed the expression of ttgs in lineage committed cell types reported previously: mouse trophoblast stem cells , neural stem cells , and embryonic fibroblasts   <cit> . pou5f <dig> and nanog are not expressed in these cell types. however, sox <dig> is expressed in ns and ts , but is not expressed in mef. we expected that genes that are predominantly regulated by pou5f <dig> and nanog will change their expressions in these cell types in the same direction as in the es with suppressed expression of pou5f <dig> or nanog. out of  <dig> ttgs,  <dig> were consistently down-regulated and  <dig> were consistently up-regulated in lineage-committed cells . in the former group  <dig> % genes were down-regulated after suppression of either pou5f <dig>  or nanog , and in the latter group only  <dig> % genes were up-regulated after suppression of pou5f <dig>  or nanog . in total, we found  <dig> ttgs that were expected to be predominantly regulated by pou5f <dig> and nanog, and the majority of them  were activated by these tfs .

 <dig>  differential effects of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog on their ttgs
although pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog cooperate strongly in their effects on target genes, their roles may not be equal. for example, sox <dig> is dispensable in activation of several known gene expression enhancers with oct-sox composite binding site  <cit> . thus, we wanted to check if the same was true for other genes activated by pou5f <dig>  among  <dig> ttgs of pou5f <dig> that were down-regulated after pou5f <dig> suppression,  <dig> were not affected by sox <dig> suppression, and  <dig> responded more weakly and with delay compared to their response to pou5f <dig> suppression . some genes from the latter set may be affected by sox <dig> only indirectly via pou5f <dig> suppression; however testing this hypothesis would require further study. only  <dig> genes responded to sox <dig> suppression more strongly and faster compared with their response to pou5f <dig> suppression .

similarly, out of  <dig> ttgs of pou5f <dig> that were down-regulated after pou5f <dig> suppression,  <dig> were not affected by nanog, and  <dig> responded to nanog suppression weaker and with delay compared to their response to pou5f <dig> suppression . small number of genes responding to nanog manipulation can be partially explained by the fact that suppression of nanog did not change the expression of pou5f <dig> in both knockdown and overexpression experiments, and therefore, there were no indirect effects mediated by pou5f <dig>  only  <dig> genes responded to nanog suppression more strongly and faster compared to their response to pou5f <dig> suppression . genes that responded more strongly  to nanog suppression compared to pou5f <dig> suppression  were enriched in genes associated with growth factor activity . thus, although pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog cooperate in activation of ttgs, pou5f <dig> plays the major role in this cooperation, whereas sox <dig> and nanog generally have a weaker effect. however, there were exceptions from this general rule because some genes were affected more strongly by sox <dig> or nanog than by pou5f <dig> 

examples of differential effects of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  or nanog on their ttgs are given in fig.  <dig>  many suppressors of cell differentiation  were activated by pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> but not by nanog, whereas several genes associated with es cell pluripotency  were activated by pou5f <dig> and nanog but not by sox <dig>  some pluripotency-related genes  and utf1) were activated solely by pou5f <dig>  germline markers dppa <dig>  and dazl were activated by pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> but either suppressed  or not affected  by nanog. trophectoderm marker cdx <dig> was suppressed by pou5f <dig> and nanog, whereas another trophectoderm marker eomes was suppressed by pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> but not by nanog. genes associated with morphogenesis, lefty <dig> and nodal, were suppressed by sox <dig> and nanog but activated by pou5f <dig>  differential effect of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog on target genes may be important for embryo patterning and regulation of metabolism.

some differential effects were observed on quantitative level only. for example, ttgs of sox <dig> that were down-regulated more strongly  after sox <dig> suppression compared to pou5f <dig> suppression  were enriched in genes associated with neural differentiation , and first  <dig> of these genes were over-expressed in ns compared to es, according to published data  <cit> . interestingly, additional ttgs of sox <dig> that had no pou5f <dig> or nanog binding sites, were also enriched in genes that were over-expressed in ns  . these observations are consistent with a known role of sox <dig> in neural differentiation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel algorithm to evaluate the statistical significance of direct downstream target genes for a tf. the method uses two data inputs: genome-wide time-course expression profiling data after the manipulation of tf expression level; and genome-wide chip data. we have applied this method to key pluripotency genes â€“ pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog, and identified their ttgs in es cells. because the majority of ttgs were activated and only a few of them were suppressed, we conclude for the first time that the main function of pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog when they are bound to promoters is activation of gene expression rather than suppression. thus, the role of these tfs in suppression of genes associated with differentiation is mostly indirect and is mediated via specialized gene silencing mechanisms. this idea is supported by our observation that transcription of many components of these silencing pathways is directly activated by pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog. these  <dig> genes may have additional molecular functions that are not related to binding to the promoters of target genes, but these functions cannot be inferred from chip data and therefore require different methods of analysis.
