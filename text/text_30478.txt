BACKGROUND
mycobacteria appear to have numerous molecular pathways responsible for their inherent resistance to reactive oxygen species   <cit> . in most bacteria, oxidative stress induces a global regulator, oxyr, that induces detoxifying enzymes such as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase  and catalase/hydroperoxidase i   <cit> . during normal aerobic metabolism bacteria produce superoxide  that is converted to hydrogen peroxide  and oxygen  by superoxide dismutase and h2o <dig> is converted to water  and o <dig> by katg  <cit>  or ahpc  <cit> . the two superoxide dismutase  genes present in mycobacteria, soda and sodc, have been suggested to play a role in resistance to ros. a sodc mutant is more susceptible to ros, including hydrogen peroxide , and displays a defect in growth within activated macrophages  <cit> . the soda gene has been down-regulated by antisense methods, resulting in increased sensitivity to h2o <dig>  <cit> . mycobacteria also express a catalase, katg, that affects resistance to ros produced by nadph oxidase activity in activated macrophages  <cit> . other pathways must play an important role in resistance of m. tuberculosis to oxidative stress because oxyr is inactive  <cit> , katg is absent or mutated in numerous human clinical isolates  <cit>  and ahpc is expressed at very low levels  <cit> .

similar to ros, there are several pathways involved in mycobacterial resistance to reactive nitrogen species , including noxr <dig>  noxr <dig>  <cit> , dlat  <cit> , msra  <cit> , cysh  <cit> , dna repair, protein degradation in the proteasome and flavin cofactor synthesis  <cit> . in addition to its role in resistance to ros, the mycobacterial ahpc is also involved in resistance to the rns peroxynitrite, but not nitric oxide  <cit> . peroxynitrite is produced by sod in the presence of h2o <dig> and nitric oxide, linking these two important mechanisms of oxidative stress-mediated cell death  <cit> . this observation may help to explain the inherent resistance of m. tuberculosis to peroxynitrite as compared to less pathogenic mycobacteria  <cit> .

bioluminescence systems can protect cells against ros  <cit>  through a catalase-like reaction between the electron donating ros and oxidized luciferase-bound flavin mononucleotide, producing water and light  <cit> . the similarity of luciferases to oxidases  <cit>  suggests that bioluminescence systems could have evolved from oxygen defense mechanisms  <cit> . during genetic analysis of factors that affect macrophage infection, we identified the m. marinum mel <dig> locus, which displays similarity to lux genes involved in bioluminescence  <cit> . in the current study, more detailed analysis of the genes in the mel <dig> locus suggests functional similarity between mel <dig> and bioluminescence systems. based on this similarity, we asked whether the m. marinum mel <dig> locus is involved in resistance of mycobacteria to oxidative stress. we constructed an m. marinum mutant that carries a transposon insertion in the first gene in the mel <dig> locus, melf, by allelic exchange and demonstrated that this mutant displays increased susceptibility to both ros and rns. since this mutation may have polar effects on downstream genes, we complemented this mutant with two constructs, one that carries the melf gene alone and another with the entire mel <dig> locus. the melf mutant defect is partially complemented by melf alone, but fully complemented by the entire mel <dig> locus. we recently found that the mel <dig> mutant displays a defect for growth in activated macrophages that is alleviated by the presence of either ros scavengers or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors  <cit> , suggesting that the mel <dig> mutant is more susceptible to ros and rns than wild type bacteria. the data obtained in the current study support and extend these observations through demonstration that the mel <dig> locus plays a role in susceptibility to several different compounds that produce ros and rns in laboratory media. our results indicate that the m. marinum mel <dig> locus is the first of a newly identified class of genes with similarity to bioluminescence genes involved in resistance to both ros and rns.

RESULTS
similarity of the genes in the mel <dig> locus to bioluminescence genes
the initial analysis of the genes present in the mel <dig> locus indicated that the melf, melg and melh genes display similarity to luxa  <cit> , luxg  <cit>  and luxh  <cit>  genes involved in bioluminescence  <cit> . in order to obtain a better understanding of these findings and explore the possibility of additional functional similarities, we conducted detailed analysis of the conserved motifs present within the melf-melk genes. we first conducted an ncbi conserved domain  search with melf. we obtained a 100% alignment  for the  <dig> amino acid  bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase motif . this motif is conserved in all bacterial luciferase genes, including the luxa and luxb genes from vibrio harveyi, for which crystal structures have been previously determined  <cit> . many of the residues responsible for catalytic activity and fmnh <dig> binding for luxa and luxb are also present in melf  <cit> , suggesting that these proteins have related activities. analysis of the relatedness of melf to luxa and luxb places melf on an independent branch , indicating it is nearly equally related to both, with a slightly closer relationship to luxa than luxb.

analysis of conserved domains within melg-melk also demonstrated striking similarity to genes involved in bioluminescence . functional domains that display similarity to luxc , luxd , luxg  and luxh  were identified. although there is no clear homologue of luxe within the mel <dig> locus, melh carries domains with similarity to aminopeptidases and lysophospholipases, suggesting that this protein could serve in the role of both the transferase and synthetase activities found in the lux pathway. additional putative functional domains were present within melg, melh and meli that were not present within the lux genes. some of these differences may be due to differences in substrate specificity between these pathways and may help to explain why mycobacteria are not luminescent. with the differences and similarities between the mel <dig> and lux proteins in mind, we constructed a working model for the putative biochemical roles of the proteins encoded by the mel <dig> locus . since mycobacteria face significant ros during infections, we reasoned that a role in protection against ros could help to explain the presence of conserved domains between the mel <dig> locus and bioluminescent systems.

m. marinum mel <dig> mutant and complementing strains
an m. marinum mel <dig> mutant was constructed by in vitro mutagenesis of the mel <dig> locus with mini-mu and replacement of the wild type gene by allelic exchange  <cit> . we confirmed the presence of the appropriate insertion in the melf gene  by southern analysis and pcr. since insertion mutations can have polar effects on downstream genes and the genes in the mel <dig> locus are very closely juxtaposed to each other, we asked whether the insertion in melf affects transcript levels for the melg-melk genes. rt-pcr with primer pairs upstream of the melf insertion mutation produces relatively similar levels of product for the m. marinum melf mutant and wild type strains, but rt-pcr with primer pairs within the downstream genes produce less product in the melf mutant than the wild type strain . these observations suggest that the mu insertion in melf has polar effects on downstream genes and full complementation of this mutation will most likely require the entire mel <dig> locus. since the luxa gene plays a pivotal role in bioluminescence and similar genes, including melf, are thought to be oxidoreductases, it is possible that only the melf gene will be required for the role of mel <dig> in resistance to ros. in order to differentiate between these possibilities we complemented the m. marinum melf mutant with both melf alone  and the entire mel <dig> locus  .

the mycobacterial mel <dig> locus affects susceptibility to ros
we first compared the ros susceptibility of wild type m. marinum with that of m. tuberculosis and the non-pathogenic mycobacterial species m. smegmatis . we found that m. marinum displays similar levels of resistance to h2o <dig> as m. tuberculosis at various concentrations and times of treatment. in contrast, m. smegmatis is readily killed, even at  <dig> mm h2o <dig> where the pathogenic strains are nearly completely resistant . interestingly, we found that a mel <dig> mutant that carries an insertion in the melf gene is much more susceptible than wild type m. marinum to h2o <dig> . this difference is more pronounced at  <dig> mm  than at  <dig> mm . resistance to h2o <dig> cannot be restored to the mel <dig> mutant with the melf gene alone, even expressed from a plasmid , but can be restored by a single copy integrated plasmid carrying the entire mel <dig> locus . in contrast, no difference in the growth rate or survival of these mycobacterial strains in standard laboratory medium without h2o <dig> is observed . these observations suggests that the melf gene alone is not sufficient to confer resistance to h2o <dig>  and that the melf insertion mutation has polar effects on downstream genes involved in h2o <dig> resistance.

we further probed the role of the mel <dig> locus in resistance to ros through the use of two additional ros generating compounds, cumene hydroperoxide and t-booh. both of these compounds are organic peroxides that produce ros inside the bacterial cell, but are more stable in aqueous solutions than h2o <dig>  organic peroxides decompose to alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals in addition to h2o <dig>  <cit> . the mel <dig> mutant was more susceptible to both cumene hydroperoxide and t-booh than wild type m. marinum . interestingly, at the two-hour time point partial complementation of the resistance defect was observed, but once again, the entire mel <dig> locus confers wild type resistance levels. these observations indicate that the mel <dig> locus plays a role in resistance to ros, including the diverse radicals produced by organic peroxides.

the mel <dig> locus affects susceptibility to rns
since the mel <dig> locus plays a role in resistance to ros, it is also possible that it will affect resistance to rns. the ros and rns pathways are linked in the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite  <cit> . because of the importance of rns in protection against mycobacterial infections  <cit> , pathways that affect susceptibility are likely to be important for pathogenesis. we examined the susceptibility of the mel <dig> mutant to acidified nano <dig>  which is a source of nitric oxide  <cit> , and snap, which releases nitric oxide under neutral ph in the presence of trace metals  <cit> . similar to ros, the mel <dig> mutant displays greater susceptibility than wild type m. marinum to rns  and this phenotype can be complemented partially by the melf gene alone and completely by the entire mel <dig> locus .

the mel <dig> locus affects susceptibility to the combination of ros and rns
since these observations suggest that the mel <dig> locus is involved in resistance of mycobacteria to both ros and rns, we examined whether the presence of both ros and rns simultaneously would have a more dramatic effect upon this mutant. interestingly, the mel <dig> mutant is much more susceptible to treatment with both h2o <dig> and snap together than either compound alone . these observations suggest that the mel <dig> mutant plays a role in susceptibility to both ros and rns, whether treated with them together, as most likely occurs in vivo, or separately.

discussion
the molecular mechanisms of mycobacterial resistance to ros and rns have been an area of intense investigation and suggest that there are multiple pathways involved in resistance  <cit> . in the current study, we identified a novel set of genes in the mel <dig> locus that play a role in resistance to both ros and rns. as shown in our previous studies, this locus is also important for survival in activated macrophages and virulence in the mouse footpad model of infection  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a mycobacterial pathway that impacts susceptibility to both of these reactive species. since rns and ros are linked through the production of peroxynitrite from nitric oxide and superoxide  <cit> , the mel <dig> system may be specifically involved in resistance to this reactive species. the presence of the mel <dig> locus in the tuberculosis complex and m. marinum  <cit>  and absence in avirulent mycobacteria that are more susceptible to peroxynitrite  <cit>  supports this concept.

the similarity of the mel <dig> locus to bioluminescence systems at the amino acid level and the presence of conserved domains between them are intriguing observations. these data are particularly interesting in light of the recent observations that bioluminescent systems can protect cells against oxidative stress  <cit> . in search of a biological role for bioluminescence in bacteria that would explain how such an energy-consuming system could have developed evolutionarily, it has been proposed that these pathways protect against ros generated in an aerobic atmosphere  <cit> . interestingly, it has been observed that ros play a pivotal role in host-symbiont interactions with bioluminescent bacteria  <cit> . at present, our model for the biochemical function of mel <dig>  is purely hypothetical and is in need of more experimental support, but the large number of conserved functional domain similarities between the lux and mel <dig> loci suggests that they may have related functions. however, it seems unlikely that this function is bioluminescence, since mycobacteria are not normally bioluminescent and we did not observe any bioluminescence associated with our mutant or complemented strains . our observation that the mel <dig> locus plays a role in resistance to ros helps to explain the presence of loci similar to bioluminescence genes in non-luminescent bacterial pathogens.

the inherent resistance of m. marinum to ros is impacted by a mutation in the mel <dig> locus. this observation suggests that mel <dig> has an important role in either directly scavenging oxygen radicals or repairing damage caused by them. since the mel <dig> mutant affects susceptibility to h2o <dig> and the organic peroxides cumene hydroperoxide and t-booh, which generate alkoxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals and h2o <dig>  <cit> , it is unclear whether mel <dig> is specific to a particular type of ros. the apparent absence of specificity could be the result of this pathway utilizing an unknown oxidizable substrate that is recycled, similar to luciferin in bioluminescent systems  <cit> , direct scavenging of h2o <dig>  which all three compounds produce, or repair of damaged dna, proteins or lipids  <cit> . interestingly, luciferase can produce light using h2o <dig> alone, in the absence of luciferin, suggesting that luciferase can scavenge h2o <dig>  superoxide and hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . overall, these data suggest that melf functions as a fmn-dependent non-heme catalase. the presence of the mel <dig> locus in pathogenic mycobacteria may at least partially explain why the catalase  gene can be mutated during acquisition of isoniazid resistance  <cit> , yet katg negative m. tuberculosis are responsible for numerous clinical infections in humans  <cit> . since oxidative stress increases susceptibility of mycobacteria to isoniazid  <cit> , it is possible that in some cases there is a relationship between isoniazid susceptibility and the mel <dig> locus. this possibility can be tested by comparing the effects of a double and single katg and mel <dig> mutants on virulence and isoniazid resistance.

the role of bioluminescence systems from other bacteria in resistance to rns has not been examined, but our observations with mel <dig> suggest that this possibility is worth investigating. since susceptibility to both snap and acidified nano <dig> are impacted by the mel <dig> mutation, this phenotype is not the result of greater susceptibility to the acidic ph used with nano <dig>  the fact that the mel <dig> mutant displays an obvious defect when exposed to a combination of both ros and rns would imply that this locus is important for growth in environments where both of these reactive species are present, such as during infection of mammals. we found that the m. marinum luxa homologue, melf, may play an important role in resistance to both rns and ros, since this gene alone can partially complement what may be a polar mutation. alternatively, this observation could be the result of low levels of expression of the remainder of genes within mel <dig>  as a result of the polar mutation. this polar mutation would allow only low levels of the putative mel <dig> protein complex to be formed and provide partial complementation once a functional melf gene is expressed. a better understanding of the biochemical roles of each of the mel <dig> genes and their importance in susceptibility to ros and rns will require analysis of each gene individually as well as in the presence or absence of each of the different mel <dig> components.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we confirmed that the mel <dig> locus plays a role in the susceptibility of m. marinum to ros and rns. although this locus displays similarity to bioluminescent systems in other bacterial species, further biochemical studies are necessary to demonstrate the functional significance of the conserved domains that are present. these observations suggest that mel <dig> represents a previously unrecognized pathway for resistance of bacterial pathogens to ros and rns and support the concept that bioluminescence systems may have evolved from oxidative stress defense mechanisms.
