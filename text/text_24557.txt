BACKGROUND
carotenoids, a complex class of c <dig> isoprenoid pigments synthesized by photosynthetic organisms, bacteria and fungi  <cit> , are essential components of the human diet. the most important function is as a dietary source of provitamin a  <cit> . vitamin a deficiency can result in xerophthalmia, increased infant morbidity and mortality, and depressed immunological responses  <cit> . additionally, carotenoids as antioxidants can reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other chronic diseases  <cit> . common wheat  is a major cereal crop, supplying significant amounts of dietary carbohydrate and protein for over 60 % of the world population. it is also an important source of carotenoids in human diets  <cit> . moreover, carotenoids in wheat grains determine flour color, an important quality trait for major wheat products such as noodles.

phytoene synthase  catalyzes a vital step in carotenoid biosynthesis, generally recognized as the most important regulatory enzyme in the pathway  <cit> . although there are up to three psy isozymes in grasses, only psy <dig> expression is associated with carotenoid accumulation in grains  <cit> . the wheat psy <dig> gene was cloned based on the sequence homology, and qtl analysis showed that psy <dig> co-segregated with yellow pigment content , which is significantly related to carotenoids   <cit> . to date, several studies have focused on homology-based cloning of psy <dig> and qtl analysis, whereas gene function and regulation remain to be determined.

common wheat has a large genome that consists of three closely related  genomes with 93–96 % sequence identity and a high proportion of repetitive sequences   <cit> . homoeologous gene duplication limits the use of forward genetics due to compensatory processes that mask the effects of single-gene knockout mutations  <cit> . therefore, the ability to investigate gene function and regulation in wheat ultimately depends on robust, flexible, high-throughput reverse genetics tools.

rna interference  is a sequence-specific gene suppression system that has been used in a variety of plant species as an efficient tool to decrease or knock-out gene expression. rnai has an enormous potential in functional genomics of common wheat, because all homoeologs  can be simultaneously silenced by a single rnai construct  <cit> . to date, rnai has been used to target a wide range of genes in wheat, including those encoding lipoxygenase, starch biosynthetic enzymes, and proteins involved in storage .

with next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, rna-sequencing  has emerged as a useful tool to profile genome-wide transcriptional patterns in different tissues and developmental stages, and can lead to the discovery novel genes in specific biological processes  <cit> . in this context, comparative analysis of transcriptome data between transgenic lines and wild type can reveal the transcriptional regulation network associated with genetic change.

targeting induced local lesions in genomes  is a powerful reverse genetics approach combining chemical mutagenesis with a high-throughput screen for mutations, and has been widely used in functional genomics  <cit> . compared to typical reverse genetics techniques such as rnai and insertional mutagenesis, the main advantage of tilling is the ability to accumulate a series of mutated alleles, including silent, missense, truncation or splice site changes, with a range of modified functions, from wild type to almost complete loss of function  <cit> . these mutations are excellent materials for understanding gene function, genetic regulation and compensatory processes  <cit> . moreover, alleles generated by tilling can be used in traditional breeding programs since the technology is non-transgenic and the mutations are stably inherited.

the main objectives of the present work were to investigate psy <dig> function and genetic regulation using three complementary reverse genetics approaches. psy <dig> was specifically silenced in wheat grain by rnai to confirm psy <dig> function. comparative analysis of transcriptome data between transgenic lines and non-transformed controls by rna-seq was used to reveal the transcriptional regulation network responding to psy <dig> down-regulation. in addition, two ems -mutagenised wheat populations were screened for mutations in psy <dig> by tilling to obtain a series of psy <dig> alleles with potential to increase our understanding of the gene function, genetic regulation and compensatory processes. this integrative approach provided new insights into the molecular basis and regulatory processes of carotenoid biosynthesis in wheat grain.

methods
wheat transformation and regeneration
the binary vector psaabx <dig> containing the endosperm-specific promoter of hmw-gs  bx <dig>  the nopaline synthase  terminator, and a selectable neomycin phosphotransferase ii  gene, was used to construct an rnai vector. the first exon of psy <dig>  was selected as the trigger fragment. briefly, the sense fragment of psy <dig> was amplified using the primer pair ps-f containing a bamhi site and ps-r with an asuii site, while the antisense fragment was amplified with primers pa-f containing a kpni site and pa-r including a nhei site . the fourth intron of psy <dig> as the spacer was amplified by primers in-f and in-r. all sequences and directions of the inserts were confirmed by sequencing. the final rnai construct was named prnaipsy <dig> .fig.  <dig> non-scale diagram of the rnai cassette in the transformation plasmid prnaipsy <dig>  the trigger fragment of psy <dig> was placed in forward  and reverse  orientations separated by the fourth intron of the wheat psy <dig> gene . restriction sites used in the rnai vector construction are indicated. bx <dig>  endosperm-specific promoter; nos, agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase  terminator




prnaipsy <dig> was transformed into wheat cultivar nb <dig> by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation  <cit> . briefly, immature seeds were collected at  <dig> dpa and sterilized with 70 % ethanol for 1 min, 20 % bleach for 15 min and rinsed three times with sterile water. isolated immature embryos were precultured on the induction medium for  <dig> d in dark at 25 °c. then, the embryos were inoculated with a drop of a. tumefaciens suspension and co-cultured for  <dig> d on the same medium. the immature embryos were cultured on selection medium at 25 °c in the dark for 3 weeks for callus induction. then, the calli were transferred onto regeneration medium at 25 °c in the light with a density of 45 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> and 16 h photoperiod for another 3 weeks for differentiation process. the culture media are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  all materials used for rnai were kept at crop research institute, shandong academy of agricultural sciences.

regenerated plants were screened using g <dig>  surviving plants were transferred to soil and grown to maturity under growth chamber conditions of 22/16 °c day/night temperatures, 50–70 % relative humidity, 16 h photoperiod, and light intensity of 300 μmol photons m− <dig> s− <dig>  transformed plants were verified by pcr using specific primer pairs designed for the fad <dig> intron, a part of the psaabx <dig> vector . positive transgenic plants were self-pollinated and harvested in the following generations. t <dig> transgenic lines and non-transformed controls were grown under field conditions in jinan, shandong province, during the 2013– <dig> cropping season. seeds were sown in 2 m rows with  <dig> plants per row, 30 cm between rows and  <dig> rows per transgenic line. transformed plants were verified by pcr and tagged at anthesis. grains for psy <dig> expression analysis were collected at 7-day intervals from  <dig> to 28 days post anthesis , immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °c. mature grains were harvested for ypc assays.

rna extraction and gene expression analysis
total rna was extracted from grains of t <dig> transgenic lines and non-transformed controls at different developmental stages using an rnaprep pure plant kit , and then treated with dnase i , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna purity and concentration were measured using a nanodrop- <dig> spectrophotometer . rna integrity was evaluated on agarose gels. reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total rna using a primescript™ rt reagent kit  following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.

quantitative real-time pcr  was performed on a roche lightcycler  <dig>  in 20 μl reaction mixtures containing 10 μl of lightcycler faststart dna master sybr green ,  <dig>  μm of each primer, 50 ng of cdna and  <dig>  μl of ddh2o. amplification conditions were an initial 95 °c for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s, 60 °c for 20 s and 72 °c for 20 s. fluorescence was acquired at 60 °c. designs for gene-specific primer amplifying all three psy <dig> genes were based on conserved regions among the a, b and d subgenomes. expression of a β-actin gene was used as an endogenous control to normalize expression levels of different samples. the primers are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  specificities of primers were confirmed by sequencing qrt-pcr products and melt curve analyses. gene expression levels were presented as multiples of actin levels calculated by the formula 2-Δct  to correct for differential cdna concentrations among samples  <cit> . for each line, three biological replicates, each with three technical replicates, were performed and the data were expressed as means ± standard error .

yellow pigment content  assay
grains from individual plants of t <dig> transgenic lines and non-transformed controls were ground into whole-grain flour by a cyclotec™  <dig> mill . the whole-grain flour  was used for ypc assay following zhai et al.  <cit> . three biological repeats were performed for each line, and each sample was assayed in duplicate; all differences between two repeats were less than 10 %.

transcriptome library construction and rna sequencing
to investigate the complex transcriptional regulation network underlying psy <dig> down-regulation, deep-sequencing analysis of transcriptomes of transgenic lines and non-transformed controls was performed by rna-seq. three transgenic lines  with the most significantly reduced ypc were selected . grains of transgenic lines and controls at  <dig> dpa were used for transcriptome analysis, because this developmental stage showed substantially decreased psy <dig> expression . total rna were extracted from pooled grains of six biological repeats per transgenic line or controls and sent to bgi  for rna-seq. transcriptome libraries were prepared and sequenced on the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform  following zhou et al.  <cit> .fig.  <dig> yellow pigment content in grains from t <dig> transgenic lines and non-transformed controls. data are presented as means ± standard error from three biological replicates. the double asterisks indicate significant differences between transgenic lines and controls at p =  <dig> . ck, non-transformed controls

screening and analysis of differentially expressed genes 
original image data were transformed into sequence data by base calling, and defined as raw reads. before data analysis, it was prerequisite to remove dirty raw reads including reads with adaptors, those with more than 10 % of unknown bases and low quality reads . clean reads were then aligned to the reference genome of t. aestivum . briefly, the clean reads were mapped to the genome reference by bwa software  <cit>  and to the gene reference with bowtie software  <cit> . reads mapping to unique sequences, designated as unigenes, were the most critical subset in the transcriptome libraries as they explicitly identify a transcript. unigene function was annotated by alignment of the unigenes with the ncbi  non-redundant  database using blastx at an e-value threshold of 10− <dig> 

gene expression level was normalized as the fpkm  by a rsem software package  <cit> . the fold-change in expression of each gene between the transgenic line and non-transformed control was evaluated by fpkm ratio. we used a false discovery rate  of < <dig>  and the absolute value of |log2ratio| ≥ <dig> as the threshold to judge the degs. to obtain robust and reliable effects of psy <dig> down-regulation on gene transcription, only degs consistent across all three transgenic lines were chosen for subsequent analysis. gene ontology  annotation was conducted using the blast2go program . the go categorizations were displayed as three hierarchies, namely biological process , cellular component  and molecular function  by wego software  <cit> . degs were also analyzed against the kegg database  to explore the potential metabolic pathways that might be involved in reduction of carotenoid synthesis in transgenic lines.

subcellular localization of psy <dig> in wheat
to investigate subcellular localization of psy <dig>  the cdna sequence of psy <dig> without the termination codon was isolated from common wheat cultivar jimai  <dig>  using primers, psy1-gfp-f  and psy1-gfp-r , and confirmed by sequencing. the cdna of psy <dig> was then c-terminally fused to the green fluorescent protein  gene in the pan <dig> vector to create psy1-gfp under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter. the psy1-gfp fusion and gfp were transiently transformed into wheat protoplasts following zhang et al.  <cit> . briefly, the stem and sheath of  <dig> wheat seedlings were cut into approximately  <dig>  mm strips, which were immediately transferred into  <dig>  m mannitol for 10 min in the dark. after discarding the mannitol, the strips were incubated in an enzyme solution for 4–5 h in the dark with gentle shaking . then, an equal volume of w <dig> solution was added, followed by vigorous shaking by hand for 10 s. protoplasts were released by filtering through 40 μm nylon meshes into round bottom tubes with 3– <dig> washes of the strips using w <dig> solution. the pellets were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 3 min, and were then resuspended in mmg solution. then, peg-mediated transfections were carried out  <cit> . fluorescence images were observed by a zeiss lsm <dig> confocal laser microscope .

ems mutagenesis
two ems-mutagenised common wheat populations were constructed following slade et al.  <cit>  with minor modifications. in brief, approximately  <dig>  seeds of common wheat cultivars jimai  <dig> and jimai  <dig>  were treated overnight with  <dig>  % ems solution and surviving plants were grown to maturity. seeds from the leading spikes of the m <dig> plants were harvested and one grain from each plant was sown to generate the m <dig> population . genomic dna was isolated from individual m <dig> plants for tilling analysis. twenty seeds from each m <dig> line containing a mutation in the psy <dig> gene and wild type were grown under field conditions for further analysis.

mutation screening by tilling
dna samples were extracted from individual m <dig> plants of ems-mutagenised populations derived from jimai  <dig> and jimai  <dig>  dna concentration was measured by a nanodrop- <dig> spectrophotometer  and standardized. equal amounts of dna from individual plant samples were pooled eightfold and organized into 96-well plates. the optimal target region for tilling screening, considered as one of the most promising for identifying mutations affecting protein function, was defined by the program coddle . in conjunction with the coddle results, homoeolog-specific primers were designed taking advantage of polymorphisms among the three homoeologs of psy <dig> in the hexaploid genome . primer specificities were validated using chinese spring nulli-tetrasomic lines and by sequencing.

a fast and cost-effective method, mismatch-specific endonuclease digestion of heteroduplexes followed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels stained with silver, was used for mutation detection, which has similar sensitivity to traditional li-cor screens  <cit> . once a positive individual was found, the amplified product was sequenced to determine the accuracy of the mutation.

parsesnp  was used to indicate the nature of each mutation. the parsesnp and sift  programs were used to predict the severity of each mutation. mutations are predicted to have a severe effect on protein function if pssm scores are > <dig> and sift scores are < <dig>   <cit> .

creation and characterization of f <dig> populations
to determine the impact of new psy <dig> alleles on protein function, homozygous m <dig> mutants carrying non-silent  mutations were backcrossed to corresponding wild type plants  to reduce background noise. f <dig> plants were self-pollinated and harvested separately. two hundred f <dig> seeds from each backcross and wild type were grown under field conditions in beijing during the 2013– <dig> cropping season, arranged in a randomized complete block design. seeds were sown in 2 m rows with  <dig> plants per row, 30 cm between rows and  <dig> rows per f <dig> population. three genotypes  in each f <dig> population were selected by sequencing. spikes of five biological replicates for each genotype were tagged at anthesis. immature grains were collected at 7-day intervals from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa for psy <dig> expression analysis. mature grains were harvested for ypc assays. all f <dig> populations were conserved at the crop germplasm resources conservation center, chinese academy of agricultural sciences.

the impacts of new psy <dig> alleles on ypc were assessed by comparing the differences between homozygous and heterozygous mutants with wild-type genotypes in each f <dig> population. ypc was measured by the method described above. all measurements were based on five biological repeats. wild-type genotypes in each f <dig> population were designated as the calibrator with its value set to  <dig>  the data are presented as means ± se.

qrt-pcr was performed on cdna from developing grains of each genotype in each f <dig> population at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa to investigate the effect of mutations on the expression pattern of the particular psy <dig> gene and its homoeologs. briefly, total rna was extracted from pooled grains of five biological repeats per genotype. two sets of primers were designed by comparing coding regions of the three psy <dig> homoeologs. the first set of primers amplifying all three homoeologs was used to examine gene-specific expression. the second set, the homoeolog-specific primers, was used to determine expression levels of each homoeolog . the specificity of these primers was tested as described above. the protocol for qrt-pcr was also the same. for each sample three technical replicates were performed. relative expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> . relative expression levels of psy <dig> and its homoeologs were normalized firstly to the transcript level of β-actin gene in the same sample and then calculated relative to the value of wild-type genotypes at  <dig> dpa  in each f <dig> population. expression analysis was performed only on f <dig> populations for the mutants with significant phenotypic changes.

functional domains and structural modeling of wheat psy1
functional domains of psy <dig> protein were predicted by the ncbi’s conserved domain database . to understand the effect of new psy <dig> alleles on protein structure, the three-dimensional structure of psy <dig> was generated by the swiss-model  and visualized using swiss-pdbviewer .

detection of alternative splicing variants
splice junction mutations are speculated to have severe effects on protein function because they can lead to aberrant rna splicing and subsequently altered or truncated protein translation  <cit> . although no splice junction mutation was identified in this study, mutation sites in m <dig> and m <dig> were adjacent to the splice site. the mutation site in m <dig> was localized at the 3′ end of exon ii and that in m <dig> was at the second nucleotide from the 3′ end of exon v. reverse transcription pcr was performed to investigate whether these mutations led to alternative splicing. briefly, total rna were extracted from homozygous mutant and wild type individuals, and reverse transcribed into cdna by the method described above. the cdna were amplified using the corresponding primers , and pcr products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and sequenced.

statistical analysis
data are presented as means ± se. student’s t test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in pairwise comparisons of transgenic lines and non-transformed controls, or between homozygous or heterozygous mutants and wild-type genotypes in each f <dig> population.

RESULTS
psy <dig> gene expression and ypc in grains of transgenic lines
the 460 bp trigger fragment from psy-a <dig> that was used for the rnai vector construction shared 90 % and 95 % sequence similarity with psy-b <dig> and psy-d <dig>  respectively. using the agrobacterium-mediated transformation method six positive, non-segregating transgenic lines, designated as 275-3a, 273-2a, 279-1a, 270-1a, 273-7a and 275-4a, were obtained. they showed no differences in morphology and development compared to non-transformed controls.

the effect of the transformed psy1-hairpin on psy <dig> expression was examined in six positive t <dig> transgenic lines during grain development. at  <dig> dpa, qrt-pcr analyses showed a significantly decreased transcript level of psy <dig> in the transgenic line 275-3a , significantly increased transcription levels in 273-2a and 273-7a , and slight changes in the other lines, compared to non-transformed controls. substantially decreased psy <dig> expression levels of 54–76 % were found in all transgenic lines at  <dig> dpa . at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa differences in expression levels between the transgenic lines and controls were very small , except for line 270-1a at  <dig> dpa and line 273-7a at  <dig> dpa . significantly decreased ypc ranging from  <dig> to 35 % occurred in all transgenic lines compared with non-transformed controls .

transcriptional profiling underlying psy <dig> down-regulation
totals of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unigenes were obtained for transgenic lines 273-2a, 275-3a, 279-1a and the control, respectively . comparison of the transcript abundances between transgenic lines and controls identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degs for 273-2a, 275-3a and 279-1a, respectively . in total,  <dig> degs were consistent across all three transgenic lines, perhaps representing the reliable effects of psy <dig> down-regulation on gene transcription .

categorization of go terms of the  <dig> degs is shown in fig.  <dig>  metabolic process and cellular process were the major categories annotated to the biological process ; cell part and cell were the major categories annotated to the cellular component ; and catalytic activity and binding were the major categories annotated to the molecular function . through pathway enrichment analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> degs were assigned to  <dig> metabolic pathways . the pathways significantly associated with psy <dig> down-regulation included carotenoid biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, various types of n-glycan biosynthesis, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism and citrate cycle, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms . all candidate genes in relevant pathways are listed in additional file 8: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> gene ontology classifications of differentially expressed genes  consistently present in all transgenic lines. because a gene can be assigned to more than one go term, the sum of genes in each category may exceed the number of degs . bp, biological process; cc, cell component; mf, molecular function

psy <dig> subcellular localization
psy1-gfp was constructed and transiently expressed in wheat protoplasts to investigate psy <dig> subcellular localization. protoplasts allow us to observe the localization of transiently expressed psy <dig> proteins, due to retain their tissue specificity after isolation and thereby reflect in vivo conditions. gfp alone was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm and nuclei , whereas the psy1-gfp fusion proteins co-localized exclusively with autofluorescence signals of chlorophyll, indicating that psy <dig> was localized in plastids .fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of psy <dig> in wheat protoplasts by confocal microscopy. gfp , chlorophyll autofluorescence , bright-field, and an overlay of green and red signals are shown. bar, 10 μm




identification of mutations in psy <dig> by tilling
eighty two new psy <dig> alleles were identified in the two ems-mutagenised populations, including three truncation,  <dig> missense and  <dig> silent mutations . as expected for alkylation of guanine by ems, the majority of mutations were g to a  or c to t  transitions, with the exception of six mutations as follows: a to c , a to g, a to t, t to c and t to g.table  <dig> summary of non-silent mutations in psy <dig> identified by tilling

characterization of new alleles of psy1
twenty-nine f <dig> populations were developed from homozygous m <dig> mutants carrying non-silent  mutations and corresponding wild type plants, and ypc assays were carried out to characterize the effects of the non-silent mutations on protein function. as shown in fig.  <dig> mutations in psy-a <dig>  namely m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  significantly reduced ypc by 9–29 % , whereas the mutation in psy-d <dig> of m <dig> significantly increased ypc by 34 %.fig.  <dig> relative yellow pigment content of different mutant genotypes in f <dig> populations. f <dig> populations were derived from homozygous non-silent  mutants crossed with corresponding controls . data are given as fold measures relative to wild-type genotypes in each f <dig> population . five biological replicates were performed for each comparison and the data are presented as means ± standard error. significant differences  between homozygotes and heterozygotes for the presence of the mutation and wild-type genotypes in each f <dig> population are represented by one or two asterisks: * p < <dig> , ** p < <dig> . hom, homozygous mutants; het, heterozygous mutants; wt, wild-type genotypes




the expression profiles of psy <dig> and its homoeologs in grains of each genotype in the six f <dig> populations were determined by qrt-pcr at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa . in three populations derived from truncation mutations in psy-a <dig> , psy-a <dig> expression levels in homozygous mutants were reduced to 11–48 % compared to wild-type sibs during grain development. compensatory responses from the b and d subgenomes were found to begin at  <dig> or  <dig> dpa. for two populations derived from missense mutations in psy-a <dig> , the psy-a <dig> expression levels in homozygous mutants were more than 33 % of that in wild-type plants, and the compensatory response began at  <dig> or  <dig> dpa. for the population derived from the missense mutation in psy-d <dig> of m <dig>  the expression profiles of psy <dig> and its homoeologs in homozygous mutants were significantly higher than that of wild-type genotypes during all grain development, except for  <dig> dpa.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of psy <dig> and its homoeologs in developing grains of three genotypes in each f <dig> population. a m <dig>  b m <dig>  c m <dig>  d m <dig>  e m <dig>  f m <dig>  for each genotype, five biological repeats were sampled and pooled for rna extraction and gene expression analysis. transcript levels are given as expression levels relative to the values of wild-type genotypes at  <dig> dpa  after normalization to β-actin level. data are presented as means ± standard error from three technical replicates. significant differences  between homozygous and heterozygous mutant individuals and wild-type genotypes in each f <dig> population are represented by one or two asterisks: * p < <dig> , ** p < <dig> . hom, homozygous mutants; het, heterozygous mutants; wt, wild-type genotypes




based on the ncbi’s cdd, four characteristic domains were identified in psy <dig> protein including aspartate rich regions , a substrate binding pocket, catalytic residues, and active site lid residues . for three missense mutations significantly influencing ypc and gene expression, the mutation sites of m <dig>  and m <dig>  were adjacent to the 177dxxxd <dig> domain, and the mutation in m <dig>  was close to the 302dxxxd <dig> domain. three-dimensional structure analysis showed that the mutation site of m <dig> was located at the entrance of the substrate binding pocket in the psy-d <dig> protein .fig.  <dig> functional domains of homoeologous psy <dig> protein sequences. amino acid sequences of psy <dig> were analyzed using the ncbi’s conserved domain database. numbers above the alignment indicate the amino acid positions along the psy-a <dig> protein. framed, aspartate rich regions ; open black circle, substrate binding pocket; filled circle, catalytic residues; line, active site lid residues; blue circle, missense mutations; red circle, mutations resulting in significant yellow pigment content change, including truncation and missense mutations

alternative splicing
the cdna of grains from homozygous mutants m <dig> and m <dig> and wild type were amplified and sequenced to investigate the impact of the mutations on pre-mrna splicing. pcr results for m <dig> revealed two products of different size, compared to only the smaller one in wild type individuals . sequences of the two transcripts showed that the larger product included a 25 bp fragment of intron ii, that resulted in a frame-shift mutation causing a premature termination codon at position  <dig> ; the smaller fragment was the constitutive transcript. the m <dig> mutant did not produce alternative splicing compared to wild type.fig.  <dig> alternative splicing in the m <dig> mutant. a reverse transcription pcr analysis showing alternative splicing in m <dig>  b alignment of cdna from homozygous m <dig> mutant and dna sequence of wild type. the sequence traces indicate that the g629a mutation in m <dig> caused an alternative splice junction site, located  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the normal splice junction. mu, mutagenised line; wt, wild type; m, molecular weight standard dl2000




discussion
psy1-specific silencing
rnai is a sequence-specific gene suppression system. previous studies indicated that nucleotide identity between the trigger fragment and target gene is crucial for successful gene silencing by rnai  <cit> . it has been suggested that effective gene silencing in higher plants requires 88–100 % nucleotide identity, and 81 % or less nucleotide identities are generally not sufficient for inducing strong and specific gene silencing  <cit> . in addition, the presence of a continuous stretch of similarity covering at least  <dig> identical nucleotides between the trigger fragment and target gene is required, although it may not always be sufficient for efficient gene silencing  <cit> . in this study, the first exon of psy-a <dig>  was selected as the trigger fragment; it shares 90 % and 95 % nucleotide identity with psy-b <dig> and psy-d <dig>  respectively. additionally, there were also six contiguous stretches of identical nucleotides longer than 21 nt. as expected, all three psy <dig> homoeologs were simultaneously silenced, which was proven by rna-seq .

in grasses, psy are encoded by three paralogous genes . the psy <dig>  psy <dig> and psy <dig> genes were located to the group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes, respectively  <cit> . to determine the gene specificity of our rnai construct, the sequence similarities among these three genes were analyzed. psy <dig> shared  <dig>  % nucleotide identity with psy <dig> within the 460 bp trigger fragment and had no contiguous stretches of identical nucleotides over 16 nt. the sequence of the target region in psy <dig> was not obtained, but the nucleotide identity in the known region was only  <dig>  % compared with psy <dig> . therefore, we inferred that the rnai construct used in the study specifically silenced psy <dig> expression rather than psy <dig> and psy <dig>  in contrast to psy <dig>  the rna-seq revealed that the expression levels of psy <dig> and psy <dig> were not significantly different between transgenic lines and controls .


psy <dig> expression was not significantly reduced in most transgenic lines at  <dig> dpa, , because the bx <dig> hardly expresses at this stage  <cit> . in contrast, psy <dig> expression level was substantially decreased in all transgenic lines at  <dig> dpa; this might be attributed to the highest expression level of bx <dig> and higher expression of psy <dig>  in the later developmental stages, the bx <dig> expression was still very high, whereas psy <dig> expression was not reduced distinctly in transgenic lines compared to controls, due to the low expression level of psy <dig> and the basic demand of carotenoids for normal growth of plants.

the effect of psy <dig> down-regulation
quantitative timing analysis of psy <dig> expression showed that the rnai effect was the greatest at  <dig> dpa, generating 54–76 % reductions compared to non-transformed controls. as expected, all transgenic lines showed significant ypc reductions, confirming the importance of psy <dig> for carotenoid accumulation in wheat grains.

in general, plants have the flexibility to cope with enhancements or reductions of gene products by coordinating the transcriptional regulation network. pleiotropic effects correlated with up- or down-regulation of psy genes were reported previously  <cit> , indicating a strong correlation between carotenoid biosynthesis and core metabolism, such as photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the citrate cycle . in this study, some candidate genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways and core metabolic processes were found to collectively participate in the adaptive process of psy <dig> down-regulation based on rna-seq analysis . in the carotenoid pathway, except for psy <dig> down-regulation, up-regulation of the zeta-carotene desaturase gene  might be attributed to feedback from reduction of downstream products. some genes involved in various types of n-glycan biosynthesis, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis and diterpenoid biosynthesis, were up-regulated in transgenic lines. these secondary metabolic pathways compete for fpp  or ggpp  with carotenoid biosynthesis, and therefore carotenoid biosynthesis reduction induces more precursors flow into other pathways. genes coding enolase , phosphoglycerate kinase , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  and triosephosphate isomerase  were up-regulated, which might favor the flow into gluconeogenesis since transgenic lines needed a lower flux through and out of the glycolytic pathway for carotenoid biosynthesis. enhancement of storage reserves synthesis, such as fructose and mannose metabolism and starch and sucrose metabolism, also proved this point. additionally, enhanced gluconeogenesis further induced photosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and citrate cycle. these previously unrecognized ypc-related-genes in core metabolism established a broader basis for the molecular regulating carotenoid biosynthesis in wheat grains.

dissection of psy <dig> by tilling
tilling is a flexible strategy for exploring gene function and regulation, producing large series of mutated alleles that may affect protein function and generate partial phenotypic changes or intermediate expression of target genes. in this study,  <dig> non-silent  mutations in psy <dig> genes in common wheat were identified, providing a resource not only for functional analysis, but also for understanding the importance of different amino acids and regions regulating the protein function, as well as to study compensatory responses.

the severity of each non-silent mutation was predicted by parsesnp and sift, and ypc in each f <dig> population was measured. however, severity prediction was not always consistent with changes in phenotype. for example, the mutation in m <dig> was predicted to have a severe effect on protein function, whereas it showed no significant phenotypic change. this might indicate that the conserved sequence had no direct role in controlling enzyme activity, since parsesnp and sift do not account for active or conserved domains, but make predictions based on amino acid conservation and properties after an alignment search in the protein sequence database  <cit> .

compared with missense mutations in psy-a <dig>  three truncation mutations showed stronger effects on psy-a <dig> expression by reducing psy-a <dig> transcript levels in homozygous mutants to 11–48 % of that in wild-type genotypes during whole grain development . these reductions might be due to a quality control mechanism preventing accumulation of non-functional or deleterious truncated proteins, known as nonsense mediated mrna decay  <cit> . in wheat, significantly reduced rna levels have also been reported for multiple genes containing premature termination codon mutations such as hmw glutenin subunit  <cit> , waxy gene  <cit> , and polyphenol oxidase gene  <cit> .

tilling is an efficient method to identify mutations in genes of interest, but the mutant effect is often masked by the presence of multiple copies of the same genes in polyploids, such as common wheat. in this study, the expression levels of three homoeologs were measured to study compensatory processes. unexpectedly, the expression of all three psy <dig> homoeologs was significantly reduced or increased together at  <dig> dpa, except for psy-b <dig> in m <dig> and m <dig> . in three truncation mutants, the compensatory responses from b and d homoelogs started at  <dig> dpa for m <dig> and m <dig> and at  <dig> dpa for m <dig>  for missense mutations in m <dig> and m <dig>  the compensatory response began at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, respectively. one possible reason for these phenomena was that the expression of all three psy <dig> homoeologs is coordinately regulated under normal conditions, but separately regulated under stress. furthermore, we inferred that  <dig> dpa was an important stage for psy <dig> expression regulation during wheat grain development because most compensatory responses started at this stage. more detailed investigations are needed to substantiate these hypotheses. compared with psy-b <dig>  the expression level of psy-a <dig> and psy-d <dig> showed more distinct changes, and it seems that they were more sensitive to expression regulation. rna-seq data also showed that the order of down-regulation level among three homoeologs was psy-d1 > psy-a1 > psy-b <dig> in transgenic lines .

the nucleotide change  in m <dig> resulted in substitution of arginine by lysine at position  <dig> . the three-dimensional structure of psy <dig> showed that this mutation was adjacent to the entrance of the substrate binding pocket in the psy-d <dig> protein, and was possibly easier for substrate binding due to a shorter carbon chain  resulting in increased carotenoid accumulation . this mutation might coordinately induce expression of all three psy <dig> homoeologs, although psy-b <dig> showed less changes . mutations in gene coding regions have potential to alter plant metabolism in ways other than changing the level of target gene products. for example, a mutated site may change the enzyme-substrate affinity, alter enzyme regulatory domains, or interfere with proper subunit or other protein-protein interactions. the aspartate rich region dxxxd is a conserved domain within isoprenoid synthases and forms an active site to bind phosphate groups of a substrate  <cit> . in this study, all missense mutants with severe effects on ypc were close to the dxxxd domain, indicating that these regions are very important for psy <dig> function. previous studies showed that sequence variations affecting the catalytic efficiency of the psy enzyme were as subtle as a single amino acid  <cit> . therefore, we infer that these mutations may affect the affinity of psy <dig> for phosphate groups of a substrate and further influence carotenoid accumulation.

alternative splicing
sequencing analysis of cdna indicated that the g629a mutation in m <dig> caused an alternative splice junction site, located  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the normal splice junction . this mechanism was previously reported in plants and explained by local scanning of the spliceosome to select the best intron splice site based on sequence context  <cit> . the mutation resulted in a frame shift and a premature termination codon at position  <dig>  we assume that the alternative splicing in m <dig> might decrease the content of functional psy <dig> protein and further reduce carotenoid biosynthesis. alternative splicing of psy <dig> regulating enzyme activity and carotenoid accumulation was also reported in wheat and hordeum chilense  <cit> .

molecular breeding
mutants identified by tilling are not involved in genetic modification and can be introduced into breeding programs. the use of mutagenesis in plant breeding is generally considered to have contributed to the release of more than  <dig>  crop cultivars with improved yield and quality traits  <cit> . therefore, mutants identified in this study will be useful as breeding germplasm for wheat quality improvement. for example, mutants m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> with significantly reduced ypc could be used in improvement of wheat genotypes for chinese style foods such as steamed bread and white chinese noodles where a bright whiteness is preferred. meanwhile, m <dig> with higher ypc could be useful for improving nutrition because carotenoids are important for human health. furthermore, these mutants come from elite wheat cultivars jimai  <dig> or jimai  <dig> and are potentially useful without further pre-breeding to remove undesirable agronomic traits.

CONCLUSIONS
the psy <dig> function and genetic regulation in common wheat were extensively analyzed using a complementary reverse genetics approach. the rnai-mediated down-regulation of psy <dig> resulted in remarkable reduction in ypc, confirming the important impact of psy <dig> on carotenoid accumulation in wheat grains. based on rna-seq and bioinformatics analysis, a series of candidate genes involved in both core metabolic processes and secondary metabolic pathways communicated and worked collaboratively to adapt to the psy <dig> down-regulation. the tilling identified a suite of mutations in psy <dig> and provided a more in-depth insight into the gene function, genetic regulation, structure-function relationship, as well as the compensatory response. the aspartate rich region dxxxd, a conserved domain among isoprenoid synthases, was identified as an important region influencing psy <dig> function in wheat, and conserved nucleotides adjacent to the domain influenced ypc by regulating gene expression, enzyme activity or alternative splicing. moreover, the compensatory response played a vital role in gene expression during gain development and  <dig> dpa was considered as a key regulation node. the findings achieved in the present study would be helpful to further disclose the molecular basis and genetic regulation of carotenoid synthesis in wheat grains and could eventually facilitate the genetic improvement of wheat quality in the future.
