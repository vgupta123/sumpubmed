BACKGROUND
snake venom is a complex mixture of biologically active proteins and peptides that exert very powerful and specific effects. this mixture is interesting from the angle of molecular evolution, as the genes encoding the venom ingredients seem to undergo some form of hypermutation resulting in accelerated evolution and a staggering diversity of isoforms  <cit> , sometimes functionally and structurally radically different. the basis for this phenomenon seems to be due to gene-duplication and diversification of existing venom genes. this results in a highly dynamic venom composition both at the interspecific and intraspecific level  <cit> . this allows the snake to deal with a wide array of different prey items. snake venom is also a valuable resource for proteins and peptides that may serve as lead compounds to treat certain human disorders  <cit> . examining the transcriptome of a venom gland will also reveal venom proteins that are low abundant, which is crucial to both expanding the resource of pharmaceutical compounds as well as to understand the evolution of snake venom proteins  <cit> . further, cataloguing of snake venom proteins through transcriptomic analysis may help to understand the pathophysiological symptoms induced after envenomation and correlates with the venom composition  <cit> .

for example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins  in viperid venom  <cit> . by elucidating the gene structures of these toxins we could infer their relationship with the elapid 3ftxs, which helped us to understand the evolution of this toxin protein family. hence, snake venom gland transcriptomes continue to be a valuable tool in improving our understanding of snake venom composition and evolution, management of snake bite, and the opportunity to identify and study the function of the low abundant proteins.

kraits  belong to the family elapidae. they are one of the better studied snakes of the world. they are widely distributed across south and southeast asia and are highly venomous  <cit> . many biologically important proteins, particularly α- bungarotoxins, κ- bungarotoxins and β- bungarotoxins, have been well characterized from the venom of bungarus species. the first two belong to the 3ftx family, whereas the last one is a covalent heterodimer of phospholipase a <dig>  and a serine protease inhibitor  -like polypeptide  <cit> . α- bungarotoxin is a highly specific toxin that binds to peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  and it played a key role in the isolation and characterization of mammalian nachrs  <cit> . similar to other long-chain neurotoxins, it also binds to neuronal α <dig> nachrs  <cit> . κ- bungarotoxins specifically bind to neuronal nachrs   <cit> . on the other hand, β- bungarotoxins - the major lethal factors bind to voltage-sensitive potassium channels in the presynaptic site  <cit> .

the b. flaviceps, commonly known as the red-headed krait, has phenotypically distinctive coloring of blue and black body, and the head, neck and tail are bright red in color. the venom of b. flaviceps is more potent than b. fasciatus but comparable in potency to b. candidus venom; the ld <dig> values of b. flaviceps, b. candidus and b. fasciatus venoms are  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  μg and  <dig>  μg per kg of experimental mouse respectively  <cit> . other than the isolation and characterization of β- bungarotoxin  <cit> , κ- flavitoxin  <cit>  and pla <dig>  <cit> , not much information is available on the venom of b. flaviceps. therefore, we have here examined the venom gland of b. flaviceps by using expressed sequence tags  to explore the venom composition in detail as well as to identify novel and low abundance toxins.

RESULTS
composition of cdna library
we randomly selected  <dig> clones from the cdna library and isolated the plasmids.  <dig> clones having inserts larger than  <dig> bp were numbered randomly and designated with bf . sequences were categorized based on the similarity shown in the analysis results and submitted to the database . accordingly,  <dig> % of the ests were putative toxin transcripts,  <dig> % were unknown transcripts and  <dig> % of the ests were cellular transcripts . using sequence similarities to known toxins as a guide, all the putative toxin transcripts were further classified into different toxin families. accordingly, the b. flaviceps ests contained transcripts encoding for six toxin families. most clones encoded for 3ftxs  , and kunitz-type spi . the other toxin families are less well presented; clones encoding phospholipase a <dig>  , and two clones each of natriuretic peptide , cysteine-rich secretory protein , and c-type lectin . 3ftx is the major transcript of this venom gland library constituting  <dig> % of the toxin transcripts. similar observation was made in micrurus corallines venom gland library which belongs to the elapid family where the 3ftx constitutes ~52% of the toxin transcripts  <cit> . this indicates that 3ftx is the major toxin of elapid snakes where as in viperid venoms proteases are the major venom components . by comparing the total number of sequences versus number of new toxin sequences identified we showed that the number of new toxin transcripts was reaching an asymptote. our results can thus be considered as a representative of the overall venom composition of b. flaviceps . although this study is not exhaustive, we have identified a number of low abundance transcripts . we believe when the library contains high percentage of clones  coding for toxin-like proteins, sequencing 600- <dig> clones may be sufficient to identify a number of low abundant clones.

three-finger toxin  family
three-finger toxins are a group of low-molecular weight , non-enzymatic polypeptides which have  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . they have 8- <dig> cysteine residues forming four or five disulphide bridges, of which four disulphide bridges are conserved  <cit> . members of this family possess similar protein structures: three β- stranded loops extending from a central core, which is made up of the four highly conserved disulphide bridges  <cit> , hence the name three-finger toxins. this 3ftxs family have been recruited in snake venom from a gene recruitment event within the slur/lynx protein family  <cit> , and their ancestral function is thought to be inhibition of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor   <cit> . however, despite retaining the common three-finger motif, members of this family have since evolved a myriad of different functions. these include effects on: platelet function  <cit> , different receptors associated with neurotransmission  <cit> ; ion channels  <cit> , viability of cardimyocytes  <cit>  and red bloods cells  <cit> , mitosis and apoptosis  <cit> ; and effects on the cell membrane  <cit> . the different 3ftx members also vary considerably in binding affinity for the different receptors  <cit>  and are important research ligands for studying receptors  <cit> .

based on sequence similarities,  <dig> full length transcripts of 3ftxs were divided into  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singletons. these ests were segregated into eight distinct groups of toxins based on blast results . the first group has two clusters, bf <dig> and bf <dig>  and a singleton ; they all encode identical mature protein but have a single amino acid differences in the signal peptide regions and mature protein. they share 61% identity and 76% similarity to both candiduxin  <dig> and buntoxin  . similarly, bf <dig>  encodes for a toxin that is also similar to candiduxin  <dig> from b. candidus  and buntoxin with 81% and 79% identity respectively . second cluster represented by clone bf <dig> show higher identity  and similarity  to the candiduxin <dig> and buntoxin than the above group of toxins. however the biological functions of candiduxin  <dig> and buntoxin are yet to be elucidated. the third group with two clusters, bf <dig> and bf <dig>  show 51% identity to 3ftx iii from walterinnesia aegyptia  <cit>  and 47% identity to erabutoxin a from laticauda semifasciata . in erabutoxin a lys <dig>  trp <dig>  asp <dig>  arg <dig> and lys <dig> are important in the binding to torpedo nachr  <cit> . interestingly, the toxin encoded by bf <dig> has 27th, 29th and 47th residues replaced with met, phe and asn respectively but the 31st and 33rd residues are conserved. lower structural similarity combined with replacement of critical residues in the functional site may confer distinct pharmacological properties or specificities to these 3ftxs. one of the clusters, bf <dig>  displays sequence similarity   to bucain from b. candidus venom  <cit> ;  <cit>  and a neurotoxin homolog ntl <dig>  <cit> . similar to bucain, this toxin may exhibit not-so-potent neurotoxicity.

the ests included  <dig> clones of non-conventional 3ftxs  . three clusters represented by bf <dig>  bf <dig> and bf <dig> with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clones respectively, which have few minor amino acid residue changes in the mature proteins. these transcripts encode proteins similar to candoxin with 80% identity . candoxin from b. candidus venom is known to bind reversibly to peripheral nachrs and irreversibly to α <dig> nachrs  <cit> . functionally, these b. flaviceps proteins may exhibit similar, if not identical, properties. second cluster bf <dig> , bf <dig>  and bf <dig>  shows 87% and 70% identity to two non-conventional toxins from b. candidus venom . the other two isoforms are much closer . similarly, bf <dig>  showed 64% identity to both bm <dig>  <cit>  and bulongin  from b. multicinctus and b. candidus venoms respectively . bm <dig> binds to muscarinic m <dig> receptor subtypes with much lower affinities compared to typical muscarinic toxins from dendroaspis venoms  <cit> . in bm  <dig>  trinitrophenylation of the lys residues  abolished its binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor . however, based on the lower structural similarity and the lack of the critical lys residues , we speculate that the protein coded by bf <dig> may have distinct biological properties compared to bm <dig> and bulongin.

interestingly, only one singleton, bf <dig>  shows 100% match  to κ-flavitoxin  from the venom of b. flaviceps flaviceps  <cit>  . the observed truncation at the 5'end is likely to be due to its degradation of mrna during total rna extraction. κ- flavitoxin is a competitive neuronal acetylcholine receptor  antagonist  <cit> . in general, κ- neurotoxins are highly specific antagonists of α3β <dig> and α4β <dig> receptors  <cit> . interestingly, we did not find a transcript encoding α- bungarotoxin.

due to the dominating role of α-, β- and κ- bungarotoxins in bungarus species, the functional roles of other toxins have not been systematically explored. of the eight major groups of 3ftxs in our b. flaviceps venom gland ests data, only κ- neurotoxins are fairly well characterized. therefore, it will be interesting to study these toxins and identify the molecular targets.

during our sequencing studies, we observed a number of clones with part of their sequences missing. in translated sequence of bf <dig> and bf <dig> , loop i and part of loop ii was found to be missing. when bf <dig> was compared to the gene of the black-and-white spitting cobra  encoding weak neurotoxin  <dig>   <cit> , we found that exon ii was missing in this clone . thus these clones were probably generated by an error in splicing. premature truncation was also observed in bf <dig> and bf <dig> . in bf <dig>  truncation is due to a dinucleotide deletion, whereas in bf <dig> the insertion of adenosine nucleotide has lead to a frame shift. it is not clear whether these aberrations are artefacts of cloning and sequencing or products of independent genes, this requires further investigation. in any case, these truncated transcripts constitute about 3% of 3ftxs and may not have any influence on the overall toxicity of the venom.

recently, by the analysis of gene structures of viperid 3ftxs, we showed that some of these toxins evolve through the phenomenon of segment switch  <cit> . the analysis of cdna sequences of b. flaviceps reveals that these toxins also appear to be evolving through accelerated segment switch in exons . this phenomenon, named as asset, may be an alternative mechanism of accelerated evolution of snake venom toxins  <cit> .

β- bungarotoxin
β-bungarotoxin is one of the major lethal components found in the venom of bungarus species. it targets the pre-synaptic terminal, where it causes the massive release of acetylcholine resulting in subsequent exhaustion of acetylcholine and inability to conduct an impulse and finally, paralysis. it is a heterodimeric covalent protein complex  <cit>   composed of chain a similar to pla <dig> and chain b similar to kunitz-type spi. it is a potent presynaptic neurotoxin  <cit> . we found three isoforms of chain a and four isoforms of chain b . chain a transcripts represented  <dig> % of all ests  and chain b transcripts  <dig> %  . this drastic difference in expression level is interesting, considering the fact that these two chains combine to an equimolar complex . this difference in expression levels requires further investigation. as the two chains belong to two different families, they will be discussed separately below.

kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor  family
kunitz-type spis are one of the major groups of snake venom proteins mainly reported from the venoms of elapidae and viperidae snakes and they inhibit either trypsin or chymotrypsin  <cit> . structurally they belong to the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor  family  <cit> . they have approximately  <dig> amino acid residues with six cysteine residues  <cit>  arranged in a conserved sequence motif of c-8x-c-15x-c-4x-yggc-12x-c-3x-c  <cit> .

as mentioned above, the b chain of β- bungarotoxins is structurally similar to kunitz-type spi proteins. we found four clusters that exhibit high similarity to the b chain of β- bungarotoxins. most common chain b isoform, bf <dig>  is 100% identical to ibv_bunfl, a chain b precursor isolated from b. flaviceps  <cit> . the other three isoforms , differ in amino acid residue from the major isoform in one or two positions .

the second group of kunitz-type spi clones are similar to the b chain of β- bungarotoxins but lack the extra cysteine at the c-terminal end . this extra cysteine residue is involved in interchain disulfide and is important for the complex formation of β-bungarotoxin . the principal isoform bf <dig> with  <dig> clones shows similarity to chain b  precursor of β- bungarotoxin from b. multicinctus  <cit> . similarly bf <dig> and bf <dig>  are also similar to chain b  of β-bungarotoxin. due to the absence of the extra cysteine, we believe that this polypeptide remains as monomer, similar to dendrotoxins  <cit>  in the venom. based on the high sequence identity and similarity to the chain b of β- bungarotoxins and dendrotoxins , it is tempting to speculate that they might block voltage sensitive potassium channels  <cit> . this needs to be further investigated.

we found two clusters, bf <dig> and bf <dig>  as the third group of kunitz-type spi clones. the major isoform is structurally similar to kunitz inhibitor iv from w. aegyptia . interestingly, the minor isoform  was found to be prematurely truncated. comparison of mrna sequence bf <dig> and a kunitz-type spi from the king cobra  , and to the sequence of pilp- <dig> from b. multicinctus  <cit> , reveals that  <dig> nucleotides from exon ii is lost in these clones . however the stop codon and 3'utr encoded by exon iii is conserved in this clone. this splicing error could occur due to the presence of gt  in exon ii. the truncated mature protein has  <dig> amino acid residues with the first pair of cysteine residues. it would be interesting to study its biological properties.

to understand the evolutionary relationships of kunitz-type spis and b chains among the bungarus species we constructed a phylogenetic tree using bpti as an out group . the b. flaviceps precursors  of b chains of β- bungarotoxins cluster separately from other two groups. the second group of transcripts  clusters together with kunitz-type spi  despite their similarities to chain b of β- bungarotoxins . thus most likely they are not the intermediates in the evolution of chain b. in the case of b. candidus and b. fasciatus, b chain cluster separately from the kunitz-type spis. in b. multicinctus b chains, b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> cluster together and are closer to pilp- <dig>  a spi, whereas b chains b <dig> and b <dig> are closer to spis, pilp <dig> and pilp <dig> 

phospholipase a <dig>  family
pla <dig> enzymes are esterolytic enzymes which hydrolyze glycerophospholipids at the sn- <dig> position of the glycerol backbone, resulting in the release of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. they are  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues long with an approximate molecular mass of 13- <dig> kda. this family of enzymes have 12- <dig> conserved cysteine residues which form six or seven disulphide bridges  <cit> . structurally, they share a similar protein folding pattern of a α-helical core, a backbone loop and a β- wing  <cit> . functionally, they have a broad array of pharmacological effects which encompass neurotoxic, myotoxic, cardiotoxic, haemolytic, convulsive, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, oedema-inducing and tissue-damaging effects .

within the ests,  <dig> % of the transcripts belong to pla <dig> family . clones encoding pla <dig> were grouped into two clusters  and two singletons . prediction of signal peptide using signalp program indicates that these sequences have the eight amino acid propeptide sequences   <cit> . this propeptide sequence in bf <dig> is represented by "snvppqpl" whereas in bf <dig> and bf <dig> it is "aivppqpl" and there are two substitutions . although similar propeptides are found in other elapid pla <dig> enzymes, most mature proteins do not have them. only a small number  retain them. the pla <dig> isoforms are highly similar to each other except for few amino acid substitutions in the mature protein . clone bf <dig> has a deletion of  <dig> amino acid residues  as compared to the other pla <dig> isoforms. comparison of the bf <dig> sequence with the sea snake  pla <dig> sequence reveals that there is a deletion of  <dig> bp from exon ii . consequence of this deletion in exon ii in its activity is not known and needs further investigation. in one of the clones  the 5' end of the transcript was missing, this might be due to degradation of the mrna during preparation. when compared to b. flaviceps pla <dig> i  and pla <dig> ii  sequence  <cit> , bf <dig>  bf <dig> and bf <dig> show 93% identity .

as mentioned above, the chain a of β- bungarotoxins is structurally similar to pla <dig> enzymes. we found three clusters that exhibit high identity to chain a of β- bungarotoxins . bf <dig>  which has few amino acid residue changes both in the mature protein as well as in the signal peptide as compared to bf <dig>  and bf <dig> . but bf <dig> and bf <dig> have two residue differences; one amino acid substitution in the signal peptide and two others in the mature protein. cluster bf <dig> is 100% identical to chain a <dig> of β-bungarotoxin from b. flaviceps reported earlier whereas bf <dig> and bf <dig> show 97% identity to chain a <dig> in the mature protein  <cit> . multiple isoforms of chain a of β- bungarotoxin has been reported from bungarus species. five isoforms  have been reported from a single species of b. multicinctus snake  <cit> , but we have observed only three isoforms in b. flaviceps transcriptome.

natriuretic peptide family
natriuretic peptides  are endogenous hormones initially found in mammals. three mammalian nps have been identified and characterized so far, which includes atrial np , b-type np  and c-type np   <cit> . in nps a 17-residue ring structure, formed by an intra-molecular disulphide bond, is a highly conserved feature. functionally, nps are involved in various physiological processes such as regulation of water and electrolyte balance, cardiovascular system and cell growth  <cit> . physiologically, in mammals nps exhibit potent hypotensive and vasorelaxant properties and contributing to sodium and water retention  <cit> . the first np of snake venom was isolated from dendroaspis angusticeps venom and is known as dendroaspis natriuretic peptide   <cit> . it lowers the blood pressure through vasodilation  <cit> . interestingly two clones  encoding natriuretic peptides were identified in b. flaviceps library; one of them was partial while the other  was a full length transcript . this is the first full length mrna sequence of an elapid np precursor. when compared to cnp precursors of crotalid snakes, b. flaviceps np precursor lacks the bpp domain and part of the linker sequence  similar to colubrid np precursor reported from the duvernoy's  gland transcriptome of philodryas olfersii  <cit> . however, p. olfersii encodes for cnp type molecule, whereas b. flaviceps np belongs to the anp/bnp family due to the c-terminal extension . this is the first report of nps in any asian elapid. we constructed a phylogenetic tree to understand the evolutionary relationships of anp/bnp found in different snakes. b. flavipceps anp/bnp was found to be closely related to african mamba  and coral snake  nps, but distantly related to the australian elapid counterparts . however the presence of these transcripts in the protein level need to confirmed through proteomic approaches.

other families
crisps , and c-type lectins  transcripts were found, in a level of  <dig> % of the total ests . the crisps transcripts showed high similarity to latisemin reported from laticauda semifasciata, oharin precursor from ophiophagus hannah, pseudechetoxin-like protein precursor from oxyuranus scutellatus and to kaouthin- <dig> precursor from naja kaouthia  <cit> . latisemin, ophanin and tigrin block potassium-stimulated smooth muscle contraction  <cit> . in crisps n-terminal pathogenesis-related protein- <dig>  domain and the c-terminal cysteine-rich domain are conserved. pr- <dig> is known to be important for recognition of the target molecule and this domain. c-type lectins are non-enzymatic proteins which interact with carbohydrate moieties in the presence of ca2+ ions and usually possess the highly conserved carbohydrate recognition domain   <cit> . one full length and other partial c-type lectins were obtained in this library. the full length transcripts have seven cysteine residues hence they are likely to exist as covalent homodimers in the venom  <cit> . analysis of the translated sequence reveals a ca2+ binding site  <cit> , suggesting that it is a ca2+-dependent c-type lectin.

cellular transcripts
the cellular transcripts  constitute about  <dig> % of the total transcripts. some of the important house-keeping ests include: ribosomal protein , protein sec <dig> beta subunit  involved in protein transport, eukaryotic translation initiation factor  and eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> beta  <dig> , which are involved in protein transcription and translation. the proteins encoded by these transcripts are involved in protein synthesis and secretion. other house-keeping transcripts involved in cellular functions were: nadh dehydrogenase ; ubiquitin c ; adp-ribosylation factor-like ; cytoplasmic actin type 5; ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase; sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter; succinate-coa ligase; type  <dig> glutamine amidotransferase; l-lactate dehydrogenase; and a dna bindng protein  .

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of  <dig> ests of the venom gland of the red-headed krait  shows that 3ftxs and b chains of β-bungarotoxins are the main components of the venom. most of the 3ftxs transcripts described here are structurally different from the previously characterized 3ftxs and hence they are likely to show distinct biological activities. we found a group of kunitz-type spis highly similar to b chain of the β-bungarotoxin, but without the extra cysteine involved in interchain disulfide. identification of anp/bnp underscores the importance of transcriptome analysis in identifying low abundant proteins. thus our study provides a platform to initiate the characterization of several novel proteins found in b. flaviceps venom gland.
