BACKGROUND
macroautophagy  is a complex process involving degradation of cellular constituents to maintain organelle and protein homeostasis in response to various stresses, including genomic, oxidative, hypoxic, proteotoxic and metabolic stresses as well as starvation  <cit> . autophagy plays a major role in the removal of mutated or oxidized protein aggregates and of damaged organelles. it is also involved in restoring nutritional and metabolic imbalances during starvation. deficiency in the clearing and restoring function of autophagy leads to cell death, which ultimately contributes to growth retardation and various degenerative diseases, including neurodegenerative, muscular and cardiovascular diseases .

autophagy is an evolutionary conserved mechanism ubiquitously present in all eukaryotic cells. it is driven and regulated by several proteins designated as autophagy-related  proteins . at least  <dig> atg genes have so far been identified in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, the species initially employed for genetic screening of autophagy  <cit> . many atg orthologs have subsequently been identified in higher eukaryotes, including nematodes   <cit> , arthropods   <cit> , mammals   <cit> , as well as in plants  <cit> . furthermore, these atg genes seem to be highly conserved among different metazoan phyla. amongst these, phylum arthropoda has the largest number of species and their members are widespread throughout both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. while autophagy in insects has been studied intensively , the autophagic machinery in crustaceans is still unexplored. however, a few studies have shown the presence of autophagosome within the cells of the midgut in crustacean species by using electron microscopy and it has been suggested that autophagy might play an important role for midgut cell survival .

many species of crustaceans, especially decapods , are a commercially important food source. during captivity in farming, these animals can be subjected to many stresses that affect feeding, growth, reproduction, and diseases. hence, management of stress, disease, and reproductive manipulation are crucial in farming. since these processes are related to autophagy , an understanding of the autophagic process in crustaceans is important for improvement of crustacean aquaculture. to date, the genome of the water flea, daphnia pulex, had been generated  <cit> . further, the transcriptomes of several crustaceans, including the mud crab   <cit>  and white shrimp   <cit> , have been provided in the online databases. recently, we have generated transcriptomes from the eyestalk, central nervous system  and ovaries of m. rosenbergii, leading to the identification of several genes encoding neuropeptides  <cit>  and steroidogenesis-related proteins  <cit> .

in this study, we identified atg genes in the above-mentioned m. rosenbergii transcriptomes and then examined the presence of key atg proteins in the tissues using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. furthermore, structural comparisons between human and m. rosenbergii marker proteins for autophagic process, including beclin  <dig> , vacuolar protein sorting   <dig>  microtubule-associated proteins 1a/1b light chain  <dig> , p62/sequestosome  <dig>  and lysosomal-associated membrane protein  <dig> , were performed to show that crustacean atg marker proteins have a similar structure, and possibly functional activity, to those of human. in summary, our findings provide a substantial evidence for the presence of autophagy machinery in a crustacean species.

RESULTS
gene mining of autophagy-related proteins in m. rosenbergii transcriptomes
an in silico search of atg proteins in m. rosenbergii transcriptomes  revealed  <dig> transcripts predicted to encode atg proteins . atg proteins are categorized based on their functions related to the progression of autophagic process as determined in yeast and mammals  <cit> . the first category includes the proteins involved in formation of the autophagy interactome that initiates the process of autophagy; the second category consists of proteins that are responsible for atg9-wipi <dig> complex formation, which triggers membrane nucleation and phagophore formation; the third category includes proteins that are involved in atg <dig> conjugation, which mediates phagophore elongation; the fourth category comprises of proteins involved in atg8/lc <dig> conjugation, which controls cargo sequestration and autophagosome formation; and the last category includes the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate -related proteins with other proteins associated with autophagic activities. of the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> transcripts appear to be full-length as determined by the presence of an initiation methionine and a stop codon. the m. rosenbergii atg predicted proteins together with best blast hit  is provided in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> atg transcripts present in m. rosenbergii transcriptomes in comparison with atg genes of mammals and yeast

sequence analyses of atg marker proteins in m. rosenbergii
further characterization, sequence alignment and structural comparisons of selected m. rosenbergii  atg proteins that are considered to be important markers for monitoring the autophagic process , and for autophagosome-lysosome fusion   <cit> , were analyzed. the mroatg <dig> consists of  <dig> amino acid residues in which the apg <dig> domain  was annotated . based on sequence alignment, the m. rosenbergii atg <dig> protein shares 61–91 % similarity with atg <dig> proteins of other crustacean species, while crustacean atg <dig> proteins display 54–62 % similarity to the human ortholog, homo sapiens  becn <dig>  . conserved amino acids were observed throughout the entire length of the protein. structural superimposition of hsabecn <dig> and mroatg <dig> revealed a similar conformation, including within the bcl- <dig> homology  <dig>  domain that corresponds to amino acid positions 105– <dig> of hsabecn <dig> .fig.  <dig> identification of an m. rosenbergii atg <dig>  a a schematic annotation of m. rosenbergii atg <dig>  and the alignment of crustacean atg <dig> proteins with atg6/becn <dig> of other species from different phyla. black shading indicates conserved amino acids while grey shading indicates similar amino acids. green bar indicates the region of bcl- <dig> homology  <dig>  domain of hsabecn <dig>  mro, macrobrachium rosenbergii; ple, pontastacus leptodactylus; cfi, calanus finmarchicus; dpu, daphnia pulex; dme, drosophila melanogaster; cgi, crassostrea gigas; spu, strongylocentrotus purpuratus; cel, caenorhabditis elegans; dre, danio rerio; xtr, xenopus tropicalis; mmu, mus musculus; hsa, homo sapiens. b predicted tertiary structures of hsabecn <dig>  and mroatg <dig>  and superimposition of hsabecn <dig> and mroatg <dig> . the bh <dig> domain is labeled on hsabecn <dig>  corresponding to amino acid positions 105–129

spatial expression of autophagy markers
we examined the presence of corresponding atg proteins in the female prawn by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. since there were no commercial antibodies available for m. rosenbergii atg proteins, we used antibodies raised against the human atg proteins, including atg6/becn <dig>  atg8/lc <dig>  p62/sqstm <dig> and lamp- <dig>  western blotting indicated the presence of atg6/becn <dig>  atg8/lc <dig> and p62/sqstm <dig> in various tissues, including the hepatopancreas, ovary, muscle, brain, eyestalk, and thoracic ganglia . based on band intensity, atg6/becn <dig> and p62/sqstm <dig> were abundant in the nervous tissues  and less abundant in other tissues such as the hepatopancreas, ovary, and muscle . the atg8/lc <dig> protein was detected prominently in the hepatopancreas, ovary, muscle, and thoracic ganglia, while its expression with less intensity was detected in the eyestalk .fig.  <dig> validation of the autophagy marker proteins in female m. rosenbergii tissues. western blotting shows the expression of atg6/becn <dig>  atg8/lc <dig>  and p62/sqstm <dig> in various tissues, including the hepatopancreas , ovary , muscle , brain , eyestalk , and thoracic ganglia . the expression of these marker proteins in human squamous carcinoma cells  is used as a positive control. the amount of total protein loaded per lane was 30 μg

discussion
autophagy refers to a lysosome-driven process for the degradation of cellular components that are redundant, aged, or damaged  <cit> . the control and execution of autophagy have been well characterized in the yeast s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and the worm c. elegans  <cit> , and are being investigated in human, mouse, the fruit fly , and plants. here we present the first study showing that the key genes and proteins involved in the regulation and execution of autophagy are present in crustaceans.

all atg proteins investigated could be identified from m. rosenbergii transcriptomes , confirming their widespread conservation amongst animal phyla. it is likely that the autophagic process in crustaceans follows the same pathway as in other animals, engaging a similar set of proteins from the initial triggering step  until the formation of active autophagic vesicles . the same hit transcripts were observed for gabarap and gabarapl <dig>  and ulk- <dig> and − <dig> transcripts. in the case of gabarap and gabarapl <dig>  it has been shown that there are at least three human gabarapls  genes which are homologues of the gabarap gene  <cit> . therefore, gabarap and gabaapl <dig> share a high sequence similarity and both, as well as other gabarapls, are categorized within the gabarap family  <cit> . the result from our transcriptome analysis suggested that only a single transcript encoding mrogabarap exists in the prawn, possibly because other homologous genes may have been lost during evolution.

atg <dig>  was initially isolated as an interactor of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  and thereafter named beclin  <dig>  <cit> . atg6/becn <dig> was next shown to be an essential activator of vps <dig> for the initiation of the autophagic process  <cit> . high conservation of protein amino acid sequence, especially at the c-terminal region, could be observed in this protein among vertebrates and invertebrates, indicating that those conserved motifs are significant for the activity of this protein. in particular, amino acid conservation within the bh <dig> domain region and structural superimposition of human becn <dig> and m. rosenbergii atg <dig> indicates that m. rosenbergii and other crustacean atg <dig> may interact with bcl- <dig>  and thereby play a regulatory role in apoptosis. upon interaction with becn <dig>  the pi3k class iii protein  catalyzes the formation of pi3p, which is essential for the recruitment of autophagosomal membranes  <cit> . vps <dig> protein is the most evolutionarily conserved protein within the pi <dig> kinase family  <cit> . we did consistently find that crustacean vps <dig> showed high conservation in their amino acid sequences with those of other invertebrates and vertebrates, especially at the domains described as critical for function. in fact, the vps <dig> protein contains three major domains, namely the c <dig>  pi3ka, and pi3kc domains  <cit> , which were present in the deduced mrovps <dig>  vps34/pi3kc <dig> is known to interact with other autophagic proteins such as atg <dig> and uv radiation resistance-associated gene   <cit> . since atg <dig> and uvrag proteins were found in m. rosenbergii transcriptomes  and the predicted structural conformation of m. rosenbergii vps <dig> is similar to human vps <dig> , we suggest that mrovps <dig> may exhibit a similar catalytic activity and bind to atg <dig> and uvrag.

atg8/map1lc3b is a protein that is inserted into the nascent autophagosomal membranes upon post-translational lipidation of the microtubule-associated precursor  <cit> . both length and amino acid composition were found to be similar among representative atg8/map1lc <dig> sequences from different animal species . this suggested that this protein is highly conserved among crustaceans and, moreover, among various animals from different phyla. consistent with this, the predicted structural conformation of m. rosenbergii atg <dig> exhibits a similar secondary structure to that of human map1lc3b, including within the regions that are known to be important for binding with atg <dig> and tubulin proteins . besides, atg8/map1lc3b normally interacts with other crucial autophagic receptors, for instance, atg <dig>  p <dig>  and atg <dig>  by using two specific hydrophobic pockets, called w- and l-sites . we have shown that the amino acid residues known to be important for map1lc3b interaction with other proteins are preserved in crustacean atg <dig>  suggesting that they are critical for atg8/map1lc3b functioning not only in vertebrates but also in crustaceans.

p62/sqstm <dig> is a ubiquitin-binding protein that bridges the autophagy substrate to lc <dig> through its lir domain  <cit> . three distinct domains significant for p <dig> activity include a pb <dig> domain located at the n-terminus that is responsible for p <dig> self-assembly  <cit> ; a uba domain located at the c-terminus that is important for p62-ubiquitin interacting  <cit> ; and a lir domain that provides an interaction site for binding with atg8/map1lc3b  <cit> . we found that p <dig> in crustaceans are not well conserved with other vertebrate p <dig>  both in their length and amino acid composition. a large amino acid insertion could be observed within the middle region of the crustacean p <dig> when compared to vertebrate p <dig> sequences. in regard to the lir motif, this region is highly conserved among vertebrate species but less conservation could be observed in invertebrate p <dig> proteins . however, we speculate that the important amino acids ‘wxxl’  within lir, which binds directly to map1lc3b in mammals  <cit> , are still preserved in invertebrate p <dig>  including m. rosenbergii, with an exception for the leucine residue which is substituted by other aliphatic amino acids such as valine or isoleucine. therefore, it is possible that invertebrate p <dig> may still have binding activity to map1lc3b similar to vertebrate p <dig> 

lamp- <dig> is an integral membrane protein of the endosomes and lysosomes, which is involved in the fusion of these organelles with autophagosomal vacuoles  <cit> . despite low similarity in amino acid composition, we found that the mrolamp- <dig> preserves basic characteristics of lamp- <dig>  <cit> , including a conserved luminal lamp domain . while other vertebrate lamp- <dig> contains eight cysteine residues within the luminal region, hence forming four disulfide bonds  <cit> , mrolamp- <dig> luminal domain contains only four cysteine residues potentially forming two disulfide bonds, and therefore likely not showing the looped-luminal domain with free-moving hinge as present in vertebrate lamp- <dig>  <cit> . considering a cytoplasmic tail of lamp- <dig>  this region contains the tyrosine-based motif  important for targeting lamp- <dig> to lysosomes . we found that all predicted crustacean lamp- <dig> display that significant motif, though their last residues were substituted by valine. although the intracellular targeting of lamp- <dig> was conserved among crustaceans and other animals, a variable amino acid sequence within the n-terminal part and distinct lamp domain characteristics suggests a different functional activity of crustacean lamp- <dig> from those of vertebrates.

based on sequence alignment, we found that the sequences of m. rosenbergii and human proteins at the regions used for producing anti-becn <dig>  anti-lc <dig>  anti-p <dig> and anti-lamp- <dig> antibodies shared  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % identity, respectively, suggesting that antibodies against the human autophagy proteins could be used to detect autophagic proteins in m. rosenbergii. we therefore employed immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry techniques to validate the expression and subcellular localization of atg marker proteins in m. rosenbergii tissues.

autophagy has been shown to be present in the epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas and/or intestine in different crustacean species, including astacus astacus, eubranchipus grubii and neocaridina heteropoda, in which autophagic activity was suggested to be essential for digestive cell survival  and a proper function of the digestive organs  <cit> . in our study, we found expression of atg6/becn <dig>  atg8/lc <dig>  p62/sqstm <dig> proteins to be widespread in various tissues of m. rosenbergii that were investigated . regarding atg8/lc <dig> expression, there were three immunoreactive bands detected in prawn tissues. the largest  and smallest  bands may be considered as the lc3-i and-ii forms, as compared with the lc <dig> expression in the human cell sample . the middle band, which is present at an apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  kda in some tissue samples, probably represents the intermediate lc3-i that precedes the lapidated form of 16 kda lc3-ii  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that the autophagic process is general to various prawn tissues, although the specific function of this process within different tissues still requires further investigation. in the ovary, we could observe that the levels of atg6/becn <dig>  atg8/lc <dig>  p62/sqstm <dig> and lamp- <dig> expression within the cytoplasm increased in correlation with oocyte maturation, while no immunoreactivity was found in the follicular cells. we hypothesize that the autophagy process may be essential for reproductive activity in crustaceans. however, whether autophagy is a part of cellular controls that regulate oocyte differentiation requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present data supports the high evolutionary conservation of autophagic components in the crustacean lineage, as implicated by the existence of several key autophagy-related genes and proteins, and a high degree of sequence conservation of crucial autophagy marker proteins among crustaceans and other representative species from different phyla. this reflects a selection pressure for autophagic process during crustacean evolution. in addition, we have demonstrated that antibodies raised against human autophagy marker proteins can be used for monitoring the autophagic process in a crustacean model. learning how autophagy is regulated in the giant freshwater prawn could open up new avenues for novel management in limiting infections, organ stress, as well as nutritional and metabolic imbalances due to feeding and starvation, which can ultimately impact on crustacean aquaculture.
