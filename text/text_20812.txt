BACKGROUND
polyation activity was originally identified in the 1960s  <cit> ; it is the rapid and reversible posttranslational covalent attachment of adp-ribose subunits onto glutamate, aspartate, and lysine residues of target proteins. the adp-ribose polymer is formed by sequential attachment of adp-ribosyl moieties from nad+; the polymers can reach a length of over  <dig> units and can have multiple branching points. overall, the adp-ribose polymer is highly negatively charged and has large physiological consequences on functional and biochemical properties of the proteins modified.

polyation is done by enzymes called polypolymerases . the so-called parp signature, a catalytic ÃŸ-alpha-loop-b-alpha nad+ fold  <cit> , characterizes these enzymes. parps are found in diverse groups of eukaryotes  <cit> , but are best studied in animals. parps have been shown to be involved in dna damage repair, cell death pathways, transcription and chromatin modification/remodelling . parps have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases  and are important targets for anti-cancer therapies  <cit> . a polymorphism in human parp <dig>  which causes decreased enzymatic activity, has been reported to be associated with an increased cancer risk and a decreased risk of asthma  <cit> , further underlining the importance of this class of enzymes and their complex roles in disease.

the first parp purified and cloned, parp <dig> from human, remains the best studied. parp <dig> was long thought to be the only enzyme with polyation activity until two parp isoforms were identified in plants  <cit>  and, simultaneously, tankyrase was identified as a parp localized at the telomere in humans  <cit> . subsequently, studies on parp <dig> knock out mice demonstrated that the mutant mice still possessed polyation capacity and developed normally  <cit> , suggesting other enzymes existed. since these studies, a number of genes containing the parp signature have been identified, although a minority of them have been functionally characterized.

the parp-like family has been best characterized in humans, where there are seventeen family members that share the parp catalytic domain, but vary widely in other parts of the proteins  <cit> . it is postulated that different parps subfamilies participate in diverse events mediated by their variable domain structures. however, only some of the family members have been shown to have parp activity, mostly in humans , parp <dig>  <cit> , tankyrase <dig>  <cit> , tankyrase <dig>  <cit> , and vparp  <cit> ). most of these enzymes contain an evolutionarily conserved catalytic glutamate residue in an "hye" catalytic triad. this residue was shown to be essential for poly chain elongation in human parp <dig>  <cit> . it is clear that some proteins with parp signatures missing the catalytic glutamate residue or other residues known to be important for chain elongation do not act in polyation. for example, human parp <dig> has transferase activity rather than polymerase activity, adding one adp-ribose subunit to target proteins  <cit> . it is thought that other parp-like proteins may actually function in monoation  <cit>  or even have non-enzymatic functions; human parp <dig> appears to not have enzymatic activity  <cit> . even enzymes that retain the catalytically important residues that have been identified may not act as parps. for example, conflicting reports about the catalytic activity of human parp <dig> exist; it has been reported act in polyation  <cit>  and monoation  <cit> .

our knowledge of the parp gene family is principally based on animals, in particular mammals. this taxon is a member of the opisthokonts, one of the six eukaryotic "supergroups"  <cit>  and therefore represents only a portion of the evolutionary history and diversity of known eukaryotes. for the other five eukaryotic supergroups, studies on parps have been limited or non-existent. a previous study on parps indentified new members in more basal animals, amoebas, fungi and plants  <cit> . however, no representatives from excavates or chromalveolates were included in the analysis and only one member of plantae . here we use comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis to investigate the distribution of parp genes across almost the entire breadth of eukaryotes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this protein family and to gain insights into its functional diversification. our results indicate that the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes encoded at least two parp proteins, one similar to human parp <dig> and functioning in dna repair and damage response, the other likely acting in monoation; the cellular role of the last group is not known.

RESULTS
identification of parp genes from eukaryotic genomes
we used the information obtained from the pfam database  <cit>  and uniprot  <cit>  along with blast searches  <cit>  of sequenced eukaryotic genomes at the doe joint genome institute , the broad institute, the j. craig venter institute, toxodb  <cit> , ncbi, dictybase  <cit>  and the arabidopsis information resource   <cit>  to compile the sequences of over  <dig> parp proteins. after preliminary alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we reduced the number of species representing animals; specifically we choose representative species of vertebrates since the genes from this group are shared by all and kept drosophila melanogaster or anopheles gambiae to represent insects, since all of our sequences were from diptera. this left us with  <dig> sequences from  <dig> eukaryotic species . in addition, another  <dig> sequences contained regions with high similarity to the parp catalytic domain ; however, these sequences were incomplete and not included in the alignment. nonetheless, these sequences likely represent bona fide members of the parp catalytic domain. the parp catalytic domain was extracted from the proteins sequences and aligned using muscle  <cit> . this alignment can be found in additional file  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis of the parp family suggests that the ancestral eukaryote had at least two parp enzymes
we first analyzed all the parp-like genes we identified in the eukaryotic lineage. we used the multiple sequence alignment of the parp catalytic domain generated above  to generate a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the parp family . we defined six clades of parps based on our maximum-likelihood tree, an examination of domains found outside of the parp catalytic domain used to generate that tree and the evolutionary relationships of organisms within clades . clades were defined as having a bootstrap value of at least . <dig>  one or more shared domains outside of the parp catalytic domain, and having subbranches consisting of proteins from closely related species. within each major clade one or more subclades were defined by similar reasoning; however, the branch supports for subclades were less stringent. clade  <dig> contains proteins with almost the exact same domain structures all from closely related species; therefore, subclades were not defined for this clade. four proteins  did not fall clearly into any clades; rather they fell between clades or next to proteins from widely divergent species . therefore, they have not been included in any of the defined clades. dictyostelium ddb <dig> contains two wwe domains and a cwf15/cwc <dig> domain. wwe domains are postulated to be protein-protein interaction domains and are found in proteins involved in the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway and in parps  <cit> . cwf15/cwc <dig> domains are of unknown function and found in splicing factors  <cit> . naegleria gruberi is a member of the heterolobosea within the eukaryotic group excavates . heterolobosea are protozoa, many of which, including naegleria gruberi, can transform between amoeboid, flagellate, and encysted stages. naegleria gruberi is the only member of this group of organisms with a completed genome, making it impossible to determine if these genes are representative of ones found in a wide range of heterolobosea species or are more specific to naegleria and its relatives. the two naegleria parp-like proteins are relatively short proteins with the parp catalytic domain at their very c termini. their n termini contain no known functional domains. the function of these proteins remains obscure, although they retain the "hye" catalytic triad , and may act as bona fide parps. c. elegans pme <dig> has been characterized as a tankyrase  <cit>  and does share ankyrin repeats in its n terminus with those proteins, which are found in clade  <dig>  the placement of this protein outside of the defined clades likely reflects the large changes found in c. elegans parps .

the parp lineages  include one clade, clade  <dig>  which contains representatives from five of the six so-called eukaryotic supergroups: plantae, opisthokonts, chromalveolates, excavates, and amoebozoa . there is no completely sequenced species available from the sixth supergroup, rhizaria. this broad distribution suggests that the last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes encoded a gene similar to those of clade  <dig>  clade  <dig> is only found in three of the eukaryotic supergroups; however, the position of this clade as sister group to all other members of the parp superfamily and the placement of these groups within eukaryotes supports the hypothesis that the last common eukaryote also encoded such a gene .

clade 1: the parp <dig> clade
clade  <dig> is the most broadly distributed parp clade among eukaryotes . the distribution of clade <dig> proteins among eukaryotic species suggests that there was at least one clade 1-like parp protein encoded in the genome of their last common ancestor. this group of parps can be subdivided into nine subclades . almost all members of clade  <dig> are characterized by the presence of wgr and parp regulatory domains  in addition to the parp catalytic domains, one of the reasons we placed these proteins together . the wgr domain is found in parps as well an escherichia coli molybdate metabolism regulator and other proteins of unknown function. its exact function is unclear, but it is proposed to be a nucleic acid binding domain. the prd domain is found only in clade  <dig> parp proteins and has been shown to increase the polyation activity of proteins that contain it. consistent with the presence of prd domains, many members of clade  <dig> have been demonstrated to have polyation activity, making it likely that most if not all members have this activity; this is also supported by the finding that the so-called hye catalytic triad is conserved in almost all of these proteins . another commonality between members of clade  <dig> is that many of them have been shown to have roles in dna repair. other common domains found in clade  <dig> proteins are zinc finger dna binding domains, brct domains and padr <dig> domains. the brct domain, originally identified in the c terminus of the brca- <dig> protein, is usually found in proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and/or dna repair  <cit> . the padr <dig> domain is found only in parps  and is of unknown function  <cit> .

clade 1a is found in amoebozoa , opisthokonta  and chromalveolates  and is the sister group to most of the other clade  <dig> subclades . this subclade is unique within clade  <dig> in containing proteins with ankyrin repeats, in addition to wgr, prd and parp catalytic domains. clade 1b contains members from both the opisthokonta  and the excavata . this subclade is typified by human parp <dig>  the founding member of the superfamily. this protein has three n terminal zinc fingers that contribute to dna binding, a brct domain and a padr <dig> domain in addition to wgr, prd, and the catalytic domain .

both clade 1c and 1d both contain proteins that have in common wgr, prd and parp catalytic domains and mostly do not contain other functional domains. clade 1c is confined to several oomyocete phytophtora species  and one basal animal. clade 1d contains members from opisthokonta  and schistosoma japonicum  and the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and plantae  as well as ciliate members of the chromalveolates. some of the land plant members of clade 1d have acquired sap domains dna binding domains  <cit>  n terminal to the other domains . in addition, the land plant members of this group have altered their catalytic triad, alone among clade  <dig> members . all the plant proteins have a cysteine in place of the histidine while all except for the moss protein have a valine instead of the tyrosine in the second position. however, the plant clade 1d proteins have retained the glutamic acid in the third position. it is unclear what effect these changes might have on the catalytic activity of these proteins.

clade 1e contains most of the fungal members of clade  <dig> and is characterized by proteins with brct domains n terminal to wgr, prd and parp catalytic domains. clade 1f is specific to the excavata. the toxoplasma gondii representative  has a similar domain structure to human parp <dig>  found in clade 1b. clade 1g is confined to the opisthokonta , contains proteins with only wgr, prd and parp catalytic domains and includes human parp <dig> 

all five eukaryotic supergroups that contain sequenced species are represented in clade 1h . this clade includes human parp <dig>  interestingly, land plants have duplicated one of their clade 1h genes; one duplicate lineage appears to be changing rapidly, based on the long-branch length in the phylogenetic tree . these proteins may have acquired a novel function or the original function may have been split between the two copies in these species , as these processes are hypothesized to increase the probability of retention of duplicate genes  <cit> .

the final subclade in clade  <dig>  clade 1i, consists of two caenorhabditis elegans  proteins, pme <dig> and pme <dig>  which have been characterized previously  <cit> . pme <dig> contains zinc fingers and padr <dig>  wgr, prd and parp domains, while pme <dig> only has wgr, prd and parp domains. as will be discussed further below, many of the nematode proteins are anomalous.

clade 2: the rcd <dig> clade
clade  <dig> of parp-like genes consists of proteins identified only in land plants, with representatives found from bryophytes to angiosperms , a finding that has also been made by another group  <cit> . however, there is no genomic information available for any member of the streptophyte algae, the sister group to land plants within plantae, leaving open the possibility that members of this clade may be found in these organisms . all groups of land plants also contain members of clade  <dig> parps, while the moss physcomitrella patens contains clade  <dig> proteins in addition .

the founding member of this type of parp-like protein, radical-induced cell death  <dig> , was identified in a genetic screen in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana for genes involved in cell death in response to ozone  <cit>  and has been shown to be involved in response to a number of abiotic stresses  <cit> . other members of this clade have subsequently been identified based on sequence similarity and several are also involved in stress response  <cit> . clade  <dig> is made up two subclades . clade 2a consists of proteins that have, in common with rcd <dig>  an n terminal wwe domain, the parp signature and a c terminal extension  and are found throughout the breadth of the land plants . clade 2b is apparently eudicot specific  and consists of relatively short proteins with only the parp signature and the c terminal extension . although clade 2a proteins contain wwe domains, they do not group with another group of wwe containing parps, which fall into clade  <dig>  a clade with no plant representatives . rcd <dig> has recently been shown to be enzymatically inactive, a result consistent with the lack of conservation of many of the catalytic residues within the parp domain .

one interesting observation we made concerning clade  <dig> was the large number of independent gene duplications that have occurred within this gene lineage . while this is likely due to the propensity of plant genomes to undergo whole genome duplications , the retention of many of the gene pairs suggests that clade  <dig> proteins are undergoing neofunctionalization and/or subfunctionalization at a high rate  <cit> . this supposition is supported for a pair of clade 2a paralogs in arabidopsis thaliana, rcd <dig> and similar to rcd one  <dig> , which have been shown to be only partially redundant despite a relatively recent evolutionary origin  <cit> .

clade 3
clade  <dig> contains proteins from three of the six eukaryotic supergroups: opisthokonts , amoebozoa  and chromalveolates  . this clade is likely to be somewhat artificial; the domain structures outside of the parp catalytic domain are heterogeneous among clade  <dig> proteins and the presence of tetrahymena thermophila sequences within a group that otherwise contains opisthokonts and amoebozoa  is unlikely to be real. these proteins do share certain characteristics in their catalytic domains suggestive of a switch from parp activity to mart activity. parp family members have catalytic domains containing the "hye" catalytic triad conserved throughout the adpr transferase superfamily  <cit> . the third residue, normally a glutamic acid, is not conserved in most clade  <dig> members , with only one of its members retaining this residue , while a second has a glutamine . most members of the clade have substituted the aliphatic amino acids isoleucine, valine, methionine or leucine for the glutamic acid, while one tetrahymena protein  as well as human parp <dig> and its vertebrate orthologs have threonine or serine at this position. these substitutions have consequences for the catalytic activity of these proteins; these proteins likely do not have polyation activity  <cit> . it is likely that the grouping of at least the tetrahymena proteins into this clade is a result of convergent evolution of mart activity.

given the heterogeneous composition of clade  <dig>  it is difficult to divide into subclades; however, we classified the proteins into six subclades as outlined below, partially for the purpose of discussion, and partially based on common domain structures and features of the catalytic domains . clade 3a is composed of two proteins, including human parp <dig>  containing an rrm rna binding domain  <cit> , a glycine-rich region , and a uim domain, known to bind monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains  <cit> . the proteins found in clade 3b and 3c contain at least one macro domain n terminal to their c terminal catalytic domain . macro domains have been shown to bind to poly   <cit> . clade 3b includes representatives from the most basal animal in our study trichoplax adhaerens, while 3c includes two human proteins, parp <dig> and parp <dig>  parp <dig>  parp <dig> and parp <dig> have been demonstrated to have mart activity  <cit> .

clade 3d consists of the two dictyostelium discoideum and four tetrahymena thermophila proteins. unlike the majority of animal proteins in clade  <dig>  only one of these proteins have a proline located one amino acid away from the third residue of the catalytic triad . the four proteins from the ciliate tetrahymena thermophilia have no known functional domains outside of their c terminal parp catalytic domains and are only similar to one another in this region , again supporting the idea that these proteins are not closely evolutionarily related to the other proteins in clade  <dig>  one of the tetrahymena proteins has retained the glutamic acid of the "hye" , again supporting this interpretation. all four proteins also share a h/nnsk motif just past the last amino acid of the putative catalytic triad not found in other members of clade  <dig> . the dictyostelium proteins in 3d do not show high similarity outside of the parp domain. ddb <dig> is a relatively short protein with only the parp catalytic domain and a short c terminal extension. ddb <dig> has a macro domain and, at its very n terminus, a u-box . the u-box is a modified ring finger  <cit>  found in e <dig> ubiquitin ligases known to bind ubiquitin e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . as amoebozoa is the sister group to opisthokonts within eukaryotes and given that ddb <dig> contains a macro domain as do some other members of clade  <dig>  it is possible that these proteins are orthologous to at least some of the animal clade  <dig> proteins.

clade 3e is confined to animals, but is not represented in placozoa . members of this subclade contain one to two wwe domains, alone or in combination with zinc fingers  in front of their parp catalytic domains . all members of 3e have replaced the glutamic acid characteristic of parps with an isoleucine except for two  that contain valines at that site . this subclade also contains human parp <dig> and human parpt/parp <dig> 

clade 3f, which is sister group to all other clade  <dig> subclades, contains human parp <dig> and orthologs from vertebrates. these proteins contain two macro domains n terminal to their parp catalytic domains  and have a more divergent catalytic triad than the rest of clade  <dig>  having q-y/s-t/s instead of hye . human parp <dig> has been shown to be inactive  <cit> , suggesting that no clade 3f proteins act as enzymes. parp <dig> was originally identified as a gene conferring risk for diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and named bal <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, two proteins identified by their similarity to bal <dig>  parp14/bal <dig> and parp15/bal <dig>  although their domain structures resemble that of parp9/bal <dig>  group in subclade 3c , and act as marts  <cit> .

clade 4: the tankyrase clade
clade  <dig> proteins are characterized by fifteen to eighteen ankyrin repeats followed by a sterile alpha motif , most likely a protein-protein interaction domain  <cit> , and the parp catalytic domain . these proteins are so similar to one another that we have not further subdivided them . the two human members of this clade, tankyrase <dig> and tankyrase <dig>  have been shown to have polyation activity  <cit> . all proteins grouped in this clade retain the "hye" catalytic triad , suggesting that they are likely to be active enzymes.

our analysis indicates true tankyrases are confined to animals, and in fact do not appear to be found outside of the bilateria . a duplication event that generated two tankyrase-encoding genes appears to have occurred within the vertebrates, sometime after the separation of the amphibians. the absence of tankyrase orthologs outside of the animals contradicts the report of such proteins in protozoa such as dictyostelium discoideum and tetrahymena thermophila  <cit> . however, these protozoan proteins differ from the canonical tankyrases in structure; although they have ankyrin repeats in their n terminal region, these are followed by wgr and prd domains rather than a sam motif . consistent with the presence of the wgr and prd domains and the low similarity between their parp catalytic domain and that of tankyrases, these proteins fall into clade 1a . this suggests that parp proteins independently acquired ankyrin repeats at least twice.

clade 5: the vparp clade
clade  <dig> is found only in the opishthokonts  and amboezoa  and is characterized by the position of the parp catalytic domain. in this group, the parp signature is found in the middle of the protein, rather than at the c terminus and is typified by human vparp/parp <dig>  vparp has the catalytic domain preceded by a brct domain and followed by a vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin  domain, and a von willebrand factor type a domain  . both vit and vwa domains are commonly found in proteins of multiprotein complexes and are structurally related to each other  <cit> . clade  <dig> is further subdivided into two subclades . clade 5a contains animal proteins while clade 5b contains two proteins from the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum . the amoeba proteins have a different protein structure than the animal members of this clade; they too have brct domains n terminal to their parp catalytic domains and long c terminal extensions. however, there are no vit or vwa domains found in these proteins.

vparp is associated with vaults, very large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles first described in the 1980s whose function is unclear  <cit> . vaults have a patchy taxonomic distribution within eukaryotes. our analysis suggests that the phylogenetic distribution of vparp is also limited ; members of clade 5a with the vparp domain structure are found only in animals that have been shown to contain vaults, while clade 5b proteins are found in dictyostelium, which also contains vaults  <cit> . however, although vaults have been identified in trypanosomes  <cit> , no evidence of proteins sharing the domain structure of vparp can be found in this group of organisms, although such proteins may be present in species with currently unsequenced genomes.

mart activity may be ancient
clade  <dig> proteins are found in opisthokonts , excavates , and plantae  . based on its position as sister group to all other clades of parps  and the distribution of species containing clade  <dig> parps within the eukaryotes , it is likely that the last common eukaryotic ancestor had at least one clade 6-like protein encoded in its genome. this clade is characterized by n termini with no known functional domains and c terminal extensions beyond the parp catalytic domain of varying lengths. almost all of these proteins contain a pfamb_ <dig> domain immediately before their parp catalytic domain , although the function or significance of this domain is unknown, supporting the placement of these proteins in a single clade. another characteristic of clade  <dig> members is changes within the parp catalytic domain. none of the clade  <dig> proteins we identified contain the final glutamic acid of the hye catalytic triad, although they mostly retain the histidine and tyrosine . this might lead to an inability to catalyze polyation. in fact, the human proteins in this clade  have been predicted to have monoation activity based on structural models  <cit> , although this awaits experimental confirmation. none of the clade  <dig> parps have been functionally characterized.

clade  <dig> can be subdivided into five groups . clade 6a contains fungal proteins exclusively . these proteins consist of a long n terminal region containing no known functional domains, a pfamb_ <dig> domain, the parp catalytic domain, and a c terminal extension containing an ubcc . the ubcc domain is the catalytic domain contained in e <dig> ub-conjugating enzymes   <cit> . these enzymes carry ub and transfer it either directly to a substrate in cooperation with an e <dig> enzyme or to the e <dig> ub-ligase. an active cysteine residue  <cit>  characterizes the ubcc domain and is found in clade 6a proteins . in addition, these proteins also share a number of residues conserved across a range of ubcc and ubcc-like domains . these include the residues making up the proline-hydrophobic side chain interaction at the top of the so-called e <dig> fold flap, and a chain of interacting residues at the bottom of the flap . these residues have been implicated in the mechanical structure of the e <dig> fold  <cit> . although it is unusual for e <dig> enzymes to have multiple functional domains, there is at least one other family of such enzymes, the bruce-like family, which has multiple domains. these proteins are large  and contain baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeats  in their n termini, followed by a large region of unknown function, and a ubcc domain at their c termini  <cit> .

no other known functional domains can be identified in clade 6a proteins; however, most of these proteins do share another pfamb domain,  <dig>  at their very n termini  <cit> . this domain is confined to fungal species and appears to only occur in clade 6a family members with the exception of a protein from the fungus uncinocarpus reesii  that consists only of this domain . pfam-b_ <dig> averages  <dig> amino acids in length and has some secondary structure similarity to the rwd domain when modelled using the protein homology/analogy recognition engine , and is predicted to form an alpha helix/beta strand/alpha helix/beta strand/alpha helix structure . the rwa domain has some structural similarity to the ubcc domain  <cit> , further providing a link between the clade 6a proteins and ub. the rwa domain is thought to mediate non-catalytic protein-protein interactions. we propose renaming the pfam-b_ <dig> domain fpe, for fungal parp e2-associated.

clade 6b proteins are found in a subset of green algae . these proteins have no other domains of known function but do contain pfamb_ <dig> domains as well as the parp catalytic domain. green algae have not previously been shown to have any parp-like proteins encoded in their genomes. clade 6c proteins are animal specific and are found in species from across this group, including human . again, other than a pfamb_ <dig> domain and a parp catalytic domain, no other obvious protein motifs are present. clade 6d is confined to deuterostomes with the exception of the mollusc lottia gigantea. these proteins consist of no identifiable domains other than a pfamb_ <dig> domain and the parp catalytic domain . human parp <dig> and parp <dig> are found within this group of proteins.

clade 6e consist of seven proteins encoded by trichomonas vaginalis, the only member of the parabasalids  with a fully sequenced genome and one fungal protein . trichomonas is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis in humans; without other completed genomes available for the parabasalids, it is impossible to determine if members of clade 6e are found elsewhere in this group. besides the parp catalytic domain, the only other identified domain in these proteins is a pfamb_ <dig> domain. the nectria haematocca protein does not have a pfamb_ <dig> domain or any known functional domain.

phylogenetic analysis suggest multiple independent losses of parp genes across the eukaryotes
although the five supergroups of eukaryotes with genome information contain organisms with parp-encoding genes in their genome, some lineages appear to have lost all parp genes . for example, in plantae the sequenced genomes available for three red algae and a subset of green algae do not encode any parp genes , although it is possible that such genes may be present in other species not yet sequenced. the complement of parp proteins present can differ even between closely related species; for example, the green algae chlorella sp. nc64a contains a clade  <dig> parp representative while chlorella vulgaris does not . diatoms and brown algae  do not appear to have parps, nor do the sequenced members of the excavates group diplomonads. while the sequenced species represent only a small amount of the diversity in these groups of organisms, the lack of parp genes suggests that these lineages have lost parps and, further, demonstrate that these genes are not absolutely essential for eukaryotic life.

species listed have had their genomes individually searched by blast to determine if any parp proteins were present. ncbi, national center for biotechnology information; jgi, department of energy joint genome institute.

the fungal lineages within the opisthokonts provide a particularly interesting pattern of gene loss. this group of organisms contain clade  <dig> and  <dig> parp proteins, and based on the phylogenetic distribution of these genes, the fungal ancestor contained proteins representing both clades . however, not all current fungal groups or species have both types of parps and some do not encode parp genes at all . for example, the two major model fungal species, saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe, do not have parps. it appears that there have been at least five independent losses of parps within the fungi. the basal fungi are not well represented by sequenced genomes, however within the mucorales the genomes of three species have been sequenced and two have clade  <dig> parps  while the other has none . the basidiomycota has had at least two losses of parps; one loss has occurred within the pucciniomycotina and one within the agaricomycotina. only two species within the pucciniomycotina are represented in our analysis and neither encodes parp proteins . within the agaricomycotina, there appear to have been two losses of parps. both clade  <dig> and  <dig> parps are found in some species within this group of basidiomycota; however, postia placenta  has retained only a clade  <dig> parp while heterobasidion annosum  has lost both types of parps . the ascomycota are the fungal group including the most species with sequenced genomes and have both clade  <dig> and  <dig> parps . this group has seen at least two independent losses of parps. the taphrinomycotina  contain no parp genes while none of the saccharomycotina has clade  <dig> proteins and only a basal member of this group, yarrowia lipolytica, retains clade  <dig> proteins . interestingly, as previously noted by other groups  <cit> , parps or parp-like proteins are mostly retained in fungi that have multicellular hyphae and/or elaborate developmental programs, but not in yeasts .

discussion
evolutionary history of the parp family
the broad distribution of parps across the eukaryotes indicates that the last common eukaryotic ancestor  had genes encoding members of this protein family. clade  <dig> parps are found in all five eukaryotic supergroups for which sequence information is available; this implies that the lcea encoded at least one enzyme of this type, and may have had multiple members . based on the domain structure of modern clade  <dig> proteins, we hypothesize that the clade  <dig> enzyme or enzymes found in the lcea consisted of wgr, prd, and parp catalytic domains .

members of clade  <dig> have been characterized in a range of organisms, encompassing three of the six eukaryotic supergroups. while a wide range of functions has been described for these parps, most characterized members of clade  <dig> have been implicated in or demonstrated to have roles in dna damage response and repair. in plantae, two of the arabidopsis thaliana clade  <dig> members, atparp <dig> and atparp <dig>  have been shown to be induced by dna damage and be involved in the response to it  <cit> . in the opisthokonts, several animal clade  <dig> members have been investigated and shown to be involved in dna repair. this is a well-known function for the human clade  <dig> members, parp <dig>  parp <dig>  and parp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a fungal protein, prpa from aspergillus nidulans, has been shown to act early in the dna damage response  <cit> , while loss of its ortholog from neurospora crassa, npo, causes sensitivity to dna damage and acceleration of replicative aging  <cit> . within the excavates, a trypanosoma cruzi clade  <dig> member, tcparp, has been shown to be induced in response by dna damage, be enzymatically activated by nicked dna and to require dna for catalytic activity  <cit> . clade  <dig> members in the chromalveolates and the amoebozoa have not been functionally characterized, but are also likely to function in dna damage response. dictyostelium discoideum in the amoebozoa has at least four clade  <dig> proteins encoded in its genome . drug studies have implicated parp activity in oxidative stress response and dna damage in this organism  <cit> , but no direct evidence of which parp or parps is involved has been published. the ubiquitous distribution of clade  <dig> members and the consistent association of the proteins with dna damage response suggests that this gene lineage is ancient and that the original function of this family was in dna repair and genome integrity.

while clade  <dig> is found in only three of the five eukaryotic supergroups with available genome information , the phylogenetic relationship of these groups within eukaryotes suggests that a clade 6-like protein was found in the lcea . subsequently, during the eukaryotic radiation, amoebozoa  and chromalveolates lost clade  <dig> parps. the ancestral clade  <dig> protein was likely to consist of a pfamb_ <dig> domain n terminal to the parp catalytic domain . members of clade  <dig> were more difficult to identify than other parps; it was necessary to do supplemental blast searches with the human parp <dig> catalytic domain to find most of these proteins . this is consistent with the positioning of clade  <dig> as sister group to the rest of the parp superfamily. the fact that clade  <dig> parps represent an ancient lineage further suggests that changes in the parp catalytic domain likely to eliminate or change enzymatic activity evolved early in this protein family or, alternatively, parp activity evolved from mart activity. it is difficult to speculate on the possible function of the clade  <dig> ancestral protein, as none of the extant clade  <dig> members have been functionally characterized.

one group of parps defined in our study has an unusual distribution. clade  <dig> is found in animals , dictylostelium discoideum  and the ciliate tetrahymena thermophila , but no other species in our analysis, including the ciliate paramecium tetraurelia. our phylogenetic tree is based on the parp catalytic domain. clade  <dig> proteins have evolved to become either marts or non-enzymatic . we propose that the grouping of the tetrahymena proteins in clade  <dig> is an artefact caused by this group of proteins independently beginning to evolve similar changes in the parp catalytic domain. clades  <dig> and  <dig> independently acquired somewhat similar changes, supporting the idea that changes within the parp catalytic domain may be constrained in order to preserve overall structure. the hypothesis that the tetrahymena proteins are not closely related to the other clade  <dig> proteins is supported by the fact that one of them  retains the glutamic acid of the parp catalytic triad, while another  has a conservative substitution of a glutamine at that position and that they do not share any domains outside of the catalytic domain with other members of clade  <dig>  when more sequences within the ciliates become available, it may become possible to determine if this hypothesis is correct. the dictyostelium proteins found in clade  <dig> may be orthologous to the animal proteins, since one of them has a macro domain, a domain found in other members of this clade .

in extant eukaryotes, the animal lineage within opisthokonta appears to have the most diverse collection of parps. most animal genomes encode representatives of at least two clades of parps. in addition, a parp clade has been acquired in this lineage, clade  <dig> . vertebrates contain the highest number and type of parps of any group examined within the eukaryotes, containing members of clades  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6; additionally they often encode more than one representative of each clade. however, within animals the nematodes are unusual. c. elegans, within the order rhabditida, only encodes two clade 1i proteins, pme <dig> and pme <dig> , and a protein  that did not clearly fall into any clade . within clade  <dig>  the nematode 1i parps do not group with other animal parps but rather are found as the sister group to all of the clade  <dig> proteins. pme <dig> somewhat resembles tankyrases in domain structure but does not group with them. however, the branches leading to the c. elegans proteins are long. the length of these branches likely results in long-branch effects, causing misplacement of these proteins within the tree. such long-branch effects can be caused by the independent acquisition of identical character states  <cit> , phylogenetic signal erosion   <cit> , or by symplesiomorphy   <cit> . in contrast to the situation in c. elegans, we were unable to identify any clade  <dig> parps in the nematode brugia malayi, in the order spirudida, but did identify a clear tankyrase . the nematodes are clearly outliers within the animal lineage and a closer examination of the parp family across a greater number of such species would be interesting.

although parps are found throughout the eukaryotes, these proteins are not essential for eukaryotic life. this is illustrated most clearly in the fungal lineage within the opisthokonta. in contrast to their fellow opisthokont lineage the animals, fungi encode members of only clades  <dig> and  <dig> parps . lineages within the fungi have independently lost parps at least five times, illustrating that eukaryotic organisms do not absolutely require this family of proteins. in addition, it should be noted that none of the fungal species examined retained clade  <dig> parps in the absence of clade  <dig> parps. this underscores the relative importance of the so-called "classical" clade  <dig> parps in these organisms. interestingly, many of the fungi that have lost all parps, including the model fungal systems saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe, are yeasts. this suggests fungi with more complex life cycles may retain parps more readily than yeasts do. it is possible that a selective advantage is found in organisms with relatively rapid generation times in dispensing with this class of proteins. this is supported by the retention of clade  <dig> parps in the basal saccharomycia fungus yarrowia lipolytica while the two other sequenced members of this fungal group have lost all parps . yarrowia can grow in three forms: as yeast, hyphae and pseudohyphae. candida albicans, also a saccharomyces member, is trimorphic but lacks parps; however, this diploid organism lacks a known sexual cycle, suggesting a simplification of its life cycle. sacchromyces cerevisiae is only dimorphic, growing only as yeast or pseudohyphae . other groups have noted the association of retention of parps with filamentous growth  <cit> . this correlation is also found in the dimorphic human pathogen histoplasma capsulatum, the cause of histoplasmosis, which grows as either yeast or hyphae. in this organism, we have found that its clade 6a parp gene is expressed only during the filamentous growth stage and not when the fungus is growing in the yeast form .

our conclusions about the function and distribution of parp proteins in the eukaryotes are limited by the availability of species with sequenced genomes. currently, there is a dearth of sequences available in many groups of eukaryotes while animals, particularly vertebrates, and fungi are relatively well represented. a number of phylogenetically important groups such as streptophyte algae, glaucophytes, phaeophytes, dinoflagellates, and archamoebe have no sequenced genomes. the eukaryotic supergroup amoebozoa is represented by only one species, dictyostelium discoideum, while there are no representatives of rhizaria sequenced. despite the limitations of the available sequences, we have identified unique types of parps in naegleria gruberi, trichomonas vaginalis and green algae and clarified the phylogenetic distribution of tankyrases. there are likely to be additional variations of parps discovered as more eukaryotic genomes are sequenced and a further advancement of our understanding of evolution of this important proteins superfamily.

clade  <dig> and vaults
the clade  <dig> parps have a limited phylogenetic distribution, found only in a subset of animals and amoeba . vparp was originally identified in a two-hybrid screen using the major vault protein  protein as bait and shown to act as a bona fide parp  <cit> . vparp associates not only with the ribonucleoprotein vault complex, but also can be found in the nucleus, associated with the telomere and the mitotic spindle. the function of vparp at any of its locations is unclear. vaults have been best studied in mammals and in these organisms are composed of three proteins, mvp, tel <dig> , and vparp. in addition, several vault specific rnas  are found. the function or functions of vaults are still unclear; they are associated with drug resistance and several signalling pathways , as well as the nuclear pore complex  <cit> . vparp-deficient mice are normal and fertile with no defects in telomeres or vaults  <cit> . more recently these mice have been found to develop more tumours in response to carcinogens, suggesting a role in chemically induced cancers  <cit> .

vaults have been identified in diverse animals and in other eukaryotes such as the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum, flatworms, and trypanosomatides  <cit> . however, vaults appear to be missing from fungi, a number of model animals  and in plants  <cit> .

the fact that vparp does not appear essential for normal development or vault structure in mouse  <cit>  suggests that this protein is not essential for vault function. this may explain why organisms that have been demonstrated to contain vaults in their cells do not always encode proteins that look like vparp.

clade  <dig> plant-specific parps are involved in stress responses
in addition to containing three clade  <dig> parps throughout and clade  <dig> parps only in the bryophytes, the land plants contain a unique clade of parp-like proteins. this clade can be subdivided into two subclades, one of which contains proteins with an n terminal wwe domain. clade  <dig> is distinct from clade  <dig>  which also contains proteins with wwe domains. a group within clade  <dig>  confined to the eudicots within the angiosperms, consists of truncated proteins lacking the n terminal wwe domain. examination of the phylogeny of clade  <dig> clearly illustrates the importance of genome duplication during plant evolution  <cit> ; plant species tend to encode gene pairs .

the plant clade  <dig> proteins have only been investigated in the model angiosperm arabidopsis thaliana. arabidopsis has two genes, rcd <dig> and sro <dig>  which encode full-length members of clade 2a  <cit> . rcd <dig> was originally identified as a stress response gene  <cit> . it is involved in the response to several abiotic stresses and shows altered hormone accumulation and gene expression  <cit> . rcd <dig> mutants also display pleiotropic developmental defects including reduced stature, malformed leaves, and early flowering  <cit> . loss of sro <dig> causes only minor defects; however rcd1; sro <dig> double mutants are severely affected with a majority of individuals dying during embryogenesis  <cit> , indicating that this clade of parp proteins has essential functions in land plants. rcd <dig> has been shown to bind to a number of transcription factors, suggesting that clade  <dig> parps may function in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . rcd <dig> does not appear to have catalytic activity, consistent with the absence of the hye catalytic triad in this protein ; however, other members of this clade do contain variant hye motifs that may confer activity . therefore, it will be necessary to test individual members of this clade for activity.

four genes in arabidopsis, sro2- <dig>  encode proteins within clade  <dig> that lack the n terminal wwe domain  <cit>  and consist of two gene pairs: sro2/sro <dig> and sro4/sro <dig> . these genes may be involved in stress signalling; sro <dig> is necessary for response to both salt and oxidative stress  <cit>  and can bind transcription factors  <cit>  and sro <dig> is up regulated in chloroplastic ascorbic peroxidase mutants  <cit> .

multiple independent acquisitions of mart activity within the parp superfamily
although not closely evolutionarily related , the proteins belonging to clades  <dig> and  <dig> have modified their catalytic domains, replacing the glutamic acid of the "hye" catalytic triad with various other amino acids . the catalytic activity of several human members of clade  <dig> has been experimentally investigated. parp <dig>  which falls into clade 3a and has an isoleucine instead of a glutamic acid in its catalytic site, has been reported to have autoation activity and modify core histones  <cit> . more recently it was shown to have monoation activity, not polyation activity, and therefore function as a mono transferase  rather than a parp  <cit> . molecular modelling suggested that this enzyme uses substrate-assisted catalysis in order to activate the nad+ substrate. this group further demonstrated that parp14/bal <dig>  a clade 3c member with a leucine in place of the glutamic acid, also has mart activity, consistent with an earlier paper demonstrating autoation activity  <cit> . a human member of clade 3f, parp9/bal <dig>  has not only replaced the glutamic acid within the catalytic parp signature but have also replaced the histidine . this enzyme has been shown to be inactive  <cit> . almost all of the proteins comprising both clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> have replaced at least the glutamic acid of the "hye" triad. it is likely that none of these proteins function as bone fide parps but rather are either marts or are no longer enzymatically active. clade  <dig> has a limited taxonomic distribution ; clade  <dig>  on the other hand, is found in at least three of the six eukaryotic supergroups and was likely present in the lcea . this suggests that the evolution of mart activity within the parp gene family occurred before the full complement of crown groups had formed. in addition, the changes in the catalytic domain of the clade  <dig> proteins also suggest that these proteins have altered enzymatic activities . therefore, it is likely that mart activity and/or loss of enzymatic activity has evolved at least twice from parp activity  and that mart activity in extant clade  <dig> proteins represents an even earlier acquisition of this enzymatic activity.

what functions do parp-like/mart proteins play? while no members of clade  <dig> have been characterized, several members of clade  <dig> have, all in mammalian systems. parp9/bal <dig>  parp14/bal <dig>  and parp15/bal <dig> have been shown to interact with transcription factors and mediate transcriptional repression or activation  <cit> . parp13/zcc2/zap has been shown to bind to viral rna through its zinc fingers and promote degradation of the rna by the exosome  <cit> . parp <dig> shares significant similarity to parp <dig> and is thought to function similarly. parp <dig> interacts with myc and inhibits transformation; its overexpression leads to a loss of cell viability  <cit> . to date, no clear consensus about the function of clade  <dig> proteins can be formulated.

true tankyrases are confined to animals
human tankyrase <dig> was originally identified as a telomeric protein interacting with trf <dig>  a negative regulator of telomere length. it was shown to act as a parp and automodify itself as well as trf <dig>  <cit> . a second human tankyrase, tankyrase <dig> , was identified shortly after the initial discovery of tankyrase <dig>  <cit> . human tankyrases can be found both in the nucleus  <cit> , at the nuclear pore and centrosome  <cit> , and in the cytoplasm associated with the golgi or vesicles  <cit>  or the plasma membrane  <cit> . since their initial discovery, the known functions of these proteins have expanded to include spindle assembly and vesicle trafficking , sister chromatid segregation  <cit> , and regulation of the wnt pathway  <cit> . tankyrases have been identified in a number of animal species, including mouse. in this model organism, it appears tankyrase may not function in telomere length control  <cit> , but its other functions are conserved and its function is essential  <cit> . consistent with functions outside of the telomere, a tankyrase is found in drosophila melanogaster , an organism with a highly divergent telomere consisting of transposons rather than the short repeats found in other eukaryotes  <cit> .

our phylogenetic tree places a number of proteins previously reported as tankyrases in clade  <dig>  rather than within clade  <dig> . these proteins do have a different domain structure than tankyrases, sharing ankyrin repeats with tankyrases but having wgr and prd domains rather than sam motifs . it is likely that the clade  <dig> ankyrin repeat proteins do not share functions with tankyrases.

pme <dig> from c. elegans was reported as a tankyrase and has been functionally characterized. as mentioned above, this protein does not clearly group with any clade, including clade  <dig> . in the original paper describing pme <dig>  it was shown to be more closely related to a dictyostelium discoideum protein we have placed in clade 1a  and to have a higher similarity within the catalytic domain to human parp <dig> than human tankyrase  <cit> . in addition, the induction of pme <dig> expression by dna damaging agents, the increased apoptosis in pme <dig> lines after dna-damage, and the constitutively nuclear chromatin-associated localization of pme <dig>  <cit>  is more consistent with a role in dna damage. however, the difficulty in placing c. elegans parps into clades complicates the issue. further work will need to be done to determine the function of pme <dig> 

connections between ubiquitination, sumoylation and polyation
the attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is an important mechanism in regulating many cellular processes. similarly to adp-ribosylation, one to many ubiquitin units can be added to proteins, although only on lysine resides. a chain consisting of at least four ubiquitin linked together by lys <dig> residues causes destruction of the protein via the 26s proteasome  <cit> , while either monubiquitination or polyubiquitination with chains linked at lys <dig> serve as nonproteolytic signals in such processes as trafficking, dna repair, and signal transduction  <cit> . ubiquitination of proteins involves an enzymatic cascade involving ubiqutin-activating , ubiquitin-conjugating , and ubiquitin-ligating  enzymes.

a number of connections between parp proteins and ubiquitination have emerged. one connection involves the fact that both attachment of ubiquitin and adp-ribose can be made at lysine residues, suggesting that these post-translational modifications could compete for substrates. in addition, several protein domains found in parp proteins can also be found in proteins associated with the ubiquitin system . for example, many clade  <dig> proteins have brct domains; these domains were originally identified in the brca <dig> protein. brca <dig> functions as an e <dig> ligase in a multi-protein complex in response to dna damage  <cit> . within clade  <dig>  clade 6a proteins have a ubcc domain, similar to that found in ubiquitin e2s  <cit> , at their c termini, as well as fpe domains at their n termini . this novel domain has some similarity to the rwd domain, which in turn is related to the ubcc domain, although thought to be non-catalytic. wwe domains are found in clade  <dig> and  <dig> proteins and also in certain ubiquitin e <dig> ligases  <cit> . some clade  <dig> proteins have uim domains, which can bind ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains  <cit> ; this domain is also found in the brca1-interacting protein rap <dig>  <cit> . the dictyostelium discoideum protein ddb <dig> contains a u-box , found in e <dig> ubiqutin ligases and known to bind e <dig> enzymes  <cit> .

in addition to the structural similarities found between parps and classes of ub enzymes, some functional connections are also known. human parp14/bal <dig>  a clade 3e member, has been shown to bind to the multifunctional phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine motility factor . this binding inhibits polyubiquitination of pgi/amf, stabilizing the protein  <cit> . parp <dig> in humans is regulated by ubiquitination  <cit>  and has been shown to bind to the e <dig> enzyme hubc <dig>  <cit> . proteasome-mediated proteolysis of ubiquitinated tankyrase has also been documented; this is promoted by the auto-polyation of tankyrase, which releases the protein into the cytoplasm  <cit> . this is similar to the mechanism whereby tankyrase polyates the telomeric protein trf <dig>  releasing it from the telomere, allowing its ubiquitination and degradation  <cit>  and the regulation of axin by tankyrase  <cit> . there are likely to be more connections found in the future between post-translational adp-ribosylation and ubiquitination.

recently, a connection between polyation and sumoylation has also been demonstrated. parp <dig> itself is sumoylated  <cit> , and this takes place within its automodification domain and does not regulate polyation activity  <cit> . rather, parp1's transcriptional co-activator activity is modified  <cit> . parp <dig> can also form higher order complexes and influence sumoylation of other proteins. in response to both heat shock and dna damage, human parp <dig> associates with the sumo e <dig> ligase piasy  <cit>  and this requires a par-binding motif in this protein  <cit> . upon dna damage, piasy associates with par on parp <dig> and subsequently its target nemo binds and is sumoylated by piasy, leading to nf-kappab activation  <cit> . clearly, the interplay between polyation and other post-translational modifications is just beginning to be explored.

CONCLUSIONS
we present here a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of the parp gene family that extends previous examination of this family. several main conclusions can be drawn from our study. first, the phylogenetic distribution of the parp protein family is tremendously broad across the eukaryotes, consistent with the last common ancestor of modern eukaryotes containing at least two parp-encoding genes. second, two types of parp-like proteins were present in the lcea; one likely functioned in dna repair and genomic maintenance and resembled modern members of clade  <dig>  the second probably had mart activity. third, increasing numbers and types of parp-like protein are likely to be found as more eukaryotic organisms have their genomes sequenced.
