BACKGROUND
functional genomic applications have increased the requirement for producing large protein sets including the generation of protein microarrays for mapping protein-protein, nucleic acid or small molecule interactions  <cit> , high throughput antibody generation  <cit>  and structural genomics  <cit> . although expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria is widely used, mammalian expression systems have advantages for the production of mammalian proteins, allowing correct folding or authentic post-translational modifications. the use of transient expression systems rather than stable expression systems has facilitated the rapid production of cells producing proteins of interest. there are in fact many examples where large scale transient transfection of hek-293e cells have successfully been used to produce proteins  <cit> . in our laboratory,  <dig> –  <dig> ml transient transfections of hek-293e cells routinely provide 10–1000's μg amounts of secreted protein fragments of receptor extracellular  domains . a proportion of attempted transient transfections however result in the absence of secreted protein. the ability to pre-screen multiple expression vectors for secreted protein production on a small scale and thus identify failures prior to the larger scale transfections would reduce time, cost of reagents and allow an increased number of proteins to be produced at the large scale. the method would also allow the rapid screening of different expression conditions to optimise expression including media formulation, co-expression of chaperones  <cit> , anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit>  or binding partners  <cit> . the effect of fusion partners, signal peptide sequences or truncations could also be rapidly assessed. this is particularly important during the identification of stable cell lines yielding high levels of therapeutic antibodies or proteins.

the use of suspension cells rather than adherent cells  <cit>  for a transient transfection pre-screen reduces the time required to perform the pre-screen and lends itself to direct comparison of subsequent suspension cell growth in the  <dig> –  <dig> ml shake flask cultures. the advantage of  <dig> well blocks for transient transfections is that this allows the multiple processing of expression vectors facilitating the rapid detection of expression failures. the aim of this work was to devise and implement a system for pre-screening expression vectors for positive hits prior to large scale protein production work. here we show that small scale transient transfection of mammalian suspension cells together with analysis by dot blot can be used to assess positive expression hits in a multiparallel high throughput manner.

RESULTS
vector construction
gateway cloning technology  was chosen for the generation of expression vectors making it possible to rapidly generate vectors containing the same coding sequence with different vector backbone options .  <dig> proteins representing the extracellular domains of receptors ) were chosen for this small scale transient transfection pre-screen . all are mouse proteins with the exception of the rat cd <dig> control protein . all vectors with the exception of the three control proteins contained a c-terminal rcd <dig> -his <dig> tag. brown and barclay,  <dig>  <cit>  have previously shown that fusion of the extracellular domains of receptors to rcd <dig>  can both enhance their expression and produce the proteins in a monomeric form suitable for kinetic and affinity analysis. secretion of the tagged test proteins into the culture supernatant was driven by the native signal peptide. the list includes proteins with different numbers of ig domains  and n-glycosylation sites . the genes were isolated from cdna libraries and cloned into destination vectors  using gateway recombinational cloning . the destination vector used in this study was constructed by modifying the ptt <dig> vector  <cit> . the ptt <dig> vector backbone features the epstein-barr virus  orip allowing episomal replication of the plasmid within transfected cells and an improved human cytomegalovirus  expression cassette containing an intron downstream from the promoter serving to enhance expression  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows schematic of expression vector constructs for both test and control vectors .

growth kinetics of hek-293e cells in  <dig> deep well blocks
to identify the seeding densities allowing survival and growth of hek-293e cells in  <dig> well blocks , cells were seeded at  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> or  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in a  <dig> ml culture volume. the highest viability and consistent logarithmic growth was identified at seeding densities of  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml, which produced very similar growth kinetics. cells seeded at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml showed low growth and poor viability from  <dig> hours post seeding . the rotation speed at which the cells were grown was found to be optimal at  <dig> rpm  and cells did not stay in suspension when speeds of  <dig> –  <dig> rpm were tested . the addition of  <dig>  % pluronic, a non-ionic detergent, allowed cells to continue to grow beyond  <dig> hours post seeding, presumably due to a reduction in shear stress .

the use of smaller volumes reduces both the number of cells in culture and the amount of dna required for their transient transfection. two culture volumes were tested,  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml, with cells seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in both. cell counts and cell viability were monitored from duplicate wells every  <dig> hours over a  <dig> hour period. we analysed samples in triplicate using trypan blue exclusion dye to assess cell viability. cell growth and viability in  <dig> ml culture volume closely matched that of the  <dig> ml culture volume figure 2). cell viability remained above  <dig> % in both culture volumes , cells doubled approximately every  <dig> hours in both culture volumes . all subsequent work was done using the  <dig> ml culture volume.

comparison of growth kinetics of hek-293e cells grown in block culture and  <dig> ml shake culture
the growth kinetics of cells grown in  <dig> ml culture volume in  <dig> well blocks with cells grown in  <dig> ml shake culture was compared. our standard seeding density for hek-293e cells in  <dig> ml shake culture is  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. to maintain consistency, cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in both  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml culture volumes and measured cell growth and viability every  <dig> hours for  <dig> hours. samples were analysed in triplicate using trypan blue exclusion dye to assess cell viability. cell growth characteristics in both the  <dig> well blocks and shake flask cultures were very similar at all time points analysed . in both the  <dig> ml  <dig> well blocks and  <dig> ml shake culture, from  <dig> hours post seeding  living cells began to aggregate, making accurate counting more difficult and causing the measurements to vary more than at other time points. by  <dig> hps, cells, including aggregated cells, are beginning to die and become stained with trypan blue dye. stained cells are not included in cell growth calculations which results in smaller standard deviations between counts. the reduction in total culture volume does not have an effect on cell growth and viability. in figures  <dig> and  <dig> it is clear that when cell culture density reaches approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml the cell viability starts to decrease. this is observed after  <dig> hrs  and after  <dig> hrs  due to the difference between initial seeding densities.

equivalent protein expression in small or large scale culture
twenty three different expression vectors were tested for secreted protein production following transient transfection of hek-293e cells either in large  or small  scale cultures.  <dig> ml culture volumes were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml and transfection supernatants were harvested at  <dig> hours post transfection  and analysed by fluorescent cy <dig> western blot . supernatants showed  <dig> secretion positive vectors  and  <dig> secretion negative vectors . failure to secrete is unlikely to be caused by expression from a gateway vector, which requires the translation of the attb <dig> linker  as shown in figure  <dig>  because a comparison of a gateway and non-gateway expression vector showed similar levels of expression for cd <dig> ec domain fused to rcd <dig>  . it is more likely that failure to secrete is due to a property of the protein to be expressed and reasons could include rna instability, rna secondary structure resulting in reduced translation levels, inefficient native signal peptides, susceptibility to proteolysis or the requirement of heterodimerisation for stability and secretion. the highest signal intensity was observed for vector # <dig> and the weakest positive signal intensity for vector # <dig> . small scale transfections were performed using two different seeding densities  since both these densities gave good growth kinetics in the  <dig> ml culture volume. transfection supernatants were harvested at  <dig> hpt and analysed by western blot as above. the highest levels of secreted protein were observed when the higher seeding density was used . both western blot and signal intensity data confirmed an identical pattern of expression in  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml culture volumes, the same vectors were positive and negative for secreted protein in both and the most highly expressed protein  was also the same . in most cases supernatants from both transfection culture volumes showed varying amounts of cleaved rcd <dig> tag at approx  <dig> kda. cleavage was previously observed for expression of a t cell receptor v domain – rcd <dig>  fusion  <cit> . the variable levels of cleavage observed in figure  <dig>  between different receptors, suggest that cleavage is occurring at the c-terminus of the target receptors rather than within the constant attb <dig> linker – rcd <dig> polypeptide. most proteins display a higher observed molecular weight compared with the calculated molecular weight in table  <dig> due to glycosylation. in addition, some protein bands appear diffuse. when similar proteins produced in this hek-293e system are deglycosylated they run as sharper bands on a western blot .

dot blot conditions
western blot analysis provides essential information about the successful expression of secreted protein but does not lend itself to high-throughput analysis. in order to analyse multiple samples in parallel we investigated the use of the dot blot method to provide much of the same information as western blotting. this involved immobilising proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probing with mouse anti-his-tag and anti-mouse cy <dig> labelled antibodies . prior to analysing samples by the dot blot method, various conditions for dotting samples onto nitrocellulose membrane were tested to achieve the best signal. previous attempts with supernatants and purified protein under native conditions gave uneven binding . a purified control protein, efnb <dig>  diluted in mock supernatant was analysed under native conditions and in varying concentrations  of urea to promote denaturation . a total of  <dig>  μg of protein was loaded per dot and all conditions were analysed in triplicate. the intensity of each dot, measured using imagequant software, is represented as a bar chart . immobilisation in  <dig> m urea showed similar levels to the native conditions. the highest signal was observed using  <dig> m urea and this was chosen as the condition for future dot blot analysis of purified protein and supernatants.

dot blot calibration curves
in order to validate the use of dot intensity to quantitate the amount of expressed protein, calibration curves were made using three purified control proteins, efnb2-his <dig>  mcd4-his <dig> and mcd200-rcd4-his <dig>  proteins were diluted in mock supernatant and urea was added to a final concentration of  <dig> m. the amount of protein loaded per dot varied from 0– <dig> ng and all samples were analysed in triplicate . the intensity of each dot was measured using imagequant software and calibration curves plotted. signal intensity at a given amount of protein varied, suggesting that some proteins bind to the membrane at different efficiencies but each individual protein showed a linear relationship between dot signal intensity and amount of protein per dot over the range of  <dig>  ng to  <dig> μg  for efnb2-his <dig> and  <dig> ng to  <dig> μg  for mcd4-his <dig> and mcd200-rcd4-his <dig>  fluorescence detection, despite being 10-fold less sensitive compared to chemiluminscence, gave a superior linear dynamic range  <cit> .

analysis of the  <dig> ml transfection supernatants by dot blot
supernatants from the small scale transfections were analysed by fluorescent cy <dig> dot blot. supernatants were diluted in urea to a final concentration of  <dig> m prior to loading onto the membrane. in figure  <dig>  the top half of the membrane shows the supernatants from the lower seeding density cultures and the bottom half shows supernatants from the higher seeding density cultures. as with the western blots  the higher seeding density resulted in signals higher than those seen with the lower seeding density. the dots from the bottom half of the membrane showing a positive signal were analysed using imagequant software. there were  <dig> vectors that showed secreted protein that was detectable by dot blot  and  <dig> vectors that showed no detectable secreted protein expression . again, vector # <dig> showed the highest signal intensity, however, the lowest intensity from a secretion positive vector was observed for vector # <dig> .

dot blot screen correlates with purified protein yield
the supernatants from the  <dig> ml culture supernatants were purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography  followed by a desalt step over a sephadex column and cation exchange chromatography to concentrate the protein . the yield of purified product was estimated from the area under the observed  <dig> nm absorbance peak during the sephadex column step and this was converted to the protein yield in μg using the calculated extinction coefficient for each protein  <cit> . the calculated yield values are contained in the penultimate column headed "ex-imac akta" in table  <dig>  it was found that the protein yields calculated here were usually over-estimates possibly due to some residual imidazole buffer contributing to the  <dig> nm absorbance, the shoulder absorbance of the bicine buffer or the presence of protein aggregates. selected purified proteins were also spun to remove aggregates, analysed by analytical size exclusion chromatography   and the calculated yields are shown in the last column headed "analytical sec" in table  <dig>  single peak integration was linear in the range of  <dig> –  <dig> ng using maltose binding protein  and bovine igg as standards . the proteins that showed the highest intensity of signal by dot blot  went on to be successfully purified from the large scale culture  showing the good predictive value of this system. vectors # <dig> and  <dig> were failures when analysed by western blot  but showed a weak positive hit by dot blot . vectors that showed a small visible peak of protein when run on the akta showed a lower intensity on the dot blot. these weakly positive vectors  are good candidates for larger scale  transient transfections to produce increased amounts of protein.

discussion
a number of expression systems can be used for the production of recombinant proteins. mammalian expression systems, unlike the prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic expression systems, are efficient in producing active mammalian proteins due to their post-translational processing machinery and presence of endogenous levels of binding partners that may be necessary to stabilise the expressed protein of interest. in order to achieve a high yield of protein for analysis, mammalian expression systems tend to have been based on isolated, high expression stable cell lines  <cit> . a disadvantage of this method is the time taken to establish these stable cell lines. the transient mammalian expression system described here  <cit>  has many of the benefits but does not suffer from the time constraints of stable cell line expression systems.

the ability to pre-screen expression vectors to identify those giving successful protein expression prior to large scale protein production helps to reduce time, cost and lends itself to high throughput handling of samples. the use of pre-screening with adherent cell cultures is well practiced but there is little mention in the literature of using suspension cells for pre-screening. girard et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  reported the use of a twelve-well microtiter plate agitated on a rotational shaker to grow suspension mammalian cells. they tested intracellular gfp expression and found similar expression between small scale cultures and larger cultures grown in spinner flasks or bioreactors. chambers et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  and bahia et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  have both described the use of  <dig> well blocks for the growth of insect cells in suspension and the screening of baculovirus expression constructs. recently davies et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  described a method for transient transfection of hek-293e cells in 24-well blocks with a lipid based transfection reagent and validated this by comparing with scaled up shake-flask expression for a set of intracellularly expressed kinases. we describe the use of  <dig> well blocks for pre-screening secreted proteins following transient transfection of hek-293e cells in suspension using pei. this pre-screen method lends itself to the use of liquid handling robots for dispensing cells and reagents thus speeding up the process further.

this small scale transient transfection method can yield on average  <dig> μg/ml and so could be used in cases where very small amounts of proteins are sufficient for downstream work  or could be used as a pre-screen prior to larger scale culture. we found that cells grown in  <dig> ml cultures in  <dig> well blocks mimic cell growth and viability of cells grown in  <dig> ml shake cultures. these  <dig> ml cell cultures were also successfully transfected with expression vectors using pei in the  <dig> well blocks and protein expression profiles matched those of  <dig> ml transfection cultures. the use of the dot blot method allows the screening of large numbers of samples and can be used in conjunction with the  <dig> deep well block to allow the screening of  <dig> ×  <dig> well blocks in parallel.

we found that the addition of urea helps immobilisation of proteins on the membrane. the ability of urea to unfold proteins and expose hydrophobic amino acids may make it easier for the proteins to adhere to the membrane and counteract the presence of hydrophilic glycosylated residues that interfere with binding of the protein to the membrane. e. coli mbp, which is not glycosylated, did not require urea denaturation for efficient binding to nitrocellulose . the dot-blot method is semi-quantitative when comparing different proteins due to the differential binding ability of various proteins to the membrane. even when proteins are denatured they bind to the membrane with differing efficiency. this can be seen on the dot blot calibration curves where three control proteins showed binding within a linear range but each protein bound to the membrane with varying success . there appears to be no correlation between efficiency of binding to the membrane and protein size, pi or number of glycosylation sites. however, the use of the dot blot method for quantitating multiple different constructs  could be very useful and the pre-screen and dot blot combination is useful for optimising culture conditions for a single protein.

we found that in almost every case the intensity of dots on the dot blot correlated to success of proteins being purified. the notable exception to this was # <dig>  which despite being strongly positive by dot blot narrowly failed protein purification by falling below the required  <dig> μg for peak collection. the reason for this has not been determined but might be due to the differential binding of proteins to the membrane as seen with the standard curves. it may also be explained by the lack of accessibility of the his-tag during purification under native conditions. the analysis of small scale pre-screen cultures is not limited to western blot and dot blot analysis. alternative methods to quantitate small scale expression may include bead capture via the his tag, elution, followed by quantitation of the purified protein or elisa based screens.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that small scale transfection of hek-293e cells are a scalable way to produce protein and can be performed in  <dig> deep well blocks correlating well to what is seen in larger scale transfections. the use of dot blot screening of supernatants allows the rapid identification of vectors or conditions yielding sufficient secreted protein to proceed successfully through purification when grown in a larger scale. by identifying failed constructs early, the approach reduces time, cost and labour of processing negative experiments at a large scale.
