BACKGROUND
trunk sensory neurons convey somatic and visceral information to the central nervous system . rohon-beard  cells are known to mediate the sensory pathway in fish and amphibian larvae  <cit> ; however, this cell type has not been identified in avian and mammalian species  <cit>  . in fish and amphibians, rb cells are located in the dorsal part of the spinal cord and have peripheral and central neurites. the peripheral neurites innervate the skin of the trunk, while the central neurites descend and ascend over several segments within the spinal cord, ultimately reaching the brainstem  <cit> . at later larval stages, rb cells undergo cell death by apoptosis. concomitantly, neural crest cell -derived extramedullary sensory ganglia  develop and begin to process mechanosensory inputs  <cit> . at present, evidence suggests that the body organization of cephalochordate amphioxus reflects the early primitive condition of chordate. although it lacks extramedullary sensory neurons, equivalent to drg neurons, it has two types of intramedullary neurons comparable to rb cells of anamniotes, retzius bipolar cells in larvae  <cit>  and driii cells in adult  <cit> . in agnathan lampreys, both rb cells and extramedullary sensory neurons are present, but their spinal roots are primitive and asymmetrical  <cit> . due to the ontogenic transition in anamniotes from rb cells to drg neurons and phylogenetic disappearance of rb cells in amniotes, intramedullary cells are regarded as the prototype of sensory neurons in chordates .

both rb cells and nccs arise from the cells present at the border of the neural- and non-neural ectoderm and both require similar inductive signals including bone morphogenetic proteins  <cit> . notch/delta signaling alternatively determines their fates; it promotes rb cell fate at the expense of ncc-derived cell types  <cit> . whereas nccs undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migrate to their final destinations, including drg  <cit> , rb cells migrate medially from the border and are finally incorporated into the medulla  <cit> . rb cells extend their neurites and mediate the sensory circuits required for rhythmic swimming and predator avoidance  <cit> . at the approach of metamorphosis, the functions of rb cells are superseded by drg neurons, and the death of rb cells is induced by the attenuation of trkc1/nt- <dig> signaling  <cit> . although previous studies shed light on the induction, specification and differentiation processes of rb cells in zebrafish and xenopus <cit> , the molecular mechanisms underlying the replacement of rb cells with drg neurons remain largely unknown. unveiling such mechanisms should enhance our understanding of the evolution of sensory architecture, particularly the emergence of drg in craniates and subsequent disappearance of rb cells in amniotes.

in the cranial region, the six <dig> homeobox gene is considered the main player in the genesis of sensory organs: loss of function of six <dig> causes severe defects in various sensory organs that originate from the cranial sensory placodes in zebrafish  <cit> , xenopus <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . the expression of six <dig>  another six family gene, shows a similar pattern, and simultaneous loss of both genes aggravated the defects in mice  <cit> . while six <dig> and six <dig> are also expressed in drg in the trunk  <cit> , the functional significance of the two genes in the development of drg neurons and rb cells has not been explored.

in the present study, we found that six <dig> is expressed in xenopus rb cells just before apoptotic cell death. experiments involving six <dig> overexpression and knockdown demonstrated that six <dig> is a key molecule for the ontogenic transition of rb cells to drg neurons during development. moreover, in mice, six <dig> and six <dig> were essential for the normal development of drg, and loss of both genes allowed the emergence of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells, as a result of immigration of nccs into the spinal cord. we also investigated the molecular basis of the differential onset of six <dig> expression in both xenopus and mouse. the results showed changes in the activity of a conserved enhancer. based on these results, we suggest that heterochronic shift in six <dig> expression contributes to phylogenetic transition in the architecture of sensory neurons.

RESULTS
six <dig> expression is turned on immediately before the onset of xenopus rohon-beard cell apoptosis
to investigate the functions of both six <dig> and six <dig> in the development of trunk sensory neurons, we first examined their expression patterns in xenopus embryos . rb cells are characterized by their large size and dorsal location in the spinal cord and their nuclei are positive for isl1/ <dig>  <cit> . no mrna or protein expression of six <dig> and six <dig> was observed in rb cells at stages  16/ <dig>  25/ <dig> and 33/ <dig> . however, six <dig> mrna and protein expression was recognized in rb cells at st.  <dig> . the majority of drg neurons  were positive for six <dig> from st.  <dig> to  <dig>  the number of rb cells started to decrease at around st.  <dig> due to apoptosis  <cit> . these findings indicate that six <dig> expression appears before apoptosis of rb cells, and persists during drg formation in xenopus development, although both are trunk sensory neurons.

six <dig> controls the transition from rohon-beard cells to dorsal root ganglia during xenopus development
the above findings suggested that six <dig> is a key regulator of apoptotic death of rb cells and the development of drg during the transition of sensory neurons in xenopus. to test this notion, we investigated the effects of six <dig> overexpression and knockdown . to avoid any disturbance of early embryonic development, especially placodal development and early neuronal differentiation  <cit> , we utilized a steroid hormone-inducible system  <cit> . we generated mrna encoding xenopus six <dig> fused to the glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain   and injected it into v <dig>  blastomeres at the 16-cell stage. during normal development, the blastomeres give rise to the dorsal spinal cord and ectoderm, including rb cells  <cit>  . six1-gr was then activated by adding dexamethasone  at st. 16/ <dig>  at the time when the majority of rb cells had already exited the cell cycle  <cit> . the embryos were analyzed at st. 25/ <dig> 

in all experiments, enhanced gfp  mrna was co-injected to trace the distribution and lineage of the injected cells. rb cells, which are positive for both isl1/ <dig> and tlx <dig>   <cit> , were effectively labeled with egfp in embryos injected with mrna encoding β-globin as a control . dex-treatment did not alter the distribution or number of rb cells, or the proportion of egfp-positive rb cells in embryos injected with β-globin mrna . the number of rb cells in embryos injected with six1-gr mrna decreased significantly to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells  after dex-treatment, compared with dex-untreated control  and with β-globin mrna-injected embryos . the fraction of egfp-positive rb cells was also reduced by dex-treatment . to determine whether the observed reduction in rb cells was due to apoptosis, which is known to occur later during normal development, we performed immunostaining for cleaved casp <dig> . no signal was detected in the egfp-positive cells within the dorsal spinal cords of embryos injected with six1-gr mrna and untreated, whereas the signal was clearly detected in dex-treated embryos at st. 25/ <dig> . these findings suggest that precocious expression of six <dig> accelerates the disappearance of rb cells, at least in part, through the induction of apoptosis.

surprisingly, at st. 33/ <dig>  isl1/2- and tlx3-double-positive cells were observed outside the spinal cord in the six1-gr-overexpressing and dex-treated embryos , but rarely in the control embryos . importantly, most of these cells were positive for egfp , suggesting cell-autonomous effect of six1-gr activation. although isl1/ <dig> and tlx <dig> are markers for both drg neurons and rb cells , the extramedullary and ventrolateral location of isl1/2- and tlx3-double-positive cells suggests that these sensory neuron-like cells are closely related to drg neurons . taken together, these findings suggest that overexpression of six <dig> promotes premature differentiation of extramedullary neurons in xenopus embryos.

to evaluate the effects of loss-of-function of six <dig> on the transition of trunk sensory neurons, small interfering rnas  were introduced into the dorsal spinal cord through electroporation . we generated three different sirnas for six <dig> . the knockdown efficacy of the mixture of six <dig> sirnas was verified in hek <dig> cell line . to avoid disturbance of early development by six <dig> sirnas, electroporation was performed on st. 34/ <dig> embryos, before the onset of cell death  <cit> . because the maximum number of rb cells appears at st.  <dig> and the number falls thereafter  <cit>  , counting of rb cells in the trunk region  was conducted at st. 45/ <dig> . the number of rb cells significantly increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells in the control embryos  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells in embryos electroporated with the six <dig> sirnas . to validate the specificity of the six <dig> sirnas, we performed a rescue experiment by employing six1-containing silent mutations in the sirna target sequences , which was resistant to our sirnas . co-electroporation of six <dig> sirnas with the mutated six <dig> mrna reversed the knockdown effect of sirnas  , confirming that the knockdown of six <dig> itself causes a delay in the reduction of the number of rb cells.

taken together, the above findings indicate that early expression of six <dig> leads to a decrease in the number of rb cells, while it promotes extramedullary sensory neurogenesis. additionally, knockdown of six <dig> leads to delay in the reduction of rb cell number. based on these results, it is conceivable that six <dig> is involved in purging rb cells and promoting the formation of drg during xenopus development.

six <dig> and six <dig> control the development of mouse dorsal root ganglia
we next examined the roles of six <dig> and six <dig> in the development of sensory neurons in the trunk of mice. immunofluorescence staining with specific six <dig> and six <dig> antibodies  <cit>   showed similar distribution patterns for six <dig> and six <dig> proteins in the drg at embryonic day   <dig>  . six <dig> was located in approximately 50% of the isl1/2-positive neurons , but not in sox10-positive undifferentiated nccs or glia . we described previously the generation of six <dig> and six <dig> knockout alleles that harbor egfp and lacz genes, respectively  <cit> . because heterozygous embryos harboring the two knockout alleles  did not exhibit obvious anomalies in drg development , we used them to examine six <dig> expression by monitoring green fluorescence. egfp-positive soma in six1/4
+/egfp
 embryos was mostly positive for isl1/ <dig> immunofluorescence , indicating activation of the six <dig> locus in the majority of isl1/2-positive neurons at some point during differentiation, because egfp protein can reside in cells for a longer period than six <dig> protein. these observations point to the potential role of six <dig> in differentiation of ncc into drg neurons.

the drg of double-knockout embryos  were smaller and flat mediolaterally compared to those of the wild type and six1/4
+/egfp
 at e <dig>  . in addition, isl1/2-positive neurons were dispersed and emigrated ventrally compared with those in six1/4
+/egfp
 . furthermore, isl1/2- and sox10-double-positive cells, which are reminiscent of immature nccs, were frequently observed , whereas such cells were rarely recognized in wild type and six1/4
+/egfp
 . finally, the lumbar drg was found to fuse later in the development of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 . considered together with the lack of significant developmental anomalies in drg in six <dig> and six <dig> single-knockout embryos  <cit> , these findings suggest mutually compensatory roles for six <dig> and six <dig> in the differentiation and migration of drg cells and gangliogenesis.

the axonal bundle at the dorsal root entry zone   <cit>  was also positive for egfp in six1/4
+/egfp
 at e <dig>  . this was owing to intracellular diffusion of the long-lasting egfp protein, indicating that the sensory afferents originated from six1-positive neurons in drg. surprisingly, egfp- and isl1/2-double-positive cells were noted inside the spinal cord near the drez of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 , whereas these cells were hardly observed in six1/4
+/egfp
 . the egfp- and isl1/2-double-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 also showed immunofluorescence signal for ntrk <dig>  , a marker of proprioceptive neurons of the drg  <cit> . by contrast, the ntrk <dig> signal was observed only in the axonal bundle of drez in the spinal cords of six1/4
+/egfp
 . these findings suggest the novel roles for six <dig> and six <dig> in the development of drg and preclusion of intramedullary sensory neurons.

six <dig> prevents the appearance of sensory neurons in mouse spinal cord
to define the properties of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
, we first assessed the projection of neurites. the retrograde tracer rhodamine-dextran was injected into a region outside the spinal cord in e <dig>  embryos and subsequently observed in egfp-positive soma in the spinal cords of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 . by contrast, the tracer was noted only in the sensory axon bundle at the drez of six1/4
+/egfp
 . these results indicate that these egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 extend their processes outside the spinal cord. in the thoracolumbar region of wild-type mouse spinal cord, only somatic motor neurons and preganglionic motor column cells with projections to the sympathetic ganglia send axons from the inside of the spinal cord to the outside, through the ventral root  <cit> . the atypical projection of the intramedullary egfp-positive cells of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos suggests resemblance to the intramedullary sensory neurons, rb cells, of anamniotes.

xenopus rb cells are tlx3-positive . the majority of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 were positive for tlx <dig> . the drg neurons and subsets of differentiated interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord were also tlx3-positive, as reported previously  <cit>  , however, these cells appeared normal in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 . the transcript of a shaker-like potassium channel kcna <dig>  was detected previously in xenopus rb cells  <cit> , and we confirmed the protein localization of kcna <dig> in rb cells by immunohistochemical analysis . in e <dig>  six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos, a subset of intramedullary egfp-positive cells was positive for kcna <dig> , although no such cells were observed in the dorsal spinal cord of six1/4
+/egfp
 embryos . runt-related transcription factors, runx <dig> and runx <dig>  are expressed in xenopus rb cells and runx <dig> is critical for the development of rb cells  <cit> . the majority of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 were positive for both proteins , although no such cells were recognized in six1/4
+/egfp
 spinal cord . rb cells are distributed in a non-segmental manner  <cit> , whereas drg show segmental and symmetrical organization along the body axis. the intramedullary egfp-positive cells of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 never showed any distinguishable segmental arrangements . considered together, these findings suggest that intramedullary egfp-positive cells have substantial common features with the amphibian rb cells.

the sensory neurons in drg originate from the ncc. next, we examined whether the egfp-positive cells in the spinal cord of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 originate from ncc by employing a genetic strategy to label ncc lineage. by crossing p0-cre mice, in which cre recombinase is expressed in tissues derived from nccs   <cit> , with a transgenic mouse line harboring cag-loxp-stop-loxp-mrfp <dig> cassette , the neural crest lineage can be visualized by the red fluorescence of monomeric rfp . virtually all egfp-positive intramedullary cells in the six1/4
egfp/egfp
;p0-cre;cag-lxl-mrfp <dig> embryos were labeled with mrfp <dig>  indicating that they originated from the neural crest .

in the mouse trunk, six <dig> and six <dig> are expressed in somites and the mesenchyme  <cit>  in addition to the drg. to determine whether the emergence of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos was caused by loss of functions of six <dig> and six <dig> in nccs, we restored the expression of six <dig> only in ncc derivatives. for this purpose, we generated a transgenic mouse line harboring cag-loxp-stop-loxp-six <dig> cassette  and crossed it with p0-cre mice. the number of egfp- and isl1/2-double-positive cells was markedly reduced in the spinal cords of six1/4
egfp/egfp
;p0-cre;cag-lxl-six <dig> embryos . the abnormal morphology and organization of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 drg were also rescued and the drg resembled those of six1/4
+/egfp
 . the number of egfp- and isl1/2-double-positive cells in the spinal cord at the level of somites  <dig> to  <dig> was significantly higher in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos , compared to six1/4
+/egfp
 embryos . ncc lineage-specific restoration of six <dig> expression markedly reduced the number of these cells to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells/embryo in six1/4
egfp/egfp
;p0-cre;cag-lxl-six <dig> mice . these results suggest that the cell-autonomous function of six <dig> in the ncc primarily suppresses the developmental program responsible for the generation of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells during mouse development.taken together, these findings highlight the importance of six <dig> and six <dig> in ncc-lineage in the formation of drg and preclusion of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells in mice .

medial migration of neural crest cells results in intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells
to determine the mechanism and source of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells, we examined their ontogeny. egfp-positive intramedullary cells were first observed at e <dig>  at the level of the thoracolumbar region in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos, and their number reached peak level at e <dig>  . the basal lamina marked with laminin-staining was often interrupted by the presence of egfp- and isl1/2-double-positive cells at the drez in e <dig> to  <dig>  six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos , although the gaps of basal lamina were normally occupied by axons originating from drg neurons in six1/4
+/egfp
 . time-lapse live imaging analysis of slice cultures of the e <dig> six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos at lumbar level indicated that egfp-positive cells migrated medially toward the spinal cord and finally into it . taken together with the results of labeling and rescue analysis using p0-cre , medial migration of nccs into the spinal cord seems a plausible mechanism for the emergence of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
.

lack of dorsal root entry zone disruption before emergence of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells
to explore the mechanism underlying the emergence of sensory neuron-like cells in the mouse spinal cord, we examined the boundary structure between the cns and peripheral nervous system  on the surface of the spinal cord.

boundary cap  cells are known to maintain the integrity of the boundary structure between the cns and pns. specifically, bc cells prevent the emigration of motor neurons at the ventral part of the spinal cord  and of glial cells to the periphery at the drez  <cit> . bc cells can be identified by the expression of egr <dig>   <cit> . egr2-positive nuclei did not overlap with egfp fluorescence in either six1/4
+/egfp
 or six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos at e <dig>  , and the distribution of egr2-positive cells located at the drez and mep was not apparently different between six1/4
+/egfp
 and six1/4
egfp/egfp
 . at e <dig> , no egr2-positive cells were observed at the drez , although they were observed in the cervical region  <cit> . egr2-positive cells were first detected at the level of the thoracolumbar region at e <dig>  after the appearance of intramedullary egfp-positive cells at e <dig> . at e <dig>  the numbers of egr2-positive cells at both the drez and mep were not different between six1/4
+/egfp
 and six1/4
egfp/egfp
. at e <dig> , the number of egr2-positive cells at the drez of six1/4
egfp/egfp
  was approximately half that of six1/4
+/egfp
 , although the number was similar in mep. these findings indicate that the emergence of intramedullary egfp-positive cells at the level of the thoracolumbar region precedes that of bc cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos. at e <dig> , when intramedullary egfp-positive cells were largest in number in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos, the number of bc cells at the drez of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 was smaller compared with that of six1/4
+/egfp
.

we also investigated the distribution of laminin, a major component of the basal lamina, to evaluate the integrity of the boundary structure between the cns and pns at the drez. gaps in the laminin layer usually mark the site of penetration of dorsal roots from drg neurons into the spinal cord   <cit> . in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos, intramedullary egfp-positive cells could originate from the cells that pass through the gaps and invade the spinal cord in the presence of possible disruption of the border. gaps in the immunofluorescence signal of laminin were observed in the drez of both six1/4
+/egfp
 and six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos . at e <dig> , the total length of laminin gaps in 50-μm length of basal lamina covering the drez was significantly greater in six1/4
egfp/egfp
  than six1/4
+/egfp
 . the difference was caused by the larger number of laminin gaps rather than longer individual gaps in the six1/4
egfp/egfp
 drez compared with six1/4
+/egfp
 . however, the total length of laminin gaps was comparable in the drez of six1/4
+/egfp
 and six1/4
egfp/egfp
 at earlier developmental stages of e <dig>  and e <dig>  at which intramedullary egfp-positive cells were already present. these findings suggest that the number of laminin gaps at the drez increased after the emergence of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos.

considered together, the above findings suggest no apparent change in the boundary structure at the drez before the emergence of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos, and that the number of bc cells decreased while that of laminin gaps increased after the emergence of intramedullary cells. thus, the emergence of sensory neuron-like cells in the spinal cord of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos could be due to translocation of nccs into the spinal cord, and the most probable mechanism for such translocation is a change in the intrinsic properties of nccs.

mouse six <dig> enhancer is activated earlier than xenopus enhancer in rohon-beard cells
the above findings demonstrated the role of six <dig> in the transition of trunk sensory system from rb cells to drg neurons in xenopus and in drg formation and preclusion of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells during mouse development. thus, six genes seem to be involved in the evolutionary disappearance of intramedullary sensory neurons, such as rb cells. in xenopus, six <dig> expression begins in rb cells preceding their apoptotic death during the transition from rb cells to drg . by comparison, the expression of six <dig> persists from the beginning of mouse drg development . the expression profiles of six <dig> in xenopus and mouse suggest that the onset of six <dig> expression during the entire developmental process of trunk sensory neurons could be different in these species, and that such difference could be the genetic basis of the disappearance of rb cells and exclusive development of drg. however, the developmental time scale is not the same in xenopus and mouse, because both species possess their own unique developmental processes acquired after the amphibian-amniotes divergence about  <dig> million years ago. therefore, it is difficult to directly compare the timing of onset of six <dig> expression between xenopus and mouse. accordingly, we focused on a conserved six <dig> enhancer  solely responsible for the expression of the gene in drg neurons  <cit> , and evaluated the timing of activation of mouse  and xenopus  enhancers under the same environment. we generated transgenic xenopus in which msix1- <dig> or xsix1- <dig> drives egfp expression to monitor enhancer activity in vivo <cit> . in the trunk of mouse embryos, msix1- <dig> activated the transcription in drg later than e <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, the enhancer activity of msix1- <dig> was observed in xenopus rb cells at st. 25/ <dig> , before the endogenous expression of six <dig>  and at st. 41/ <dig> . by contrast, the activity of xsix1- <dig> was observed only in a minor proportion of rb cells at st. 25/ <dig> , but became prominent at st. 41/ <dig> , just with the appearance of endogenous expression of six <dig> . both enhancers showed activity in drg at st.  <dig> . these results provide strong support to our notion that six <dig> expression appears earlier in trunk sensory neurons of mouse than xenopus . more importantly, the earlier expression is likely mediated by modification of a single enhancer that shares sequence similarity between xenopus and mouse.

discussion
in this study, we found that six <dig> is a key regulator of transition from intramedullary sensory neurons  to extramedullary sensory neurons  during xenopus development ; six <dig> precludes the appearance of intramedullary sensory neurons in mouse spinal cord by preventing nccs migrating into the medulla ; and the timing of six <dig> expression in sensory neurons could be altered by changing enhancer sequences .

previous studies have described the roles of six <dig> in proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the sensory systems  <cit> . the present study describes six <dig> as a key regulator of apoptosis during the process of disappearance of xenopus rb cells and assigning proper location of mouse sensory neurons. because cdk <dig> is involved both in apoptosis and positioning of rb cells in zebrafish  <cit> , the differential functions of six <dig> might be elaborated by such molecules. it is possible that the precocious disappearance of rb cells in six1-overexpressed xenopus embryos is caused by reasons other than apoptosis. defects in the medial migration are expected to reduce the number of rb cells incorporated in the dorsal spinal cord of xenopus, analogous to mouse development in which the medial migration of nccs leading to the emergence of intramedullary sensory neuron is precluded by six genes. identifying the mechanism of disappearance of rb cells might produce further evidence to understand the evolution of sensory neuron architecture.

surprisingly, sensory neuron-like cells appeared in the spinal cord of six1/4
egfp/egfp
, though it is unclear whether they are functional or not. what is the identity of such cells and what does their appearance imply? intramedullary egfp-positive cells disappeared by e <dig> , probably due to apoptotic cell death , which might be induced by inappropriate environment for survival. the disappearance does not allow us to characterize the functional features of such cells as sensory neurons. the sporadic presence of such cells has been reported in amniotes, including reptiles  <cit>  and human embryos  <cit> . intramedullary neurons in human embryos are considered to be homologous to rb cells, because they share anatomical characteristics with amphibian rb cells  <cit> . such cells are located in the region where dorsal root fibers enter the spinal cord in human, reminiscent of the position of emergence of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 mice. the facts that intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 express ntrk <dig>  tlx <dig>  kcna <dig>  runx <dig> and runx3; possess neurites leaving the spinal cord; and are distributed in a non-segmental manner indicate that they share certain properties with the rb cells. it has been proposed that nccs and rb cells evolutionarily share a common origin  <cit> . there are a couple of molecular evidences supporting this scenario: notch/delta signaling is involved in segregating the two fates  <cit> , prdm <dig> has a role to specify both  <cit> , and runx <dig> is required for the differentiation of both rb cells and subtype of drg neurons  <cit> . that intramedullary cells in mouse share some features with rb cells and are derived from nccs, similar to drg neurons, suggests common origin of intra- and extramedullary sensory neurons. despite the fact that both drg neurons and intramedullary egfp-positive cells are derived from nccs, they seem to follow segmental and non-segmental arrangement in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos, respectively. segmental arrangement of drg is determined by ncc-somite interactions  <cit> . intramedullary egfp-positive cells might be relieved from such signaling because they are physically isolated from the influence of somites by the basal lamina. one of the key components of ncc-somite interactions is neuropilin /semaphorin signaling. nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> are expressed in nccs and play essential roles in segmental formation of drg and segmental migration of nccs, respectively  <cit> . nrp <dig>  but not nrp <dig>  was expressed in intramedullary egfp-positive cells of six1/4
egfp/egfp
 , although the cells are derived from nccs. because genetic ablation of nrp <dig> results in disorganization of segmental migration of nccs  <cit> , non-segmental arrangement of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 might be due to the lack of nrp <dig> expression rather than the physical isolation mentioned above. interestingly, nrp <dig>  but not nrp <dig>  is also expressed inside xenopus spinal cord  <cit> , where rb cells exist, suggesting that the combined expression of nrps is a potential molecular basis for the non-segmental arrangement of intramedullary sensory neurons.

how do ectopic intramedullary sensory neurons appear in the six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos? our analysis demonstrated that the incorporation of migrating nccs into the spinal cord is the most plausible scenario for the presence of such cells. davidson and keller  <cit>  showed that frog dorsal neural tube is remodeled by medial migration and radial intercalation of lateral neural plate, including rb cells, which appear in the lateral edge of the neural plate before neural tube formation. in other words, already-specified rb cells segregate from the border and migrate medially to settle in the dorsal neural tube. a similar morphological event is observed in fish development  <cit> . the intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos show medial migration into the spinal cord from the outside. of course, one cannot completely exclude the involvement of other mechanisms in the emergence of intramedullary egfp-positive cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 in addition to the medial migration of nccs. abnormalities in the structure that separates the cns and pns at the drez could be one such mechanism involved in the process of migration of nccs into the spinal cord. we observed fewer bc cells and larger number of laminin gaps at the drez at e <dig>  in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 compared with six1/4
+/egfp
. however, the fact that intramedullary egfp-positive cells were already present at e <dig>  suggests that defects in the boundary structure is not the primary reason for the appearance of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells in six1/4
egfp/egfp
 embryos.

our data suggest that six <dig> is also involved in the evolution of extramedullary sensory neurons or the drg system. acquisition of new expression domains of six <dig> in the dorsal spinal cord or in the ncc lineage may have contributed to the establishment of the drg system. the mouse six <dig> enhancer for drg neurons exhibited earlier enhancer activity than xenopus six <dig> enhancer in rb cells and precocious overexpression of six <dig> caused premature differentiation of extramedullary neurons during xenopus development. this raises the possibility that the earlier expression of six <dig> in the dorsal neural tube, including rb cells and nccs, was acquired at some point during the evolution from anamniotes to amniotes. this hypothesis can be tested by analyzing the activities of the corresponding enhancers from various species including reptiles and birds.

moreover, the directive role of six <dig> in generating extramedullary sensory neurons may have deeper origins. in the amphioxus embryos, six1/ <dig> seems to be expressed in type i epidermal sensory cells outside the spinal cord  <cit> ; however, its expression has not been reported in retzius bipolar cells, which are probably homologous to rb cells. although there is controversy regarding the vertebrate cell type that is homologous to amphioxus extramedullary type i sensory cells  <cit> , the expression of six <dig> in extramedullary sensory neurons of both amphioxus and vertebrates is intriguing and suggests that six <dig> is being recruited as one of the key regulators for generating sensory neurons outside the spinal cord, despite the different evolutionary or developmental origins of the cells.

following the concept that altered expression of developmental regulators is an important step in morphological evolution  <cit> , evolutionary insights have been made from experimental results obtained through the manipulation of gene expression  <cit> . recent work has elegantly demonstrated that the acquisition of a novel enhancer results in a change in gene expression, yielding morphological diversity  <cit> . this suggests that the upstream mechanisms acting on the enhancer could be established prior to morphological changes. our findings suggest that changes in the enhancer sequence that caused heterochronic shift in six <dig> expression in the trunk sensory precursors of the amniote ancestors could be the genetic basis for the succession from intra- to extramedullary sensory neurons, including the disappearance of rb cells .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we used inter-species gene manipulations to show the critical role of six <dig> in switching of rb cells to drg neurons in frog and in the establishment of the exclusive drg system of mice, coupled with late or early onset of six <dig> expression during sensory development. gain- and loss-of-function of six <dig> was demonstrated by experimental changes in intra- versus extramedullary sensory neurons both in frogs and mice, suggesting the conserved function of six <dig> in both species despite the different sensory architectures. the species-specific activities of six <dig> enhancers, which correlate with the differential onset of six <dig> expression in the trunk sensory precursors, could be the genetic basis for the different sensory architecture in frogs and mice. our findings provide a specific example of how alterations in gene expression can contribute to substantial changes in morphology during evolution.
