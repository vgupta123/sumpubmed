BACKGROUND
the transition to flowering is arguably the most critical switch in a plant’s life cycle  <cit> . it is triggered by a combination of environmental cues and endogenous signals  <cit> . the appropriate timing of the transition is crucial for reproductive success, and hence is a major production issue for ornamental plant cultivators  <cit> . in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, floral transition is controlled by an intricate regulatory network comprising six distinct pathways, namely the photoperiod, the autonomous, the vernalization, the gibberellin , the ambient temperature and the age pathways  <cit> . the outputs of the various pathways are integrated by the products of the floral integrator genes flowering locus t  and suppressor of overexpression of constans , which promote flowering by inducing the expression of the floral meristem identity genes leafy  and apetala <dig> . the gene co  is a key component of the photoperiod pathway; it promotes flowering by up-regulating ft . the autonomous and vernalization pathways activate flowering by down-regulating the floral repressor gene flc, which encodes a mads-box transcription factor acting to repress the floral integrators  <cit> . an increase in ga synthesis promotes flowering, especially in plants experiencing short days ; early flowering results from the activation of soc <dig>  <cit> . under an otherwise non-inductive photoperiod, the flowering of a. thaliana is also accelerated by a rise in the ambient temperature  <cit> . as the plant ages, squamosa promoter binding like  transcription factors promote flowering by inducing the expression of the floral integrators lfy, fruitfull  and soc <dig>  <cit> . in addition to photoperiod and ambient temperature, flowering time can be affected by the content of trehalose-6-phosphate , acting through the sugar signaling pathway  <cit> .

chrysanthemum  is a popular ornamental plant worldwide  <cit> . most chinese commercial cultivars will only flower if exposed to sd, so achieving year-round production requires flowering to be induced by controlling the daylength, which is a costly and energy-consuming measure  <cit> . even with precise control over photoperiod, premature flowering can be induced by higher than optimal ambient temperature, which is often experienced during the summer months  <cit> . the japanese cultivar ‘yuuka’ flowers naturally over the period july-september, filling a gap in the chrysanthemum cut flower market, its flowering is accelerated under sd comparing with the natural conditions  <cit> .

some transcriptomic analysis relevant to flowering time regulation has been attempted in chrysanthemum and its close relatives. some features of the chrysanthemum transcriptome related to photoperiod-responsive floral development have been explored using cdna-aflp technique  <cit> . in the cultivar ‘fenditan’, a number of genes involved in the photoperiod pathway and flower organ determination have been identified using illumina sequencing technology  <cit> . meanwhile, an analysis of chrysanthemum lavandulifolium  succeeded in identifying  <dig> flowering-related genes, along with a large number of genes which were differentially transcribed between immature plants and those on the cusp of flowering. since the constitutive expression in c. morifolium of csftl <dig>  a ft-like gene harbored by chrysanthemum seticuspe, resulted in acceleration in flowering under non-inductive conditions, this gene has been considered to be an important regulator of the photoperiod flowering pathway  <cit> . the product of csaft, a gene encoding an anti-florigenic ft/tfl <dig> family protein, acts as a systemic floral inhibitor, determining flowering time under sd  <cit> . the suppression of cmbbx <dig>  causes plants to flower earlier than expected  <cit> . other than these few examples, the molecular basis of the response to photoperiod in summer-flowering chrysanthemums has not been deduced in any detail.

here, a comparison between the rna-seq acquired transcriptomes of ‘yuuka’ plants exposed to contrasting photoperiods was used to characterize the transcriptome associated with floral transition, with a view to clarifying the molecular basis of flowering time, which would be helpful to regulate flowering in chrysanthemum to achieve year-round production and the identified important regulatory genes will be useful for flowering-related transgenic breeding.

RESULTS

identification of tfs and other genes involved in flowering time control
according to unigene annotation,  <dig> of the sequences were identified as encoding a member of one of  <dig> tf families , among which the most frequently occurring were wrky, followed by g2-like, c3h and myb. with respect to genes involved in the determination of flowering time,  <dig> homologs of a. thaliana genes were uncovered . among those associated with the photoperiod pathway were three homologs of elf <dig> , one of elf <dig>  four of pif <dig>  three of fkf <dig>  six of lhy , six of prrs , one of cca <dig> ,  <dig> of gi and  <dig> of co. other flowering time pathways were also well represented, as for example homologs of ga20ox, emf <dig>  gai , gid <dig>  and spy in ga pathway, svp , fca, fve, fy, fpa and hos <dig> in ambient temperature pathway; ld in autonomous pathway; spls  and jmj <dig> in age pathway; flc , vin <dig>  and vin <dig> in vernalization pathway. a number of flowering integrators were also identified. the details of  <dig> homologs of flowering time genes were presented in .

the effect of photoperiod on the transcription of floral initiation genes
genes involved in the determination of photoperiod-induced flowering time in ‘yuuka’ were identified by initially calculating the transcript abundance of all unigenes of the above six libraries successively, based on the number of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads  method  <cit> . subsequently, each unigene of the five pairwise contrasts ck vs s <dig> , ck vs s <dig> , ck vs l <dig> , ck vs l <dig>  and ck vs l <dig>  was scanned for significant differential transcription, adopting a false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig>  and a |log2ratio| threshold of  <dig>  the resulting set of differentially transcribed genes  is given in additional file 4: table s <dig>  additional file 5: table s <dig>  additional file 6: table s <dig>  additional file 7: table s <dig>  additional file 8: table s <dig>  additional file 9: table s <dig>  additional file 10: table s <dig>  a greater number of genes were down-regulated in these contrasts than were up-regulated . more dtgs were identified in ck vs s <dig> than in ck vs l <dig>  indicating that the response to sd in terms of floral induction and development was more substantial than that to ld; a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes involved the photoperiod pathway with differential transcript abundance were also identified in contrasts l <dig> vs s1and l <dig> vs s <dig> . the details of the key dtgs identified are presented in tables  <dig>   <dig> and additional file 12: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> dtgs identified in pairwise comparisons between libraries



dtgs involved in the response to floral induction
many of the dtgs were associated with one of the photoperiod, ga, t6p or sugar signaling pathways . unigene11703_all, 38196_all and 29301_all, which are homologs of a. thaliana gi   <cit> , were all up-regulated under both ld and sd, while the abundance of a fourth gi homolog’s  transcript was increased only under ld. three co-like homologs  were up-regulated under both ld and sd, cl <dig>  contig5_all was only up-regulated under sd and cl <dig> contig1_all under ld, while two additional  were down-regulated under both photoperiods. the transcript abundance of one ga20ox homolog  was enhanced under both ld and sd. emf <dig>  and spy  were represented by, respectively, cl <dig> contig2_all and cl <dig> contig1_all; the transcript of both of these was less abundant under sd than in ck, while an emf <dig> homolog  was induced by ld. meanwhile, under ld, unigene28531_all, a phyb  homolog, along with a sucrose synthase homolog  and seven t6p synthase homologs  were all up-regulated. the implication was that the photoperiod and the ga pathways both represent the primary route by which flowering in ‘yuuka’ is controlled under sd, while under ld, it is the t6p and sucrose signaling pathways which accelerate flowering and the photoperiod pathway which blocks it. no dtg related to other known flowering pathways including ambient temperature, aging, autonomous and vernalization pathway was found. a proposed model for the regulation of floral induction in ‘yuuka’ was presented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> a proposed model for the regulation of floral induction in summer-flowering ‘yuuka’, taking into account the ambient photoperiod



the differential transcription of tf genes
most of the key regulatory genes involved in floral induction encode a tf. members of the bhlh, myb, c3h, bbx, mads, gata and wrky tf families were among the dtgs associated with floral induction in ‘yuuka’ . of the bhlh dtgs,  <dig> encoded phytochrome-interacting factors  proteins – two of which  were only up-regulated under sd, while ld induced three other members of this family  and repressed one ; the other  <dig> were all induced under both photoperiods. with respect to the bbx family, the transcript abundance of cl <dig> contig1_all was increased under ld, and both cl <dig> contig5_all and unigene11562_all showed increased transcript abundance only under sd. of the myb dtgs, three were down- and one was up-regulated by both photoperiod treatments; in four, transcript abundance was reduced under sd, and in another two, it was increased under ld. certain members of the mads family  were expressed during the early stages of floral induction, while other members  were expressed throughout floral induction and differentiation.

quantitative real time pcr  validation of differential transcription
to further verify the genes transcript profiles obtained from illumina rna-seq results, a selection of  <dig> dtgs for their key roles in flowering time control was used for validation by qrt-pcr: the chosen genes were homologs of flavinbinding, kelch repeat, f-box  <dig>  col <dig>  col <dig>  myb, gata, ga20ox, apetala  <dig> and agamous-like  <dig> . the outcome in each case was consistent with the rna-seq assay .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of eight dtgs selected from the rna-seq experiment.  s <dig> samples;  l <dig> samples;  s <dig> samples



discussion
the transcriptome of summer-flowering chrysanthemum
the output of the rna-seq-acquired transcriptome of ‘yuuka’ was a set of some  <dig> million clean reads, which covered about  <dig>  × 109 nt of sequence; the sequences resolved into > <dig>  unigenes, more than 60 % of which could be assigned a putative function. an equivalent transcriptome acquisition program in c. morifolium realized around  <dig>  unigenes sequences, of which only ~47 % could be assigned a putative functions  <cit> , while in c. lavandulifolium, nearly  <dig>  unigenes were assembled, about 53 % of which were annotated  <cit> . so far, the total number of dendranthema spp. unigene sequences deposited in the ncbi est database is a mere  <dig>  which means that the present data have provided a >1500 % increase in the representation of the transcriptome of this economically valuable ornamental species.

regulatory networks controlling the switch to reproductive growth in ‘yuuka’
though the differential transcripts represent both developmental as well as condition-dependent differences at the present could not be distinguished, those genes involved in the known flowering pathway and their othologs’ reported to function in flowering time, were further chosed to analyze in detail. based on the framework of floral induction established in a. thaliana, six regulatory pathways were implicated in the response of ‘yuuka’ to variation in the photoperiod. in many plants, the photoperiod is the single most important environmental cue affecting the flowering time  <cit> . the light receptors required for its sensing are the phytochromes  and cryptochromes , along with phototropin   <cit> . the transcriptome of ‘yuuka’ harbored homologs of phya, phyb, phyc, phye, cry <dig> and cry <dig>  but none related to phot. other genes related to the interaction of the photoperiod and flowering time were also among the dtgs, notably elfs, pifs, fkf <dig>  lhy, prrs, cca <dig>  gi and co. one ft homolog  was up-regulated under ld, but under sd the otholog of csftl <dig> was not, perhaps because ‘yuuka’ may be a quantitative rather than a qualitative sd plant. in c. lavandulifolium, genes related to the photoperiod, vernalization, ga and autonomous pathways have all been implicated in the determination of flowering time  <cit> , but this species flowers in the fall , so there are probably major differences in the floral switch mechanisms utilized by these members of the chrysanthemum family. in a. thaliana, the gene tps <dig>  is an important controller of the floral transition  <cit> . here, three tps <dig> homologs  were all up-regulated under ld, implying enhanced activity in the t6p signaling pathway. sucrose not only acts as a source of energy, but also has a role in signaling through its regulation of the spls . here, the transcript abundance of the unigene cl <dig> contig4_all, a homolog of a gene encoding sucrose synthase, was increased under ld. the conclusion was that both the t6p and sugar sensing/signalling pathways are likely important for the regulation of flowering in ‘yuuka’ under ld.

the regulatory networks underlying the control of flowering time depend on the photoperiod regime
the photoperiod which induces the switch to reproductive growth in summer-flowering chrysanthemum varieties is longer than that required by conventional varieties  <cit> . by analysing the transcriptome of ‘yuuka’ plants exposed to a contrasting photoperiods, it was possible to identify which genes responded to this major environmental cue. both under sd and ld conditions, a number of the dtgs were found to belong to the photoperiod pathway, some of which  responded in a photoperiod-specific manner. the gene co  was one of the first floral induction genes to be isolated in a. thaliana  <cit> , although in the meantime, additional members of the bbx family have been shown to influence flowering time as well , some positively and others negatively  <cit> . the rice homolog of bbx <dig> delays flowering under both ld and sd  <cit> . co is transcribed in a. thaliana plants grown under sd, but its product is not accumulated, thereby delaying the onset of flowering  <cit> . here, seven unigenes encoding bbx tfs were represented among the dtgs; their transcription profiling was quite diverse. the implication is that co-like proteins are likely to contribute in various ways to control the flowering time of ‘yuuka’.

the phytohormone ga acts as a growth regulator and an accelerator of flowering in a. thaliana  <cit> . particularly under sd, any disturbance to the ga pathway, or any reduction in tissue ga content delays flowering. the enzyme ga20ox catalyzes several steps in ga synthesis  <cit> . gid <dig> is known to be a receptor for ga, since the triple mutant gid1a/gid1c/gid1a is dwarfed and flowers late  <cit> . spy acts upstream of both gai and rga to negatively regulate the ga response  <cit> . here, a ga20ox homolog  was up-regulated in a photoperiod-independent manner, while a spy  homolog was down-regulated under sd. the implication was that both the photoperiod and ga pathways promote flowering under sd; meantime, under ld, the t6p and sugar signaling pathways promote flowering, while the photoperiod pathway gene phyb is up-regulated .

tf genes involved in floral induction
transcriptional regulation is an important component of plant growth and development  <cit> . in a. thaliana, a number of myb proteins are known to regulate the switch to reproductive growth. an increased abundance of myb <dig> in the phloem has been shown to accelerate flowering via its regulation of ft  <cit> . another myb protein  acts to repress ft transcription in the leaf vasculature  <cit> . the constitutive expression of cmmyb <dig> in a. thaliana induces a delay in flowering  <cit> . here, ten unigenes encoding myb proteins were represented among the set of dtgs. mads tfs are widely implicated in the control of flower development  <cit> . the a. thaliana gene svp encodes one such protein, which, during the plant’s vegetative phase, functions as a flowering repressor  <cit> . meanwhile, the constitutive expression in tobacco of a betula platyphylla ap <dig> homolog accelerates flowering  <cit> . agl <dig> and agl <dig>  along with svp and agl <dig>  are required to block the initiation of flowering in vegetative organs  <cit> . here, nine homologs of various mads tfs were represented among the dtgs. the implication is that in c. morifolium, as also in a number of other species, mads tfs are important controllers of floral induction.

in a. thaliana, the bhlh protein pif <dig> activates ft with the increase of temperature  <cit> . a number of pif proteins  are known to act as constitutive repressors of photomorphogenesis in the dark, and their proteolytic degradation is required to abolish the repression  <cit> . members of the tf families wrky, c3h and gata are also implicated in the machinery underlying floral induction . here,  <dig> wrky members were detected as dtgs. thus the members of the wrky family are likely to be important for floral induction in c. morifolium. with one exception, all the gata homologs were up-regulated, while  <dig> of the c3h homologs were down-regulated under both sd and ld. the different expression pattern of c3hs showed its different roles in floral induction. given that these tfs likely regulate floral induction  differentially depending on the photoperiod, characterization of the dtgs encoding tfs might shed light on the regulation of flowering time.

CONCLUSIONS
the present analysis of the ‘yuuka’ transcriptome has shown that under sd, flowering might be promoted largely though the activity of the photoperiod and ga pathways, while under ld, the t6p and sugar signaling pathways might promote flowering and phyb might block it. the dtgs identified here as being involved in the process of floral transition provide potential targets for the manipulation of flowering time in chrysanthemum, while their actual functions need to be fully elucidated in future.
