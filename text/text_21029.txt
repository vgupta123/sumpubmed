BACKGROUND
fusarium graminearum schwabe  petch) is the main causal agent of fusarium head blight  disease of small grain cereals and cob rot of maize  <cit> . mycotoxins produced by fusarium species result in a loss of yield and reduced quality of grains  <cit> . fusarium toxins including the trichothecenes nivalenol , deoxynivalenol  and its derivatives 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol  contaminate cereal products and have been shown to be harmful to humans, animals, and plants  <cit> . hence, the european union and the united states set limits for don in final products for human consumption of  <dig>  μg/g  no. 1881/2006] and of  <dig> μg/g . trichothecenes are potent phytotoxins for many plants. they can produce symptoms including wilting, chlorosis and necrosis at concentrations of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m  <cit> . the toxic effect of trichothecenes is mainly due to their ability to bind to the 60s ribosomal subunit of eukaryotes, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis  <cit> . don is a virulence factor in wheat  <cit> . don production enables the fungus to spread from infected florets into the wheat rachis  <cit> .

although detailed information of the tri gene cluster is currently available  <cit> , the factors inducing mycotoxin production during infection on wheat are unknown. the first step of the trichothecene biosynthesis is catalysed by the enzyme trichodiene synthase encoded by the tri <dig> gene  <cit> . thus, the tri <dig> gene is used as a marker gene for the induction of trichothecene biosynthesis of the fungus  <cit> . induction assays using axenic cultures revealed tri <dig> inducing conditions and substances under laboratory conditions  <cit> . however, little is known about tri <dig> inducing factors in planta. wheat infection of a fungal mutant with a tri <dig> promoter gfp  fusion revealed a tissue specific tri <dig> induction  <cit> . a high tri <dig> induction in the rachis node and in caryopses was observed. gfp and tri <dig> expression were much lower in the adjacent rachis and no gfp fluorescence was observed on anthers, although they were heavily colonised. one objective of the current study was to test different parts of the infected wheat spikelet for tissue specific infection patterns and tri <dig> induction. f. graminearum is one of the most intensively studied fungal plant pathogens  <cit> , but our knowledge about fungal development on host surfaces and the penetration strategy of the pathogen during initial infection stages is limited. thus, another objective of this study was to investigate fungal development and the penetration strategy of f. graminearum by different bioimaging techniques including bright field images, fluorescence microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy , and scanning electron microscopy . we performed an in vitro bioassay that allows a continuous microscopic evaluation of detached glumes, lemmas, paleas, and caryopses under comparable conditions. the in vitro bioassay was designed according to jansen et al.  <cit> , who performed a similar assay to investigate caryopses of wheat and barley infected with f. graminearum reporter strains. in addition, an in vitro bioassay using previously frozen, detached glumes for microscopic studies of initial infection of different f. graminearum mutants was recently published  <cit> . in the present study, monitoring of the infection process and tri <dig> induction in real time was possible by use of reporter strains. we achieved a continuous observation of fungal development in planta by constitutive expression of the dsred gene from discosoma spec.. the expression of gfp gene driven by the endogenous tri <dig> promoter in the reporter strain enabled monitoring of the trichothecene induction during infection in real time. previous studies demonstrated that tri5prom::gfp exhibits wild type-like growth and infectivity, tri <dig> expression and don production  <cit> . infection structures and tri <dig> induction were studied on different floret organs of wheat. in the field, fhb disease is initiated by airborne spores landing on flowering spikelets  <cit> . open florets during anthesis provide opportunities for the pathogen to contact primary penetration sites. developing caryopses as well as the adaxial surfaces of lemma and palea are only accessible in open florets and are comparably susceptible to infection  <cit> . f. graminearum initially colonises the surface of wheat florets without immediate penetration  <cit> . most fusarium species enter husks of wheat and barley by natural openings, such as stomata  <cit> , or penetrate epidermal cell walls with short infection hyphae  <cit> . f. graminearum is described as a pathogen that does not form different types of appressoria  <cit> . however, several recent publications provide light microscopy images of lobed, highly septate, and corralloid hyphal structures, which might be involved in penetration of glumes  <cit> . these authors distinguish between subcuticular coral-like hyphal mats and bulbous infection hyphae. the mitogen-activated protein kinase  mutants Δgpmk <dig>  <cit>  and Δmgv <dig>  <cit> , and also the gtpase Δras <dig> mutant  <cit> , were tested for their ability to form coral-like subcuticular structures and bulbous infection hyphae. while Δmgv <dig> and Δras <dig> mutants were able to form coralloid, subcuticular hyphae and bulbous invasive hyphae similar to those of the wild type strain ph- <dig>  the Δgpmk <dig> mutant formed coralloid subcuticular hyphae but no bulbous hyphae. thus, gpmk <dig> gene of f. graminearum was discussed to be involved in the formation of bulbous infection hyphae. additionally, first evidence was provided that papillae silica cells are preferred sites for invasion. we describe specific infection structures of f. graminearum wild type isolate 8/ <dig> and reporter strains with 8/ <dig> background. by combination of bioimaging and sem on floret tissues infected with a tri5prom::gfp strain and a trichothecene deficient Δtri5-gfp strain, the role of trichothecenes for different initial infection stages was evaluated. comprehensive imaging techniques together with molecular analyses might improve our knowledge about early plant-pathogen interactions during fhb infection.

RESULTS
screening of infection and tri <dig> induction in real time
we observed similar stages of infection on all tested floral organs infected with the wild type 8/ <dig> and the tri5prom::gfp strains using a mzfliii microscope. the process of infection could be divided into three stages . stage i: initial colonisation stage. within 6- <dig> h germination took place and the hyphal growth spread over the surface. hyphal growth was not notably directed to topographical features like longitudinal junctions between epidermal cells. short infection hyphae indicate direct penetration during stage i. however, no disease symptoms were apparent at this stage. homogenous hyphal networks were usually formed on caryopses until 1- <dig> days after inoculation, on paleas until 4- <dig> dpi and until 6- <dig> dpi on lemmas and glumes. from the respective time points onward hyphal morphology became heterogeneous. stage ii: main infection stage. during this stage runner hyphae began to branch at a high frequency and formed foot structures, lobate appressoria and infection cushions. figure  <dig> shows the typical stage ii of a wild type infection using light microscopy. removal of chlorophyll from husk tissues and trypan blue staining of hyphae revealed necrotic plant cells surrounding infection cushions . these lesions appeared at the earliest at  <dig> dpi on caryopses, at  <dig> dpi on paleas and at  <dig> dpi on glumes and lemmas. higher magnifications  revealed cytological similarities to described infection cushions of other fungal phytopathogens  <cit> . large infection cushions were formed by highly branched and agglomerated hyphae . additionally, smaller infection structures similar to lobate appressoria  and foot structures  were observed, as described for rhizoctonia solani  <cit> . trichothecenes are potent phytotoxins that can evoke symptoms like necrosis in a wide variety of plants at very low concentrations  <cit> . we considered that trichothecenes might be involved in the development of necrotic lesions on wheat tissues. therefore, we performed the in vitro bioassay with conidia of a tri5prom::gfp mutant. a specific tri <dig> induction was observed in infection cushions and not in the runner hyphae as identified by studies combining light microscopy using mzfliii microscope  and confocal laser scanning microscopy  . infection hyphae, lobate appressoria, and infection cushions showed an induction of gfp on all inoculated organs . furthermore, clms revealed direct penetration of epidermal cells through gfp inductive infection structures . interestingly, the gfp inductive structures were visible especially in papillae silica cells . epifluorescence microscopy revealed infection cushions increased in sizes during the following 1- <dig> days, while gfp induction decreased . disease symptoms such as brownish necrosis, as well as chlorosis develop rapidly in the ongoing infection stage. stage iii: final infection stage. the entire tissue of husks is necrotic, and aerial hyphae as well as sporodochia are produced. infection stages i-iii occurred likewise at the resistant wheat cultivar sumai  <dig>  and the susceptible cultivar nandu . therefore, formation of infection structures and gfp induction was not affected by the susceptibility or resistance of the cultivar. to test whether formation of compound appressoria and gfp induction was dependent on the inoculation method with detached floral organs, we examined floret organs of intact plants after spikelet point inoculation as a control. infection stages i-iii were observed on husks of the susceptible cultivar nandu and the semi-resistant cultivar amaretto within  <dig> dpi of investigation. conidia germinated within the first 6- <dig> hpi. between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi gfp inductive infection cushions developed on caryopses, paleas, and lemmas  demonstrating stage ii. from  <dig> dpi onward many aerial hyphae were formed and between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi tissues were entirely necrotic and chlorotic. in contrast to the other organs, glumes were not colonised within  <dig> dpi. no differences were observed between the wheat cultivars nandu and amaretto. investigations using spikelts on intact wheat plants  were repeated three times with both cultivars with similar results.

foot structures
lobate appressoria
observations were made at glumes, lemmas, paleas, and caryopses of the susceptible wheat cultivar nandu  and the resistant cultivar sumai  <dig>  infected with tri5prom::gfp mutant in detached in vitro bioassays.

sem of infection structures
ultrastructural characterisation of gfp inductive infection structures was performed by combination of fluorescence microscopy and sem. we identified gfp inductive infection cushions  , lobate appressoria  , and foot structures  . after removal of infection cushions from glumes, sem revealed numerous penetration pores of about 1- <dig> μm in diameter in the epidermal cell walls .

don quantification in wheat floret tissues
we measured the amount of don in glumes and caryopses using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for don detection to confirm that optical detection of gfp fluorescence of tri5prom::gfp reporter strain results in a detectable production of trichothecenes. the results revealed high don amounts in glumes and caryopses  . there is no detectable difference between the don amount in glumes and caryopses  considering the minimum detection limit of  <dig>  ppb for the used method to quantify don and the standard errors of the measurements of ±  <dig> ppb for glumes and ±  <dig> ppb for caryopses. the results demonstrate that the used tri5prom::gfp reporter strain produced high amounts of don after gfp fluorescence was visually detected during plant infection.

initial infection of a don deficient mutant
to evaluate the role of trichothecenes for initial penetration, we investigated infections using a trichothecene deficient tri <dig> knockout strain  with constitutive gfp expression. microscopic investigations revealed no differences between the early infection stages of Δtri5-gfp mutant , and the tri5prom::gfp reporter strain . necrotic lesions around infection cushions were observed by light microscopy using a mzfliii microscope . necrotic plant cells were visible after removal of chlorophyll by critical point drying . they refer to plant destruction at fungal penetration sites. sem of glumes infected by Δtri5-gfp mutant revealed that all types of infection structures including infection cushions , lobate appressoria , foot structures and infection hyphae  were formed by the Δtri5-gfp mutant. in summary, don production occurs specifically in infection structures, but is neither required for their formation nor for formation of necrotic lesions in their surroundings.

in the following , we summarise the presented experiments and microscopic methods.

discussion
infection stages and infection structures of f. graminearum on wheat
the colonisation of the inside of the wheat floret tissues by f. graminearum was evaluated in detail  <cit> , but information about fungal development on different wheat tissues and the penetration strategy of the fungus is limited. three successive infection stages  were distinguishable on all floret tissues.

we did not observe disease symptoms during stage i. this is consistent with previous findings that hyphae of f. graminearum initially branch symptomlessly on the exterior surfaces of floret tissues from wheat and barley, and do not penetrate the epidermis immediately after germination  <cit> . the disease symptoms of spelts and caryopses as well as sporodochia production described for stage iii confirm earlier descriptions of late infection stages of fhb on floret wheat tissues  <cit> . a very surprising result was the formation of compound appressoria during stage ii of infection. lobate appressoria and infection cushions are two types of so called compound appressoria  <cit> . they are described as multicellular types of appressoria, formed by irregularly shaped hyphae  <cit> . f. graminearum develops compound appressoria with striking morphological similarities to other fungal plant pathogens e.g. rhizoctonia solani  <cit> , botrytis cinerea  <cit> , and sclerotinia sclerotiorum  <cit> . previous publications provided the first microscopic evidences for more complex infection structures formed by f. graminearum  <cit> . two different structures were described, namely coral-like hyphal mats  <cit>  and bulbous infection hyphae  <cit> . coral-like hyphal structures were further specified by lobed, thickened, and branched hyphae  <cit> . we suggest that the coral-like hyphal mats are infection cushions, whereas the bulbous infection hyphae correlate to foot structures. however, coral-like infection structures were observed already at  <dig> hpi on glumes, while infection cushions appeared on glumes at  <dig> dpi in our assays. the difference might be explained by strain specific variations between the european wild type isolate fg 8/ <dig> we used, and the american strain ph <dig>  furthermore, the investigators studying ph <dig> used detached glumes, which were stored frozen before inoculation. in contrast to fresh detached glumes as used in our studies, the defence reactions of refrozen plant cells might be strongly reduced.

f. graminearum is commonly described to enter floret tissues of cereals by direct penetration via infection hyphae or by natural openings, such as stomata  <cit> . penetration through stomata by lobate appressoria and infection cushions was observed only occasionally during stage ii, but seems to be undirected. the earliest infection structures observed are infection hyphae. short infection hyphae are described in detail for different fusarium species by ultrastructural studies using tem and sem  <cit> . in our studies, infection hyphae were visible on all wheat organs during stage i and ii. we were not able to appraise the number of actually penetrating infection hyphae during stage i. thus, the impact of infection hyphae for further disease progression is not elucidated. interestingly, the tissues remained macroscopically asymptomatic until necrotic lesions surrounding infection cushions appeared during stage ii. necrotic lesions on cotton hypocotyls infected with r. solani appeared when infection cushions were fully developed  <cit> . this is consistent with our observations that lesions develop mainly around bigger infection cushions .

compound appressoria were formed on different types of tissues, like caryopses and spelts, but, depending on the type of organ, at different time points after inoculation . in summary, the results demonstrate that compound appressoria are formed independently of the biological function and morphological characteristics of different organs. they were formed on vegetative organs with silicified epidermal cells, but also on the pericarp of the caryopsis without silica cells. silicified epidermal cells seem to be a preferred site of penetration, but are not a prerequisite of successful infection. developing caryopses are highly susceptible for infection due to the absence for cell wall thickenings in the pericarp and underlying tissues. additionally, the results exclude a dependence of compound appressoria formation on certain topographical features, because the epidermal architecture of bracts and caryopses is fundamentally different. topographical features of the inoculated surface  <cit> , the availability of nutrients  <cit>  and plant exudates  <cit>  were discussed to be influencing factors for development and morphology of compound appressoria from r. solani. several abiotic factors which influence fungal growth and development, like humidity, temperature, exposure to light, and nutrient availability will probably influence the development of compound appressoria. for example, exposure to light has been shown to influence infection cushion formation of r. solani  <cit> . we propose that foot structures, lobate appressoria, and infection cushions mirror different developmental stages of infection cushion formation, similar to r. solani  <cit> . a schematic model that illustrates the development of infection cushions by r. solani is provided by armentrout and downer  <cit> . furthermore, a development of lobate appressoria into infection cushions is described for r. solani  <cit> , b. cinerea  <cit> , and s. sclerotiorum  <cit> . the increasing size and complexity of cellular structures observed during the time of infection supports the idea of a developmental process. it is currently unknown whether infection hyphae of f. graminearum, observed during stage i are involved in the development of compound appressoria.

in comparison to infection cushions, lobate appressoria are smaller and formed by fewer cells. they can be formed by a single lobate cell, but two-celled to multi-celled types are described as well  <cit> . in general, hyphae of lobate appressoria are short, swollen, and highly septate  <cit> . each lobe of a lobate appressorium can form an infection peg  <cit> . the development of compound appressoria from epiphytic mycelium is common for several other phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . direct penetration of epidermal cells by infection hyphae, infection cushions, and lobate appressoria was evident by clsm . the presence of penetration pores in the outer epidermal cell wall underneath infection cushions provides a hint for numerous penetration pegs. many penetration pores resulting from penetration pegs of infection cushions were demonstrated by comparable ultrastructural studies on s. sclerotiorum  <cit>  and r. solani  <cit> . the primary hyphae from which compound appressoria originate are termed runner or running hyphae in other infection cushion producing fungi such as r. solani  <cit> , several sclerotinia species  <cit>  and gaeumannomyces graminis, the causal agent of take-all patch disease  <cit> . the observed runner hyphae are clearly distinguishable from other functionally specified hyphae, e.g. hyphae that form infection structures, aerial hyphae or reproductive hyphae .

the early infection process of susceptible and resistant wheat cultivars  were indistinguishable. infection structure formation as well as don induction occurred comparably. this is consistent with the fact that type ii resistance of sumai  <dig> and amaretto may prevent systemic infection of the wheat spikes, but does not prevent initial infection of the inoculated wheat spikelet  <cit> . an artificial effect on compound appressoria formation due to the dissection of floral organs was ruled out by microscopic evaluation of inoculated spikelets from intact potted wheat plants. the investigation demonstrated infection cushion formation on the surface of paleas, lemmas, and caryopses . glumes were not colonised by hyphae and showed no infection cushions at  <dig> dpi. the difference in colonisation between glumes and adaxial surfaces of paleas, lemmas, and on caryopses might depend on the applied inoculation method. injecting conidia inside the wheat floret provides no initial contact of conidia to the glume surface. in bioassays using detached wheat tissues, infection cushions were formed later compared to tissues of intact plants. this might be explained by differences in humidity, light quality, and temperature differences. adding additional nutritions, i.e. sugars, to the detached flower leaf assays resulted in much shorter infection times. nevertheless, all different infection structures were formed at 2- <dig> dpi .

infection structures and don induction
previous infection studies with tri <dig> knockout mutants on wheat revealed that the trichothecene deficient mutant is still able to infect the inoculated wheat spikelet like wild type  <cit> . therefore, trichothecenes seem to be of minor importance for initial infection stages on wheat. in contrast, a major role of trichothecenes for the initial establishment in the host tissue was suggested  <cit> , because induction of tri <dig> expression was detected during early infection stages on barley spikes infected with f. graminearum  <cit>  as well as on seedlings of wheat infected with f. culmorum  <cit> . a tissue specific induction of the tri <dig> pathway during spike infections was indicated recently  <cit> . in the present study we demonstrated that tri <dig> expression is specifically induced in infection structures. the detection of high amounts of don in glumes and caryopses infected with tri5prom::gfp  confirmed that visible gfp fluorescence correlates to don production of the mutant. interestingly, infection structures and necrotic lesions are formed independently of trichothecene production. several explanations seem possible. firstly, the lesions surrounding the infection cushions are caused by the multiple penetration pores. these cellular destructions might induce host defence responses, similar to plant reactions by wounding . secondly, virulence factors, like an already described secreted lipase  <cit>  and most likely other not yet discovered factors, act independently of don, cause the observed destruction, and are responsible for the initial infection. the question remains why don is induced, even though it does not contribute to the virulence of the fungus at this time of infection. don is necessary to suppress plant defence enabling the pathogen to break through the rachis node. don production is strongly induced, most likely by the host, at this point of infection  <cit> . it seems possible that similar host factors induce don at other stages of infection, for example during the penetration of the cuticle. this might explain why a don deficient mutant colonises maize cobs similar to wild type, although the wild type produced high levels of don during the infection  <cit> .

different host compounds can be discussed to be responsible for tri <dig> induction during infection. nitrogen and carbon sources as well as low ph play key roles in regulation of mycotoxins produced by aspergillus species, such as sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin  <cit> . many nitrogen containing substances like various amines were identified that significantly induce tri <dig> expression  <cit> . the amine putrecine induced tri <dig> expression and mycotoxin production in vitro to levels observed during infection  <cit> . in addition, it was demonstrated that low extracellular ph is required for don production in axenic culture  <cit> . a combination of low ph and amines results in significantly enhanced expression of the tri <dig> gene and increased don production. the factors responsible for tri <dig> induction of infection structures in planta has to be evaluated in further investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
we provided here the first evidence that f. graminearum is able to form lobate appressoria and infection cushions during fhb infection. it is generally believed that fusarium species invade host tissues without generating an appressorium  <cit> . in the present study we demonstrated that the penetration strategy of f. graminearum on wheat florets is more complex than postulated until now. compound appressoria were formed on different types of tissues like caryopses and husks. therefore, a tissue independent formation of compound appressoria is demonstrated. a major role of cushion formation on symptom development is suggested by necrotic lesions and penetration pores underneath cushions. a specific induction of trichothecenes in infection structures was demonstrated by clsm. consequently, a relation between don production and direct penetration was investigated. interestingly, infections with a trichothecene deficient mutant revealed no differences compared to infections with trichothecene producing strains. trichothecene biosynthesis is specifically induced in infection structures, but not a prerequisite for their development and the initial penetration of wheat tissues. in summary, the combination of different bioimaging techniques with functional reporter strains and electron microscopy provided new insights into the penetration strategy of f. graminearum and the role of trichothecene induction during initial infection of wheat. a detailed knowledge about early development of fhb might help to explore new ways of disease control.
