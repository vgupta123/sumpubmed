BACKGROUND
allergic diseases represent a major health problem affecting a large sector of the population  <cit> . type i hypersensitivity, or allergy, is initiated by the recognition of an allergen by antigen presenting cells ), followed by a series of events that eventually result in ige antibody production, mast cell sensitisation and triggering  <cit> . allergen recognition by dcs represents the first step in allergic sensitisation and, therefore, is considered an attractive target for study since it might have an important role in determining subsequent downstream events of the allergic cascade  <cit> .

allergens, such as der p  <dig>  that cause these allergic reactions are generally innocuous proteins. der p  <dig> is considered as the most immunodominant allergen of the house dust mite dermatophagoides pteronyssinus <cit> . it is a 25 kda protein with cysteine protease activity. this protease activity is thought to be responsible for der p  <dig> being a potent inducer of ige synthesis, which is most probably mediated by the cleavage of regulatory molecules of ige synthesis, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule- <dig> -grabbing non-integrin   <cit> .

dcs are professional antigen-presenting cells that occupy a central position at the interface of innate immunity and adaptive immune responses, through recognising foreign antigens, processing them and presenting them to t cell receptors via mhc molecules  <cit> . dcs use multiple pathways and cell-surface molecules for antigen capture and receptor-mediated endocytosis  <cit>  which could influence t cell polarisation. 

in recent studies in our laboratory, it was shown that the c-type lectin receptors, mannose receptor  and dc-sign, play a significant role in der p  <dig> uptake, internalisation and presentation. it has been shown that these receptors are characterised by the presence of carbohydrate recognition domains  that recognise sugar moieties on allergens  <cit> . the other two receptors thought to be involved in allergen uptake by dcs are ige high and low affinity receptors, fcϵri and fcϵrii  respectively. however, their precise roles in capturing allergen by dcs and subsequent presentation to t cells are not fully understood.

it has been previously suggested that ige might play an important role in antigen uptake by dcs through ige receptors  <cit> . it was also reported that the competence of antigen uptake by langerhans cells increases significantly in the presence of ige and its receptor  <cit> . in this context, numerous studies by maurer and co-workers have emphasised the role of the high affinity ige receptor on dcs in the internalisation of ige-bound allergens and their presentation by the major histocompatibility complex  class ii compartment in a cathepsin s-dependent pathway  <cit> . the low affinity ige receptor expressed by b cells was also shown to participate in antigen presentation and activation of t cells in a mouse model  <cit> .

together, these findings helped to formulate the hypothesis of our work, which is that ige-mediated allergen presentation primes naïve t cells towards th <dig> cell differentiation. the elucidation of this mechanism could clearly have therapeutic potential.

previous work in our laboratory generated der p 1-specific chimeric human ige  and igg  antibodies consisting of mouse variable regions  joined to a human ige or igg <dig> constant regions, respectively  <cit> . it has been shown by using phage peptide libraries that the der p  <dig> epitope targeted by 2c <dig> antibodies is leu147-gln <dig>  <cit> , and this specificity is representative of a major component of the human ige response to der p  <dig>  <cit> . the availability of these two antibodies has therefore provided a unique opportunity to investigate the consequences of ige- versus igg-facilitated der p  <dig> presentation by dcs.

RESULTS
time course expression of fcϵri, fcϵrii , fcγri and mr by monocyte derived dcs 
the kinetics of expression of fcϵri, fcϵrii , fcγri and mannose receptor were studied during the course of generating mo-dcs, starting from day zero  through to days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

fcϵri was modestly expressed on monocytes at day zero, while fcϵrii and mr were less well expressed . on day two, fcϵri expression decreased, but levels recovered on days  <dig> and  <dig>  fcϵrii and mr expressions were at their maximum on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of culture . fcγri expression was high to start with  then levels diminished in the course of generating the dcs.

the specificity of ige binding by mo-dcs
immature dcs  were stained with ige-fitc, in the presence or absence of unlabelled ige or igg, in order to determine ige binding specificity. there was substantial inhibition of ige-fitc binding when mixed with unlabelled ige  but reduction in uptake in the presence of igg was not significant . in further experiments, immature dcs  were stained with ige-fitc, in the presence or absence of mannan, in order to exclude ige binding via the mannose receptor . der p  <dig> uptake with and without mannan was used to show that mannan was active in the experiment. as shown in figure  <dig>  whilst able to block der p  <dig> uptake, mannan had no effect on ige binding to dcs.

sodium periodate oxidation of natural der p  <dig> and the structural integrity of the deglycosylated allergen
der p  <dig> can be taken up efficiently by c-type lectin receptors  on dcs via its sugar residues. to study the influence of the uptake of der p  <dig> through immunoglobulins bound to dcs on t cell differentiation without mr engagement, we deglycosylated der p  <dig> to exclude binding through mr. to confirm the deglycosylation of der p  <dig>  western blotting of natural der p  <dig> and deglycosylated der p  <dig> against gna  was performed. unlike natural der p  <dig>  no band was visible with the deglycosylated der p  <dig> preparation . an elisa was used to ascertain the structural integrity of the deglycosylated der p  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  deglycosylated der p  <dig> was just as good as natural der p  <dig> in being recognised by the 2c <dig> and 5h <dig> antibodies

der p  <dig> reactivity of ige and igg 2c <dig> antibodies
an elisa was used to ascertain the der p  <dig> reactivity of the ige and igg 2c <dig> antibodies used in our experiments. results clearly indicate that the 2c <dig> antibodies react specifically with der p  <dig> and no such reactivity can be demonstrated with the control allergen  or the isotypes control antibodies .

ige receptors play an important role in der p  <dig> uptake by mo-dcs
to investigate the role of ige in the uptake of der p  <dig> by mo-dcs, we incubated cy <dig> labelled der p  <dig>  with and without ige 2c <dig>  with immature mo-dcs at 37°c. the experiment showed that adding ige 2c <dig> significantly increases der p  <dig> uptake to a level over and above that mediated by mr . the average means of uptake of der p 1-ige 2c <dig> is significantly higher than that of der p  <dig> alone , and der p 1-ige 2c <dig> when the cells were treated with mannan . when the cells were pre-treated with mannan, the means average of uptake of der p 1-ige 2c <dig> was significantly higher than that of der p  <dig> . in contrast, there was no noticeable difference between the uptake of der p  <dig> only  and der p 1-ige 2c <dig>  , which clearly demonstrates that the mr- and specific ige-mediated pathways make approximately equal contributions to der p  <dig> uptake by mo-dcs under these conditions.

fcϵri, fcϵrii , fcγri and mr expressions by myeloid dcs
myeloid dcs were stained with anti-fcϵriα pe, anti-cd <dig> pc <dig>  anti-cd <dig> ecd and anti-cd <dig>  fitc. as shown in figure  <dig>  fcϵriα was expressed on high proportion of myeloid dcs, whereas cd <dig> and mr expressions were lower. fcγri expression was detected on up to 43% of the myeloid dcs.

role of ige in inducing th1/th <dig> cytokine production in myeloid dc-t cell co-cultures
since myeloid  dcs showed high level of fcϵri and fcγri  expressions, with only minimal expressions of cd <dig> and mr, these cells provide an ideal opportunity to assess the role of ige and igg-facilitated allergen presentation in t cell polarisation with minimal or no interference by cd <dig> and mr.

myeloid dcs that had been loaded with natural or deglycosylated der p  <dig>  both with and without ige and igg 2c <dig> antibodies, were co-cultured with autologous naïve t cells. il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ secretions were then detected using a flowcytomix kit after stimulation with pma and ionomycin.

the data demonstrated a high level of th <dig> cytokine  secretion when the ige 2c <dig> antibody was used with either der p  <dig> or deglycosylated der p  <dig>  in comparison with using der p  <dig> or deglycosylated der p  <dig> alone . however, the results were only statistically significant for il- <dig>  but not il- <dig> or il- <dig>  ifn-γ production was high in all these conditions. as can be seen, deglycosylated der p  <dig> gave rise to more cytokine production in the presence of ige 2c <dig> than glycosylated der p  <dig>  this may have been due to deglycosylated der p <dig> being bound more efficiently by ige 2c <dig>  partial unmasking of the ige 2c <dig> epitope could occur upon removal of sugar residues if these sterically limiting access by ige 2c <dig>  in further experiments, the ige 2c <dig> antibody was compared to an isotype control  and again higher concentrations of il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines were detected with ige 2c <dig> . importantly, no such effect was demonstrable with the igg 2c <dig> antibody . collectively, these data show the selectivity of ige-facilitated der p  <dig> uptake by dcs in terms of bias towards a th <dig> phenotype. whilst t cells in these co-cultures are most likely sources of the detected cytokines, it worth highlighting that measuring cytokines in the supernatant does not allow exact identification of the cellular source of the cytokines.

discussion
it is well accepted that fcϵri is highly expressed on mast cells and basophils. however, a noticeable feature of fcϵri on apcs is that its expression is highly variable, depending on the blood donor and the pathological situation  <cit> . we initially sought to monitor the kinetics of the expression of the high and low affinity ige receptors , as well as the high affinity igg receptor , in relation to mr during the generation of dcs from day zero  to day  <dig>  and then finally day  <dig> . we successfully detected the expression of mr, fcϵri, fcϵrii and fcγri receptors on mo-dcs as a basis for exploring labelled-ige binding to mo-dcs. the present study demonstrated a modest percentage  of fcϵri expression and high expression of cd <dig>  and mr  on immature mo-dcs, in contrast to fcγri, which proved to be expressed in very low levels.

ige bound specifically to its receptors on immature mo-dcs, as its binding was inhibited by ige but not by igg. the optimisation of ige binding experiment revealed that the blocking effect of unlabelled ige was only demonstrable when added at the same time as labelled ige , and this could be due to the rapid turnover of fcϵriα on the cell membrane.

dcs express the c-type lectin receptors mr and dc-sign, which have the ability to recognise mannose containing-carbohydrates on different antigens and pathogens. mr has specificity for proteins with mannose, fucose and n-acetyl glucosamine, while dc-sign recognises high mannose oligosaccharide structures  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that ige is rich in mannose and n-acetyl glucosamine oligosaccharides  <cit> . this, therefore, raises the possibility of ige binding to dcs via c-type lectin receptors, particularly since previous studies have shown that ige can be taken up by human alveolar macrophages via mr  <cit> . however, our data have shown that ige binding by dcs is not mediated by c-type lectin receptors, as its binding was not inhibited by mannan, the natural ligand for mr and dc-sign.

the hypothesis that dcs could perform allergen capture and presentation via surface ige is of great interest, since this could lead to further perpetuation of allergic tissue damage in atopic individuals where ige circulates in very high concentrations. we were uniquely placed to test this hypothesis through the availability of ige and igg chimaeric human 2c <dig> antibodies directed against der p  <dig>  the major allergen of the hdm and an important cause of allergic asthma. this meant that we could study the role of ige in allergen uptake on dcs and compare it to igg, particularly since these antibodies have identical epitope specificity  and differ only in their constant region domains  <cit> .

having demonstrated ige binding to its receptors  on dcs, we proceeded to investigate the role of ige in der p  <dig> uptake using a flow cytometry approach, whereby dcs were loaded with labelled der p 1-ige 2c <dig> complexes. since der p  <dig> can be internalised by mr and dc-sign  <cit> , we used mannan, a polymer of mannose, to block mr and dc-sign in order to distinguish der p  <dig> binding via ige from that via c-type lectins. the results obtained show that der p  <dig> uptake by dcs increases in the presence of ige 2c <dig>  but not when human ige of irrelevant specificity was used as a control. mannan significantly inhibited der p  <dig> uptake by mo-dcs when dcs were loaded with der p  <dig> alone, but not when cells were loaded with der p 1-ige 2c <dig> complexes. this provides direct evidence that der p  <dig> uptake by mo-dcs is also mediated by a separate pathway  involving ige receptors.

the ultimate goal of this study was to explore the role of ige in allergen uptake and its presentation by dcs via ige receptors particularly fcϵri, and to compare this with igg. in line with previous studies  <cit> , we found that myeloid dcs have very low expression of cd <dig>  mr and dc-sign, but high expression of fcϵri and fcγri and are therefore ideally suited for our study. because mr and dc-sign internalise der p  <dig> via their carbohydrate binding specificity, we further used deglycosylated der p  <dig> to explore the role of ige in the uptake of der p  <dig> without interference from any residual c-type lectins. the deglycosylated der p  <dig> protein used reacted with the anti-der p  <dig> 5h <dig> antibody, as well as with 2c <dig> antibodies, thereby confirming its structural integrity.

it is well understood that the activation of cd4+ t cells leads their differentiation towards one of few developmental pathways such as th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> or treg depending on the concentration of different cytokines in the microenvironment amongst other factors  <cit> . th <dig> cells and their cytokines  are abundant in allergic disease, and these cytokines play a central role in initiating allergic inflammation. thus, we investigated the effect of ige and igg-facilitated der p  <dig> uptake by peripheral blood myeloid dcs on downstream events at the t cell level.

the co-culture experiments showed that ige facilitated der p  <dig> uptake by myeloid dcs supported the differentiation of naïve t cells towards a th <dig> cell phenotype. given the low expression of cd <dig> on myeloid dcs this effect is most likely mediated via fcϵri however we cannot rule out possible up-regulation of cd <dig> after sensitisation with ige antibody hence a contribution from cd <dig> remains a possibility. the th <dig> bias was evidenced by high levels of th <dig> cytokine secretion, particularly il- <dig>  when the ige 2c <dig> antibody was used in combination with natural der p  <dig> or deglycosylated der p  <dig>  however, these findings did not reach statistical significance with two  of the three th <dig> cytokines tested most likely due to the low number of donors and wide inter donor variations obtained. previous analysis of  <dig> crystal structures of known allergens  has shown that dimerisation is a very common and essential feature of allergens  <cit> . we can therefore reasonably assume that although we were using a monoclonal ige antibody , which will not permit cross-linking by der p  <dig> monomers, the biological effects observed in our dc-bound ige/der p  <dig> uptake experiments were due to ige cross linking by der p  <dig> dimers. however, given the importance of polyvalent cross-linking in efficient internalisation of fcϵri-bound ige  <cit>  it is reasonable to expect that using a polyclonal anti der p  <dig> ige antibody could further enhance the observed biological effects such as th <dig> cell polarisation. interestingly, and as expected, we were unable to show a similar bias towards th <dig> differentiation when using the igg 2c <dig> antibody.

our results are in keeping with a recent study by sallmann and co-workers using a new transgenic mouse model, which suggested that fcϵri expressed by dcs does indeed play a role in antigen uptake and the development of th <dig> allergic tissue inflammation  <cit> .

in conclusion, ige could play an important role in der p  <dig> uptake and processing by peripheral blood myeloid dcs and in the th <dig> polarisation of t cells. this would clearly serve to perpetuate symptoms of allergy in atopic patients where ige is already produced in large quantities. it is known that dcs prime th <dig> cell polarisation after encountering allergens, but the particular mechanism by which dcs induce th <dig>  instead of th <dig>  development is not fully understood. the present work provides a potential mechanism by which myeloid dcs may support the development of th <dig> responses and suggests a novel target for therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
whist c-type lectins play a key role in recognition and uptake of glyco-allergens including der p  <dig>  this study shows that ige bound to its high affinity receptor plays an important role in the uptake and processing of der p  <dig> by peripheral blood dcs as well as in th <dig> polarisation of t cells. such ige mediated pathway of allergens uptake could be particularly important in individuals with high serum ige levels who have already been sensitised to an allergen.
