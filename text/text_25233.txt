BACKGROUND
laticifer cells of plants are unique in shape, development and function. these cells form long tubular or branched structures that run through the plant body, and large amounts of cytoplasm are exuded when the plant body is cut. the cytoplasm is a sticky white fluid called latex, and in the case of the para rubber tree  and rubber fig , insoluble latex particles are a well-known commercial source of natural rubber  <cit> . laticifers are not present in all plant species. for example, well-studied model plants such as arabidopsis, rice, wheat, and tobacco, do not have laticifers. however, they have been reported in about  <dig>  <dig> plant species in  <dig> families, including monocots and dicots, and are estimated to exist in up to  <dig>  <dig> species in  <dig> families  <cit> .

one important feature of laticifers is that they contain various toxic compounds in the latex; for example, the neurotransmitter dopamine in the persian poppy , narcotic alkaloid morphine in the opium poppy , and insecticidal compounds such as the glycosidase inhibitors  <dig> -dideoxy- <dig> -imino-d-arabinitol  and 1-deoxynojirimycin  in mulberry  <cit> . in addition, cysteine protease in latex of papaya  and wild fig  is toxic to caterpillars of herbivorous insects  <cit> . the compounds are often highly condensed in the latex; for example, d-ab <dig>  dnj and its related compound  <dig> -dideoxy- <dig> -imino-d-ribitol are present at 8-18% dry weight in latex of mulberry leaf;  <dig> times higher than that in the whole leaf  <cit> . rubber is also toxic to herbivorous insects because its stickiness limits movement of their mouthparts  <cit> .

these findings suggest that laticifers are specialized cells that have a role in defending plants against herbivorous insects. the distribution of laticifers is associated with vascular tissue, which transports metabolites, water, minerals and signaling molecules through the plant body, and is one of the most important plant tissues. laticifers might protect the vascular system. long tubular or branched network structures are effective in this role, because they enable laticifers to exude large amounts of latex at damaged sites. in the present study, we speculate that proteins that are abundant in latex have a defensive role against herbivorous insects. here, we report that two proteins that are abundant in the soluble fraction of mulberry latex have insecticidal activities against the model insect drosophila melanogaster, possibly through their chitinase activity.

RESULTS
purification of la-a and la-b
sds-page analysis indicated that two proteins with a molecular mass of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda were abundant in the soluble protein fraction of latex obtained from the cut petiole  of mulberry. similar sds-page results were observed for latex samples taken from a young branch  of mulberry . latex is thought to have a crucial role in defense against herbivorous insects, therefore, the two abundant proteins were expected to have insecticidal activity. we named the proteins latex abundant protein a  and latex abundant protein b , and purified them to analyze their properties. cation-exchange chromatography , followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography   gave a single band of la-a in sds-page . la-b was purified further by cation-exchange chromatography   to give a single band . from  <dig> ml of latex, we obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg of purified la-a and la-b, respectively.

amino acid sequence analysis
a polyclonal antibody raised against la-a also recognized la-b , which suggests that they share sequence similarity. edman degradation showed that n-terminal sequences of la-a and la-b were similar to residues 22- <dig> of latex protein mlx <dig> of mulberry  <cit>  . the calculated molecular mass of mlx <dig> from residue  <dig>  to the c terminus is  <dig>  kda. mlx <dig> has two chitin-binding domains in the n-terminal half and a plant chitinase domain in the c-terminal half. it was thus suggested that la-a and la-b have chitinase domains. the n-terminal sequences of la-a and la-b were also similar to that of a latex protein from another moraceae plant, ficus benjamina  <cit>  and to the chitin-binding domains, located in the n-terminal end, of plant pathogenesis-related  proteins group  <dig>  and  <dig> . the molecular masses of pr- <dig> and pr- <dig>  are much lower than those of la-a and la-b.

analysis of glycosylation
la-a and la-b proteins were stained by pro-q emerald  <dig> , which stains glycoproteins, and indicates that they are glycosylated. to study the glycosylation of la-a and la-b in detail, we tested  <dig> lectins . of these, rca <dig>  which is specific for galactose, reacted strongly and reproducibly with la-a and la-b . this is a unique feature because common chitinases of plants are not glycosylated.

analysis of chitinase and chitosanase activities
the sequence similarity between the chitin-binding domains of known chitinases and the n-terminal sequences of la-a and la-b suggests that they are also chitinases. we therefore examined the enzyme activities of la-a and la-b. when using carboxymethylated  chitin labeled with remazol brilliant violet  as a substrate, la-a and la-b showed chitinase activity . when activity was tested at a ph range of 5- <dig>  maximum activity was observed at ph  <dig>  we could not test the activity at lower ph because the substrate was precipitated under these conditions. mayer et al.  <cit>  have compared cm-chitin-rbv-degrading activity of  <dig> chitinase isoforms of orange  with that of hen egg lysozyme. in that study, the activity of  <dig> isoforms was  <dig> times higher than that of hen egg lysozyme, and the activity of  <dig> isoforms was  <dig> - <dig> times higher. we also compared the activity of la-a and la-b with that of hen egg lysozyme. at ph  <dig>  chitinase activity of la-a and la-b was 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig>  respectively, of that of hen egg lysozyme at ph  <dig> . compared to the orange chitinases, la-a and la-b thus had markedly lower chitinase activity.

la-a and la-b also were able to hydrolyze chitosan, which is partly deacetylated and therefore solubilized chitin. chitosanase activity was tested at a ph range of 3- <dig>  and maximum activity was observed at ph  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  the chitosanase activity of la-a and la-b was  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher, respectively, than that of hen egg lysozyme . in the report by mayer et al.  <cit> , chitosanase activity of  <dig> chitinase isoforms was  <dig> and  <dig> times higher than that of hen egg lysozyme, and the activity of  <dig> isoforms was  <dig> - <dig>  times higher. one isoform showed no chitosanase activity.

these results indicated that la-a and la-b had chitinase and chitosanase activities, although the activities were relatively low compared to those of orange chitinases.

insecticidal activity against larvae of d. melanogaster
finally, we examined insecticidal activity of la-a and la-b using larvae of the model insect d. melanogaster. d. melanogaster has some advantages over other insects; it is easy to rear, and its small size and short life cycle reduces food requirements for the assay. in addition, because d. melanogaster does not eat mulberry, it was not expected to have any existing mechanism for overcoming the potential toxicity of mulberry protein. when 2-day-old larvae  were fed an artificial diet that contained  <dig> %  la-a or la-b, very few developed into pupae over  <dig> days of incubation . after  <dig> days, 80% of larvae fed with la-a and 40% of those fed with la-b were found to be dead . in contrast, when fed with diets that contained bovine serum albumin or no protein instead of la-a or la-b, almost all larvae developed into pupae . this result indicated that la-a and la-b had insecticidal activity against larvae of d. melanogaster.

discussion
in this study, we showed that the two proteins la-a and la-b were abundant in the soluble fraction of mulberry latex, and had low, but significant chitinase and chitosanase activities. in addition, both la proteins showed insecticidal activity against larvae of d. melanogaster. the finding that these major proteins have insecticidal activity supports the idea that laticifers are specialized cells for defense against herbivorous insects.

in a recently published study  <cit>  on mulberry latex protein mlx <dig>  it has been shown that mlx <dig> is glycosylated and has growth-inhibiting  activity on the lepidopteran caterpillars of cabbage armyworm  and eri silkworm , but not on mulberry specialist silkworm . similarities between la-a and la-b proteins and mlx <dig>  with respect to n-terminal amino acid sequence and electrophoretic mobility in sds-page, suggest that they are the same or similar proteins. however, contrary to our results, mlx <dig> has been reported to have no chitinase activity  <cit> . enzyme activity of mlx <dig> may need to be analyzed using various substrates. in our study, we observed chitinase activity of la-a and la-b when using cm-chitin-rbv and chitosanase activity when using chitosan , but the activity was hardly detectable when 4-methylumberryferyl Î²-d-n, n', n"-triacetylchitotriose 3), a common substrate for plant chitinase assay, was used . substrate specificity of la proteins and mlx <dig> could be different from that of common plant chitinases.

chitin, a substrate of chitinase, forms the cuticle of the exoskeleton in insects, and should be the target of la-a and la-b in the larvae of d. melanogaster and other insects. in addition to external body surfaces, the inside of the mouthpart is also a possible target of la-a and la-b because the ph inside the mouthpart is expected to be near that of crude extract of mulberry tissues  and to be optimal for the chitinase activity of la proteins.

plant chitinase is well known to have antifungal activity, but only a few studies have investigated its toxicity to insects. it has been reported that transgenic tomato that accumulated poplar  chitinase inhibited development of colorado potato beetle  larvae, and the amount of chitinase in the leaves was > <dig> %   <cit> . two papers have reported that insect chitinase showed toxicity to insects; chitinase of tobacco hornworm  included at 2% in an artificial diet showed 100% mortality of larvae of merchant grain beetles   <cit> , and transgenic tobacco leaves that accumulated chitinase of tobacco hornworm at  <dig> - <dig> % of total leaf protein inhibited growth of tobacco budworm  larvae  <cit> .

the insecticidal activity of la proteins might not be caused simply by chitinase activity. it could be that a domain of la proteins with unidentified biochemical activity cooperates with the chitinase domain to enhance insecticidal activity. estimated molecular masses of la-a and la-b  were higher than those of common plant chitinases . this is at least partly caused by glycosylation, but it also suggests that the proteins might have another functional domain and biochemical function, working in cooperation with chitinase activity for efficient toxicity. further analysis is needed to understand the molecular mechanism of insecticidal activity of la-a and la-b.

unlike some other insects that eat leaves of latex-producing plants, silkworm eats mulberry leaves without removing the latex by cutting or trenching veins . therefore, silkworms probably have a mechanism for detoxifying the insecticidal activity of la proteins, and are unsuitable for studying potential insecticidal activity of la proteins. one of the reasons why we used d. melanogaster in this study is that this insect does not eat mulberry and thus is not expected to overcome potential toxicity of la proteins. it would be interesting to know to which species of insect other than d. melanogaster  the la proteins are toxic. some insect species including silkworm would be tolerant to la proteins, and it would be interesting to investigate the mechanism by which they can overcome the toxicity of the la proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we indicated that two chitinase-like proteins  were abundantly accumulated in latex of mulberry and suggested that they have a crucial role in defense against herbivorous insects, possibly by hydrolyzing their chitin.
