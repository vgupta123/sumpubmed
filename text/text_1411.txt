BACKGROUND
recbcd is the key enzyme of double strand  breaks repair and recombination in escherichia coli <cit> . recbcd enzyme is a large heterotrimer  comprising recb, recc and recd polypeptides  <cit> , and has dsdna and single strand dna exonuclease, ssdna endonuclease, helicase, dna-dependent atpase and reca loading activities  <cit> . this multifunctionality enables the enzyme to initiate homologous recombination. recbcd carries out the presynaptic step of recombination to produce a 3' single-strand overhang. the e. coli hotspot chi  stimulates recombination near to and distant from its 3' end, so it facilitates the enzyme's task  <cit> .

genetic and physical assays show that recombinational dna repair in e. coli occurs as follows: if there is a ds break in the chromosome, recbcd specifically binds to the blunt or near-blunt dsdna ends  <cit> . unlike other helicases, recbcd has two independent helicase subunits, recb and recd, so the enzyme is a processive helicase  and begins to unwind the dsdna  <cit> . initially the enzyme degrades from the 3'-ended strand until it reaches the chi sequence in excess mg+ <dig> ions. thereafter, it degrades the complementary strand as unwinding continues  <cit> . the combined helicase and nuclease effects produce a 3' overhang  <cit> . recbcd loads the strand-exchange protein, reca, on to this 3' overhang to form a reca-ssdna filament. this filament catalyzes the formation of a d-loop with a homologous dsdna, which develops a holliday junction structure. postsynaptic resolution produces recombinants  <cit> .

a key aspect of this process is the interaction between chi and recbcd, which regulates the structure and activities of the enzyme. chi is a recombinational hotspot in the recbcd pathway and stimulates recombination up to 30-fold  <cit> . during unwinding, this octameric sequence is recognized by the recc subunit of the enzyme  <cit> , if recbcd only approaches from the right side  <cit> , and chi and enzyme then interact  <cit> . the enzyme continues to unwind after chi, though more slowly  <cit> , and at the end of the dna the subunits disassemble to form an inactive enzyme  <cit> . during the continued unwinding, the nuclease activity of the enzyme degrades the 5'-end strand  <cit> , and the enzyme begins to load reca on to the 3'-end strand to the left of chi  <cit> . the mechanisms of this regulation are not yet well understood, but it has been suggested that recd plays a role  <cit> . on the basis of similarities between the features of recbcd lacking recd and recbcd interacting with chi, the following hypothesis has been proposed: recd is ejected at chi to form a recombinogenic enzyme  <cit> . however, subsequent studies have shown that purified recbc is different from the enzyme interacting with chi: recbc lacks exonuclease and chi recognition activities, but can load reca constitutively  <cit> . recent single-molecule studies have indicated that recd remains associated with the recbc subunits at the chi site  <cit> . on the other hand, recd inhibits reca loading activity before the chi site; a point mutation in the reca loading domain of recb eliminates reca loading activity, but removing recd from these mutants reverses this inactivation  <cit> . against the hypothesis that recd is eliminated at the chi site, we propose that recd is required to regulate reca loading activity. to test this proposal, we generated two recb-recd genetic fusions that would allow us to examine the regulatory functions of recd. we tested four predictions:  <cit>  the fusion enzymes cannot bind specifically to dsdna ends and lack all enzyme activities;  <cit>  the fusion enzymes can bind to the ends but cannot unwind the dsdna;  <cit>  the fusion enzymes can bind and unwind dsdna, but lack nuclease and chi genetic activities;  <cit>  the fusion enzymes behave like wild type.

in this study we describe the recb-recd fusion mutants that have wild type phenotypes. both fusion enzymes are recombination proficient, can repair dna damage, and have dna unwinding, exonuclease and chi genetic activities. however, the fusion between recd and recb reduced the heterotrimer level. our findings suggest that recb-recd fusion may form recbd, a fusion protein, and may therefore affect assembly, but this effect does not change the three-dimensional structure of the heterotrimer.

RESULTS
recb-recd fusions were generated by recombineering
recbcd is composed of the products of recb, recc and recd, which lie between the arga and thya intergenic regions of e. coli . ptr, which encodes protease iii, is located between recc and recb. the recb termination codon overlaps the initiation codon of the downstream recd by one nucleotide. therefore, recb and recd form an operon with a major external promoter for both genes and with a minor internal promoter for recd. the major promoter to the left of recb directs the transcription of the  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides of the recb and recd coding sequences, respectively, whereas the weaker promoter to the left of recd appears to direct the transcription of recd alone. to generate a genetic fusion between recb and recd, the mutations were targeted to this overlap site. two fusion forms were generated:  <cit>  a deletion fusion mutation and  <cit>  a substitution fusion mutation. for the former, two nucleotides  of the recb termination codon at the overlap site were deleted; this removes the termination codon of recb but does not yield a frameshift mutation. for the latter, three codons encoding two asparagine and one glycine residues, which has the potential of forming equivalent hydrogen bonds and facilitates a beta turn respectively, were substituted at the same site. this substitution leads to a short bridge between recb and recd.

recombineering is the name given to the method that produces recombinants by the red-recombination function of lambda phage. short linear homologous dna strands  are required. recombination can occur between single-stranded or double-stranded dnas  <cit>  by the exo, beta and gamma proteins of lambda. single-strand pairing is formed between a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a mutation and single-stranded chromosomal dna arising from replication fork. this requires beta, an annealing protein, and a 35-nucleotide flanking homology on each end. to increase the frequency of recombination, the oligonucleotide should correspond to the lagging strand at the replication fork and the direction of replication should be counter-clockwise  <cit> . in this study, the deletion and substitution fusion mutations were generated by single-strand pairing. appropriate oligonucleotides were created and synthesized, then transformed into an e. coli strain containing lambda prophage . chromosomal dnas isolated from the transformed cells were then amplified with appropriate primers. six candidates with dnas expected to encode recbd fusion proteins were found for both mutants by colony-screening, and two were isolated by transduction . they were named v <dig> and v <dig> 

haploid alleles of recb-recd fusion mutants have wild type phenotype
purified transductants were subjected to the phage spot test on lb plate with λ red-gam-χ+, λ red-gam-χ <dig>  λ red+gam+, t <dig>  t <dig> gene 2- p <dig> and p <dig> phages . the sizes of plaques were evaluated  <cit>  :  <cit>  λ red-gam-χ <dig> formed small plaques, λ red-gam-χ+ formed medium plaques, and λ red+gam+ formed large plaques. in recbcd+ cells, λ red-gam-χ <dig> forms small plaques and λ red-gam-χ+forms large ones, whereas in recbc mutants, χ <dig> and χ+ phages forms plaques of the same size. our result indicates that v <dig> and v <dig> have recombination-proficient phenotypes.  <cit>  there were many plaques in the p <dig> spot. p <dig> lysogeny requires recbcd recombination function, so fusion mutants are recombination-proficient  <cit> . λ red-gam-χ+produced larger plaques than λ red-gam-χ0; this result suggests that there is a chi hotspot activity.  <cit>  t <dig> formed plaques, but t <dig> lacking gene  <dig> protein did not. gene  <dig> protein protects t <dig> dna ends from recbcd exonuclease degradation. in the absence of gene  <dig>  t <dig> cannot form plaques. this result indicates that the recb-recd fusion mutants have exonuclease activity.  <cit>  many plaques were found in the p <dig> spot. p <dig> phage growth requires the exonuclease activity of recbcd. our result suggests that fusion mutants have exonuclease activity.

recb-recd fusion mutants are recombination-proficient
the recombination proficiency of haploid alleles in the recb-recd fusion mutants was measured in lambda vegetative crosses  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the proficiency of recombination by each mutant with recbcd+, recb null mutant and the recd mutant. both the deletion and substitution fusion mutants gave high recombination proficiencies, similar to that of recbcd+ cells. recb null mutants were found to be recombination-deficient and recd mutants were recombination-proficient, as expected.

recb-recd fusion mutants have chi activity
chi activity was measured in hotspot crosses to determine whether the fusion mutants interact with chi  <cit>  . the ratio of frequency of recombination in a genetic interval with or without a chi site gives chi hotspot activity. both deletion and substitution fusion mutants produced high chi hotspot activities similar to that of wild-type cells , indicating that more exchange occurs in an interval with a chi site than that an interval without one. recbcd null mutants and recd mutants produced no chi hotspot activity .

recb-recd fusion mutants on plasmids have wild type phenotypes
the phenotypes of the recb-recd fusion mutants on plasmids were tested by spot tests  <cit>  . λ red-gam-χ+produced larger plaques than λ red-gam-χ <dig>  t <dig> formed plaques, but t <dig> gene 2- did not. p <dig> and p <dig> produced plaques. it was concluded that recb-recd fusion mutants on plasmids are recombination-proficient and they have chi activity and exonuclease activity.

there are recbd fusion polypeptides
we wanted to determine whether the construction of a recb-recd fusion leads to an active recbd fusion polypeptide. for this purpose, we performed native and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude extracts and blotted them. recbd fusion polypeptides were detected on sds-page probed with anti-recb and anti-recd , and recc polypeptide was detected when the gels were probed with anti-recc . in the native gel, less heterotrimer was found in the two fusion mutants than in purified recbcd, but neither intact recb polypeptide nor recbc was detected in cell extracts of either fusion mutant . unexpectedly, a polypeptide with size similar to recd was observed .

recbdc fusion enzymes have atp-dependent exonuclease activity
because the fusion peptides were found on gels and they were recombination-proficient, we wondered whether the fusion mutants have enzyme activities. we first tested exonuclease activity in them. recbcd degrades linear dna to acid-soluble nucleotides by two activities, dsdna and ssdna exonucleases, both of which are atp-dependent. we measured only atp-dependent dsdna exonuclease activity in this work  <cit> ; in both fusion mutants, it was approximately half that in wild type . this result is consistent with the qualitative assays for exonuclease activity with t <dig>  t <dig> gene  <dig> and p <dig> .

recbdc fusion enzymes have dna unwinding and chi cutting activities
since the fusion enzymes are recombination-proficient and have chi genetic activity, we wanted to demonstrate dna unwinding and chi cutting activities, which are measured together on linear dsdna labeled with 32p at the 5' end of a single strand containing a chi site  <cit> . in the presence of excess magnesium, wild-type recbcd binds to dsdna ends and degrades the 3'-ended strand until chi site, so few if any ssdna fragments are found. after chi, the enzyme cuts ssdna a few nucleotides to the 3' side of chi and forms a chi fragment  . when we tested the fusion enzymes for this activity, the deletion fusion mutant enzyme had unwinding and exonuclease activities, so it did not produce a full-length ssdna fragment but could cut near chi and form chi fragments . similarly, the substitution fusion mutant enzyme unwound dsdna and degraded the 3'-end strand, so it did not form an ssdna fragment but formed chi fragments . these observations are consistent with the phage test results.

recb-recd fusion mutants are resistant to dna damaging agents
the viability of the fusion mutant cells was tested by their sensitivity to dna damaging agents  <cit> . deletion and substitution fusion mutants were just as resistant to uv radiation as the recbcd wild type strain when compared to pbr <dig> . both fusion mutants showed similar ability to the recbcd wild type strain in reducing dna damage induced by mitomycin c , but plasmids were sensitive. these data show that recb-recd fusions do not inhibit dna repair.

discussion
we set out to characterize the regulatory function of recd. to our knowledge, this is the first study involving the generation of genetic fusions between two recbcd subunits. we observed that the fusion enzymes have wild type phenotypes. below, we discuss possible inferences from our results.

fusion enzymes resemble wild type
the phenotypes of the fusion enzymes were demonstrated by genetic and enzymatic assays . the deletion fusion enzyme is recombination proficient and resistant to dna damaging agents . in contrast to recbc, this mutant enzyme has nuclease and chi genetic activities . it can unwind dsdna as wild type enzyme does and recognizes the chi sequence because it forms chi fragments . similarly, we found that the substitution fusion enzyme is recombination proficient and resistant to dna damaging agents . this mutant enzyme has chi activity, nuclease and helicase activities, and also recognizes chi . our findings indicate that both fusion enzymes can bind to dsdna ends and unwind double strands. during unwinding they can recognize the chi sequence and form a 3' overhang. after interaction with chi, wild type recbcd enzyme loads reca protein on to the free 3' end  <cit> , which allows pairing and strand exchange with homologues  <cit> , so this activity is required for homologous recombination  <cit> . we did not measure reca loading activity in this study, but the genetic measure of recombination proficiency and enzymatic measure of chi recognition  <cit>  afford evidence for such activity.

fusion enzymes are active
in our mutations we removed the stop codon of recb, so translation continued to the end of the recd coding sequence and produced a recbd fusion heterodimer, which might affect the folding of the enzyme and consequently its functions. folding is a rapid process initiated by local elements that assemble to yield the final native fold  <cit> . our protein analysis indicated not only the presence of recbd fusion polypeptide, as we expected , but also the absence of intact recb monomer and recbc dimer . this result is the most important evidence for a recbd fusion heterodimer. an intact recc that we found is essential for assembly and association into holoenzyme. however, we observed that the amount of heterotrimer was lower than in wild type. one possible explanation is that the assembly of the fusion protein to form the heterotrimer was affected because an oligomeric protein is formed by consecutive folding and association of the constituent polypeptides. a more significant finding than the reduction of heterotrimer level is recd with wild type length. this indicates that the recd polypeptide is expressed by its minor promoter, which may affect the assembly process. in e. coli, recb and recd form an operon with two promoters; the major promoter is external and directs the transcription of both genes, whereas the minor one is internal and appears to direct the transcription of recd. a similar promoter composition is found in other e. coli operons such as glnalg and rpsu-dnag-rpod; the minor promoter allows downstream genes to be transcribed under certain conditions  <cit> . however, it is not yet clear when the weaker promoter for recd governs, so we did not take it into consideration at the outset. nevertheless, wild type length recd could bind to rec-recc assembly and could make rec-recc-recd enzyme that might be responsible for the functionality .

during our study the three-dimensional structure of recbcd was discovered. it was found that the distance between  <dig> of recb polypeptide and  <dig> of recd polypeptide is about  <dig>  Å  , which is longer than was thought. this distance corresponds to about  <dig> amino acids. however, in our study, three amino acids were substituted between  <dig> of recb and  <dig> of recd, so it corresponds to total  <dig> amino acids . therefore at least seven more amino acids may be required to fuse recb and recd. furthermore, this long distance between c-terminal of recb and n-terminal of recd may cause a functional enzyme which may be assembled by rec-recc-rec, in which recb and recd come from two different polypeptides.

genetic studies showed that there is little or no chi hotspot activity in frameshift or single amino acid mutations of recc  <cit> . therefore it was proposed that hotspot chi is recognized by recc as the 3' single strand dna during unwinding  <cit> . it was suggested that this recognition initiates a signal, which causes a change in recd polypeptide to form 3'overhang to the left of chi for reca loading  <cit> . based on our observations, it can be suggested that this signaling in both recbdc fusion enzymes would retain in response to chi.

the results presented here suggest that recbd fusion enzymes have wild type phenotype and fully active. however, considering the distance between c-terminal of recb and n-terminal of recd in the three-dimensional structure, and the presence of wild type-length recd, unusual subunit associations such as rec-recc-recd and rec-recc-rec may be formed and may be responsible for the activity. to rule out this possibility, purification of those discrete molecules and then their extensive biochemical assays are required. for this purpose, purification methods, sds-page analysis and maldi-tof ms can be performed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
recb-recd genetic fusion in e. coli demonstrates that recbdc fusion enzymes are recombination proficient and active as well as wild type, so we infer that three-dimensional structure of fusion proteins does not change. the reduced heterotrimer formation may arise from the failure of recd assembly process. however, wild type length recd requires a purification to eliminate subunit associations that might be responsible for the enzyme activities.
