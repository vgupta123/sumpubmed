BACKGROUND
microbial biofilm formation is an important virulence mechanism, which allows immune evasion and survival against antibiotic treatments  <cit> . many bacterial nosocomial infections are associated with biofilms formed on contaminated medical devices. dispersal of biofilm has also been proposed to augment infection spread  <cit> . for group a streptococcus , biofilm research is an emerging field and little is known about the specific surface determinants that aid in biofilm formation. gas is characteristically associated with significant human morbidity and it is responsible for the clinically common superficial throat and skin infections, such as pharyngitis and impetigo, as well as invasive soft tissue and blood infections like necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome  <cit> . although gas biofilm has not been associated with implanted medical devices, tissue microcolonies of gas encased in an extracellular matrix were demonstrated in human clinical specimens  <cit> . studies reported to date support the involvement of gas surface components in biofilm formation, including the m and m-like proteins, hyaluronic acid capsule, pili and lipoteichoic acid  <cit> . as shown by cho and caparon  <cit> , multiple genes are upregulated during biofilm formation and development, including the streptococcal collagen-like protein- <dig> .

the scl <dig> gene encoding the scl <dig> protein has been found in every gas strain investigated and its transcription is positively regulated by mga  <cit> , indicating that scl <dig> is co-expressed with a number of proven virulence factors. structurally, the extracellular portion of scl <dig> protein extends from the gas surface as a homotrimeric molecule composed of distinct domains that include the most outward n-terminal variable  region and the adjacent collagen-like  region composed of repeating glyxaayaa  sequence. the linker  region is close to the cell surface and contains a series of conserved direct repeats. the scl <dig> protein can bind selected human extracellular matrix components  <cit>  and cellular integrin receptors  <cit> , as well as plasma components  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the importance of scl <dig> in gas biofilm using defined isogenic wild-type and scl1-inactivated mutant strains of gas. we report that  the pathogenically diverse m41-, m28-, m3- and m1-type gas wild-type strains have varying capacities to produce biofilm on an abiotic surface;  scl <dig> plays an important role during the main stages of biofilm formation with scl1-negative mutants having an abrogated capacity for adhesion, microcolony formation and biofilm maturation; and  variations in surface morphology as well as in extracellular matrix associated with bacterial cells suggest two distinct but plausible mechanisms that potentially stabilize bacterial microcolonies. we additionally show that expression of scl <dig> in lactococcus lactis is sufficient to support a biofilm phenotype. overall, this work reveals a significant role for the scl <dig> protein as a cell-surface component during gas biofilm formation among pathogenically varying strains.

RESULTS
wild-type gas strains have heterogeneous capacity for biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces
biofilm formation was compared between m41-, m28-, m3- and m1-type gas strains representing distinct epidemiological traits . to assess biofilm formation after  <dig> h, we used spectrophotometric measurements recorded following crystal violet staining . both the m41- and m28-type strains produced more biomass as compared with m <dig> strain. furthermore, the m3-type strain produced the lowest absorbance values in a crystal violet assay, indicative of lower cell biomass, as compared with the other wild-type strains. these experiments confirm previous observations  <cit>  that gas strains have varying capacity to form biofilm in vitro.

the failure of m3-type strain mgas <dig> to produce substantial cellular biomass in the above assay was intriguing because sequence analysis of the scl <dig>  allele found in mgas <dig> revealed the presence of a taa stop codon in the 11th gxy repeat of the scl <dig> -cl region containing a total of  <dig> gxy triplets  <cit> . this premature stop codon results in a truncated scl <dig>  variant composed of  <dig> amino acids , which does not contain the cell wall-membrane  associated region, thus, preventing it from anchoring to the bacterial cell surface . this prompted us to investigate the biofilm formation by five additional m3-type strains, all harboring the same scl <dig>  allele. five additional m3-type strains, mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  mgas <dig> and mgas <dig>  all harboring the same scl <dig>  allele  <cit>  also produced poor biofilm under static conditions, as measured by crystal violet staining. confocal laser scanning microscopy  of three representative strains  corroborated results obtained from the crystal violet assay, indicating that these m3-type strains lack the ability to form appreciable biofilm structure. our data suggest that the lack of capacity for biofilm-formation among m3-type gas strains examined here might be correlated, at least in part, with lack of surface-attached scl <dig>  protein.

microscopic evaluation reveals differences in biofilm surface morphology
we next conducted microscopic analysis of the biofilms formed by the wild-type  m41-, m28-, and m1-type gas strains. first, we examined the overall structural characteristics of biofilms formed after  <dig> h using clsm . the average biofilm thickness  differed among all three strains with m <dig> producing considerably thinner biofilm  compared to m <dig>  and m <dig> , a result consistent with lower spectrophotometric absorbance values . in addition to measured differences in biofilm thickness, closer examination of the x-y orthogonal z-stack views, representing biofilm cross-sections, revealed architectural differences among the m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> biofilms. the m <dig> biofilm, although the thinnest, seems to consist of densely-packed cells that form continuous layers, while the m <dig> and especially m <dig> biofilms seem to be less dense but exhibit more elevated supracellular assembly. we therefore used field emission scanning electron microscopy  to define more accurately these supracellular differences observed by clsm between the biofilms produced by the wt m <dig> and m <dig> gas . fesem exposed notable architectural differences between biofilms formed by these two strains. the m <dig>  biofilm was characterized by more diverse surface architecture with the evidence of depressions or crypts, whereas the m <dig> biofilm  seems to lack such pronounced surface characteristics. at higher magnification, the m <dig> cells have a studded cell surface morphology with protrusions linking both sister cells and cells in adjacent chains . in contrast, the m <dig> cells had a relatively smoother appearance likely due to the rich bacterial-associated extracellular matrix  surrounding these cells and covering their surface . baem material, which was clearly seen at higher resolution between the m1-type cells, was not as evident between cells of the m41-type gas.

gas biofilms differ in production of bacterial-associated extracellular matrix
the production of baem has been shown to be an integral component in the structural integrity of a biofilm, imparting protection from dehydration, host immune attack, and antibiotic sensitivity  <cit> . gas cells encased in a glycocalyx were first identified by akiyama et al. in skin biopsies obtained from impetigo patients. we therefore compared the production of baem within biofilms employing gfp-expressing gas strains of the m <dig> and m <dig> type . cells were grown to form biofilms on glass cover slips for  <dig> h and stained with tritc-concanavalin a , a fluorescently-labeled lectin that binds to the extracellular polysaccharides in biofilms  <cit> . fluorescent microscopy was performed to compare matrix production  by gas strains . visual screening of both biofilms indicated that the m41-type strain formed a more dispersed extracellular matrix as compared to the m <dig> strain, which had a dense, more closely associated matrix. in addition, averages of at least  <dig> fields of cona stained matrix by clsm support our fesem observations that more baem is deposited within the biofilm by the m <dig> gas cells as compared to m <dig> gas. this is in agreement with the report from akiyama et al that showed a substantial fitc-cona stained matrix associated with t1-type gas microcolonies in vivo and in vitro  <cit> .

scl <dig> protein significantly contributes to biofilm formation by gas
variations in gas pathogenicity and capacity to form biofilm are driven by specific proteins and components present on the cell surface or are secreted by the organism. it has been shown that deletion of the m and m-like surface proteins or capsule, as well as increased expression of the secreted speb protease decreases biofilm formation dramatically for some strains of gas  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the role of scl <dig> in biofilm formation by comparing biofilms formed by gas wt and scl1-inactivated  mutant strains . bacterial biomass was evaluated spectrophotometrically following crystal violet staining at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h time points, representing different stages of biofilm formation, and absorbance values rendered for the wt and Δscl <dig> isogenic mutant strains were compared. the m41Δscl <dig> mutant showed a 29-35% decrease in biofilm formation , which was sustained throughout all time points. this reduction was statistically significant at initial adherence , as well as during biofilm development  and at maturation  . complementation of scl <dig>  expression in the m41Δscl <dig> mutant  restored its ability to form biofilm to wt levels. similarly, the m28Δscl <dig> mutant had a significantly decreased capacity for biofilm formation in the range of 29-44% as compared to wt strain . likewise, there was a statistically significant decrease in m1Δscl <dig> biofilm biomass by ~42-75% compared to the wt strain . clsm analysis of corresponding 24-h biofilms of these strains confirmed our crystal violet staining results at  <dig> h. the Δscl <dig> mutants had substantially decreased average biofilm thickness by more than 50%  as compared to the parental wt organisms . while these low average biofilm thickness values measured for the m1Δscl <dig>  and m28Δscl <dig>  correspond to residual biofilms made by those mutants , by comparison, the m1Δscl <dig>  was shown not to produce a continuous biofilm layer under these conditions . our data support the hypothesis that the scl <dig> protein plays an important functional role during gas biofilm formation and that scl <dig> contribution varies among gas strains with different genetic backgrounds.

scl <dig> expression affects surface hydrophobicity
the surface hydrophobicity of gas has been shown to influence the adherence to abiotic surfaces. the presence of pili  <cit> , m and m-like proteins, and lipoteichoic acid contributes to cell surface hydrophobic properties  <cit> , which in turn may influence biofilm formation by gas. here, we have investigated the contribution of scl <dig> to surface hydrophobicity of m41-, m28-, and m1-type gas strains using a modified hexadecane binding assay  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the m28-type gas strain mgas <dig> gave the highest actual hydrophobicity value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , followed by the m41-type strain mgas <dig> . in contrast, the overall surface hydrophobicity of the m1-type gas strain mgas <dig>  was significantly lower compared to both m <dig> and m <dig> strains . inactivation of scl <dig>  in m41-type gas resulted in a modest, although statistically significant, reduction in the hydrophobicity index . in-trans complementation of the scl <dig>  expression in m41Δscl1-c restored the hydrophobic phenotype of the cells to wt level . in comparison, the contribution of the scl <dig>  and scl <dig>  proteins to surface hydrophobicity is more substantial, as evidenced by a ~21% and ~22% reduction of the hydrophobicity indices of the mutants as compared to the corresponding wt strains, respectively . thus, the scl1-mediated gas-cell surface hydrophobicity reported here may contribute to the ability of this organism to form biofilm, as suggested for other cell surface components  <cit> .

scl <dig> is sufficient to support biofilm formation in lactococcus lactis
to assess whether scl <dig> expression is sufficient to confer the ability for biofilm formation, we chose to express this protein in a heterologous l. lactis system  <cit> . the wild-type l. lactis strain mg <dig> was transformed with plasmid psl <dig> encoding the scl <dig>  protein  <cit>  or with the shuttle vector pjrs <dig> alone. as shown in figure 5a, pcr amplification of the scl <dig>  gene employing specific primers yielded no product from the wt l. lactis mg <dig>  and the mg1363::pjrs <dig> transformant . a product of the expected size of  <dig>  kb was amplified from the psl <dig> plasmid dna control  as well as was amplified from the mg1363::psl <dig> transformant . surface expression of scl <dig>  was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell-wall extracts prepared from l. lactis wt, and the mg1363::pjrs <dig> and mg1363::psl <dig> transformants, as well as mgas <dig> . as shown in figure 5b, rabbit antiserum raised against purified recombinant scl <dig>  protein p <dig> lacking the wm region detected the corresponding immunogen , and the homologous full length protein in cell-wall extracts of mgas <dig>  as well as mg1363::psl <dig> l. lactis transformant . this band was absent in cell-wall extracts prepared from the wt l. lactis mg <dig>  and mg1363::pjrs <dig> transformant . expression of scl <dig>  at the cell surface was further established by flow cytometry. rabbit anti-p <dig> antibodies stained scl <dig>  mg1363::psl <dig> transformant, confirming the expression of scl <dig>  protein at the cell surface in the heterologous host l. lactis . this protein was absent at the surface of wt mg <dig>  and mg1363::pjrs <dig> transformant .

the capacity of l. lactis expressing scl <dig>  to form biofilm was evaluated spectrophotometrically following crystal violet staining. as shown in figure 5d, the mg1363::psl <dig> transformant demonstrated a significant increase in biofilm-associated biomass at  <dig> h, as compared to wild type l. lactis or l. lactis-containing pjrs <dig> vector . crystal violet stained wells were photographed for visual representation of biofilm formation prior to spectrophotometric assay. biofilm thickness and architecture were evaluated by clsm . the mg1363::psl <dig> transformant produced a substantially thicker biofilm  as compared to both mg <dig> wt  and the vector-only transformant mg1363::pjrs <dig> . the mg1363::psl <dig> cells formed highly aggregated structures, thus, acquiring a phenotype consistent with biofilm formation. as shown in table  <dig>  the mg1363::psl <dig> transformant, expressing scl <dig>  surface protein, had significantly enhanced cell surface hydrophobicity  with an actual value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , when compared to the mg <dig> wt  and the vector-only mgas1363::pjrs <dig> control . these data suggest a direct relationship between scl <dig> expression and cell surface hydrophobicity and establish their involvement in the microorganism's ability to form biofilm in vitro.

discussion
group a streptococcus strains vary because of the vast number of m-protein types, and this variation is associated with varying frequency of isolation and exacerbation of disease  <cit> . the m41-, m28-, m3-, and m1-type strains selected for the current study represent a significant intraspecies diversity among clinical isolates of gas. m <dig> gas was a major causative agent of superficial skin infections  <cit> , and strain mgas <dig>  harboring the scl <dig>  protein, has been studied extensively  <cit> . m28-type gas  has historically been associated with puerperal fever and currently is responsible for extensive human infections world-wide  <cit> . m1t <dig> gas, represented by strain mgas <dig>  is a globally disseminated clone responsible for both pharyngitis and invasive infections  <cit> . the m3-type strains of gas cause a disproportionally large number of invasive gas infections that are responsible for traumatic morbidity and death  <cit> .

initial studies by lembke et al. that characterized biofilm formation among various m types of gas typically included several strains of the same m type  <cit> . these studies reported a significant strain-to-strain variation in ability to form biofilms within each m type. studies that followed compared biofilm formation by defined isogenic wt and mutant strains to assess the contribution of specific gas surface components responsible for a biofilm phenotype, including m and m-like proteins, hyaluronic acid capsule, lipoteichoic acid, and pili  <cit> . in the current study, we have assessed the role and contribution of the surface protein scl <dig> in the ability to support biofilm formation by gas strains of four distinct m types.

recent advances in molecular mega- and pathogenomics has enabled the characterization of numerous m3-type strains with a single nucleotide resolution  <cit> . interestingly, all five m3-type strains mgas <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that were originally used for scl1-gene sequencing  <cit> , plus an additional strain mgas <dig>  harbor the same scl <dig>  allele containing a null mutation that would result in secretion of a truncated scl <dig> -protein variant. here, we demonstrate that these gas strains do not form biofilm on an abiotic surface. recently, bioinformatic screening of the sequences of ~ <dig> invasive m3-type strains isolated globally, has led to the detection of this single nucleotide polymorphism that results in disruption of scl <dig>  protein . lembke et al. reported heterogeneous biofilm formation among four m3-type gas strains examined over a  <dig>   <dig>  and 72-h period  <cit> . biofilm was detected for one strain at a  <dig> h time point, on a fibrinogen-coated surface; however, it is not known whether this clinical isolate forms biofilm on abiotic surface, whether it expresses the truncated or full-length scl <dig>  protein, and whether it produces an unknown fibrinogen-binding protein, which could augment the attachment and biofilm formation. therefore, additional studies are necessary to define the contributions of other biofilm-formation determinants in m3-type strains.

inasmuch as, variation in biofilm formation among gas isolates of the same m-type has been established, the molecular basis of this phenotypic variation is not known. several gas surface-associated and secreted components were shown to contribute to variation in biofilm  <cit> . in addition, transcription regulators, such as mga, covr, and srv are likely to play substantial roles in gas biofilm formation  <cit>  due to their transcriptional regulation of numerous genes. therefore, it is logical to assume that the combination of genomic/proteomic make up, allelic polymorphisms, and transcription regulation all contribute to this phenomenon. in addition, discrepancies between in vitro data obtained with laboratory-stored strains and microcolony formation in vivo likely exist and add yet another unknown to the complexity of gas biofilm/microcolony formation and its role in pathogenesis. despite this complexity, the analyses involving isogenic strains of the same genetic background provide valuable information that allows assessment of the role and contribution of a given gas component to biofilm formation.

the m <dig> mgas <dig> strain was shown to form biofilm in vitro and in experimental animals  <cit> , and the present study demonstrates a significant role of scl <dig>  in this process. likewise, the mgas <dig> strain, representing m41-type isolates often associated with pyoderma, produced a more robust biofilm biomass under the same experimental conditions and scl <dig> -deficient mutant was found to be an important determinant in this process. similarly, scl <dig>  protein significantly contributes to a robust biofilm made by the m28-type strain mgas <dig>  however, a recent study reported that another surface protein, designated aspa, found in m28-type gas significantly contributed to biofilm formation  <cit> . the Δaspa isogenic mutant showed 60% reduction in biofilm formation. the strain mgas <dig>  which they used, expresses the same scl <dig>  variant present in the mgas <dig> strain we used; our scl <dig>  mutant showed ~44% reduction in  <dig> h biofilm. we propose that several surface proteins contribute to biofilm formation by m28-type strains including proteins aspa and scl <dig> , and potentially, proteins f1/sfbi and f <dig> that are also present in these strains  <cit> . this redundancy is likely responsible for the observed residual biofilms produced by the aspa- and scl <dig> -deficient mutants.

the observed heterogeneity in biofilm architecture of different gas strains was previously observed by lembke et al.  <cit>  and was also documented in the current study using fesem. in addition, here we report the differences in gas-cell surface morphology and within cell-to-cell junctions in biofilms formed by m1- and m41-type strains. the structural and genetic determination of these differences is not known since m <dig> genome has not been sequenced, but may be associated with the presence of additional surface proteins, such as the f <dig> protein  <cit>  encoded by prtf <dig> gene found in this strain  <cit> . even more striking was an observed difference in the amount of the extracellular material associated with each strain, referred to as baem . it has been shown that extracellular matrix, also called glycocalyx, is produced by biofilm-forming bacteria. dna, lipids, proteins  <cit> , polysaccharides and dead cell debris  <cit>  were identified in this matrix and for gram-positive bacteria, teichoic acids have also been detected  <cit> . the exopolysaccharide component of the glycocalyx is detected using carbohydrate-binding lectins, such as concanavalin a   <cit> . both fesem analysis and cona staining detected more baem associated with m <dig> biofilm compared to m <dig>  which produced larger biofilm. these observations suggest that gas biofilm is stabilized differently by different strains and that higher baem production does not necessarily pre-determine larger biofilm mass. consequently, a combination of biofilm features rather than biofilm size alone may be more relevant to pathogenicity of a given gas strain.

diminished adherence and biofilm formation could be associated with changes in cell surface hydrophobicity  <cit>  of the scl <dig> mutants. indeed, the lack of scl <dig> resulted in both decreased hydrophobicity and the ability to form biofilm, albeit in a somewhat disproportionate manner. a decrease in the hydrophobicity index by only ~8%, as compared to the wild type-strain, was measured for the m41Δscl <dig> mutant and this modest decrease was accompanied by a rather large reduction in biofilm formation capacity after  <dig> h by 30%. greater decrease in cell-surface hydrophobicity was measured for the m1Δscl <dig>  and m28Δscl <dig>  mutants, which was accompanied by a significant loss in biofilm formation after  <dig> h by both isogenic strains by ~55% and ~41% , respectively. in addition, heterologous expression of scl. <dig> in l. lactis increased hydrophobicity index of this organism to ~137% of the wt level, which was accompanied by significant increase in its ability to form biofilm. similar observations have been reported for the m and m-like protein mutants that typically, but not always, exhibit concurrent loss of both biological features  <cit> . for example, isogenic Δmrp <dig> mutant had a non-significant drop in hydrophobicity  but significantly lower biofilm formation after  <dig> h by ~30%, whereas Δemm <dig> mutant lost ~78% hydrophobicity and ~44% biofilm formation capacity. in summary:  here we report that the scl <dig> adhesin is also a hydrophobin with varying contribution to the overall surface hydrophobicity among gas strains representing different m types and  scl1-associated surface hydrophobicity is likely to contribute to scl1-mediated biofilm formation.

to test whether scl <dig> alone could support biofilm formation, we used a heterologous l. lactis strain, which provides an expression system for membrane-bound proteins of gram- positive bacteria with lpxtg cell-wall anchoring motifs  <cit> , including the group a streptococcal m <dig> protein  <cit> . in a recent study by maddocks et al.  <cit>  it was shown that heterologous expression of aspa gas surface protein was able to induce a biofilm phenotype in l. lactis mg <dig>  we were also able to achieve a gain-of-function derivative of the l. lactis wt mg <dig> strain, , displaying an altered phenotype associated with biofilm formation, as compared to wild-type parental and vector-only controls. these data support our current model that scl <dig> protein is an important determinant of gas biofilm formation.

as shown by crystal violet staining and clsm, biofilm formation by the scl1-negative mutants was compromised during the initial stage of adherence, as well as microcolony stabilization and maturation. consequently, their capacity for biofilm formation as compared to the respective wt controls was greatly reduced. this comparison identifies for the first time that the scl <dig> protein contributes significantly to biofilm assembly and stability. based on these observations, as well as previous work by us and others, we propose the following model of scl <dig> contribution to gas tissue microcolony formation . first, the scl <dig> hydrophobin  initiates bacterial adhesion to animate surfaces within the host  <cit> . next, the scl <dig> adhesin anchors the outside edge of growing microcolony in tissue by direct binding to tissue extracellular matrix components, cellular fibronectin and laminin  <cit> . microcolony development is stabilized by scl1-scl <dig> scaffolding resulting from scl1's capacity to form head-to-head dimers  <cit>  between molecules located on adjacent chains. this model will be tested experimentally in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, using pathogenically differing gas strains, we have demonstrated three concepts. first, we have confirmed previous observations that biofilm formation is an innate property of gas strains. the m41-type strain used formed a more robust biofilm when compared to m28-type strain as well as m1-type strain. importantly, the highly invasive m3-type strains devoid of the surface-associated scl <dig> also lack the ability to form biofilm. secondly, the absence of surface-associated scl <dig> decreases gas-cell hydrophobicity suggesting that scl <dig> plays a role on the gas surface as a hydrophobin. thirdly, we have established that the scl <dig> protein is a significant determinant for gas biofilm formation. this concept was further tested by the heterologous expression of scl <dig> in lactococcus, an organism found in dairy fermentation environments, enabling it to form biofilm. altogether, these data underscore the importance of scl <dig> in biofilm-associated regulation of gas pathogenicity. recently published work has shown that the recombinant scl <dig> binds to the extracellular matrix components, cellular fibronectin and laminin  <cit> . our current research provides a foundation warranting additional investigation as to whether direct scl1-ecm binding may promote gas biofilm as a bridging mechanism within host tissues.
