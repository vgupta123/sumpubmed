BACKGROUND
calcitonin gene-related peptide  released from sensory fibers originating in the trigeminal ganglia  <cit>  or the adventitial-medial border of arteries supplying the heart  <cit>  causes a potent, efficacious and long-lasting dilation of cerebral and coronary vessels, respectively  <cit> . vasodilatation of cerebral arteries by cgrp released from trigeminal fibers is implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches  <cit> . conversely, vasodilatation by cgrp released in the peripheral vasculature might be of considerable importance to patients suffering from hypertension and/or heart disease  <cit> . for example, it has been demonstrated that cgrp is essential for myocardial protection, during reperfusion injury, either in ischemic preconditioning or in heat stress-induced cardioprotection  <cit> . however, lack of small molecule non-peptide cgrp receptor agonists or antagonists limit the essential investigations that would assess the role of this neuropeptide in vascular related diseases.

structure-function relationships of cgrp have been extensively studied and are highlighted in a review by wimalawansa  <cit> . briefly, this  <dig> amino acid neuropeptide can be divided into two distinct domains based upon its binding and agonistic properties for the receptor. the first n-terminal residues  have been shown to be essential for receptor activation  <cit> . specifically, loss of the disulfide bridge connecting amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> negates all biological activity of the endogenous neuropeptide  <cit> . however, deleting this portion of the cgrp molecule does not appear to be critical for receptor affinity  <cit> . conversely, the n-terminal truncated peptide, cgrp, is an effective cgrp receptor antagonist having a high affinity for the receptor but devoid of any biological activity in itself  <cit> . more specifically, the amidated c-terminal phenylalanine at position  <dig> of cgrp has been shown to be necessary for receptor interaction since deletion of this peptide residue or loss of the c-terminal amine results in a significant deficiency of high affinity binding  <cit> . this affinity loss of des-f37-cgrp for the native receptor when compared to the endogenous neuropeptide is not due to disruption of the ligand structure  <cit> . instead, it is postulated that the c-terminal phenylalaninamide of the ligand directly interacts with the mature cgrp receptor in order for this high affinity binding to occur. moreover, conservative substitution of f <dig> for tyrosine, which adds only one hydroxyl group to the phenol ring, again causes a significant loss of binding affinity, supporting the idea that cgrp-f <dig> is essential for high affinity interaction with the mature receptor protein  <cit> . in addition, an α-helical configuration incorporating residues 8– <dig> and β-sheet structures related to amino acids 18– <dig> and 32– <dig> are also thought to contribute to the high affinity receptor antagonist profile of cgrp  <cit> . however, there is no information in the literature regarding specific interactions of the receptor with these identified ligand domains, particularly the c-terminus phenylalaninamide of cgrp.

the receptor for cgrp is a heptahelical membrane protein that belongs to the group b family of g protein-coupled receptors . this gpcr family is distinct from the well characterized group a rhodopsin family of gpcrs in the fact that group b members have long extracellular n-terminus domains and utilize moderately sized peptides as their endogenous agonists  <cit> . the human clone for this receptor has been identified and named the calcitonin-like receptor  protein based on sequence identity to the calcitonin receptor  <cit> . however, transient mammalian cell expression of the human clr clone could not be achieved until identification of a single transmembrane protein family called receptor-activity-modifying proteins  that are essential for trafficking mature clr proteins to the cell membrane surface  <cit> . in this study, heterodimerization of clr-ramp <dig> on the membrane surface was shown to exhibit the pharmacological profile of an endogenously expressed cgrp receptor. conversely, interaction of clr with ramp <dig> or  <dig> on the membrane surface demonstrated the pharmacological receptor profile for a related peptide, adrenomedullin . therefore, cell specific expression of distinctive ramps with the clr imparts selective pharmacological receptor profiles for related peptide families.

structure-function studies of group b gpcr families have documented important interactions of the characteristically long n-terminal domain with their endogenous peptide ligands  <cit> . recent evidence has also addressed the importance of the clr n-terminal domain for docking with the endogenous neuropeptide. for example, a purified clr n-terminal domain overexpressed in e. coli was able to specifically bind 125i-cgrp and could displace this same radiolabeled peptide from a membrane preparation containing native cgrp receptors  <cit> . this observation supports previous structure-function analysis of cgrp that describe two separate peptide domains essential for binding and agonism  <cit> . a model illustrating this interaction of specific cgrp domains with the clr-ramp <dig> heterodimer  is presented in figure  <dig> 

specific to the clr, deletion of an  <dig> amino acid region of the receptor n-terminal domain resulted in a significant loss of 125i-cgrp binding when co-expressed in mammalian cells with ramp <dig>  <cit> . however, this clr deletion mutant was able to generate camp in a concentration-dependent manner with increasing amounts of cgrp. for our investigation, we considered whether the essential c-terminus phenylalaninamide of cgrp was contributing to high affinity neuropeptide binding by directly interacting with hydrophobic amino acids found within this deleted clr n-terminal domain. therefore, we used site-directed mutagenesis techniques to change these hydrophobic clr residues to alanine, then characterized the binding and signaling properties of these transiently expressed clr mutants for the endogenous or modified neuropeptides, comparing the results to wild type receptor. in this study, we identify two specific leucine residues within this n-terminal domain of the clr that significantly contribute to the high affinity binding of cgrp without appreciably affecting receptor function.

RESULTS
competitive radioligand binding properties of cgrp and modified peptide ligands for wild type and mutant clrs
previous investigations have identified cgrp as a selective high affinity radioligand for mature cgrp receptors  endogenously expressed in rat brain and peripheral tissues  <cit> . therefore, we used this same radiochemical to recognize mature cgrp binding sites on hek293t-ramp <dig> cells that had been transiently transfected with mutant and wild type clrs. crude membrane preparations from these transfected hek293t-ramp <dig> cells were used in saturation binding experiments with increasing concentrations of cgrp in the absence or presence of 1μm cgrp to define nonspecific binding. preliminary studies using non-transfected hek293t-ramp <dig> membranes or membranes isolated from cells transiently transfected with empty vector demonstrated no specific binding with increasing concentrations of the radioligand . conversely, hek293t-ramp <dig> membranes transiently expressing the wild type clr demonstrated a saturable rise in specific binding as a result of increasing cgrp concentrations . the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand  and the maximal specific binding of cgrp  calculated from non-linear regression analysis was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig> ±  <dig> fmols/mg of wild type membrane protein, respectively . this kd value is similar to affinity constants calculated for this radioligand when used in other investigations to identify endogenous cgrp receptor binding sites  <cit> . analogous saturation binding experiments were performed for the l24a, l34a and l24a,l34a clr double mutant transiently expressed individually on hek293t-ramp <dig> membranes with an approximate 10-fold decrease in the cgrp kd value calculated for all receptor mutations . these kd values were used to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants  of competing cgrp receptor active ligands for transiently expressed wild type and mutant clr-ramp <dig> heterodimers using the method of cheng and prusoff  <cit> .

h and l represent high and low binding affinity values respectively calculated from a complex curve fitting model of the data points.

increasing concentrations of cgrp or the n-terminally acetylated peptide fragment, accgrp were used to inhibit specific cgrp binding to membranes prepared from hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently transfected with wild type or mutant clrs. specific cgrp binding was plotted versus increasing concentrations of the endogenous or modified neuropeptide and a competition curve for each membrane preparation was generated using non-linear regression analysis . when the ic <dig> of these curves were used to calculate the ki of cgrp for these transiently expressed membrane proteins , there was a significant  <dig> to 8-fold decrease in affinity values for all mutant receptors  when compared to wild type clr . likewise, the ki of accgrp calculated from competition binding experiments  using transiently transfected wild type clr membranes  was similar to the equilibrium dissociation constant  estimated from functional characterization of endogenous cgrp receptors expressed in the guinea pig atria  <cit> . however, there was a significant  <dig> to 20-fold decrease in the ki values of accgrp for the l24a , l34a  and l24a,l34a  double mutant clr when compared to wild type . since the amidated f <dig> is a common residue not only of the radioligand, but also the two competitive peptides, similarities in binding affinity loss lend support to our hypothesis that hydrophobic n-terminus clr amino acids are docking with the c-terminal phenylalaninamide of the neuropeptide. furthermore, there were no significant differences in affinity values of the endogenous or modified competitive peptides for single and double leucine clr mutations, suggesting that no synergistic binding relationship between cgrp-f <dig> and these hydrophobic clr residues is occurring.

to specifically test this hypothesis we used modified peptide ligands, which lacked the c-terminus phenylalanine in additional competitive radioligand binding experiments. there was a significant affinity loss of the c-terminal amidated ligand, cgrp, for the wild type clr transiently expressed on hek293t-ramp <dig> membranes when compared to the ki of cgrp for the same receptor . however, there were no differences in cgrp affinity values for l24a, l34a and l24a,l34a receptor mutants when compared to wild type clr. to confirm these observations we utilized another truncated cgrp fragment, which was not amidated at the carboxyl terminus. similar to results using cgrp, there was a significant loss of cgrp affinity for the wild type clr when compared to the endogenous neuropeptide at the same receptor . nevertheless, this cgrp affinity for the wild type receptor was analogous to values calculated for all leucine clr mutations. these results emphasized the importance of the c-terminal f <dig> as an important binding contact for the wild type clr . in addition, the lack of cgrp or cgrp affinity value changes for mutant compared to wild type clrs, suggests that n-terminus leucines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> on the receptor might be interacting with f <dig> of the endogenous neuropeptide.

signaling properties of stimulated wild type and mutant clrs using cgrp or modified receptor active peptide ligands
cgrp-f <dig> is hypothesized to be an important binding contact for hydrophobic n-terminus residues on the clr. however, it is important to show if this ligand-receptor contact is also central to activation mechanisms of the mature membrane protein. neuropeptide activation of endogenously expressed clr-ramp <dig> heterodimers has been shown to generate increases in camp  <cit> . therefore, we examined the characteristics of cgrp and other modified peptide agonists to generate camp in hek293t-ramp <dig> cells that had been transiently transfected with wild type and leucine clr mutations in order to test the importance of these residues for receptor activation. preliminary studies using non-transfected hek293t-ramp <dig> cells or cells transiently transfected with empty vector showed no production of camp after  <dig> min incubation at 37°c with  <dig> nm cgrp . conversely, increasing concentrations of cgrp generated rising amounts of camp in hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently expressing wild type or mutant clrs . the potency of cgrp to generate camp in these cells transfected with the wild type receptor  was not significantly different from hek293t-ramp <dig> cells expressing the l24a , l34a  or double l24a,l34a  clr mutants. this suggests that modification of these n-terminus clr leucines to alanine, individually or in tandem, does not affect the neuropeptide initiated signaling of the membrane protein.

to support functional results observed for cgrp mediated generation of camp through wild type and clr mutants, we used the truncated peptide, cgrp, which lacked f <dig> but was still amidated at the c-terminus. increasing amounts of cgrp was able to generate camp in hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently expressing the wild type clr in a concentration-dependent manner  the ec <dig> of cgrp for the expressed wild type clr-ramp <dig> heterodimer was calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm . although the cgrp maximal response was similar, this ec <dig> was over  <dig> -fold less than the value calculated for cgrp, indicating the importance of the peptide c-terminus f <dig> for receptor docking. furthermore, increasing amounts of cgrp were also used on hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently transfected with l24a, l34a or the l24a,l34a clr double mutant . potency values of cgrp to generated camp in these transfected cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm , respectively . these cgrp ec <dig> values for leucine clr mutants were no different when compared to the potency of this modified ligand for increasing camp through the wild type receptor. moreover, preincubation with 1μm of the cgrp receptor antagonist, cgrp, abolished the activity of 10μm cgrp to generate camp through the wild type and leucine clr mutants, indicating that this response was receptor specific .

to substantiate results using cgrp, we characterized another truncated cgrp receptor active peptide, cgrp, which still lacked a c-terminal phenylalanine. increasing amounts of cgrp were able to generate increasing amounts of camp in hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently expressing the wild type clr in a concentration-dependent manner . the ec <dig> of cgrp for the expressed wild type cgrp receptor was calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm . this ec <dig> value was similar to the potency of cgrp, but was considerably less than the calculated value of cgrp for the wild type receptor. this potency loss substantiates previous findings that illustrate the importance of this c-terminal cgrp-f <dig> for receptor docking. furthermore, the maximal response initiated by cgrp was appreciably less when compared to amounts of camp generated by activating the wild type receptor using cgrp or the endogenous neuropeptide. this finding points to the contribution of peptide residues linking the c-terminal operative domains of cgrp for receptor agonism. similarly, increasing amounts of cgrp were also used on hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently transfected with l24a, l34a or the l24a,l34a clr double mutant . potency values of cgrp to generated camp in these transfected cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm , respectively . ec <dig> values of cgrp for these leucine mutants are no different when compared to the potency of this modified ligand to increase camp through the expressed wild type receptor. the consistent loss of potency for cgrp receptor active ligands lacking a c-terminal phenylalanine compared to the endogenous peptide support previous findings that highlight the importance of cgrp-f <dig> for docking but not activating the mature receptor and suggests that crl residues l <dig> and l <dig> maybe required for this ligand-receptor interaction.

discussion
in this study we hypothesized that specific hydrophobic amino acids from a previously characterized n-terminal clr deletion mutation  <cit>  are important binding contacts for the c-terminus phenylalaninamide of the endogenous neuropeptide. this premise is based upon earlier structure-function investigations that divided cgrp into two distinct domains based upon its binding and agonistic properties for the endogenous receptor  <cit> . initial screening of all hydrophobic residues in this n-terminal domain of the clr revealed that two leucine residues , when mutated to alanine, demonstrated a significant binding affinity loss of cgrp, cgrp or accgrp for these specific clr mutants when compared to the wild type receptor . differences in the magnitude of binding loss between cgrp and accgrp for the wild type versus mutant clrs can be attributed to the interaction of cgrp residues 8– <dig>  which have been shown to also contribute towards the high affinity binding value of the ligand-receptor interaction  <cit> . moreover, there were no additional changes in the binding deficiency for cgrp, cgrp and accgrp when both leucine mutations were expressed in the same receptor protein, indicating that there is a cooperative but not synergistic relationship between these clr residues for binding cgrp-f <dig> ligands. additionally, the c-terminal phenylalaninamide is a shared residue between cgrp, cgrp and accgrp. therefore, compared to wild type clr, binding affinity losses of these peptide ligands for the leucine clr mutations suggests that l <dig> and l <dig> are significant binding contacts with cgrp-f <dig> 

to support this hypothesis, we examined the binding properties of truncated cgrp ligands lacking the c-terminal phenylalanine for the wild type and leucine clr mutations. there was a significant binding affinity loss of cgrp or cgrp when compared to the endogenous neuropeptide for the wild type clr. these differences were not just due to modifications of functional groups at the carboxyl end because cgrp was synthesized with an amidated c-terminus. furthermore, this dissimilarity between cgrp and cgrp was not due to configuration variations because previous biophysical measurements using circular dichroism spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance have demonstrated no significant differences in the secondary structure of these peptides  <cit> . this deficiency in binding affinity can be directly related to loss of the c-terminal phenylalanine, as has been described by others  <cit> . however, this affinity loss was no different from wild type receptor when cgrp or cgrp were used to compete for specific l24a, l34a or l24a,l34a mutant clr binding sites on transiently transfected hek293t-ramp <dig> cells. no changes in the binding parameters of these truncated c-terminus cgrp ligands for mutant or wild type clrs indicates that similar contacts for peptide docking are shared between these membrane proteins. this is contrasted with binding affinity differences of cgrp ligands having a c-terminal phenylalaninamide for leucine clr mutations versus wild type receptor. the only variation between these two sets of experiments is the c-terminus phenylalanine found on the endogenous neuropeptide. this binding property difference of truncated c-terminus peptide ligands versus cgrp for leucine mutants and wild type receptor proteins, strongly advocates clr l <dig> and l <dig> as important binding contacts for cgrp-f <dig>  moreover, this is the first description for identifiable binding contacts on the clr that specifically interacts with this essential neuropeptide phenylalaninamide.

we also assessed the functionality of these leucine clr mutants to increase the cgrp mediated production of camp in an effort to understand the importance of these receptor residues for agonist-dependent activation. when compared to wild type receptor the potency of cgrp to increase camp production was no different for all three clr leucine mutations . this is contrary to the 6- to 8-fold loss of cgrp binding affinity for these same clr mutations. the ability of cgrp to activate both mutant and wild type receptors with similar potencies suggests there is some plasticity in the agonist binding pocket that can overcome variations in how the peptide docks with the receptor. as figure  <dig> illustrates, changes in docking the c-terminal portion of cgrp  to these leucine clr mutants, may alter presentation of the n-terminus cgrp domain to the agonist binding pocket of the mature receptor. however, no changes in the potency of cgrp for the clr mutants versus wild type receptor indicates there is some flexibility of the clr agonist binding pocket that can overcome modified docking arrangements of the neuropeptide. moreover, this explanation for changes in cgrp binding affinity with no differences in potency for mutant versus wild type clr supports the concept of two distinct neuropeptide domains responsible for receptor binding and agonism  <cit> .

to validate this concept, we tested the ability of truncated c-terminal cgrp ligands to increase generation of camp in hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently expressing wild type and leucine clr mutations. if these modified cgrp ligands still retain the essential agonist structures needed for receptor activation, then a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of camp generated should be observed even though a necessary amino acid for ligand-receptor docking is missing. for both cgrp or cgrp there was a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of camp produced from hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently expressing the wild type clr . however, the potency of these modified ligands was significantly less when compared to cgrp mediated production of camp from the same wild type receptor, which is directly related to loss of the phenylalaninamide. these results are similar to investigations where cgrp was used for activating endogenous cgrp receptors on acutely isolated pancreatic acinar cells, to increase amylase release  <cit> . conversely, there was no significant potency differences of cgrp or cgrp for increasing camp in hek293t-ramp <dig> cells transiently expressing any of the leucine clr mutations when compared to wild type receptor . in addition, this increased camp production was specific for activating wild type or mutant clrs because the response was blocked to basal levels using an effective concentration of the receptor antagonist, cgrp. the considerable binding affinity loss of truncated c-terminal cgrp ligands for wild type or mutant clrs, while still being able to activate these same membrane proteins, validates the concept put forth in this study and by others for two distinct peptide ligand domains that manage docking and agonism of the endogenous neuropeptide  <cit> .

compared to wild type receptor, 8- to 20-fold differences in ki values of these leucine clr mutants for cgrp and accgrp are not as extensive when contrasted to affinity changes of cgrp and cgrp for the wild type receptor . absence of these leucine clr residues cannot explain the entire binding affinity loss of cgrp for the wild type receptor. consequently, it is reasonable to assume that interactions of cgrp-f <dig> with the mature clr-ramp <dig> heterodimer would necessitate a more complex relationship in order to account for the high affinity binding associated with the loss of this c-terminal peptide residue. for example, the non-peptide cgrp receptor antagonist, bibn4096bs, has been shown to exhibit high affinity for the endogenous cgrp receptor expressed on sk-n-mc human neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . in addition, this small molecule cgrp receptor antagonist can selectively be displaced in competition binding assays by cgrp and the receptor antagonist, cgrp  <cit> . moreover, site-directed mutagenesis studies have documented the importance of a specific extracellular ramp <dig> residue in determining bibn4096bs antagonist affinity for the mature cgrp receptor complex  <cit> . these observations not only indicate the specificity of bibn4096bs for the mature clr-ramp <dig> heterodimer but suggest that important high-affinity binding contacts on the mature receptor complex maybe common between bibn4096bs and cgrp. therefore, it is plausible that the complex high-affinity receptor binding contacts for cgrp-f <dig> include not only leucine  <dig> and  <dig> on the n-terminal domain of the clr, but also extracellular residues of ramp <dig> 

to address this idea, a minimized molecular model of a  <dig> amino acid clr n-terminal domain fragment interacting with cgrp-f <dig> is put forward in figure  <dig>  the α-helical structure of this receptor fragment puts l <dig> on the opposite side of the helix from l <dig>  we believe this minimized secondary structure to be valid because a net negative charge is aligned with a specific face of this α-helix, adjacent to l <dig>  interestingly, this same n-terminal receptor domain has recently been demonstrated to mediate structural interactions with ramp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, examination of the ramp <dig> extracellular sequence reveals a string of positively charged amino acids adjoining a non-polar hydrophobic region of this accessory protein. we propose that l <dig> and the adjacent negatively charged helical face of the clr n-terminus domain interacts with this extracellular region of ramp <dig> to form a complex high affinity binding pocket that includes l <dig> of the receptor. docking of cgrp-f <dig> would be accommodated by clr l <dig> and other residues formed by the l <dig> clr-ramp <dig> high affinity binding pocket. a deficiency of either clr l <dig> or l <dig> would cooperatively alter this high affinity binding pocket leading to loss of binding affinity for any cgrp receptor active ligand that contained a c-terminus phenylalaninamide.

in summary, we have characterized specific leucine residues on the clr membrane protein that participate in the high affinity cgrp binding mediated by the c-terminal phenylalaninamide of the neuropeptide. these clr leucine residues do not directly participate in cgrp mediated receptor activation because they are not interacting with residues identified with the "agonist" domain of the peptide ligand. alteration of either leucine clr residue accounts for a significant loss of cgrp affinity. in addition, this cgrp affinity loss is no different when both leucines are modified in the same receptor protein, indicating that there is not a synergistic relationship between these clr residues for cgrp binding. this paradigm for distinct binding and activation domains on cgrp for the mature receptor, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  has also been shown using biophysical measurements of the binding mechanism for another group b gpcr  <cit> . although lacking the potential binding contributions of ramp <dig>  which are currently being investigated, this study is the first description of identifiable clr residues important for docking cgrp to the receptor and will be useful in future studies that would build on our knowledge of this molecular relationship.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to describe specific amino acids on the clr n-terminus domain postulated to selectively interact with the c-terminal phenylalaninamide of cgrp, previously shown to impart the high affinity relationship of the neuropeptide with the mature cgrp receptor. this deduction is centered upon pharmacological properties of site-directed clr mutations that are analogous to previous structure-function properties of the endogenous neuropeptide. based on results from this study, a fundamental model of cgrp interaction with these n-terminus clr leucine residues is brought forward. this molecular model serves as a starting point for future studies that examine the relationship of the clr in forming a critical high affinity binding pocket with ramp <dig> for cgrp. our increased knowledge of the mature cgrp receptor binding pocket could lead to development of selective non-peptide small molecule ligands that would be useful in dissecting the important physiology of this abundant neuropeptide correlated with the pathological mechanisms for many vascular related diseases.
