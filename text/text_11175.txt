BACKGROUND
understanding the mechanisms by which natural selection shapes the evolution of genes is one of the major aims of molecular evolution. one commonly used approach for the detection of positive selection in protein-coding sequences is based on comparing the frequency of non-synonymous or amino-acid  changes to the frequency of synonymous  changes  <cit> . for simplicity, synonymous nucleotide changes that do not affect the protein are generally assumed to be neutral. in the absence of selection and accounting for the genetic code, we expect both types of changes to be equally probable so that the rate of non-synonymous substitutions per site  is equal to the rate of synonymous substitutions per site ; a ratio of k
a
/k
s
> <dig> indicates positive selection favouring a change in the protein  <cit> . however, this test is heavily conservative as proteins are generally under negative selection against amino acid changes that may affect protein function. positive selection at a small number of sites may be masked by negative selection removing non-synonymous changes in the rest of the protein  <cit> .

the mcdonald-kreitman  test  <cit>  attempts to account for the presence of negatively selected sites by comparing k
a
/k
s
 to f, the proportion of nearly neutral sites in the sequence  <cit> . if selection is strong, deleterious and beneficial mutations are expected to make little contribution to polymorphism; deleterious mutations are removed by selection and beneficial mutations reach fixation rapidly. polymorphic sites are expected to consist largely of neutral variation, and the ratio of the number of neutral non-synonymous polymorphic sites  to the number of synonymous polymorphic sites  can be used as an estimator of f <cit> . in the mk test, positive selection is inferred when k

 measured in a related sample can be used as a measure of selective constraint so that an increase in the k

 ratio implies positive selection  <cit> .

with the increasing availability of sequence data, various modifications of k

 methods have been developed to quantify the prevalence  <cit> , strength  <cit>  and dynamics of positive selection  <cit> . these methods rely on the assumption that sites segregate independently; that is, the change in frequency at one site will not affect the change in frequency at another site. in a large population with a high mutation rate, however, multiple mutations co-occur in the population and the change in frequency of one mutation also depends on selection acting at linked sites. depending on the type of selection, linkage can have different effects; background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference can both increase or decrease fixation probability or polymorphism frequency relative to expected levels, which we describe below.

background selection is the reduction in genetic variability caused by linkage to negatively selected sites  <cit> . the effect of background selection on the probability of fixation is qualitatively similar to a reduction in effective population size  <cit> , which implies a higher than expected value of k

 under positive selection relative to expectations under independently segregating sites  <cit> . background selection also reduces the number of neutral polymorphic sites  <cit> , and can result in a non-monotonic site-frequency spectrum, similar to the effect of continual adaptation  <cit> . linkage between sites introduces dependencies in the site frequency spectrum, increasing the covariance even if the mean is unchanged  <cit> . recent work with the structured coalescent  <cit>  in a model of only negative selection, provides analytical expressions for the number of both neutral and deleterious mutations showing that the effective population size varies, both going back in time, and between individuals in different fitness classes.

when both positive and negative selection operate on a locus, the dynamics of linked neutral and deleterious mutations will also be affected by hitch-hiking  <cit> . birky and walsh  <cit>  showed that hitch-hiking does not affect the fixation probability at neutral sites but increases the fixation probability at negatively selected sites, which implies that k
a
/k
s
 values are elevated relative to expectation under independently segregating sites. for the mk statistic, the effect of hitch-hiking depends on its effect on polymorphism relative to its effect on divergence. the effect of hitch-hiking on neutral polymorphism has been described by braverman et al.  <cit> , but has not been characterised on a selected background. previous findings  <cit>  were largely based on coalescent simulations which allow only a small number of sites to be under selection and model the trajectory of beneficial mutations deterministically. forward simulation studies  <cit>  which begin with a number of positively selected sites and evolve towards mutation-selection equilibrium show that linkage affects a number of frequency-based statistics including tajima’s d and heterozygosity.

clonal interference  has also been predicted to reduce the fixation probability of beneficial mutations and promote the fixation of deleterious mutations; this was demonstrated in several experimental systems  <cit> . more recently, theoretical models assuming continual adaptation with a high supply of beneficial mutations have been used to obtain analytical expressions characterising genetic diversity. these models predict a non-monotonic site frequency spectrum with a large number of both low and high-frequency mutations  <cit> . this is equivalent to large number of lineages coalescing simultaneously and is often described as multiple-mergers  <cit> .

here, we examine the joint effects of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference on the k
a
/k
s
 and mk statistic. based on theoretical studies  <cit> , we expect different forms of distortion in the site-frequency spectrum due to these effects. previous simulation studies  <cit>  have often considered these effects together, but here we distinguish between them by allowing both the strength of selection and the level of interference to vary. we do this using forward simulations with finite sites, allowing positive selection to occur at different times. finally, we propose three diagnostic statistics to indicate the degree to which  hitch-hiking of deleterious mutations  background selection and  clonal interference affect a sample of protein-coding sequences.

RESULTS
the effect of background selection
we begin by examining the effect of negative selection and linkage without positive selection in a protein-coding region of  <dig> codons evolving under a wright-fisher process. negative selection is described by the distribution of fitness effects  of non-synonymous changes, which are specific to each codon site. the dfe is modelled using a gamma distribution where a large value of the shape parameter β corresponds to a higher proportion of weakly deleterious mutations.

the effect of background selection on the ω^=ka/ks statistic is shown in figure  <dig>  the density of estimators with linked selection computed using equation  is shown in solid lines, whereas the corresponding values obtained with independently segregating sites from prf simulations are shown with dashed lines. both simulations account for the contribution of segregating polymorphisms. the effect of linkage, therefore, is shown by the difference between simulations with linkage and without linkage. as expected, the effect of background selection in reducing ω^ increases with β and u. our simulations also show that linkage increases the variance of the estimator due to correlations between linked sites. this is particularly evident for u=10− <dig> where the distribution of ω^ visibly broadens with increasing β.

in figure  <dig>  we consider three forms of the mk statistic:  the uncorrected estimator âmk, and  fay’s corrected estimator âf  which removes low-frequency polymorphisms to reduce the effect of segregating deleterious polymorphisms and  bhatt’s corrected estimator âb which removes both low and high frequency polymorphisms that are likely to contain deleterious and beneficial mutations. in the absence of positive selection, we expect âf and âb to perform similarly, and this is indeed seen for u=10
−6
. however, for simulations with a higher mutation rate and correspondingly larger effect of background selection, discrepancies occur between the two statistics due to an increase in the number of high-frequency polymorphisms. unlike ω^, the variance of the mk statistics does not seem to be affected by linkage. in fact the performance of the mk statistics  is slightly improved by background selection which removes weakly deleterious mutations.

the combined effect of background selection, clonal interference and hitch-hiking
in the following section, we examine the combined effect of negative and positive selection. positive selection is introduced at a fixed number of sites at intervals of τ generations throughout the simulation, where all positively selected sites have the same selective coefficient s
b
. decreasing τ increases the probability of interfering positive sweeps. a comparison of the effects of different selective conditions on the site frequency spectrum is shown in figure  <dig>  note that these curves represent averaged levels of polymorphisms, and dynamics can vary rapidly over time .

we show results for low levels of background selection  in the left column and results for high levels of background selection in the right column. the  synonymous site frequency spectrum is shown in the top row. when the effect of background selection is small, the synonymous site frequency spectrum is close to the expectation under independently segregating sites . background selection  reduces the level of synonymous variation, particularly at medium frequencies, leading to a non-monotonic distribution, but the effect is not as severe as clonal interference. linked positive selection further reduces polymorphism levels; a slow rate of sweeps with strong selection  primarily affects high-frequency mutations while a high supply of weak positive selection  results in smaller levels of reduction at both low and high frequencies. when both the supply rate and the strength of positive selection is strong , the synonymous site frequency spectrum approaches θ/i <dig>  which is the leading behaviour predicted for continual adaptation  <cit> .

to examine how linkage affects selected mutations, we compare the ratio of the averaged frequency spectra for non-synonymous  and synonymous  sites . the a/s ratio in the absence of positive selection is indicated by the bold grey line, whereas the a/s ratio for deleterious sites linked to positively selected sites is shown by coloured solid lines. the discrepancy between the grey and coloured lines reflects the effect of hitch-hiking; there is a slight increase in the a/s ratio at high-frequencies due to hitch-hiking. note that the actual number of deleterious polymorphisms is reduced relative to simulations with no positive selection  but the number of synonymous polymorphisms is reduced by a relatively greater proportion.

comparing the a/s ratio with  and without  beneficial mutations, it can be seen that beneficial mutations can segregate at all frequencies when the supply rate is high , but mutations segregating at high frequencies tend to include more beneficial mutations. comparison of the two panels in the bottom row also shows that higher levels of background selection increase the effect of both hitch-hiking  and clonal interference , as distortions in the site-frequency spectrum tend to occur over a wider range of frequencies. similar results are seen for larger values of β with more pronounced reductions of synonymous polymorphism due to background selection, and changes in the a/s ratio due to hitch-hiking and clonal interference are spread across a broader frequency range .

the contributions of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference result in qualitatively different behaviour in the site-frequency spectrum, and this in turn causes characteristic types of bias in the various forms of the mk statistic. this is summarised in figure  <dig>  where we compare the performance of different forms of the mk statistic in estimating the true number of beneficial mutations in each simulation. here, we do not consider the uncorrected âmk as it was severely biased in all the simulations we examined. an additional mk statistic, âd is considered which uses divergence information from simulations with no positive selection instead of estimating selective constraint from polymorphism information. comparison of âf or âb against âd, therefore, shows how much of the bias is due to incorrect estimation of selective constraint.

the different panels in figure  <dig> correspond to different combinations of positive and negative selection: low levels of background selection  and infrequent positive sweeps , low levels of background selection and frequent positive sweeps , high levels of background selection and infrequent positive sweeps  and high levels of background selection with frequent positive sweeps . when the effect of background selection is large , both âf and âb tend to underestimate the true number of adaptive substitutions. for low levels of background selection or frequent positive sweeps, the effect of hitch-hiking  and the amount of clonal interference  has a consistent effect on the mk statistics. for small values of β so that low levels of hitch-hiking occur, âb has smaller bias than âf. however, for high levels of hitch-hiking âf is less biased, particularly when clonal interference is low. results for different values of s
b
were qualitatively similar but with larger relative error for weaker positive selection.

the reason for these biases is intuitively clear from the site frequency spectrum. âb differs from âf only in that it does not use polymorphism data at high frequency. therefore, âb is more robust against clonal interference  as beneficial mutations are more likely to segregate at high frequencies. however, when weakly deleterious effects are prevalent , âb is upwardly biased as it does not account for the relaxation of selective constraint due to positive selection. this is confirmed by the similar values obtained for âb and âd, suggesting that removal of high and low frequency polymorphisms in the context of linked selection has a similar effect to that expected under independently segregating sites, namely the removal of both positively and negatively selected mutations. the correction of bhatt et al.  <cit>  does not perform well when there are high levels of background selection as distortions in the site frequency spectrum are spread across a wider range of frequencies than without background selection.

diagnostics for linkage effects
in the previous section, we showed that much of the bias in the comparative estimators can be explained in terms of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference. in order to detect these effects using samples of protein-coding sequences, we construct and examine three diagnostic statistics.

the first diagnostic tests for an excess of low frequency non-synonymous polymorphisms relative to medium frequency polymorphisms. for a sample size of n, we consider a mutation to occur at low frequency if it occurs i times in the sample, where i belongs to the set il={ <dig> ,…,−1} and square brackets indicate rounding to the nearest integer. charlesworth and eyre-walker  <cit>  showed that the majority of deleterious polymorphisms occurred in this frequency range even when the sample size is varied. similarly, we consider a mutation to occur at medium frequencies if the number of times it occurs in the sample belongs to im={,+ <dig> …,}. the first diagnostic is given by

  d1=∑i∈ilpa∑i∈ilps+1−∑i∈impa∑i∈imps+ <dig>  

if weak deleterious effects are rare, then we expect that most deleterious mutations are immediately removed from the population. in this case, most polymorphisms would be selectively neutral and we would expect that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms, at any frequency range, is simply determined by the mutational bias. the difference of the two ratios in d1is therefore expected to equal zero in the absence of weak deleterious effects and large values are indicative of a high frequency of weak deleterious mutations, which results in susceptibility to hitch-hiking.

in figure  <dig>  we show the correlation between d1and the amount of hitch-hiking, which we measure as the relative excess of non-synonymous substitutions at non-beneficial sites in simulations with positive selection compared to simulations with no positive selection. a value of  <dig>  in the x-axis corresponds to half of all non-synonymous substitutions being due to hitch-hiking. when positive selection is weak so that âb< <dig> , d1correlates with the β shape parameter so that values of d1> <dig> indicate susceptibility to hitch-hiking. when strong positive selection occurs, selective constraint is reduced so that the proportion of mutations that can be considered weakly deleterious may be increased. in this case, we see that d1is also increased, even for small values of β. interpretation of the d1statistic, therefore, should depend on both the value of d1and the mk statistic. we use âb here as figure  <dig> indicates that it is less likely to result in underestimation than âf.

the second diagnostic tests for an excess of high frequency polymorphisms which is an indication of multiple merger events  <cit>  due to interfering mutations that can be either negatively  or positively selected. we compare the number of high frequency polymorphisms to medium frequency polymorphisms, where a mutation is defined to be at high frequency if the number of times it occurs in the sample belongs to ih={+ <dig> …,n−1} and |x| denotes the number of elements in the set x,

  d2=∑i∈imipaim−∑i∈ihipaih. 

deleterious mutations are not expected to persist to medium frequencies, so polymorphisms at medium and high frequencies can be assumed to be neutral or beneficial. under assumptions of neutrality and independently segregating sites, the expected number of polymorphic sites that occur at frequency i is given by e)=θ
a
/i, where θ
a
=2unlc/, giving an expectation of d2= <dig>  values of d2< <dig> can, therefore, indicate strong linkage effects due to an excess of beneficial or deleterious mutations.

a third statistic can distinguish between the effect of background selection and clonal interference,

  d3=2∑i∈ihipaih−∑i∈imipaim−∑i∈ihipsih×∑i=1n−1pa∑i=1n−1ps+ <dig>  

this statistic tests for an excess of high-frequency non-synonymous polymorphisms relative to both medium frequency non-synonymous polymorphisms and high-frequency synonymous polymorphisms. as with d1and d <dig>  the expectation under independently segregating neutral sites is d3= <dig> and values of d3> <dig> are indicative of clonal interference. in figure  <dig>  values of d2and d3are shown for varying levels of background selection and clonal interference. in the left panel, low mutation rates generate only low levels of background selection and values of d2and d3are strongly correlated, as both are due to clonal interference. in the right panel, a high mutation rate increases levels of both background selection and clonal interference. simulations with a high supply rate of beneficial mutations  have large values of d3and strongly negative d2values, whereas simulations with a low supply rate of beneficial mutations and occasional instances of clonal interference tend to small positive values of d3with negative values of d <dig>  when only high levels of background selection are acting, both d3and d2fall below zero . the behaviour of these three diagnostics are similar for different sample sizes  and different population sizes .

in figure  <dig>  we show that the bias of âf and âb varies systematically with d <dig> and d <dig>  larger values of d1and d <dig> tend to result in larger values for both statistics; for âf this tends to reduce the magnitude of the bias, but increases bias for âb. this suggests that âf performs better for large d1but âbperforms better for large d3and small d <dig>  the size of the bias for both statistics is larger for higher mutations rates  which corresponds to very large d2values  and larger effects of background selection. in particular, when d3< <dig> and d2≪ <dig>  both statistics are expected to heavily underestimate the amount of positive selection that has occurred.

to evaluate whether d <dig>  d2and d3differ from zero, we use a non-parametric bootstrap, recalculating statistics after resampling with replacement from the original sequence sample. the scaling factor for mutation bias c, which is omitted from d <dig>  is automatically accounted for by this method. confidence intervals for d1were constructed from the bootstraps using the  <dig>  to  <dig>  percentiles. as d2is slightly biased, confidence intervals for d2and d3were constructed using the bca method provided in r  <cit> .

application of diagnostics to human influenza a 
we applied the diagnostics with the bootstrap method to the human influenza a  dataset used by strelkowa and lässig  <cit> . the dataset comprises  <dig> sequences with a length of  <dig> codons spanning 1968– <dig>  the list of accession numbers is provided in the additional file  <dig> in  <cit> . following strelkowa and lässig  <cit> , we used a/bilthoven/16190/ <dig> as the ancestral sequence; results using a/hong kong/1/ <dig> were very similar. diagnostics d1and d2were computed for samples in each year separately, with sample sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the results are shown in figure  <dig>  there is some variation over time, with wider confidence intervals in the earlier samples due to small sample sizes, but d1values are mostly centred around zero, suggesting low levels of hitch-hiking. hitch-hiking cannot be conclusively ruled out as confidence intervals are quite wide and a number of points reach d1= <dig>  however, values of d1remain consistently low with a number of time points falling below zero which is more consistent with a low hitch-hiking scenario. in contrast, simulations with prevalent hitch-hiking tend to to have confidence intervals that are consistently above zero and point estimates much higher than  <dig>  . values of d2are strongly negative, indicating a strong effect due to interfering deleterious or beneficial mutations; the magnitude of d2is consistent with a high level of background selection. multiple time points with d3≫ <dig> also suggests that clonal interference frequently occurs in the evolution of h3n <dig> 

discussion
it has long been known that linkage influences polymorphism frequencies and fixation probabilities which can adversely affect methods that assume independent segregation of sites. the mk statistic, which compares the number of polymorphic sites rather than using only frequency information, is generally considered to be more robust to linkage effects than frequency-based statistics  <cit> . in this study, we show that the mk statistic can be affected, depending on the mode of linked selection and its characteristic effect of the site-frequency spectrum.

when background selection has a large effect, distortions in the site-frequency spectrum result in a downward bias in the mk statistics. however, when the effect of negative selection is low compared to positive selection, the performance of the mk statistics as a quantitative estimator of the number of adaptive substitutions is determined by the extent of hitch-hiking and clonal interference. when negative selection is strong so that levels of hitch-hiking are low, âb tends to perform better. specifically, it is more robust against distortions of the site frequency spectrum at high frequencies caused by background selection or clonal interference. however, âf is more robust to hitch-hiking which occurs when weak negative selection is pervasive.

our results are consistent with that of a recent study by messer and petrov  <cit>  showing that âf

tends to underestimate the number of adaptive substitutions. we find this primarily occurs when background selection has a large effect and positive selection is infrequent. however, when positive selection is strong, hitch-hiking can also lead to overestimation as suggested in some empirical studies  <cit> . when interactions between deleterious polymorphisms dominate the dynamics of the populations, the asymptotic correction proposed by messer and petrov  <cit>  can be used to correct for underestimation due to low and medium frequency deleterious polymorphisms. this method corrects for deleterious mutations, as the relative abundance of deleterious mutations is reduced at higher frequencies, but cannot be applied for beneficial mutations which have increased relative abundance at higher frequencies.

here, we show that, when background selection is relatively weak, choosing the appropriate form of the mk statistic can reduce estimation bias. messer and petrov’s  <cit>  results apply for organisms with large genomes and many weakly deleterious mutations, but when genomes are small and selective effects are broadly distributed, as is the case viral populations  <cit> , the considerations raised in this study apply.

understanding the effects of linked selection also affects our interpretation of these estimators. the number of adaptive substitutions cannot be directly related to either the strength of selection or the supply of beneficial mutations, but it is a combination of both of these factors. for example, strelkowa and lässig  <cit>  and koelle et al.  <cit>  raised alternative hypotheses concerning whether periodic positive sweeps in human influenza were due to a limiting supply of beneficial mutations, or by a high supply rate with competition between beneficial mutations limiting the fixation rate.

the selective regime is important, then, for both the application and interpretation of these estimators. we present three statistics for evaluating the effects of linked selection. d1signals the presence of weak deleterious mutations that can potentially cause hitch-hiking and is based on identifying an excess of non-synonymous low-frequency polymorphisms. more sophisticated methods to characterise the dfe have been used  <cit> , but these methods rely on a number of assumptions and have given conflicting results. consequently, it is useful to have a simple diagnostic that flags when hitch-hiking might be an issue. we have not attempted to use standard site-frequency based indicators of hitch-hiking  which test for an excess of low and high frequency polymorphisms. as demonstrated by kim  <cit> , the excess of high frequency polymorphisms may not occur in recurrent sweeps. in addition, this effect can be complicated by clonal interference. if no comparative information is available, the excess of low frequency polymorphisms cannot be distinguished from a model of population growth  <cit> .

our second diagnostic, d2detects an excess of high-frequency non-synonymous polymorphisms signalling strong linkage effects on the population, either due to a large number of deleterious mutations causing background selection, or a large number of beneficial mutations causing clonal interference. in both cases, mk statistics are biased and estimators assuming independently segregating sites must be interpreted with care. we can distinguish between the effects of background selection and clonal interference by using a third statistic, d <dig>  the diagnostic for clonal interference presented here follow a similar reasoning to the method used by strelkowa and lässig  <cit>  in testing for an excess of high frequency non-synonymous polymorphisms. our method has more general applicability as it accounts for the effect of deleterious mutations, and can be used even when it is not known which region of the sequence is positively selected.

we have applied these diagnostics to the dataset used by strelkowa and lässig  <cit> . our results provide further support for their conclusion that clonal interference occurs in human influenza a. the authors also raised the question of whether strong and frequent positive selection would promote the fixation of deleterious mutations, increasing the brittleness of the protein. the values obtained for d <dig>  however, suggest that strong negative selection is predominant, so that hitch-hiking in the ha <dig> region is rare; this is in agreement with shih et al.  <cit> , who showed that few non-synonymous substitutions occurred outside antigenic epitopes. it is also consistent with a phylogenetic study by nielsen and yang  <cit>  that estimated the dfe shape parameter β in that region as  <dig> , indicative of low sensitivity to hitch-hiking in our model. the combination of clonal interference and robustness against hitch-hiking suggests that the modification used by bhatt et al.  <cit>  is appropriate for application to the ha <dig> region.

in this study, we have not considered the effect of population size changes, which are known to affect site-frequency based statistics. however, we expect d1and d3to be relatively robust, as they are based on comparisons between the non-synonymous and synonymous site frequency spectra  <cit> . population expansions, which are expected to have the strongest effect on low-frequency mutations  <cit> , should have minimal effect on d2and d <dig>  population bottlenecks, however, can remove medium frequency polymorphisms, potentially elevating the magnitude of both d2and d3and giving false positives for clonal interference. we have also not examined the effect of selection against synonymous mutations. we expect, however, that d1and d3should not be strongly affected as long as selection against synonymous mutations is weaker than against non-synonymous mutations. d2does not use information from the synonymous site frequency spectra and should not be affected by selection against synonymous mutations, but negative values of d2may also result from background selection at synonymous sites. these effects could be considered in more detail in future simulation studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that linked selection is responsible for biases in the mk statistics, causing underestimation when there are high levels of interference between selected mutations, and overestimation for strong non-interfering sweeps. the statistics presented in this study can be applied to samples of protein-coding sequences to evaluate the influence of linked selection for the parameter range studied here. values of d1that are significantly greater than zero signal susceptibility to hitch-hiking while values of d2significantly smaller than zero indicate the occurrence of multiple mergers. multiple mergers due to clonal interference can be distinguished from background selection when d3> <dig> 

based on our simulations, when d2< <dig>  d3> <dig> and d1≈ <dig>  we recommend using a statistic such as âb, which excludes both low- and high-frequency polymorphisms. on the the hand, when high values of d <dig> are obtained, it is more appropriate to use âf which uses medium and high-frequency polymorphisms, accounting for change in selective constraint due to hitchhiking. in cases where d2≪ <dig> and d3<= <dig>  both âf and âb are expected to perform poorly.
