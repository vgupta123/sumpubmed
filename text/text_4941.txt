BACKGROUND
pertussis toxin  is a complex exotoxin and an important virulence factor produced by bordetella pertussis, a bacterial pathogen of the human respiratory tract that causes the disease whooping cough. pt holotoxin is a multi-subunit complex with an ab <dig> structure  <cit> : the enzymatically active a subunit  is an adp-ribosyltransferase that modifies the alpha subunit of several heterotrimeric g proteins  in mammalian cells  <cit> , and the b oligomer  binds unidentified glycoconjugate receptors on cells  <cit> . the events in the intracellular trafficking of pt between surface binding and adp-ribosylation of target g proteins on the cytoplasmic side of cellular membranes are relatively obscure. electron microscopy studies and experiments with inhibitors suggest that the holotoxin is internalized by endocytosis  <cit> . subcellular fractionation experiments and inhibition of cytotoxicity by brefeldin a , which disrupts the golgi apparatus  <cit> , provide evidence for subsequent retrograde transport of pt to the golgi apparatus  <cit> . trafficking of pt beyond the golgi apparatus is relatively uncharacterized, though it has been hypothesized that further retrograde transport of pt through the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum  occurs  <cit> . after dissociation of s <dig> from the holotoxin, the liberated s <dig> subunit is then proposed to traverse the er membrane to gain access to its target g proteins in the cytosol  <cit> . evidence supporting this er-to-cytosol translocation was obtained from transfection studies with constructs expressing s <dig> with a signal peptide for er localization  <cit> .

another observation that may bear on the cell biology and cytotoxicity of pt is that the s <dig> subunit appears to be proteolytically processed to a lower molecular weight form upon interaction of pt with mammalian cells  <cit> . this processing was shown to be dependent upon entry of pt into cells and seemed to involve an early endosome function. the size of the processed form of s <dig>  suggested that processing may be targeted at a protease-sensitive loop near the c-terminus of s <dig> that contains primary sites for trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage  <cit> . however, evidence for the location of the cellular cleavage site on s <dig> was not presented. in addition, a link between processing of s <dig> and activity of pt in cells was not established. proteolytic processing is a common theme in the activation of bacterial toxins upon interaction with mammalian cells. for example, anthrax toxin, diphtheria toxin, pseudomonas exotoxin a and shiga toxin are all activated after cleavage by the endogenous eukaryotic protease furin  <cit> , a subtilisin-like protease residing in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells  <cit> , or by closely-related proteases  <cit> . cholera toxin  and escherichia coli heat-labile toxin  a subunits are cleaved at a protease-sensitive loop to promote maximal activity  <cit> , and ct a subunit was found to be cleaved upon interaction of ct with t <dig> epithelial cells, by an unidentified protease  <cit> .

in this study we extend the analysis of proteolytic processing of cell-associated s <dig> and conclude that s <dig> processing is not essential for the cellular activity of pt.

RESULTS
processing and fractionation of s <dig> in pt-treated cho cells
in a previous study, 125i-labelled pt was used for analysis of s <dig> processing in mammalian cells  <cit> . as an alternative to radiolabeled toxin, we analyzed detergent lysates of cells treated with unlabeled pt to determine whether we could detect s <dig> processing. near-confluent chinese hamster ovary  cells were treated with pt  for  <dig> h at 37°c, and then cells were washed, recovered by trypsinization and lysed on ice with either triton x- <dig> lysis buffer or ripa lysis buffer. the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were then analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and western blotting. as shown in fig. 1a, we were able to detect processing of s <dig> by this method, with the majority of cell-associated s <dig> present as the lower molecular weight form . this processing event was independent of pt enzymatic activity, since the enzymatically inactive pt-9k/129g  was similarly processed by cho cells . the kinetics of s <dig> processing  were very similar to those previously reported  <cit> , which, along with the similar size of the processed form, strongly suggested that we were observing the same event as previously studied. surprisingly, however, the great majority  of s <dig> fractionated with the detergent-insoluble pellet material in this assay. triton lysis at 25°c rather than on ice increased the proportion of s <dig> that was solubilized, but at least half of the processed form remained in the insoluble pellet material . to determine whether s <dig> fractionation with the detergent-insoluble material represented a potentially interesting feature of its intracellular transport, or merely an artifact of the lysis procedure, we added  <dig> ng pt to a triton lysate of untreated cho cells, incubated this on ice  <dig> min, centrifuged to separate the mix into soluble and insoluble fractions and analyzed these by sds-page and western blotting. almost all  of the s <dig> fractionated to the insoluble pellet , demonstrating that s <dig> association with detergent-insoluble material occurs in the lysate and is independent of pt transport within cells. the triton-insoluble fraction typically contains nuclei and cytoskeletal components  <cit> , so it is possible that pt, or at least s <dig>  has an affinity for one or more of these components.

effects of protease and cell trafficking inhibitors on s <dig> processing in cho cells
we first ruled out the possibility that furin, a protease that cleaves several other bacterial toxins in mammalian cells, is responsible for s <dig> cleavage, by finding that s <dig> processing occurs normally in furin-deficient fd <dig> cells  <cit>  . this observation was not surprising since there are no consensus furin cleavage sites in the s <dig> sequence. in order to determine the catalytic type of protease responsible for s <dig> processing in cho cells, we preincubated cho cells with serine, cysteine, aspartic and metalloprotease inhibitors  before addition of pt, and studied s <dig> processing by these cells as before . the broad specificity serine protease inhibitor  <dig> -dci did not significantly inhibit processing , and neither did the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin . the serine protease inhibitor pefabloc sc  did have a consistent inhibitory effect on s <dig> processing, with approximately 45% of the cell-associated s <dig> in the unprocessed form . since the other serine protease inhibitors had no effect on s <dig> processing, the reason for the inhibitory effect of pefabloc sc is unclear, but may be related to its ability to bind covalently to proteins . neither the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin nor the cysteine protease inhibitor e- <dig> had any significant inhibitory effect on s <dig> processing  . however, edta had a strong inhibitory effect on s <dig> processing by cho cells , with 56% and 74% of cell-associated s <dig> in the unprocessed form in the presence of  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm edta, respectively. since the inhibitory effect of a non-specific metal chelator such as edta could be due to the cation-dependence of activity of other proteases  <cit> , we also used the metalloprotease inhibitor  <dig> -phenanthroline, which has a high affinity for zinc and is considered the most useful inhibitor for metalloproteases  <cit> . this inhibitor also had a strong inhibitory effect on s <dig> processing by cho cells , with 61% and 63% of cell-associated s <dig> in the unprocessed form in the presence of  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm phenanthroline, respectively. therefore, we conclude that the cellular protease responsible for s <dig> processing in cho cells is most likely a metalloprotease, which presumably resides in the secretory  pathway and the identity of which remains to be determined. this is a novel observation in the sense that other bacterial toxins are cleaved by cellular proteases of the subtilisin family   <cit>  or by other serine proteases  <cit> , although one report demonstrated that ct activity on several different cell types was blocked by a competitive substrate for metalloproteases  <cit> , suggesting that metalloproteases may also be involved in the cellular activity of other bacterial toxins. however, the possibility remains that multiple proteases, possibly of different classes, are involved in this s <dig> processing event.

we also determined the inhibitory activity on s <dig> processing by cho cells of two inhibitors of cellular trafficking and secretion, bafilomycin a <dig>  which inhibits vacuolar proton atpase and therefore prevents endosome acidification  <cit> , and bfa, which disrupts the golgi apparatus  <cit> . bafilomycin a <dig> had a significant inhibitory effect on s <dig> processing, with 51% of cell-associated s <dig> in the unprocessed form , consistent with the hypothesis that s <dig> processing occurs in the endosomal compartment of cho cells and demonstrating a role for endosome acidification in this processing event. however, bfa had no inhibitory effect on s <dig> processing , consistent with previously reported results  <cit>  and with the hypothesis that s <dig> processing occurs prior to the golgi apparatus in the putative retrograde trafficking pathway.

effects of s <dig> processing inhibitors on cellular activity of pt
proteolytic processing of bacterial toxins is a common theme in their activation within mammalian cells  <cit> , but whether cellular processing of s <dig> plays a role in the activity of pt had not been previously addressed. as a preliminary investigation of this question, we sought to determine whether the inhibitors of s <dig> processing by cho cells had any effect on the ability of pt to adp-ribosylate target g proteins in cho cells. cho cells were preincubated with inhibitors before addition of pt  as before. controls were cells to which either pt or pt*  was added in the absence of inhibitor. cells were recovered after  <dig> h, and lysates were prepared and tested in the adp-ribosylation assay. in this assay, active pt within cells will adp-ribosylate available g proteins, so that when a lysate is prepared from these cells and used in an in vitro adp-ribosylation assay with pt and 32p-labelled nad, there is no labeling of g proteins in the lysate, since they were already modified by the pt added to the cells. if pt activity within cells is inhibited, then a proportion of the g proteins in the lysate from these cells will be unmodified and therefore labeled in the in vitro reaction with pt. the assay was repeated twice and the result of one experiment is shown in fig. 2c. the mean percent inhibition for the various inhibitors  was as follows: pefabloc sc – 95%, bfa – 79%, bafilomycin a <dig> – 49%, edta – 44%, phenanthroline – 28%,  <dig> -dci – 9%, pepstatin – 8%. therefore there was no strong correlation between the extent of inhibition of s <dig> processing by the inhibitors and their inhibitory activity on adp-ribosylation of g proteins by pt in cho cells. the cell trafficking/secretion inhibitors had a significant inhibitory effect , but the metalloprotease inhibitors had only a mild inhibitory effect. of the other protease inhibitors, pefabloc sc had the greatest inhibitory effect, as it did on s <dig> processing, whereas pepstatin had no significant inhibitory effect on adp-ribosylation . to rule out an effect of the inhibitors on the enzymatic activity of pt , we also performed in vitro adp-ribosylation assays with pt in the presence of the various inhibitors at the concentrations used on the cho cells. no significant inhibitory effect was seen with any of the inhibitors  with the exception of  <dig> -dci, which was also somewhat toxic to the cho cells but did not significantly inhibit processing of s <dig>  altogether, these data are inconclusive with regard to the hypothesis that cellular processing of s <dig> plays a role in the adp-ribosylation of g proteins in cho cells by pt.

location of processing site on s1
we reasoned that if we could identify the precise processing cleavage site on s <dig>  then we would be able to mutagenize this site, obtain a mutant form of s <dig> that was resistant to cellular processing, and then determine whether processing was required for cellular activity of pt. the size of s1p compared to unprocessed s <dig>  suggested a cleavage site close to either the n-terminus or the c-terminus of s <dig>  although processing at both termini was also a possibility. processing at the n-terminus of s <dig> seems unlikely in view of the fact that the arginine at amino acid  <dig>  is crucial to enzymatic activity  <cit> . a protease-sensitive loop that has primary sites for trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage  <cit>  is located towards the c-terminus of s <dig>   <cit> . to help define the location on s <dig> of processing by cho cells, we compared the cellular processing of a modified form of pt containing an extension of  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus of s <dig>  to that of native pt. as shown in fig. 4a, the processed form of s <dig> in cells incubated with pt*-csp/n was slightly larger  than that of cells incubated with pt, leading to the conclusion that processing occurs towards the c-terminus of s <dig>  the presence of  <dig> processed forms of s <dig> in cells incubated with pt*-csp/n presumably reflects some additional processing of the n-terminal extension, but since each of these forms is larger than that of s1p from native pt, the conclusion is the same. fig. 4b shows that the major trypsin-digested fragment of s <dig> is slightly larger than s1p from cellular processing of pt, suggesting that the site on s <dig> of cellular processing is close to the protease-sensitive loop, but is n-terminal to the trypsin cleavage site . however, we cannot rule out the possibility of intracellular modification of s <dig> that would alter its migration on sds-page gels and complicate the interpretation of this experiment.

we performed extensive site-specific mutagenesis in the region between m <dig> and r <dig> of s <dig> in an attempt to obtain a mutant form of pt that was no longer processed in mammalian cells. however, we were unable to obtain such a mutant by this approach – almost all pt mutants were processed normally, including those with changes at the primary cleavage sites for trypsin  and chymotrypsin  . certain changes at residue a <dig>  resulted in very low levels  of pt secretion by b. pertussis  so that we were unable to determine whether processing was affected. however, other changes at this residue  had no effect on pt secretion, processing or activity . in an attempt to locate the processing site, we constructed mutant forms of pt with deletions of various stretches of residues in this region. each of  <dig> adjacent deletions of  <dig> residues  resulted in the complete loss of s <dig> processing in cho cells , and the same was true of the overlapping  <dig> residue deletion Δ207– <dig> , strongly suggesting that the processing site is located in this region. however, smaller overlapping deletions of  <dig> or  <dig> residues in this region did not disrupt s <dig> processing , indicating that no particular sequence in this region served as a specific cleavage site for the processing event. in further support of this idea,  <dig> pt constructs in which residues 210– <dig> of s <dig> were replaced by random amino acid sequence  were both processed normally . equivalent replacement of residues 203– <dig> abrogated assembly and secretion of pt by b. pertussis, so we could not make the same assessment for this region. however, two lines of evidence suggested that the processing site may be located in the region of residue a <dig>  first, a pt construct  with an insertion of  <dig> amino acids between residues q <dig> and a <dig> in s <dig> was processed to the same size s1p as wild type pt , indicating that the processing site was upstream of the insertion . second, mass spectrometry analysis of the processed and unprocessed forms of s <dig> in lysates from pt-treated cho cells identified a difference in mass between s <dig> and s1p  most closely corresponding to the theoretical mass of a peptide from r <dig> to the c-terminus of s <dig>  . however, as mentioned above, substitutions at a <dig> either did not affect processing of s <dig> or greatly reduced secretion of pt, and substitutions at m <dig> and r <dig> also did not affect s <dig> processing , so we were unable to verify this putative cleavage site by mutagenesis. it is also possible that the major processing site is further downstream  with subsequent additional cleavage occurring during cell lysis, resulting in the apparent size of s1p.

effect of processing site mutations on pt activity
we determined the effect of several of these deletion and replacement mutations on pt activity using the adp-ribosylation assay. cells were incubated with the purified pt construct  for  <dig> h to determine cellular activity. as shown in fig. 6a, all mutant constructs retained significant activity, relative to the inactive mutant pt*. the two deletion mutants that were not processed in cells were analyzed further and were found to possess  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of wild type pt cellular activity . the in vitro activity of these constructs was also assayed, using a fusion of gst with the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of human giα <dig>  as the substrate, with the finding that the Δ203– <dig> mutant possessed 100% of wild type pt activity while the Δ211– <dig> mutant had a  <dig> % reduction in activity . we also found that the 210– <dig> replacement mutants retained full cellular activity . together these data demonstrate that s <dig> processing is not essential for pt cellular activity, since the mutants in which processing was apparently abolished retained significant activity. however, this conclusion must remain tentative in the absence of a single substitution mutant that is unprocessed, which would be the best reagent to answer this question. a large deletion of eight amino acid residues may affect other pt-associated properties or may mask the effects of the loss of processing. the stability of these mutant forms of pt may have been altered, though apparently not significantly reduced from the processing assay data . it is also possible that the number of pt molecules necessary for full activity is low enough to be undetectable in the processing western blot assay. in previous studies, limited trypsin cleavage of pt increased its activation in vitro  <cit> , indicating that s <dig> processing may play a role in activity, and domains on s <dig> for interaction with target proteins and enzymatic activity were found to lie within the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids  <cit> , so the processed form of s <dig> should retain these functions.

we also tested several strains expressing mutant pt constructs in our mouse infection model of b. pertussis virulence  <cit> , and none of these strains was significantly defective in colonization compared to the parental wild type strain . although these data suggest that s <dig> processing is not essential for the virulence of b. pertussis, it is possible that s <dig> could be processed in vivo by alternative proteases absent from cho cells.

processing in stable cho cell transfectants expressing s1
previously we constructed stable cho cell transfectants expressing s <dig> either with a signal peptide  or without one , and showed that s <dig> fully adp-ribosylated target g proteins in each transfectant  <cit> . in that study we did not observe significant processing of s <dig> in whole cell lysates of these transfectants, but we re-examined this issue using triton x- <dig> lysis of transfectants and western blotting of the insoluble pellet material. as seen in fig. 7a, there was no detectable processing of s <dig> to s1p in either transfectant. exogenous addition of pt to these cells resulted in edta-inhibitable processing of s <dig> to s1p , demonstrating that s <dig> expression and activity in the transfectants did not prevent s <dig> processing of exogenously added pt, though the level of processing in the s1+sp transfectant was apparently quite low.

the data from these transfectants do not rule out the possibility that s <dig> processing may contribute to the trafficking of pt to the er. however, the data are consistent with the idea that s <dig> processing is not essential for its activity in mammalian cells, and therefore that translocation of the full-length s <dig> across the er membrane occurs. this would distinguish pt from several other bacterial toxins of similar subunit structure, such as cholera toxin, heat-labile toxin and shiga toxin, for which processing of the a subunit is apparently important for cellular activity  <cit> . the difference may be in the association of the a subunit with the b oligomer. the other toxin a subunits have a relatively long helix that protrudes through a central pore in the b oligomer  <cit> , and cleavage of the a subunit is required to release the enzymatic domain from this complex. s <dig> has a relatively short helix associated with the b oligomer  <cit> , and therefore cleavage may be unnecessary for its release from the holotoxin complex in the er, or whichever compartment translocation occurs from.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have further characterized the cellular processing of the s <dig> subunit after pt interacts with mammalian cells. our major conclusion is that this processing event is not essential for pt activity in mammalian cells, based on several lines of evidence:  protease inhibitor studies showed a general lack of correlation between s <dig> processing and pt cellular activity;  mutant forms of pt in which s <dig> processing was apparently abolished retained significant  cellular activity; and  no s <dig> processing was apparent in transfected cells expressing active s <dig>  although we have not definitively ruled out a contribution of s <dig> processing to the cellular activity of pt due to the imperfect nature of our unprocessed mutants, it is possible that the processing event is completely unrelated to pt cytotoxicity and instead is an irrelevant activity occurring, possibly in lysosomes, on the large majority of the intracellular pool of pt molecules that do not enter the putative retrograde transport pathway to the er and then on to the cytosolic target proteins.
