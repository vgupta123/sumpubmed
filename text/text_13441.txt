BACKGROUND
proper regulation of substrate adhesion and cell motility is crucial for maintaining many cellular processes, including immune responses, angiogenesis and hemostasis  <cit> . misregulation of adhesion has been linked to the progression of cancer and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . the small g-protein rap is critically involved in the regulation of cellular adhesion in many model organisms  <cit> . rap belongs to the ras- subfamily of small g-proteins that switch between an inactive gdp bound and active gtp bound state  <cit> . in the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum rap <dig> appears to have an essential role and is involved in regulating a multitude of cellular functions among which cell shape regulation, chemotaxis, substrate adhesion, multicellular development and cytokinesis . despite the important role of dictyostelium rap <dig> in regulating adhesion  <cit> , the underlying signalling pathways are not fully understood. so far only the serine/threonine kinase phg <dig> has been identified as a key component of the rap1-mediated adhesion pathway  <cit> .

in mammalian cells rap has been extensively linked to integrin signalling; integrin activation depends on rap activity  <cit> . integrin proteins, which are transmembrane receptors that work as αβ heterodimers and link the extracellular matrix to signalling events inside the cell, are essential for the formation of adhesion complexes  <cit> . binding of the large protein talin to the cytoplasmic domain of β-integrins is the final and crucial step in integrin activation in leukocytes and platelets  <cit> . activation of rap allows for riam translocation to the sites of active rap at the cell membrane  <cit> . riam functions as a scaffold protein for talin and stimulates formation of adhesion complexes and subsequent integrin activation  <cit> .

there are no dictyostelium riam proteins  <cit> , while the only dictyostelium mrl  family protein binds to ras and not to active rap <dig>  <cit> . to identify potential rap <dig> effectors that regulate adhesion we performed a proteomic screen of rap <dig> interactors and found talinb. dictyostelium, similar to vertebrates, possesses two talin homologues  <cit> . while deletion of either talina or talinb does not strongly affect substrate adhesion of vegetative cells, deletion of both talina and talinb genes results in cells that are incapable of adhering to substrates  <cit> . during the dictyostelium developmental cycle, which is initiated by starvation, single cells form large multicellular aggregates that by primitive morphogenesis develop into fruiting bodies  <cit> . talinb is crucial for morphogenesis as it appears to mediate the transmission of force from the molecular motors inside the cell to the extracellular environment, which provides traction needed for movement in the multicellular structures  <cit> . lack of both talina and b homologues causes even stronger developmental defects as cells are incapable of forming tight multicellular aggregates, likely due to strong defects in cellular adhesion  <cit> . importantly both substrate adhesion  <cit>  and morphogenetic defects  <cit>  are also associated with talin mutants in higher eukaryotic systems.

we show here that dictyostelium rap <dig> directly interacts with the ra domain of talinb. importantly, this binding of talinb to activated rap <dig> is essential for talin-mediated adhesion during dictyostelium morphogenesis.

RESULTS
dictyostelium talinb is a downstream effector of rap1
we recently used a proteomic approach to identify new components of the dictyostelium rap <dig> signalling pathways: purified rap <dig> loaded with a non-hydrolysable gtp analogue was used as a bait in a large scale pull-down from dictyostelium cell lysates and the interactome was subsequently analysed by lc-ms  <cit> . a number of identified proteins, previously connected to processes related to cell migration, actin filament formation and multicellular development were identified in this screen . among these, talinb was identified with fourteen unique and specific peptides, which were not present in control samples . the amino acid sequence of dictyostelium talinb and mouse talin <dig> show conservation , especially in the head domain  and the c-terminal i/lweq domain . importantly, more detailed sequence alignments revealed that, like murine talin <dig>  <cit> , dictyostelium talinb contains a ra-like region in the f <dig> part of the ferm domain. although there is generally no high sequence conservation between different ra domains  <cit> , the f <dig> region of murine talin <dig>  showed 39 % sequence identity and 58 % sequence similarity to analogous sequence of dictyostelium talinb .fig.  <dig> n-terminal part of dictyostelium talinb has a putative ra domain. alignment of the putative ra domain of dictyostelium talina and talinb against the ra domains of human talin <dig>  ral-gds, riam and dictyostelium phg <dig>  the conserved lysine k <dig> that is mutated in gfp-talb-k16a is indicated. structural elements are indicated below for β-sheets  and α-helix 



to assess if the ra domain of talinb can directly bind to active rap <dig> we performed in vitro binding studies. the dictyostelium ra-talb domain  was purified as a gst- fusion protein from e.coli lysates by subsequent steps of affinity and size exclusion chromatography. this was followed by gst tag removal by tev protease digestion. the obtained ra-talb protein was used as prey in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with c-truncated recombinant gst-rap <dig> fusion protein as bait. rap <dig> was preloaded with gppnhp  or gdp  and incubated with gsh-beads in the presence or absence of ra-talb protein. the ra domain of talinb interacts with gppnhp loaded gst-rap <dig> protein, but not with inactive gst-rap1-gdp or gst alone . to further confirm and characterize the talinb/rap interaction in vitro gdi  assays were performed  <cit> . the assay is based on the general observation that effector binding to small g-proteins stabilizes nucleotide binding to the g-protein; therefore effectors of small g-proteins inhibit the dissociation of nucleotide from that g-protein  <cit> . incubating rap <dig> preloaded with the fluorescent nucleotide analogue  with an excess of non-fluorescent gppnhp results in nucleotide exchange that can be measured by a decay in fluorescence, from which the rate constant kobs is calculated. the addition of increasing concentrations of talb-ra results in a concentration dependent decrease of kobs . the affinity  between rap <dig> and talb-ra was determined from this dependency, yielding a kd of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  μm. in contrast, no inhibition of nucleotide exchange was observed when mgppnhp loaded rasg was used . together, the data show that talinb specifically interacts with active rap <dig> fig.  <dig> the ra domain of talinb interacts with rap <dig> in a nucleotide dependent manner. a pull down experiment with active and inactive gst-rap <dig> protein as bait and purified ra domain of talinb  as prey. ra-talb is precipitated with activated rap <dig> but not with inactive rap <dig> or gst control. b the dissociation rate of mgppnhp from rap <dig> was measured in the presence of varying concentration of ra-talb. these data were used to calculate the observed rate constants, kobs. the kobs values were plotted against the indicated effector concentration of ra-talb. the addition of increasing concentrations of the effector results in a concentration dependent decrease of kobs. these data were used to calculate the dissociation constant of the rap1gtp/ ra-talb



talinb - rap <dig> interaction is essential for multicellular development of dictyostelium cells
in silico analysis and crystallographic studies have shown that the interaction between small g-proteins and ra domains are mediated by exposed charged residues in the three secondary structure elements, β <dig>  β <dig> and α <dig> of the ubiquitin like fold of the ra domains  amino acid k <dig> of talinb is conserved in almost all ra domains and predicted to be one of the important positively charged amino acids for the ra/small g-protein interaction   <cit> . to study the biological relevance of the rap <dig> and talinb interaction in more detail, we generated and expressed a full-length talinb-k16a mutant fused to gfp in tala/talb-null cells. western blot analysis showed that both gfp-talb wild-type and the gfp-talb-k16a mutant proteins are expressed at similar levels in tala/talb-null cells , however a short degradation product is visible for the gfp-talb wild-type protein. confocal microscopy revealed that both wild-type gfp-talb and mutant gfp-talb-k16a are localized at the plasma membrane in cups . the experiments suggest that gfp-talb-k16a is properly expressed and folded in dictyostelium cells.fig.  <dig> a talinb mutant that does not interact with rap <dig> cannot rescue development of talb-null cells. a western blot with α-gfp antibody on dictyostelium tala/b-null cell lysate expressing gfp-talb or gfp-talb-k16a. b mutations in the ra domain of talinb do not influence protein localization. wild-type gfp-talb and mutated gfp-talb-k16a were overexpressed in tala/talb-null background and their localization was tested using confocal microscopy. scale bar represents 10 μm. c wild-type cells, talb-null cells and talb-null cells expressing wild-type gfp-talb or mutated gfp-talb-k16a were allowed to develop at non nutrient agar for 30 h; development of the cells was monitored by light microscopy. as previously shown talb-null cells are arrested in development at the mound phase. this defect cannot be rescued by the gfp-talb-k16a mutant.



upon starvation dictyostelium cells enter multicellular development stage which after 24 h results in the formation of fruiting bodies carrying spores of dictyostelium cells . at the late stages of development talinb is necessary for the cells to migrate within the multicellular structures, a process that depends on adhesion and force transmission between the cytoskeleton and cell exterior  <cit> . cells lacking talb are able to initiate starvation and form large aggregates, but the process stops at this mound stage and cells are unable to culminate and produce fruiting bodies  <cit>  . re-expression of gfp-talb in talb-null cells completely rescues the developmental defect and cells are able to produce normal fruiting bodies . in contrast, talb-null cells expressing gfp-talb-k16a are unable to culminate and produce spores, suggesting that talinb-rap <dig> interaction is essential for these processes.

talina and talinb dependent rap <dig> adhesion in vegetative cells
the strength of substrate adhesion of vegetative cells can be measured by a plate shaking assay  <cit> , where cells are incubated on a rotary shaker for an hour and the amount of attached and detached cells are calculated in triplicates the percentage of loose cells after one hour of shaking was not significantly different for tala-null  and, talb-null  compared to the wild-type strain  . this is consistent with previous studies that showed that either talina or talinb is sufficient for mediating dictyostelium adhesion  <cit> . deletion of both tala and talb results in cells that are incapable of adhering to substrates . consistently, with a previous report  <cit> , this defect in adhesion does not dependent on the rotation speed, as even cells that were kept stationary were unable to attach to substrates. expression of wild-type talinb in tala/talb-null cells resulted in adherent cells  similar to what is observed for tala-null and wild-type cells. in contrast, expression of the ra mutant talb-k16a in tala/talb-null cells resulted in only slightly improved cellular adhesion  as compared to tala/talb-null cells. these talb-k16a expressing cells are more adhesive than the 100 % loose parental tala/talb-null strain, but much less adhesive when compared to the 55 % loose cells of wild-type talinb in tala/talb-null cells. together the results suggest that direct binding of rap <dig> to the ra domain of talinb is important for talinb to mediate major cell attachment.fig.  <dig> adhesion of wild type and talin mutant cells to substratum. cells were allowed to adhere to the plastic surface of a petri dish and then shaken for 1 h at 150 rpm. shown is the percentage of cells that do not adhere to the plate. presented are the means and sd of four independent experiments. * indicates p <  <dig> ; ** indicates p <  <dig> ; *** indicates p <  <dig>  as determined by student t-test



we further used the inducible expression system  <cit>  to investigate the effects of hyperactivated dictyostelium rap <dig>  on talin mediated adhesion. as reported before, expression of rap1g12v in wild-type cells results in a strong increase of cell-substrate adhesion . in contrast, expression of rap1g12v in tala/talb-null cells has no effect on the adhesion properties of this stain. both the uninduced tala/talb-null control as well as the induced rap1g12v expressing cells showed the same characteristic phenotype; cells float in the growth medium and do not adhere to the substratum. this strongly suggests that the presence of talin is crucial for rap <dig> mediated cellular adhesion.

to address if rap-mediated increased adhesion depends on talina, talinb or both, we expressed rap1g12v in the tala-null or talb-null strains. wild-type cells expressing rap1g12v show within 24 h of induction a strong flattening of the cells which is associated with strongly increased cellular adhesion . interestingly, expression of rap1g12v in tala-null or talb-null cells had a significantly smaller effect on cell adhesion, resulting in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of loose cells, respectively . together the results show that rap <dig> can regulate the strength of cellular adhesion via both talina and talinb.

CONCLUSIONS
cellular adhesion is important during both the vegetative state as well as during multicellular development of dictyostelium cells. we showed that in vegetative cells rap1-mediated adhesion depends on the presence of either talina or talinb. our studies further showed direct binding interaction between talinb and rap <dig>  and the experiments with a talinb mutant that is incapable of binding rap <dig> revealed strongly diminished adhesion. moreover, we observed that overexpression of the dominant active rap1g12v in wild-type cells leads to strongly increased adhesion, whereas overexpression of rap1g12v in talb-null cells leads to only a mild increase of adhesion. these data strongly suggest that rap <dig> induces cell adhesion through direct binding to the ra domain of talinb . as shown by the developmental defect of talb-null cells, this interaction is especially important for processes that require strong adhesive forces such as during erection of the sorocarp. binding of small g-proteins to effectors can induce recruitment of the protein to the plasma membrane and/or activation of the protein  <cit> . we observed that both wild-type talinb and talinb-k16a are localized at the cups on plasma membrane , indicating that the localization of talinb at the plasma membrane does not depend on its ability to bind rap <dig>  this strongly suggest that rap <dig> regulates talinb signalling by local allosteric activation rather than by recruitment of the protein. such an allosteric mechanism of activation also has been proposed for the dictyostelium rap effector phg <dig>  but differs from the human rap effector riam and ras-regulated kinases such as raf- <dig> that regulate effector recruitment to the membrane rather than its direct activation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> model for the direct and indirect interaction of rap <dig> with talin in dictyostelium and mammalian cells. rap-mediated activation of talina induces basal adhesion, possibly through binding to the ra domain of phg <dig> in dictyostelium or riam in mammalian cells. activated rap can also bind directly to the ra domain of talinb, thereby inducing additional adhesion for force-demanding processes



several observations suggest that not all rap1-mediated adhesion is exclusively mediated by talinb. first, although the talinb-k16a mutant can no longer bind to rap <dig> and has strongly diminished adhesion relative to wild type talinb , its 89 % loose cells is significantly different from to 100 % loose cells of tala/talb-null cells. moreover, overexpression of dominant active rap1g12v in talb-null cells lead to enhanced adhesion, although not as strong as in wild-type cells overexpressing rap1g12v. both observations suggest that rap <dig> mediates partial adhesion in the absence of talinb. since rap1g12v does not induce adhesion in tala/talb-null cells, it is likely that the rap1-induced talb-independent adhesion is mediated by talina. the phenotype of rap1g12v in tala-null cells suggest that talina could indeed be responsible for rap1-mediated adhesion in vegetative cells. since we so far were unable to purify sufficient amounts of the talina ra domain for in vitro studies, we cannot exclude that active rap <dig> may bind to the head domain of talina. however we were unable to detect binding of rapa to talina in dictyostelium cell lysate. alternatively, the dictyostelium rap <dig> effector phg <dig> could be a key link in this pathway; rap1-mediated adhesion in vegetative cells depends on phg <dig> and cells lacking phg <dig> have reduced talina levels  <cit> . whether talina and phg <dig> are direct interaction partners remains unknown so far  <cit> .

also in mammalian cells rap may stimulate talin-mediated adhesion through two pathways with direct and indirect activation of talin isoforms, respectively. riam is a scaffold protein for talin. activation of rap induces riam translocation to the sites of active rap at the cell membrane where it stimulates talin <dig>  <cit>  by preventing the formation of auto-inhibitory talin fold  <cit> . as in dictyostelium this indirect pathway is responsible for the basal substratum adhesion . mammalian talin <dig> might also be involved in a direct pathway, since structural and biochemical studies with mouse talin <dig> revealed the presence of an ra like domain that specifically interacts with active rap. although the observed binding affinity of rap and talin <dig> was rather low and the biological significance of this interaction has not been shown yet  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate, that in analogy to dictyostelium, this direct pathway is involved in multicellular processes that require strong adhesion forces such as morphogenesis.
