BACKGROUND
in nature, gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level primarily by transcription factors that bind to dna. many of these transcription factors consist of two essential yet separable modules: a dna-binding domain and a functional domain  <cit> . artificial transcription factors  are composed of dna-binding and functional domains  <cit> , which can be fused together to create proteins that bind a chosen dna sequence and regulate expression of a specific gene in vivo  <cit> . construction of atfs in vitro includes construction of dna-binding and function domains by various methods. it is very important to design a dna-binding domain that recognizes a specific dna sequence. recently there has been a great deal of progress in the development of modular protein domains that recognize specific dna triplets. the cys2-his <dig> zinc finger motif is the ideal structural scaffold on which a sequence-specific protein may be constructed  <cit> . dna structural domains of zinc finger proteins  usually consist of  <dig> or  <dig> zinc fingers. artificial zfp  technology allows dna sequences to be selected directionally and a dna-binding domain to be designed  <cit> .

a <dig>  is a cytoplasmic zinc finger protein that inhibits nuclear factor kappa-b  activity and tumor necrosis factor -mediated programmed cell death  <cit> . a <dig> has been shown to prevent tnf-induced cytotoxicity in a variety of cell types including fibroblasts, b-lymphocytes, wehi  <dig> cells, nih 3t <dig> cells and endothelial cells  <cit> . over-expression of a <dig> inhibits il-1β-induced production of no by rat islets, which impacts positively on islet graft survival and function  <cit> . indeed, a20-deficient cells fail to terminate tnf-induced nf-κb activation  <cit> . lee et al. generated a20-deficient mice by targeted disruption. a <dig> -/- mice, born from interbred a <dig> +/- mice in mendelian ratios, developed runting as early as  <dig> week of age  <cit> . mice deficient in a <dig> developed severe inflammation and cachexia, were hypersensitive to both lipopolysaccharide and tnf, and died prematurely.

in the present study, to provide a basis for designing atfs that can regulate the human a <dig> gene, a zfp sequence involving six contiguous cys2his2-type zinc fingers was constructed using the classical cys2his2-type zinc finger model and an  <dig> bp dna sequence  obtained from the a <dig> gene promoter region.

RESULTS
transcription start site and presumptive promoter sequence of a <dig> gene
the dna sequence of the human a <dig> gene  was used to analyze the promoter region. trans-acting factors and related elements that may interact with the aforementioned sequence were analyzed by the online tfsearch <cit> , tess <cit>  and gene2promoter servers <cit> . the results indicated many trans-acting factors binding the relevant elements in the gene sequence, with several hsf binding sites at the distal end and  <dig> sp <dig> and  <dig> nf-κb binding sites in the gc-rich region at the proximal end.

the  <dig> bp sequence was submitted to gene2promoter of genomatix <cit>  to locate the a <dig> gene tss. the results indicated  <dig> sequence fragments that may contain tss sites. the features of these sequence fragments were compared with nucleic acid sequences of different histological origins, and the score of a  <dig> bp sequence within nc_ <dig>  <dig> - <dig> of the genome proved significantly higher than that of the other sequence fragments. hence, this  <dig> bp sequence probably includes the tss of the a <dig> gene. further analysis of the  <dig> bp sequence showed that the score of the site in genomic nc_ <dig>  <dig>  reached a peak . therefore, the tss of the a <dig> gene can be determined by bioinformatics methods. the results of prediction were consistent with the conclusions that krikos drew from an s <dig> nuclease protection assay  <cit> .

after the tss of the a <dig> gene was determined, the established promoter sequence of this gene was submitted to gene2promoter of the genomatix <cit>  and mcpromoter <cit>  online server  to analyze the presumptive promoter sequence further. the results suggested that the presumptive promoter might be located within genomic nc_ <dig> 138229781- <dig> and be  <dig> bp in length. moreover, analysis by the mcpromoter program based on a markov model suggested that the presumptive promoter may be a sequence approximately  <dig> bp in length, which is covered by the sequence predicted by gene2promoter .

these analyses defined the presumptive promoter sequence and tss of the a <dig> gene. in the light of the following study design, a  <dig> bp sequence fragment within nc_ <dig>  <dig> - <dig> of the a <dig> gene promoter was selected as the target sequence for study .

procurement of target sequence of a <dig> gene promoter region and zfp design
the presumptive promoter sequence obtained for the a <dig> gene was submitted to the zf tools server  <cit>  to "search dna sequence for contiguous target sites". after setting parameters and comparing with the characteristics of zfps, we obtained an  <dig> bp dna sequence 5'-cggccggctggacgcact-3' , which was considered to be the target sequence interacting with the artificial zfp. this target sequence was then submitted to "design a zinc finger protein". after setting parameters, we obtained the full-length amino acid sequence of the zfp , which comprised  <dig> amino acids. in the sequence, the gray bold letters separately refer to the - <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> sites in the α-helix of the zinc finger.

zfp sequence characterization and structural modeling
analysis by peptool lite indicated that the 176-amino acid sequence of the zfp involves  <dig> regularly aligned, contiguous cys2his2-type zinc fingers, which show the typical β-β-α secondary structure . zfp characterization using expasy proteomics tools – protscale suggested that the zfp has a theoretical isoelectric point of  <dig>  and a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda  <cit> . bulkiness analysis indicated significant decreases in the scores of the dense α-helix of each zinc finger in zfp, and the scores of the bulky β-fold were the highest  <cit> . analysis of polarity and accessible residues also confirmed that the constructed zfp sequence possessed the structural characteristics and possible biological activity of a typical zinc finger. in the absence of zn2+ , the instability index of zfp was calculated as  <dig> , indicating structural instability. the theoretical half-life of the zfp was predicted to be  <dig>  h in eukaryotic cells but only  <dig> min in e. coli. hence, if the zfp is to be expressed in prokaryotic cells, protease-deficient bacteria should be used to decrease catabolism of the heterogeneous zfp; moreover, zn2+ should be added to the medium to maintain the structural stability of the zfp.

3-d structural modeling of the zfp backbone was carried out using the online robetta server  <cit> . the zfp file  sent via e-mail was converted by raswin software to jpg format. the image showed  <dig> contiguous zinc fingers, forming an orderly helical structure .

construction of pires2-egfp/zfp-flag recombinants
the insert dna, a  <dig> bp fragment product amplified by pcr, was subcloned into the plasmid vectors pires2-egfp after double digestion by the restriction endonucleases xhoi and bamhi. the constructed recombinants underwent restriction digest analysis with xhoi and the digestion products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis; the result showed a clear electrophoretic band at approximately  <dig>  kb, consistent with the theoretical results. colony pcr analysis and the recombinant sequencing results showed that the construction of pires2-egfp/zfp-flag was successful.

expression of green fluorescent protein by cos- <dig> cells
in the pires2-egfp/zfp-flag transfection group, cells emitting green fluorescence were observed under the microscope  <dig> h after transfection;  <dig> h after transfection there were significantly more of these cells, up to dozens in each visual field , mostly emitting bright green fluorescence. the fluorescence intensity reached a peak  <dig> h after transfection, and the cells were found to form masses or pairs, with no significant differences between the nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities. in order to determine the transfection efficiency, the cells were counted in  <dig> random visual fields   <dig> h after transfection. of the  <dig> cells counted,  <dig> emitted green fluorescence . in the pires2-egfp control group, green fluorescence emitting cells were first observed  <dig> h after transfection. moreover, the number of cells emitting green fluorescence and the fluorescence intensity were higher in the pires2-egfp control group than in the pires2-egfp/zfp-flag transfection group at various times of cell culture. in the control group, no green fluorescence was observed .

zfp mrna and protein were expressed significantly in cos- <dig> cells after transfected
twenty-four hours after plasmid transfection, total rna was prepared from cos <dig> cells. electrophoresis showed that the total rna was not degraded. as expected, agarose gel electrophoresis indicated a marked specific band at  <dig> bp after rt-pcr amplification, consistent with the theoretical results . this result was not observed in the pires2-egfp control group. forty-eight hours after plasmid transfection, western blotting showed obvious protein bands in the pires2-egfp/zfp-flag transfection group, but not in the pires2-egfp control group, demonstrating successful expression of the zfp fusion flag .

dna binding activity
emsa experiments showed corresponding lag bands in the group of protein-specific probe binding reactions , but no relevant band in the negative control reaction array. in the super-shift reaction array, a lag band of the "antigen-antibody-specific probe complex" was observed . this experiment demonstrates that the zfp expressed by cos <dig> cells can bind to specific probes and possesses biological activity and, at the same time, has a correctly refolded 3-d structure. these findings provide clear evidence for the protein's ability to bind specifically to the target dna.

discussion
with the rapid development of bioinformatics, the volume of biological information in various databases has grown to huge proportions. most of this information could formerly be obtained only through laboratory research. however, theoretically ideal biological information can now be obtained through efficient use of bioinformatics tools  <cit> . this has allowed the research tools for modern genetics, biology, biochemistry and pharmacology to expand  <cit> .

these developments open new avenues in gene therapy by designing proteins that do not exist naturally but can regulate specific genes by simulating the structure of a naturally-occurring transcription factor. gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level primarily  by transcription factors that bind to dna  <cit> . to intervene in gene expression, the promoter of the gene of interest must first be studied. a gene promoter contains a series of na sequence elements adjoining the transcriptional start site , which directly activate or inhibit transcription. hence, the position of a promoter can be located through the tss, once this has been identified. therefore, precise location of the tss is the primary requirement for analyzing promoters and transcriptional regulation. the promoter of a gene is frequently located within  <dig> bp- <dig> bp upstream of the tss, and a typical core promoter includes a dna sequence covering about - <dig> bp-+ <dig> bp of the tss  <cit> . we defined the a <dig> gene promoter and its tss theoretically through bioinformatics analysis and showed many potentially important regulatory elements in the a <dig> promoter region.

an atf consists of a dna-binding domain and a functional domain  <cit> . the most crucial step in constructing an effective atf is to design the dna-binding domain successfully. since miller et al. found that the transcription factor tfiiia was a cys2his2-type zinc finger protein in xenopus oocytes <cit> ; hundreds of proteins controlling gene replication and transcription have been found containing zinc finger motif. the barbas laboratory developed a series of artificial zinc finger domains by the phage display technique, which recognized different members of the 5'-nnn-3' family of dna sequences   <cit> . they also used them to construct different atfs. thus, the zinc finger tools identify individual zinc fingers as a module of the protein's structural domain, and each of the contiguous dna triplets can specifically recognize an independent zinc finger module  <cit> . on this basis, as multiple zinc finger modules are integrated into a segment of polypeptide or protein sequence, the resulting sequence can in theory bind a dna sequence selectively. zf tools greatly lower the workload of researchers studying zfps. since the working data of zf tools are the results of phage display library screening, the results obtained are theoretically credible; nevertheless, they have to be verified in the laboratory.

structural modeling of proteins by homologous sequence comparison and alignment is relatively reliable. this method is based on the principle that the 3-d structure of a protein is more conserved than the primary structure <cit> . given this viewpoint, it is essential to acquire the crystal structures of homologous proteins as template. in fact, because of the increasing number of structural determinations of zfps, homologous modeling of new proteins containing zinc finger domains may be carried out. we successfully obtained the pdb files of zfps from the 3d-jigsaw, swiss-model and robetta online servers.

CONCLUSIONS
it is feasible to design specific zinc finger proteins by bioinformatics methods. this study provides a basis for artificially designing further complete transcription factors and intervening in the expression of the a <dig> gene.
