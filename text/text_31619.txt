BACKGROUND
the prefrontal cortex , particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , is markedly expanded and differentiated in the primate brain. in humans, the dlpfc  <cit>  and hence adult level performance in working memory  <cit>  may not fully mature until young adulthood. the functional integrity of the pfc is sensitive to modulation by catecholamines, particularly dopamine   <cit> . indeed, da is essential to the development and function of pfc controlled tasks of working memory, attention, behavioural flexibility, and planning that comprise executive function  <cit> . cortical da neurotransmission involves many genes and synchronised pre- and postsynaptic biochemical processes, interacting proteins, and enzymes. several of these genes and proteins, including those involved in the synthesis of da, in da reception, and da degradation were examined in this study to help define their roles during postnatal human brain development.

while previous studies have examined parameters of da neurotransmission in the developing rodent, pig, and non-human primate pfc  <cit>  few studies have done so in the human dlpfc over the postnatal lifespan. an early positron emission tomography  report examined both dopamine receptor d <dig>  and dopamine d <dig> receptor  in 19- <dig> year olds and found an increase in the ratio of drd <dig> to drd <dig> with increasing age  <cit> . in a more recent study, in vivo pet was employed to evaluate drd <dig> binding potential in twenty-eight late childhood/adolescent, and young adult healthy individuals and found drd <dig> binding potential declined significantly with age in the dlpfc  <cit> . the few studies examining the developmental trajectories in human pfc of the da degradation enzymes, monoamine oxidase a and b   <cit>  and catecholamine-o-methyltransferase   <cit>  showed developmental changes in protein but did not investigate mrna expression. previously, our laboratory measured developmental changes for tyrosine hydroxylase  protein expression and drd <dig>  drd <dig>  and dopamine d <dig> receptor  mrna levels in cortical layers by in situ hybridization in the dlpfc. th protein and drd <dig> mrna expression levels were high early in life and declined steadily with age whereas drd <dig> mrna expression was highest in young adulthood and drd <dig> expression did not change significantly over the postnatal lifespan. unfortunately, this study did not include any individuals between the ages of 1- <dig> years when numerous changes in brain function occur  <cit>  and cognitive processes are developing, particularly in executive function  <cit> .

in fact, it is during the school age period when disruptions in cortical da neurotransmission are thought to contribute to the development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder   <cit> . however, it is likely that changes in da neurotransmission in adhd occur in the background of normal changes in cortical da. dysfunction of da has also been implicated in another developmental neuropsychiatric illness striking in adolescence, schizophrenia  <cit> , where working memory impairments are one of the hallmarks associated with this disorders  <cit> . therefore, to better develop strategies to normalize da signalling in an age-appropriate manner, more information is needed about how the da system changes in human postnatal life. utilizing microarray technology, changes occurring in the mrna expression of dopamine-related gene products were examined across normal development of the human dlpfc and further confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr . because previous reports in the literature on the developmental patterns of drd <dig> mrna expression and binding are discrepant, we also included western blot to determine the protein levels of drd <dig> as well as to examine the protein levels of th, maoa, maob, and comt. our results indicate that the genes examined here are developmentally regulated over the protracted maturational period of the human dlpfc. the changes in gene and protein expression during postnatal life suggest that da neurotransmission requirements of the dlpfc vary throughout development and it may be that genes like drd <dig> and maoa may have multiple functions that vary with age. abundant da synthetic capacity in the dlpfc appears to lessen as postnatal development progresses yet da may take on a more targeted role in dlpfc functions such as in cognition, particularly after the first decade of life.

RESULTS
developmental cohort and demographic variables
the seven age groups for this cohort were matched on the demographic variables of age, ph, pmi and rin . pearson correlations with the demographic variables and the genes of interest are detailed in table  <dig>  ph was found to positively correlate with drd <dig> mrna, drd <dig> and maoa proteins  while pmi positively correlated with drd2s, drd <dig> mrnas, and th protein and was negatively correlated with drd <dig>  maoa, and maob proteins . all demographic variables correlating with genes of interest were entered as covariates in ancovas examining age group effects.

tyrosine hydroxylase
a th protein band was detected at the expected ~ <dig> kda size by western blot in each age group . western blots performed for the control protein Î²-actin, displayed no significant differences between the age groups . th protein levels varied significantly in intensity between the age groups  and th levels were highly and negatively correlated with age . post hoc analysis showed that the neonate , infant , and toddler  groups have significantly higher th protein levels than the four older groups . th protein levels decrease markedly between the infant and school age periods and then remain fairly constant into adulthood. the largest change in expression occurs early in life with a 67% reduction in th during the first  <dig> years after birth.

dopamine receptors
not all of the dopamine receptors were consistently detected by microarray in the dlpfc. drd <dig> and drd <dig> mrna were expressed at detectable levels whereas drd <dig> and drd <dig> mrna were not consistently expressed above 50% present .

the microarray data revealed that opposite to th protein, drd <dig> mrna increases significantly with age , reaching peak expression in the school age period and then declining slightly after adolescence. the drd <dig> qpcr mrna data showed a similar pattern to that of the microarray data with increasing mrna expression that weakly correlated with age  and there were no significant differences found in drd <dig> mrna by ancova between the age groups .

drd <dig> protein expression was strongly correlated with age . western blot results show the expected ~  <dig> kda mw band for drd <dig> protein at all time-points examined . ancova with ph and pmi revealed a significant effect of age group on drd <dig> protein expression . post hoc analysis revealed that drd <dig> protein levels rose substantially and steadily from neonatal to adult levels . adults and young adults had the highest levels of protein that significantly differed from neonates  infants , toddlers , and school age . the adolescent group also had greater levels of drd <dig> protein compared to the neonates  and infants .

using qpcr, the two drd <dig> isoform mrnas were easily and reliably detected. unlike drd <dig>  drd2s and drd2l mrna isoforms displayed a significant negative correlation with age . both drd2s  and drd2l  mrnas showed dramatic decreases in expression from the early age groups into adolescence. drd2s mrna expression was highest during the neonatal period with a substantial 84% downregulation of drd2s mrna between the toddler and school age years . the neonate , infant , and toddler  groups had significantly higher drd2s mrna from that of school age through adult groups. we detected significant differences between the neonate and toddler groups' drd2l mrna which both had higher levels compared to adolescent , young adult  and adult  age groups.

the drd <dig> qpcr gene expression data was quite variable and was not significantly correlated with age  nor did we detect significant differences in drd <dig> mrna between the age groups .

the microarray results for drd <dig> mrna suggested that expression changed very little over the lifespan . however, the drd <dig> qpcr analysis showed a slight negative correlation with age  although we did not find statistically significant differences overall between the age groups .

dopamine metabolism
microarray analyses of mrna encoding three enzymes involved in dopamine inactivation, maoa, maob, and comt were all found to significantly change expression levels during development.

maoa
regression analysis of the microarray data revealed that maoa mrna was highly expressed in the neonate and infant groups and then decreased significantly with age . similarly, qpcr revealed a slight negative correlation of maoa with age  and the mrna changed significantly between the age groups . post hoc analysis showed that the neonates had significantly higher levels of mrna compared to the infant , toddler, school age , adolescent , young adult and adult  age groups. infants also significantly differed from the school age  and young adult  age groups.

western blot confirmed maoa protein expression at the ~ <dig> kda mw band for all age groups . however, in stark contrast to the decrease with aging of maoa mrna, maoa protein positively correlated with age  with significant differences found between the age groups . the highest level of maoa protein was observed in the young adult group that significantly differed from neonates, infants, toddlers, school age  and the adolescent group . in fact, maoa protein levels more than doubled between the school age and adolescent age groups . adolescents and adults had greater maoa protein compared to the neonatal, infant, toddler, and school age groups .

maob
opposite to the maoa mrna expression which decreased with age, microarray analysis revealed that moab mrna increased dramatically with age peaking in adulthood . the qpcr study confirmed that maob mrna levels are positively correlated with age  and significantly changed between age groups . post hoc analysis showed that adults had greater maob mrna levels compared to neonatal , infant, toddler , and adolescent  age groups while the young adults also had higher levels of mrna to that of neonates , infants , and toddlers  as did the school age group compared to infants  and toddlers .

maob immunoreactivity with the expected ~ <dig> kda mw band was present at all ages . as with the mrna, the maob protein levels increased significantly with age  and differed between the age groups  with peak maob protein expression in the adolescent group. post hoc analysis showed that the adolescent group had significantly higher levels than the neonate, infant, toddler  and school age  age groups. the neonates had the lowest protein levels of all age groups with significant differences compared to the school age , adolescent, young adult and adult  age groups .

comt
the microarray data showed comt mrna decreased throughout development with slightly higher levels of expression at birth that gradually declined with age . the qpcr mrna study also showed a significant decrease in comt expression between the age groups  but did not correlate with age . neonates had significantly greater comt mrna than the infant , toddler , school age , adolescent , young adult  age groups.

western blot for comt showed two major bands of protein with the ~ <dig> kda membrane bound protein forming the most robust band and another band forming at ~ <dig> kda consistent with the soluble protein form. both bands were present in all age groups . age showed a weak negative correlation with expression for the ~ <dig> kda comt protein  but not with the ~ <dig> kda protein . there were no significant differences for age group with either comt protein band .

discussion
various components of the dopamine system displayed distinct and robust changes in both transcript and protein levels during postnatal development. thus, the prefrontal cortical da system shows quite dynamic developmental profiles in relation to da synthesis, receptor signalling, and da breakdown which all change as humans grow and mature. many da receptor mrnas showed dynamic changes across development. the most commonly observed developmental pattern was to have the highest expression in the youngest age groups, within the first five years of life followed by a decline in expression with age. the expression of drd2s, drd2l, and drd <dig> mrnas all displayed this pattern of downregulation with maturation as did th and maoa mrna. maoa was the only molecule that showed a pronounced decoupling between mrna and protein expression with the protein showing an increase with age. moab and drd <dig>  showed a gradual increase in expression with age. interestingly, drd <dig> was unique among the dopamine receptors in terms of its developmental profile and our results suggest that there is an increased role for drd <dig> as the human cortex matures.

previous reports suggest that by early adulthood drd <dig> is the most prevalent receptor in the pfc followed by drd <dig>  drd <dig>  and drd <dig> expression  <cit> . the results reported here show that while all other receptors are decreasing with age, drd <dig> mrna and protein levels are increasing in postnatal life. the increase in drd <dig> mrna expression with age is consistent with our earlier report in a different cohort that showed an increase in drd <dig> mrna expression in multiple cortical layers in the dlpfc during development  <cit>  with similar peaks of expression during adolescence and young adulthood. as more age groups are represented in this study our results here suggest that a substantial increase in drd <dig> mrna is evident even earlier at around the time of school age years where mrna levels were very similar to that of adolescent and young adult age groups.

the drd <dig> protein peak in expression appears to occur a few years later in life than that of mrna expression. drd <dig> is critical to pfc cognitive functioning and in particular working memory  <cit>  and these cognitive processes may not fully mature until the third decade of life  <cit>  thus, the change in drd <dig> from periadolescence into young adulthood happens during a time in development when the cortex and our cognitive behaviour are also maturing suggesting that da-drd <dig> may have an integrative role in higher cortical function.

while drd <dig> mrna and protein expression is low early in cortical development, drd <dig> expression is at its highest expression. this pattern of drd <dig> expression which is opposite to the drd <dig> pattern is interesting, given that both receptors are almost indistinguishable pharmacologically  <cit> . while all of the da receptors have been shown to play some role in cognition  <cit> , drd <dig> is consistently co-localised with drd <dig> on pyramidal neurons in the pfc  <cit> . drd <dig> has a ten-fold higher affinity for da as compared to drd <dig>  <cit>  and our finding of increased early expression of drd <dig> suggests that this receptor may play a more salient role in early postnatal cortical development than drd <dig>  thus, it may be that each receptor provides a differential contribution to da's influence over pyramidal neurons, dependent upon whether it is in early life or at maturation  <cit> .

to date, there are no published reports of the drd <dig> short and long isoforms in developing primate or human pfc and results in the developing rodent cerebral cortex have been inconsistent. a recent postnatal study in rodent cortex showed drd2s and drd2l mrna expression peaking in early development which is similar to our results  <cit> . in contrast, mack et al.,  reported that in whole rat brain extracted mrna, both isoforms increase expression throughout pre- and postnatal development with the highest levels occurring in adulthood  <cit> . a third study examined the isoforms in whole brain and found drd2s peaking at  <dig> days  and drd2l at  <dig> days  with mrna levels declining thereafter  <cit> . we find that in human pfc, drd <dig> transcripts exhibit high expression at birth that declines with age. our studies show that the developmental decrease in drd2s  may occur prior to drd2l  suggesting that during the school age period in normal children the balance of drd <dig> isoform signalling may favour the long isoform of the receptor. our earlier study examining drd <dig> mrna in pfc showed that the mrna was greatest during the first few months of postnatal life in all cortical layers. increased drd <dig> mrna early in development that is localised to both excitatory  <cit>  and inhibitory  <cit>  neurons, may enable da to modulate neuronal cell types, especially immature gaba neurons because interneurons, which show protracted maturation,  <cit>  are still differentiating in human dlfc postnatally  <cit> . also there is still considerable growth of cell soma, dendrites, and synapses occurring within the first five years of life  <cit>  when drd <dig> and drd <dig> mrna levels are high and drd <dig> levels are lowest. since drd <dig> is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, high drd <dig> levels may be important for attenuating pyramidal neuron activity when drd <dig> is high early in life.

rodent studies have shown varied results in the developmental pattern of drd <dig> mrna expression  <cit>  as have human studies  <cit> . the results presented here suggest that drd <dig> mrna expression may be variable throughout postnatal life. our previous postnatal study of laminar patterns of drd <dig> expression did not include the toddler or school age groups but did report that the highest levels of drd <dig> mrna expression occurred in the infant group, particularly in layer v and vi  <cit> . the lack of robust change in drd <dig> we find here suggests that age may not be a strong regulator of drd <dig> or that maintaining fairly steady drd <dig> is important throughout postnatal life.

as anticipated, th protein is in greater abundance during the first decade of life and recedes with age  <cit> . it may be that th and hence da are necessary in greater abundance during prenatal and early postnatal brain development in order to stimulate the establishment of other neurons and connections. indeed, th fibres appear early in embryonic cortex in the telencephalic wall as early as gestational week  <dig> in humans  <cit> . the crucial role of th in overall development is reinforced by the fact that th knockout mice do not survive beyond e <dig>   <cit> . as the pfc develops postnatally, the amount of th and da synthesis required may be much less. our results of high levels of th early in life in the human dlpfc, now found in two distinct cohorts  <cit> , suggests that there is a large synthetic demand for dopamine early in life when cortical pyramidal neurons  are still maturing  <cit>  and inhibitory interneurons are still migrating and differentiating  <cit> . it is also possible that while th and thus da synthesis decline, da innervation becomes more targeted and circuitry refined so that less da is required to be effective  <cit> .

another way to change the parameters of da action is to change the time course of action. the genes responsible for the inactivation via degradation of da were found to vary widely in their developmental profiles, with very significant and distinct patterns of expression and in some cases completely opposite profiles from transcription to protein. maoa mrna and comt mrna and protein exhibited the highest levels of expression in the earliest age groups, suggesting that da synthesis may be highest early in life and that increased metabolism of da  may be required to maintain a biochemical balance. but maoa protein, maob mrna and protein levels increased with age suggesting that later in life there may be increased breakdown of da through maos and that da's action may be temporarily restricted.

it is not clear why maoa mrna expression declined across development whereas maoa protein increased throughout development to reach peak levels in young adulthood. our findings do not appear spurious given that the maoa mrna data was confirmed in both the microarray and qpcr studies and the western results show the immunoreactive band of the expected size and to be robustly expressed. thus the maoa mrna may not be efficiently translated into protein or the maoa protein may be very unstable early in life. it is also possible that there is a presynaptic increase in maoa protein due to mrna that is synthesized in the brain stem and the protein is transported to axon terminals such that mrna and protein levels would appear uncoupled. previous binding studies of maoa in rodent suggest a profile similar to our protein results where maoa expression increases from p <dig>  plateau around p <dig> and gradually declines through adulthood  <cit> . in addition, mrna studies in the rodent are consistent with our mrna results where maoa expression declines  <cit> . however, the low level of maoa protein in early postnatal life is in contrast to published data on radiolabeled maoa activity in postmortem human frontal cortex that showed the highest maoa activity in humans less than one year of age  <cit> . further study is needed to resolve if species differences exist or if discrepancies in the developmental profiles of maoa mrna, protein expression, and activity levels exist.

unlike maoa, maob mrna and protein both increase throughout postnatal life. having low levels of maoa protein and maob protein expression early in life while da synthesis is presumably highest and da breakdown slower due to lower levels of maoa protein and maob protein with perhaps only comt at higher levels, suggests that the overall actions of dopamine may be prolonged in the infant pfc where presumably more da is available to be released and where there may be a delay in degradation through maoa and maob. this is particularly true for maob which has been shown to have a higher affinity for da than maoa  <cit>  and both moas have affinities for other catecholamines as well as serotonin and this may have a more broad influence over monoamine developmental availabilities. hence, maob may play an increasingly significant role in cortical da metabolism at maturation and in adult life.

comt mrna is more prominent in the pfc than in subcortical brain regions  <cit> . although the noradrenaline transporter  <cit> , vesicular monoamine transporter  <dig>  and mao  <cit>  contribute to da elimination, comt is responsible for approximately ~ 60% of all da degradation in the pfc  <cit>  and our results suggest that this may be higher earlier in postnatal life. the role of comt in maintaining da neurotransmission is clearly an important one. indeed, the th data would indicate that da synthesis and presumably da itself, is extremely abundant early in life with slightly higher levels of comt protein. comt mrna and protein displayed a decrease in expression. the higher gene expression of comt early in postnatal development is consistent with a previous report in rat where comt mrna was highly visible in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum at day p <dig> and with higher mrna levels at p <dig> in hypothalamic nuclei that diminished with age  <cit> . however, it is not likely that comt mrna and protein levels alone predict comt activity. in a previous study in human dlpfc we found increasing comt enzymatic activity with age was associated with the comt val158met polymorphism  <cit> , although genotype effects on mrna levels  <cit>  and protein  <cit>  levels are not consistent. further studies are needed to understand the developmental relationship between comt genotype, comt synthesis, comt activity, and da levels.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together these results indicate that pre- and postsynaptic genes of the dopamine system studied here are developmentally regulated over the protracted maturational period of the human dlpfc. the changes in gene and protein expression during postnatal life suggest that da neurotransmission requirements of the dlpfc vary throughout development and it may be that genes like drd <dig> and maoa may have multiple functions that vary with age. several genes that showed high early gene expression had their lowest levels of expression around the school age and adolescent periods . genes that had increased expression with age may be associated with healthy adult cognition and behaviour. abundant da in the dlpfc appears to lessen as postnatal development progresses yet da may take on a more targeted role in dlpfc functions such as in cognition, particularly after the first decade of life. our results underscore the need for greater understanding of how the drugs used to treat adhd, which increase cortical da neurotransmission and are typically given in school age children  <cit> , and schizophrenia, which block da neurotransmission  and are often given in adolescence,  <cit>  may alter these normal developmental trajectories.
