BACKGROUND
bovine babesiosis  is one of the most economically important infectious diseases affecting cattle worldwide. this tick-borne disease is mainly induced by intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites of the genus babesia, order piroplasmida and phylum apicomplexa
 <cit> . in southern africa, babesia bigemina and babesia bovis are the two economically important species infecting cattle and have high prevalence in tropical and subtropical regions of the world
 <cit> . clinical signs characterizing the disease caused by the two parasites are anemia, fever, hemoglobinuria, and in many cases death
 <cit> .

traditionally, the microscopic detection of babesia parasites has always been considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute babesiosis
 <cit> . however, the major drawback associated with microscopic examination of blood parasites is the low sensitivity offered by the technique, thus making it difficult to detect parasites in blood smears during low parasitemia in the case of carrier animals
 <cit> . alternatively, pcr-based assays have been widely used for the detection of babesia parasites owing to their high specificity and sensitivity
 <cit> .

at present, there are still limited tools available for the prevention and eradication of bovine babesiosis. by far, the most recommended approach for controlling ticks and tick-borne diseases in south africa is by integrating the strategic use of acaricides  and application of vaccines
 <cit> . however, more than 90% of resource-poor farmers contend that the dip wash is not effective in killing the ticks. consequently, these farmers complement the government dipping service with their own initiatives, which include spraying with conventional acaricides, using household disinfectants and manual removal
 <cit> .

it is estimated that, in south africa, approximately 18% of all cattle mortalities are due to tick-borne diseases including babesiosis, anaplasmosis and heartwater
 <cit> . these diseases have a considerable impact on the country’s economic security and also impact negatively on poor communities who are dependent on livestock production as their source of income and nutritional needs , and as labour for fieldwork and transport
 <cit> . as such, it is reported that the occurrence of b. bigemina and b. bovis in south african cattle population hampers the development of livestock industry, which accounts for up to 49% of the agricultural output
 <cit> .

given the importance of livestock production in the south african economic landscape, in this study, we genetically investigated the occurrence and distribution of babesia parasites, more specifically b. bigemina and b. bovis, in bovine samples randomly collected from different locations throughout south africa. we also studied the phylogenetic relatedness amongst dna sequences of randomly selected bovine samples.

methods
blood sample collection
experimental collection of blood samples from cattle was approved by the nzg ethics and scientific committee, national zoological gardens of south africa. between  <dig> and  <dig>  a total of  <dig> blood samples were randomly collected from clinically healthy cattle occupying different locations in all nine provinces of south africa: mpumalanga province , kwazulu-natal province , limpopo province , north west province , gauteng province , free state province , eastern cape province , northern cape province  and western cape province . the total number of animals sampled in each collection site depended on the number of cattle present at the sampling stations . no information on the age groups, husbandry practices, vaccination histories and tick infestation status of the sampled cattle were available, given that other bovine blood samples were collected and provided by the farmers. blood was collected from the coccygeal vein into edta-coated vacutainer tubes, transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at −20°c until further analysis.

dna extraction
genomic dna was extracted from  <dig> μl of blood using zr genomic dna™-tissue miniprep kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. extracted dna was eluted in  <dig> μl of dna elution buffer and stored at −20°c until further analysis. dna concentration was determined using a nanodrop® nd- <dig> .

primer design
four sets of oligonucleotide primers reported previously
 <cit>  were employed for detecting b. bigemina and b. bovis parasites in field blood samples. to obtain dna sequences for phylogenetic analysis, new sets of species-specific primers were designed . these primers targeted merozoite surface glycoprotein  <dig>  and rhoptry-associated protein  <dig>  genes specific for b. bigemina and b. bovis, respectively. the gp <dig> gene sequences of b. bigemina used for primer design were extracted from genbank under accession numbers jn049649–jn <dig> and af298631–af <dig>  the genbank accession numbers for b. bovis rap- <dig> sequences were fj588009–fj <dig> and af030056–af <dig> 

a group i oligonucleotide sequences were taken from published work
 <cit> .

b group ii primers were designed in this study.

the new pairs of pcr and nested pcr primers were designed from conserved regions identified after performing multiple sequence alignments with clustal w algorithm
 <cit>  embedded in bioedit software
 <cit> . the specificity of newly designed primers was tested against genbank sequences using blast search
 <cit> . all primers were synthesized by inqaba biotechnical industries.

specificity of nested pcr
purified dna samples of b. bigemina, b. bovis, anaplasma centrale, theileria parva and ehrlichia ruminantium were used to assess the specificity of group i and group ii primers. these dna samples were kindly provided by dr nicola collins  and dr oriel thekisoe . pcr and nested pcr mixtures were prepared and thermally cycled as described above using  <dig> μl of each of the purified dna samples.

pcr detection assays
to detect the presence of b. bigemina and b. bovis from bovine samples using group i primers, pcr was performed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing  <dig> μl of the extracted dna,  <dig>  μm of each primer and  <dig>  μl of dreamtaq green pcr master mix . negative control reactions contained distilled water instead of template dna. reaction mixtures were subjected to pcr using bio-rad t100™ thermal cycler . pcr amplifications  were performed at the following thermal conditions: 95°c for 3 min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for 30 sec, 55°c for 45 sec and 72°c for 1 min. following the final extension step at 72°c for 10 min, 1 μl of each pcr product was added into the second  pcr mixture comprising similar composition of reagents as the first round pcr, except that the external primers were replaced with the nested pcr primers. pcr mixtures were cycled as described above using annealing temperatures reflected in table 
 <dig> 

pcr-generated amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis in  <dig> % agarose gels stained with biotium gelred acid stain  and visualized under uv illumination. generuler™  <dig> kb plus dna ladder  was used as the standard molecular weight marker.

sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
for phylogenetic study, genomic dna of randomly selected field samples was amplified with group ii nested pcr primers  targeting gp <dig> and rap- <dig> fragments of b. bigemina and b. bovis, respectively. seven bovine samples were selected for b. bigemina and six for b. bovis. pcr mixtures were prepared and thermally cycled as described above employing the annealing temperatures reflected in table 
 <dig>  pcr-generated fragments of 853 bp  and 1009 bp  were sent to inqaba biotechnical industries for purification and sequencing in both directions using abi  <dig> xl genetic analyzer . at least two individually amplified dna fragments of each selected sample were sequenced.

nucleotide sequences were assembled and aligned using bioedit software program
 <cit> . the resulting consensus sequences were subsequently used to search for homologous sequences in genbank. to construct phylogenetic trees, the consensus nucleotide sequences were trimmed manually to equivalent lengths. phylogenies were inferred using the neighbour-joining algorithm of the mega v <dig>  software
 <cit> . bootstrapping analysis with  <dig> replicates was used to estimate the robustness of individual branches
 <cit> .

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
the determined b. bigemina gp <dig> and b. bovis rap- <dig> gene sequences were submitted to genbank database under the accession numbers kc894392-kc <dig> 

statistical analysis
the proportions for 95% confidence intervals  were computed as cis for proportions with binomial data employing no continuity correction.

RESULTS
blood samples collected from  <dig> cattle were genetically tested for the presence of babesia parasites. nested pcr assays with group i primers developed previously
 <cit>  were employed to detect b. bigemina and b. bovis pathogens in bovine samples collected from different locations throughout south africa. the samples presenting single amplification fragments of approximately 170 bp and 298 bp were considered positive for b. bigemina and b. bovis, respectively. the results of nested pcr amplification assays are presented in table 
 <dig> 

the animals infected with b. bigemina and b. bovis were found in all the provinces surveyed, albeit there were differences observed in the distribution of these hemoparasites in cattle from certain provinces. the occurrence of b. bigemina and b. bovis in cattle from all surveyed areas could be attributed to the presence and distribution of tick vectors transmitting these parasites. nested pcr assays detected mostly b. bigemina compared to b. bovis, and these results are similar to previous findings reported elsewhere
 <cit> . however, a notable exception was evident for blood samples collected from kuruman in the northern cape province where the occurrence of both babesia species was below 5%. this low prevalence is not unusual for an area that is considered free of babesiosis tick vectors.

the overall prevalence of b. bigemina and b. bovis in all samples was  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. samples from the free state province had the highest frequency of b. bigemina , followed by kwazulu-natal province with as high as  <dig> %  of samples tested positive for b. bigemina. these high prevalence values  were indicative of an endemically stable situation
 <cit> . by definition, an endemically stable situation occurs when 81–100% of the herd are infected with a particular babesia species
 <cit> . the highest number of samples positive for b. bovis was recorded in the north west province collection sites , thus indicating the situation approaching endemic stability but with the potential occurrence of disease outbreaks
 <cit> . of all the collection sites surveyed, kuruman area in northern cape province had the lowest prevalence of  <dig> %  for both b. bigemina and b. bovis. the cattle found to contain dna of both b. bigemina and b. bovis  originated from all but one of the nine provinces from which blood samples were collected. none of the blood samples collected from kuruman  possessed mixed infections.

in principle, the occurrence of b. bigemina and b. bovis in cattle is largely dependent on the distribution of tick vectors
 <cit> . the sole vector of b. bovis in south africa is rhiphicephalus  microplus, whereas b. bigemina is transmitted by r.  microplus, rhiphicephalus  decoloratus and rhiphicephalus evertsi evertsi <cit> . based on the geographical distribution of tick species in south africa, r.  microplus is more prevalent in kwazulu-natal, eastern cape and limpopo provinces, while the high prevalence of r.  decoloratus was recorded in mpumalanga, eastern cape and kwazulu-natal provinces. on the other hand, r. evertsi evertsi is reported to be present throughout south africa, except in arid areas of the northern cape and northern western cape provinces
 <cit> .

therefore, it is not surprising that in the present study, there was a high percentage of bovine samples positive for b. bigemina and b. bovis infections. these results confirm the previous findings that babesia infections are common in cattle in south africa
 <cit> . using serology-based assays, a recent study
 <cit>  demonstrated the existence of b. bigemina and b. bovis parasites in cattle from eight south african provinces surveyed. surprisingly, more than 20% of animals from northern cape province were found to possess b. bigemina and b. bovis when tested with ifat and elisa
 <cit> , and these values are considered higher for an area known to be free of r.  microplus, r.  decoloratus and r. evertsi evertsi tick vectors. according to the latter authors
 <cit> , the higher prevalence values could be explained by the possible outsourcing of animals from endemic areas in the neighbouring provinces.

to study the phylogenetic relationship between babesia parasites of randomly selected bovine samples, new sets of nested pcr primers  were designed based on nucleotide sequences of the gp <dig>  and rap- <dig>  genes. the specificity of both group i and group ii primers was tested against purified dna samples of b. bigemina, b. bovis, a. centrale, t. parva and e. ruminantium. as expected, the nested pcr assay with b. bigemina gene-specific primers only detected the dna of b. bigemina. likewise, b. bovis-specific nested pcr assay specifically identified b. bovis dna sample, and no amplifications were observed for dna samples derived from b. bigemina, a. marginale, t. parva and e. ruminantium.

the neighbour-joining tree inferred with gp <dig> gene sequences of b. bigemina isolates determined in this study is shown in figure 
 <dig>  the closely related sequences of b. bigemina gp <dig> genes retrieved from genbank were also incorporated in the phylogeny. from the phylogenetic analysis, it was worth noting that our isolates were clearly distinct from other closely related taxa whose sequences were obtained from genbank database . interestingly, wc- <dig> isolate  clustered with b. bigemina strains from genbank, suggesting the high genetic similarity of our isolate with published strains. as highlighted in the literature, the diversity observed between gp <dig> sequences of b. bigemina is not unusual. the high polymorphism of gp <dig> b-cell epitopes amongst the american isolates of b. bigemina was reported previously
 <cit> . given the nucleic acid sequence variations observed amongst the tested b. bigemina isolates, it may be expected that these sequence heterogeneities would induce changes in the protein structure.

in a phylogram generated with rap- <dig> gene sequences of b. bovis, as presented in figure 
 <dig>  it appears that b. bovis isolates tested in this study are phylogenetically similar to b. bovis strains originating from countries other than south africa. results on the genetic conservation between rap- <dig> sequences of b. bovis strains have also been reported elsewhere
 <cit> . nevertheless, our isolates formed a monophyletic grouping clearly distinct from that of other published b. bovis strains, and this suggested the presence of micro-heterogeneities among the rap- <dig> sequences within b. bovis species.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented in this study demonstrate a high incidence of cattle infection by b. bigemina and b. bovis in sampling areas from all provinces surveyed, with a notable exception of kuruman area  that displayed a very low occurrence of babesia parasites. the high prevalences  of b. bigemina in cattle from kwazulu-natal, limpopo, gauteng and free state sampling areas suggest that the situation of b. bigemina infection has reached endemic stability. conversely, the prevalence of b. bovis in bovine samples from kwazulu-natal, north west and gauteng collection sites suggests that the situation in these areas is progressing towards endemic stability. therefore, in order to attain endemic stability to babesia parasites, a limited number of tick vectors should be allowed to infest cattle, particularly in the case of herds occupying areas with lower infection rates.

in addition, this study has expanded our current knowledge concerning the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relatedness among b. bigemina and b. bovis isolates of south african origin. given the limited number of babesia-specific gene sequences available in genbank, particularly those of babesia species originating from south african cattle, further studies incorporating sampling sites representative of each surveyed province would be required. undoubtedly, this will enable a better understanding of the epidemiology of bovine babesiosis as well as the degree of genetic heterogeneities among b. bigemina and b. bovis isolates in south african cattle. overall, the findings from this study will ultimately help farmers develop efficient control strategies to curtail cattle mortalities emanating from bovine babesiosis.
