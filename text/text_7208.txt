BACKGROUND
paratuberculosis  is a chronic intestinal disease of ruminants caused by the bacterium mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. the disease is responsible for extensive economic losses worldwide related to fatality and loss of productivity  <cit> . the route of disease transmission is mainly faecal-oral; and neonates, when not infected congenitally are infected by ingestion of bacteria from infected teats or the pasture transmitted via the dissemination of diarrhoea from infected animals  <cit> . consequently the majority of animals within an infected herd or flock become infected  <cit> . however, in sheep infection can give rise to three different forms of disease with only about 30% of animals in an infected flock becoming clinically affected. the majority of animals are asymptomatic; they are infected but show no pathology and do not develop clinical disease  <cit> . the remaining clinically-affected sheep show two distinct forms of the disease. approximately 30% of disease cases are affected by the paucibacillary form of johne's disease; they have very few bacteria and show a t cell infiltration into the gut. about 70% of cases have the multibacillary form, which is characterized by a high level of bacterial infection and a macrophage and b cell infiltration into the gut lamina propria. both the pauci- and multibacillary forms are equally fatal but there is no evidence that the asymptomatic animals ever succumb to disease  <cit> .

johne's disease pathogenesis in cattle may differ from that in sheep as it is presumed that there is disease progression from the asymptomatic to paucibacillary and then to the fatal multibacillary form  <cit> . however, even in cattle 4–11% of animals in affected herds are infected but only 2–4% develop the disease  <cit> . like the two other major mycobacterial diseases, tuberculosis and leprosy, the epidemiology of paratuberculosis suggests a genetic susceptibility  <cit> . the paucibacillary cases  tend to have a strong cell-mediated immunity , high levels of ifnγ and il- <dig> and low levels of antibody  <cit> ; the multibacillary cases  have high antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and weak cmi  <cit> . little is known about the asymptomatic form although they are positive for bacterial growth, is <dig> and specific antibody  <cit> .

as with tuberculosis and leprosy it seems clear that the polarization of the immune response is critical to the clinical outcome of the paratuberculosis infection  <cit> . the intestinal tissue damage that results from a th <dig> response  is fundamentally different to that caused by a th <dig> response, which leads to multibacillary disease and dissemination of infection. the polarization of the immune response is controlled by the differential expression of t cell polarizing cytokines  <cit>  and it seems that there is differential expression of some of these cytokines in johne's disease  <cit> . several studies describe the changes in expression of cytokines in peripheral blood cells in cattle  <cit>  and ileal tissue of both sheep  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> . burrells el al.   <cit>  examined il- <dig> and ifnγ in both pauci- and multibacillary forms but not the asymptomatic animals while tanaka et al.  <cit>  quantified cytokines in granulomatous lesions during the preclinical stages of disease; all other studies on the target organ concentrated on analysis of the multibacillary form, including all studies on the ileal tissue in cattle.

this study tested the hypothesis that expression levels of a panel of thirteen cytokine and cytokine associated genes would be different at the site of infection in the three forms of sheep paratuberculosis, and that these differences could relate to the observed pathologies. furthermore, this study also analyses the asymptomatic form of sheep johne's disease in relation to uninfected control animals.

RESULTS
definition of pathological forms
all animals from the johne's disease infected flocks were identified as is <dig> positive by pcr analysis and therefore judged to be infected with map. three groups of is900+ animals could be discriminated on the basis of gross pathology, zn staining and histopathology. the asymptomatic group had no clinical signs or lesions consistent with johne's disease, at post mortem. examination of histological sections of the terminal ileum showed normal histology and no evidence of the presence of acid-fast bacteria  . all other sheep showed clinical signs and post mortem lesions consistent with johne's disease and could be further differentiated into two groups  on the basis of zn staining of histological sections of terminal ileum. the paucibacillary sheep had no detectable zn+ bacteria  and showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate into the lamina propria  comprising lymphocytes, eosinophils and multinucleate giant cells  with fewer macrophages . the multibacillary sheep had high numbers of zn+ acid-fast bacteria , mostly within the cytoplasm of the large numbers of epithelioid macrophages, which distend the lamina propria  and result in flattening of the surface mucosa . a fourth group of unrelated, control sheep were is <dig> negative and were judged to be uninfected with map.

gene expression analysis in ileal tissues
the expression levels of cytokine transcripts in sheep ileum from the three groups of paratuberculosis-infected sheep and in uninfected controls is shown in table  <dig> which shows transcript copy number in relation to the two housekeeping genes, gapdh and sdha. these data show that different cytokines are present at very different levels in ileal tissue, varying from less than  <dig> copies  to greater than  <dig>  copies . they also show that levels of individual cytokine transcripts show a high variability between animals, even within the same pathological group.

furthermore, it shows that individual cytokines are differentially expressed in the distinct disease states.

this is more clearly shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> where the results are expressed as statistically significant  fold change where data are compared in six pairs – paucibacillary vs asymptomatic, multibacillary vs asymptomatic, paucibacillary vs multibacillary , paucibacillary vs control, multibacillary vs control and asymptomatic vs control . the expression levels of two genes, il-1α and gm-csf was relatively consistent in all the animals regardless of disease status.

discussion
the three major mycobacterial diseases of mammals – tuberculosis, leprosy and paratuberculosis affect different organ systems but share at least two important characteristics. firstly, not all infected individuals become clinically affected and second, there are at least two pathological forms of each disease  <cit> . this is most obvious in human leprosy where, although there is a spectrum of disease, the majority of patients are at either end of that spectrum  <cit> . the tuberculoid form of the disease has lesions formed of infiltrating t cells and contain few bacteria; and the lepromatous form has lesions of infiltrating macrophages containing large numbers of bacteria  <cit> . the pathological picture of ruminant paratuberculosis seems to mimic human leprosy  <cit>  although this is most true of the disease in sheep where the pathology can be differentiated into tuberculoid , lepromatous  and asymptomatic   <cit> . there is a difference between these two diseases however as the sheep tuberculoid form is an end stage disease  <cit>  and it is not 'self-curing' as it is in leprosy  <cit> . there also seem to be differences between ovine and bovine paratuberculosis, as in cattle the pathological form seems to be related to the disease development  <cit> , with early stage tuberculoid lesions developing into end-stage lepromatous disease. in addition, intermediate stages between these two extremes have also been reported  <cit> . similar disease patterns are also observed in tuberculosis, but as with bovine paratuberculosis they seem to be more variable than leprosy  <cit> .

immunological responses to infectious disease challenge have a major bearing on the clinical manifestations of that infection and the clinical consequence for the host. this is most obvious in human leprosy  <cit>  where the type  <dig> t cell cytokine pattern predominates in the self-curing tuberculoid patients in contrast to the type  <dig> pattern in malign lepromatous disease. the aim of this present study is to try and understand the relationship between the immunology and the different pathological changes that occur as a result of mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection in sheep.

despite the fact that there is a large variation in the levels of cytokine transcript expression, this study shows unambiguously that there is a relationship between the three pathological forms of sheep paratuberculosis and the immune response as represented by the cytokine transcript profiles within the target tissue. the large variation is probably due to the fact that these sheep are unrelated, of different breeds and are infected naturally rather than experimentally; in addition they carry an unquantified gastrointestinal worm burden that might influence ileal cytokine expression. we cannot measure levels of functional protein for all the cytokines within the ileum but assume that the relative quantities of cytokine protein and transcript are linked.

as has been shown with bovine paratuberculosis  <cit> , the paucibacillary and multibacillary forms of the sheep disease are also associated with the polarization of the immune response. the comparison of each form of the disease with tissue from asymptomatic animals shows that ifnγ is significantly increased in the paucibacillary lesions and il- <dig> is raised in the multibacillary form. furthermore, direct comparison of the diseased tissues shows that these two cytokines are reciprocally expressed, although the increase  of ifnγ in paucibacillary ileum is not quite significant . this confirms that in sheep paratuberculosis polarized type  <dig> and type  <dig> t cells are strongly associated to paucibacillary and multibacillary pathology respectively. the major biological function of il- <dig> seems to be linked to inducing type  <dig> responses and stimulating ifnγ production  <cit> . however, the pattern of il- <dig> expression is not explained simply in terms of type  <dig> and type  <dig> responses as it is up-regulated in both disease forms. perhaps the increased tgfβ level in the multibacillary ileum explains the low ifnγ levels in that tissue  <cit> .

comparison of both disease forms to uninfected control samples shows up-regulation of traf- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifnγ, and tnfα, reflecting the high levels of inflammation present in the affected tissues and agrees with the data in cattle  <cit> . traf- <dig> is anti-apoptotic and its up-regulation in both disease forms indicates that it may be associated with the accumulation of several different cell types in the lamina propria and not just macrophages  <cit> . previous studies in stimulated pbmc from infected cattle have shown down-regulation of il-12p <dig> in infected cattle compared to controls  <cit> . however, this study showed significant  up-regulation of il-12p <dig> in paucibacillary samples . this may be explained by differences in the tissues tested or that il-12p <dig> levels reflect il- <dig> and not il-12p <dig>  il-1β and il- <dig> were also significantly raised in paucibacillary ileum compared to asymptomatic samples, the increase in multibacillary samples was large but without statistical significance . both have been shown previously to be up-regulated in multibacillary disease  <cit> , but as with il- <dig> and tnfα they are also associated with general inflammation. unlike other gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions  <cit> , the expression of large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines in paratuberculosis is not reflected in the large scale infiltration of neutrophils. a possible explanation for this is the presence of increased levels of tgfβ, which has known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions  <cit> . il- <dig> is absent from uninfected ileum but can be detected in both asymptomatic and multibacillary tissues; however, the low levels of transcripts present leave doubt about its biological relevance. our data only partly fit with the 'coussens' model of bovine paratuberculosis pathogenesis  <cit> . they are almost identical in relation to the t cell polarizing cytokines and most of the inflammatory mediators but contrasts in relation to il-1α. this cytokine is highly up-regulated in infected bovine tissue and the model hypothesises that the pathogenesis of paratuberculosis may be partly due to il-1α toxicity. however our data show that il-1α is virtually absent from sheep ileum. apart from species differences a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that all the sheep paratuberculosis tissues originate from terminal disease states and not during the development of the pathology.

of particular interest is the comparison between the infected, asymptomatic and the uninfected, control sheep. unlike cattle, where asymptomatic animals are regarded as 'preclinical' and show histological lesions  <cit> , asymptomatic sheep show completely normal ileal histology and their susceptibility to disease has been questioned  <cit> . the normality of the asymptomatic cases is largely confirmed by the fact that the majority of cytokines are expressed at 'normal' levels; however tnfα and il- <dig> are exceptions, tnfα is significantly up-regulated and il- <dig> is down-regulated in asymptomatic samples. the low levels of il- <dig> are not matched by a similar down-regulation of ifnγ.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have quantified the expression levels of thirteen important immunoregulatory genes in the three forms of ovine paratuberculosis using real-time rt-pcr analyses. we have confirmed that the paucibacillary and multibacillary pathologies are linked to type  <dig> and type  <dig> t cell responses respectively. however, many other cytokines are differentially expressed and it is clear that these cytokines are part of a complex network and interact to form the final pathologies. it is also clear that asymptomatic animals are also responding to infection, although the data do not explain how the disease is controlled in these animals. the epidemiology of the disease would suggest a genetic susceptibility similar to that recognised for tuberculosis and leprosy, and these data suggest several likely candidates for future genetic analysis.
