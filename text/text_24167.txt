BACKGROUND
biological nitrogen fixation is carried out by a limited number of prokaryotes that all possess a nitrogenase enzyme complex that reduces molecular dinitrogen to ammonia. nitrogen-fixing bacteria can be divided in two major groups: free-living nitrogen fixers or diazotrophs that directly assimilate ammonia for growth and symbiotic nitrogen fixers that pass ammonia to a eukaryotic host and indirectly profit from nitrogen fixation by occupying a particular ecological niche or by supporting the population through better feeding. in the latter group, the symbiosis between leguminous crop plants and rhizobia is of great importance for agriculture. the term "rhizobia" is used for bacteria that induce the formation of new organs, nodules, on the roots of a specific legume host. inside the nodule, rhizobia are internalized in plant cells where they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids .

nitrogen-fixing nodules typically occur on roots; however, some members of the subfamilies papilionoideae  and mimosoideae  form stem-located, aerial nodules  <cit> . these legumes grow in waterlogged soils of tropical regions and are characterized by dormant, stem-located adventitious root primordia that can develop into stem nodules upon inoculation with an appropriate microbial partner. although stem and root nodulation are similar, in the latter the nodular vascular system is connected to that of the stem via the vascular bundles of the adventitious root primordium  <cit> .

a particularly well-studied case of stem nodulation occurs in sesbania rostrata brem. upon inoculation with the microsymbiont azorhizobium caulinodans  <cit> . s. rostrata, a fast-growing annual shrub from the sahel region of west-africa, carries numerous adventitious root primordia that protrude through the stem cortex and epidermis, creating a circular fissure, where bacteria can invade and proliferate  <cit> . the growth properties and the high rate of nitrogen fixation of stem-nodulated plants make s. rostrata well fit as green manure in rice cultivation and, possibly, as a pioneer plant for wetland improvement  <cit> .

the bacterium, isolated from stem nodules  <cit>  and originally designated rhizobium sp. strain ors <dig>  was renamed azorhizobium caulinodans inspired by the stem nodulating capacity and by the diazotrophic properties of the strain . its host range for effective nodulation is very narrow: although nodulation of several sesbania sp. has been reported, nitrogen-fixing nodules are formed only on s. rostrata and s. punctata  <cit> . a. caulinodans also induces fix nodules on phaseolus vulgaris and leucaena leucocephala  <cit> . two features distinguish a. caulinodans from other rhizobia: its taxonomic position and its dual capacity for free-living and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. the latter is exceptional  <cit>  and implies a regulatory mechanism to either assimilate the ammonia or donate it to the plant in the symbiotic interaction. the first taxonomic study of a. caulinodans strain ors <dig>  <cit>  showed that it belongs to the rhodopseudomonas palustris rrna branch of purple bacteria, but that it is quite distinct from both rhodopseudomonas and bradyrhizobium spp. based on numerical analysis of phenotypes, protein patterns, and dna-dna and dna-rrna hybridizations, a. caulinodans was considered as a separate genus with xanthobacter as closest relative  <cit> . xanthobacter sp. are diazotrophic bacteria found in diverse soil habitats and in association with rice  roots  <cit> . comparison of 16s rrna sequences indicated that x. flavus and a. caulinodans are strongly related  <cit> .

here, we present the genome sequence of the a. caulinodans strain ors <dig> and discuss the annotation in function of the organism's biology with reference to comparative genomics. this information will stimulate the research on an organism that has real potential for novel applications in agriculture.

RESULTS
genome organization
sequencing of the genome of a. caulinodans strain ors <dig>  revealed a single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  <cit> . relevant genome features generated with the blastatlas tool  <cit>  are presented in figure  <dig> and can be viewed in detail as a web-based resource  <cit> . the putative origin of replication was predicted based on the position of a gc skew shift   <cit>  and coincided with the occurrence of a gene cluster typically associated with origins of replication in circular chromosomes of α-proteobacteria   <cit> . the specific distribution and orientation of the ftsk orienting polar sequences  motif 5'-gggnaggg-3', which is involved in loading the ftsk dna translocase and directing it to the replication terminus in α-proteobacteria  <cit> , confirmed the predicted location of the origin between azc_ <dig> and azc_ <dig> .

although the overall gc content of the a. caulinodans genome is 67% and the average gc incidence at the third position of the codon  is 85%, the chromosome has many islands of varying size with different gc  and gc <dig> contents . in accordance with the overall high gc content, the codon usage is shifted toward gc-rich codons  and, consequently, gc-coded amino acids are overrepresented .

combined computer prediction and similarity searches  revealed  <dig> protein-encoding genes with an average coding density of one gene in every  <dig> bp . with the blastp program , the amino acid sequences were compared with the sequences in the nonredundant protein database at ncbi. a putative function could be assigned to  <dig> genes ,  <dig> genes  were similar to hypothetical genes, and the remaining  <dig>  had no significant similarity to any registered gene .

a number of proteins that belong to a specific class.

b percentage of total proteins that belong to a specific class.

three rrna clusters are ordered as 5s-23s-16s  and all have an insertion of a trna-ile and a trna-ala between the 16s and 23s genes. a total of  <dig> trna genes representing  <dig> trna species for all  <dig> amino acids were assigned by sequence similarity and computer prediction with the trnascan-se program  <cit> . most of the trna genes are dispersed on the genome and are probably transcribed as single units. thirty out of  <dig> ribosomal protein genes occur in a cluster , whereas the others are scattered over the genome .

phylogeny and comparative genomics
for phylogenetic analysis , the genomes of a. caulinodans and of  <dig> α-proteobacteria were compared . the data set was assembled based on the available complete genome sequences  and ecological or phylogenetic relatedness. the resulting maximum-likelihood tree  showed a great concordance with α-proteobacterial trees based on complete 16s rrna genes  <cit>  or sets of protein families  <cit> . our analysis placed a. caulinodans closest to x. autotrophicus, nitrobacter winogradskyi, rhodopseudomonas palustris, and bradyrhizobium japonicum, consistent with previous taxonomic studies  <cit> . with a. caulinodans as a reference genome, a graphical representation of the blast hits of the proteins encoded by the genomes of the  <dig> closest relatives was generated with the blastatlas tool   <cit> .

for a broader view of the gene relationships, the occurrence and organization of the proteins encoded by these  <dig> genomes were evaluated . each gene of a total data set of  <dig>  was classified in one of four groups: orphans, genes without homologs in other bacteria of the data set; singletons, genes with one representative in the genome and homologs in other genomes; phage or integrase-related genes; and duplicated genes or paralogs with more than one paralog in the genome. the distribution of each of these categories differed in the surveyed genomes . paralog representation ranged from 5% for the neorickettsia sennetsu strain miyayama  to 44% for rhizobium leguminosarum bv. vicae  , whereas a. caulinodans had 36% paralogs . the data confirmed the observation that the number of paralogs strongly correlates with the genome size in a linear regression  <cit> .

altogether, these analyses demonstrate that currently x. autotrophicus is the closest sequenced relative of a. caulinodans. however, a comparison of the genomes with the artemis comparison tool  <cit>  revealed a very low degree of synteny . although short sequence stretches are conserved, extensive rearrangements have taken place. the occurrence of four prophages and numerous transposases in the a. caulinodans genome suggests a high genome plasticity. in a. caulinodans,  <dig> proteins have no counterpart in x. autotrophicus of which  <dig>  are catalogued as unknown or hypothetical . in the remaining group of functionally classified proteins, 46% have gc and gc <dig> contents different from the genome averages, suggesting recent acquisition.

functional protein classes and metabolic pathways
the putative protein-encoding genes were ordered into  <dig> classes  <cit>   and the metabolic potential of a. caulinodans was analyzed with the pathologic tool of the biocyc/metacyc suite  <cit> .

these analyses revealed the presence of many regulatory genes  and several rna polymerase σ factors, among which two household σ <dig> factors , two σ <dig> factors , and five σ factors of the extracytoplasmic subclass , implying responsiveness to many environmental triggers. as a. caulinodans is a motile bacterium, a large gene cluster is present  for the formation of a type-iii flagellum. a significant number of chemotaxis genes predicts the capacity to respond to a wide array of molecules . while no complete quorum sensing system could be detected, the presence of no less than five luxr-type response regulators suggests that a. caulinodans has the potential to listen in on acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated communication in its surroundings.

a variety of encoded proteins might offer protection against toxic compounds in the environment . examples are two cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases and pathways to degrade or modify plant-derived molecules, such as protocatechuate, and xenobiotics, such as cyanate,  <dig> -dichlorobenzene, octane, and gallate. several multidrug efflux pumps, antibiotic-modifying enzymes, and heavy metal translocation systems probably confer resistance to deleterious compounds. the production of the siderophores enterobactin and aerobactin might guarantee iron acquisition from the surroundings.

the surface of bacteria is important for recognition, attachment, and colonization during the interaction with a host. exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides are involved in nodulation as protective compounds against defense molecules generated by the plant and as communication signals  <cit> . other functions could relate to surface structures, important for interaction with the host , e.g. putative adhesion proteins, antigens, and  <dig> genes that code for proteins with ggdef/eal domains. the latter typically play a role in the transition from a motile planktonic form to a sessile biofilm by controlling the formation and degradation of the secondary messenger cyclic di-gmp  <cit> . hormones also play an important role in plant-microbe interactions. both a structural  and a regulatory gene  mediating degradation of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, are present in the genome.

over 15% of the genes are dedicated to "transport and binding", of which more than 50% belong to the atp-binding-cassette  transporter class. with  <dig> complete systems , and numerous orphan subunits scattered over the genome, the transporter complement of a. caulinodans equals that of many other soil bacteria. these high-affinity transport systems are dedicated to the uptake of peptides, amino acids, sugars, polyamines, siderophores, nitrate/sulfonate/bicarbonate, or c4-dicarboxylate and many unknown substrates . accordingly, catabolic pathways are predicted for compounds, such as amino acids , glucuronate, galactonate, galactarate, gluconate, quinate, l-idonate, creatinine, and 4-hydroxymandelate. sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, ribose, xylose, xylulose, and lactose are not metabolized by a. caulinodans; instead, dicarboxylic acids are used as primary carbon source  <cit> , as reflected by the presence of multiple c4-dicarboxylic acid transport systems. the occurrence of  <dig> putative alcohol dehydrogenase genes suggests that ethanol could be a major carbon source under flooded conditions. a. caulinodans is also capable of oxidizing hydrogen, an obligatory by-product of the nitrogenase, and the required hup, hyp, and hoxa genes are located in a large gene cluster   <cit> . encoded energy metabolism pathways include glycolysis, entner-doudoroff, and tca cycle. the absence of a gene encoding phosphofructokinase indicates the lack of a functional emden-meyerhof pathway.

nitrogen fixation and related functions
the transcriptional activator nifa  acts together with a σ <dig> factor rpon  to control the nif/fix gene expression  <cit> . nitrogen regulation of nifa expression is under control of the ntrbc  and ntryx  two-component systems  <cit>  that respond to the intracellular and extracellular nitrogen status, respectively. the expression of these two loci depends on a hypothetical σ <dig> factor rpof  <cit> , which presumably corresponds to azc_ <dig>  oxygen control of nifa expression is mediated by fixlj   <cit> , and the transcription factor fixk   <cit> . the nifa gene is further controlled at the transcriptional level by a lysr-type regulator  <cit>  and at the translational level by the nrfa gene product   <cit> . fixk also activates transcription of the cytnoqp operon , encoding the high-affinity terminal oxidase cytochrome cbb <dig> that is induced under microaerobiosis  <cit> . mutants in cytnoqp still fix nitrogen under free-living conditions, suggesting the occurrence of another terminal oxidase  <cit> . the survey of the genome excluded the presence of a second cytochrome cbb <dig> complex, but revealed two cytochrome bd complexes .

a symbiosis region
a region of  <dig>  kb, delimited by a gly-trna  and an integrase  and flanked by direct repeats , is characterized by an overall lower gc  and gc <dig> contents  than the genome averages, and a different preferential codon usage . no less than  <dig> putative transposases and three integrases are present, suggesting a complex history of horizontal gene transfer events. the region contains the three nod loci that are involved in the synthesis and secretion of the lipochitooligosaccharide nod factors   <cit> , but also genes related to chemotaxis, amino acid uptake, and a putative type-iv secretion system .

the three nod loci are not adjacent and have a gc content lower than that of the surrounding sequences . the shifts in gc content correspond to the location of repeated elements that are flanked by insertion sequences or trnas . the constitutively expressed nodd gene   <cit>  codes for a lysr-type regulator that activates transcription of the two other flavonoid-inducible nod loci. the inducible operon nodabcsuijznoechop   <cit>  encodes most of the enzymatic machinery for nf backbone synthesis, decoration, and secretion. the biochemical role of these proteins has been extensively described, except for the last four open reading frames noechop that are involved in nf arabinosylation and are still under study. based on similarity with proteins involved in arabinosylation of the cell wall in mycobacterium tuberculosis, noec , noeh , and noeo  might encode the synthesis of a d-arabinose precursor  <cit> . the third locus encodes the inducible nolk gene responsible for gdp-fucose synthesis for nf decoration   <cit> .

the symbiosis region also contains two conjugation-related gene clusters with gc and gc <dig> contents comparable to the genome averages. the cluster azc_3844-azc_ <dig> – flanked by two transposases – consists of repa and genes encoding conjugal transfer, partition, and plasmid stabilization proteins . in the cluster azc_3856– <dig>  flanked by a transposase and an integrase, genes are found that are homologous to the trbbcdejlfgi genes, a type-iv secretion system involved in conjugative transfer of the tumor-inducing plasmid in agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit>  .

the genome annotation indicates the presence of a few additional nodulation-related genes outside of the symbiosis region . two response regulators  homologous to nodw genes of bradyrhizobium japonicum and part of a two-component signal transduction system might be involved in the response to host-exuded flavonoids  <cit> . a nodt-related gene   <cit>  might act as the outer-membrane component in nf secretion together with the inner-membrane nodij proteins. none of these four potential nodulation genes has a different gc or gc <dig> content, in contrast to the nod genes of the symbiosis region.

discussion
azorhizobium caulinodans is a member of the α-proteobacteria, a group with diverse genome architectures. several plant-associated representatives, such as agrobacterium and sinorhizobium, have quite considerable genomes and large circular or linear plasmids. in contrast, a. caulinodans has a single circular chromosome of  <dig>  mb and no auxiliary replicons. the gc content and the coding density are in range with other rhizobia and soil bacteria. a. caulinodans is a motile, nitrogen-fixing, hydrogen-oxidizing, aerobic bacterium with a preference for organic acids as carbon source. this lifestyle is reflected in the metabolic pathways and in clusters for flagellum synthesis, motility, and chemotaxis. a high number of genes are dedicated to transport and regulation, indicating that a wide range of substrates can be taken up, but that the pathways are tightly regulated to limit the metabolic burden. besides the well-described role of surface polysaccharides during plant-microbe interactions, the genome of a. caulinodans encodes functions that might be involved in biofilm formation, possibly facilitating the interaction with a host. ongoing functional analysis will undoubtedly reveal new players in the ecology of the dual lifestyle of a. caulinodans  <cit> .

genome analysis combined with phylogenetic studies has shed new light on bacterial evolution and taxonomy. core functions can be identified that are highly conserved between related groups, but that may acquire individual characteristics through accessory genes  <cit> . analysis of a family of core proteins and 16s rdna sequence comparison revealed that the closest relative of a. caulinodans is xanthobacter autotrophicus. xanthobacter sp. are free-living nitrogen fixers and the nif and fix genes can thus be considered part of the core functions of the azorhizobium-xanthobacter group. the major difference in the lifestyle of both organisms is that a. caulinodans has acquired the ability to establish a symbiosis with s. rostrata.

the nodulation capacities are related to the presence of a symbiosis region with distinct gc and gc <dig> contents and codon usage. the association with trna loci, which presumably act as targets for the integration of foreign dna, and multiple transposons suggest a high plasticity of this region, as reflected in its composition. the symbiosis region contains three subclusters related to nodulation, nodabcsuijznoechop, nodd, and nolk that are flanked by sequences suggestive of independent horizontal acquisition. the repeated elements could be the relics of insertion elements that once played a role in the evolution of the a. caulinodans nodulation genes that have all the characteristics of archetypal accessory genes.

to study the evolution of nod genes, a. caulinodans forms an interesting case. the azorhizobial nod genes are only distantly related to their counterparts in other rhizobia. phylogenetic comparisons demonstrated that the noda and nodc genes from rhizobia that nodulate temperate legumes  are grouped together and the genes from rhizobia that nodulate tropical legumes  form a second cluster  <cit> . however, the noda, nodb, and nodc genes of a. caulinodans belong neither to the tropical nor the temperate clusters  <cit> . also, the genetic distance between the nodsu genes of a. caulinodans and their counterparts in other rhizobia is much greater than the mutual genetic distance between the nodsu genes of these rhizobia  <cit> . the organization of the nodabcsuij genes in a. caulinodans resembles the situation in b. japonicum, but the upstream and downstream regions are different  <cit> .

at present we do not know the origin of the symbiotic genes of a. caulinodans. the rhizobiaceae, which have been historically considered a true family in phylogenetic terms, now seem a rather diverse group of bacteria, including methylobacterium, ralstonia, and burkholderia that share variant, relatively recently acquired, symbiotic gene clusters. possibly, the a. caulinodans nod genes are derived from unexplored rhizobia or even from obligate endophytes. undoubtedly, the recent and ongoing explosion in meta-genomic projects will provide more insight into the origin of the nodulation functions.

CONCLUSIONS
extension of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to non-legume cereal plants is a challenging long-standing goal. especially, there is a growing interest in nitrogen-fixing organisms that could establish an endophytic, beneficial relation with important crops, such as rice and wheat . interestingly in this context, the occurrence of a. caulinodans has been reported in intercellular infection pockets located in the cortex of roots of arabidopsis thaliana and wheat  <cit> . in fields where s. rostrata and rice are grown as rotation crops, a. caulinodans seems to survive very well in the rhizosphere of the rice plants and in the soil  <cit> . moreover, the bacterium invades emerging lateral roots of rice, and rice seedlings inoculated with a. caulinodans have a high nitrogenase activity  <cit> . finally, a. caulinodans fixes nitrogen under relatively high oxygen tension as a free-living organism, invades the host via cracks, and establishes intercellular colonies. altogether, these features might be advantageous for primary infection of nitrogen-starved root systems and highlight the potential of a. caulinodans as a candidate model organism. the genome sequence data provide new opportunities for exploring the regulatory aspects of azorhizobium nitrogen fixation and the essential features that implement the ability for endosymbiosis.
