BACKGROUND
in addition to causing severe invasive infections in adults and neonates   <cit> , streptococcus agalactiae  is a major cause of bovine mastitis  <cit> , which is the dominant health disorder affecting milk production in the dairy industry, and is responsible for significant financial losses worldwide  <cit> . s. agalactiae has been isolated from a diversity of vertebrate hosts ranging from humans to crocodiles and fish  <cit> , and there is considerable evidence for host adaptation among strains, with both human and bovine sourced isolates showing a high degree of genetic distinctiveness  <cit> . therefore, the objectives of this study were to  assess how the genomic gene expression of bovine sourced s. agalactiae  responded to growth in bovine milk when compared to human sourced s. agalactiae, and  place our findings into a wider context via comparison of over  <dig> additional s. agalactiae genome sequences obtained from a variety of host species.

a principle now generally regarded as common to most or all bacteria is that of the pan-genome, which is comprised of both a set of core and dispensable genes, with only the former present in all isolates of that species  <cit> . there is now abundant evidence to support the view that the dispensable genes are fundamental to adaptive and phenotypic differences between strains  <cit> . earlier genomic studies of s. agalactiae gene expression used microarrays and did not focus on potential ecotypic adaptation.  <cit> . here we present the first comparative transcriptomic study of s. agalactiae based on rnaseq data. the comparison involves three s. agalactiae strains representing distinct ecotypes to elucidate possible genetic factors/adaptations likely important for s. agalactiae growth and survival in the bovine mammary gland. our findings reveal several genetic factors likely important in s. agalactiae’s adaptation to the bovine environment, in particular, genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.

methods
strain selection
the putative bovine adapted s. agalactiae strain used in this study  was obtained from a quarter milk sample isolated from a cow with mastitis in wayne county, ny, usa  <cit> . the strain was isolated in  <dig> and is mlst sequence type   <dig>  st- <dig> has been frequently isolated from cows suffering with mastitis  <cit> . the human sourced strain  was isolated from the blood of a female newborn with sepsis in göteborg, sweden . the strain was determined here to be st- <dig> using its genome sequence . st- <dig> has been frequently isolated from human sources  <cit> . s. agalactiae strains from the st- <dig> lineage have possibly the widest host range. strains have been isolated from humans, cattle, dogs, crocodiles, and grey seals, with the st showing high frequency in both human and bovine environments  <cit> . given that strains from this lineage might be adapted to both human and bovine environments, we also included a strain with this st in our analysis. we selected strain nem <dig>  as this strain has been included in numerous previous studies  and its genome has been sequenced  <cit> . while the strain has been described in the literature as being a human isolate, sørensen et al.  <cit>  showed its isolation source to be unknown.

no experimental research on vertebrates or any regulated invertebrates was performed. compliance with the arrive  guidelines is not applicable.

bacteria culturing
all strains were grown, in triplicate, in untreated bovine milk and todd hewitt broth with  <dig> % yeast extract  at 37ºc and normal atmospheric conditions. bovine milk with low somatic cell count  was collected and pooled from four cows , approximately  <dig> minutes prior to inoculation. overnight cultures of the strains were used to inoculate the milk and thy media to 1: <dig> dilution . cultures were grown to mid-exponential phase and harvested.

growth curve measurements for each strain were obtained using the drop plate method  <cit> . for each one-hour time point, serial dilutions were made  and plated  on tsaii with  <dig> % sheep blood and incubated overnight. after  <dig> hours, colonies were counted and cfu/μl was calculated. drops were considered countable if they contained 3- <dig> colonies. standard error for each pair of replicates at each time point was calculated .

lactose fermentation
strains were grown at 37°c in 7 ml phenol red broth base with meat extract  supplemented with 1% lactose . after  <dig> days the color of the media was noted. the media changed color to either yellow or orange. two ph measurements were taken for each. for yellow the average ph was  <dig> , for orange the average ph was  <dig> . a color change to yellow was taken as an indication of lactose fermentation.

rna extraction, cdna library construction, and sequencing
milk cultures at mid-exponential phase were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm and 4ºc for  <dig> minutes to pellet the bacteria. whey and fat were removed and the pellet re-suspended in  <dig>  ml of 1: <dig> mix of phosphate buffered saline  and rnaprotect . the solution was filtered through a five-micron filter to remove intact bovine cells while leaving behind s. agalactiae cells . cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for  <dig> minutes, supernatant removed, and the pellet frozen at -80ºc. thy cultures at mid-exponential phase were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm and 4ºc for  <dig> minutes to pellet the bacteria. the pellet was re-suspended in  <dig>  ml rnaprotect. following a second centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> minutes, the supernatant was removed and the pellet frozen at -80ºc. all pellets were re-suspended in 280 μl of te and combined with 300 μl of acidic phenol:choloroform  and 250 μl of  <dig>  mm glass beads . cells were mechanically disrupted and centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> minutes to separate them. 200 μl of the supernatant was combined with 700 μl qiagen rlt buffer containing 7 μl β-mercaptoethanol, and transferred to a qiagen rneasy mini kit column. the extraction was completed following the qiagen protocol, which included an on-the-column dnase digest . trace mammalian rna was removed from extracted rna samples using the microbenrich™ kit . samples were depleted of rrna using the microbexpress™ bacterial mrna enrichment kit. cdna libraries were constructed using the truseq rna sample prep kit  and sequenced using illumina hiseq  <dig>  . two separate replicates  grown in broth were excluded from sequencing due to suspected cross contamination. summary sequencing statistics are shown in table  <dig> 

the average proportion of reads passing the illumina quality filter for each replicate was  <dig> % . the number of aligned reads excludes reads ambiguously aligned to multiple locations within the respective genome sequence.

differential gene expression, functional annotation, and clustering
adaptor sequences were removed from illumina reads using cutadapt  <cit> . reads for each strain were then mapped to respective genome sequences using bwa  <cit> . genome sequences were obtained from genbank . short read alignments were converted to readable formats using samtools  <cit> , and the number of reads aligned to annotated genes was counted using r  <cit> . significant differences in expression between growth in milk and broth were determined using deseq  <cit> . the false discovery rate  procedure of benjamini and hochberg  <cit>  was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing . gene ontology  terms were assigned to genes showing significant differential expression using blast2go v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . these genes were also assigned go-slim terms using the generic go slim . go slim is a reduced version of the full go that contains a sub-set of more general go terms and excludes the more fine-grained specific terms. this approach provides a broad overview of the ontology and gene product function for genomic data.

genes for all three strains were delineated into homologous clusters using the mcl algorithm  <cit>  as implemented in the mclblastline pipeline . the pipeline uses markov clustering  to assign genes to homologous clusters based on a blastp search between all pairs of protein sequences using an e value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  the mcl algorithm was implemented using an inflation parameter of  <dig> . simulations have shown this value to be generally robust to false positives and negatives  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
the lacgefdcba genes from the lac. <dig> operon  for  <dig> streptococcus strains   were aligned using mafft v <dig> b  <cit>  as implemented in geneious v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . a maximum likelihood phylogeny with  <dig> bootstrap replicates was constructed using phyml v <dig>   <cit>  and the gtr + i + g substitution model, which was determined as the best fit for the data using modeltest v <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
differential gene expression
the human isolate showed considerably more differential expression when grown in bovine milk than the other two strains. specifically,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes for the human isolate, bovine isolate, and nem <dig> showed significantly more expression in bovine milk when compared to broth  . this represents  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total number of genes in each genome respectively. the isolates had similar numbers of genes with less expression in milk relative to broth : human =  <dig> , bovine =  <dig> , and nem316 =  <dig> .

the number of genes up regulated was not correlated with growth. for example, in milk, final cfus/μl were highest for nem <dig>  followed by the bovine isolate, and lastly the human isolate, with nem <dig> showing considerably more growth than the other two isolates . in broth, the isolates showed less variation in growth. nevertheless, nem <dig> again showed the highest growth, with the other two strains showing approximately equal growth. both nem <dig> and the bovine isolate showed higher growth in milk compared to broth. however, the difference was far more pronounced for nem <dig>  conversely, the human isolate showed more growth in broth than milk. combined, these observations suggest that nem <dig> and the bovine isolate are better adapted to the bovine environment than the human isolate.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the proportion of each of the go slim terms that were assigned to the genes showing differential expression. proportions are relative to the total number of terms assigned . therefore, the chart shows the proportional distribution of functional categories for the genes differentially expressed for each isolate. the right side of the chart shows proportions for terms assigned to genes that were up regulated, whereas the left side shows proportions for genes that were down regulated. for each term, fisher exact tests comparing the number of up regulated genes to the number of down regulated genes detected no significant differences for the bovine isolate or nem <dig> . however, tests for the human isolate detected  <dig> terms that were significantly underrepresented for up regulated genes and one term that was over represented . of these terms,  <dig> were for biological processes,  <dig> were for cellular component, and three were for molecular function. for the biological processes terms, metabolic and biosynthesis processes were the most frequent. for example, there were eight terms associated with metabolic processes and five terms associated with biosynthesis processes. the remaining three terms were for translation, gene expression, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy. these findings suggest a significant reduction in metabolic activity for the human isolate when grown in bovine milk.

the human isolate was also distinctive regarding genes involved in response to stress. specifically, the following four genes were up regulated: a csd family cold shock protein , a universal stress family protein , a heat shock protein grpe , and a heat-inducible transcription repressor . the isolate showed a similar stress response to growth in broth, with the following three stress response genes showing up regulation: a universal stress family protein , a heat shock protein htpx , and a molecular chaperone dnak sag0061_ <dig>  in contrast, the bovine isolate showed no up regulation for stress response genes in either environment and nem <dig> showed up regulation for just one gene when grown in milk: a cold shock protein . concordant with the growth patterns in milk, these results also suggest that the bovine isolate and nem <dig> are better adapted to the bovine environment than the human isolate. however, while these results also suggest that the bovine isolate and nem <dig> are better adapted to the broth environment than the human strain, this was not entirely reflected by the growth patterns in broth as the bovine and human isolates showed similar growth in this environment. in other words, despite the human isolate’s strong stress response in broth, it was still able to grow as well as the bovine isolate in this environment.

interestingly, strain nem <dig> does not appear as well-adapted to human blood as it does to milk. for example, mereghetti et al.  <cit>  reported that after  <dig> minutes growth at 37°c and 40°c the following stress response genes were up regulated: a universal stress family protein , two general stress proteins , a chaperone , a clpl protease , and a stress response regulator . conversely, nem <dig> might be as equally well adapted to human amniotic fluid, as it appeared to be to milk, as sitkiewicz et al.  <cit>  reported that it showed down regulation for all stress response genes when grown in this environment .

lactose operon
both the bovine isolate and nem <dig> showed up regulation for a shared eight or nine gene operon that has been shown to be involved in the transport and metabolism of lactose  <cit>  . the operon corresponds to what is referred to as lac. <dig>  <cit>  and utilizes the phosphoenolpyruvate -dependant sugar-phosphotransferase system . with one exception, the clustering analysis showed all genes in the operon for each of the two isolates to be homologous. the exception was nem <dig>  which possessed an additional gene: lact. another difference between the two operons was that lacr for the bovine isolate was orientated in the opposite direction to the remainder of the operon. gene order for the operon was as follows: lacrabcdfegx , lacrabcdtfegx . both lacr and lact may have regulatory functions. for example, lacr is a putative negative regulator of the operon that likely functions by binding to the promoter in the absence of lactose  <cit> , and in contrast to the remainder of the operon, this gene was not up regulated. lact is an antiterminator, which may function to regulate downstream expression of lacfegx. for lactobacillis casei, the lact gene product is believed to bind to a ribonucleic antiterminator  motif within an mrna secondary structure that prevents the formation of a rho-independent terminator stem-loop structure that would otherwise terminate downstream transcription  <cit> . for nem <dig>  lact was up regulated and a search of the upstream 392 bp intergenic region using the arnold webserver  detected a putative 65 bp rho-independent terminator motif with a stem-loop free energy of - <dig>  kcal/mol. in addition, a putative - <dig> promoter consensus sequence  was detected starting 98 bp upstream of the start of the terminator. although we could not detect a motif resembling the proposed rat consensus sequence of brown and thompson  <cit> , previously detected in streptococcus mutans <cit> , we did detect a 35 bp imperfect inverted repeat that was 100 bp upstream of the rho-independent terminator that might function as a rat.

while both the putatively bovine adapted isolates possessed lac. <dig>  the human isolate lacked it, and previous examination of genome sequences for seven human sourced isolates and one bovine sourced isolate also showed that lac. <dig> was only present in the bovine sourced isolate  <cit> . here we used blastn  to survey an additional 202 s. agalactiae genome sequences available on genbank  for the presence of lac. <dig>  these strains were isolated from a range of vertebrate hosts: human =  <dig>  bovine =  <dig>  tilapia =  <dig>  dolphin =  <dig>  bullfrog =  <dig>  and grey seal =  <dig>  lac. <dig> was present in  <dig> isolates. this included all  <dig> bovine sourced isolates and seven human sourced isolates. again using blastn, we determined the mlst st for each isolate . all of these genome sequences were wgs, and as a consequence, mlst alleles were occasionally truncated. therefore, we were unable to determine allele profiles for  <dig> isolates. of the seven human sourced isolates that possessed lac. <dig>  three were st- <dig>  two were undetermined, and the remaining two were st- <dig> and st- <dig>  st- <dig> and st- <dig> belong to clonal complex  <dig>  which also includes st- <dig> . these results clearly show a very strong correlation between lac. <dig> and the bovine environment .

we identified  <dig> different sts for the bovine isolates  and previous studies have shown these sts to not cluster together in phylogentic analyses  <cit> . furthermore, there were numerous examples where the possession of lac. <dig> was not conserved for all isolates of the same st. for example, st- <dig> occurred  <dig> times, yet only three of the isolates with this st possessed lac. <dig> . other examples were st- <dig> , st- <dig> , st- <dig> , and st- <dig> . combined, these findings strongly suggest that acquisition of lac. <dig> was via lateral gene transfer  rather than vertical inheritance. lgt of this operon is further supported by previous work showing that lac. <dig> was likely exchanged between a bovine sourced isolate of s. agalactiae and another mastitis causing pathogen streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae via an integrative conjugative element   <cit> . furthermore, lac. <dig> is also within an ice for nem <dig> and another species of streptococcus   <cit> . strain fsl s3- <dig> was isolated from a cow with an intra-mammary infection that belonged to a dairy herd experiencing an outbreak of s. canis induced mastitis  <cit> .

evolution of lac.2
we further explored the evolutionary history of lac. <dig> by aligning the operon from each s. agalactiae isolate to  <dig> additional streptococcus species representing a range of phylogenetic groups  and then constructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny . the genes lacx, lact, and lacr were not consistently present in all isolates nor species and were therefore excluded from the analysis. within the phylogeny, the lac. <dig> sequences for s. agalactiae formed four major groupings  that were strongly supported. three  clustered together, while the fourth , which contained nem <dig>  was very distantly related . as described above, s. agalactiae isolates possessed one of two different types of lac. <dig> operon. here we designate them lac.2- <dig>  and lac.2- <dig> . four isolates within group d lacked lacr . when the two types of lac. <dig> were overlain on the phylogeny, they clustered separately, with groups a, b, and c exclusively containing lac.2- <dig> and group d exclusively containing lac.2- <dig>  suggesting distinct evolutionary histories for the lac. <dig> types. four of the additional streptococcus species fell within group d  and two within group c . the close relationship between these additional species and the s. agalactiae group they fell within, compared to the much larger evolutionary distance among the s. agalactiae groups lends further support for the lateral exchange of lac. <dig> between s. agalactiae and other streptococcus species. it’s noteworthy that s. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, and s. parauberis are major causes of mastitis and were all isolated from the bovine environment, suggesting this exchange may have occurred within this environment. however, three additional streptococcus species, all isolated from the human environment, also fell within groups c  and d , raising the possibility that exchange may have also occurred in the human environment. one s. agalactiae strain  was particularly interesting, as it possessed both types of lac. <dig>  with the phylogeny showing them to be highly divergent, likely reflecting acquisition of the operon on separate occasions from different species. none of the additional species included in the phylogeny fell within groups a and b. therefore, in an attempt to identify possible donor species, we performed a blastn search of the nr database at ncbi using a representative sequence from each group. the best hit for each group was streptococcus sanguinis  and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis . unfortunately, these two species were already included in our phylogeny and were the closest species to each group. consequently, the likely donor species for these two groups remains unknown.

the role of lac.1
the previous examination of genome sequences for seven human and one bovine sourced isolate showed that in addition to lac. <dig>  all s. agalactiae isolates possessed a second lactose operon lac.1: lacr-iia-iib-iic-neuraminidase-abcdx <cit> . the clustering analysis performed here showed that although genes abcdx were homologous with those in lac. <dig>  the operon lacked lacg, a cytoplasmic phospho-β-galactosidase that hydrolyzes the lactose-6-phosphate produced when lactose is transported into the cell via the pts. the lactose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed to galactose-6-phosphate prior to it passing through the tagatose-6-phosphate pathway. consequently, the absence of lacg in lac. <dig> suggests that the operon’s primary function is not the metabolism of lactose, and loughman and caparon  <cit>  suggested a virulent role for the operon in s. pyogenes. similarly, lac. <dig> in s. agalactiae contains neuraminidase, which has been implicated in virulence, also suggesting an alternative role for the operon  <cit> . however, a blastn search for lacg in the  <dig> genome sequences showed it to be present somewhere within the genome of all isolates, raising the possibility that the lac. <dig> operon, in concert with lacg, might still play a role in lactose metabolism. however, while the differential expression analysis showed lac. <dig> to be up regulated in milk for the human isolate and nem <dig> , lacg was not upregulated. for the bovine isolate, lac. <dig> showed no differential expression, which was likely due to the fact that the operon had been split into two fragments, probably due to insertion sequences that flanked one of the fragments. similarly, lac. <dig> in bovine isolate fsl s3- <dig> was also fragmented by insertion sequences  <cit> . using blastn we surveyed the  <dig> genome sequences for the presence of lac. <dig>  for all isolates, we found the operon to be either contiguous, or its genes to be distributed on two or more contigs. it was contiguous in  <dig> isolates , and distributed on two or more contigs in  <dig> isolates .

lactose fermentation
to further investigate the ability of different s. agalactiae isolates to metabolize lactose and the roles of lac. <dig> and lac. <dig>  we performed a lactose fermentation test on a set of  <dig> isolates . these isolates represented a subset of the  <dig> isolates whose genome sequences we analyzed earlier, plus the isolates analyzed here using rnaseq data and the bovine isolate fsl s3- <dig> . all isolates possessing lac. <dig> showed a positive result for lactose fermentation , lending further support to the role of lac. <dig> in lactose metabolism. with the exception of three isolates that showed no color change, the media for all remaining isolates changed to orange, suggesting some minimal acid production and fermentation activity. although showing positive for lactose fermentation, the genome sequence of strain fsl s3- <dig> lacked lac. <dig>  we designed a pcr test to investigate whether this was due to a sequencing omission . primers designed within lacf and lacg amplified a ~ <dig>  kbp region specific to lac. <dig>  confirming the operon’s presence. although it’s possible that a similar sequencing omission could have occurred in another strain, an omission of this size is likely a rare occurrence.

overall, our results suggest that the ability to metabolize lactose at a significant level, was acquired via the lateral transfer of the lac. <dig> operon and that this was likely an important adaptation to the bovine environment. furthermore, this mechanism permits rapid adaptation and may explain why some sts suddenly become more prevalent within the bovine environment. for example, the recent rapid increase in the prevalence of st- <dig>  st- <dig>  and st- <dig> in danish dairy herds  <cit> . these findings also serve to highlight how attempts to correlate adaptive traits with sts may be misleading .

assuming that s. agalactiae acquired lac. <dig> within the bovine environment, the isolation of strains from the human environment possessing lac. <dig> highlights the potential for the bovine environment to serve as a reservoir for the emergence of more virulent strains with subsequent transmission to the human population. furthermore, if lgt is the dominant adaptive process, as also proposed by sørenson et al.  <cit> , a dependence on mlst as the primary source of molecular epidemiological data will likely prove inadequate for accurate elucidation of these processes. for example, the proposal that the hyperinvasive neonatal st- <dig> evolved via vertical inheritance from a bovine ancestor  <cit>  was based on a phylogenetic analysis of st data. however, more detailed genomic examination has called the accuracy of this relationship into question  <cit> , and our results additionally provide no support for this relationship. specifically, fifteen of the genome sequences surveyed here were st- <dig> and none of these isolates possessed lac. <dig>  therefore, our results provide no support for st- <dig> being derived from a bovine adapted strain.

additional patterns of differential expression
there were nine genes uniquely up regulated in the bovine isolate . two were hypothetical proteins and in general the remainder had roles in binding and membrane transport. one of the genes involved in membrane transport was a copper-transporter atpase copa. while essential for life, copper is also highly toxic to cells in excess. the copa gene product is a copper efflux atpase involved in copper homeostasis  <cit> , and disruption of the gene in escherichia coli has been shown to produce sensitivity to copper  <cit> . copper is present as a trace element in bovine milk  <cit>  and up regulation of copa may contribute to extended survival for the bovine isolate within the udder.

in addition to the lac. <dig> genes, there were five up regulated genes shared between the bovine isolate and nem <dig> that were not up regulated for the human isolate . these genes were all involved in metabolic processes, with four of them specifically involved in the metabolism of purine  and pyrimidine . the purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways have been shown to be critical for growth in human blood for other gram positive and negative bacteria  <cit> , and our results show they may also be important for growth in bovine milk. however, mereghetti et al.  <cit>  found considerably greater expression for these pathways in nem <dig> when grown in human blood. specifically, ten of the  <dig> genes in the purine pathway and five of the six genes in the pyrimidine pathway were up regulated, suggesting a more important role during growth in blood than milk. in addition, these observations describe a distinctive metabolic contrast for nem <dig> when grown in bovine milk compared to human blood. in milk, all of the genes in the lac. <dig> operon were up regulated, whereas only four genes in the purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways were up regulated. in contrast, growth in blood resulted in up regulation of all the genes in the purine and pyrimidine pathways and just two in lac. <dig>   <cit> . these observations reveal a metabolic flexibility for nem <dig>  where the strain can up or down regulate different metabolic pathways to various levels of expression depending on the environment.

the fifth of the up regulated genes shared between the bovine isolate and nem <dig> was a gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase . an important activity of some members of this family of genes is antibiotic  resistance  <cit> . to explore the gene’s role in s. agalactiae further, we performed a blastn search of the nr database at ncbi using the nem <dig> nucleotide sequence. the top five hits were for s. agalactiae strains, with each hit having a similar gene annotation to nem <dig>  however, the next best hit was for a zwittermicin a resistance protein zmar from lactobacillus salivarius , lending support to the possibility that the s. agalactiae gnat gene may also be involved in antibiotic resistance. s. agalactiae infection is frequently treated with antibiotics  <cit> . furthermore, blanket dry cow therapy  is now common place within the us dairy industry  <cit> . a commonly used antibiotic is penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin   <cit>  and dihydrostreptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. consequently, up regulation of the putative antibiotic resistance gene might reflect an adaptation to this type of treatment where growth in milk elicits high expression of the gene for bovine adapted strains. indeed, brown and scasserra  <cit>  reported low susceptibility to streptomycin for s. agalactiae isolated from bovine mammary glands. an alternative explanation for up regulation of the gene is the presence of an antibiotic in the milk sample. this seems unlikely as none of the four cows providing the milk were treated with antibiotics for six months prior to milk collection. regardless, the potential role of this gene in antibiotic resistance remains preliminary without further functional analyses.

for nem <dig>  there were  <dig> uniquely up regulated genes . in general, these genes had roles in oxidation-reduction processes and membrane transport. one of these genes was a glycerol dehydrogenase. these enzymes are utilized in the metabolism of glycerol, which bacteria can use as a carbon source in anaerobic conditions through coupled oxidative and reductive pathways  <cit> . the triglycerides in bovine milk contain glycerol and the up regulation of glycerol dehydrogenase for nem <dig> suggests that the isolate might be utilizing glycerol as a carbon source. furthermore, glycerol-catabolizing enzymes have been shown to be important for bacterial growth  <cit>  and nem <dig> showed considerably more growth in milk than the other two isolates . an additional up regulated dehydrogenase was d-lactate dehydrogenase. lactose is composed of β-d-galactose and α/β-d-glucose. after transport of lactose into the cell via the pts, lacg hydrolyzes lactose-6-phosphate into both galactose-6-phosphate and glucose  <cit>  . the final product of the glycolysis of glucose is pyruvate, and when oxygen is absent or in short supply, d-lactate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to lactate  <cit> . consequently, up regulation of d-lactate dehydrogenase suggests active metabolism of the glucose component of lactose for nem <dig>  glucose metabolism is also indicated by the up regulation of α-acetolactate decarboxylase, which is involved in the anabolism of acetoin from pyruvate  <cit> . this gene activity might again contribute to strain nem316’s stronger growth in milk.

nisin and insertion sequences
streptococcus uberis possesses an 11-gene operon for the production of the lantibiotic nisin  <cit> . the operon is part of the species' dispensable genome,  <cit>  and pryor et al.  <cit>  showed that nisin producer strains dominated non-producer strains during intramammary infection, suggesting a competitive advantage. s. agalactiae  also possesses the operon  <cit> . however, the operon is disrupted by an insertion sequence  and a deferred antagonism test showed the strain to not produce nisin. the bovine s. agalactiae isolate studied here  also possessed the operon; but again the operon was disrupted by insertion sequences . however, all  <dig> operon genes showed some expression in milk, whereas only five showed expression in broth. however, this expression was not significantly different between the two environments and a previous deferred antagonism test showed the strain to not produce nisin  <cit> . similar to strain fsl s3- <dig>  strain fsl s3- <dig> also possessed numerous insertion sequences  throughout its genome, lending further support to the importance of is activity in the evolution of s. agalactiae. a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig> is showed no gene expression in either milk or broth, while  <dig> is were expressed in both environments, although not differentially, suggesting some is activity in both environments. four is showed negligible expression in milk only. the human isolate contained considerably fewer is . however, there was a similar number of is showing expression in both environments . the lower number of is for human isolates may be typical, as the average number of is for the human s. agalactiae isolates 2603 v/r, h36b, 18rs <dig>  a <dig>   <dig>  cjb <dig>  and coh <dig> was  <dig>  <cit> . nem <dig> is somewhat distinctive in that it possesses a comparatively very low number of is , with three showing expression in both environments. the high number of is for the bovine isolates might reflect a degree of specialization to this environment. for example, several studies have suggested that proliferation of insertion sequences is an evolutionary signature that accompanies the transition to a more specialized life style  <cit> . specifically, in any population, the transposition of is into genes occurs at a particular rate, and in large populations, if a transposition is lethal or results in a selective disadvantage, the bacterial will be removed from the population via purifying selection. however, the reduction in population size that typically accompanies specialization increases the effect of genetic drift, which is now able to fix more of the deleterious transpositions into the population. the very low number of is for nem <dig> might reflect a larger population size associated with a more generalist ability .

CONCLUSIONS
our study detected numerous genetic factors likely important in s. agalactiae’s adaptation to the bovine environment. in particular, the acquisition of lac. <dig> and the ability to efficiently metabolize lactose appears to have been a major adaptation. we provide convincing evidence supporting lgt as the mechanism responsible for this adaptation, and rather than being a single evolutionary event, it appears to have occurred multiple times, with all streptococcus species known to be major causes of mastitis identified as possible donors. this process has resulted in genetically divergent types of lac. <dig> within s. agalatiae warranting further investigation into the possible affects this has on survivability and the propensity to cause mastitis. other factors such as up regulation of genes involved in copper homeostasis, and metabolism of purine, pyrimidine, glycerol and glucose were also specific to bovine adapted strains. although somewhat speculative without further functional studies, the up regulation of a gnat gene during growth in milk that may impart antibiotic resistance, was of particular interest, as it hinted at an adaptation to the use of antibiotics within this environment. other mastitis causing pathogens are less responsive to antibiotics  <cit>  and the evidence provided here and elsewhere, for lgt between s. agalactiae and these species, highlights the potential for further development and spread of antibiotic resistance.
