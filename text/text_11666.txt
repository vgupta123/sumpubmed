BACKGROUND
iron and zinc are recognized as important micronutrients for bacteria, but excess of iron can catalyze the fenton reactions, resulting in formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . similarly, an excess of zinc ions can also trigger the formation of hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . besides hydroxyl radicals, reactive oxygen species  such as superoxide radical and h2o <dig> are inevitably generated as byproducts of aerobic metabolism in bacteria  <cit> . additionally, during infection, ros can be generated by the innate immune system <cit> . ros can cause damage to many macromolecules including dna, proteins and lipids  <cit> . it is clear that oxidative stress and metal homeostasis are closely related. however, bacteria have evolved efficient mechanisms to maintain metal ion homeostasis and protect themselves from oxidative damage  <cit> .

fur family proteins are present widely in bacteria and play crucial roles in cellular processes. this family contains more than six different proteins. they are the sensors of iron   <cit>  <cit> , zinc   <cit> , manganese  <cit>  and nickel   <cit> , and the peroxide regulon repressor   <cit> . in the gram-negative escherichia coli, there are two fur family proteins fur and zur. in contrast, there are three fur-like proteins  in many gram-positive bacteria such as bacillus subtilisclostridium acetobutylicum and staphylococcus aureus. in b. subtilis, fur regulates iron uptake and siderophore biosynthesis; zur regulates two abc zinc transporters; and perr regulates the oxidative stress response  <cit> .

streptococcus suis is economically a very important gram-positive and facultative anaerobic bacterium that causes severe diseases in pigs and humans. as an emerging zoonotic pathogen, s. suis serotype  <dig> has become the predominant causative agent of adult human meningitis in vietnam and hong kong  <cit> . two large outbreaks of human infections were reported in china in  <dig> and  <dig>  resulting in  <dig> infections and  <dig> deaths  <cit> . like other bacterial pathogens, s. suis may also encounter both oxidative stress and metal starvation during infection. thus, the regulation on the responses to oxidative stress and metal starvation by fur-like proteins could be particularly important for s. suis survival in vivo and pathogenesis. however, only a single gene encoding a fur-like protein has been found in each sequenced genome of s. suis, even in the genomes of most species of the genus streptococcus. for example, the single fur-like protein is encoded by ssu05_ <dig> in s. suis serotype  <dig> strain 05zyh <dig> . this protein has been defined as a zinc uptake regulator   <cit> , as well as an iron uptake regulator  in s. suis <cit> , but the research on its function in oxidative stress response is limited, whereas its homolog in streptococcus pyogenes has been demonstrated to be a peroxide regulon repressor perr  <cit> . in this study, the role of this fur-like protein in peroxide resistance was confirmed in s. suis serotype  <dig>  therefore, we renamed this protein as perr. at the same time, two target operons, dpr  and metniq , were identified and proved to play important roles in oxidative stress response.

RESULTS
identification of a fur-like protein in s. suis and other streptococci
in the genome of 05zyh <dig> , the fur-like protein encoded by ssu05_ <dig> had been first identified as a zur  <cit> , and we found that ssu05_ <dig> is the sole gene encoding a fur-like protein in s. suis 05zyh <dig>  the ssu05_ <dig> protein consisted of  <dig> amino acids and contained a dna-binding motif . to identify the fur-like proteins in other streptococci, a blast homology search using the sequence of ssu05_ <dig> was performed among the sequenced genomes of the members of genus streptococcus. all streptococci had a single conserved fur-like protein except that no fur-like protein was found in streptococcus pneumoniae. all the fur-like proteins in streptococci and their homologs  in b. subtiliss. aureus and c. acetobutylicum were used for cluster analysis, the result showed that the fur-like proteins in streptococci clustered in the perr group . furthermore, through sequence analysis, the key amino acid residues of perr for h2o <dig> response and metal ions binding were highly conserved in ssu05_ <dig> protein   <cit> . consequently, we named the single fur-like protein in s. suis as perr.

roles of perr in h2o <dig> resistance in s. suis
our sequence analysis suggested that perr might be involved in the oxidative stress response in s. suis, and therefore we constructed a perr knockout strain  and a functional complementing strain . the growth of the wild-type, mutant and complementary strains showed no obvious difference in tsb medium with 5% newborn bovine serum .

to characterize the roles of perr in the susceptibility of s. suis to peroxide stress, the sensitivity of the wild-type strain sc- <dig>  mutant strain Δperr and complementing strain cΔperr to h2o <dig> was compared using an inhibition zone assay. as shown in figure 2a, the strains sc- <dig> and cΔperr  exhibited larger inhibition zones than the Δperr strain  when 4 μl of 1 m h2o <dig> was used. to determine further the difference in h2o <dig> sensitivity, quantitative analysis was performed. as shown in figure 2b, after h2o <dig>  treatment, the perr mutant strain showed a higher survival rate than the wild type. the survival rate of the complementary strain cΔperr was similar to that of the wild-type strain. these results indicated that inactivating s. suis perr led to reduced sensitivity to h2o <dig> 

transcriptional regulation by perr in s. suis
perr has been recognized as an important regulator in bacteria. in order to identify members of the perr regulon in s. suis, according to the consensus sequence of the perr-box in s. pyogenes and b. subtilis   <cit> , we screened for putative perr-boxes in the − <dig> to + <dig> sequences of all the genes/operons in the s. suis 05zyh <dig> genome.  <dig> predicted binding sites and  <dig> supposed target genes and operons were identified. the transcriptional levels of all  <dig> supposed target genes and operons  containing prospective perr-box in the promoters were compared between the strains sc- <dig> and Δperr by real-time rt-pcr . only three genes dpr , rela  and metq  were significantly upregulated  in Δperr . electrophoretic mobility shift assay  showed that the his-tagged recombinant perr protein could bind to the promoters of dpr and metqin, but not to those of relapmta and gida  . these results suggest that the dpr gene and metqin operon were directly regulated by perr. the perr boxes in the promoters of dpr and metqin are shown in figure 3c. to confirm regulation by perr in s. suis, a transcriptional reporter plasmid pset4s:pdpr-egfp was inserted into the genomes of strains sc- <dig> and Δperr. when cultured in tsb with 5% newborn bovine serum, stronger green fluorescence was observed in strain Δperr:egfp compared to sc-19:egfp by fluorescence microscopy. the mean fluorescence intensity  was measured by flow cytometry .

the effects of h2o <dig> on the transcriptional regulation were tested. bacteria were stimulated by 10 μm h2o <dig> for 10 min, the expression levels of dpr and metqin were analyzed by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure 4a, dpr and metqin was obviously induced in sc- <dig> but not in Δperr . then, the egfp reporter strains were used, the mfi of strains sc-19:egfp and Δperr:egfp in chemical defined medium  was measured. as shown in figure 4b, for the strain sc-19:egfp, growth in medium with 50 μm zinc and 50 μm manganese led to a low green fluorescence level, and no obvious induction by h2o <dig>  could be detected. in contrast, when grown in medium with 50 μm zinc and 50 μm iron, sc-19:egfp expressed a relatively high level of egfp, and the mfi was about two-fold higher after induction by h2o <dig> for 1 h. the mfi of strain Δperr:egfp was high and had no significant change in each condition. these results suggest that perr regulated the target operons by binding to the promoter region, and the derepression was induced by h2o <dig> and influenced by metal ions.

roles of dpr in h2o <dig> resistance in s. suis
h2o <dig> sensitivity analysis suggested that perr was involved in oxidative stress response and we have found that dpr was directly regulated by perr in s. suis. dpr encodes a peroxide resistance protein, previous study has found that dpr mutant was highly sensitive to h2o <dig> <cit> . to test the role of dpr in h2o <dig> resistance, the dpr gene was inactivated in strains sc- <dig> and Δperr. the resultant mutant strains Δdpr and ΔperrΔdpr were subjected to the h2o <dig> sensitivity assay. both dpr mutant strains exhibited <1% survival after incubation with 10 mm h2o <dig> . inactivation of dpr led to near loss of h2o <dig> defensive capability in both Δdpr and ΔperrΔdpr strains. however, there was no obvious difference in the survival rate between Δdpr and ΔperrΔdpr, suggesting that the increased h2o <dig> resistance of the perr mutant probably results of the derepression of dpr.

role of methionine in h2o <dig> resistance in s. suis
expression of the methionine abc transporter metqin was upregulated in the Δperr, therefore, methionine uptake may have been increased in the mutant. to verify this hypothesis, the methionine utilization by strains sc- <dig> and Δperr was investigated by measuring the reduced amount of methionine in the cdm. there was no obvious different in the growth rate of strains sc- <dig> and Δperr, but the amount of methionine utilization in the mutant was increased by  <dig> % compared to the wild type in cells grown to late-log phase . these data indicated that the derepression of metqin led to increased accumulation of methionine in strain Δperr.

to investigate the role of methionine in oxidative stress, the h2o <dig> sensitivity of strains in cdm with different concentrations of methionine was tested. as shown in figure 5b, strain sc- <dig> showed the lowest survival rate in cdm lacking methionine, and the survival rates were increased when methionine was added. the same phenomenon was observed in strain Δperr, except that Δperr showed higher survival rates at every methionine concentration. these results indicated that the resistance to h2o <dig> in s. suis was related to methionine.

role of perr in pathogenicity in s. suis
an experimental infection model in mice was designed to assess the role of perr in pathogenicity. in the wild-type group, all of the mice presented severe clinical signs associated with septicemia and septic shock during the first day post-infection and then died from septicemia in this group. in contrast, the mice in the Δperr group presented with partial clinical signs, three of eight infected mice survived during  <dig> dpi, and finally one mouse was alive at  <dig> dpi. thus, as previously report  <cit> , the mutant strain Δperr was slightly attenuated in pathogenicity according to survival rate and clinical signs.

to investigate the reason of the reduced pathogenicity in perr mutant, mice were intraperitoneally infected with the same dose of sc- <dig> and Δperr. bacteria were recovered from blood, lung, brain and spleen. at  <dig> dpi, the numbers of Δperr harvested from blood and each tissue were significantly decreased compared to those of the wild-type strain. at  <dig> dpi, the Δperr was nearly cleared from mice, but the wild-type strain could still be recovered . statistical significance of the difference was determined by student t-test. the result suggested that the viability of perr mutant was reduced in the host.

discussion
as a pathogen, s. suis may encounter both oxidative stress and metal starvation during infection. fur family proteins play important roles in metal ion homeostasis and oxidative stress responses in many bacteria. a single fur-like protein was identified in s. suis, and in the rest of the genus streptococcus, except for s. pneumoniae. the fur-like protein in s. suis has been shown to regulate the zinc and iron uptake genes  <cit> . in our study, the function of this fur-like protein in oxidative stress response was characterized. we suggested that, in addition to its role in regulating zinc and iron uptakes, another important role of this fur-like protein was to act as an oxidative stress response regulator in s. suis, and reannotated this fur-like protein as perr.

a recent research has found that the fur  knock-out mutant in s. suis serotype  <dig> strain p1/ <dig> was more sensitive to h2o <dig> <cit> . however, in our study, an opposite result was observed, that deletion of perr in s. suis serotype  <dig> strain sc- <dig> resulted in increased resistance to h2o <dig>  deletion of perr has been found to cause a high resistance ability to h2o <dig> in b. subtilis <cit> , c. acetobutylicum <cit> s. aureus <cit> , and in the single fur containing s. pyogenes <cit> , and these results accord with our test in s. suis.

as a negative regulator, the high resistance to h2o <dig> in perr mutant may result from derepression of the perr regulon. in many bacteria, one important member of perr regulon for h2o <dig> resistance is catalase  <cit> . however, all lactic acid bacteria including s. suis lack catalase, it is interesting to identify other potential perr targets for h2o <dig> resistance in s. suis. qrt-pcr and emsa tests showed that dpr and metqin were directly regulated by perr, and the expression of dpr and metqin could be induced rapidly by physiological level of h2o <dig>  these results suggested that one mechanism for oxidative stress response by perr was derepression of perr targets dpr and metqin. previous study found that feoab was regulated by fur  in s. suis p1/ <dig> strain  <cit> , however, in our study the perr protein could not bind with feoab promoter as well as we did not found a perr-box in the promoter region , suggesting that it is an indirectly regulation.

dps family proteins have been identified in many bacteria including s. suis. in b. subtilis and s. pyogenes, the dps homolog mrga is derepressed when h2o <dig> oxidizes perr  <cit> . usually, if the fe2+ is present, h2o <dig> could be nonenzymatically cleaved into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals by fenton reaction . however, dpr can prevent the fenton-reaction by storing iron and converting fe2+ to fe3+-mineral  in a ferroxidase dependent way, resulting in avoiding formation of hydroxyl radicals. in addition, dpr can bind dna to protect dna from oxidative damage in most bacteria but not in s. suis <cit> . according with previous study, h2o <dig> resistance was markedly reduced in Δdpr <cit> . in our experiment, we found that the double mutant ΔperrΔdpr was also highly sensitive to h2o <dig> . although other perr targets might be derepressed in Δperr, h2o <dig> resistance ability was not obviously increased. it suggested that, in catalase negative s. suis, dpr was especially crucial for h2o <dig> resistance, and the main reason for increased h2o <dig> resistance in Δperr was derepression of dpr.

all amino acid residues of protein are susceptible to oxidative stress. however, methionine sulfoxide can be reduced to methionine by methionine sulfoxide reductase . during this reaction, methionine helps the organisms to reduce h2o <dig> to h2o  + h2o; met + th2 → met + th + h2o)  <cit> . in most species, such as humans, mice, yeast and bacteria, the cyclic oxidation and reduction of methionine residue plays an important role in defense against oxidative stress  <cit> . in our study, the metniq operon was found to be regulated by perr. however, the metniq operon is repressed via the s-box system in b. subtilis and in some other bacteria  <cit> . in contrast, we did not find the s-box in the promoter of metniq operon in s. suis, but it was replaced by a perr-box . a recent report also found that metniq operon was regulated by perr in s. pyogenes via microarray assay  <cit> . it seems, that metqin is negatively regulated by fur-like protein, is special in the streptococci. we found that metqin operon could be induced by h2o <dig> in sc- <dig>  and in metqin derepressed Δperr, methionine utilization was increased. additionally, methionine concentration was found to be related to h2o <dig> resistance. these results suggested that, via controlling the methionine transport, methionine uptake could be regulated by perr. thus, oxidative stress response was indirectly affected.

metal ions level played an important role in oxidative stress response, especially iron level. in our study, using the transcriptional reporter system, we found that perr represses the regulon by binding to the promoters, and derepression of the regulon could be induced by h2o <dig> when abundant fe2+ was added. in b. subtilis, the regulatory mechanism of perr has been well studied from the standpoint of its structure, revealing that perr is a dimeric zinc protein with a regulatory site that coordinates either fe2+ or mn2+. perr can bind fe2+ or mn2+ and then repress transcription of its targets, however fe2+ can catalyze the oxidation of key histidine in perr, leading to inactivation of perr  <cit> . perr in s. suis may have a similar regulatory mechanism to that of b. subtilis perr. according to our results and previous studies, we summarized the putative perr mediated oxidative stress response pathway in s. suis and showed it in figure  <dig> 

perr has been found to be necessary for full virulence of s. pyogenes <cit> . our investigation found that the pathogenicity of perr mutant strain was attenuated. the decreased pathogenicity might be due to the reduced viability of mutant in the host. the fact that the viable number of mutant recovered from mice was much less than that of the wild-type, also supported this explanation. it seems that deletion of perr may lead to inappropriate expression of perr-regulated genes and affect the normal growth. for example, knockout of perr led to iron starvation and the growth was inhibited in b. subtilis <cit> . it was reported that, because dpr could store iron, the cytosolic iron would be efficiently scavenged when dpr was ectopic overexpressing in s. suis <cit> . it suggested that in Δperr, the derepressed dpr would lead to cytosolic iron starvation and affect the growth.

CONCLUSIONS
these data strongly suggest that the fur-like protein perr regulates the oxidative stress response in s. suis. two members of perr regulon dpr and metqin were identified in s. suis, dpr played a crucial role in h2o <dig> resistance and metqin might indirectly affect the h2o <dig> resistance by controlling the methionine uptake. mice infection model showed that the pathogenicity of perr mutant strain was attenuated.
