BACKGROUND
as a relatively “new” virus, only identified in  <dig>  <cit>  and first cultured successfully in  <dig>  <cit> , there is still much that is unknown about the hepatitis c virus  and this has hindered the development of an effective vaccine. the following are some of the challenges to successful hcv vaccine design.

1) the virus is highly mutable and exists as a quasispecies within the host and genotypes cluster geographically.

2) host cell responses to hcv infection are poorly defined and inconsistent among infected individuals.cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses are also not cross-protective to heterologous genotypes  <cit>  and, to date, there is no immunodominant epitope that is consistently found in hcv-positive individuals  <cit> .

3) humans are the only natural host of hcv, and suitable laboratory models have only been developed recently. the chimpanzee has been infected in the laboratory  <cit> , but studies using this model are expensive and limited. the mouse model for viral pathogenesis studies promises a more practical and plausible alternative  <cit> .

epitope-based vaccines promote an immune response by presenting immunogenic peptides  bound to major histocompatibility  molecules  to the t cell receptor. class ii- proteins are presented to t helper cells by antigen presenting cells  with the aid of the cd <dig> co-receptor whereas class i- proteins are presented by the infected target cell to cytotoxic t cells with the aid of the cd <dig> co-receptor. the t helper response is important in directing and activating the immune response, including the effectiveness of cd8+ t cells  <cit> .an effective vaccine must be capable of inducing and maintaining powerful cd <dig> and cd <dig> t-cell immunity in the greatest proportion of its target population.

both hcv genotype and hla allele frequency are distributed geographically. viral genotype, host genetic background  <cit>  and hla class i-  <cit>  and class ii- alleles  <cit>  are associated with both hcv disease progression and sustained response to therapy  <cit> . south africa has diverse ethnic groups, hence a high diversity of hla genetic background  <cit> . black africans, including the well-studied zulu ethnic group, constitute the majority  population in the country . other major population groups include caucasians  and those of mixed race . the predominant hcv genotype in south africa is genotype 5a. this little studied genotype accounts for 57% of the hcv infections in south africa with the very well studied genotype  <dig> accounting for 23%  <cit> . in comparison, genotype  <dig> accounts for 70% of hcv infections in usa  <cit> . hence, most peptide-based vaccines studies concentrate mainly on hcv genotype  <dig> epitopes restricted by hla-a* <dig> which is the most common hla allele in populations of european/caucasian descent .

the binding of the epitope to the hla-molecule is a highly selective process as only  <dig> in 40– <dig> peptides would bind to the hla class i- or ii- allele with high affinity to produce an efficient immune response  <cit> . computer prediction servers have made it possible to identify potentially strong peptide binders to hla molecules that can then be tested in vitro and in vivo as putative epitopes for peptide-based vaccines. this is a cost- and time-saving exercise as it is expensive and laborious to synthesize and test several 9-mer or overlapping peptides over long target antigens. there are various computational prediction servers available and their sensitivity is constantly improving, including more than  <dig> prediction servers to identify hla-ii binding peptides  <cit> .

we hypothesize that putative vaccines based on restriction by the hla-a* <dig> allele and genotype  <dig> sequences will not perform optimally in south africa. the aim of the study was, therefore, to investigate the heterogeneity of well studied hcv epitope sequences across hcv genotypes  and assess their immunogenicity against prevalent local hla-types in order to assess vaccine efficacy and population coverage in the ethnically diverse south african population. this descriptive study used web-accessible prediction servers to predict epitope binding of recently published putative epitopes for hcv vaccines against the south african hla background. the main objectives of the study were:

1) to characterise the variation of selected published immunogenic epitopes within popular target antigens, focusing on south african genotype 5a data.

2) to predict the immunogenicity of these epitopes and their variants against the background of prevalent alleles in the south african target population.

RESULTS
degree of conservation between epitopes
the weblogo consensus was generated from individual alignments of all available sequence data of hcv genotypes . thus, seven web logos were generated for each of the  <dig> chosen class i-  and class ii-  epitopes . the epitopes chosen for this study are well characterized and referenced . ns4b2422- <dig> has only one reference  but it is also the only one that has a different restriction allele i.e. b <dig>  the hcv consensus was derived from the  <dig> generated weblogos and the percentage conservation within each genotype over the epitope region was calculated as described in the methods .


^class ii- restricted epitopes in the core region are overlapping sequences.

the comparative variability of the epitope sequences within and across the different genotypes is shown in table  <dig>  genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> have the lowest mean intra-genotype scores for both class i- and ii- epitope sequences, indicating a greater variation among subtypes within these genotypes. there is only one subtype within genotype  <dig> so not surprisingly the epitope sequences, including our sequences, from subtype 5a are relatively conserved. because a large proportion of sequences on the database belong to genotype 1a or 1b, the consensus sequences that were generated is mostly representative of genotype  <dig> sequences. mean conservation scores of genotype  <dig> sequences are the same as that of genotype  <dig> for class i-  and similar for class ii- . the intra-genotype variation was not statistically significant for any of the epitopes selected. two class i- epitopes  and four of the six class ii-epitopes had the highest average conservation scores of more than 80% . published class ii-restricted epitopes were, in general, better conserved than the class i- epitopes, both within and across the genotypes .some epitopes were well conserved  while others  were highly variable .

most epitopes were identified using genotype 1a sequences, hence it follows that the epitope sequences had greater identity with genotype  <dig>  genotype  <dig> epitope sequences showed a consistently high degree of correspondence with the consensus but since this genotype was represented by the smallest data set, this may not be a true reflection of variation within the genotype. genotype  <dig> showed the most variability, with a mean conservation score of  <dig> % within this genotype, which is to be expected since this genotype is known to be highly variable .

major hla alleles
the most common hla-a, -b and –c alleles in the south african black population are classified into supertypes as described by  <cit> . for example, and as seen in table  <dig>  the a <dig> supertype includes the a*02: <dig> and a*68: <dig> alleles. the a*30: <dig> allele belongs to the supertype a01a <dig>  this study predicted binding to  <dig> hla class i- alleles in  <dig> supertypes and  <dig> class ii- hla-dr alleles predominant in the south african population.

hla-a and –b class i- restricted binding
binding predictions of epitopes and their variants for all available hla alleles prevalent in the south african population are shown in table  <dig> five of the six hla class i-published epitopes  have been reported to be hla-a* <dig> restricted . three of the five published hla-a* <dig> restricted epitopes bound the a*02: <dig> allele as expected .

predictions for the different alleles were in agreement regardless of the programme or algorithm used  with two exceptions, binding of the  <dig> amino acid epitopes of ns4b1807- <dig> llfnilggwv and the hla-b*27: <dig> binding predictions. the original  <dig> amino acid ns4b1807-1816genotype  <dig> epitope llfnilggwv  predicted to bind with high affinity  to hla-a*02: <dig>  neither iedb ann nor propred i predicted binding between this allele and the two possible  <dig> mer epitopes, llfnilggw and lfnilggwv while syfpeithi predicted binding of 18% and 14%, respectively. one of the shortcomings of iedb ann is that it can only predict binding peptides that are of the same length as those in the training set. for this reason, all peptides were re-analysed with all the alleles of interest using the “any length” parameter for epitope length. no other changes were observed to binding predictions listed in table  <dig> using these parameters.

the second exception observed was the failure of iedb ann to predict binding between any of the epitopes  and hla-b*27: <dig> which syfpeithi and/or propred i scored. there was no data supporting restriction of these particular peptides by b*27: <dig> in the iedb epitopes database. both syfpeithi and propred i use peptide motifs and amino acid matrix based prediction. the following scores using x--x  could explain the scoring of these two packages for ns31406-1415epitopes klvalgina, klsglgina  and variants klqdctmlv and klrdctllv . syfpeithi uses x--x -. however, one would expect lower predictions for ns5b2422- <dig> epitopes msyswtgal and msytwtgal  since only the carboxyl anchor is present but this was not the case.

ns31073- <dig>  ns4b1851- <dig> and ns5b2727- <dig> bound with high affinity to a*02: <dig> allele, regardless of genotypic variation . all variants tested for both ns5b2727-2735and ns4b1851- <dig> were predicted to bind the a*02: <dig> allele with equal strength . high and intermediate binding affinities over all variants was also observed for ns31073- <dig> and ns4b1851- <dig> with allele a*68: <dig> , of the a <dig> supertype.

two of the variants, sisgvlwtv  and tvggvmwtv  had changes from the wild type n  in position  <dig> but none of the variants had changes in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, when all possible alanine exchange peptides were placed into iedb ann, the output scores reflected the experimental binding changes for all of the alanine exchange peptides with the exception of the total abrogation of signal for substitutions in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .of note, while consistent binding was observed across the supertype a <dig> for all of the variants of the a* <dig> restricted epitope ns31073- <dig>  epitopes of genotypes  <dig>  3a and 5a  were found to be intermediate binders .

the genotype 4a and 5a variants of the hla-a* <dig> restricted epitope ns5b2727-2735displayed some level of promiscuity as these were predicted to bind with high affinity to the a01a <dig> supertype allele, a*30: <dig> , while the genotype 1b variant had low affinity with this allele  and the original genotype 1a peptide was not predicted to bind at all. the original peptide and one of the two of three variants of the published b*15-restricted ns5b2422- <dig> epitope displayed intermediate binding ic <dig> nm values of  <dig> and  <dig> . this epitope showed the highest cross-reactivity across the supertypes with both the original epitope and one of the genotype 5a variants binding very strongly to a*68: <dig>  and b*35: <dig> .

of the  <dig> class i- epitopes used in this study, only two epitope variants were found to be promiscuous: msytwtgal  and klrdctllv .in a preliminary attempt to identify conserved epitopes showing greater promiscuity across supertypes, strings of epitopes  of the ns <dig> protein were placed into the iedb server. table  <dig> indicates that five of the eight epitopes were predicted to be promiscuous, binding with high  and intermediate  affinities to two or more supertypes: ltgptplly , flstatqtf , itystygkf , kvlvlnpsv , rakapppsw . of the five epitopes above, three were conserved among genotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , itystygkf, kvlvlnpsv and rakapppsw.

class ii- alleles
propred ii was used to predict binding of the longer class ii- epitopes. before calculating the predicted binding, the programme identifies all overlapping nine amino acid peptides within the input polypeptide. a predicted binding score is given as a percentage of the maximum possible binding  with the chosen allele . for example, core17- <dig>  rrpqdvkfpgggqivggvyllprrgp, returned two 9-mer peptides, vyllprrgp and vggvyllpr, which scored similarly for alleles hla-drb1*03: <dig> and hla-drb1*15: <dig> . however, in the context of drb1*13: <dig>  vyllprrgp had a much higher percentage binding score  than its flanking sequence vggvyllpr . note that no class ii- epitopes were predicted in the first  <dig> amino acids of core17- <dig>  the core17- <dig> epitope was well conserved across the genotypes , but was not predicted to bind with hla-drb1*01: <dig>  hla-drb1*01: <dig> or hla-drb1*04: <dig> and only vggvyllpr was predicted to bind with hla-drb1*07: <dig> .

the most promiscuous class ii-epitope was also the best conserved epitope, ns31248- <dig>  specifically the region 1252– <dig> lvlnpsvaa, bound all eight of the alleles tested and was the only epitope to bind hla-drb1*04: <dig> the allele hla-drb1*15: <dig> was predicted to bind with all but five of the  <dig> peptides output by the program . the highest percentage of optimal binding  was predicted between peptide livypdlgv within ns5b2571- <dig> and the hla-drb1*15: <dig> allele.this immunogenic epitope is one of three variants common to genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> 

the ns31248- <dig> epitope ykvlvlnps was well conserved among genotypes and bound to three drb1* alleles . interestingly, the epitope kvlvlnpsv, also conserved, bound to two class i- supertypes . another epitope that is a class i- and ii- binder is fnilggwva .

coverage calculations
the predicted binding scores of published epitopes  were used to estimate population coverage. selected programme output  has been supplied as supplementary figures where indicated.

iedb population coverage
the published class i- and ii- epitopes had coverage of  <dig> %  in south african blacks and  <dig> %  in south african whites. corresponding figures when calculations included only the class i- epitopes were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . by choosing predominantly genotypes  <dig> and 5a epitopes  predicted to be immunogenic in south african blacks, the combined class i- and ii-coverage in blacks improved to  <dig> %  while coverage improved to  <dig> %  in the south african whites.

optitope population coverage
the optitope candidate epitopes were proposed whether the chosen population was “north american europeans” or europe  and results showed coverage of  <dig> % . alternatively, candidate epitopes were sought using the same hcv alignment data and choosing the zulu ethnic group  and coverage of  <dig> % was shown .

optitope epitopes and iedb population coverage
candidate epitopes chosen for “optimal” vaccines for caucasians and zulus, respectively, from the optitope analyses described above, were then tested using the south african white and black populations. local population data was placed into the iedb population coverage web application as before.

results indicated that south african blacks had a  <dig> % chance of responding to a putative european “optimal” vaccine while the same vaccine provided  <dig> % coverage in the population for which it was designed. the putative “optimal” vaccine for zulus provided coverage of  <dig> % in south african blacks with  <dig> % coverage in europeans .

discussion
hcv genotypes and host genetics vary geographically and yet proposed epitope vaccines are most often formulated based on genotype  <dig> peptide sequence data alone and their restriction confined to the alleles found predominantly in the caucasian population. this study assesses the efficacy of a putative epitope vaccine designed with this typical sequence bias when used in south african populations. the heterogeneity of epitope regions proposed for hcv vaccines was explored together with their predicted binding, and that of their variants, to hla alleles common in the south africa population.

there is a need to examine viral variation within known epitopes, and assess the prevalence and immunogenicity of the variants for relevant host alleles within the target population, before choosing epitopes for inclusion in an epitope vaccine. this study, therefore, focused on subtype 1a, 1b and 5a sequences as these were found to predominate in south africa  <cit> . this is the first time that south african genotype 5a data is being compared to well- studied epitope data of other genotypes. genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> have also been found in the south african population but genotype  <dig> is rare and, to date, genotype  <dig> has not been identified. in order to improve the representation of genotype 5a, all available sequence data was included in the alignments, including sequences from our own studies and those of  <cit>   and  <cit>  .

there are numerous epitopes meeting the inclusion criteria that could have been chosen for the study but a final subset was chosen so that it included well studied epitopes considered for multi-epitopic  <cit> , therapeutic  <cit> , minigene  <cit>  and dna polytope  <cit>  vaccines.genotype  <dig> is a well-studied genotype and considerably more sequences were available for the genotype  <dig> alignments. class i- and ii- epitope sequences of genotype 5a were found to be relatively conserved compared to some of the other genotypes, notably genotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genotype  <dig> is considered to be a relatively conserved genotype as to date, there is only one subtype of genotype  <dig> , compared to the highly intra-genotypically variable genotype  <dig> that partitions into  <dig> different subtypes, 6a-6v, considerably more than any of the other genotypes  <cit> .

there have been several studies which show a lack of cross-protection across the genotypes  <cit> . with regard to the ns31073-1081epitope, an extensively studied epitope, our study has predicted high and intermediate binding of variant sequences to a <dig> supertype, indicating a level of cross-reactivity for this epitope. the consensus at the position  <dig> of ns31073- <dig> was an isoleucine . the only other common amino acid in this anchor position was valine . valine was conserved at position  <dig> in all but the genotype 5a sequences where approximately one third of the sequences had a leucine  in this position. despite the fact that substitutions at p <dig> were conservative , affinity of this epitope was lowered. when alanine exchange peptides were used in in vitro assays  <cit> , substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the published ns31073- <dig> epitope abolished ifn-gamma production. changes at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> only partially reduced production and only positions  <dig> and  <dig> had no effect. even single amino acid exchanges at non-anchor sites can significantly limit the potential efficacy of a vaccine containing only the wild type peptide  <cit> .

 <cit>  identified distinct polymorphism profiles of genotypes 1a and 3a non-structural gene sequences. only  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphisms, observed to have significant hla association, were common to both genotypes  <cit> . the extent of genetic diversity can result in a distinct repertoire of hla-restricted viral epitopes for different genotypes. when we looked at consensus alignments of the chosen epitopes, we also observed this phenomenon. the consensus at each site of an epitope represents the amino acid best adapted to t cell responses across the host population  <cit> . a consequence of this is that escape of a mutant  can become the most dominant amino acid. when this happens, the polymorphism in the epitope, or negatope, as it is now called, is over-represented even in hosts not having the allele which drove the escape  <cit> .

one of the shortcomings of iedb ann is that it can only predict binding peptides that are of the same length as those in the training set. hence, the server will not pick up binding in longer epitopes if this is not specified  <cit> . however, by using older programs, such as syfpeithi and bimas that use peptide motifs and amino acid matrix based prediction  both of which are popular, updated and have relevance  <cit>  we were able to flag the longer epitopes and repeat the prediction in iedb ann for the  <dig> amino acid epitope.

epitopes which are well conserved and show good binding affinities to many hla alleles  are the best candidates for in vitro and/or in vivo testing. epitopes like ns4b1801-1820are particularly appealing since they contain substrings which act as class i- and class ii- alleles. while in silico planning has been found to greatly facilitate peptide design, not all peptides predicted in silico are optimally immunogenic in vivo <cit>  and it remains essential to test predicted peptides in vivo so as to ascertain that the needed t-cell response is elicited. numerous in silico studies have shown the value of using prediction programs to assess the efficiency of binding of putative epitopes to human alleles  <cit> . also,  <cit>  showed an increase in the use of in silico prediction studies with an improvement of epitope prediction programs available. of the published epitopes used in this study, only  <dig> class i-  and  <dig> class ii-  epitopes were found to be promiscuous using the prediction programs.

the ns <dig> protein is a large protein and has been shown to generate effective immune responses, which can resolve acute infection. this study looked across the ns <dig> protein to identify possible additional epitopes  that may be good binders to predominant hla-alleles in the south african population. the results of this search  which we have called, “newly predicted” ns <dig> epitopes were found to be well-conserved and bind to more than one hla class i- allele. three class i- epitope sequences were found to be highly conserved, particularly among genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  and were predicted to be strong binders to two or more supertypes. none of these “newly predicted” ns <dig> epitopes were found on the los alamos hcv immunology database . this exercise illustrates the usefulness of in silico studies to identify potential binders which will suit the target populations. in vivo studies will always be needed to confirm immunogenicity of these predicted peptides but this study has shown that in silico prediction can consider both host and viral variation, particularly in countries like south africa and egypt where genotypes other than genotype  <dig> predominate. in silico coverage calculations can not only identify promiscuous epitopes but also optimise the best cocktail for an effective multi-epitope vaccine. a recent in silico study identified  <dig> promiscuous hcv class i- and  <dig> class ii- epitopes that were predicted to bind to genotype 3a  <cit> . a string of  <dig> conserved and promiscuous immunodominant epitopes spanning  <dig> hiv- <dig> proteins produced an effective immunogen  <cit> ,  <dig> epitopes were found promiscuous to mhc class i- and ii- within e-coli  <dig> genome  <cit>  and  <dig> promiscuous epitopes were predicted within m. tuberculosis peptide  <cit> .

this study focused mainly on a <dig> –restricted epitopes and promiscuity was poor. however, immunogenic epitopes restricted to other alleles have been identified  <cit> . two b alleles, b <dig> and b <dig>  have been found to provide spontaneous control of hcv. neither of these alleles are prevalent in south african blacks  but preliminary investigations on ns5b  epitope, kskktpmgf , and genotype 5a variants rskktpmaf and kskkipmaf showed promiscuity to b*58: <dig>  b*15: <dig> and a*30: <dig>  indeed, this reiterates the need to look at viral variation and promiscuity as this is particularly important to vaccine design.

the following class i- and ii-restricted epitopes were selected from the original epitope set as likely to provide the best vaccine in the south african setting. this was based on binding affinities predicted for epitopes expected in the local population and binding to several supertypes recently recommended for inclusion in a vaccine which is optimal for both white and black south africans .

 <dig>  ns31073- <dig> both wild type genotype 1a cingvcwtv and genotype 1b cvngvcwtv because they are so well studied and show cross-reactivity within variants and across the supertype a <dig> 

 <dig>  ns4b1807- <dig>  because the 10-mer peptide is well conserved  and is immunogenic for both class i- and class ii- alleles.

 <dig>  ns5b2422- <dig>  both the original msyswtgal  and the genotype 5a variant msytwtgal as they cover the supertypes b <dig> as well as b <dig> and are also the best available b <dig> candidate in the recommended supertype set  <cit> .

 <dig>  ns5b2727-2735genotype 5a variant klrdctllv of the published epitope sequence glqdctmlv  <cit>  as it brings the most prevalent hla-a allele in the black population  and the most prevalent hcv genotype 5a in south africa into the mix.

 <dig>  the class ii-restricted epitopes ns31252- <dig> lvlnpsvaa  <cit>  which is conserved in all genotypes and also very promiscuous.

 <dig>  ns4b1809- <dig> which overlaps class i-restricted  <dig>  and is restricted by the  <dig> hla-dr alleles in the black population  and is also promiscuous.

 <dig>  core class ii- epitope vyllprrgp  included as it is the most reactive of the class ii- epitopes to hla drb1*13: <dig> 

the frequencies of the most common hla alleles in the south african caucasian and indian populations closely correlate with values from their respective populations globally. however, the frequencies of the most common hla-a and –b alleles in the south african black population are both heterogeneous and unique and quite distinct even from other black populations in western and northern africa  <cit> . many of the well studied published and “newly predicted” epitopes assessed in this study bound to a*68: <dig> . hla-a*68: <dig> was found  <dig> x more often in the black population than hla-a*68: <dig> .

there is a good correlation between immunogenicity and mhc class i- binding affinity  <cit> . based on this principle, several web-based resources are available which can assess the population coverage of putative epitope vaccines based on the predicted binding of the epitopes and their variants to chosen hla alleles relevant to the population being assessed. the predicted coverage of the original well studied class i- and ii-epitopes selected for this study to illustrate the drawbacks of a vaccine using south african host population frequencies was found to be  <dig> % and  <dig> % for blacks and whites, respectively .the optitope example highlighted the fact that the greater the knowledge of local viral variation and the immunogenicity of these variants together with accurate high resolution population allele frequencies allows the design of superior epitope vaccines with much better coverage for more groups within the target population. fine tuning the vaccine by using an optimal cocktail of genotype  <dig> and 5a epitopes raised the coverage of the vaccine to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, close to the 100% coverage predicted by  <cit>  in their study population.

CONCLUSIONS
in light of data generated in this study, epitope-based hcv vaccines should contain a mixture of epitope variants from all of the genotypes as wild-type genotype  <dig> response is not guaranteed to cross-protect against variants, even if the variant is restricted by the same allele. in addition the efficacy of a proposed epitope vaccine will differ between the major population groups. while coverage estimates can be made based on south african supertypes, cross-reaction of peptides with all supertype members is not universal. clearly for a set of epitopes to elicit a broad and potent immune response in the target population, viral variation and population genetics data should be factored into the algorithm particularly in the light of less-studied variants such a genotype 5a.

even where proposed epitopes are conserved, host differences will make the vaccine less effective in the south african setting. of the  <dig> published and well-characterised epitopes selected for this analysis  four class i- and three class ii-restricted epitopes would be beneficial in a multi-topic therapeutic vaccine for genotype 5a infection in our population. hepatitis c genotypes and high resolution population data is necessary when planning epitope vaccine design. while in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to confirm predicted immunogenic epitopes, in silico “reverse immunology” studies provide a sound basis with which to screen the many possible candidates. this study has shown that with the ease and usefulness of web-based sequence- and structure-based prediction servers, non-bioinformaticians can predict potential binders, without expensive computer hardware and programming knowledge.
