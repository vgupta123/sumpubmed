BACKGROUND
cryptosporidium and giardia are common parasitic protists that mainly cause enteric disease in humans and animals, including livestock, companion animals, and wildlife  <cit> . cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis result from fecal-oral transmission of oocysts or cysts, usually via water, food, or direct contact . livestock are often implicated in the disease cycle, and have been identified as the sources of several foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis .

to date,  <dig> cryptosporidium species and more than  <dig> genotypes have been recognized  <cit> . giardia duodenalis  is considered a multispecies complex, with at least eight distinct genetic groups or assemblages  based on protein or dna polymorphisms  <cit> . c. hominis, c. parvum, and g. duodenalis assemblages a and b are responsible for the majority of known human disease cases  <cit> . molecular epidemiological studies conducted in various countries suggest that cattle may be a significant reservoir of cryptosporidium and g. duodenalis, with potential for zoonotic transfer to humans  <cit> . cattle have been identified as the primary host for five cryptosporidium species , and with the exception of c. ryanae, all of these species can also cause infection in humans . for g. duodenalis, assemblage e is the most commonly reported genotype in cattle, followed by assemblages a and b  <cit> .

all known species and genotypes of both cryptosporidium and g. duodenalis have been reported worldwide in dairy and beef cattle. in contrast, very little is known about the prevalence and molecular characteristics of these pathogens in other members of the family bovidae, including yaks . there has been wide variation in the reported prevalence of cryptosporidium in fecal specimens from yaks in china using microscopy, enzyme immunoassays, and molecular tools for identification  . to date, six cryptosporidium species  and three genotypes, which have been identified in yaks  <cit> . however, g. duodenalis has not been reported in yaks. the objectives of the present study were to identify the species and/or genotypes of cryptosporidium and g. duodenalis infecting yaks in western china, and to clarify their public health significance.

RESULTS
the prevalence of cryptosporidium spp.
we have collected a total number of  <dig> fresh yak fecal samples from  <dig> locations in the central western region of china between 2009– <dig> to study the prevalence of cryptosporidium spp. and g. duodenalis by pcr and sequence analysis . among them,  <dig> specimens were cryptosporidium-positive by pcr amplification of the ssu rrna gene, with an overall prevalence of  <dig>  % . the prevalence of cryptosporidium from animals at the different collection sites ranged from 0– <dig>  %, with the highest prevalence in henan county . the most common species was c. parvum , followed by c. bovis  . results of the χ <dig> test showed that the differences in cryptosporidium prevalence was not statistically significant between sampling sites . however, the prevalence were significantly different between different age groups , with the higher prevalence  observed in animals < 1 year old than animals > 1 year old .fig.  <dig> specific locations at which specimens were collected in this study. ▲ study locations

to clarify the genetic relationships between the different subtypes, alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained tpi and gdh sequences with reference sequences were performed. the phylogenetic analysis of tpi sequences in this study with the reference subtypes ai, aii, subtypes e from cattle, goat and sheep demonstrated that subtypes e <dig>  and e <dig>  clustered with reference subtypes e, whereas subtypes e <dig>  and e <dig>  formed one separate cluster in assemblage e . alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained gdh sequences with reference sequences indicated the presence of only g. duodenalis subtype e from cattle and sheep, although the genetic variation was noticed within this subtype .fig.  <dig> dendrograms of giardia duodenalis based on nucleotide sequences of the triosephosphate isomerase   and glutamate dehydrogenase   gene. trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method based on genetic distance calculated by the kimura 2-parameter model, implemented in mega version  <dig> . bootstrap values > 50 % from  <dig>  replicates are shown on nodes. sequences from this study are marked by filled triangles



discussion
in the present study, the prevalence of cryptosporidium and g. duodenalis in yaks in western china was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of g. duodenalis in yaks. the prevalence of cryptosporidium species appears to vary widely depending on the geographic area in china. the overall cryptosporidium prevalence in this study was similar to that reported by qin et al.   <cit> , but was lower than the majority of reported rates  . infection rates are affected by many factors, including animal age, specimen size, diagnostic tests, management systems, seasons, and geographic area. therefore, it is difficult to compare prevalence data between studies. however, similar to our results, previous studies have shown that weaned calves and yearlings are more frequently infected with cryptosporidium than older yaks  <cit> . the overall g. duodenalis infection rate in this study is lower than rates recently reported in diary cattle in heilongjiang province  and henan province , china  <cit> . we also determined that there was a statistically significant difference in g. duodenalis infection rates between the different age groups. this finding was similar to previous reports regarding giardiasis as a common infection in immature animals .

to date, in addition to the four most common cryptosporidium species , c. ubiquitum and c. xiaoi have also been identified in a small number of yaks  <cit> . a previous study of cryptosporidium in yaks in qinghai province reported that c. bovis was the most common species , followed by c. parvum , and c. ryanae   <cit> . however, another study of cryptosporidium in yaks in the same area reported that c. bovis  and c. ryanae  were the most common species  <cit> , followed by c. andersoni , c. ubiquitum , and c. xiaoi , and that c. parvum was not detected. the results of these previous studies suggest that there is some variation in the dominant species causing cryptosporidiosis in yaks in qinghai province. of the four cryptosporidium-positive specimens in tianzhu county, three were identified as c. bovis and one was identified as c. andersoni, which is similar to a previous study showing that c. bovis is most prevalent in yaks  <cit> . in the present study, four cryptosporidium species were identified in yaks, with the most abundant species being c. parvum . this result differs from previous reported in yaks, whereas agrees with most previous reports in dairy calves found that c. parvum was the most common species, especially in preweaned dairy calves in the ningxia hui autonomous region, northwestern china .

of the four species identified, c. parvum is a major pathogen in humans, while c. ubiquitum has been identified in many human cases of cryptosporidiosis in the united kingdom, slovenia, the united states, canada, spain, and new zealand  <cit> . of the  <dig> cryptosporidium-positive isolates typed at the ssu rrna gene,  <dig> were c. parvum and one was c. ubiquitum. the c. ubiquitum isolate belonged to the family xiia subtype of gp <dig>  which has been detected in goats in china, as well as in humans and other animals in multiple countries . five of the c. parvum isolates were identified as belonging to the iid subtype, and differ from the iia subtype isolates found in yaks in qinghai province  <cit> . generally, of the  <dig> c. parvum subtypes , iia and iid are most commonly associated with zoonosis, while subtypes iic and iie are anthroponotic subtype families  <cit> . in general, the c. parvum subtypes found in china appear to be unique. while mi et al.  <cit>  reported c. parvum subtype iia isolates in yaks and goats, ye et al.  <cit>  reported subtype iic isolate in monkeys, all other c. parvum isolates from china have belonged to iid subtypes, including iida15g <dig> in rodents and cattle  <cit> , and iida19g <dig> in cattle, humans, goats, and urban wastewater  <cit> . subtype iida18g <dig> has previously been reported in calves in serbia and montenegro  <cit> , in lambs in spain  <cit> , and in humans in kuwait and the united kingdom  <cit> . in the present study, c. parvum subtype iida15g <dig> was the predominant subtype in yaks in western china, which further confirms the dominance of the c. parvum iida15g <dig> subtype in western china.

numerous molecular epidemiological data have shown that most cattle, sheep, and pigs are infected with the host-specific g. duodenalis assemblage e   <cit> . although g. duodenalis assemblage a and b isolates have been detected in cattle in china, most test-positive specimens have been confirmed as assemblage e  <cit> . a recent study reported that g. duodenalis assemblage e may cause intestinal lesions, leading to calf scours  <cit> . in the present study, sequence analyses indicated that the yaks were also infected with livestock-specific g. duodenalis assemblage e. the previous study in heilongjiang and henan provinces, china, found that the g. duodenalis assemblage e subtypes in cattle may represent the endemic genetic characteristics  <cit> . similar to previous reports, the current study also identified a high level of genetic polymorphism within assemblage e isolates in yaks by subtyping tpi and gdh sequences. more data from large-scale molecular epidemiological investigations focusing in assemblage e strains will clarify the geographical distribution of this pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
cryptosporidium parvum is the predominant species in yaks in the study area, which differs from previous reports in qinghai provinces that identified c. bovis as the most common species. the presence of c. parvum subtype iida15g <dig>  iida18g <dig>  and iida19g <dig> isolates further confirms the dominance of the c. parvum iid subtypes in china. these findings indicate that yaks may be a source of zoonotic cryptosporidium. this is the first report of g. duodenalis in yaks, and the obtained data provide useful information for further genotyping or subtyping studies of g. duodenalis. more studies are required to determine the dramatic geographic differences in the prevalence of zoonotic cryptosporidium and g. duodenalis in bovine animals in china.
