BACKGROUND
the process of myelination in the cns requires a remarkable morphological transformation by newly-formed oligodendrocytes, with processes contacting and extending along each axon before elaborating a myelin membrane to enwrap the axon multiple times to create a sheath. this differentiation step is tightly controlled, as indicated by the formation of processes each with sufficient membrane for a sheath thickness that has a precise relationship with final axon diameter  <cit> . in order to ensure that the precise amount of myelin is formed at the right developmental stage and in the correct place, a key component of oligodendrocyte behaviour during myelin formation must be the integration of multiple extrinsic signals at the axon surface along with intrinsic programmes, such as autonomous developmental timers of differentiation. these points of integration are therefore important for our understanding of myelination and may facilitate the development of strategies to promote remyelination.

one important group of candidate integrative molecules are the integrins, the cell surface receptors of extracellular matrix proteins. integrins comprise two transmembrane chains, termed α and β, with a ligand-binding site formed by the head domain of the two chains  <cit> . recent work has established that integrins exist in at least three different confirmations on the cell surface, each in a dynamic equilibrium with one another   <cit> . inactive integrins are folded over, have a low binding affinity for ligand and do not signal. primed integrins are straightened, and bind ligand with higher affinity as a result of shape changes within the head domain. activated integrins have bound ligand leading to receptor clustering, and have undergone a further shape change in the β chain leading to separation of the two cytoplasmic domains, thereby allowing formation of the signalling complex . since the change of shape can be transmitted across the membrane in either direction, activation can also be achieved by so called "inside-out" signals. these separate cytoplasmic domains and induce changes in the extracellular ligand-binding site that increase receptor affinity, leading to ligand binding, integrin clustering and signalling. as a result, integrin activation and formation of the signalling complex is regulated by the integration of both extrinsic ligand concentrations and the activity of  'inside out' signalling pathways.

oligodendrocytes express  <dig> integrins; αvβ <dig>  αvβ <dig>  αvβ <dig> and αvβ <dig> as well as α6β <dig>  <cit> . in cell culture, the αv integrins promote proliferation and migration  <cit> , while the laminin receptor, α6β <dig>  promotes differentiation  and survival  <cit> . in vivo, mice lacking α <dig> show increased apoptosis of newly-formed oligodendrocytes  <cit> . transplantation of cells expressing dominant-negative β <dig> integrins into focal demyelinated lesions in the adult rat reduced the extent of remyelination  <cit> . we therefore focused on α6β <dig> to examine the hypothesis that integrin activation provides a mechanism for the integration of extrinsic and intrinsic signals in oligodendrocyte differentiation. our goal was to test two key predictions of the hypothesis :  that either extracellular or intracellular signals regulating integrin activation can control oligodendrocyte morphology, and , that the effects of inhibition of one class of signals could be partially overcome by stimulation of the other, so demonstrating integration of signals by the integrin.

RESULTS
we have shown previously that laminin- <dig> substrates promote the formation of a differentiated morphological phenotype in oligodendrocytes, as evidenced by increased elaboration of processes and myelin sheets, and that α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits are found throughout the process network of oligodendrocytes  <cit> . to confirm that the change in phenotype was α6β <dig> integrin dependent , oligodendrocyte morphology was analyzed in the presence of the monoclonal antibody ha2/ <dig>  and rgd peptides . while confirming previous results with polyclonal anti-β <dig> antibody, we also found that the monoclonal ha2/ <dig> antibody blocked morphological differentiation on laminin- <dig> . in contrast, this antibody had little effect on fibronectin substrates, which promote process outgrowth but not myelin sheet formation and on which the rgd peptide was an effective inhibitor . since αvβ <dig> and α6β <dig> are the only β <dig> integrins expressed on oligodendrocytes, and because rgd peptides would be expected to block αvβ <dig>  we conclude that morphological differentiation leading to myelin sheet formation by oligodendrocytes on laminin- <dig> is α6β1-dependent.

to confirm that extracellular signals regulate oligodendrocyte morphology by activation of α6β <dig>  oligodendrocyte precursor cells were plated on increasing concentrations of laminin- <dig> and allowed to differentiate into oligodendrocytes. oligodendrocyte morphology was scored as having either simple  processes only, complex  processes or myelin sheets, reflecting the different changes associated with axon contact and sheath formation. increasing the laminin- <dig> coating concentration from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml resulted in a significantly greater degree of morphological differentiation . to exclude the possibility that this represented signalling by a second non-integrin receptor rather than α6β <dig> integrin, we also examined the effect of adding mn2+ to the tissue culture media. this divalent cation replaces the ca2+ normally present in the integrin ligand-binding domain and activates the integrin as a result of the conformational changes associated with the substitution. at low coating concentrations of laminin- <dig> , mn2+ significantly increased morphological differentiation, but had no effect at higher concentrations . this result would be expected if either high ecm concentrations  or mn2+ were sufficient to activate the oligodendrocyte α6β <dig> integrins effectively, while lower ecm concentrations only elicited partial activation. consequently, mn2+ promotes further differentiation at low ecm concentrations  but has no significant additive effect at the high ecm concentrations.

the effect of intracellular signalling pathways that regulate integrin activation was explored. both rt-pcr and western blotting studies confirmed the presence of r-ras in oligodendroglial cells , shown to regulate integrin activation in other cell types  <cit> . to manipulate r-ras signalling, transient transfections of primary oligodendrocyte precursor cell populations were used to express either wild-type  or mutant forms of r-ras  <cit> . expression of a constitutively active mutant form of r-ras  resulted in a dramatic increase in sheet formation by the oligodendrocytes . quantification revealed that this increase was significantly greater than that seen in cells expressing wild-type r-ras at the highest laminin- <dig> concentrations tested, with >80% of the cells expressing sheets at  <dig> μg/ml .

conversely, a dominant negative r-ras construct  reduced the degree of morphological differentiation seen in response to laminin- <dig> . when compared with cells expressing wild-type r-ras, the percentage of oligodendrocytes with a complex morphology was significantly reduced at laminin- <dig> concentrations above  <dig>  μg/ml, with the percentage exhibiting a simple morphology correspondingly increased . together with the data using the constitutively-active r-ras38v, these results point to the presence on the surface of the oligodendrocyte of a dynamic equilibrium between inactive and activated α6β <dig> that can be displaced in either direction by manipulation of r-ras signalling. moreover, when considered with the experiments using high laminin- <dig> coating concentrations and/or mn2+, they confirm our first prediction that either intracellular or extracellular cues regulating activation can control oligodendrocyte morphology.

to test the second prediction of the hypothesis that this equilibrium provides a mechanism for integrating intracellular and extracellular cues, we determined whether the effects of inhibiting activation by dominant negative r-ras  could be overcome by stimulating activation using mn2+ , as illustrated in fig 1c. mn2+ increased the extent of sheet formation, and decreased the percentage of cells with a simple morphology, in cells expressing the dominant negative r-ras construct at the two lower laminin concentrations tested . because mn2+ acts directly on the integrin ligand binding domain, we can conclude that the increase in sheet formation reflects a direct effect on the integrin and therefore on the equilibrium between inactive and active integrins, rather than via modulation of separate downstream signalling pathways.

discussion
these results show that the equilibrium between active and inactive integrins regulates oligodendrocyte morphology and myelin sheet formation. the balance of this equilibrium is determined by a combination of intracellular signals and extracellular ligand concentrations, with the two classes of signal integrated by individual integrin heterodimers. manipulation of the equilibrium provides one mechanism by which both the number of myelin sheaths formed by an individual oligodendrocyte, as well as their thickness, could be regulated during cns development.

to be relevant to myelination in vivo, our results require the presence of signals in the developing brain that can promote both outside-in and inside-out integrin signalling. we have shown previously that laminin α <dig>  is present on the surface of axons in embryonic brainstem at the time of myelination  <cit> , extending a previous report of laminin α <dig> expression by purkinje cells in the myelinating postnatal cerebellum  <cit> . binding of this laminin would provide an outside-in signal, as shown in the experiments using increasing laminin concentrations. a number of different extracellular signals might trigger the intracellular pathways that promote inside-out signalling. for example, our previous work has defined a role for growth factors and their receptors in integrin activation via "inside-out" signalling. in studies on cell proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursors, αvβ <dig> integrin was activated by pdgf  <cit> . activation of αvβ <dig> had been previously described in response to vegf in endothelial cells  <cit> , suggesting this might represent a general mechanism for integrin/growth factor interactions. two other extracellular signalling systems, eph/ephrins and semaphorins, have also been shown to alter integrin activation  <cit> . equally, the key intracellular components of the inside-out signalling pathway are present in oligodendrocytes. we have reported here that r-ras is expressed in oligodendroglia. recent work has shown that the interaction of the cytoskeletal protein talin with the β integrin cytoplasmic domain represents a final common pathway for the signals that promote activation  <cit> , and we have also found that talin is expressed in oligodendroglial cells  consistent with such a role in these cells.

these observations show that there are multiple potential signalling pathways that might regulate the equilibrium of active and inactive integrins. together with our present results, they support a model by which this equilibrium provides a dynamic means of integrating multiple signals to control the timing of myelination and the extent of myelin membrane. the model is based on the assumption that, under physiological conditions during normal development where growth factors are present in limiting concentrations, two classes of signals are required to generate sufficient numbers of activated integrins. so, for example, the laminin on the axon surface would be necessary for integrin signalling and myelination, but may not be sufficient without a further contribution to integrin activation from intracellular  signals. these "inside-out" signals could be generated by growth factor signalling, or alternatively from intracellular pathways driven by autonomous developmental clocks  <cit> , and would then effectively act as timers of myelination. equally, while these intracellular signals may initiate the myelination process, the amount of myelin formed  would then be determined by the concentration of extracellular ligand on the axon surface, with higher concentrations increasing integrin activation and so the amount of myelin produced. a precedent for wrap-number being determined by the concentration of axon-surface molecules is provided by the pns, where transmembrane isoforms of neuregulin regulate schwann cell myelination  <cit> . there is no evidence that laminins provide quantitative signals to the myelinating oligodendrocytes, but the observation that laminin- <dig> deficient dy/dy mutant mice show an increased g ratio  in the cns  <cit>  would be consistent with such signals, and further studies are required.

CONCLUSIONS
oligodendrocyte morphology is regulated at least in part by the balance of active and inactive integrins . such a model provides important insights into two aspects of oligodendrocyte biology. first, a single oligodendrocyte can myelinate multiple axons, and the thickness of each sheath  is independently regulated by the axon it ensheaths. clearly, this remarkable example of local control of cell-cell interactions cannot be regulated entirely by changes in transcription or translation initiated in the cell body. however, the control of integrin signalling by alterations of the equilibrium between active and inactive integrins provides a plausible mechanism by which integrin ligands on the axon could regulate membrane formation and morphological changes independently within each process. second, one hypothesis for the failure of remyelination in ms  is that the loss of the coordination between promyelinogenic signals, rather than the loss of any one specific factor, prevents repair  <cit> . the possibility that integrative signalling molecules such as integrins might provide targets for drug therapies designed to promote remyelination by activation and promotion of signalling in the absence of the usual upstream cues therefore requires further investigation.
