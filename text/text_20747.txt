BACKGROUND
bpi3v is commonly involved as a pathogen related to bovine respiratory disease  in cattle and preventing bovine parainfluenza  <dig> virus  infection in calves is challenging  <cit> . an ideal vaccine for the prevention of brd should limit viral infection to the upper respiratory tract , and prevent its spread to the lungs  <cit> . however, significant obstacles to effective vaccine design in neonates is observed due to the fact that young calves typically have circulating maternally-derived antibodies and their immune system is relatively immature. passively derived maternal antibodies can interfere with and inhibit the immune response to a vaccine in calves until their decline by 6 months of age  <cit> . in early neonatal life the calf’s immune system is skewed towards a th <dig> type immune response as a consequence of high levels of progesterone and th <dig> cytokines produced at the maternal-foetal interface . one way of reducing the effects of maternally derived antibody on vaccine response is to deliver the vaccine directly onto the nasal mucosa  <cit> , a route which favour the use of nanoparticles   <cit> .

to date, no research has been published examining the immune response of cattle to plga-nps encapsulating bpi3v antigens. however, there are studies investigating immune response to plga-nps in rodents  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the humoral and cellular immune responses of artificially reared dairy calves to intranasal immunisation with bpi3v vaccines, poly  nanoparticles encapsulating bpi3v nanoparticles , and a commercially available temperature-sensitive modified live bpi3v vaccine. the dairy calves used in this study were sero-positive to bpi3v at the beginning of the study. our hypothesis was to test if plga-bpi3v-nps could induce or enhance bpi3v specific antibodies in calves with pre-existing antibodies and how this immune response would compare with that induced by a commercially available intranasal vaccine.

mucus iga response
mucus iga levels in samples collected pre-immunisation were used as a covariate were not significantly different  between the four treatment groups . there was a significant  increase in virus-specific iga in the nasal mucus of the group  <dig> calves given the plga-bp13v-nps over the study period . this iga response increased gradually and significantly  following the ‘booster’ treatment, and continued to rise showing significant  variation from the other three groups. these higher mucus iga levels persisted until study completion  at 92 days. treatment with the commercial temperature-sensitive modified live virus vaccine  or the solubilised bpi3v , did not induce a statistically significant increase in mucus iga over the study period to the end of the experiment. as expected the group  <dig> negative controls did not demonstrate any significant change in iga levels over the study period.fig.  <dig> mucosal iga response to treatments; figure showing mean  mucosal iga response  to four intranasal treatments: commercial temperature-sensitive modified live virus intranasal vaccine; empty - negative control ; bpi3v -positive control ; and plga-bpi3v – nps vaccine under test. pre i = pre immunisation sampling, pi = post immunisation, pb = post booster, pe = post euthanasia 



serum-igg-response
serum igg levels in samples collected pre-immunisation were similar  between the four groups . there was a significant increase in serum igg concentration in groups  relative to the negative controls group  <dig>   over the study period. the igg response to plga-bpi3v-nps  increased  at 1 week post immunisation and increased gradually after the booster treatment and continued to rise showing a significant variation from the negative controls. calves given the commercial vaccine  showed a significant rise  in igg levels that continued to rise after the booster dose was administered. calves in group  <dig> given solubilised bpi3v proteins demonstrated a significant  rise in serum igg levels from 3 weeks post booster onwards. there was a positive correlation  between mucus iga and serum igg responses in all groups.fig.  <dig> serum igg response to treatments; figure showing mean  serum igg response  to four intranasal treatments: commercial temperature-sensitive modified live virus intranasal vaccine; empty - negative control ; bpi3v -positive control ; and plga-bpi3v – nps vaccine under test. pre i = pre immunisation sampling, pi = post immunisation, pb = post booster, pe = post euthanasia 



interferon -γ response
there was no significant change  in the release of ifn-γ from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in the four treatment groups over the duration of the study .

discussion
the present study investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses of dairy calves  inoculated with a plga-bpi3v-np vaccine and a commercial, temperature-sensitive modified live bpi3v vaccine. the calves given the plga-bpi3v-nps had significantly greater mucus iga responses, compared to the calves in the other three treatment groups following the booster treatment. this finding suggests an enhanced, more sustained mucosal-based immunological response to the candidate np vaccine in the face of pre-existing systemic bpi3v-specific igg and mucosal iga. it is also established that surface charge or zeta potential is a critical parameter in controlling the development of stable and more functional nanoparticles. it is shown that negatively charged surface nanoparticles minimise nonspecific cellular uptake resulting in greater localised specific response  <cit> . nanoparticles with negative zeta potential used in the current study could possibly be involved in greater localised bpi3v specific mucosal iga response. the mucosal iga response to plga-bpi3v-nps observed in the current study is specific to heat inactivated purified whole bpi3v virus. however, in the future it would be worth investigating the mucosal iga immune response towards more purified and concentrated immunodominant bpi3v antigens encapsulated in nps along with assessing iga response in combination with mucosal adjuvants.

the serum igg responses in the plga-bpi3v-nps treated calves were largely similar to those in the animals given the commercial vaccine, although they were lower between  <dig> and 5 weeks post-boosting. this could possibly be explained by the difference in the antigen release profiles from nps as described by kavanagh et al.  <cit>  and the non-replicating format of the bpi3v nps. the pre-existing bpi3v specific iga and igg antibodies in these animals were measured before the start of the study and the levels were largely similar in each of the treatment groups.

given that the production of antibody at mucosal surfaces tends to be transient  <cit> , the sustained presence of iga in mucus on the urt surfaces of the calves given the plga-bpi3v-nps suggests viral antigen presented in this form can result in a more sustained release of antigen over a longer period of time. mucosal immunisation has become an important strategy in vaccine design as this approach stimulates both mucosal and systemic immune responses whereas parenteral immunisation typically results in only a systemic response  <cit> . mucosal protection is particularly relevant in the context of respiratory pathogens where their major portal of entry is frequently the nasal mucosa  <cit> . mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue , an essential part of the mucosal immune system is the initial inductive site for nasal mucosal immunity. antigens are sampled from mucosal surfaces and naïve b- and t-lymphocytes are stimulated. malt structures  are the origin of lymphocyte migration to mucosal effector sites. lymphatics transport immune cells and antigens to regional lymph nodes that are inductive sites of mucosa and augment the immune responses  <cit> .

sustained release of soluble antigen, as is likely to occur from nps, has been shown to induce more robust immune responses than a larger single ‘spike’ or bolus of antigen given parenterally  <cit> . in terms of potentially further enhancing the immunological impact of our candidate nanoparticle vaccine, muco-adhesive agents and immune potentiators/modulators such as chitosan, cpg motifs and mpla could be used . muco-adhesive agents like chitosan has been shown to increase the penetration potential of the particles by increasing their adherence to mucosal membrane resulting in opening of tight junctions in the nasal mucosa.

no significant differences were detected in the concentrations of both nasal iga and serum igg specific bpi3v antibodies in any of the calves prior to study commencement and these ig profiles are typical of commercially sourced colostrum-fed dairy calves  <cit> . while these pre-existing antibodies may well have been maternally derived, the fact that the calves were not sampled until between  <dig> and 5 months of age means the possibility of prior exposure to bpi3v cannot be ruled out. however, there was no recent history of clinical respiratory disease on the farm where the calves were sourced.

the failure of the commercial vaccine to induce an anamnestic iga and igg antibody response instantly within a week of booster administration could possibly reflect the inhibitory effects of the circulating pre-existing antibodies as described previously  which resulted in complete vaccine failure after a single dose and started to show some response after the second dose. vangeel et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a single dose bpi3v vaccine did not provoke a significant rise in serum antibody levels in the presence of maternal antibodies and greenberg et al.  <cit>  reported that multiple doses of bpi3v vaccine were required to elicit protective immunity. calves given the commercial live vaccine demonstrated significant systemic igg responses 4– <dig> weeks after boosting. such a finding has previously been reported in vaccine studies in cattle where efficacy of intranasal and intramuscular live attenuated respiratory vaccines was investigated  <cit> .

the smaller systemic igg response in the plga-bpi3v-nps treated animals relative to the commercial vaccine-treated calves was perhaps not surprising given the likely reduced quantity of inactive virus antigen in the nps, relative to the ability of the live attenuated virus to replicate and therefore generate large quantities of antigen. in terms of pre-existing antibody interfering with vaccination, it is possible that pre-existing mucosal iga could also negatively impact on conventional or nps vaccines delivered onto mucocal surfaces. however as the nps encapsulate the antigen it may be more likely that there would be less interference of existing antibodies on the development of an immune response towards vaccine nps delivered by the aerosol route.

t-cells recognise antigenic peptides presented on mhc-encoded molecules and are fundamental to cmi. mhc-ii-restricted t-cells  are known to have a primary role in the production of macrophage activating cytokines such as ifn-γ. ifn-γ enhances the ability of infected cells and phagocytes to inhibit the activity of infecting organisms. interferon-γ can also be non-specifically produced by gamma-delta t and natural killer cells  <cit> . while some animals appeared to show ifn-γ responses at few occasions there were no consistent significant patterns correlating with vaccination. the antigen prepared for ifn-γ stimulation was a crude purified virus preparation and there could be other cellular antigens that may have caused some stimulation of cells to produce ifn-γ. interestingly, enhanced mucosal iga secretion has previously been linked to local ifn-γ production, where t cell products such as ifn-γ enhanced the translocation of large amounts of locally produced iga through epithelial cells into mucosal secretions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, calves administered intranasal plga-bpi3v-nps had significantly greater mucus iga responses, compared to calves in the other three treatment groups. the increase in mucosal iga response to nps demonstrate the potential of vaccine delivery system that facilitates the slow release of antigen from the protective coating of plga nps in the nasal mucosa. of primary importance is that the antigen is protected from the deteriorative effects of mucosal enzymes and, being in the nano size range, has the potential to cross the mucosal barrier. neutralizing respiratory viruses at the site of entry by eliciting local iga response is crucial in young claves with a developing immune system which are subjected to an intensive milk management feeding system. current study findings suggest an enhanced, sustained mucosal-based immunological response to the bpi3v nanoparticle vaccine in the face of pre-existing systemic igg, which are encouraging and potentially useful characteristics of a candidate vaccine. this more sustained local mucosal immunity induced by the candidate plga-bpi3v-nps vaccine has obvious potential if it translates into enhanced protective immunity in the face of virus outbreak.
