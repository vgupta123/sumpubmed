BACKGROUND
maize is one of the most widely grown crop plants worldwide and has become africa's most important staple food crop  <cit> . in regard of a growing world population and the increasing demand for food supply, a sustainable agriculture is of first priority. one topic concerning a sustainable maize cultivation is the improvement of its ability to cope with limiting nutrient supply.

as iron-sensitive crop maize asks for i) investigating the iron deficiency associated chlorosis that different maize genotypes display, ii) identifying the underlying genes and molecular processes, and iii) using this information to improve iron deficiency chlorosis of maize through breeding.

the processes that plants employ to efficiently access iron as well as genotypic variation of iron homeostasis itself are hitherto not completely understood. knowledge on natural variation of iron deficiency and the chlorosis response is crucial to improve growth of crops in marginal soils, where iron deficiency frequently limits growth. iron deficiencies are found mainly on calcareous soils  <cit>  but also develop in acid soils  <cit> . as iron is involved in the production of chlorophyll, deficiency is easily recognized by the occurrence of chlorosis symptoms, notably yellowish interveinal tissue on the younger upper leaves  <cit> . iron constitutes an indispensable plant nutrient and severe deficiencies cause leaves to turn completely yellow or almost white, which in turn strongly impairs plant growth and leads to high yield losses  <cit> . this furthermore, influences nutritional crop quality and impacts on economic aspects like the need of fertilizers and the accessibility of growth areas.

upon iron limitation, plants induce a coordinated set of responses that allow maximizing iron mobilization and uptake from the soil. moreover, internal iron stores are utilized to allocate iron where crucial cellular processes are proceeding. the majority of plants except the grasses use the strategy i response to solubilize and absorb iron into roots when iron is limiting  <cit> . as result, fe is converted into fe and subsequently transported over the plasma membrane into root cells  <cit> . maize and the other grasses have adopted another strategy to assimilate iron that relies on the secretion of iron chelators, non-proteinogenic amino acid derivatives, into the rhizosphere that form stable fe chelates  <cit> . these fe/chelator complexes, are then subsequently imported by a specific transporter  that is located at the root surface  <cit> . however, the further allocation of iron, its pool sizes and the fluxes within and between cells, tissues or whole organs as well as the regulating mechanisms, which orchestrate iron homeostasis, still remain elusive.

hitherto, the knowledge on maize iron homeostasis and the involved genes is mainly derived from mutant studies or the molecular genetic analysis of monogenic differences in graminaceous species, such as rice  <cit> . despite, the considerable number of identified genes and pathways in maize, their contribution to the natural phenotypic variation as well as their impact on modulating environmental adaptation is unknown. the investigation of iron deficiency chlorosis in maize using deep rna sequencing  would allow considering the complexity of genotype and treatment related transcriptional differences  <cit> . in this respect, identified transcriptional differences might either represent causal genes for natural variation of iron mobilization and allocation and the associated chlorosis response in maize or be regulated by the latter. linkage of the gained information with quantitative trait loci  studies for iron efficiency related traits in the ibm population  allows to pin-point differentially regulated genes that co-localize with qtl confidence intervals and thereby represent excellent candidate genes underlying this trait.

the present study investigates the transcriptomes of the maize inbreds b <dig> and mo <dig>  which differ significantly in their chlorosis response upon low iron concentration , in order to identify genotype and/or treatment related differentially expressed transcripts. the differences in regulation of these transcripts were further validated by qrt-pcr and the corresponding expression patterns at both, limiting  and sufficient  iron concentration were integrated in a physiological context. furthermore, a pathway analysis allowed us to substantiate the impact of specific pathways and related genes onto iron deficiency associated chlorosis. altogether, the proposed genes present interesting candidates that might contribute to natural variation and could be the basis for further functional analysis and genetic proceedings in diverse natural populations.

RESULTS
impact of iron regime on the phenotype of the maize inbreds b <dig> and mo17
after hydroponic growth at limiting  and sufficient iron  regime, the maize inbreds b <dig> and mo <dig> were evaluated for the relative chlorophyll content of the 5th and the 6th leaf, determined by measuring spad units, as well as length and weight of root and shoot, and the iron content in the shoot. significant differences between genotypes and treatments were observed . in this respect, mo <dig> showed significantly lower spad values for the 5th as well as the 6th leaf in comparison to b <dig>  these differences were not only observable at limiting iron concentration but also at sufficient iron supply. all over, b <dig> showed significantly weaker chlorosis symptoms than mo <dig> . interestingly, absolute root length was higher for mo <dig> than for b <dig> at 300 μm iron. whereas b <dig> showed no severe decrease in response to iron limitation, mo <dig> root length decreased to even lower values than b <dig> . despite higher root length of mo <dig> at 300 μm iron, root weight was drastically lower at both iron regimes when compared to b <dig> . furthermore, b <dig> was characterized by a significantly larger shoot height as mo <dig> at 300 μm iron . limiting iron supply led to about equal shoot length values for both genotypes . shoot weight was significantly different between the two inbreds at both iron regimes, with b <dig> having a higher shoot mass than mo <dig> . finally, the iron content of the shoot was higher for b <dig> at 300 μm iron than for mo <dig> but decreased for both genotypes at similar levels upon limitation .

in conclusion, b <dig> was characterized by a more vigorous growth under sufficient iron conditions and lower leaf chlorosis under limiting iron . in addition, b <dig> samples at 300 μm iron treatment showed highest iron content and biomass trait values, except for root length, which was highest in mo <dig> plants at 300 μm iron . as determined by principal component analysis of trait values, samples of both inbreds at 300 μm iron were followed by samples of b <dig> and finally mo <dig> samples grown at 10 μm iron . when comparing growth at  <dig> versus 300 μm iron, the decrease in trait values was higher for shoot and root traits as well as for iron content of the shoot in b <dig> than for mo <dig>  contrary, the decrease in spad values and correspondingly stronger leaf chlorosis was observed in mo <dig> than b <dig> .

the iron responsive root transcriptome of b <dig> and mo17
root tissue of two biological replicates was collected at two iron concentrations  in order to determine the differences in the transcriptome of b <dig> and mo <dig>  rna-seq, resulted in a median library size of  <dig>  million reads after quality control . differentially expressed genes were called in four specific two-way comparisons. the two genotype relative comparisons consisted of analysing the expression profile of root tissue from mo <dig> versus tissue from b <dig> grown at 300 μm  and at 10 μm iron . for treatment relative comparisons transcriptome signatures of root tissue from mo <dig>  and b <dig>  grown at 10 μm was compared with such resulting from root tissue of the same genotype collected at 300 μm. all log <dig> fold changes  refer to the expression values at condition  <dig> versus condition  <dig> . in this respect, a positive log2fc in comparison  <dig>  reflects a higher expression in mo <dig> grown at 300 μm iron than in b <dig>  differential expression analysis using four different approaches, namely the cufflinks pipeline with or without rabt  <cit>  assembly as well as the count table based methods provided by the r packages deseq <cit>  and edger <cit>  yielded a similar number of differentially expressed transcripts . analysis by deseq was most stringent as reflected by the lowest number of transcripts with significant expression differences in two-way comparisons. interestingly, every detection method resulted in unique transcripts . moreover, transcripts significant at an fdr <  <dig>  in all four statistical approaches could be identified. such transcripts were called for each of the four two-way comparisons and constituted the final set of the significantly regulated transcripts that was further investigated. none of these transcripts was shared by all four two-way comparisons . altogether,  <dig> unique transcripts were identified as being differentially expressed  in all comparisons, with the highest number of such transcripts in the comparison between mo <dig> and b <dig> at 300 μm . among  <dig> significantly regulated genes within this comparison,  <dig> showed a higher expression in mo <dig> and a median fold change higher than  <dig>  whilst  <dig> showed higher expression at the same fold change in b <dig> . the transcriptomic comparison of these two genotypes at 10 μm iron supply yielded  <dig> significant transcripts, with  <dig> being more abundant in mo <dig> and  <dig> with higher expression values for b <dig> . interestingly, only  <dig> transcripts were detected as differentially expressed at an fdr <  <dig>  for the expression profiles of mo <dig> grown at 10 μm vs. 300 μm iron . the iron deficiency chlorosis resistant genotype b <dig> induced  <dig> out of  <dig> significant genes under iron-limiting conditions. out of the  <dig> iron responsive b <dig> genes, seven showed a differentially expression at non-limiting iron concentration between both genotypes . none of  <dig> genes was significantly responding to iron starvation in mo <dig> . principal component analysis of transcripts and their expression pattern amongst the four two-way comparisons  resulted in a clear sample clustering, separating genotype  and treatment . however, clear differentiation of iron treatments was more pronounced for b <dig> as for mo <dig> samples .

significantly regulated transcripts co-localize with relevant trait qtls
when projecting the final set of significantly regulated on the genetic map, an even distribution across all chromosomes and over their whole length could be observed . besides, several known candidate genes for iron deficiency repsonse in maize, several of the differentially regulated transcripts located adjacent or within qtl confidence intervals for iron homeostasis in the ibm population . most of the regulated transcripts were present either in the comparisons of both genotypes in the 300 μm iron regime or when comparing b <dig> grown at 10 μm to 300 μm iron . the regulated transcripts that mapped to qtls on maize chromosomes at 300 μm iron, tagged such detected for spad values of the 5th and the 6th leaf as well as shoot weight . only a single gene co-localizes with a qtl for shoot length on chromosome i . in the case of 10 μm iron regime, the significantly regulated transcripts again co-localized with qtls for spad values of the 5th and 6th leaf, and shoot weight . in addition also qtls for shoot length as well as root weight were tagged. two transcripts that showed a differential expression between b <dig> roots harvested at  <dig> and 10 μm iron mapped to qtl intervals for sp <dig> at 300 μm iron and sdw at 10 μm, respectively .

go-term enrichment and pathway analysis
a go-term enrichment analysis of the  <dig> significantly regulated genes within all two-way comparisons yielded several cellular, biological and functional enriched gos . in this respect, over-represented cellular component gos were related to chloroplast, the vacuole and membranous components . concerning the gos related to biological processes, these can be roughly grouped to developmental processes, regulation of cell size, and responses to biotic and abiotic stimulus as well as, nitrogen, sulphur, carboxylic acid and amino acid synthetic related processes . especially, methionine and aspartate biosynthetic as well as catabolic process related gos were overrepresented within the significant gene set. in addition, gos of response to metal ions, ion homeostasis, anion transport and inorganic anion transport were also found to be enriched. within the gos associated with molecular function, oxidoreductase, inorganic anion transport, and phosphatase activity were significantly enriched .

a pathway analysis showed that significantly regulated genes within the comparison of both genotypes at 300 μm iron supply were involved in amino acid and polyamine metabolism . contrary to amino-acid metabolism related transcripts that were induced in mo <dig> vs. b <dig> at non limiting iron supply, expression of polyamine metabolic genes was down-regulated in mo <dig> . interestingly, transcripts involved in polyamine metabolism were found to be induced in b <dig> upon iron starvation. in addition, differences were also observed for transport related processes but without a clear trend in respect to genotypic or treatment related comparisons . intriguingly, transcripts involved in metal handling processes that were up-regulated in b <dig> in response to low iron concentration were already present at high expression levels in mo <dig> at 300 μm iron . interestingly, a custom pathway analysis of phytosiderophore and strategy ii iron transport related genes showed differences concerning the expression profile of the significantly regulated gene set for two-way comparisons . correspondingly, expression of these genes was considerably different at non-limiting iron concentration between mo <dig> and b <dig> . in contrast to b <dig>  showing an induction of genes involved in methionine salvage pathway  and phytosiderophore synthesis upon iron limitation, mo <dig> already expressed these genes at high levels in the 300 μm iron regime .

the polymorphic landscape of mo <dig> and b <dig> and its transcriptional equivalent
in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , a high degree of polymorphisms between mo <dig> and b <dig> was observed for the majority of chromosomes . in addition, conserved genomic regions between both inbreds with low structural variation were identified  as already described elsewhere  <cit> . in this respect, an extended region over five arbitrary bins on chromosome viii  was observed . remarkably, several strong transcriptional differences were observed in all four two-way comparisons for genes mapping to this region. a high number of polymorphisms could also be detected within the deduced qtl regions for spad values of the 5th and the 6th leaf as well as the fe content in the shoot at both iron concentrations . in addition, these regions harboured a large number of transcripts, characterized by high median fold changes within the two-way comparisons. the majority of these transcripts were expressed at higher levels in b <dig> at  <dig> and 10 μm iron . furthermore, these transcripts were induced in b <dig> at 10 μm and down-regulated in mo <dig>  the median log2fc of the mapped transcripts declined in the vicinity of the centromere but showed no distinct spatial pattern .

the validation of differences within the transcriptome of the two maize inbreds b <dig> and mo <dig> by qrt-pcr showed a significant correlation  for a selection of  <dig> genes . when focusing on specific candidate genes, divergent expression patterns were observed . the selection of candidate genes comprised genes significantly regulated in the comparison of b <dig> grown at  <dig> and 10 μm iron, except nicotianamine synthase  <dig>  and formate dehydrogenase , which were represented by multiple isoform . however, it is noteworthy that nas <dig> <cit>  was found to be represented by two loci , which were significantly regulated in comp.  <dig>  a further analysis manifested five homologous nas <dig> loci in maize that could represent different isoforms arising from duplication events .

log2fc for the corresponding comparison in which the gene was identified as being differentially expressed  positive log2fcs reflect higher expression values in condition <dig> whilst negative log2fc refer to higher expression in condition  <dig> of specific comparisons .

moreover, the expression level of two putative factors, which showed significant expression differences in comp.  <dig> and with high homology to atpye/osiro <dig> and osiro <dig> respectively  <cit> , displayed an induction within b <dig> upon low iron conditions. interestingly, these genes showed elevated transcript levels in mo <dig> independent of the iron regime. surprisingly, the iro <dig> homologuous gene was characterized by a high rna-seq read coverage over a length of nearly 20 kb downstream of the putative transcription start site . this coverage was significantly lower in mo <dig> even though the read counts within the gene model of the reference sequence were comparable to those observed in b <dig> upon induction. moreover, several genes encoding putative transporters were significantly regulated in comp.  <dig> and  <dig>  it is noteworthy that a putative oligopeptide transporter  was up-regulated in b <dig> upon limiting iron in contrast to putative nitrate transporters, which displayed a down-regulation of their expression at 10 μm iron in b <dig> . in addition, significant genes within the comparison of mo <dig> grown at  <dig> and 10 μm as well as genes at the comparisons of both genotypes at  <dig> and 10 μm iron showing an experiment wide median p-value within the fourth quartile were included in a further analysis and validation by qrt-pcr. in this respect, a putative nip- <dig> homologous aquaporin was amongst the significant genes in comparison  <dig> and showed a down-regulation upon limiting iron supply in the rna-seq analysis. however, the expression pattern could not be validated for this nip- <dig> homologue . transcripts encoding putative cytochrome p <dig>  known to be involved in secondary metabolism, were up-regulated in mo <dig> at  <dig> and 10 μm iron in comparison to b <dig> . remarkably, a putative obtusifoliol 14-alpha demethylase like gene showed a strong and significant down-regulation in b <dig> upon limiting iron . as stated above, genes involved in methionine salvage pathway and phytosiderophore synthesis  were up-regulated in b <dig> upon low iron regime and already displayed high transcript levels in mo <dig> under 300 μm iron . in addition, methylribose-1-phosphate isomerase displays higher expression levels in mo <dig> throughout both iron regimes than b <dig>  which again only induces this gene upon iron starvation.

another interesting finding consists in a transcript encoding a putative burp-domain protein  <cit> , which is down-regulated in its expression within b <dig> at the 10 μm iron regime. this transcript is characterized by a very low expression in mo <dig> independent of the applied iron conditions and displays exon-skipping when compared to b <dig> . finally, transcripts encoding uncharacterized proteins, o-methyl- and glycosyl-transferases, a dormancy related and auxin responsive gene, a clpc <dig> homologue, an enolase, and an aspartic peptidase were validated by qrt . pseudogenes, transposable elements and transcripts giving rise to very small peptides  were omitted from a closer analysis.

discussion
phenotypic responses upon iron regime
as outlined above, the maize inbreds b <dig> and mo <dig> showed a contrasting chlorosis response upon limiting iron regime . our observations might reflect that mo <dig> cannot deal as efficiently as b <dig> with available iron, even far above limiting concentrations. in addition, the evaluation of the morphological values of shoot and root showed a stronger morphological impact of decreasing iron concentration for mo <dig> than for b <dig> . these might also be due to an altered iron homeostasis of mo <dig>  which even at 300 μm tries to maximise iron uptake by increasing root length as well as branching . despite an increase of mo <dig> root length, root weight stays significantly lower at both iron treatments, when compared to b <dig>  correspondingly, the genetic basis of root differences between b <dig> and mo <dig> might influence iron homeostasis and a potential cross-talk between the underlying pathways might exist as shown for arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . if higher biomass of b <dig> is also a result of a more efficient iron and in general nutrient homeostasis cannot be clearly answered. interestingly, the iron content in the shoot of both genotypes was not different at limiting iron but lower in mo <dig> than in b <dig> at 300 μm available iron . this in consequence, might indicate that either mo <dig> displays a significantly altered iron allocation, a deregulation of iron deficiency signal pathways or impairment in iron store build-up. although, b <dig> is characterized by a more vigorous growth under 300 μm treatment, iron content of the shoot was not drastically increased under these conditions. nevertheless, iron deficiency asscoiated chlorosis is significantly lower for b <dig> than for mo <dig>  which might indicate, in addition to other morphological differences, a more efficient iron homeostasis of b <dig>  the nature of the iron deficiency signals, the linked molecular responses, as well as their variation between different genotypes still remain unresolved and should be addressed by further experiments. in this respect, physiological investigations of siderophore production, pool sizes and fluxes as well as of corresponding siderophore/fe-chelate ratios of a diverse germplasm set might provide answers to these issues.

a transcriptomic compendium of b <dig> and mo <dig> at two different iron regimes
apart from transcriptional differences a high number of polymorphisms could be detected between both inbreds, which is in concordance to previous studies  <cit> . correspondingly, a striking drop in polymorphisms on the long arm of chromosome viii was observed as previously described  <cit>  . in contrast to this study  <cit> , a considerable number of differentially regulated transcripts has been detected . the very low level of differential gene expression between b <dig> and mo <dig> in the region on chromosome viii described by springer et al.,  results from comparative analysis by affimetrix 17 k microarray data of seedling, embryo and endosperm tissue  <cit>  without any variation in iron regime. in this respect, the observed strong regulation differences  in the present study are likely due to the action of trans-acting factors, being polymorphic between b <dig> and mo <dig>  moreover, this emphasizes a putative involvement of regulated transcripts in processes linked to efficient iron homeostasis or stress response in general. the relative low number of polymorphisms between both inbred are likely due to the fact that b <dig> and mo <dig> are identical by descent for this region  <cit> . however, as recent studies could show that a maize diversity set displays sequence variation in the corresponding chromosome section  <cit> , a selective fixation during the breeding process  <cit>  or a general lack of structural variation in this region seems to be unlikely. further investigations of this polymorphic  <cit>  and transcriptional landscape, using a maize diversity set grown at different iron regimes, might provide extended information about genes underlying iron efficiency not only of the ibm population but of maize in general.

concerning transcriptional differences in the iron responsive signatures of both inbreds, altogether  <dig> significantly regulated genes over all two-way comparisons could be identified . these differences were validated by qrt-pcr for several known  <cit>  as well as novel candidate genes . overall, a highly significant correlation  was observed , which confirms the quality of the presented transcriptional profiling.

differentially regulated genes resulted from a combination of the most widely used analytical approaches for the analysis of rna-seq data, notably rpkm/fpkm based cufflinks, as well as raw count data based edger and deseq proceedings. these methods can be divided into two concepts referring to library size  or distribution adjustment of read counts   <cit> . both edger and deseq rely on the hypothesis that most of the genes are not differentially expressed and propose a scaling factor for data normalization  <cit> . in contrast cufflinks uses library size and gene length normalization  <cit> . beside these differences in normalization, determination of differentially expressed genes also relies on slightly different statistical tests. this in consequence results de genes that are specific for single analysis approaches . nevertheless, most significant genes are conserved among the different approaches. deseq appears to be most stringent in the determination of de genes, which might be due to the fact that several transcripts are characterized by low expression and elevated biological variation between biological replicates. these in consequence will be discarded by the deseq algorithm. in contrast, edger seems to be liberal for lowly expressed genes but compensates for this by being more conservative with strongly expressed genes  <cit> . recently, cufflinks and the rpkm normalization, which are still widely used, were described to be ineffective in the context of differential transcriptome analysis and should be abandoned  <cit> . in contrast, deseq and edger normalization methods and data analysis were described to be more robust in the presence of different library sizes and widely different library compositions, both of which are typical of real rna-seq data  <cit> . finally, combination of these different, approaches, as presented in this study, offers the possibility to access significant de genes in single approaches as well as conserved de genes among all used approaches. in consequence, we propose the use of an experiment wide fdr significance threshold  to unify the results of such a multi statistical transcriptome survey as a robust gene selection criterion. in this respect, the two genotype specific comparisons yielded the highest number of differentially expressed genes . although, the overlap between treatment and genotype comparisons was low seven out of  <dig> significantly regulated genes within comparison  <dig> were also identified as such in comparison  <dig> . the low number of significantly regulated genes within mo <dig> in the experiment wide and the single statistical test approaches in response to the applied iron regimes  provides further evidence that mo <dig> is unable to efficiently respond upon low iron availability. furthermore, the overlap detected between the genotype specific comparisons at both iron regimes might indicate that in addition to the treatment responsive genes, other factors for example such, influencing genotype specific root and shoot development and morphology might also contribute to overall stress tolerance and in consequence might also impact the iron deficiency associated chlorosis response. whether the differential expression of the identified transcripts is causal for the observed phenotypic differences, or if it is merely a consequence of factors acting up-stream of these genes and modulating their expression needs further functional investigation. nevertheless, principal component analysis of significant transcripts and their expression patterns allows to clearly separate genotype and treatment samples as well as differentiate a pronounced iron deficiency response for b <dig>  which is not the case for mo <dig> . this result further substantiates that mo <dig> is unable to efficiently respond upon low iron availability.

differentially expressed transcripts co-localize with qtls for iron related traits in the ibm population
a first hint, if the identified genes might not only contribute to phenotypic differences between both inbreds as result of genetic background but also to the natural variation of iron efficiency related traits within the ibm population relies in the projection of the corresponding genes onto the genetic map with corresponding qtls . indeed,  <dig> genes co-localized within qtl confidence intervals, detected by benke et al. . the majority of these genes arose from the genotype specific comparisons . however, it is noteworthy that two genes from the comparison of b <dig> grown at the  <dig> vs. 300 μm iron regime also mapped to qtl confidence intervals . these candidates  encode a putative bifunctional methylribose-1-phosphate dehydratase/enolase phosphatase e <dig>  and a formate dehydrogenase isoform, respectively . as both genes are important for methionine salvage pathway, a prerequisite for an efficient phytosiderophore synthesis  <cit> , they represent excellent candidates underlying natural variation of iron efficiency within the ibm population .

analysis of iron deficiency associated chlorosis by an integrative approach using transcriptome, functional and pathway information
this hypothesis is further strengthened by a go-term enrichment and a pathway analysis that highlights the importance methionine, related processes  in concordance to comparable studies in other plants  <cit> . correspondingly, mo <dig> displayed higher stress levels even at high iron regime as consequence of an inefficient iron homeostasis . as amino-acid and carboxylic acid metabolism yield necessary backbones for phytosiderophore synthesis  <cit> , an up-regulation as observed for mo <dig> at both iron regimes fortifies the hypothesis of inefficient iron deficiency response for mo <dig>  independent of physiological iron supply. even the compensation response of mo <dig>  increasing amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide as well as methionine salvage pathways,  <cit>  together with a reduced polyamine synthesis in order to achieve a higher metabolite flux towards phytosiderophore production, as deduced from the transcriptional profile, fails to complement the inefficient iron response . in contrast, b <dig> induces nucleotide and methionine salvage pathways only upon limiting iron supply, and does not require modulating polyamine synthesis . further evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the up-regulation of metal handling pathways and corresponding transcripts independent of iron concentration in mo <dig> .

novel candidates and old cues with new twists contribute to the iron responsive transcriptome of b <dig> and mo17
a closer analysis of phytosiderophore and strategy ii related pathways substantiates the picture of a severely flawed pathway in mo <dig> when compared to b <dig>  whilst the majority of yang cycle genes  <cit>  as well as those being involved in phytosiderophore synthesis  <cit>  are already up-regulated at 300 μm iron in mo <dig>  all of these are only induced by b <dig> to similar transcript levels than mo <dig> upon limiting iron . a particularly striking fact is that mo <dig> shows constitutively high expression levels for these genes at both iron regimes . intriguingly, nas <dig>  which was previously thought to be one of three nas isoforms in maize  <cit> , was identified as being differentially expressed in the comparison of b <dig> grown at  <dig> versus 300 μm iron and represented by two different gene identifiers . a closer look at the corresponding chromosome region and a blast search manifested that two distinct regions harbored all together five nas <dig> genes . the two detected differentially regulated isoforms map to chromosome  <dig> and are separated by another nas <dig> homologue that also shows differences in read coverage between b <dig> and mo <dig>  moreover, the high sequence homology between these isoforms prohibits the correct affiliation of rna-seq reads and therefore the detection of truly differentially expressed isoforms. nevertheless, the deduced read coverage in our study suggests a preferential expression of the isoforms grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig> in b <dig> . the drop in read coverage within the nas <dig> isoform grmzm2g <dig> in b <dig> in contrast to mo <dig> points to an expression that is specific for mo <dig> . however, as the high homology of the corresponding genetic loci hampers the validation of these results by qrt-pcr, other approaches like pyro-sequencing based assays have to be applied in order to fully understand the specific spatio-temporal regulation pattern. in addition to nas <dig>  also naat and a dep <dig> homologous transcript showed transcriptional differences within both inbreds upon iron deficiency . in contrast to mo <dig>  which displayed elevated expression levels independent of iron conditions for the corresponding genes, b <dig> induced the latter only upon iron deficiency to equal levels than mo <dig> . correspondingly, we suggest that a transcription factor regulating expression of these and other downstream genes, is either impaired in its regulatory function or its own expression upon the iron deficiency signal.

interestingly, two bhlh transcription factors, which were significantly induced in b <dig> upon limited iron showed elevated transcript levels at mo <dig> across both iron regimes . these regulators show high homology to iro <dig> from rice  <cit>  as well as pye from arabidopsis and iro <dig> from rice, respectively  <cit> . the gene, grmzm2g <dig> might encode the maize iro <dig> homologue, which is responsible for the induction of iron deficiency related genes, including those involved in nicotianamine synthesis  <cit> . the high levels of iro <dig> in mo <dig> even at 300 μm provide an explanation for the elevated expression of genes related to methionine salvage pathway and nicotianamine synthesis  <cit> . in addition, read coverage within the corresponding gene model exceeded the current one for 20 kb downstream of the putative transcription start . surprisingly, read coverage was high in mo <dig> in a region far away from the putative transcription start site but at the vicinity of another gene  with no mapped reads. interestingly the rice homologue also possesses a bhlh domain . altogether, our data indicate that the gene model for the maize locus grmzm2g <dig> might have to be revised and furthermore that this locus might undergo alternative splicing. in addition, qrt validated higher expression levels for mo <dig> even at 300 μm iron but also suggested a further significant induction at 10 μm iron for mo <dig> . high iro <dig> levels in rice result from the action of the up-stream iron deficiency responsive element-binding factor  <dig>  <cit> . although, a slight difference in idef <dig> could be detected by qrt , the expression pattern within the rna-seq data was not significantly different at an fdr <  <dig> . intriguingly, the second bhlh transcription factor showed as closest homologues the rice iro <dig> gene and pye  of arabidopsis. induction of this gene in b <dig> upon limiting iron and its expression profile, which is comparable to grmzm2g <dig> in mo <dig>  indicates a contribution to efficient iron homeostasis. atpye, is known to be involved in maintaining iron homeostasis under low iron conditions and regulating root hair morphology of the strategy i plant arabidopsis  <cit> . osiro <dig>  which also shows high homology to grmzm2g <dig> has been described as an iron regulated bhlh transcription factor that plays an important role for fe homeostasis in rice by acting as negative regulator of the fe deficiency response  <cit> . the transcription profile of grmzm2g <dig>  as observed in this study is identical to the one of iro3in rice. in this respect, the corresponding maize gene might act analogous to osiro <dig>  if both maize transcription factors act independent of each other or are both controlled by higher ranking factors like idef <dig> needs further investigation. moreover, as bhlh transcription factors often form homo- and/or hetero-dimers  <cit> , a possible interaction of these genes might impact on iron deficiency associated chlorosis of both inbreds. a more essential question that has to be addressed by further experiments is, if solely internal cellular iron levels act as iron deficiency signal and trigger the idef1/iro <dig> <cit>  and iro <dig> like regulation networks or if other mechanisms are involved. an e-qtl study of the identified iron responsive transcription factors  would provide first answers.

in addition, a putative oligopeptide transporter  could also be identified that showed an induction in its expression within the rna-seq experiment for both genotypes upon limiting iron conditions . this regulation pattern could be validated by qrt, although induction upon 10 μm iron regime in replicate b was stronger for mo <dig> than for b <dig> . one might speculate, that this transport protein, which only shows weak homology to the yellow stripe like  transporter clade  <cit>  might be involved in the intracellular transport of phytosiderophores, their precursors or related iron complexes. a putative function in phytosiderophore export to the rhizosphere can be excluded, as the maize homologues  <cit>  of the corresponding gene in rice ostom <dig> <cit>  differ from this putative oligopetide transporter.

an intriguing finding is the strong expression difference of a putative obtusifoliol-14α demethylase , which undergoes a down-regulation in b <dig> upon limiting iron, but displays nearly no expression in mo <dig> . as this gene is involved in sterol biosynthesis, and as it has been previously described that the relative abundance of Δ5-sterols correlates with aluminum tolerance in rice  <cit> , a potential consequence of the extremely low transcript expression in mo <dig> could be an altered sterol composition of root membranes. as low sterol abundance seems to correlate with higher membrane permeability and an accumulation of metal ions  <cit> , higher sterol abundance in b <dig> root tissue might improve its iron efficiency by reducing undesired metal accumulation and toxicity.

in addition, the regulation pattern of the gene grmzm2g <dig> encoding a putative burp-domain could be due to developmental processes impacted by the stress response as described elsewhere  <cit> . moreover, expression of a clpc <dig> homologous chaperone gene could also be validated by qrt-pcr . atclpc <dig>  has been identified as being responsible for the arabidopsis mutant phenotype irm <dig>  showing typical fe-deficiency chlorosis  <cit> . in this respect, clpc <dig> is involved in leaf iron homeostasis, presumably via chloroplast translocation of some nuclear-encoded proteins which function in fe transport. the homologous gene in maize might fulfill similar functions. the high transcript levels of two cytochrome p <dig> genes, involved in polyphenol synthesis, in mo <dig> at both iron regimes points to an iron deficiency compensation response . in this respect, a flawed iron deficiency chlorosis response in mo <dig> might lead at both iron conditions to increased production of phenols that, after being excreted to the rhizosphere, solubilize fe from the soil  <cit> . whether this strategy i related mechanism supports iron assimilation by phytosiderophores  <cit>  remains theoretical. another, explanation would be a general stress response of mo <dig>  which in consequence results in elevated phenol production  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
over  <dig> significantly regulated transcripts at two iron regimes within both inbreds were identified that besides novel candidate genes included known iron responsive loci. the integration of qtl information and transcriptome data emphasize a contribution of the above mentioned genes to natural variation of the investigated traits. further analysis of the proposed candidate genes and pathways in a diverse germplasm set will extend our understanding about the impact of the latter to natural trait variation in maize. the presented data is a valuable resource for researcher investigating iron deficiency response in graminaceous and non-graminaceous plants and represents a vantage point for the generation of molecular markers in order to improve iron deficiency chlorosis resistance in maize.
