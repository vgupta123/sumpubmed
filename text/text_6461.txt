BACKGROUND
chlorophylls form the most abundant and the most important class of plant pigments, as they play central role in photosynthesis process which is a main source of energy for plants as well as a main source of oxygen in atmosphere of the earth. in eukaryotic plant and algae cells chlorophyll is located in chloroplasts. chloroplast is an organoid which, like the mitochondria, contains its own genome sometimes called ‘plastome’  <cit> . however, chloroplasts are strongly dependent on the nuclear genome of the plant cell. in angiosperms, plastome contains only approximately  <dig> protein-coding genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and some metabolic processes, as well as trna and rrna genes  <cit> , while the amount nuclear-encoded proteins which are predicted to be targeted to chloroplasts is as much as 2500– <dig> . in a. thaliana, from  <dig> to  <dig> cyanobacterial proteins have been identified, of which about a half are targeted to chloroplasts  <cit> . it was suggested that about  <dig> a. thaliana genes descend from cyanobacterial genomes, however, only about  <dig> of them are predicted to have their products targeted to chloroplasts  <cit> .

transcription of chloroplast genome is provided by two types of rna polymerase – a nuclear-encoded plastid rna-polymerase  and plastid encoded plastid rna-polymerase . pep is an rna polymerase of bacterial design, and it uses sigma-factors for transcription initiation, which are nuclear-encoded  <cit> . chloroplast genes can be divided into three groups – class i genes have promoters that are only recognized by pep, class ii have promoters recognized by both enzymes, and class iii are only transcribed by nep  <cit> . most genes in plastome have promoters that can be recognized by both types of polymerase  <cit> .

chloroplast genes control is mostly post-transcriptional. it is regulated by nuclear-encoded proteins, and in some cases a single nuclear-encoded protein is required specifically for controlling of expression of a single chloroplast-encoded gene  <cit> .

all of the above suggests that a sophisticated coordination of plastome and nuclear genome is required for proper development and functioning of chloroplasts. such coordination is formed by anterograde signaling – from nucleus to chloroplast – and retrograde signaling – from chloroplast to nucleus  <cit> . intermediates of chlorophyll synthesis pathway, namely protoporphyrin ix, serve as signaling molecules and are transported from chloroplast to nucleus  <cit> . on the other hand, a number of authors disagree with the role of protoporphyrin ix as a signaling molecule  <cit> . this leads to a conclusion that mechanisms of nucleus-to-chloroplast and chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling are poorly understood.

although a number of mutant phenotypes with full or partial chlorophyll deficiency have been described, genes responsible for such phenotype formation are largely unknown. barley  alm gene  determining albino lemma and pericarp has not been sequenced yet, and the target or regulatory genes for alm remain unknown. near-isogenic lines  are the proper models for isolation of genes underlying phenotypic variation by transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics approaches . availability of barley genome reference sequence  <cit>  facilitates application of wgs-based approaches  for investigating genetic networks responsible for phenotypic variation. rna-seq approach has been already employed successfully to uncover the history of wild barley domestication and distribution  <cit> , for studying the gene family of barley aquaporines  <cit>  or creating snp maps of barley  <cit> .

in the current study, rna-seq was exploited for identification of genes involved in tissue-specific albinism using near-isogenic lines differing by the alm gene allelic state.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of the near-isogenic lines and pleotropic effect of alm
the i:bwalm near-isogenic line is characterized by albino lemma , however the upper part of the lemma and awns are green. bowman lemma and awn have a green color . chlorophyll fluorescence is observed in the central part of the lemma in bowman, while it is absent in the central part of i:bwalm lemma. chlorophyll fluorescence is also observed in lemma-awn transition point of bowman . in i:bwalm,the analysis of the fluorescence pattern in transition point between the white and green zones  detected an alternation of cells containing a population of fluorescing chloroplasts and lacking them . while moving in the basal direction the number of detected fluorescent cells decreases to extinction . the appearance and fluorescent pattern in awns  did not reveal differences between bowman and i:bwalm.fig.  <dig> the spike phenotype of bowman  and i:bwalm. a, b, e, f appearance at visible light. c, d, g chlorophyll fluorescence patterns of selected areas




pleutropic effect of alm was observed on auricles , stem node  and sheath of the first leaf of the i:bwalm line. in bowman, all these parts of plant are green. along the surface of stem both lines have the green strands with bright chlorophyll fluorescence , however in the i:bwalm node adjacent region these strands flat out, and a fragmentation of fluorescent strands into the loosely spaced islands is detected . the shape of patterns of cell population containing fluorescing chloroplasts in this zone differs between bowman and i:bwalm. in the bowman plants cells arranged in files . in i:bwalm cells with fluorescence form irregular patterns, no cell files are observed .fig.  <dig> the stem node phenotype of bowman  and i:bwalm . a, d appearance at visible light. b, c, e, f chlorophyll fluorescence pattern of selected areas at low and high magnifications




thus, the alm gene results in vanishing of a chloroplasts population with chlorophyll in lemma, pericarp, auricles with adjacent leaf blade region, stem node with adjacent stem region and sheath of the first leaf. the alternation of the patterns of cells containing a population of fluorescing chloroplasts and cells without fluorescence signal is evident in transition region between the white and green zones . difference between i:bwalm and bowman in the cell arrangement  demonstrates that alm gene, in addition to effects on chloroplasts, results in modification of patterning of cells with active chloroplasts in pericarp and auricles.

qpcr gene differential expression validation
the qrt-pcr-based evaluation of transcription of two genes in the spikelets of the nils is summarized in fig.  <dig>  the first is gene mloc_ <dig> that encodes type iii light-harvesting complex ii chlorophyll a/b-binding precursor protein. its expression level estimated from rna-seq data decreased in i:bwalm plants more than 45-fold . the second is a xloc_ <dig> transcript that, according to gene ontology analysis, is functionally connected to vesicle transport. its expression level estimated from rna-seq data increased in i:bwalm plants more than 1000-fold . according to rt-pcr data type iii lhcii cab precursor protein gene transcript was abundant in bowman and significantly decreased  in albino plants . xloc_ <dig> transcript was poorly detectable in bowman, however its expression level increased significantly  in spikelets of i:bwalm plants . the difference between expression levels estimated by rt-pcr for these two genes is p =  <dig>  for mloc_ <dig> gene and p =  <dig>  for xloc_ <dig> gene according to t-test.fig.  <dig> changes in transcription level of genes mloc_ <dig>  and xloc_ <dig>  as obtained with qpcr experiment




libraries quality assessment
 <dig> short reads in six pooled libraries were produced as raw sequenced data. each library was examined for quality control, adapter sequences were trimmed and reads with insufficient length or too low mean quality were removed, which resulted in discarding of  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % of reads in five of six libraries, and removal of 40 % sequences in library bowman  .table  <dig> read statistics for i:bwalm and bowman libraries




next, we performed analysis of the mapping reads from the six libraries to estimate the optimal value of the mismatch parameter. mapping reads to the reference genome of h. vulgare was performed with tophat <dig> tool ten times, with increasing number of allowed mismatches from  <dig> to  <dig> as described in the methods section. the resulting fpkm counts for each transcribed genome fragment are listed in additional file  <dig>  we observed an increase in percentage of fragments mapped to genome in each library with increasing mismatch number . in five of six libraries proportion of mapped reads ranged from 23 % to 38 %  to 64 % to 79 % ; for the bowman  library percentage changes from 21 % to 39 % for alignment with  <dig> and  <dig> mismatches, respectively .fig.  <dig> dependence of the number of mapped reads with respect to mismatch parameter for tophat <dig> alignment of short read libraries. the x-axis indicates the number of allowed mismatches for the mapping; the y-axis shows the percent of mapped reads for each library




additionally we monitored changes of four characteristics of genome coverage quality for six libraries  with respect to mismatch number. the ratio of these values to their maxima in ten tophat <dig> alignments is shown in fig.  <dig>  this plot  demonstrated that number of mapped reads increases with increase in number of allowed mismatches. however, at mismatch values greater than 12 the number of matched reads saturates its maximal value. similarly, nuncov drops with increase in number of allowed mismatches, and norphans is reduced in alignments with six or more allowed mismatches compared to alignments with two and four allowed mismatches. combination of these three parameters is believed to be optimal for alignment with  <dig> allowed mismatches.fig.  <dig> dependence of the number of mapped reads to the different types of expressed genome fragments on allowed mismatches. see methods for more information




aligning reads to the reference genome with star program resulted in successfully mapping of  <dig> to 83 % of reads for five libraries out of six, with bowman  library having only 46 % of mapped reads .table  <dig> metrics of libraries mapping to h. vulgare reference genome using star tool




after examination of considered parameters, the mapping with  <dig> allowed mismatches was taken into further analysis. a total of  <dig>  million of reads were mapped to the reference genome from all six libraries. cufflinks pipeline identified  <dig> genome fragments that are covered by short reads from at least one library and/or are annotated in the current genome assembly.

next, we compared the coverage of the h. vulgare transcripts by reads from each of the libraries. we generated tables of counts indicating the transcript coverage for  <dig> genomic regions from h. vulgare genome annotation by cuffnorm tool,  <dig> of which passed out filtering criteria. results of clustering of six libraries with respect to the similarity of coverage of these regions are shown in fig.  <dig>  the tree diagram demonstrates that estimates of coverage for h. vulgare genes form two large clusters corresponding to two contrast genotypes irrespectively to the alignment methods and sample replicate. detailed analysis of the diagram demonstrates that the read counts estimates performed by tophat2and star tools for the same replicate are closer than those for different replicates are.fig.  <dig> libraries clustering. six mappings performed with tophat <dig> and six mappings performed using star were clusterized. clustering was performed with upgma method basing on the count numbers of each transcribed genome fragment

table shows numbers in thousands of library fragments mapped to the respective genes in i:bwalm and bowman




differential expression identification
we used two tools to identify differentially expressed genes between i:bwalm and bowman lines. using cufflinks pipeline we detected  <dig> genome fragments with differential expression , of which  <dig> had a higher level of expression in i:bwalm plants, and  <dig> had a higher level of expression in bowman line plants. implementing edger package for r, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> fragments with higher and lower expression levels in i:bwalm plants, respectively .  <dig> fragments with increased expression and  <dig> fragments with decreased expression in line i:bwalm were detected with both tools.fig.  <dig> consistency between edger and cufflinks identification of differentially expressed genes. consistency of list of genes with lower level of expression in line i:bwalm is shown on the diagram a. the diagram b shows consistency of lists of genes with higher level of expression in line i:bwalm. genes detected with edger are shown in green, genes detected with cufflinks are shown in red





thus,  <dig> genome fragments are revealed to have differential expression , which comprises approximately  <dig>  % of all transcribed fragments. among those there are  <dig> genome fragments with lower level of expression in i:bwalm.  <dig> of those fragments are genes annotated in barley genome current assembly,  <dig> have a known protein product.  <dig> genome fragments have differential expression with higher level of expression in i:bwalm.  <dig> of those fragments are genes annotated in h. vulgare genome assembly.  <dig> of those genes have known protein products – gene mloc_ <dig> that encodes 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase, gene mloc_ <dig> that encodes asparagine synthetase, gene mloc_ <dig> encoding leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinase family protein, and gene mloc_ <dig> encoding non-specific lipid transfer protein. figure  <dig> shows discrepancy between a set of genes with higher and lower levels of expression in line i:bwalm.
fig.  <dig> distribution of coverage level changes among plastid operons. operons were categorized into four groups according to their expression levels in two barley lines. the group named log >  <dig> corresponds to genes that have zero expression in i:bwalm line and non-zero expression in line bowman




furthermore, cufflinks pipeline identified  <dig> genome fragments as having differential isoform expression  with p-value corrected through benjamini-hochberg procedure less than  <dig> . of these fragments,  <dig> are genes annotated in current assembly of barley genome.  <dig> of these genes have known functions. list of genes with differentially expressed isoforms includes gene mloc_ <dig> encoding tetratricopeptide-like superfamily protein, gene mloc_ <dig> encoding thylakoid rhodanese-like protein, gene mloc_ <dig> encoding non-specific lipid transfer protein and genes mloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig> that encode chlorophyll a-b binding proteins. this list also includes  <dig> fragments localized on plastid genome. genome fragments with differential isoform expression are listed in supplementary table  <dig> 

chloroplast gene expression analysis
dissimilarity between coverage of chloroplast genome fragments was observed in results of cufflinks library reads mappings. according to the results obtained,  <dig> genome fragments have zero level of expression in both lines. among those fragments are  <dig> genes of trna, genes that encode two ribosomal proteins, photosystem ii protein z, two rna-polymerase subunits, four cytochrome proteins, nadh-plastoquinon oxidoreductase subunit  <dig> and gene ycf <dig> that encodes hypothetical chloroplast protein.  <dig> genome fragments that are expressed in bowman line have zero level of expression in i:bwalm line. among these fragments are genes that encode three photosystem i proteins, two photosystem ii proteins, atp synthase cf <dig> subunit iv, four nadh-plastoquinon oxidoreductase subunits, chloroplast envelope membrane protein, photosystem i assembly protein ycf <dig>  gene of 5s ribosomal rna and three genes of trna. additional file  <dig> lists expressed chloroplast genome fragments, respective fpkm values for i:bwalm libraries and bowman libraries and log <dig> values of expression fold change.

all chloroplast genome fragments that have nonzero coverage in i:bwalm have higher coverage levels in bowman line. figure  <dig> illustrates a number of operons with one of four levels of expression change: ‘zero transcription’ for operons with no transcription observed in both studied lines, ‘log < 2’ for operons with less than four-folds change of transcription level, ‘log > 2’ for operons with change in transcription level from four-folds to 368-fold, and ‘log > 10’ for operons with zero transcription in line i:bwalm and sufficiently high level of transcription in line bowman.fig.  <dig> changes of expression levels of selected gene sets between two barley lines. genes that encode some of the photosystems i and ii proteins and genes that have a functional association with vesicle transport according to the results of go enrichment analysis were taken as an example. genes encoding photosystem proteins have a lower level of expression in i:bwalm line. genes associated with vesicle transport have a higher level of expression in i:bwalm line




a plastid genome fragment that contains  <dig> genes has the highest among all plastid fragments level of coverage in i:bwalm line. of those  <dig> genes,  <dig> are genes of ribosomal proteins. four other genes encode photosystem ii protein n, translational initiation factor  <dig>  rna-polymerase alpha-subunit and nadh-plastoquinon oxidoreductase subunit  <dig>  list of other fragments that have high coverage in i:bwalm line includes four ribosomal rna coding genes, three photosystem ii protein genes, rubisco large chain gene, atp synthase cf <dig> subunits i and iii genes, atp synthase cf <dig> alpha subunit gene and ribosomal protein s <dig> gene.

gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes
we analyzed the distribution of the putative protein products go-terms annotation in three categories: biological function, molecular functions and cellular compartment localization. the most significantly presented gene ontology terms related to molecular function, biological processes and cellular compartment localizations attributed to putative protein products of genes with higher level of expression in bowman are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> most represented go terms associated with differentially expressed genes




for genes with higher expression level in i:bwalm only go terms associated with cell localization were identified. nineteen out of  <dig> genes were associated with following terms: ‘vesicle’, ‘membrane-bound vesicle’, ‘cytoplasmic vesicle’, ‘cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicle’ at corrected p =  <dig>  for each of the terms.

additional files  <dig> and  <dig> show go terms associated with biological processes and cellular components for genes with lower level of expression in i:bwalm line, respectively. additional file  <dig> illustrates go terms associated with cellular components for genes with higher expression level in line i:bwalm.

pathway analysis for differentially expressed genes
six hundred and ninety-four genes with changes of expression level were analyzed in respect to their involvement in metabolic pathways. ‘omics data mapping’ tool of plantcyc database recognized  <dig> of these genes. seventeen metabolic pathways included at least two genes with significant expression level change. five pathways with highest numbers of genes with different expression levels are listed in table  <dig>  other pathways are: sucrose biosynthesis i , triacylglycerol degradation, nad/nadh phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, homogalacturonan degradation, aerobic respiration iii , gluconeogenesis i, glycolysis i , cdp-diacylglycerol biosynthesis i, triacylglycerol biosynthesis, phosphate acquisition, chlorophyllide a biosynthesis i .table  <dig> barley metabolic pathways that involve genes with differential expression between bowman and i:bwalm lines

values of logarithm of fold change and p-values  are provided for each gene




the ‘calvin-benson-bassham circle’ pathway that includes a highest number of differentially expressed genes is shown in the fig.  <dig>  it is related to ‘sucrose biosynthesis i ’ pathway that has four genes with different levels of expression. for gene mloc_ <dig>  which encodes an uncharacterized protein, differential expression was not confirmed. the other three genes included in a pathway are mloc_ <dig>  mloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig>  which are also included in calvin-benson-bassham cycle, and have a confirmed differential expression.fig.  <dig> participation of differentially expressed genes in calvin-benson-bassham cycle pathway. the scheme of pathway is taken from pmn database. genes with higher level of expression in bowman line are marked in red





the step of calvin-benson-bassham cycle that has the highest number of differentially expressed genes included in it is a rate-limiting  <cit>  co <dig> fixation, which occurs in form of d-ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylation. this step involves ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase enzyme. it consists of large and small subunits, each of which is present in eight copies in a functioning polypeptide. the large subunit contains active site of the enzyme and is chloroplast-encoded. in plants, a family of nuclear genes rbcs encodes different forms of small chain subunit that may be involved in regulation of enzyme catalytic activity  <cit> . it was also shown that translation level of large subunit is suppressed in absence of small subunit proteins  <cit> .

in the current study, expression levels of gene mloc_ <dig> that encodes rubisco large chain and is localized on morex_contig_ <dig> fragment of current genome assembly, as well as genes mloc_ <dig>  mloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig> that encode three rubisco small chain subunits, are shown to be lower in i:bwalm in comparison with bowman. differential expression was confirmed by edger tool for genes mloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig> and by both edger and cuffdiff tools for genes mloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig> 

the following step in the pathway includes gene mloc_ <dig>  which encodes phosphoglycerate kinase , an enzyme that catalyzes phosphorilation of 3-phospho-d-glycerate. it exists in all living organisms and has a highly conserved structure. the enzyme functions as a monomer. in plants, pgk is reported to have two isozymes, one cytosolic and one chloroplast, which are encoded by two different nuclear genes and are expressed independently from each other  <cit> .

the next step of calvin-benson-bassham cycle is reduction of the carboxyl of  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate to an aldehyde. it involves enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . in plants, gapdh exist in cytosole as a heterotetramer and in chloroplasts in a different form  <cit> . subunits of this enzyme are encoded by nuclear genes  <cit> . plantcyc database indicates that two genes are included into this step, one of which is mloc_ <dig> gene that shows differential expression between studied lines of barley. protein product of this gene is referred to as ‘predicted protein/uncharacterized protein’ in barley genome assembly version 1v <dig> 

differentially expressed genes mloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig> are included in regeneration of ribulose. this stage includes series of reactions and a variety of enzymes, among which is fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase enzyme, which is also involved in gluconeogenesis and sucrose biosynthesis.

finally, gene mloc_ <dig> that encodes phosphoribulokinase protein is involved in phosphorilation of d-ribulose-5-phosphate. resulting product of the stage is d-ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate that is later used as a substrate by rubisco. however, differential expression for gene mloc_ <dig> was not confirmed by either cuffdiff or edger tools.

furthermore, analysis of several plant pigment biosynthesis pathways demonstrated that they contain a number of differentially expressed genes. pathways ‘superpathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis ’ and ‘superpathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis ’ each have three barley genes annotated in plantcyc database for h. vulgare. none of the genes demonstrated differential expression at the specified significance level. pathway ‘chlorophyll cycle’ contain five genes, three of them have significant changes in expression levels . pathway ‘zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin and violaxanthin interconversion’ has eight annotated genes; three of them have significant changes in expression level and one has differential isoform expression . all differentially expressed genes included in these two pathways have a lower level of expression in i:bwalm line. table  <dig> shows the lists of annotated barley genes included in the abovementioned pathways.fig.  <dig> involvement of differentially expressed genes in chlorophyll cycle pathway. the diagram of pathway was taken from barleycyc online database. genes with differential expression are shown in red on the respective stages of their protein products involvement

de novo transcriptome assembly

de novo assembly of transcriptome was performed to verify transcriptome data for presence of novel transcripts. we merged data from different samples of the same genotype before assembly analysis. statistics of resulted sequence assemblies provided in table  <dig>  alignment of resulted transcripts to h. vulgare reference genome by megablast tool of blast package. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in assemblies of ibwalm and bowman, respectively, showed no significant homology to any sequences of reference genome.table  <dig> bowmanand i:bwalm libraries assembly statistics




transcripts with no significant homology to barley genome were examined in details. they were mapped to escherichia coli genome in order to remove possible contaminants.  <dig> transcripts from i:bwalm assembly and  <dig> transcripts from bowman assembly showed homology with e. coli genome sequence. these transcripts were removed from further analysis. after aligning assembled transcripts without h. vulgare similarity to cds sequences of oryza sativa and brachypodium distachion several homologous sequences were found. alignment to arabidopsis thaliana cds sequences revealed no homology in any of the transcripts.

thus,  <dig> transcripts from i:bwalm assembly and  <dig> transcripts from bowman assembly showed no significant homology to h. vulgare genome . among those,  <dig> transcripts are common to both assemblies .table  <dig> mapping statistics of assembled transcriptomes

discussion
differential expression analysis
 <dig> genome fragments were distinguished as having differential expression, while  <dig> genome fragments have changes in expression level greater than four-folds, based on their rpkm values. in studies of plants comparative transcriptomics numbers of differentially expressed genes are usually presented in thousands:  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, it is stated that no less than 20 % of plant genes express differentially in darkness and light  <cit> . thus, we suppose that a number of genes that we identified as differentially expressed should not be considered exaggerated. at the same time, changes in the transcriptional level do not necessarily correlate with changes in levels of translation  <cit> , and not all the observed changes in transcription level of the genes may be functionally associated with phenotypic changes between two barley lines.

five genes encoding different pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins  show changes in expression level, with four of them having lower level of expression in line i:bwalm and one having a higher level of expression in that line. ppr proteins are rna-binding proteins that are especially abundant in land plants  <cit> . most ppr proteins in plant cells are targeted either to mitochondria or chloroplast, where they bind rna and affect gene expression  <cit> . more than  <dig> ppr genes are identified in a. thaliana genome  <cit> , however, only  <dig> such genes are annotated in barley genome, which suggests that actual number of ppr genes that express differentially between bowman and i:bwalm lines is much larger.

gene ontology analysis revealed that genes with lower level of expression in line i:bwalm are mostly functionally associated with porphyrin pigment biosynthesis. since chlorophylls a and b are chemical derivatives of porphyrin, it islikelythat these genes are indirectly associated with chlorophyll synthesis. genes with higher level of expression in line i:bwalm are functionally associated with cytosol vesicles. despite tic and toc membrane complexes being a primary path of protein transport into plastids  <cit> ,vesicular transport is known to play role in this process  <cit> .

pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes participate in several metabolic pathways, including photosynthesis light reaction and calvin-benson-bassham cycle that occurs in chloroplasts. interconversion of several xanthin derivatives is another biological process that takes place on chloroplast membranes  <cit> . different forms of xanthins are included in light-harvesting complexes of chloroplast and participate in non-photosynthetic quenching process that protects the cell from oxydative stress  <cit> . reduction in expression level of genes included in this pathway is in consistent with the general expression level decrease of genes functionally connected with chloroplasts. likewise, observed lower expression levels of genes included in ‘chlorophyll cycle’ pathway is in agreement with lowered amounts of chlorophyll in studied organs.

variegated mutants that have patches of albino cells in leaves and other organs have been studied in regard of plastid composition of their cells that lack chlorophyll. it was shown that in many variegated mutants chloroplasts lack thylakoids but accumulate vesicles  <cit> .

plastid gene expression patterns in bowman and i:bwalm genotypes
changes in transcript abundance of most plastid genome fragments are observed between two barley lines . we did not observeany plastid genome fragment which abundance in line i:bwalm is increased compared to bowman. the only genes that did not change their abundance in i:bwalm/bowman are those having zero coverage in both barley lines. changes in coverage observed for the majority of transcribed plastid genome fragments  is four-folds to sixteen-folds . majority  of genes in operons with changes in expression levels are protein-coding genes, mostly encoding ribosomal proteins  and photosystems i and ii proteins  . according to the results of microscopic analysis, many cells in studied organs lack chlorophyll. however, observed expression of several plastid genome fragments suggests that these cells still contain plastids, whether these are abnormal chloroplasts that do not contain chlorophyll or some other types of colorless plastids, presumably proplastids or etioplasts. at the same time, these plastids are either less abundant and/or less transcriptionally active than chloroplasts in cells of bowman plants. this suggestion can explain overall decrease of plastid genome fragments coverage in line i:bwalm.fig.  <dig> distribution of functions of genes in differentially expressed plastid operons




while most plastid genome fragments have a decrease in transcript abundance ranging from four-fold to sixteen-fold that can be accounted for by reduction in plastid number and/or general transcriptional activity, several genome fragments have a more abrupt decrease in transcription. three genome fragments have decrease in transcript abundance of approximately  <dig> times in i:bwalm compared to bowman. one of these fragments contains genes psbc and psbd encoding subunits of photosystem ii, the other fragment contains a trna gene, and the third contains gene psac encoding a photosystem i subunit and genes ndhe and ndhd that encode nadh-plastoquinoneoxydoreductase subunits. gene rps <dig> that encodes one of ribosome proteins has an 87-fold transcript reduction. genes that encode  <dig> s, 16s and 23s ribosomal rnas have decrease in transcript abundance from 155-fold to 368-fold.

finally,  <dig> genome fragments that are expressed in bowman have zero coverage in i:bwalm. this list contains several genes encoding photosystems i and ii subunits, nadh-plastoquinoneoxydoreductase subunits, trna genes, 5s rrna gene and a gene encoding atp synthase cf <dig> subunit iv.

it was shown that most plastid genes in h. vulgare belong to type ii, i.e., have promoters for both pep and nep, with only rpob gene being transcribed solely by nep  <cit> . with this in mind, it looks surprising that we did not observe expression of rpob and rpoc2genes in both lines.  <dig> genes encoding plastid trnas are not expressed in eitherlines as well. at the same time, plastidal rrna-encoding genes have high levels of transcript abundance in both lines, except for 5s ribosomal rna gene that shows no expression in i:bwalm line while being transcriptionally active in bowman line.

etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll and is colorless. etioplasts form in leaves deprived of light. a comparison of chloroplast and etioplast proteomes revealed that several proteins present in etioplasts do not occur in chloroplasts  <cit> . namely, protochlorophyllide reductase is believed to be an indispensable component of etioplast proteome. gene pora encoding the enzyme is transcriptionally active both in i:bwalm and bowman. however, its expression is mainly controlled on translation stage  <cit> . nadh dehydrogenase subunits i and j are present in etioplasts as well  <cit> . at the same time, in i:bwalm no transcripts of genes ndhi and ndhj that encode two respective subunits were found, whereas a low level of transcription was observed for both genes in bowman.

it should be noted, however, that changing the level of transcription for some genes maybe not the primary cause of albinism  <cit> . albinism in plants may be due to various reasons, also including spontaneous chromosomal and ptdna rearrangements, predominantly single or multiple deletions of dna segments. most deletions occur in the large single copy region, which is the least stable region in the entire plastome genome. this region primarily contains genes responsible for photosynthesis, genes encoding the proteins of photosystem i and ii. thus, further investigation is needed to clarify possible molecular mechanisms of in i:bwalm mutants in details.

de novo transcriptome assembly
three de novo transcriptome assemblies of three pooling combinations of six libraries were performed –  all six libraries together,  three bowman libraries together and  three i:bwalm libraries together. as a result, assembly of all six pooled libraries was deemed ineffective, since total length of transcripts and n <dig> values in that assembly were inferior in comparison to other two assemblies. therefore, assembly of all six pooled libraries was removed from further analysis.

more than 99 % of assembled transcripts were successfully mapped to current h. vulgare genome assembly. furthermore, n <dig> for both assemblies is slightly higher than reported in other works for h. vulgare transcriptome assembly  <cit> . this suggests that quality of assembly is satisfying. relatively small number of transcripts that show no homology to barley genome and low percentage of short reads that did not map to genome during alignment point out that current version of h. vulgare genome, despite still being in development, is profound enough.

for sequences from de novo assembly that show no homology to genomic sequences of other plant species and have no replicates in the other assembly it can be assumed that they might be assembly errors. on the other hand, it is reported  <cit>  that other plant transcriptomes have a fraction of unique sequences that do not align to other plant genomes. a more thorough investigation of assembled transcripts is required to distinguish assembly errors from unique transcripts. the fact that no novel transcripts aligned to a. thaliana cds suggests that novel transcripts contain sequences specific at least to poaceae, and possibly even narrower group.

CONCLUSIONS
although peculiarities of genetic mechanisms controlling formation of albino lemma and pericarp phenotype remain unclear and require further investigation, several aspects of this process are clarified. despite lack of chlorophyll and properly formed and functioning chloroplasts, albino cells retain transcriptionally-active plastids. while genes with lower level of expression in i:bwalm line are mostly associated with chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis, genes with higher level of expression in i:bwalm line are functionally associated with vesicle formation. vesicles play essential role in transporting proteins to chloroplasts, and at the same time vesicles are accumulated in different types of non-photosynthesizing plastids, namely etioplasts and proplastids. furthermore, it is known that in variegated leaves chlorophyll-lacking cells contain chloroplasts that accumulate vesicles as well.

thus, possible variants of plastids inhibiting albino cells are proplastids, etioplasts or damaged chloroplasts that do not contain chlorophyll. gene expression levels exhibit little correlation with protein composition of etioplasts. further investigation is required in order to specify plastid numbers and structure in albino cells.

despite being state-of-the-art method, rna-seq and transcriptome analysis should not be implemented without aid from other techniques of investigation, such as microscopy and proteomic and metabolomic analysis. to uncover the mechanisms of partial albino phenotype formation in this particular case further examination is required, namely microscopic analysis in order to clarify plastid number, structure and location in albino cells. since expression of most plastid genes is regulated on post-transcriptional stages, proteomic analysis can give insight into actual protein content of the albino cells and shed light into coordination between plastid genes transcription and actual levels of their protein products.

finally, it is suspected that, since transition from proplastid to chloroplast occurs during organogenesis, transcriptomic analysis of a formed organ is unlikely to reveal genetic background of phenotype formation. to detect genetic mechanisms behind albino lemma and pericarp phenotype formation, earlier stages of organ development, at which chloroplast genesis in plants of bowman line occurs, should be examined and compared.
