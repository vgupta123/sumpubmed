BACKGROUND
comparison of closely related bacterial genomes has been useful for the study of genome evolution over small time scales and identification of lateral gene transfer events and strain-specific genes
 <cit> . comparative analysis of different strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa has shown that their genomes are mosaics consisting of a conserved component  interrupted by blocks of variable genes  located in limited chromosomal locations
 <cit> . it has been proposed that p. aeruginosa shapes its accessory genome to favor survival in a wide range of ecological niches, which represents a major evolutionary force influencing genome composition
 <cit> .

comparative studies of tailed bacteriophage genome sequences have shown a pervasive mosaic genetic architecture, presumably arising from extensive horizontal exchanges and non-homologous genetic recombination of ancestral sequences . interestingly, the genomes of several bacteriophage groups consist of conserved and variable genes
, like those of bacteria, suggesting that they emerged by a similar evolutionary mechanism. genes that encode interacting proteins, such as virion structural genes, are usually arranged in continuous modules rarely interrupted by non-homologous recombination. there is evidence for exchange of large blocks of genes that produce fully functional phages that are different from the inferred parents
 <cit> . a type of accessory genes are the so-called "morons" , usually single coding regions flanked by a transcription promoter and terminator that are inserted between two adjacent genes in related phages
 <cit> . the nucleotide composition of morons is usually different from that of adjacent genes arguing about the recent acquisition of the elements from a different source. in some cases morons are lysogenic conversion genes expressed from the repressed prophage and apparently conferring a selective benefit on the prophage by benefiting the host.

bacteriophage mu, which infects escherichia coli, is the prototype of various temperate phages found in other bacterial species. phages d <dig> and b <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa, resemble mu in that they lysogenize by integrating their genomes at almost random positions in the host chromosome, their dna replicates by transposition and their viral particles contain heterogeneous segments of host dna attached at both termini of the phage genomes
. the viral particles of d <dig> and b <dig> have isometric icosahedral heads like mu, but their long flexible tails differ from the contractile tail typical of mu
 <cit> . although these three phage genomes follow the module order lysis-lysogeny, transposition-replication and virion morphogenesis
 <cit> , their sequence diverges at the nucleotide level. indeed, d <dig> and b <dig> are not closely related phages as they are homologous for only  <dig>  kb near their right termini
 <cit>  and b <dig> presents a notable genetic rearrangement in the left arm of its genome relative to those of d <dig> and mu
 <cit> .

mu-like prophage sequences have been described in haemophilus, neisseria and deinococcus
 <cit> . recently, many more p. aeruginosa mu-like phage genomic sequences have been filed in the public databases, but we are unaware of efforts to compare these genomes and investigate the degree of diversity existing among them. in this work we sequenced the genomes of two locally isolated p. aeruginosa mu-like phages whose sequences were similar to those of the d <dig> group. analysis of these and other annotated genomes revealed that they bear a common set of conserved genes representing most of the genome and a smaller group of short variable genes located in several specific loci. following the p. aeruginosa terminology, the common set of genes is called “the core genome”, and the group of variable orfs, which is different for each phage, is called “the accessory genome”; the sum of core and accessory genomes is “the pangenome”. we speculate that the accessory genes are acquired by horizontal transfer and that they increase the survival capacity of the phage by improving its adaptation to the particular conditions imposed by the ecology of its host.

RESULTS
general features of the phages pamx <dig> and h70
we studied two pseudomonas aeruginosa temperate phages, pamx <dig> isolated from an environmental water sample
 <cit>  and h <dig> rescued from a clinical strain. both virions were morphologically siphophages with isometric heads  and long flexible tails  . results of dna sequence and gene organization of both phage genomes showed that they are homologous and largely syntenic, i.e., they share similar distribution of homologous genes . the genome sequence of pamx73
 <cit>  had  <dig> orfs in  <dig>  bp and that of h <dig> presented  <dig> orfs in  <dig>  bp. the overall gc content of both genomes was 64%, slightly lower than the 66% of the p. aeruginosa host strain pa14
 <cit> . a combined search with different programs  revealed six putative transcriptional promoters located at the same relative positions in each phage genome: p <dig> and p <dig> in the negative strand  and p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> in the positive strand . the promoters p <dig> and p <dig>  located close to the genome ends are oriented outward suggesting that they would transcribe bacterial dna next to the prophage ends. not all the putative promoters showed typical - <dig> and - <dig> consensus sequences but most of them presented one or two binding motifs for p. aeruginosa transcriptional factors .figure  <dig>

nucleotide level comparison of
p. aeruginosa
mu-like phage genomes. the p. aeruginosa mu-like phage genomes of a) pamx <dig> and b), dms <dig> were aligned with their relatives using blastn. the query genome is represented by the continuous grey bar and the subject genomes are displayed as discontinuous red bars. location of regions of genomic plasticity  is indicated in each query genome. the fine grey line gaps in the red bars represent non homologous regions to the query genome. some of these gaps coincide with lows in the graph of gc content distribution shown above the query genomes. the percentage of overall nucleotide sequence identity relative to the query genome is shown on the right margin for each phage sequence. the scale below the alignments represents length in nucleotides. putative promoters identified in pamx <dig> are marked with black arrows above and below the corresponding genome. c) neighbor-joining tree of the p. aeruginosa mu-like phage genomes based on a multiple alignment performed with the mauve program. the numbers at the branch points indicate the bootstrap values represented as the percentage observed from  <dig> replicas. the tree topology separates the compared phage genomes in two similarity groups whose prototypes are pamx <dig> and dms <dig>  the country of isolation for each phage sequence is indicated on the right of figure along with the similarity group designation.



sequence homology among pamx <dig>  h <dig> and mu-like related genomes
blastn alignments showed that pamx <dig> and h <dig> genomes were 87% identical to each other and homologous, to a lesser degree, with other p. aeruginosa phage genomes in public databases. these genomes corresponded either to vegetative phages  or to putative prophages within bacterial genomes  . all these genomes are organized in functional modules similar to those described for d <dig>  a temperate phage 
 <cit> . d <dig> and mp <dig> are phages whose genome structures resemble that of coliphage mu
 <cit> : a left module containing genes involved in the control of early gene expression and transposition-replication, a short middle regulatory region of late genes’ expression, and the right or late region containing morphogenesis genes. the putative promoter positions in the pamx <dig> genome map  also match most of the proposed promoter sites in mu and d <dig> genomes
 <cit> . note that three of the analyzed genomes seemed incomplete as compared with the rest of the group : the putative prophage in ncgm <dig>  which lacked around 2000 bp of the left end relative to the other genomes, probably due to a prophage partial deletion; pa1/kor, about 2000 bp short in the left end
 <cit> ; and the genome of d <dig> missing about <dig> bp at the right end, probably trimmed away during sequence assembly
 <cit> .

the mechanism of transposition-replication has been reported as the hallmark of the mu-like phages
 <cit> . in phage mu, three imperfect repeat sequences close to both genome ends are recognized by its transposase
 <cit> . therefore, we inspected the end regions of the phage genomes compared here for the presence of putative transposase binding sites. in all the genomes three 22 bp conserved putative binding sites were found in tandem next to the ends, except in the incomplete genomes mentioned above. the three binding sites at the left genome end, named l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  corresponded to imperfect direct repeats located at  <dig>   <dig> and 124 bp from the end, whereas imperfect repeats r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> were positioned at  <dig>   <dig> and 93 bp from the right genome end. in this case, r <dig> was inverted relative to r <dig> and r <dig> . all the sequences and positions for the putative transposase binding sites were well conserved in consistency with the sequence conservation of the putative transposase a gene .

the triplet 5'-tgt, identified at the genome ends of mp22
 <cit> , has been reported as conserved in mu-like phages of several bacterial groups
 <cit> . we inspected the ends of the mu-like phage genomes compared here looking for these terminal sequences. the triplet 5'-tgt was identified at the termini of pamx <dig> and h <dig> during their genomic assemblies  and, except for the incomplete genomes mentioned above, the triplet was present in all the genome ends examined in this work. the 5'-tg in the mu genome has been shown to be important for assembly of a stable transposome complex
 <cit> .

short heterogeneous sequences,  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides long, of p. aeruginosa genomic dna were recognized flanking the genome ends of pamx <dig> and h <dig> beyond the 5’-tgt sequences . as in phage mu, these host terminal sequences represent remnants of host dna packaged in the virions, as relics of the mechanism of phage dna replication by transposition
 <cit> . host dna sequences as long as 2 kb have been reported at the right end of d <dig> genome
 <cit> . thus, the shorter length of host dna segments attached to the right end of the phage genomes was presumably an artifact resulting from the shotgun fragmentation process carried out on the phage dnas before sequencing.

the core and accessory genomes of the analyzed phages
all vs all blastn alignments of the twelve phage genomes indicated that long homologous segments were interspersed with short non-homologous regions, often located at the same relative positions . the long homologous segments, mainly contained conserved orfs over more than 90% identical among the compared genomes. in contrast, the non-homologous segments contained either different sets of short non-conserved orfs or functionally conserved genes with heterogeneous sequences. the regularity of the similarity patterns, particularly clear in the genomic right arm regions of pamx <dig> and dms <dig> , prompted us to organize the phage genomes in a neighbor joining tree . the result showed two main branches, each with six phage genomes: group  <dig> represented by the genome of pamx <dig> and group  <dig> by that of dms <dig>  the set of conserved genes will be referred to as the “core genome” and the short non-conserved orfs will be denoted as the “accessory genome”  following mathee et al., for the genome structure described for p. aeruginosa
 <cit> . the sites where the accessory genes were found will be called “regions of genomic plasticity” or rpgs 
 <cit> . the sum of core and accessory genomes was named the “pangenome” of this group of phages
 <cit> . as discussed below , there seems to be more than a simple analogy between the concepts of phage and bacterial pangenomes.

phage genomes containing core and variable components have been described for lambdoid phages
 <cit> , a group of t4-like phages
 <cit>  and cyanophages
 <cit> . the structure of the genomes described here formally parallels that of these phage genomes: the compared genomes share a core interrupted by several variable regions. in the t4-like group the core region primarily includes homologues of essential t <dig> genes, and the variable genome, located in specific loci named hyper plastic regions , contains mostly small genes of unknown function. nonetheless it is known that some of them encode adaptive functions that allow the phage to elude host exclusion systems . it has been proposed that the core genes have evolved by vertical inheritance whereas the accessory genes have been horizontally transferred
 <cit> . thus, genomes with core and accessory components seem a common evolutionary strategy for both, temperate and virulent phages.

it has been speculated that variable gene regions in phage genomes are acquired by horizontal transfer and recombination at sites that do not interfere with the expression of essential genes
 <cit> . variable gene inserts often coincide with deviations in gc content along the genome indicating recent acquisition
 <cit> . pamx <dig> and dms <dig> genomes showed an average gc content of  <dig> % but two of their variable regions  corresponded with valleys of gc content as low as  <dig> % . inspection of the sequences flanking the different rpgs in the same genome, or the same type of rpgs in different genomes, did not lead to recognize sequences that could suggest a common recombinase target. as in the case of morons, the mechanism of acquisition of variable genes is mysterious
 <cit> .

assignment of functions to orfs in the phage genomes
based on homology to functional domains, and to amino acid sequences of phage proteins in the data bank, putative functions were assigned to fourteen orfs in the genomes of pamx <dig> and h <dig> . these conserved orfs were related to regulation of gene expression, dna replication and virion morphogenesis.

to assign the structural proteins to specific orfs in the pamx <dig> genome, the proteins in the virion were analyzed by mass spectrometry. pamx <dig> viral particles were banded in cscl density gradients and their component proteins resolved through sds-page. the stained bands were eluted, trypsin digested and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry 
 <cit> . thirteen proteins were identified as products of pamx <dig> genes as they matched with the predicted products of the phage genome . these results confirmed the proteins predicted by sequence homology for five orf products . the other eight proteins corresponded to genes located in the tail genome region, except accessory orf h located in the head module . to obtain further insights into the function of the newly identified virion structural proteins, we used the i-tasser platform to predict their 3d structures and functions by homology to physically solved protein structures
 <cit>  . quality 3d models  were obtained for the virion structural proteins encoded in orf  <dig> , orfs  <dig> and  <dig> , orf  <dig> , orf  <dig>  and orf h  . orfs  <dig> and  <dig> did not have significant 3d models. the tail termination protein of phage lambda stops polymerization of the tail tube when the precise tail length is reached and subsequently provides the surface of interaction with the virion head
 <cit> . the tail spike proteins of several phages play key roles in the host cell recognition and dna entry by binding and cleaving the primary receptors of the cell wall
. in addition, it has been reported that some phage tails carry glycoside hydrolase domains to degrade the cell wall previous to dna entry
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
assignation of pamx <dig> virion proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. the protein components of pamx <dig> purified virions were resolved by sds-page and stained with coomassie brilliant blue. a molecular weight marker was included for reference in the left lane. the virion proteins were assigned by mass spectrometry to the corresponding orfs . all core orfs are numbered as in figure 
 <dig>  orf h was the only accessory orf that was part of the virion. after the orf numbers, in parenthesis, appears the percentage of amino acid sequence coverage obtained in the assay and the theoretical molecular weight of the identified protein.
pangenome map of the phages examined. the map represents the core genome of the phages analyzed here. the core genome is the collection of conserved orfs represented by color arrows and numbered  <dig> to  <dig> below the map. color code for arrows denotes: red, assigned function; green, unknown function, and purple, virion structural proteins identified by mass spectrometry in pamx <dig> particles. the regions of genomic plasticity, rgps a to i above the map , indicate the location of the accessory genes in the pangenome. the individual accessory orfs for each genome are indicated in low case font a to i below the corresponding rgps. anti-crispr-related genes
 <cit>  detected by sequence homology are encircled in orange. notice that accessory orf g <dig> is associated with all known anti-crispr genes
 <cit> . functions assigned by sequence homology to known phage proteins are indicated above the map. the functional modules in the pangenome are indicated by brackets on top of the figure.



core genome
the blastp comparative analysis of the twelve phage genomes examined here revealed that  <dig> orfs are conserved in most of the phages  , except for the three incomplete genomes mentioned above . of these,  <dig> orfs had assigned functions  whereas  <dig> orfs remained unassigned . a list of putative functions encoded by the core orfs is presented in additional file
 <dig>  twelve of the thirteen proteins identified by mass spectrometry in the pamx <dig> virion were assigned to specific orfs in the core genome since they had homologs in all the mu-like genomes analyzed . in contrast, the virion protein encoded by gene h , located between core orfs  <dig>  and  <dig>  , had homologs only in the genomes of similarity group  <dig> . we suggest that gene h could have been lost in the genomes of similarity group  <dig> from a group  <dig> ancestor because it encodes a structural homolog of a head decoration protein , therefore it seems to belong to the head module of the phage genome.

most homologous core orfs were  <dig> to 100% identical at the amino acid level among the compared genomes, but core orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  were highly similar only among members of each of the two similarity groups  and with lower sequence identity levels  between members of different similarity groups. additionally, there were orfs that showed poor overall sequence conservation even among the members of the same similarity group. these orfs, corresponding to the putative repressors, ner-like proteins and terminases, exhibited 54%, 65% and 36% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. other putative gene products with variable sequence, but unassigned function, were those encoded by core orfs  <dig> and  <dig> . high variability of repressor and antirepressor  sequences has been observed in the stx-like coliphages
 <cit>  whereas the sequence variability between the repressors of d <dig> and mp <dig> has been associated with the absence of cross-immunity
 <cit> . thus, the variation among the putative repressors observed here, likely indicates that these p. aeruginosa mu-like phages belong to different immunity groups.

orfs previously overlooked in the phage genomes
the comparative analysis of a group of homologous genomes facilitates detection of errors and improves annotations
 <cit> . the gene-by-gene comparison results and the synteny shared by the mu-like phage genomes, allowed us to identify  <dig> orfs that had been overlooked in the original annotations of the ten genomes obtained from the data bases . these previously unidentified orfs encoded either core or accessory genes . in other cases it was noticed that a reported orf might be shorter than homologous orfs due to stop codons likely created by sequencing or assembly mistakes . additionally, based on synteny and similarity with genes of phage mu and the presence of functional domains, we assigned the functions of gema, mor and terminase to the core orfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . note that these functional assignations represent revised versions of the original annotations in other phage genomes of this group
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
genome comparison between
escherichia coli
phage mu and pamx <dig>  the genome maps of phage mu, modified from
 <cit> , and pamx <dig> are drawn to scale. the orfs in both maps are represented by color coded arrows, as in figure 
 <dig>  adding the yellow arrows that represent accessory orfs. putative promoters identified in pamx <dig> and those reported for mu
 <cit>  are marked with angled black arrows. some genes above phage mu map are labeled with the functions that they encode
 <cit> . core orfs in pamx <dig> genome are numbered and the position of the regions of genome plasticity, rgps a to i is indicated. the orfs of mu and pamx <dig> were compared using blastp and the orfs showing sequence similarity are connected by cyan lines between the two maps. the percentages of sequence similarity between the connected genes are indicated. black lines connect orfs encoding the same function, but showed no sequence homology.



accessory genome
the accessory genome of the revised mu-like phages contained mainly orfs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> codons that were either phage specific or shared by several phage genomes . the accessory orfs were always located in the phage genome at positions that corresponded to non-homologous regions in the nucleotide sequence alignments . these regions of genomic plasticity  were mainly located in the left arm of the genomes and each contained from zero to six orfs . nine different rpgs were labeled ‘a to i’ in the genome maps and the different accessory orfs recognized within each rgp were identified by the corresponding lower case letter and consecutive number . each genome contained between  <dig> and  <dig> accessory orfs distributed among  <dig> to  <dig> rgps. note that with the exception of rgps c and g, the remaining regions contain only one orf and, therefore, they could be considered as regions of insertion-deletion or “indels”. these accessory genes could be examples of the morons described in lambdoid phages
 <cit> . one interesting example of morons increasing the phage fitness by aiding virion stability is provided by the genes encoding capsid decoration proteins in different phages
 <cit> . these genes have been considered accessory elements since they are absent in very closely related genomes and may be advantageous for the virions under certain conditions
 <cit> . for example, gpd and dec proteins in lambdoid phages confer virion stability against chelating agents
 <cit> , gpd provides mechanical reinforcement to withstand external physical stress in lambda
 <cit>  and soc in t <dig> confers capsid resistance against high ph and thermal challenges
 <cit> . despite proteins h of pamx <dig> and gpd of lambda do not show sequence similarity, their genes are syntenic, ie., they are located between the genes encoding protease-scaffold and major head proteins in the corresponding genomes
 <cit> . in addition, proteins h, gpd and the decoration protein dec of phage l, also present similar molecular mass . based on the above coincidences, we suggest that protein h represents a new capsid decoration protein although additional experimental characterization will be necessary to validate this proposal.

overall,  <dig> types of accessory orfs were identified . the estimated size of the accessory genome in each phage represented between  <dig> to 10% of the genome. these non-homologous regions may have been acquired by recombination mediated by red-like functions. short sequences with as little as 78% of identity are used by red-like functions to recombine short dna segments into lambdoid phage genomes
 <cit> . a detailed analysis of the sequences flanking the accessory orfs in mu-like genomes is needed to speculate about the mechanism of heterologous gene gaining. furthermore, it has been shown that lambdoid phages encoding their own recombination system bear more mosaic genomes and possess more diverse gene repertoires than those lambdoid phages that do not encode any recombinase, thus increasing the phage diversity and facilitating the possible adaptation to the host
 <cit> .

taking into account the number and type of accessory orfs present in each genome, no two genomes were identical. the accessory orfs c <dig> and c <dig> were shared by most phages, in contrast, orfs c <dig>  d <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> were unique for a phage . it is possible that accessory genes in the mu-like genomes are acquired by horizontal gene transfer and selected through the specific developmental history of each phage
 <cit> . the majority of accessory orfs recognized here seems to be restricted to p. aeruginosa mu-like phage genomes  and do not have an assigned function. however, some of them seem to confer selective advantages to the phage. it has been recently reported that genes  <dig> and  <dig> of phage d <dig>  corresponding to g <dig> and g <dig> in rgp g , and gene  <dig> of phage mp <dig>  corresponding to g <dig>  encode proteins that inhibit the crispr/cas system of p. aeruginosa
 <cit> . the presence of these accessory genes confers phage the advantage of infecting strains of p. aeruginosa harboring an active crispr-cas system, a bacterial immunity system against phage infection
 <cit> . this function seems an adaptation to host conditions in an analogous way to the accessory genes encoding the internal proteins in phages p <dig> and t <dig> which prevent cell modification-restriction systems to act on the phage dna targets
 <cit> . other putative anti-crispr proteins were encoded in g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> in the phage genomes analyzed here
 <cit>  . interestingly, rgp g coincided with regions of low gc content  implying that anti-crispr genes were acquired recently by horizontal transfer
 <cit> . in addition, rgp f also coincided with regions of low gc content for phage genomes bearing f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> genes.figure  <dig> 
homologue frequencies for the mu-like pangenome orfs in the data bank. the orfs in the pangenome of the p. aeruginosa mu-like phages were analyzed by blastp to determine the number of homologues in the non-redundant ncbi database. the number of homologues identified for each orf in viruses  or bacteria  is plotted on the graph. the core orfs , corresponding to those in pamx <dig> genome, are labeled in black whereas the accessory orfs  of different phage genomes  are labeled in blue and the corresponding bars shaded in green. the bars corresponding to orfs encoding virion proteins identified by mass spectrometry in pamx <dig> are shaded in purple. three orfs matching eukaryota homologues are indicated with asterisks  above the corresponding bars. no homologues were found in archaea. functions inferred for some orfs are under the corresponding label. functional modules are indicated by brackets above the histogram and the gene order in the graph is represented as in the phage genomes.



rgp c, which clusters several orfs, is reminiscent of the ninr region of phages λ, hk <dig>  hk <dig> and p22
 <cit> . these phage genomes bear a group of about ten orfs between genes p and q. like the orfs in rgps c, the genes in the nin region are short, less than  <dig> codons long, closely packed together, dispensable, and unique or shared only among some members of the group. as proposed for nin genes
 <cit> , function of genes in rgps c and g may help phages to adapt to the particular host they infect. the genes rexa, rexb and ren of phage lambda may also represent examples of accessory genes conferring a selective advantage. the rex genes encode a two-component exclusion system that inhibits the growth of other phages infecting lambda lysogens
 <cit> . the gene product of ren prevents lambda from self-exclusion
 <cit> . it has been proposed that acquisition of novel metabolic capabilities in p. aeruginosa through horizontal gene transfer appears to be a key evolutionary force shaping the bacterial genome which is reflected in the genome plasticity of individual strains
 <cit> . we and other authors
 <cit>  propose that a similar mechanism rules the genomes of the phages in their adaptation to the particular host exclusion functions.

distribution of homologues for the mu-like pangenome orfs in the data bank
to investigate about the nature and origin of core and accessory genes we looked for the frequency of homologous genes for each orf through blastp searches against the non-redundant ncbi database . bacterial and viral sequences accounted for almost all the homologues detected in the database . several orfs had homologues across a variety of bacterial species but, interestingly, the core genes had matches mainly from pseudomonas genomes whereas the accessory genes had matches from the pseudomonas genera and other most distant bacterial species. on average, the orfs in the core genome had about three fold more homologues than the accessory orfs  underscoring the essentiality of core gene functions. on the contrary, accessory orfs generally had a lower number of homologues  with the exception of orfs d <dig>  h and i which showed about  <dig> matches or more each. notice that these exceptions suggest that such orfs could have been originally core genes that were lost from the phage genomes under conditions where they were dispensable. these orfs represent interesting candidates to elucidate their function. orf h, which may encode the capsid decoration protein in the mu-like phages of the similarity group  <dig> , could represent a core head gene that was lost from the phage genomes of the similarity group  <dig> . our analysis confirms the observation concerning the low number of homologues to anti-cripsr genes in the databases suggesting that they are specific for mu-like phages and other mobile genetic elements of p. aeruginosa
 <cit> . note that these results are restricted to the sequences available in the non-redundant ncbi database, therefore a sampling bias exist for the homologues to core and accessory orfs.

genome comparison between p. aeruginosamu-like phage pamx <dig> and coliphage mu
in spite the genomic homology observed among the p. aeruginosa mu-like phages analyzed here, a blastn comparison between the genomic sequences of pamx <dig> and coliphage mu
 <cit>  revealed no significant sequence similarity. yet, the two genomes showed similar functional modular organization. based on blastp searches, twelve orfs in the left arm of pamx <dig> genome corresponded to homologous genes in the left arm of the mu genome. these genes encode transcriptional regulation, replicative transposition and head morphogenesis proteins in mu and show between  <dig> to 63% amino acid similarity with their corresponding homologues in pamx <dig> . however, there were about twenty short orfs without assigned functions in the mu and pamx <dig> left arm regions that did not show homology. total genome comparison revealed that the right genomic arms of both phages were different in sequence, orf number and size. this was expected because the right genome arms encode the tail genes and the two phages differ strikingly in tail morphology. mu shows the contractile tail of myophages whereas pamx <dig> has the flexible tail typical of siphophages . interestingly, the genomic right arms of mu and mu-like myophages that infect other bacterial genera are homologous in gene distribution, size and sequence
 <cit> . since h <dig> , d <dig> and mp <dig> phages have also been characterized as siphophages
 <cit> , the flexible tail is apparently a unique feature of this group of p. aeruginosa mu-like viruses. this appears to represent an interesting case of mosaicism between phages of different lineages.

we looked for three other genomic features of mu in p. aeruginosa mu-like phages: 1) the invertible g segment, 2) the in-frame translational start of the scaffolding protein within the protease gene and 3) the translational frameshift in the overlapping tail assembly genes
 <cit> . as expected, no g invertible segment was identified among the mu-like tail genes as the tail structure of this group of syphophages is totally different from the mu tail. however, a putative internal start site in the protease-encoding gene  <dig> of pamx <dig> was identified at val  <dig> codon that could be the initiator of the scaffolding protein because it is preceded by a plausible shine-dalgarno sequence  by a  <dig> nucleotide spacer. in spite of the sequence divergence observed between these protease/scaffolding genes and those of mu , they show similar lengths, their internal start sites are located at the same relative positions and their corresponding shine-dalgarno sequences are placed to eight bases from the start codons . concerning the third feature, the putative overlapping tail assembly genes in pamx <dig> could correspond to core orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  a slippery sequence t ttt ttc
 <cit>  was located at codons  <dig> to  <dig> of core orf  <dig>   <dig> codons ahead of the stop codon  overlapping the core orf  <dig> putative initiation codon . this configuration would require a - <dig> frameshifting to read both core orfs as a unique gene conforming the majority of frameshift sequences analyzed for the tail assembly genes of many phages leaving the - <dig> frameshift for the mu genes as exceptional
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the genomic characterization of two locally isolated pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages showed that they belong to a family of phages and putative prophages of clinical strains reported worldwide, the prototype of which is d <dig>  the genomic nucleotide sequences of a dozen phages of this group were  <dig> to 90% identical among themselves, but in regard to the distribution of predicted protein sequences, they were highly syntenic. from a broader perspective, the genomic features indicated that the phages resembled coliphage mu, however, their tail is flexible and not contractile like those of mu and mu-like phages of other bacterial species. the genomes compared here had long homologous regions interspersed with short heterologous blocks. the long conserved regions, which represent most of each genome, contained essential genes encoding replication and regulatory functions and structural proteins of the viral particles, whereas the genes located in the heterologous blocks were variable for each phage and presumably non-essential on the used plating host. this group of accessory genes, which seem to be acquired by horizontal transfer, may represent a selective advantage for the phages. remarkably, among these were anti-crispr genes, which permit certain infections of hosts harbouring the crispr-cas immunity system and a gene encoding a putative decoration protein that could be involved in the capsid stability. these observations extend to another group of phages the concept of “pangenome”, the sum of core and accessory genomes, not only in the way that they are distributed in the chromosomes, but also in their functional and evolutionary implications for phage biology.
