BACKGROUND
ferredoxin  is the name given to a variety of small proteins binding inorganic clusters organized around two to four iron atoms and a complementary number of sulfur atoms  <cit> . complete genomic sequences have revealed the presence of a very large number of genes encoding such proteins, mainly in bacteria and archaea  <cit> .

fdxs are most often assigned electron transfer roles and some of them occupy central positions in metabolism  <cit> , but the roles of a majority of fdxs remain unknown  <cit> . functional substitution among fdxs may occur, and other soluble electron shuttles, such as flavodoxins, may act as fdx-substitutes. this is the case upon iron starvation for a  <dig> fdx in glycolytic clostridia  <cit>  or a  fdx in some photosynthetic organisms  <cit> , for instance. despite this apparent functional redundancy, most sequenced genomes display a wealth of genes encoding various fdxs. for example, the reference pao <dig> strain of the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  has at least  <dig> genes encoding fdxs of different families. a flavodoxin  is also present in this strain. it is often unclear in which reactions fdxs are involved and which biological function relies on a given fdx.

one of p. aeruginosa fdxs is encoded by the pa <dig> locus  and it belongs to a separated family of proteins containing two  clusters  <cit> . the sequences of proteins of this family are characterized by a segment of six amino acids between two cysteine ligands of one cluster and a c terminal extension of more than  <dig> amino acids beyond the last ligand of the other cluster . the structure of this fdx  <cit>  shows that these two characteristic peptides fold as a particular turn close to one cluster and as a turn and a long α-helix, respectively . the first member of this family  to be identified was that of the purple sulfur γ-proteobacterium allochromatium vinosum, originally named chromatium vinosum, and it was initially classified among other  'bacterial' fdxs   <cit> . it was later found that the characteristic sequence differences of proteins of the alvinfdx family shifted the reduction potential of the  clusters to very negative values, below - <dig> mv with reference to the normal hydrogen electrode, with one reaching - <dig> mv or less  <cit> . because of this unusual property, it is not easy to find an efficient physiological reductant for such proteins, especially in non-photosynthetic organisms. additional unique spectroscopic  <cit>  and structural  <cit>  properties have also been evidenced in these proteins.

a well defined function for members of this family of fdxs has only been found in bacteria catabolizing aromatic compounds in the absence of oxygen  <cit> . the thauera aromatica fdx participates in an electron transfer chain, as electron acceptor from 2-oxoglutarate:fdx oxidoreductase and donor to benzoyl-coa reductase  <cit> . however, this particular fdx displays the less negative reduction potentials among fdxs of the alvinfdx family  <cit> , and this catabolic pathway is not always present in all bacteria containing fdx genes .

since the role of fdxs of the alvinfdx family is not known in most bacteria , the importance of the fdx <dig> gene of the p. aeruginosa pa <dig> locus has been investigated in the present work. the possibility of endogenous in vivo functional substitution has been examined by removing the chromosomal copy of the gene. also, the main properties of fdx <dig> expression have been explored and the distribution of similar genes has been analyzed in the available sequence databases. these newly obtained data strongly indicate a non-exchangeable and housekeeping function for fdx <dig> 

RESULTS
in silico inventory of genes encoding alvinfdx
the signature of alvinfdx sequences encompasses two components. first, a 6- <dig> amino acids insertion separates two iron-coordinating cysteines of one cluster, whereas  clusters in fdxs are usually bound by a stretch of three cysteines, two residues apart in the sequence. second, a 27- <dig> amino acids fragment, following the last coordinating cysteine at the c-terminus, partly folds as an α-helix . over the last  <dig> years, extensive genome sequencing has revealed numerous fdx genes encoding protein sequences with characteristics of the alvinfdx family, but no systematic inventory has been carried out. peptidic insertions may change the properties of proteins in unpredictable ways, as exemplified by the large differences between the fdxs studied here and more conventional, shorter   <dig>  ones  <cit> . therefore, the present analysis is restricted to proteins of no more than  <dig> amino acids showing the above two sequence features.

genes encoding proteins with the above characteristics in the sequence databanks were only found in the bacterial domain: more than  <dig> such genes were detected. although archaea are a very abundant source of iron-sulfur proteins, no genes encoding proteins of the alvinfdx family, as precisely defined above, could be identified in this domain. within bacteria, the occurrence of fdx genes was restricted to chloroflexi , to nitrospirae , and to the proteobacteria. in the latter phylum, all α to ε classes were represented , but with noteworthy differences. all fully sequenced species of β- and ε- proteobacteria displayed the fdx gene, which was also present in a large number of, but not all, γ-proteobacteria. in contrast, the fdx gene was found in only a minority of the δ-proteobacteria genera , and in only one species, rhodopseudomonas palustris, of α-proteobacteria.

genomic organization of alvin-like fdx genes
in rhodopseudomonas palustris  <cit> , and in the denitrifying β-proteobacteria, thauera aromatica  <cit>  and azoarcus sp. strain cib  <cit> , the fdx gene belongs to a cluster of genes involved in anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds . in thauera aromatica, fdx receives electrons from 2-oxoglutarate:fdx oxidoreductase and donates them to benzoyl-coa reductase, the atp-dependent dearomatizing enzyme  <cit> . by similarity, the fdx gene likely belongs to a catabolic operon  <cit>  in the other anaerobic benzoate-degrading bacteria displaying clustered homologous genes  <cit> .

a case of interest is that of azoarcus sp. ebn <dig>  which anaerobically degrades aromatics and displays a ferredoxin gene  in the bcr  genomic cluster  <cit> . although it most probably binds two  clusters, the "fxd" ferredoxin does not have the sequence characteristics of fdx . furthermore, in another part of the genome downstream of the pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase gene , azoarcus sp. ebn <dig> does have a fdx gene , potentially encoding a fdx of the alvinfdx family. thus it seems unlikely that the latter fdx participates in the anaerobic degradation of aromatics in this bacterium.

the coad gene was found on the 5' side of fdx in several bacteria including p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  however, the involvement of fdx in the reaction catalyzed by phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase has not been demonstrated, and the very high-energy electrons fdx may provide are not required in the coa biosynthetic pathway. thus, coad and fdx <dig> do not need to be functionally linked. furthermore, coad and fdx <dig> are not always close in the sequences of many genomes, in e. coli k12-mg <dig> for instance , and the layout around fdx is highly variable . in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  a gene encoding a probable γ-glutamyltranspeptidase is located 3' of fdx <dig>  this is also the case for some other strains of p.aeruginosa and for bacteria of the xanthomonas and xylella genera, but this layout is not largely conserved, even within the pseudomonas genus . therefore, the transcriptional characteristics of fdx, not belonging to bcr clusters, have been explored.

transcription of fdx genes encoding alvin-like fdxs
northern blot analysis of p. aeruginosa mrna revealed a single band of less than  <dig> nt hybridizing with a fdx <dig> probe , both in the pao <dig> and cha strains. the small size of the p. aeruginosa fdx <dig> transcript indicates that the transcription start site must be close to the coding sequence and that it is monocistronic.

the  <dig> kb regions 5' of the coding sequences of the e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and helicobacter pylori fdxs do not share recognition sequences for common transcription factors. promoter activity of the 5' sequence of e. coli yfhl  was qualitatively reported before  <cit> . we also detected the yfhl, i.e. fdx, mrna by rt-pcr .

to look for regulation, measurements of the p. aeruginosa fdx <dig> mrna levels have been carried out under different conditions. it was found that the relative expression of fdx increased along the growth phase . since p. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, we wondered whether fdx <dig> expression was also triggered during host-bacterium interaction or co-regulated with other virulence factors. calcium depletion by egta to chemically induce synthesis of the type  <dig> secretion system   <cit> , a major virulence factor of p. aeruginosa, did not change the expression of fdx <dig> . t3ss is naturally induced when bacteria contact host cells  <cit> . yet, p. aeruginosa cells in the presence of macrophages showed similar amounts of fdx <dig> mrna, relative to rrna, from the time of contact up to  <dig> hours later .

to get insight into the promoter region of the p. aeruginosa fdx <dig> gene, the fragment   was transcriptionally fused to the promoter-less lacz gene . this construction, which contains a 5' truncated version of the coad coding sequence, was introduced in the attb site of the p. aeruginosa cha genome. the  fragment was found to promote lacz transcription. transcription of fdx <dig> was independent of calcium depletion and of the presence of exsa , the key transcription factor of t3ss genes, in agreement with the results of rt-pcr experiments . along the growth curve, β-galactosidase activity rose from  <dig> miller units at early logarithmic phase to more than  <dig> when reaching the stationary phase , again in agreement with the results of rt-pcr experiments .

another construction with  <dig> bp, instead of  <dig> bp, upstream of the fdx <dig> coding sequence, and devoid of any coad sequence, gave ca.  <dig> fold lower activities, indicating that the  region enhances transcription of fdx <dig>  the number of miller units of β-galactosidase activity also increased with the biomass under the dependence of the shortened version of the promoter region , as was observed with the longer one. removing oxygen from a rich nitrate-containing medium did not change the difference between the long and shorter versions of the promoter region .

the carbon source , as well as the nitrogen one , in a minimal medium did not impact the β-galactosidase activity . since some fdxs of the alvinfdx family are involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds, p. aeruginosa was cultivated with 4-hydroxy benzoate as sole carbon source: in the presence of nitrate and without oxygen, p. aeruginosa did not grow, thus indicating that the catabolic benzoyl coa pathway is not present in this bacterium, in agreement with the lack of benzoyl coa reductase in the p. aeruginosa genome. this result excludes a single benzoyl coa-reducing role for fdx in all bacteria in which the fdx gene has been found . despite the very large number of fdx genes present in proteobacteria, proteins of the alvinfdx family have only been purified from allochromatium vinosum  <cit> , t. aromatica  <cit> , and azotobacter vinelandii  <cit> : growth of a. vinosum was on synthetic medium lacking aromatic compounds  <cit> , whereas benzoate was the unique carbon source of t. aromatica  <cit> . with oxygen as electron acceptor, p. aeruginosa grew on 4-hydroxy benzoate with expression of fdx <dig> at a rate similar to growth on glucose or pyruvate. this confirms that the aerobic pathway of 4-hydroxy benzoate catabolism is active in p. aeruginosa, but it does not require a larger fdx <dig> expression than for growth on glucose or pyruvate.

gene deletions
to assess the functional importance of p. aeruginosa fdx, inactivation of the fdx <dig> gene was carried out. the suicide plasmid pexΔfdx <dig> contained a fragment of  <dig> bp encompassing fdx <dig> from which the coding sequence between the sixth and the last  <dig> nucleotides was removed and replaced by a xhoi restriction site. two other plasmids in which a gmr cassette was cloned in both orientations, using this xhoi site, were also prepared. all three plasmids were introduced in the p. aeruginosa cha strain by homologous recombination. the use of the cassette-less construction aimed at avoiding any polar effect triggered by the introduced dna. numerous attempts at excising fdx <dig> consistently afforded the wild-type genotype: this suggests that fdx1-deleted bacteria were selected out with this experimental strategy. disrupting the p. aeruginosa fdx <dig> gene by directly integrating a pex100t-based suicide plasmid into the chromosomal coding sequence  also failed to afford viable mutants.

clones in which the genomic copy of fdx <dig> was deleted  only grew when a functional copy of the fdx <dig> gene was provided in trans, either on the pvlt-pfdxs plasmid  or on the pjn-fdx <dig> plasmid , prior to integrated-plasmid counter-selection. this procedure gave around 50% of clones in which the pa <dig> locus was deleted, as verified by pcr analysis. consistently, curing the mutants of the plasmid copy of fdx <dig> did not allow us to select colonies lacking the chromosomal copy of the gene. these results indicate that the plasmids bearing fdx <dig> rescued the cells that had lost chromosomal fdx <dig>  but complete lack of the gene was deleterious to p. aeruginosa growth. hence this gene is essential for the p. aeruginosa cha strain.

discussion
the fact that fdx <dig> is essential in p. aeruginosa challenges any speculation about its function. the present work shows that this gene is indeed expressed in p. aeruginosa , but little previous work addressed its regulation. the transcriptome subset varying between biofilm and planktonic cultures of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> has been reported  <cit> : fdx <dig> transcription was increased ca.  <dig> times in biofilms as compared to free living bacteria. however, such variations were not confirmed in another similar study  <cit> .

considering other members of the alvinfdx family, one of the two fdx genes in campylobacter jejuni  was found to be iron-regulated and involved in the aerobic survival of cells in the stationary phase  <cit> . the sequence of another fdx of this bacterium  is more similar to the fdx consensus. we could not demonstrate iron regulation for the single fdx gene of p. aeruginosa or e. coli , in line with previous results obtained with h. pylori  <cit>  and p. aeruginosa  <cit> . h. pylori strains are of particular interest since their only annotated ferredoxin gene is of the type discussed here. the encoded protein has been associated with metronidazole resistance, at least for some strains  <cit> , including because it is suspected to donate electrons to a nitroreductase  that is required to activate the drug. the observation that the gene could be deleted in some, but not all, h. pylori strains  <cit>  did not help assigning a function to fdx. in particular, the actual involvement of fdx as low potential electron shuttle between oxidoreductases in h. pylori as suggested  <cit>  remains to be clearly delineated since fdx proteins have been shown to be poor electron donors/acceptors in coupled reactions using such enzymes  <cit> . indeed, flavodoxin has been assigned this role in h. pylori and c. jejuni  <cit> . furthermore, the induced high-level expression of frxa resulting from the deletion of fdx in some h. pylori strains suggested a repressor function for fdx and additional important, but undefined, roles  <cit> .

the genome context around the fdx genes is not conserved in different bacteria, and evidence for transcription as part of an operon is lacking, with the exception of clusters of genes involved in the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa several, often putative, oxidoreductases can be identified in the analysis of the genome, and many low-potential electron transfer molecules coexist. p. aeruginosa fdx <dig> is transcribed as a short messenger in a constitutive-like manner, and our attempts at deleting fdx <dig> indicated that it belongs to the minority of essential genes  in this bacterium. this conclusion agrees with the absence of p. aeruginosa transposon mutants for pa <dig>  both in pao <dig> http://pseudomutant.pseudomonas.com/index.html and pa <dig> http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/parabiosys/projects/host-pathogen_interactions/library_construction.php libraries. an exception is in a library with phoa and lacz insertions, in which the pa <dig> locus was targeted in two mutants  <cit> . these insertions occur in the genomic sequence very close to the 3' end of the fdx <dig> orf. therefore, most of p. aeruginosa fdx should be synthesized in these mutants: the variability of the c-terminus among fdxs and inspection of the structure  indicate that the insertions should not completely inactivate fdx in these mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented herein demonstrate that donation of electrons to benzoyl-coa reductase cannot be the sole function of ferredoxins of the alvinfdx family. the lethality of fdx <dig> removal indicates that functional substitution of fdx by other proteins of p. aeruginosa does not occur, maybe because the product of fdx <dig> fulfils other functions than conventional electron transfer between redox enzymes. this possibility was previously inferred by changes in frxa expression upon fdx removal in strains of h. pylori  <cit> . similar suggestions arose from various kinds of data obtained with other small iron-sulfur proteins, such as thioredoxin-like ferredoxins  <cit>  and the  isc-associated fdx of e. coli in the secretion of cytotoxic necrotizing factor  <dig>  <cit> . potential regulating mechanisms involving fdx cannot be discussed at this stage, but they may include stabilization of proteins or protein complexes, electron exchange with redox-sensitive regulators, and others.

as detailed above, many bacteria of the proteobacteria phylum, such as francisella tularensis, neisseria meningitidis, or yersinia pestis among many, contain the fdx gene and they are human pathogens. if this gene is essential in many of them, as shown here for p. aeruginosa, proteins of the alvinfdx family may provide new targets for future antibiotics.
