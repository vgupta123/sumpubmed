BACKGROUND
angiogenesis, the physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels, is a primordial process in development. the complex network of interactions between pro- and anti-angiogenic regulators dictates that any imbalance in this process can lead to disease. indeed, angiogenesis plays a central role in the pathophysiology of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and several heart diseases . angiogenin , a potent in vivo inducer of angiogenesis, was first isolated in a systematic search for angiogenic factors secreted by human ht- <dig> colon adenocarcinoma cells  <cit> . its increased expression was subsequently documented in different tumors and in several instances correlated with the disease progression and aggressiveness . the use of antibodies  <cit> , antisense targeting  <cit>  and inhibitors  <cit>  has proven useful in inhibiting the establishment, progression and metastasis of tumors in mouse models, thereby establishing ang as a promising target for anticancer therapy. furthermore, ang was shown to have in vitro antimicrobial  <cit>  and antiviral  <cit>  effects, raising the possibility of its implication in the innate immune system. recently, ang mutations were described in amyotrophic lateral patients  <cit> , constituting the second angiogenic factor implicated in this disease  <cit> .

the human ang gene comprises a single exon flanked by small utrs and codes for a  <dig> kda polypeptide. the protein is synthesized with a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved to produce a mature form with  <dig> amino acids. sequence analysis revealed its homology to the ribonuclease a  superfamily, where it was included and classified as rnase  <dig>  <cit> . ang has three main distinctive features when compared to the family archetype bovine rnase a:  the characteristic ribonuclease activity towards poly-, di- and cyclic nucleotides is 104- <dig> lower and its enzymatic specificity is also different  <cit> ;  the region between residues 58– <dig> appears to constitute a 'cell-binding site', independent from the active site  <cit> , probably involved primarily in protein-protein interactions; and  the region 31– <dig> constitutes a nucleolar localization signal  <cit> . all of these features are essential to the angiogenic activity as shown by directed mutagenesis experiments  <cit> .

the rnase superfamily has a highly dynamic evolutionary history, in which ang occupies an important position. the fact that only ang/rnase 5-like ribonucleases are found in non-mammalian vertebrates has led to the hypothesis that the rnase ancestral was structurally similar to ang. this ancestral enzyme was most likely involved in host-pathogen interactions and did not possess an angiogenic activity  <cit> . a gene expansion occurred before the divergence between placental and marsupial mammals, followed by a process of differential gene duplication and retention between different orders of the placental mammals, which resulted in the present inter-species diversity of the rnase superfamily  <cit> .

diversifying  selection had a strong influence in the rnase a superfamily evolutionary pathway: eosinophil rnases, edn and ecp, are among the most rapidly evolving coding sequences in primates  <cit> , as are the paralogous rodent eosinophil associated ribonucleases   <cit> . ang genes suffered a rapid expansion in rodents  <cit>  –  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes in the mouse genome,  <dig> genes in the rat genome – as the result of positive selection and gene sorting. ang was also previously shown to be under the effect of diversifying selection in primates  <cit> . all primate species analyzed thus far possess a single gene for ang except for pygathrix nemaeus , in which the ang gene appears to have pseudogenized  <cit> .

in this work we assessed the impacts of positive selection on the primate ang gene using:  a gene level evaluation of the non-synonymous/synonymous ratio  and  a protein level evaluation of radical changes in amino acid properties. several sites under positive selection were detected in the different functional regions of ang and the effects in its structure and function have been analyzed.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses
neighbor-joining , maximum-likelihood  and bayesian  tree reconstructions of the primate ang coding sequences  presented similar overall topologies . ml and bay trees were topologically identical, the main difference relatively to the nj tree being the unresolved homo/pan/gorilla trichotomy and the positioning of miopithecus talapoin. overall, tree topologies were mostly coherent with the accepted phylogeny of primates. the small differences detected are not surprising since the gene tree does not necessarily reflect the species tree  <cit> .

positive selection analyses
we first analyzed primate ang genes for signatures of positive selection using paml  <cit> . this software uses a maximum-likelihood approach to determine the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio , also designated ka/ks or dn/ds, a widely used measure to detect departures from neutrality as indicators of selective pressures on protein coding genes. a ω >  <dig> indicates positive selection, whereas ω =  <dig> indicates neutrality and ω <  <dig> is indicative of negative selection. branch models, where ω is permitted to vary between lineages, were first tested. the simplest model , a very strict model allowing a single ω for all branches, obtained a ω =  <dig> , providing a good support for positive selection in the primate ang. two ω ratios models and a free ω ratios model where also tested  and lrts performed against adequate null models. several branches presented a ω ratio above one, but only the two-ratio model for the branch including papio hamadryas, macaca mulatta and cercopithecus aethiops  presented a significant lrt. we then tested three nested pairs of site models that allow ω variation between codons: one admitting no positive selection  and another admitting positive selection . both positive selection admitting models, m2a and m <dig>  presented a significantly better fit to the data than their neutral counterparts m1a, m <dig> and m8a . the slightly more conservative model m <dig> detected 41% of sites under positive selection , whereas m <dig> detected 49% of sites under positive selection , indicating with a high degree of confidence that the ang gene is under positive selection. these results were consistent across all the tree reconstruction methods used. posterior bayesian analysis through a bayes empirical bayes  methodology  <cit>  allowed the determination of several amino acid sites under positive selection. m <dig> detected four sites with ω >  <dig> having a posterior probability  above  <dig>  and four above  <dig> , while m <dig> detected nine sites above  <dig>  and seven above  <dig> . either of the models detected several other sites with a pp above  <dig> . similar results were obtained across all tree topologies, with the exception of site  <dig> that only had a strong support in the nj topology. since m2a is more conservative and m <dig> more prone to false positives  <cit> , we adopted an empiric threshold to consider candidate sites under positive selection: a pp above  <dig>  for m <dig> and simultaneously above  <dig>  for m <dig>  fifteen sites were above the defined threshold .

ω and bayesian  analysis posterior probabilities obtained with the nj topology are shown for sites with pp >  <dig>  in m <dig> that also have a pp >  <dig>  in m2a. treesaap analysis results present the total number of radical changes in amino acid properties and their assigned categories. type i sites are shown in bold. *site  <dig> had only strong support when using the nj topology.

some concerns have been raised over the reliability of particular sites inferred to be under positive selection using paml  <cit> . further support for the paml results was obtained using a complementary protein level approach implemented in treesaap  <cit> . this program performs ancestral sequence reconstruction to determine and categorize evolutionary changes in  <dig> amino acid properties. the number of radical changes per site was used as an indicator of positive selection. an empirical threshold of six properties with radical changes was adopted to further support previous candidate sites. most of the  <dig> paml sites had radical amino acid changes, which in five cases had a number of properties above the defined threshold  . site  <dig> had the highest number of properties under selection . in order to facilitate posterior analyses, a categorization was introduced: sites that were above the defined threshold in treesaap were designated as type i, whereas the remaining sites were designated as type ii.

in order to assess if the sites under selection were only variant in angiogenin or throughout the whole rnase a superfamily, the primate ang sequences were compared with a pool of  <dig> non-angiogenin rnase sequences using the consurf web server  <cit> . this software calculates evolutionary conservation scores  based on alignments and a reference structure  . the sites under positive selection in the primate sequences presented low conservation scores of  <dig>  except for site  <dig> that had a score of  <dig>  conservation scores for sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were below the confidence cut-off for consurf. when analyzed in the pool of rnase sequences, sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented a high conservation score of 7; whereas sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> had moderate conservation scores of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the remaining sites had lower scores. it is striking that eight of the  <dig> sites detected under selection in the primate ang gene, including three of the five type i sites, are highly or moderately conserved in the rnase a family. although this might result in part from the structural and functional divergence between the members of this family, it also indicates that these sites are not subject to random variation throughout the family as a result of structural and functional permissiveness on their locations.

structure-function analyses
to envisage possible structure-function implications of positive selected sites in the ang gene, the candidate sites were mapped on the ang x-ray structure . sites clustered in particular regions of the protein structure, a good indication of a non-random event. four of the five positive selection clusters were located within known ang functional regions: clusters  <dig> and  <dig> in the active site region, cluster  <dig> in the nuclear location signal and cluster  <dig> in the 'cell-binding' site. interestingly, positive selection appears to act in all ang's regions currently deemed essential for its angiogenic function. in order to obtain further insights into the structural variations of these regions, homology 3d-structure models were produced for all the ancestral and current ang sequences, using swiss-model/deep-view  <cit> .

the active site
rnase' a active sites can be divided in different subsites corresponding to the binding sites of the phosphate , base  and ribose  moieties of each rna nucleotide . the most important ones are subsites:  p <dig>  where scission of the p-o5' bond occurs;  b <dig>  where the 3' base binds and  b <dig> where interaction with the 5' base occurs. structural comparisons between rnase a and ang have allowed the mapping and characterization of the different catalytic subsites  <cit> . only the p <dig> subsite  appears to be well conserved, the most striking structural differences residing in the b <dig> subsite that appears to be blocked by gln <dig> and partly by phe <dig> 

as expected due to functional constraints, no evidence for positive selection was detected in amino acids with important roles to the p <dig>  b <dig> or b <dig> catalytic subsites. cluster- <dig> of positive selected sites under positive selection was located in the subsite p <dig> region, and included type i site,  <dig>  and three type ii sites:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these sites were all located within the first ang α-helix, neighboring several conserved important amino acids. site  <dig> presented the greatest diversity of drastic changes in chemical and structural properties, linked to polarity, hydrophobicity, bulkiness and structural conformation. a more reduced diversity was obtained for site  <dig> mostly reflecting chemical changes, whereas sites  <dig> and  <dig> had few and mostly conformational properties under positive selection.

interestingly, cluster- <dig> presented a proline in site  <dig> for two of the primate species analyzed, colobus guereza and macaca mulatta . this amino acid may cause the kinking of α-helices  thereby affecting the local structure of this region. to further evaluate the effects of these substitutions, we compared the 3d-structure models for these two species with the 3d-strucutre model inferred for the most recent common ancestral of these, superimposing the protein backbones . macaca mulatta ang presented a significant backbone distortion that was not so pronounced in colobus guereza ang. the overall structure of this region does not appear to be significantly affected, given the good positional overlap between the side chains of critical amino acids like neighboring arg <dig> and also phe <dig> and his <dig>  the location of site  <dig> at the beginning of the helix is perhaps allowing some distortion without significantly affecting the position of critical amino acids.

cluster- <dig> included four selected sites, type i sites  <dig>  and  <dig> , type ii sites  <dig>  and  <dig> , located close or within the anti-parallel β-sheet formed by β-strands b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  sites  <dig> and  <dig> lie at the c-terminal region of the active site, while sites  <dig> and  <dig> are located further up, facing the exterior of the protein. site  <dig>  neighboring two important active site residues lys <dig>  and ile <dig>  , presented a total of seven amino acid properties suffering drastic changes, namely properties pertaining polarity and size/molecular weight. as for site  <dig>  located close to another residue of the b <dig> subsite thr <dig>  four properties were detected concerning mostly the acid-base characteristics and the buriedness of the residue. the second site under positive selection in strand b <dig>  site  <dig>  presented a total of six properties under selection related with polarity, acid-base properties and conformational properties. finally, site  <dig>  had a total of five properties detected pertaining to acid-base, size and conformation-related characteristics.

•mutation to proline disrupts ribonucleolytic activity   <cit> .
•involved in the contacts of the complex ang-ri  <cit> .
•interacts with phe <dig> and shields met <dig> and cys <dig> from solvent  <cit> .
•involved in the contacts of the complex ang-ri  <cit> .
•conserved throughout angiogenins, considered essential for actin binding  <cit> .
sites under positive selection are indicated in the last column,  type i sites,  type ii sites.

overall, the results for the two clusters located in the active site region suggest that selective forces act in several of the more permissive sites of subsites p <dig> and b <dig>  shaping the local chemical and conformational environment without significantly interfering with the position critical residues, which are probably subject to purifying selection.

the nucleolar targeting sequence
the nucleolar import of ang was mapped in the position 31rrrgl <dig>  <cit> , a region encompassing the c-terminal region of helix h <dig> and the beginning of loop l <dig>  ang import was further shown to be independent of the classic nuclear localization signal-importin α/β pathway with a proposed mechanism involving import through passive diffusion and retention in the nucleus/nucleolus mediated by the nts region  <cit> .

cluster- <dig> of sites under positive selection is located in this region with a type i site  <dig>  and a type ii site  <dig> . analysis of drastic changes in amino acid properties for site  <dig> resulted in a total of five properties indicative of changes in polarity and helical conformation. site  <dig> had an elevated number of drastic changes in properties as a result of the broad diversity of amino acid substitutions . the chemical and structural divergence observed for these two sites will surely influence the interactions with other proteins mediated through this region. however, further clarification of the pathway for nuclear import or retention and the amino acid sites involved in both partners would be required in order to fully assess the impact and possible causes for positive selection in this region.

the cell-binding site
a putative 'cell-binding' site was first mapped to the region between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  as the proteolytic cleavage of peptide bonds 60/ <dig>  67/ <dig> or both, abolished the angiogenic activity without significantly affecting the enzymatic activity  <cit> . mutation of arg <dig>  <cit>  and the substitution of ang residues 58– <dig> for their rnase counterparts produced similar results. deamination experiments pointed out a second important residue, asn <dig>  and also a possible second region containing asn <dig>  <cit> . the 'cell-binding' site was implicated in the binding to α-actin  <cit> , in particular residues asn <dig> and gly <dig>  conserved in angiogenins  <cit> . however, the interacting region remains elusive in other identified interacting proteins as a putative  <dig> kda receptor  <cit>  or α-2-actinin  <cit> .

cluster- <dig> of sites under positive selection partly overlaps with the cell-binding site, including two type i sites:  <dig>  and arg <dig> and a type ii site: val <dig>  for the first of these sites, a total of nine properties were subjected to drastic changes: four chemical properties, four structural properties and one uncategorized property. these are mostly related to polarity and volume/spatial occupation. site  <dig> presented the highest number of properties subject to drastic changes in this analysis with a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> properties – nine chemical and seven structural. overall, the evolutionary changes observed for sites  <dig> and  <dig> influence the interactions performed by this region. however, further information about the interactions between this region of ang and other proteins would be required in order to further evaluate the effects of positive selection in this region.

site  <dig>  is a buried residue, but was also included in this cluster, since its α-carbon is relatively close to sites  <dig> and  <dig> . this site is part of the hydrophobic core of the enzyme  and only one structural property was detected. the observed amino acid changes  were replacements between branched-chain amino acids, conservative in terms of hydrophobicity.

clusters outside know functional regions
cluster- <dig> had two type ii sites,  <dig>  and  <dig> , located in helix  <dig> outside of the main functional regions. the support for site  <dig> as being under selection was weak, only obtained with the nj topology in paml. as for site  <dig> no particular functional or structural information was available, besides being a rather flexible residue  that is exposed to the solvent. it has a total of five properties with drastic changes, mostly concerning acid-base and conformational characteristics.

driving forces for diversifying selection
previous work by zhang and rosenberg  <cit>  had reported positive selection in the primate ang gene and analyzed its effects in terms of charge-altering substitutions. in this study we present a more extensive analysis at the gene and protein level and obtain evidence for positive selection in all the ang regions considered essential for angiogenesis, a good indication that this is the main underlying process for diversifying selection in this gene. however, it remains elusive on whether it is physiological or pathological angiogenesis that drives ang evolution.

two events are generally used as reference for physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis: placentation and cancer. all the primate groups analyzed in this study have hemochorial placentas, the most invasive form of placentation, where a direct contact between the placental and maternal circulations is established. expression studies are only available for human placentas and indicate significant increases in the ang levels in last trimester placentas, correlating well with the dramatic increase in placental vessel density and in fetal growth that occurs in this period  <cit> . further ang expression studies on other primate placentas, in particular those of lemurs and lorises that have non-invasive epithelichorial placentation could help to evaluate the existence of a connection between ang levels, placentation type and positive selection on this gene. even if such a connection is established, the apparent increasing gradient of placentation invasiveness over the primate phylogeny must be seen with caution, given that studies on mammalian placenta evolution  <cit>  have shown that the eurtherian ancestral already had a deeply invasive placenta and that the different forms of placentation currently observed were the result of clade-specific or convergent evolution.

as for cancer, the overexpression of ang has been documented in many tumors and appears to correlate well with disease establishment, progression and in some cases aggressiveness . many authors suggest that tumor cells might increase ang  expression to guarantee the blood supply of the growing tumor, however, there is little information on the genetic changes underlying this overexpression and mutations in the ang gene predisposing to cancer are unknown.

it is noteworthy that invasive placentation and cancer progression share many features, like the invasive cell phenotype, vessel reorganization and neovascularization at the site of implantation. therefore, any evolutionary changes that impact placentation are likely to have implications in cancer. previously, zhang and rosenberg  <cit>  suggested, based on the importance of ang in pregnancy to embryo vascularization, that diversifying selection could result from an evolutionary 'conflict of interests' between mothers and fetuses. the same authors also compared ang evolution to another cancer-related protein under positive selection brca <dig>  <cit> , and suggested that the selective pressures acting in these genes were more likely related with the physiological functions of their encoded proteins and not with cancer. the hypothesis of evolutionary conflict was recently analyzed by crespi and summers in relation to cancer  <cit> . these authors suggested that the particular incidence of positive selection in cancer-related genes is motivated by the strong ongoing selection generated by evolutionary conflict . this hypothesis is based on the fact that the physiological processes that involve antagonistic coevolution, like resource acquisition and use, cellular replication and tissue growth are also critical to cancer predisposition. the strong selection due to antagonistic coevolution would drive the changes in conflict-related genes, and the pleiotropic effects of these changes would increase cancer risk.

the association between ang mutations and disease has only recently been observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  patients  <cit> , mostly from irish and scottish descent. seven different mutations where described in  <dig> individuals with both sporadic and familial forms of the disease. these affected mostly conserved amino acids of functional or structural importance like arg31lys, cys39trp  or catalytic lys40ile , that should result in moderate or severe impairment of ang function and therefore did not coincide with any of the sites found to be under positive selection. the implication of ang in this disease is still obscure, given that these mutations are rare, inexistent in other populations  <cit>  and, in fact, a moderate increase in ang expression has been documented in als patients  <cit> .

although angiogenesis appears to take centre stage as a driving force for positive selection in the ang gene, it is still possible that there are other processes contributing to selective pressures. several lines of evidence have accumulated supporting the existence of other ang functions:  the expression of ang mrna is low in the developing fetus, reaching maximum levels in the adult, a pattern not temporarily related to vessel development  <cit>  and has a widespread pattern of expression in many human cell types  <cit> ;  ang is a component of normal serum that is upregulated in acute phase responses, suggesting an involvement in host injury response  <cit> ;  human ang antimicrobial activity was also demonstrated in vitro  <cit> , but it is still elusive whether this is a result of the ribonucleolytic activity or some other effect. the possible ang involvement in injury response and innate immunity constitutes another intriguing hypothesis for a selection driving force. the constant "arms-race" between host and pathogens is a well known for maintaining a strong selective pressure in immunity-related genes. a similar possibility was raised in the mouse  <cit> , whose six paralogous ang genes were shown to be under positive selection, two of which presenting an antimicrobial activity . the role of ang <dig> in gut innate immunity was characterized in vivo  <cit> . further characterization of human/primate ang anti-microbial effects is required in order to assess this hypothesis. nonetheless, this is yet another possibility that is compatible with the theory of evolutionary conflict.

finally, it is also important to consider the role that interacting proteins and ligands may have in the evolution of ang. we evaluated the solvent exposure of the residues detected to be under positive selection by analyzing the accessible surface area  using getarea . this program estimates if a residue is exposed at the surface or buried in the protein, based on the ratio between side-chain asa and the "random coil" values per residue. eleven of the fifteen sites presented an asa ratio equal or above 50% , three above 40%  and only one bellow 20% . the majority of the sites is therefore exposed to the exterior of the protein and can a priori modulate the interactions with other proteins or ligands. it is also noteworthy that some of the sites detected under positive selection in this study were found to be involved in contacts with the ribonuclease inhibitor  in the crystal structure of the ang-ri complex . furthermore, ang has been shown to stimulate rrna production  <cit> , possibly mediated by binding to a specific rdna non-transcribed sequence  <cit> . more precise structural characterizations of the interactions performed by ang and its partners are still lacking and will be essential to further assess which are the critical amino acids and regions of the protein.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we aimed at evaluating in detail the amino acid sites under positive selection in the primate ang gene, including its possible structural and functional impacts. using a maximum-likelihood gene level analysis we obtained evidence for positive selection on the ang gene. posterior site specific analyses allowed the identification of  <dig> sites with strong evidence of positive selection, further corroborated by a protein level analysis that showed that five of these sites also had an elevated number of amino acid properties suffering radical changes. the mapping of these sites in the ang 3d-structure revealed five clusters in specific regions within the main functional regions of the protein. in the active site region, positive selection appears to modulate the chemical and structural characteristics of a few permissive sites without affecting the position of the critical residues. significant chemical and structural divergence is further observed in two other regions, the nucleolar location signal and 'cell-binding' site, clearly having a potential to influence the interactions performed through them.

given that evidence of positive selection was detected in all ang functional regions required for angiogenesis, it is tempting to indicate angiogenesis as the process underlying selection. it is unclear, however, if it is physiologic or pathologic involvement of ang in angiogenesis that dictates the selective pressures. the two prototypical situations, placentation and cancer, share common features in the primate species analyzed and the hypothesis of selective pressures motivated by antagonistic coevolution appears to set a common ground explanation on how the evolutionary changes motivated by physiologic processes involving ang can lead to an increased risk of cancer. however, other processes may also influence ang's adaptative evolution, and the possible involvement in innate immunity is particularly interesting since the host-pathogen 'arms-race' is a common origin for selective pressure. also, one must consider the possibility of ang/ligands co-evolution given that most sites under selection are exposed in the surface of the protein and can mediate interactions. future experimental characterizations of ang function, physiologic mechanism and interactions will allow further evaluation of these hypotheses.
