BACKGROUND
the discovery of three verrucomicrobial methanotrophs that constitute the methylacidiphilum genus  and characterization of their ecological, physiological, and phylogenetic properties have shed light on the diversity of processes through which aerobic methanotrophs use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy  <cit> . a remarkable characteristic of these bacteria is their ability to oxidize methane in extreme and hostile conditions of volcanic and geothermal areas. three methylacidiphilum strains  were isolated from acidic volcanic areas in italy, russia, and new zealand, respectively . the draft genome assembly of m. fumariolicum solv and the complete genome sequence of m. infernorum v <dig> have previously been published  <cit> , showing over 98% sequence identity for their 16s rrna genes  <cit> . likewise, phylogenetic analysis of the pmoa genes, encoding the 24 kda β-subunit of particulate methane mono-oxygenase , revealed a strong similarity of these strains and their separation from other methanotrophs  <cit> . in addition, major differences in c <dig> utilization pathways were found between these strains and other proteobacterial and nc <dig> methanotrophs  <cit> . a comprehensive understanding of how these bacteria have evolved and thrive in such hostile environmental conditions partially relies on deciphering their genetic diversity and architecture.

the draft genome of m. fumariolicum solv was previously constructed using illumina gaii and roche  <dig> reads  <cit> . despite the high coverage of illumina gaii and roche  <dig> sequencing reads as well as improvement of the assembly by manual curation of the assembly graph, the genome of m. fumariolicum solv remained fragmented . the short lengths of illumina gaii and roche  <dig> sequencing reads can prevent the assembler from resolving repeats, which leaves the assembly incomplete. furthermore, regions with high or low gc content are difficult to pcr and thus to sequence using second-generation sequencing platforms. here, we report the complete genome sequence of the m. fumariolicum solv that was determined by pacific biosciences single-molecule real-time  sequencing technology. using smrt sequencing, long and highly accurate single-molecule sequencing reads were generated to resolve long repeats that remained in the unfinished and fragmented draft genome. these reads can resolve regions with extreme gc content, palindromic sequences, and other sequence contexts that challenge other sequencing platforms. following the completion of the genome and the annotation of genes and functional subsystems, we characterize the phylogenetic relationship between the genome of m. fumariolicum solv and that of other methanotrophs, particularly the m. infernorum v <dig>  in order to assess the accuracy of the single chromosome assembly, two independent smrt sequencing runs were generated and aligned to determine the consensus accuracy. next, we performed genome-wide expression analysis to understand how major pathways are regulated in m. fumariolicum solv cell cultures grown under different conditions. bacterial dna methylation is believed to play a role in maintaining genome integrity, gene regulation, and as a defence mechanism to identify and destroy foreign dna that is differentially methylated . so far, the global methylation state of bacterial kingdom is poorly understood  <cit> , owing to the complexity and laborious nature of experiments that are needed for such studies. in the advent of smrt sequencing technology, polymerase kinetics during sequencing can be used to identify n6-methladenine , 4-methylcytosine , and 5-methylcytosine  at a base-pair resolution  <cit> . since m. fumariolicum solv genome contains copies of methyltransferases, we extend the analysis to epigenetic characterization of m. fumariolicum solv by providing a global methylation state of the genome and the associated motifs. finally, we explore the occurrence of methylation within the coding sequences that can affect the regulation of genes.

RESULTS
genome assembly and annotation
to obtain the complete genome sequence of m. fumariolicum solv, eight smrt sequencing runs were performed that yielded  <dig>  long  and high-quality single-molecule sequencing reads . despite the high coverage of the single-molecule sequencing reads, the presence of randomly distributed sequencing errors prevents de novo assembly on filtered subreads. a number of strategies have been proposed to correct single-molecule sequencing reads . in order to avoid introducing inherent biases of second-generation sequencing technologies and to take full advantage of single-molecule sequencing reads, we have used hierarchical genome-assembly process  to correct sequencing errors in filtered subreads. hgap  <cit>  relies on shorter single-molecule sequencing reads to construct highly accurate preassemblies on single-molecule sequencing reads that are longer than the seed length. the hgap pipeline, using a seed length of  <dig>  bp, resulted in  <dig>  corrected reads that ranged between 501 bp and  <dig>  bp in length and had an average gc content of  <dig> % . despite the significant loss of sequencing depth during the correction procedure , sufficient coverage depth  remained to perform a de novo assembly using the overlap-layout-consensus  strategy.table  <dig>

celera assembler  <dig>  was used to assemble the corrected single-molecule sequencing reads into a single contig. the complete genome sequence of m. fumariolicum solv is  <dig> , <dig> base pairs in length with an average gc content of  <dig> % . compared to the draft genome sequence  <cit> , the final assembly contains  <dig>  more bases and has a  <dig> % higher gc content. we identified four misassembled contigs in the draft genome that could be split and mapped to different genomic locations . misassemblies were the result of the presence of repeats, small close-range duplications, and lower coverage. in addition, we identified caht <dig>  as the only contig that could not be mapped  to the final assembly. the presence of this sequence in the genome of m. fumariolicum solv could not be supported by the alignment of long reads to the draft genome. the only strong blast hit for the caht <dig>  sequence  was to the mitochondrial genome of cygnus columbianus . the total of  <dig> gaps in the draft genome summed to a total of  <dig>  bp. although, on average, these sequence gaps were rather short , they had a very high gc content of  <dig> % compared to that of the entire genome . the  <dig> % increase in gc content is in concordance with known limitation of second generation sequencing technologies in sequencing genomic regions with extreme gc contents.table  <dig>

the accuracy of the final assembly was assessed after aligning single-molecule sequencing reads that were generated from two independent smrt sequencing runs. we observed a consensus accuracy of  <dig> % between reads and the reference sequence, with no significant coverage fluctuation over the entire genome. moreover,  <dig> % of illumina gaii and roche  <dig> reads  that were used to assemble the draft genome  <cit>  mapped to the complete genome sequence . however, we observed significant fluctuations in illumina gaii coverage that often coincides with gaps in the draft genome and the presence of repeats. we found  <dig> repeats across the genome, including  <dig> short tandem repeats . we observed a high gc content  across larger repeats , whereas tandem repeats had a low gc content of  <dig> % . this is not the case for the genome of m. infernorum v <dig> as only a few short tandem and larger repeats were found . the co-occurrence of repeats and low depth of coverage can significantly hamper the assembly and may explain the fragmentation of the draft genome.

after annotating the complete genome sequence using rast  <cit> , we identified  <dig>  protein-encoding genes and  <dig> rnas, from which  <dig>  were allocated to  <dig> annotated subsystems, biological processes or structural complexes that are realised by a set of functional roles  <cit> . the origin of replication was identified by gc skew analysis  <cit>  and mapped to approximately  <dig>  nucleotides upstream of the dnaa gene that is located at 326002– <dig> genomic coordinates. the terminus of dna replication is approximately located at  <dig> , <dig> genomic position. the complete genome annotation contains  <dig> newly discovered genes, from which  <dig> were found in gaps in the draft genome. only  <dig> % of genes that are fully or partially located in gaps had known function whereas the remaining genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins . we also identified two newly annotated genes  that belong to the c-subunit of pmmo that were absent in the draft assembly. furthermore, the annotations of genes that belong to key metabolic pathways were manually curated based on comparison to public databases .

phylogenetic and comparative genome analysis
except for the facultative methanotroph methylocella tundrae
 <cit>  and the obligate methanotroph methyloferula stellata
 <cit> , all aerobic methanotrophs known so far contain a membrane-bound particulate methane mono-oxygenase . therefore, the pmoa gene  has been widely used as a marker to determine the phylogeny of methanotrophic bacteria, which is largely comparable to that of the 16s rrna-based phylogeny . the phylogenetic relationship between annotated pmoa proteins indicates a strong separation of the genus methylacidiphilum  from other methanotrophs . the pmoa <dig> gene shows a very distinctive branch in the phylogenetic tree whereas pmoa <dig> and pmoa <dig> genes are clustered together as a separate methylacidiphilum branch deep in the main cluster. these observations are in concordance with phylogenetic relationships that were previously reported for pmoa proteins  <cit> .

since m. infernorum v <dig> is the closest relative for which the complete genome sequence is known  <cit> , we compared the genome of m. fumariolicum solv to this strain. the analysis highlights a number of inversions and transpositions between two genomes . amino acid comparison of protein-encoding genes  revealed that  <dig> % of pegs are present in the genome of m. infernorum v <dig> with more than 80% identity, whereas  <dig> % were exclusive to m. fumariolicum solv . notably,  <dig> % of pegs have at least 50% identity to the genome of m. infernorum v <dig> . shared pegs are distributed across the entire genome. in addition, we did not find a significant enrichment of pegs that are exclusive to either genome in a specific metabolic pathway .

transcriptome analysis
cells cultured under three different conditions  were previously used to sequence mrnas in three independent rna sequencing  experiments  <cit> . the gene expression analysis was previously performed on the draft genome of m. fumariolicum solv  <cit> . here, we extend this analysis using the complete sequence and annotation of this genome.  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> single-end sequencing reads were generated for these cell cultures, respectively. subsequently, reads were mapped to the complete genome of m. fumariolicum solv and filtered for those that mapped to the ribosomal rna operon. over  <dig> % of sequencing reads mapped to the reference sequence with concordance to the genome annotation. next, rna-seq data from cell cultures under nitrogen fixing  and oxygen limited  conditions were compared to rna-seq data from cell cultures growing at μmax . in n2fix and o2lim cultures,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genes were differentially expressed with  <dig> genes present in both conditions . from  <dig> newly annotated genes,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed in n2fix and o2lim cell cultures, respectively. since the majority of these genes are not attributed to specific subsystems, we could not assess the enrichment of key pathways in this set.figure  <dig>

the majority of differentially expressed genes showed a relatively lower level of expression in n2fix and o2lim cell cultures compared to μmax . the expression levels  and associated statistics are provided for the curated list of genes that are present in nine key pathways . despite a substantial down-regulation of genes in n2fix cell cultures,  <dig> % of genes that are involved in nitrogen fixation were significantly upregulated . this observation is in agreement with our previous physiological studies that indicate the presence of active nitrogenase in these cultures  <cit> . we did not observe a significant up-regulation of this pathway in o2lim cell cultures . moreover, genes involved in two out of three pmocab operons that encode for three subunits of pmmo were differentially expressed in n2fix and o2lim cell cultures . in both cultures, genes in pmocab <dig> operon showed a significantly higher expression levels whereas those involved in pmocab <dig> showed a strong decline in their expression as compared to μmax cell cultures . the expression of genes involved in tricarboxylic acid  cycle, carbon energy storage, carbon fixation, glycogen metabolism, and calvin benson bassham  cycle pathways were either unchanged or showed a significant decline in n2fix and o2lim cell cultures as compared to μmax cell cultures .

base modifications and associated motifs
smrt sequencing provides a unique platform for detecting n6-methyladenine , 4-methylcytosine , and 5-methylcytosine  bases across the genome  <cit> . the m. fumariolicum solv genome contains multiple methyltransferases  and it should therefore be possible to detect different types of methylation. we have identified  <dig> different methyltransferases of which  <dig> could also be found in m. infernorum v <dig> with an average  <dig> % identity . in addition, we could also find  <dig> rna-methyltransferases, all of which were also present in m. infernorum v <dig> . in order to assess the genome-wide methylation profile of m. fumariolicum solv and identify the associated motifs, we performed two smrt sequencing runs on an independently isolated and prepared sequencing library. to obtain a reliable polymerase kinetic signal for 5mc, the dna was treated with tet <dig> oxidation before sequencing  <cit> . this resulted in ~ <dig>  single-molecule sequencing reads  with an average quality of  <dig>   that yield to  <dig> × average coverage of the reference genome. sequencing reads were distributed normally across the genome with no missing bases and a consensus accuracy of  <dig> % . genome-wide analysis of polymerase kinetic profiles during smrt sequencing enabled the identification of methylated adenine and cytosine bases. adenine bases showed a very strong modification signal that strongly correlated with depth of coverage on each strand . based on the distribution of modification quality values , a threshold for modification qv was increased to  <dig> to limit the amount of false positive modification calls . we identified  <dig>  6mas,  <dig> 4mcs, and  <dig> 5mcs that were distributed across the entire genome . whereas no motif was associated with cytosine methylation, sequence context analysis of methylated adenines indicated that  <dig>  of methylated adenines  were associated with three putative adenine methyltransferase recognition motifs: 5′-6macn4gt-3′ , 5′-cc6man5ctc-3′ , and 5′-g6magn5tgg-3′  motifs . 5′-cc6man5ctc-3′ and 5′-g6magn5tgg-3′ are partner motifs as they are reverse complement of each other. adenine methylation was observed for over 98% of associated motifs in the genome . overall,  <dig> % of methylated adenines and  <dig> % of cytosine methylations reside in coding regions of the m. fumariolicum solv genome.figure  <dig>

discussion
it is essential to decipher a complete genetic makeup of methylacidiphilum fumariolicum solv to fully understand the underlying mechanisms used to oxidize methane in the hostile environmental conditions of volcanic and geothermal areas  <cit> . although the high-quality draft genome of m. fumariolicum solv was previously published  <cit> , efforts in finishing the genome remained unsuccessful due to the inherent limitations of second-generation sequencing technologies in resolving repeats and regions with extreme gc content. here, we present the complete reference sequence of the m. fumariolicum solv genome obtained using the single-molecule real-time  sequencing strategy. smrt sequencing of two large-insert template libraries followed by correction of sequencing errors resulted in high-quality de novo assembly of a single chromosome that is  <dig>  mbp in size, with a gc content of  <dig> %. due to the presence of long repeats and extremely low sequencing depth of illumina gaii in gc-rich regions, this could not be achieved by combining short second-generation sequencing reads and long reads generated by smrt sequencing  <cit> . the de novo assembled complete genome of m. fumariolicum solv has a very high quality as it holds a consensus accuracy of  <dig> % with single-molecule reads that were generated in two independent smrt sequencing runs. we identified a number of misassemblies in the draft genome that were mainly the result of repeats and large fluctuation in illumina gaii coverage. despite recent advancements in chemistry and library preparation protocols of second-generation sequencing platforms, achieving a sufficient and uniform coverage on genomic regions with extreme gc content is challenging  <cit> .

genome annotation revealed the presence of  <dig>  protein-encoding genes,  <dig> rnas, and  <dig> functional subsystems. moreover, the annotation of the complete genome sequence enabled the discovery of  <dig> genes that were previously missed in the draft genome. closer analysis of newly annotated genes revealed the presence of two genes that belong to the c-subunit of pmmo. these genes were missed in the draft assembly. for new genes that fall in gaps or misassembled regions of the draft genome, only a minor fraction  could be associated with functional subsystems. other major pathways that could be associated with multiple genes were ton and tol transport systems and ribonucleotide reduction. after manually curating key metabolic pathways, a full calvin-benson-bassham cycle was identified for carbon fixation whereas both the ribulose monophosphate and serine cycle pathways were absent. this is in concordance with our previous physiological studies  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of pmoa genes confirmed the separation of three species within the genus of methylacidiphilum from other known methanotrophs. moreover,  <dig> % of annotated genes were highly conserved  between m. fumariolicum solv and m. infernorum v <dig>  whereas almost a third remained exclusive to the genome of m. fumariolicum solv. the genome-wide analysis of expression profiles revealed a substantial down-regulation of genes in cell cultures with nitrogen fixation  or oxygen limitation  growth conditions. except for genes that were originally missed or misassembled in the draft genome, our results are in full concordance to our previous transcriptome analysis  <cit>  that was performed on the draft genome. the expression of genes involved in tca cycle, carbon energy storage, carbon fixation, glycogen metabolism, and cbb cycle pathways were either unchanged or declined. the prominent down-regulation of genes is expected as less energy production is needed for these cell cultures given that they have been cultured at  reduced growth rates compared to μmax cells. furthermore, oxygen concentration may play a role in regulating pmocab operons as the expression of the pmocab <dig> and pmocab <dig> genes were significantly different in n2fix and o2lim cell cultures. it has also been shown that pmmo is differentially expressed under different growth conditions in m. kamchatkense
 <cit> . the genome of species in the methylacidiphilum genus includes all necessary genes to fix nitrogen  <cit> . in the absence of ammonium and nitrate, genes that are involved in nitrogen fixation were significantly upregulated, which is in concordance with physiological studies that indicate the presence of active nitrogenase in n2fix cell cultures  <cit> . these observations are in agreement with the result of our previous transcriptome analysis that was performed on the draft genome  <cit> .

dna methylation is involved in a variety of biological processes and can have a profound physiological and functional consequence  <cit> . despite its importance, the global dna methylation state for most of the bacterial kingdom is poorly understood. the genome of m. fumariolicum solv consist of several methyltransferases, including three polypeptides of type i restriction-modification  system. the absence of these genes in the genome of m. infernorum v <dig> suggests that methylation process can be regulated differently between species in the methylacidiphilum genus. comparative analysis of methylation patterns between these bacteria can be performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which the genome integrity, gene regulation and defence processes are maintained given that such data is available in the future. here, we characterize the methylation state of the m. fumariolicum solv genome at a base-pair resolution by performing two smrt sequencing runs on a single, tet <dig> treated library. the result indicates a genome-wide adenine methylation that is associated with 5′-m6acn4gt-3′, 5′-ccm6an5ctc-3′, and 5′-gm6agn5tgg-3′ motifs. of  <dig>  motif sites in the genome, only  <dig> sites were considered unmethylated under our growth condition. although we were able to identify  <dig> 4mcs and  <dig> 5mcs, cytosine methylations were not associated with any specific motifs. to our knowledge, both 6ma motifs are potentially novel. it is possible that m. fumariolicum solv contains genomic regions that are actively evolved against any occurrence of the 5′-ccm6an5ctc-3′ system as there are several regions without any methylation of this kind. mobile elements can, in principle, contribute to avoiding the rm systems. however, our analysis rules out their involvement since none were identified in the m. fumariolicum solv genome . further studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the negative selection of this methylation motif in this bacterium. in addition, it is essential to investigate the global influence of identified methylation motifs on gene expression that can be differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle and their affect on the physiology and function of this bacterium. this study provides a comprehensive atlas of m. fumariolicum solv genome that allows for further transcriptome and epigenetic analysis of cell cultures under different growth conditions and stage of cell cycle to unravel the mechanisms through which methane oxidation is regulated in harsh fumarolic conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we reveal the complete genome sequence of methylacidiphilum fumariolicum strain solv and performed a thorough analysis of its genetic makeup, using a single-molecule real-time sequencing strategy. the finished sequence of a single chromosome enabled us to provide insights on genes that were missed due to gaps in the draft genome that were mainly caused by the limitations of second-generation sequencing technologies, owing to repetitiveness and high gc content of these regions. in addition, the complete genome sequence allowed us to expose misassemblies and perform a comparative analysis between genomes of the m. fumariolicum solv and m. infernorum v <dig>  for the first time, we provide a high-resolution and global methylation state of a methylacidiphilum bacterium and the associated motifs at a base-pair resolution. unravelling the m. fumariolicum solv genome and its epigenetic regulation allow for robust characterization of biological processes that are involved in oxidizing methane. in turn, they offer a better understanding of the evolution, the underlying physiological and ecological properties of solv and other methylacidiphilum strains.
