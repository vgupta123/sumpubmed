BACKGROUND
one of the basic experiments in cell biology is to remove a specific protein, conduct a phenotypic analysis and from that deduce the function of the protein. often, the main problem is to remove the protein of interest quickly and efficiently. many techniques have been developed to disturb the synthesis, activity or abundance of a selected protein  <cit> . the addition of a destabilizing sequence  is used to reduce the half-life of the target protein by inducing proteasomal proteolysis  <cit> . a recent development to target proteins for degradation is the auxin-inducible degron, a relative of the protacs system. both methods use chemical compounds to tether a protein to an ubiquitin-protein-ligase, thereby inducing polyubiquitylation and degradation of the target protein  <cit> . other methods utilize small chemical compounds to change the destabilization activity of protein domains  <cit> , or degrade target proteins employing the bacterial protease clpxp  <cit> .

one very widespread method is the release of an n-degron by proteolysis applying the ubiquitin-fusion technique. the fusion of ubiquitin to the n-terminus of a protein results in cleavage by deubiquitylating enzymes between ubiquitin and the protein. thereby, almost all amino acids can be exposed at the n-terminus of a protein. the technique led to the formulation of the n-end rule, which states that the in vivo half-life of a protein is related to the identity of the n-terminal amino acid  <cit> . in yeast  <dig> amino acids  destabilize a protein if exposed at the n-terminus. eight of these destabilizing amino acids are directly recognized by the ubiquitin-protein-ligase ubr <dig> , whereas four have to be modified by deamidation and/or arginylation  before. recognition by ubr <dig> leads to polyubiquitylation of the protein followed by proteasomal proteolysis  <cit> . varshavsky and his co-workers developed a temperature-sensitive degron for the creation of conditional mutants  <cit> . this technique has been used effectively to investigate functions of many essential proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae, although it is often necessary to use high level expression of ubr <dig> to induce a temperature-sensitive phenotype  <cit> .

recently, the tobacco etch virus  protease induced protein instability  system was developed as another tool to create conditional mutants. a degradation tag  with a dormant n-degron is fused to the n-terminus of a target protein. presence of the tev protease leads to site-specific proteolysis of the tag and exposure of the n-degron. this initiates destabilization of the target protein. fast and efficient cleavage of the substrate is achieved utilizing a tev protease  with enhanced processivity towards the tdegf tag. thus, by regulation of ptev+ protease expression the tipi system allows to control target protein abundance  <cit> .

one of the well studied degrons, which might be useful for protein depletion, is the c-terminal degron of the mouse ornithine decarboxylase  which is conserved in vertebrates  <cit> . it induces rapid, proteasomal proteolysis independent of polyubiquitylation  <cit> . the half-life of full-length mouse ornithine decarboxylase expressed in yeast has been found to be  <dig> minutes  <cit> . two elements within the degron mediate the destabilization activity. the first is a cysteine-alanine motif, which is important for proteasomal association. the second consists of an unstructured region flanking the cysteine-alanine motif, comprising  <dig> amino acids upstream and  <dig> downstream  <cit> . the codc degron destabilizes a protein only if present at the very c-terminus  <cit> . moving the cysteine-alanine motif only a few amino acids closer to the c-terminus or farther away impairs the destabilizing activity  <cit> . the codc degron has been used to destabilize proteins in the fungus saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , the plant nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi  <cit> , mammalian cell culture  <cit>  or to study protein degradation in vivo and in vitro  <cit> , though no conditional version of the degron has been developed. we reasoned that it should be possible to create a conditional c-degron by constructing a tag with the codc degron kept inactive due to a protective peptide added c-terminally to the codc degron. activation of the tag is achieved by site-specific proteolysis resulting in activation of the cryptic c-degron. we chose a dormant n-degron  <cit>  as protective group. thus, we created a bidirectional degron consisting of two degrons, which inactivate each other until tev protease cleavage. this bidirectional degron can be fused to the target n-terminally, c-terminally or placed internally to regulate protein abundance in vivo.

RESULTS
construction of conditional c-degrons
the structure of the bidirectional degrons is shown in figure 1a. we chose the tobacco etch virus  protease to activate the c-degrons due to our previous experience with the development of the tev protease induced protein instability  system  <cit> . the degrons are based on the conditional n-degron tdegf, which consists of an unstructured spacer region, the tev protease cleavage site enlyfq-f, an n-degron and an affinity domain derived from the human protein sf3b <dig> . this affinity domain binds strongly to the human protein p <dig>  which is fused to the tev protease, thereby enhancing processivity of the protease towards the tdegf tag  <cit> . the bidirectional degrons were created by insertion of sequences containing the cysteine-alanine motif and surrounding amino acids  of the c-terminal mouse ornithine decarboxylase degron  into the unstructured spacer region in front of the tev protease recognition site. in both constructs, the cysteine-alanine motif was placed  <dig> amino acids upstream of the cleavage site. thus, the newly developed bidirectional degrons consist of a c-degron separated from an n-degron by the tev protease recognition site . due to this arrangement, both degrons are kept inactive until the tag is cleaved by the tev protease. the usage of the bidirectional degron for conditional destabilization of target proteins is illustrated in figure 1b: the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp tag is fused to the 3'- end of the target gene. expression of the ptev+ protease gene is controlled by an appropriate promoter . upon expression of the ptev+ protease, the tag is cleaved at the consensus site  if it is exposed to the cytoplasm or the nucleus. this cleavage leads to activation of the two dormant degrons resulting in rapid proteasomal proteolysis of the target protein and the rfp. the sequences of the n-degron tdegf as well as the bidirectional degrons codc1-tdegf and codc2-tdegf are given in figure 1c.

due to the modular design of our constructs, the tev protease cleavage site might be flanked by stabilizing or destabilizing sequences. depending on the modules used, internal tagging of a two domain protein followed by in vivo proteolytic cleavage leads to destabilization of the whole protein, destabilization of one domain or separation of the domains . using this strategy, the tipi system is expanded not only by a c-degron, but gains the possibility to control the fate of protein domains after separation. the features of the newly developed constructs are summarized in table  <dig> 

the sequence of tdegm is similar to tdegf with the exception of the tev protease cleavage site . the sequences for codc1-tdegf and codc2-tdegf differ in the length of the codc sequence inserted into tdegf . the ability to act as an n-degron, a c-degron or a bidirectional degron is indicated for all constructs .

rapid protein depletion induced by the codc degron
we fused two different bidirectional degrons  between the green fluorescent protein  and the red fluorescent protein mkate  to obtain tester proteins. the behavior of the tester proteins was assessed upon ptev+ protease  <cit>  expression. we observed complete cleavage of the tester proteins, depletion of the f-rfp as well as codc-dependent destabilization of the gfp. interestingly, we observed complete disappearance of the gfp signal only in case of the codc <dig> construct , showing that codc <dig> mediates stronger destabilizing activity than codc <dig> 

for further characterization of the newly created c-degrons, we fused gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and gfp-codc2-tdegf-rfp to the c-terminus of cap <dig>  both constructs localized to patches near the plasma membrane, mostly within the bud. this localization pattern was found for cap2-gfp as well  <cit> , showing that addition of the tags did not influence subcellular localization. we followed the gfp- and rfp- fluorescence by live-cell imaging in presence and absence of the ptev+ protease. both, gfp- and rfp-fluorescence decreased in presence of the protease, almost complete loss of green fluorescence was observed in cells containing cap2-gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp . this demonstrates that membrane association of target proteins does not hamper proteolytic cleavage and depletion. a similar behavior has been found for substrates modified with the tdegf tag as well  <cit> . the codc1-tdegf tag was constructed as a conditional degron. to clarify, whether the codc sequences exert destabilizing activity on a protein without ptev+ protease cleavage, we assessed the stability of the tester proteins gfp-tdegf-rfp, gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp, gfp-codc2-tdegf-rfp and gfp-codc1-tdegf  after inhibition of protein synthesis. to do so, the cells were treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide at the same time as production of the ptev+ protease was induced. as expected, the tester proteins were not processed due to absence of the protease. we observed no degradation of the tester proteins gfp-tdegf-rfp, gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp, and gfp-codc2-tdegf-rfp, showing that the codc sequences we used do not destabilize these constructs without activation of the degradation tag. however, no signal of the gfp-codc1-tdegf construct was detected after cycloheximide treatment. moreover, the steady-state level of this protein was reduced compared to the other constructs . this indicates that the construct is destabilized without tev protease cleavage. presumably, this destabilization is induced by the largely unstructured sf3b155381-424-domain  <cit> . it is known that an unstructured domain serves as a weak signal for proteolysis by the ubiquitin proteasome system  <cit> . although the sf3b155381-424-domain is present in all our tester proteins, destabilization occurs only in case of the gfp-codc1-tdegf construct, which lacks a folded domain at the c-terminus of the protein.

mouse odc is degraded by the proteasome independently of the ubiquitin system  <cit> . therefore, reduced proteasomal activity should lead to incomplete proteolysis of a codc1-containing tester construct. using the cyan fluorescent protein  containing tester construct cfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp, we observed that ptev+ protease expression led to accumulation of cleavage intermediates in pre1- <dig> pre2- <dig> or pre1- <dig> pre4- <dig> mutant cells  <cit>  indicating incomplete proteolysis of cfp-codc1-tdeg and f-rfp fragments . proteasomal degradation of mouse odc depends on the cysteine-alanine motif, which is necessary for proteasomal association of the degron  <cit> . mutation of this motif should abolish rapid depletion of cleaved gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp. we replaced the cysteine by an alanine and compared the behavior of this construct with gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp. as expected, we found complete depletion of gfp-codc1-tdeg after ptev+ protease cleavage, whereas gfp-codc1c243a-tdeg was much less prone to degradation . the dependency on proteasomal activity and on the cysteine-alanine motif demonstrates that the codc <dig> degron induces proteolysis by the proteasome. in addition, we performed flow cytometry measurements of cells expressing tester constructs . these experiments confirmed our results obtained by immunoblotting .

next, we compared the destabilizing activity of the active codc <dig> degron to that of the n-degron tdegf. we performed fluorescence microscopy to visualize the gfp and rfp fluorescence of the constructs gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and gfp-tdegf-rfp after ptev+ protease cleavage. only cells containing the codc <dig> construct showed rapid loss of gfp fluorescence, whereas rfp fluorescence decreased in both cases . quantification of the images revealed that gfp-codc1-tdeg was depleted as quickly as f-rfp . our experiments with diverse tester proteins demonstrate that the bidirectional degron codc1-tdegf induces rapid target protein depletion after tev protease cleavage regardless if placed at the n- or c-terminus or inside the protein.

as shown in figure 1d, the tipi system is not restricted to complete destabilization of proteins. constructs containing codc1-tdegm and tdegm could be used to degrade only a single domain and to separate two domains without destabilization, respectively. as expected, proteolytic cleavage of gfp-codc1-tdegm-rfp resulted in destabilized gfp-codc1-tdeg and stable m-rfp whereas gfp-tdegm-rfp was split in two stable fluorescent proteins .

in summary, our results demonstrate that it is possible to create quasi artificial, conditional degrons with distinct properties based on the features of the codc degron. the newly developed codc degrons induce rapid degradation and their destabilizing activities depend solely on proteolytic cleavage of the bidirectional degron by the ptev+ protease. the less destabilizing codc2-tdegf tag might be useful to reduce target protein levels without complete depletion. weak degrons have been used before to measure transcription  <cit>  or proteasomal activity  <cit> . the data obtained with combinations of stabilizing sequences, n- or c-degrons  show that the tipi system provides a toolbox to control the fate of single domains in vivo.

creation of conditional mutants
we assessed, whether activation of the bidirectional degron induces depletion of target proteins to levels, at which specific phenotypes become observable. therefore, we inserted the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp tag and the gfp-codc1-tdegf tag chromosomally at the 3' end of the essential genes cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cyr <dig>  kog <dig>  cdc <dig>  mcm <dig>  and cdc <dig>  the amino acid sequence of both tags is given in figure s <dig> . we obtained conditional mutants for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. no reduction of viability at restrictive conditions was observed for modified kog <dig> and cdc <dig>  whereas gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and gfp-codc1-tdegf-tagged cdc <dig> and cyr <dig> as well as mcm1-gfp-codc1-tdegf, cdc5-gfp-codc1-tdegf, and cdc14-gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp led to severe growth defects . this demonstrates that the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and gfp-codc1-tdegf tags can be used to create conditional mutants. a possible explanation for the differences between gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and gfp-codc1-tdegf mutants might lie in changes of target protein levels induced by the gfp-codc1-tdegf tag at permissive conditions, as we found that the gfp-codc1-tdegf construct is destabilized without tev protease cleavage . indeed, steady state levels of the essential proteins modified with the gfp-codc1-tdegf tag were reduced in comparison with the corresponding gfp-tagged proteins . however, growth of the mutants was only slightly affected at permissive conditions on glucose containing media . a reason could be that most yeast proteins are synthesized at much higher levels than necessary for survival under lab conditions  <cit> .

additionally, we followed the cleavage of the fusion proteins by the ptev+ protease using immunoblotting. we observed cleavage in case of cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cyr <dig>  and mcm <dig> . due to the absence of clear signals for cdc20-, or kog1-gfp-codc1-tdegf , it is not clear why creation of conditional mutants failed for these proteins.

we performed live-cell imaging with cells expressing cdc14-gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and cdc48-gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp fusion proteins. the cdc14-gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp fusion protein localized to the nucleolus, as expected, whereas cdc48-gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp mislocalized to several very bright spots . the gfp and rfp fluorescence dropped down to roughly 10% of the initial levels in both cases within three hours after ptev+ protease expression. the fluorescence did not change considerably in the absence of the protease .

we checked the consequences of cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cyr <dig>  and mcm <dig> depletion in vivo. all these proteins have essential functions during the yeast cell cycle, which were studied intensively with conventional mutants. loss of activity results in each case in a specific defect. it was found that cyr1- <dig> and cdc48-td mutants arrest with no bud at restrictive conditions  <cit> . a metaphase arrest was observed in the mcm1-110l mutant  <cit>  as well as the tdegf-cdc <dig> mutant  <cit>  and an anaphase arrest in case of cdc <dig> temperature-sensitive mutants  <cit> . to compare the phenotypes obtained by protein depletion with conventional mutants, we checked for cell cycle phenotypes based on spindle morphology and bud-size in gfp-codc1-tdegf mutants of cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cyr <dig> and mcm <dig>  we found that all gfp-codc1-tdegf mutants accumulated in a specific cell cycle stage if the ptev+ protease was present , matching the results, which were reported for other conditional mutants in the literature. in the absence of the ptev+ protease, we found no apparent difference to control cells . our data demonstrates that both, the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp and the gfp-codc1-tdegf tag can be used to create conditional mutants. in addition, the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp tag is useful for applications, which ask for observation of substrate cleavage using live-cell imaging.

creation of developmental process-specific mutants
another interesting application for the tipi system would be to use it as a method to deplete target proteins at a specific stage during a developmental process. we chose the developmental program of sporulation in s. cerevisiae as model process. sporulation is initiated by starvation in yeast and consists of the meiotic cell divisions followed by spore formation  <cit> . to restrict the expression of the ptev+ protease to meiosis, we used the ime <dig> promoter, which is active only during sporulation  <cit> . as it is known that loss of cdc <dig> or cdc <dig> results in defects during the first meiotic division  <cit> , we selected them as target proteins for n-degron and c-degron dependent depletion, respectively. we fused the tdegf tag under control of the cyc <dig> promoter, which is repressed during meiosis and spore formation  <cit> , to the 5'-end of cdc <dig>  this led to reduction of gfp-tdegf-cdc <dig> levels, whereas additional expression of the ptev+ protease led to complete absence  and a defect in spore formation, most likely due to a block in the first meiotic division . we added the gfp-codc1-tdegf tag to the 3'-end of cdc <dig> and subjected the cells to sporulation conditions. surprisingly, the cdc5-gfp-codc1-tdegf containing cells sporulated in the presence of the ptev+ protease . however, high-level production of the ptev+ protease achieved by transformation of the cells with a high-copy plasmid containing the ptev+ protease gene resulted in a block of sporulation in the meiotic prophase . high-level production of the ptev+ protease alone did not change sporulation behavior of wild type yeast cells . thus, the tipi system is a valuable technique to study developmental processes. timely expression of the tev protease during a specific cell cycle stage or a developmental process allows control of target protein abundance during that stage.

CONCLUSIONS
the bidirectional degron can be fused to a target protein n-terminally, c-terminally or placed internally. activation of the degrons is achieved by cleavage with the tobacco etch virus protease, resulting in quick degradation of the target protein. thus the method provides a high degree of freedom to the user in terms of target protein modification with the bidirectional degron and control of tev protease production. however, the usage might be constrained for some applications. the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp tag is rather big as it contains two different fluorescent proteins. on the one hand this allows following cleavage of the tag by live-cell imaging, but on the other hand it limits the repertoire of additional fluorophores. the smaller gfp-codc1-tdegf tag, which lacks the rfp, destabilizes the target protein in the absence of the tev protease resulting in a reduction of protein levels. even some of the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp-tagged proteins exhibited reduced steady state levels , but less pronounced than in case of the gfp-codc1-tdegf-modified proteins. as we did not observe destabilization of the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp tester protein without tev protease cleavage , this decrease might be caused by the leakiness of the gal <dig> promoter  <cit>  resulting in weak expression of the tev protease. another possible explanation might be that the gfp-codc1-tdegf-rfp tag changes the efficiency of protein synthesis. the normal or only slightly affected growth of the conditional mutants at permissive conditions  could be explained by the observation that most yeast proteins are synthesized in excess  <cit> . a new construct, lacking the gfp and keeping the rfp, might be a way to decrease the size of the construct and to circumvent the problem of reduced protein abundance.

the c- and n-degron we used to construct the bidirectional degron are based on conserved degradation mechanisms and are known to work in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . therefore, protein depletion utilizing the tipi system should be possible in animals as well, as it has been shown already that cell type specific usage of the tev protease in drosophila melanogaster is feasible  <cit> . in synthetic biology approaches the tipi system might be employed to implement protein destabilization into regulatory circuits or to cleave a protein artificially. advantageous is that the system is reversible  <cit>  and allows genetic control of protein stability. furthermore, the degradation tag and the tev protease are heterologous proteins or protein domains. therefore, potentially harmful interactions with cellular components are minimized. previously, chromosome separation has been studied using tev protease cleavage  <cit> , but without incorporation of conditional degrons. our work enhances the existing techniques, as it provides the possibility to inflict different fates to the n- and c-terminus of the target protein after cleavage. destabilization of one or the other is achieved using the right combination of degron and stabilizing sequence . this might be a way to probe for regulatory domains or to create separation-of-function-mutants at protein level. these applications are unique to the tipi system and exemplify its value as a cell biology tool to manipulate protein abundance and activity in vivo.
