BACKGROUND
yersinia ruckeri is a gram-negative bacterium alternating between planktonic and host interaction states. it is the causative agent of enteric redmouth disease  affecting mainly salmonids in fish farms, which leads to important economic losses in aquaculture worldwide. four serological groups  <cit>  and two biotypes  <cit>  of y. ruckeri are currently proposed. amongst them, serotype  <dig> is the most virulent, being commonly isolated from outbreaks in fish farms. whereas the mechanisms involved in the virulence of human pathogenic yersinia species have been studied in depth, only a few pathogenic mechanisms of y. ruckeri have been described . in this context, of special interest is the work of furones et al.  <cit> , who found an association between the virulence of y. ruckeri serotype i strains and the presence of a heat-sensitive factor , identified as a sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  band of approximately 120 kda from cell extracts. the strains were classified in hsf+ and hsf− in terms of the presence/absence of the factor  <cit> . experiments carried out by injection challenge with hsf+ strains caused high mortalities in rainbow trout. in contrast, hsf− strains did not cause mortality. these authors concluded that hsf appeared to be a relevant virulence factor in y. ruckeri. in order to be able to distinguish hsf+ and hsf− strains routinely, furones et al.  <cit>  developed a differential culture medium containing sds and the coomassie brilliant blue dye. in this medium, the colonies of the hsf+ strains appeared as white, due to a creamy deposit around the colony, whereas those of hsf− strains did not form this deposit and became deeply blue.

given the relationship between the presence of the hsf and the virulence of y. ruckeri, we decided it would be interesting to investigate the gene coding for this factor. the hsf was found to be produced by an alkyl sulphatase, a protein which is not related to the virulence of the bacterium, but with potential usefulness for removing surfactant from the environment.

RESULTS
creamy white y. ruckeri colony phenotype  growing in the presence of sds is caused by an alkyl sulphatase 
a mini-tn <dig> km <dig> y. ruckeri transposon library was screened for colonies lacking the creamy white deposit around the colonies on tsa medium containing sds and coomassie brilliant blue . southern blot and sequence analysis of the interrupted genes in several blue coloured colonies showed that all of them presented a unique chromosomal transposon insertion in a  <dig>  bp open reading frame. putative − <dig>  and − <dig>  promoter sequences, and ribosome–binding site  were identified upstream of the orf, and a stem-loop palindromic sequence corresponding to a rho-independent terminator was located at the 3′end of the gene .figure  <dig>

the product of the interrupted gene, a protein of  <dig> amino acids, shows a high degree of identity with other proteins defined as alkyl sulphatases or sds hydrolases from different bacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa  , thiocystis violascens  , vibrio cholerae   and pseudomonas aeruginosa   <cit> .

in silico analysis indicated that the protein carries an n-terminal signal peptide of  <dig> amino acid residues and contains two domains: the cl <dig>  characteristic of the metalo-β-lactamase family, and the cog <dig>  typical of alkyl sulphatases . both domains are present in the sdsa and sdsa <dig> alkyl sulphatases from pseudomonas sp. atcc <dig>   <cit>  and p. aeruginosa pao <dig>   <cit> , respectively. additionally, the protein harbours, at its n-terminal sequence, a zn2+-binding motif  characteristic of metallo-β-lactamase-related enzymes, also present in the sdsa and sdsa <dig> alkyl sulphatases  <cit>  .

the in silico results were in concordance with data obtained from the analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of the creamy-white compound produced by cultures of the y. ruckeri parental strain grown in nb with  <dig> % sds. the compound was identified as 1-dodecanol , the molecule resulting from the hydrolysis of sds by an alkyl sulphatase  <cit> .

the phylogenetic tree, based on the yras protein of different microorganisms, showed that y. ruckeri does not share any evolutionary origin with the bacteria harbouring an yras-homologous protein . however, all the bacteria that are closer to y. ruckeri in the phylogenetic tree, with the exception of sinorhizobium meliloti, are also aquatic. one example is photobacterium profundum, a psychrophilic marine bacterium belonging to the vibrionaceae family. proteins homologous to yras were also found in other enterobacteriaceae species such as klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella variicola and salmonella enterica. however, the proteins of these bacteria are very distant in the phylogenetic tree from the yras protein of y. ruckeri .

yras is the hsf factor
in order to go further into the relationship between the yras gene and the hsf+ phenotype, defined by a creamy deposit around the colony on sds containing media , one of the obtained mutants showing an hsf− colony phenotype  was complemented with the yras gene. as can be observed in figure 3c, a complete reversion of the hsf− to hsf+ colony phenotype was achieved. furthermore, when the yras gene was introduced in y. ruckeri  <dig>  a serotype ii strain showing an hsf− phenotype, the colony phenotype changed to hsf+ . both, yras mutant and  <dig> strains, when complemented with the yras gene, originated a larger creamy deposit than that of the parental strain, probably owing to gene dosage effect . in conclusion, the yras gene is responsible for the hsf+ phenotype of y. ruckeri colonies on sds-containing media.figure  <dig>

to confirm that the yras protein was linked to the hsf factor, defined by furones et al.  <cit>  as a 120 kda band in sds-page gels, cell extracts from the different y. ruckeri parental, yras mutant,  <dig> and complemented strains were obtained and separated by sds-page under the conditions previously described  <cit> . figure 4a, lane  <dig>  shows the presence in the y. ruckeri parental strain of a band, resulting from the degradation of the sds present in the gel, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 120 kda. this band disappeared in the yras mutant  and returned when the mutant was complemented with the yras gene . this band was also absent in the hsf−y. ruckeri  <dig> strain , and again appeared when this strain was yras complemented . the presence in the gel of this 120 kda band was temperature-dependent. indeed, when the cell extracts of the hsf+ strains were heated to 100°c for 10 min, before sds-page separation, the 120 kda band was absent . moreover, when the gel was stained with sudan black dye the 120 kda band became stained . both types of behaviour were defined previously for the hsf factor  <cit> .figure  <dig>

hsf+/hsf− phenotype correlates with the presence/absence of the yras gene in y. ruckeri strains
a set of y. ruckeri strains, including some used in the study of furones et al.  <cit> , were analysed by pcr for the presence of the yras gene and also tested for colony morphology on sds-containing medium. in all the cases, there was a match between colony morphology and the presence of the yras gene: all the hsf+ strains harboured the yras gene and presented a white creamy deposit surrounding the colonies, whereas in hsf− strains the yras gene was absent and colonies lacked the white creamy deposit .figure  <dig>

the yras gene is not involved in virulence and it has no nutritional role
the presence in y. ruckeri of the hsf factor, now defined as the product of the yras enzyme, was previously associated with virulence  <cit> . in order to define the role of this factor in virulence, ld <dig> experiments were carried out in groups of  <dig> rainbow trout fish  intraperitoneally injected with 100 μl of parental and yras mutant strains dilutions from  <dig> to 108 cfu/ml. fish death occurred along the 7 days period and cumulative mortality curves were similar for both strains in each dilution . at the end of this period, ld <dig> values obtained were  <dig>  × 102 cfu , and  <dig>  × 102 cfu , respectively. these results showed that the yras protein is not a virulence factor.

constitutive expression of the yras gene seems to occur, since the yras protein is present in both nb and m9c media. a first approach to the role of the yras protein was inferred from experiments in which glucose was added to the m9c medium containing 1%  sds. after 96 h of incubation at 28°c, no degradation at all of sds by the parental strain occurred when glucose was present in the culture medium. in the same way, the parental strain showed an hsf− phenotype when glucose was present in m9c medium containing sds . this result could be a consequence of a catabolic repression mechanism involved in the regulation of the yras gene. therefore, it would be possible that y. ruckeri uses sds as an additional carbon source for bacterial growth. however, when the different y. ruckeri strains were incubated in m <dig> solid and liquid media containing different amounts of sds as sole carbon source no growth at all was observed. definitely, y. ruckeri sds degradation by yras is not linked to the utilization of this detergent as a sole carbon source. moreover, the presence in the culture media of different amounts of sulphate did not produce any visible alteration in sds degradation, suggesting that sulphate is not involved in the regulation of the yras gene.

the protein yras is not involved in sds-resistance; instead, this property lies within the acrab-tolc system
growth of the yras mutant strain in nb medium containing  <dig> % sds at 28°c was similar to that of the parental strain, although a greater decrease in cell viability occurred in the mutant strain during the stationary phase of growth . sds was totally degraded by the parental strain after 24 h of incubation at 28°c, but no degradation at all occurred during the growth of the yras mutant . percentages of  <dig> % and 1% sds were not totally degraded by the parental strain, probably because nutrient depletion occurred before all the detergent was hydrolysed.figure  <dig>

parental and yras mutant strains. cultures were incubated in nb containing  <dig> %  sds at 28°c and 250 rpm and, at different times, samples were withdrawn and growth determined by plate counting. simultaneously, the presence of sds in the culture supernatant was quantified by the stains-all method  <cit> . continuous line and dotted line represents the growth and sds degradation of parental  and yras−  strains. data represent the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. growth was similar for the two strains, but sds was completely degraded by the parental strain after 24 h of incubation, whereas no degradation at all occurred by the yras mutant strain.



to examine the role of the yras protein in the physiology of the bacterium, the mic of sds for different y. ruckeri strains was determined. the results indicated that an identical level of resistance to sds  was found amongst y. ruckeri parental, yras mutant and complemented yras+ strains. in addition, no major resistance to sds was found when the y. ruckeri  <dig> strain was complemented with the yras gene, the mic for both strains was  <dig> % . these results indicated that the alkyl sulphatase is not a relevant sds-resistance mechanism in the bacterium. similarly, both parental and mutant strains presented the same mic for triton x- <dig>  tween  <dig> and bile salts .

in order to elucidate the system responsible for the high sds resistance of the bacterium, a mini-tn <dig> km <dig> mutant library of y. ruckeri was screened to select a mutant unable to grow in the presence of  <dig> % sds. the gene whose interruption was responsible for that phenotype codes for a protein homologous to acra, one of the components of the acrab-tolc system. this is involved in pumping out of the cell a wide variety of compounds including detergents and antibiotics in bacteria such as escherichia coli and salmonella enterica . phenotypic analysis of this mutant showed that it was sensitive to sds, having a mic of  <dig> % w/v, instead of the  <dig> % w/v of the parental strain. additionally, the acra mutant was significantly more sensitive than the parental strain to triton x- <dig>  bile salts and the antimicrobials tetracycline, oxitetracycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol and oxolinic acid .

discussion
virulence in y. ruckeri was previously correlated with the presence of the hsf+ colony phenotype  <cit> . in this work, this hsf+ phenotype was linked to the product of the yras gene which corresponds to an alkyl sulphatase. this enzyme is involved in the degradation of alkyl sulphate esters, such as sds, generating as a first product water insoluble 1-dodecanol. this compound, which, in y. ruckeri is accumulated in the medium, forms a white creamy deposit around colonies and leads to a band of 120 kda in sds-page gels. both phenotypes were previously observed by furones et al.,  <cit> . according to in silico analysis, the yras enzyme falls into a new class of alkyl sulphatases characterized by the presence of a metallo-β-lactamase domain and found mostly in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . this kind of enzymes cleaves alkyl sulphates such as sds into the corresponding alcohol.

the yras activity was identified in sds-page as a diffuse sds-hydrolytic band of 120 kda, approximately. this result is coincident with the molecular mass of hsf described by furones et al.  <cit> . according to this, and taking into account that the molecular mass of the yras, deduced from the amino acid sequence, was  <dig>  kda, the active form of the enzyme should correspond to a protein dimer structure. this also agrees with the dimeric structure of the active form of the sdsa <dig> from p. aeruginosa, which provides resistance to high concentrations of sds  <cit> . in the same way, a lipid core structure for hsf was suggested, since the 120 kda band was stained with sudan black, a dye used for lipid detection  <cit> . our results showed that the 120 kda band was also stained with this dye. therefore, the lipidic core structure of hsf suggested by furones et al.  <cit>  was correct, since it is likely that the compound stained with sudan black is the fatty alcohol 1-dodecanol, the product of the alkyl sulphatase action on sds. nevertheless, we must link the hsf to the alkyl sulphatase rather than to the product of sds degradation by the enzyme. this fact is consistent with the absence of the band when the cell extract was heat-inactivated before electrophoresis. comparative analysis of parental and yras mutant y. ruckeri strains, complementation studies, as well as pcr detection of the yras gene in different strains of y. ruckeri, confirm that yras is responsible for the production of the hsf factor. these results, together with the presence of a single 120 kda band in the cell extracts of the parental y. ruckeri strain, strongly suggested that, under these experimental conditions, there were no additional alkyl sulphatases involved in the degradation of sds, and the yras protein was the only one responsible for this activity. this differs from different reports that indicated that bacteria able to degrade alkyl sulphate esters possess multiple sulphatase enzymes  <cit> .

our results indicate that there was no relation between the presence of hsf factor and virulence in y. ruckeri. indeed, results of the rainbow trout infection experiments carried out with the parental and yras mutant strains, showed that both strains behaved similarly as virulent bacteria. these results are not incompatible with the one obtained by furones et al.,  <cit>  because although yras is not a virulence factor its presence could be linked to the existence in the bacterium of specific virulence factors. in this way, yras could be a hallmark of virulence even though it is not involved in pathogenesis. this could explain why hsf+ strains are always virulent  <cit> .

the yras protein was produced by the bacterium when growing in media lacking sds and therefore, it seems that the gene is constitutively expressed. however, yras activity was absent when the bacterium was grown in the presence of glucose, suggesting a regulation of the yras gene by catabolic repression. nevertheless, the absence of bacterial growth in the presence of sds as a sole carbon source as well as the accumulation of 1-docecanol in the culture media, indicate that y. ruckeri, in contrast to p. aeruginosa  <cit> , is unable to use this detergent as sole carbon source. 1-dodecanol, resulting from sds degradation by the yras protein, is likely to enter the bacterium where it would be oxidized to 1-dodecanoic acid by the action of the appropriate alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to be assimilated as a carbon source. therefore, it seems that the absence of one or more of these systems could be a problem which prevents further metabolic assimilation of 1-dodecanol by y. ruckeri.

no alteration in detergent hydrolysis by y. ruckeri was observed when inorganic sulphate was added to the media. our results suggest that in y. ruckeri this enzyme is not involved in the sulphur cycle and is not a system for scavenging sulphate from the environment. whereas bacterial aryl sulphatases have been involved in sulphate scavenging  <cit> , alkyl sulphatases seem to have additional roles  <cit> . in conclusion, and according to the results, it seems that the yras gene is not related to carbon or sulphur utilization.

there are many reports of bacteria able to degrade different amounts of sds. for example, a p. putida sp <dig> strain was able to completely degrade  <dig> % sds in 16 h  <cit> . however, most of the sds-degrading bacteria isolated presented lower rates, needing  <dig> to 10 days of incubation to completely degrade percentages of  <dig>  to  <dig> % of sds  <cit> . interestingly, y. ruckeri degrades  <dig> % sds in nb within 24 h of incubation at 28°c, and can grow in the presence of up to  <dig> % of this detergent. introduction of the yras gene in y. ruckeri strains lacking the capacity to degrade sds enables these strains to do so. however, y. ruckeri sds resistance is not yras-dependent since the growth curve of the yras mutant strain in the presence of  <dig> % sds was similar to that of the parental strain. to our knowledge, it is here established for the first time that a gene involved in sds degradation is not associated with the resistance of the bacterium to this detergent. usually it is assumed that the presence of alkyl sulphatases in a particular bacterium is related to its resistance to toxic alkyl sulphate molecules. however, in fact, resistance of y. ruckeri to sds lies in the acrab-tolc system, a pump involved in the excretion of multiple compounds such as antimicrobials and detergents in different bacteria , as was indicated by the analysis of an sds-sensitive y. ruckeri acra mutant. therefore, in this particular case, and probably in other bacteria bearing this kind of sulphatase-coding gene, it may be that the yras gene is only present in naturally sds resistant y. ruckeri strains. these characteristics, high sds resistance and degradation capacity, make this bacterium potentially useful as a tool for removing anionic surfactants from different sources.

it is interesting to speculate about the presence of this enzyme in a bacterium alternating between planktonic and host interaction states. the results indicate that the protein does not have a significant role in the infectious process or in nutrition or detergent resistance. however, the constitutive expression in nutritionally rich and poor media suggests that the protein provides an advantage to the bacterium in its natural environment. the high resistance to sds depending on the acrab-tolc system, together with the high rate of degradation of this compound by the alkyl sulphatase yras, reinforces the potential usefulness of bacteria possessing high expression systems of both mechanisms in the fight against surfactant pollution in bioremediation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have showed in this work the nature of the previously defined hsf factor of y. ruckeri as the product of sds degradation by the yras alkyl sulphatase. although in former works it was established a correlation between the possession of hsf and the virulence of this microorganism, our results indicate that the factor is not necessary for bacterial pathogenicity. yras was able to degrade sds but it does not contribute, at least in a relevant way, to the high sds resistance observed in this bacterium. this function corresponds to the acrab-tolc system.
