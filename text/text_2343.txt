BACKGROUND
estrogen plays essential roles in the development, growth control and differentiation of the normal mammary gland. however, it is well documented that endogenous estrogens are powerful mitogens critical for the initiation and progression of human breast and gynecological cancers  <cit> . this cell proliferation signal is mediated by the estrogen receptors , members of the nuclear receptor family that function both as signal transducers and transcription factors to modulate expression of target genes  <cit> . there are two main subtypes of estrogen receptors: erα and erβ that generally can form homo- and heterodimers before binding to dna. although the dna binding domains of these receptors are very similar, the overall degree of homology is low  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation of target genes in response to 17β-estradiol  is mediated by two main mechanisms. in one, the e2-er complex binds to a specific dna sequence called the estrogen response element , this receptor-ligand dna bounded complex interacts with co-regulatory proteins, promoting chromatin remodeling and bridging with the general gene transcription machinery thus resulting in transcription initiation  <cit> . alternatively, the ligand-er complex can interact with other dna-bound transcription factors that in turn bind dna sequences   <cit> . erα and erβ have different affinities for different response elements and exhibit distinct transcriptional properties. additionally, e <dig> also exerts rapid, non-genomic effects attributed to cell membrane-initiated signaling  <cit> .

approximately two-thirds of all breast cancers are erα  at the time of diagnosis and expression of this receptor is determinant of a tumor phenotype that is associated with hormone-responsiveness. patients with tumors that express erα have a longer disease-free interval and overall survival than patients with tumors that lack erα expression  <cit> . however, the association between erα expression and hormonal responsiveness is not perfect: approximately 30% of erα-positive tumors are not hormone-responsive while 5–15% of erα-negative tumors respond to hormonal therapy  <cit> . the molecular basis for the association between erα expression, hormonal responsiveness and breast cancer prognosis remains unclear.

several studies have been carried out using cdna and oligonucleotide microarrays identifying breast cancer subclasses possessing distinct biological and clinical properties  <cit> . among the distinctions made to date, the clearest separation was observed between erα  and erα  tumors  <cit> . it has been suggested that there are sets of genes expressed in association with erα that could play an important role in determining the hormone-responsive breast cancer phenotype  <cit> . erα is obviously likely to be important for the e <dig> induced proliferative response predominantly via the regulation of estradiol-responsive genes. nevertheless, the expression of additional subsets of genes not necessarily directly regulated by estrogen may also be fundamental in defining the breast cancer hormone-responsive phenotype.

to further elucidate the molecular basis of estrogen-dependent breast carcinogenesis, we here report a comparative transcriptome profiling of invasive breast tumors based on erα status obtained by sage. the sage method provides a statistical description of the mrna population present in a cell without prior selection of the genes to be studied, and this constitutes a major advantage  <cit> . the breast cancer sage comparative analysis was combined with promoter sequence analysis of genes of interest using high-throughput methods of high-affinity ere identification. in order to have an even more comprehensive picture we also performed a cross-platform comparison between sage and dna microarray studies.

RESULTS
biomarkers of erα status in breast carcinomas
the primary goal of our study was to identify the most commonly deregulated genes in invasive breast carcinomas related to erα status. to this end sage data was obtained from a set of primary breast carcinomas. thus, a breast cancer sage database of almost  <dig>  million tags was analyzed, representing over  <dig>  tag species. we performed a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of gene expression profiles using a recently developed supervised method  <cit> , to identify the most representative differentially expressed transcripts between tumors groups, i.e. erα  vs. erα  breast tumors.

this statistical analysis revealed  <dig> genes differentially expressed  between erα  and erα  primary breast carcinomas . among the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> were up-modulated and  <dig> were down-modulated transcripts in erα  tumors.

the most commonly over-expressed transcripts in erα  tumors were: trefoil factor  <dig> , synaptotagmin-like  <dig> , regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis  <dig> , dual specificity phosphatase  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig> , necdin homolog , n-acetyltransferase  <dig>  and caspase recruitment domain family  <dig>  .

to validate novel erα associated genes detected by sage not reported in other studies, we performed real time rt-pcr analysis of representative transcripts in an independent set of  <dig> invasive ductal breast carcinomas. in agreement with our sage analysis, we detected statistical differences in the over-expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> evaluated transcripts in erα  breast tumors including: signal peptide cub domain egf-like  <dig>  , sytl <dig> , kiaa <dig> protein , tetraspan  <dig>  , myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog  , epidermal growth factor-like  <dig>  , nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  , and enolase  <dig>   . a trend of borderline significance was detected for the lectin galactoside-binding protein   transcript .

scube <dig>  encodes a secreted and cell-surface protein containing egf and cub domains that defines a novel gene family  <cit> . the epidermal growth factor  motif is found in many extracellular proteins that play an important role during development, functioning as secreted growth factors, transmembrane receptors, signaling molecules, and important components of the extracellular matrix. the cub domain is found in several proteins implicated in the regulation of extracellular process such as cell-cell communication and adhesion  <cit> . expression of scube <dig> has been detected in vascular endothelium and may play important roles in development, inflammation and perhaps carcinogenesis  <cit> .

the celsr <dig> gene  encodes a protein member of the nonclassic-type cadherins . these 7-pass transmembrane proteins have nine cadherin domains, seven-epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin a g-type repeats  <cit> . it is postulated that these proteins are receptors involved in cell adhesion and receptor-ligand interactions  <cit>  playing a role in developmental processes and cell growth/ maintenance in epithelial and neuronal cells  <cit> .

sytl <dig>  contains an n-terminal slp homology domain  than can specifically and directly bind the gtp-bound form of rab27a, a small gtp-binding protein involved in granule exocytosis in cytotoxic t lymphocytes  <cit> . we determined that over-expression of sytl <dig> is associated with erα  tumors . however, the potential role of this gene in breast carcinogenesis remains unknown.

eno <dig>  encodes one of three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals. this isoenzyme was described to be expressed in cells of neuronal origin. interestingly, in a recent report hao et al.  showed high expression of eno <dig> transcripts in breast cancer lymph node metastases when compared with primary breast tumors  <cit> .

the tspan <dig> gene  encodes a cell-surface protein member of the transmembrane  <dig> superfamily , involved in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. a number of tetraspanins were described as tumor-specific antigens, and it was suggested that the function of some tm4sf proteins may be particularly relevant to tumor cell metastasis  <cit> . sugiura and berditchevski  observed that tspan <dig> protein complexes may control the invasive migration of tumor cells and contribute to ecm-induced production of mmp <dig> in breast cancer cell line  <cit> .

nr4a <dig>  a nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group a gene  encodes an orphan member of the steroid-thyroid hormone-retinoid receptor superfamily whose members mainly act as transcriptional factors to positively or negatively regulate gene expression and play roles in regulating growth and apoptosis  <cit> . a role for nr4a <dig> in cell proliferation has been previously reported. it was shown that its expression is rapidly induced by various mitogenic stimuli such as: serum growth factor, epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor  <cit> .

taken together, the genes that we identified and validated appear to be involved in signaling pathways related to cell proliferation, invasion and metastatic processes, but their exact role in breast carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated.

gene ontology analysis
classification of genes based on gene ontology  terms is a powerful bioinformatics tool suited for the analysis of dna microarray and sage data. analysis of go annotation allows one to identify families of genes that may play significant roles related to specific molecular or biological processes in expression profiles  <cit> . we used the expression analysis systematic explorer software   <cit>  to annotate the  <dig> deregulated genes according to the information provided by the go consortium  <cit> . the go database provided annotation for 80%  of the genes identified by sage. results of this analysis are shown in figure  <dig> and in detail in additional data file  <dig> 

we observed that 31% of erα associated transcripts are involved in biological processes related to cell growth and/or maintenance, 21% are related to cell communication, and 16% are related to regulation of transcription. approximately 16% of these deregulated genes are related to molecular functions associated with dna binding and more specifically with transcription factor activity  . interestingly, using the enrichment go terms analysis, we identified statistical significant over-representation of specific groups of proteins including: metal ion binding proteins , calcium ion binding proteins  and steroid hormone receptor activity related proteins  . the go cluster related to steroid hormone receptor activity proteins includes: estrogen receptor  <dig> , androgen receptor , hydroxysteroid 17-β dehydrogenase  <dig> , glucocorticoid receptor , oxysterol binding protein , and retinoic acid receptor α . the observation of functionally related groups of genes identified in the sage dataset via go over representation analysis allows the identification of distinct biological pathways directly or indirectly associated to estrogen response related processes and provides the basis for future mechanistic studies.

identification of high-affinity estrogen response elements
we used a recently reported genome-wide high-affinity ere database  <cit>  to identify putative eres in the promoter regions of the sage-identified  <dig> up-modulated genes in erα  breast tumors. we identified  <dig> eres distributed on  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes  . seventy-two percent of these genes contain one high affinity ere  and 28% of them contain two or more eres in proximity to the transcriptional start sites   . these eres can be located in both coding and non-coding sequences such as was described by bourdeau et al.  <cit> .

the observed frequency of these elements in our study was  <dig> eres in  <dig> kb . compared with the expected frequency from random distribution of high-affinity eres found in the genome    <cit> , the number of individual eres was  <dig> fold higher than expected by chance .

fifty percent  of the detected eres mapped within a  <dig> kb region 5' of the tss, while the rest mapped to 3' regions . approximately 68% of eres mapped within the region between - <dig> to + <dig> kb from the tss; in agreement with those observations of bourdeau et al.  <cit> . however, it remains to be determined whether distantly located eres  are functional e2-er binding sites related to transcriptional activation.

of the validated transcripts previously discussed , we detected high-affinity eres on the upstream or downstream regions related to the tss of sytl <dig> , tspan <dig> , celsr <dig> , and nr4a <dig> .

it is interesting to note that we were unable to identify high-affinity eres on the majority of deregulated genes  associated with a positive er α status. the possibility exists that many of these genes are transcriptionally regulated by non-ere mediated mechanisms such as those involving er binding to the ap <dig> or sp <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . the ap <dig> transcription factor is a heterodimer formed by jun and fos family member proteins that binds to the phorbol diester  response element as well as to the ap <dig> consensus dna sequence. in this pathway, er plays a co-activator role for ap <dig>  <cit> . the er/ap- <dig> complex can confer estrogen responsiveness to additional subset of genes found in our dataset such as: ovalbumin  and c-fos ; two transcripts detected as over-expressed in erα  breast tumors by sage . similarly the er/sp <dig> complex confers estrogen responsiveness to genes such as: retinoic acid receptor α  , vascular endothelial growth factor  , insulin-like growth factor binding protein- <dig>   and heat shock protein  <dig>  ; four transcripts detected as over-expressed in erα  tumors in our study .

an additional pathway of transcription regulation by estrogen involves the er-related receptors , nuclear orphan receptors with significant homology to ers, which do not bind estrogen and have unknown physiological ligands. errs are known to bind to the steroidogenic factor  <dig> response element  and also bind to classic eres, by means of which they exert constitutive transcriptional activity  <cit> . we detected over-expression of the nuclear orphan receptor nr4a <dig> by sage and subsequently validated this observation by real time rt-pcr . interestingly, and as previously mentioned, the genomic region 5' and 3' to the tss of nr4a <dig> contain high-affinity eres. interaction between ers and errs has been observed in the transcriptional regulation of certain genes such as the human breast cancer related gene tff1/ps <dig>  the promoter of which is not only activated by ers but also by errs  <cit> .

as described, erα can mediate estrogenic response through multiple genomic and non-genomic mechanisms, many of which affect proteins and pathways not necessarily directly or exclusively associated with erα. thus it is worth stressing that it will the totality of deregulated proteins the ones that ultimately define the phenotype of erα  breast carcinomas regardless of whether a "direct association" with er transcriptional regulation exists or not.

in vivo versus in vitro estrogen induced global gene expression findings
the sage profiles for e2-responsive genes in mcf- <dig> cell line, previously reported by us  <cit> , was compared with the er status genes expression profile found in primary breast carcinomas. briefly, we detected  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed  in mcf- <dig> treated cells,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated transcripts. basically and as reported charpentier et al, we observed a general up-regulation cell cycle progression-related genes including: cct <dig>  ccnd <dig>  pes <dig>  ran/tc <dig>  calm <dig>  calm2; and tumor-associated genes such as: rfp, d52l <dig>  tff1/ps <dig>  cav <dig>  and ndka among others  <cit> . these together could contribute to the stimulation of proliferation and the suppression of apoptosis by e2-er transcriptional regulation.

by comparing the in vitro  and in vivo  gene expression profiles, to our surprise we detect that only few transcripts: tff <dig>  ccnd <dig>  h <dig>  srebf <dig> and wwp <dig> behaved similarly  in both studies. this is similar to observations made previously by meltzer and co-workers whom showed that the majority of genes regulated in cell culture do not predict er status in breast carcinomas  <cit> . this result suggests that the estrogen-responsive pathways affected in vitro represent only a minor portion of the global gene expression profiles characteristic of erα  breast tumors. this maybe in great part the result of the heterogenous nature of bulk tumor tissue but in addition, the in vitro response of a single cell line to e <dig>  in this particular case the widely used mcf- <dig> cells, may not faithfully reproduce the physiological effects of er signaling in vivo.

cross-platform gene expression profiling comparison
in order to identify and validate the most reliable set of genes able to discriminate breast carcinomas based on their erα status, we performed a cross-platform comparison between the described sage dataset with two previously reported breast cancer studies based on dna microarray methods  <cit> . van't veer et al.  <cit>  reported the gene expression profile of  <dig> primary breast tumors based on oligonucleotide microarrays containing  <dig>  elements . in another study, sotiriou et al.  <cit>  reported the gene expression profile of  <dig> primary breast tumors using a cdna microarray containing  <dig> elements. only files containing differentially expressed genes associated to erα status tumors from both microarrays studies were obtained for cross-platform comparison .

among the three platforms, a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified as over-expressed in erα  breast tumors. one hundred and eighty-three genes were identified by more than one method . eleven of these  <dig> genes were identified by all three methods displaying over-expression in erα  breast carcinomas: estrogen receptor  <dig> , gata-binding protein  <dig> , mucin  <dig> , v-myb-myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog  , x-box-binding protein  <dig> , hydroxysteroid 17-β dehydrogenase  <dig> , btg family member  <dig> , transforming growth factor β- <dig> , member ras oncogene family , start domain containing  <dig> , and kiaa <dig> .

# transcripts tags changing > 2-fold when compared with the average expression of erα  tumors. underlined genes correspond to the transcripts cross-validated among all three compared platforms.

one hundred and fourteen genes were identified as over-expressed by oligonucleotide microarrays  <cit>  and sage in erα  tumors, representing a non-random significant number of overlapping genes based on normal approximation to the binomial distribution  . sixty-six genes were identified as over-expressed in erα  tumors by both dna microarrays platforms . the set of  <dig> genes overlapping between cdna microarrays  <cit>  and sage were not statistical significant .

interestingly, we found a higher number of overlapping genes between the oligonucleotide microarray and sage platforms , while only  <dig> genes were observed overlapping when comparing both microarray platforms. it is worth noting that 96% of the  <dig> genes  identified as overexpressed by the cdna microarray method  <cit>  were included within the total set of elements in the oligonucleotide microarray platform  <cit> . in other words, it appears that a better correlation was observed between sage and oligonucleotide arrays, than between both dna microarray methods.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our comprehensive comparison of overlapping genes across different gene expression platforms provides validation for a significant number of transcripts identified as highly expressed in erα  breast tumors. more importantly this analysis identifies the most promising biomarkers for further evaluation as erα associated genes in breast cancer. furthermore, the identified proteins may be of value as breast cancer prognostic indicators analyzed either as a group or individually. it is also likely that groups of co-regulated genes in erα  breast cancers may be associated to the hormonal control of mammary epithelial cells growth and differentiation. finally, a better understanding of the signaling networks controlled or associated with the estrogen response may lead to the identification of novel breast cancer therapeutic targets.
