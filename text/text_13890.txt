BACKGROUND
the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving photo system ii is a unique biochemical system that is capable of oxidizing water molecules  <cit>  and is responsible for producing the almost totality of oxygen on earth  <cit> . psba  gene, along with three other chloroplast  genes, namely psbb , psbc  and psbd , encodes the core proteins complex in the chlo-roplasts of ferns  <cit> . precisely, psba  gene encodes d <dig> protein  in ferns. physical mapping and pastime sequencing unra-veled a set of genome rearrangements around psba gene in “higher” fern lineages  <cit> . based on completely and partially sequenced fern pastimes  <cit> , the psba gene often locates either to inverted repeat regions  or to the large single copy region . moreover, gene order around it is only found in one state in irs , but in two possible arrangements in lsc . impor-tantly, psba  gene duplicated when its location shifted from lsc to irs  <cit> . this shift mainly affected four fern orders: schizaeales, salviniales, cyatheales and polypodiales, accounting for over 90% of extant fern diversity. because both gene copies were preserved since the duplication, we sought to investigate the selective pressures that may drive the evolution of this interesting gene.

evolution after gene duplication has been a fundamental issue in evolutionary biology chiefly because of its direct link to the generation of novel functions and adaptations  <cit> . the opportunity for generating novel functions is, however, often balanced with the effects such duplications have on gene dosage  <cit> . the photosynthesis environment changed mainly as a result of the emergence of flowering plants  <cit> , and as the open sunny ground transformed into the closed shadowy canopy. for this reason, the biodiversity of other vascular plants largely decreased, and some lineages underwent extinction  <cit> . remarkably, rather than the result of being adept at holding on in the face of angiosperm domination, the leptosporangiate ferns may have the ability to capitalize upon it  <cit> . the underlying molecular functioning of this ability remains a mystery for evolutionary biologists, and the present study sheds some light on it. the colonization by these species of canopies angiosperm-dominated light environments sparks the idea that such extraordinary diversification may have been fuelled by functional innovation following psba  duplication. to disclose this obscurity, we performed a comprehensive analyze of the action of natural selection following the duplication in psba .

coevolving sites are non-independent amino acid sites during the course of protein evolution  <cit> . among the different sites with physical or functional relationships in one protein, one mutation is likely to trigger the corresponding mutations at related sites  <cit> . natural selection theory and nearly neutral theory have different explanations for the mechanism of these dynamic changes  <cit> . despite the debates on the underlying mechanism, the compensatory mutations among the interdependent amino acid sites provide an important approach to understand protein structure and function  <cit> . the identification of coevolving amino acid sites will not only play a prominent role in the annotations of the function of d <dig> protein, but will also reflect the evolutionary pattern of the particular protein.

to achieve a better understanding on the evolutionary biology of psba  genes in ferns, we focused on three aims: 1) identifying gene order states around psba  genes in  <dig> fern orders; 2) detecting the selective constraints in consequence of psba  gene duplication; and 3) unraveling the co-evolution pattern of d <dig> protein among fern lineages.

RESULTS
sampling and sequencing
mainly based on smith’s system  <cit>  and lehtonen’s recent study  <cit> , we sampled more species in order polypodiales  and cyatheales , which have significantly high current fern diversity on earth, and we selected at least one species from the  <dig> orders . to sum up, these  <dig> psba  sequences represented  <dig> orders and  <dig> families  providing reasonable coverage of the most taxon-rich lineage. all the sequenced  <dig> coding regions have 1059nt, coding  <dig> amino acid residues. along with their stop code,  <dig> currently determined psba sequences were uploaded to genbank .

*wbgcas is short for wuhan botanical garden, chinese academy of sciences, wuhan, hubei, china. flbg stands for shenzhen fairy lake botanical garden, shenzhen, guangdong,china. scbgcas means south china botanical garden, chinese academy of sciences, guangzhou, guangdong, china.

since the analysis of molecular adaptive evolution strictly rejects the termination codon  in a sequence  <cit> , coding sequences in dataset  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> were applied in the investigation of selective pressures.

phylogenetic analysis
the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees is non-sensitive to the stop codes  <cit> ; moreover, intergenic sequence of psba-trnh was widely accepted as good indicator for barcode of land plant  <cit> . coding sequences along with intergenic regions of psbatrnh in dataset  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were utilized for the reconstruction of the phylogenetic structures for better resolution .

*the positions of positively selected codons were showed in brackets. p value stands for the statistical significant levels of the models, which is preset before the data manipulation.

** the contexts of the dataset were introduced in additional file1table s <dig> 

in accordance with the phylogenetic structure in pre-vious documents and present analyses , we found that the combined dataset  <dig> might not be an accurate indicator for the reconstruction of fern phylogenetic structure under geological timescale. even though the currently gained tree partially coincided with other relevant results from smith’s system  <cit>  and lehtonen’s conclusion  <cit> , we could found several disagreements.

firstly, species from the same orders were in the same clades : 1) order ophioglossales in node 6; 2) order osmundales in node 9; 3) order gleicheniales in node 14; 4) order cyatheales in node  <dig> and 5) order polypodiales in node  <dig>  secondly, species from the same families were in the same sub-clade : 1) family ophioglossaceae in node 6; 2) family osmundaceae in node 9; 3) family gleicheniaceae in node 14; 4) family plagiogyriaceae in node 23; 5) family polypodiaceae in node  <dig>  thirdly, species from the same genera were together: 1) genus osmunda in node 9; 2) genus plagiogyria in node  <dig>  fourth, most esti-mated node ages had significant posterior probabilities .

* as showed in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  all the nodes in the phylogenetic tree were numbered and marked.

** diverge time of each branch was estimated in beast software and listed accordingly. the geological time scale  were inferred from the estimated diverge time of each nodes.

*** posterior probabilities  of every node were inferred via beast. four of them were lower than 95%: 1) node 11; 2) node 19; 3) node 20; and 4) node  <dig> 

the current phylogenetic tree along with timescale was not accurate according to other published literature  <cit> . i) partial structure was not the same with the known phylogeny : the order hymenophyllales was near to marattiales in our study rather than gleicheniales in well-known tree. ii) several best estimated node ages were not precise, such as node  <dig> and  <dig>  iii) four nodes had low posterior possi-bilities .

*the contexts of the dataset were introduced in additional file1table s <dig>  codons with pp > 95% were in bold. the phylogeny trees applied in the estimation were reconstructed throughout dataset introduced in additional file1table s <dig> accordingly.

**positions and posterior probability of the positively selected codons were showed in this column. the posterior probabilities were given via bayes empirical bayes  method.

gene order around psba  gene in ferns
results of the pcr amplification indicate that gene order around psba  gene in fern species could be mainly classified into three types: trnk-psba-trnh , matk-psba-trnh  and rps7-psba-trnh . when universal primers  from conserved sequence of trnk  and psba  were applied in pcr systems, five species  have positive reaction with the right sizes of the fragments. four species  showed positive results when the primers were from conserved sequence of matk and psba . other eleven species  showed positive results when the primers were from conserved sequence of rps <dig>  and psba  .

selective pressure in different psba genes
as showed in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we tested the action of natural selection in d <dig> protein using three datasets  comprising both presently determined sequences  and sequences retrieved from genbank .

we can found subtle positive selection signals in psba genes from fern species . however, when the species were divided into two groups as single and duplicated psba genes, only those from single copy harbored alike signals . as showed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  three codons  were found as positively selected sites from dataset  <dig> and none from dataset  <dig> throughout different mathematics models.

for the detection of positive selection we used nested maximum likelihood models allowing for variation in the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions rates  across codons, as implemented in paml and selecton  <cit> , and three models in datamonkey as well  <cit> . for each dataset, one likelihood ratio test  was performed for dn/ds heterogeneity across codons . the discrete model  fitted the data significantly better than the one-ratio model , which suggested the existence of significant variation in selective constraints among codons . further, four lrts were performed for the positively selected codons: m1a/m2a, m7/m <dig>  m8a/m <dig> and m8a/mechanistic empirical model . in order to take the differences between amino-acid replacement rates into account, mec model employed a cprev matrix to expand a  <dig> by  <dig> amino acid replacement rate matrix into a  <dig> by  <dig> sense-codon rate matrix  <cit> . by this means, a position with radical replacements will obtain a higher ka value than a position with more moderate replacements . log-likelihood values and estimates of parameters under various models were given in table  <dig>  and the likelihood ratio tests in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  in dataset two, alternative models , permitting ω >  <dig>  failed to detect positively selected codons and showed non-significance against their null tests . in m2a, though the estimated value  is greater than one, no codon  belongs to this kind of ω; and the estimated value for ω was not greater than  <dig> in m <dig>  meanwhile, m <dig> significantly outperformed m <dig> in both datasets; m2a outperformed m1a as well . collectively, we can conclude three main points under nested maximum likelihood models : 1) subtle positive selection signal was detected in d <dig> protein from fern species; 2) codons within d <dig> protein encoded by duplicated psba genes were mainly under negative selection; 3) several codons encoded by single psba gene might have undergone adaptive evolution.

the random-site models, slac, fel, rel and mec methods were employed to examine the adaptive evolution of the d <dig> protein in eleven fern orders  <cit> . for dataset one , one positively selected codon  has been detected via maximum likelihood methods , none via slac model, one  via fel model , two  via rel model . our results indicate that  <dig> % codons are highly conserved,  <dig> % evolve neutrally, and a few  are positively selected with ω >  <dig> . in the evolution of singleton psba gene, positive selection at a handful of codons has played an important role in the evolutionary dynamics. on the contrary, the majority of codons are under negative selection in dataset two, while a small part is under neutral selection. no positively selected codon was found in the four fern lineages . our results showed that most of the sites are under purifying selection, while a small part is under neutral selection. no sites in the duplicate psba gene were found under positive selection, while  <dig> have statistical significance in the singleton.

the selective relaxation in duplicated psba genes could be observed in the adaptive selection analyses based on single likelihood ancestor counting  and fixed effects likelihood  methods. results in table  <dig> showed a decrease of selective pressure in duplicated psba genes . for instance,  <dig> sites in dataset  <dig> were under selection while only  <dig> in dataset  <dig> via slac . in accordance with fel,  <dig> sites in dataset  <dig> were under selection while only  <dig> in dataset  <dig> . less codons from dataset  <dig> against dataset  <dig> were under either positive or negative selection . on the other hand, no codon was identified as positive selection in dataset  <dig> under rel , while two amino acid sites  were identified in dataset  <dig> 

co-evolutionary pattern among d <dig> protein
multiple amino acid sites were involved in the co-evolutionary network within d <dig> protein. caps indicated that one co-evolution pair was located between the n-terminal and α helix   <cit> . in datamonkey  <cit> , two kinds of methods for detecting co-evolution  indicated that other pair has undergone co-evolution . moreover, the results from intermap3d  <cit>  indicated that ten pairs have undergone coevolution processes during their evolution dynamics .

*three packages were applied in the current researches  <cit> .

***two kinds of molecules  were applied and gave the same pair.

discussion
phylogenetic marker
it is a great challenge to develop dna barcodes for land plants  <cit> . kress and erickson  recommended rbcl gene and psba-trnh spacer region as universal markers  <cit> . our results indicated that the psba and psba-trnh sequences have high resolution at order and family level, but low resolution at several genera level . further investigation with extra locus will have a deeper reflection on this task.

genome rearrangement and psba duplication
the pcr amplification results coincide with the previous conclusion based on the completely and partially sequenced plastomes  <cit> : three kinds of gene order  were found in the  <dig> species from  <dig> fern orders . the data of the extant complete fern cp genomes showed that the trnk-psba-trnh  and matk-psba-trnh  fragments are located in the lsc and the rps7-psba-trnh  fragment is in the irs  <cit> . since the large-scale inversion events involving the duplication of psba gene are rare during the evolution history of fern species  <cit> , one copy of psba exists in those species of trnk-psba-trnh and matk-psba-trnh types and two in rps7-psba-trnh. their full-length psba encoding sequences have not been determined in previous studies.

evolutionary trajectory and survival strategy
the strong competition between ferns and angiosperms for light may have been the main cause for the evolutionary trajectory of psba gene. nevertheless, the occurrence of psba duplication provided an alternative survival strategy versus the molecular adaptive evolution at the codons of d <dig> protein. several positively selected sites were found in single psba gene copy and none in duplicated psba . these results indicated that single psba gene might have functional adaptation via the replacement at certain positions among the d <dig> protein while the duplicated one might have not. conversely to the case of single gene copies, the leptosporangiate ferns with duplicate psba gene may have acquired further fitness gain through the existence of a new transcription locus for the synthesis of d <dig> protein, which might directly increase the efficiency of photosynthesis by protein dosage effects  <cit> .

the structure and function of the d <dig> protein are conserved among cyanobacteria, red algae and plants  <cit> . the purifying selection of psba in lejeuneaceae has been noticed in a recent study  <cit> . regretfully, not like the elegant investigation in rbcl gene  <cit> , the detail function of the codons in d <dig> protein remains obscure. mutation experiments of d <dig> protein will unveil the functional importance of the positively selected positions. moreover, the further research on the relationships between positively selected mutations among psba gene from fern species and the biodiversity will have great impacts on the understanding of fern evolutionary biology.

complicated intra-molecular evolution under selective pressure
eleven co-evolving sites  have been detected via different molecules, and they  may be more important than others in d <dig> protein. point mutation experiments may have distinctive outcomes, some could cause severe functional consequences and others could result in completely undetectable change. this fact indicates that a protein is a network of interacting residues, and the core nodes in this network determine the function of the protein  <cit> . future point mutation experiments aiming at the eleven sites may have butterfly effect on the protein structure and function.

psba gene, along with three other chloroplast genes, encodes the core proteins complex in the chloroplasts of ferns. however, as we have concluded before the functional adaptation of this complex might be caused by the inter-coevolution among different proteins  <cit> . the current intra-molecular evolution analysis may have shortcomings on predicting the complicated coevolutionary networks among the entire functional core complex. further conclusion could not be declared without overall analysis based on the four related genes: psba, psbb, psbc and psbd.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current research we present evidence that point to a complex adaptive process mediating the functional innovation of the d <dig> protein. this process involves a multiply checking of the structural and functional consequences of the fixation of functionally novel mutations and the amelioration of the effects by such mutations may have through compensatory replacement events. a serial amino acid sites are identified as co-evolution positions while significant positive selection signals are detected in the single copy psba gene from the fern species. one hypothetical scenario is put forward: i) single copy psba gene fern species may adapt to the newly formed living circumstance by the modification of amino acids in d <dig> protein; ii) by the meantime, the dosage effects of d <dig> protein are the possible strategy against the rising of angiosperm in psba duplicated ones. the selective relaxation in duplicated psba genes could be observed throughout different models. however, no evidence stands for the functional divergence in the duplicated psba genes. future investigation will shed new lights on this question. although this research covers only a little of the diversity of species in fern, our sampling included all  <dig> orders. our research however opens exciting new avenues that will hopefully lead to a more complete understanding of the functional novelties and dosage effects in the d <dig> protein among ferns.
