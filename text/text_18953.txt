BACKGROUND
since the development of wine-making, wine yeasts have undergone a specific pattern of evolution and have become highly effective in the fermentation of grape juice  <cit> . they are able to withstand various stresses, such as low ph or high levels of ethanol. these yeasts are also resistant to inhibitors, such as sulfites  <cit>  and medium-chain fatty acids  <cit> , and are able to continue fermentation for long periods of nutrients starvation. in addition, commercial wine yeasts make a specific contribution to the aroma bouquet of the wine. knowledge of the genomic bases of these specific features is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptation  <cit> . such knowledge would also provide a basis for the improvement of industrial wine yeast strains  <cit> . various studies have enhanced our understanding of genomic structural variation in wine yeast strains. genome sequencing has led to the identification of genomic rearrangements and mutations specific to wine yeasts . one of the best examples is the translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> described by pérez-ortín et al. <cit>  leading to overexpression of the sulfite exporter gene ssu <dig> and to the resistance of higher levels of sulfite. dunn et al. <cit>  have shown, using comparative genomic hybridization , that copy-number variations for several groups of genes  are also characteristic of wine strains. based on an analysis of the wine yeast ec <dig> sequence, novo et al. <cit>  showed that three loci widely conserved in wine strains had been gained by horizontal transfer events from non saccharomyces yeast  <cit> . comparison of sequenced genomes has suggested that nucleotide polymorphisms are the major source of phenotypic diversity  <cit> . however the relationships between such genetic variations and phenotypic diversity remain unclear, particularly in the context of alcoholic fermentation.

quantitative trait locus -based approaches are widely used in yeast, to link allelic variations to phenotypic diversity  <cit> . this approach has been applied to wine strains to identify the origin of fermentation traits. marullo et al.  <cit>  used this approach to show that mutations of the asparaginase gene asp <dig> underlie differences in acetic acid production between two wine strains. qtl-based approaches have proved efficient for identifying the traits associated with a single mutation, but most fermentation traits are under complex polygenic control which is much more difficult to resolve. using new approaches based on the analysis of very large populations of segregants; extreme qtl mapping ; ehrenreich et al. <cit>  demonstrated the feasibility of identifying the genetic determinants of complex phenotypes, such as drug resistance.

trait variation in may also results from changes in gene expression of the underlying regulatory networks. brem et al. <cit>  have demonstrated that regulatory variations could be linked to genomic alterations by qtl approaches. searches for expression qtls  are now widely used in yeast to decipher regulatory networks variations  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> .

such approaches can be used to elucidate the origin of regulatory network variations and their impact on fermentation traits, such as the fermentation duration, the nitrogen consumption and the metabolite production. we previously generated a segregating population by crossing the lab strain s288c and a spore derivative of the wine yeast ec <dig>  for eqtl linkage analysis  <cit> . one of the main results of this previous study was the detection of a large impact of the abz <dig>  synthase) allele on nitrogen assimilation, resulting in large variations in the fermentation rate  <cit> . furthermore, a recent qtl study using this lineage implicated abz <dig> allele variation in aromatic compounds production  <cit>  probably due to the involvement of this gene in amino-acid metabolisms.

we report here of the results of a new search for fermentation traits qtl and eqtl with an enlarged segregant population in the late stages of alcoholic fermentation, more relevant conditions for addressing the stress response. the use of this approach provided us with a broad view of expression variation in alcoholic fermentation and allowed us to identify the genetic origin of variation for several regulatory networks involved in key processes, such as detoxification and sulfate assimilation. an unexpected result of this study was the finding that fermentation rate was controlled by a partial disomy of chromosome  <dig>  revealing a new role in wine yeasts for a well known translocation.

RESULTS
phenotypics and transcriptomic analysis of the 59a×s288c lineage
we phenotyped  <dig> segregants obtained from a cross between the laboratory strain s288c and the wine yeast derivative 59a . fermentations were performed in a synthetic medium simulating a grape must  and containing para-amino benzoate  to counteract the effect of the abz <dig> allele  <cit> . our analysis were performed in more stringent conditions than that of ambroset et al. <cit> : the amounts of ergosterol and oleic acid used were half those generally used  and fermentations were performed at 24°c. we estimated the kinetic properties regarding the lag time and the fermentation rate at  <dig> stages of the fermentation: rmax  and r <dig> . the fermentation kinetics of parental strains and of several segregants are shown in figure  <dig>  population size and metabolite quantities were determined at the end of the fermentation.

we first checked that phenotypes affected by abz <dig> allele, such as rmax, were corrected by the addition of paba and independent of the allelic form . most of the phenotypes had a high heritability , indicating that genetic variations had a major impact on overall variations. the dry weight was the only phenotype displaying a low heritability  and was disregarded. r <dig> values followed a bimodal distribution, suggesting that the phenotype is mainly controlled by one locus. the other phenotypes, such as rmax and the amounts of metabolites followed continuous distributions, indicating a probable polygenic control .

transcriptome profiles were obtained at 70% of fermentation progress , corresponding to late stationary phase,  <dig> to  <dig> hours after the end of the growth phase . at this point in the fermentation, the yeast is subject to nutrient starvation and ethanol stress . we compared rna abundance between segregants by agilent mono-color labeling and hybridization on oligonuclotides microarrays as described in methods. we identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed between 59a and s288c with a log <dig> of fold-change  of more than  <dig>  in either direction .

we assessed the correlation between the fermentation rate  and gene expression and found large sets of genes positively correlated  and negatively correlated .

clustering analysis revealed a partial disomy of chromosome  <dig> affecting genes expression
a clustering analysis of the whole gene expression dataset revealed significant associations  for  <dig> genes . most of the gene clusters obtained were enriched in functional classes, such as mating, mitochondrial translation, ribosomal proteins, ergosterol synthesis and sulfur assimilation consistent with the known coordination of expression of these genes. some clusters also corresponded to genes correlated with phenotypes . other clusters included physically associated genes .

we identified a cluster of  <dig> genes displaying a higher expression in  <dig> segregants. these genes were physically linked and all were located in the first  <dig> kbp at the start of chromosome  <dig> . a careful mining of the cgh data  revealed that these  <dig> segregants carried a  <dig> kbp duplicated region on the left arm of chromosome  <dig> . no other chromosomal aberration was observed. this partial disomy resulted from the translocation of an arm of chromosome  <dig> onto the chromosome  <dig> originating from the wine yeast strain, in addition to the presence of a standard chromosome  <dig> . this 8– <dig> translocation is known to be responsible for higher level of sulfite resistance and was found in many wine yeasts  <cit> . we examined the impact of this partial disomy on transcriptome profiles by comparing the expression data for the  <dig> disomic segregants with those for the other  <dig> segregants. as expected, the genes of the duplicated region were more strongly expressed in segregants carrying the disomic region , consistent with the doubling of gene copy number. we also observed differences in expression for  <dig> other genes  not located in this area. the upregulated genes include a high proportion of genes involved in methionine biosynthesis  whereas the down-regulated genes included a high proportion of genes involve in the oxidative stress response  and aerobic respiration . the pattern of functional enrichment of the deregulated genes suggests that disomic strains are less affected by stresses of alcoholic fermentation conditions. consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the partial disomy had a major impact on fermentation kinetics . partial disomy was associated with significantly higher fermentation rates, a shorter duration of fermentation  and an absence of sluggish fermentation profiles. levels of acetic acid production were also lower for the disomic segregants , supporting our hypothesis of lower levels of stress in these clones.

phenotypic and expression qtl linkages
we generated a new high-density genetic map  from the affymetrix s <dig> microarrays genotyping data for the  <dig> segregants. linkage analysis was performed by the interval mapping method, for qtls and eqtls.

three phenotypic qtls were identified with a false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig> : one qtl explaining flocculation on chromosome  <dig> encompassing flo <dig>  another explaining clumpiness and encompassing amn <dig> and a third, explaining fermentation rate , on the left arm of the chromosome  <dig> , overlapping with the duplicated region and clearly triggered by the partial disomy. limiting the population to the  <dig> segregants with no partial duplication of chromosome  <dig> eliminated the detection of the r <dig> qtl on chromosome  <dig>  it also led to the detection of three qtls for metabolites levels, mapping to chromosome  <dig>  for pyruvic acid and chromosome  <dig>  for succinic acid and glycerol.

genome wide linkage analysis of gene expression led to the detection of  <dig> eqtls as summarize in table  <dig>  dividing the fdr by two only slightly reduce the number of eqtls, demonstrating the robustness of the data. a high amount  of local-eqtls  were detected with higher average lod than trans-eqtls . some of the genes differentially expressed between the parents displaying cis-eqtls corresponded to genes absent from one of the parental strains. as expected, genes from the three new regions acquired by horizontal transfer in ec <dig>  <cit>  and conserved in 59a formed three clusters , each controlled in cis-regulations. we did not consider these genes, nor the  <dig> genes missing from ec <dig>  <cit>  for subsequent analyses, reducing the number of eqtls to  <dig> 

* average lodscore.

we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes affected by the partial disomy displayed eqtls, and  <dig> of these eqtls mapped to the deleted or duplicated regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  given that the partial disomy could affect the eqtl data, we adapted the analysis  to take this effect into account. two new eqtl linkage analyses were performed as described in figure 3a:  a search with a population limited to  <dig> non disomic segregants   a filtering of the data for the  <dig> disomic segregants, eliminating the markers in the duplicated region and ignoring the  <dig> genes affected by the partial disomy .

these two new data sets were compared with the first one on a venn diagram figure 3b and in additional file  <dig>  most of the eqtls  were common to all the three data sets  and corresponded to eqtls with high lod-score . in analysis  <dig>  restricted to the  <dig> non disomic segregants, the detection power was lower: at lod <dig>  the fdr was  <dig> . data set  <dig> overlapped strongly with data set  <dig>  with  <dig> of  <dig> eqtls common to these two data sets. this suggests that the partial disomy slightly decreased our ability to detect true eqtls, but had only a limited effect on the robustness of the data. the eqtl analysis was performed for the union of the three data sets , taking the “venn” group for each eqtl into account. we, therefore, concluded that we could overcome the effect of the partial disomy.

variations in expression networks are triggered by few loci resulting in the formation of hotspots
the locations of the phenotypic qtls and eqtls are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  many eqtls overlapped in several hotspots and most were common to the three analyses. however, the disomy was responsible for two hotspots on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . furthermore,  <dig> of the eqtls discovered in the two new analyses are overlapping in two hotspots on chromosome  <dig>  at  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp . due to the genetic similarities between ec <dig> and rm11-1a, some phenotypic qtls and eqtls are identical to those previously identified for the cross between by <dig> and rm11-1a .

however, we also found some linkages not previously identified. hotspot  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> was found to be enriched in genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis pathway and is probably controlled by variations of the thi <dig> regulator gene located in the hotspot area. hotspot  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> brings together  <dig> genes with various functions  and grr <dig> seams to be the most relevant candidate gene for the control of this hotspot. it is indeed involved in glucose repression and amino acid sensing  <cit> .

we also found variations in several networks involving fewer genes but potentially involved in the wine-making process. the high-affinity sulfate permease gene, sul <dig>  has a cis-eqtl  overlapping with trans-eqtls for three other genes of the sulfur pathway met <dig>  met <dig> and met <dig>  sul <dig> has two snps in its promoter  and five non-synonymous snps in its coding sequence. changes in sulfate transport efficiency are clearly responsible for the higher expression level of the three other genes involved in sulfur amino-acid metabolism .

similarly, we observed a perturbation of the nitrogen uptake system that might have a significant impact on wine yeast performance  <cit> . the membrane peptide transporter gene, ptr <dig>  and the arginine/alanine aminopeptidase gene, aap <dig>  both have eqtls mapping to cup <dig>  which encodes the known transcriptional repressor of ptr <dig>  cup <dig> has two non-synonymous snps in its coding sequence and the 59a allele clearly increases the expression of ptr <dig> and, probably, also that of aap <dig> . byrd et al. <cit>  described the activation of ptr <dig> by ubiquitin-dependent cup9p degradation in the presence of peptide  <cit> . however, in the 59a strain, ptr <dig> has a frame-shift in its sequence and is, therefore, probably non-functional  <cit> . the involvement of cup <dig> in the control of aap <dig> is consistent with a broader role of this regulator in peptide metabolism. the synthetic must used here did not contain peptides, but these molecules may have been generated by endogenous nitrogen metabolism. the mutation in 59a may act by modulating the repressive activity or degradation of cup9p.

finally, a flocculation qtl was found on chromosome  <dig>  mapping to flo <dig> as previously described  <cit>  . flocculation phenotype was found linked to flo <dig> expression level . surprisingly, multiple qtl searches on the basis of flocculation phenotype did yield a locus containing flo <dig>  however, a second qtl was found on chromosome  <dig>  in a  <dig> kbp region . this region contains the gene oaf <dig> involved in fatty-acid and peroxisome biogenesis. it is possible that oaf <dig> mutations triggered variation of cell surface hydrophobicity that could impact flocculation  <cit> .

variations in detoxification mechanisms are triggered by mutations in transcription factor genes
in this linkage analysis, we detected changes in the detoxification network. several membrane transporters involved in drug export displayed eqtls . some of these genes were under local regulation : svs <dig>  required for resistance to vanadate, the two polyamine exporter, tpo <dig> and tpo <dig>  and the ion transporters alr <dig> and ssu <dig>  the cis-eqtl of ssu <dig> is due to the 8– <dig> translocation. other detoxification system genes  displayed distant control. several eqtls associated variations in the expression of these transporters with variations of zinc-finger transcription factor genes: hap <dig>  pdr <dig>  yrr <dig> and war <dig>

b“self” mean the eqtl is closer than  <dig> kpb to the gene controlled.

the tpo <dig> gene, which displays a cis-eqtl, has three snps in its promoter area and three non synonymous snps in its coding sequence. the s288c allele of tpo <dig> is more strongly expressed than the wine yeast allele. as tpo <dig> is involved in octanoic acid resistance  <cit> , we investigated the effect of variations of tpo <dig> expression on octanoic acid resistance. we measured population growth in the synthetic must medium  supplemented with octanoic acid . octanoic acid resistance dependent principally on the tpo <dig> allele  but was also weakly correlated with tpo <dig> expression level . our data therefore suggest that the form of tpo <dig> encoded by the s288c allele is more effective, conferring a higher octanoic acid resistance.

pdr <dig>  tpo <dig> and qdr <dig> all had an eqtl in hotspot  <dig> mapping to hap <dig> . another gene, pdr <dig>  encoding a pleiotropic drug resistance transcription factor lies in the same locus, 25 kbp away from hap <dig>  and may control some of these genes . consistent with this hypothesis, steyer et al. <cit> , recently showed that high nerolidol production were associated with the s288c allele of pdr <dig>  they demonstrated that qdr <dig> regulation by pdr <dig> accounted the variation of nerolidol release into the medium. we assessed the impact of pdr <dig> allelic variation on gene expression by performing an allelic switch for pdr <dig> and constructed 59a strain expressing the pdr <dig> allele from s288c . we compared the transcriptome of this strain with that of wild type 59a in fermentation conditions . we detected variation of expression for very few genes . qdr <dig> was the gene most strongly upregulated by allelic replacement, with a logfc of  <dig> , consistent with the results of steyer et al. <cit> . among the other targets of pdr <dig>  we only found ylr179c controlled by the allelic form of pdr <dig>  both qdr <dig> and ylr179c had an eqtl mapping to pdr <dig>  in addition to a slight down regulation of pdr <dig> itself, we identified three other genes  as upregulated in the constructed strain and potentially playing a role in detoxification. these genes have not previously been described as pdr8-controlled. we did not detect the targets of pdr <dig> reported by hikkel et al. <cit> . this was probably due to the specific conditions of alcoholic stress and nutrient starvation used in our study. furthermore, we performed an allelic switch with a smaller impact than the over-expression of pdr <dig> used in other studies. finally, only qdr <dig> and ylr179c were controlled by pdr <dig> in hotspot  <dig>  suggesting that expressions of the other genes are triggered by hap <dig> 
pdr <dig> 
allelic switch

the gene paralog of pdr <dig>  yrr <dig>  displays a cis-eqtl on chromosome  <dig> and has four snps in its promoter region and six non-synonymous snps in its coding sequence. sng <dig>  one of the targets of yrr <dig> responsible for nitrosoguanidine resistance  <cit> , has an eqtl mapping to the position of yrr <dig>  surprisingly, we found no linkages of this locus to other yrr <dig> target genes. moreover, the inverse patterns of parental behavior and locus segregation for sng <dig> expression indicates that other loci are involved in sng <dig> control .

the pdr <dig> gene, encoding a plasma membrane abc transporter responsible for organic acid efflux, had an eqtl mapping to its known transcription factor war <dig> , an activator of weak acid stress response. the war <dig> allele of 59a has five non synonymous snps in its coding sequence and was associated with higher levels of pdr <dig> expression level . in addition, war <dig> was itself one of the genes for which expression was affected by hap <dig> variation . the level of war <dig> expression had no significant impact on pdr <dig> transcript abundance. instead pdr <dig> expression levels were influenced by the type of war <dig> allele . pdr <dig> was the only known war1-dependent gene with an eqtl mapping at war <dig>   <cit> . as pdr <dig> has been implicated in sorbic acid resistance  <cit> , we investigated whether variation of the expression of this gene modulated resistance to this acid. we assessed the growth of segregants in the synthetic medium  supplemented with sorbic acid . sorbic acid resistance appeared to be partly controlled by the war <dig> allele  consistent with the effect of war <dig> allele on pdr <dig> expression. we then performed an allelic switch for war <dig> and constructed a 59a strain expressing the war <dig> allele from s288c . the growth profiles of the strains were monitored in the synthetic must medium supplemented with various amount of sorbic acid. the lag phase was longer for 59a war1-s288c than for 59a wild-type . this phenotypic difference was subtler than that observed with a knockout strain, but these results nevertheless confirm that sorbic acid resistance is linked to pdr <dig> expression and to war <dig> genetic variation. variations of detoxification networks may thus be linked to variations of several transcription factor genes. two of these linkages were validated by allelic switch experiments. moreover, we demonstrated that the levels of resistance to octanoic acid and sorbic acid were clearly modulated by these genetic variations.

as polymorphism may result from specific adaptation, we tried to infer the phylogeny of war1p and yrr1p from nucleotidic sequence available for different strains in sgd. interestingly; the two allelic versions  of these two genes diverge from their s. paradoxus orthologue, and are clearly divergent but apparently in a different manner. for war <dig>  s288c and 59a alleles are located on different branches, whereas for yrr <dig>  the phylogeny indicates two clusters one containing palm wine and asian alleles and the second cluster containing 59a wine, rum and bread alleles, as well as s288c alleles. however in this case s288c and 59a are also located on different branches of this cluster . in order to detect if these two genes have evolved neutrally, we performed a mcdonald kreitman test calculating the neutrality index   <cit> . this test was applied to a set of  <dig> war <dig> alleles from strains isolated from various substrates and ni was  <dig>  , indicating a significant excess of non-neutral mutations. as the cluster of asian alleles might inflate this test, we removed the sequence and performed the test again, which indicate a similar result . we performed the similar analysis on yrr <dig> alleles. we obtained ni =  <dig>   for the whole set of alleles and ni =  <dig>   after removal of the asian and palm wine alleles. this suggests that war <dig> and yrr <dig> do not evolve neutrally: these two genes are either subject to the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations that are eliminated by negative selection during speciation, or alternatively they present substantial diversity that might be associated with balanced selection resulting from specific adaptation of the strain to wine fermentation conditions.

discussion
in this study, we developed a genetical genomic approach to get insight into variation of gene regulatory networks during alcoholic fermentation and to assess the impact of this variation on wine yeast properties. we mapped  <dig> eqtls with  <dig> local eqtls and  <dig> distant eqtls . as heritability exceeded 80% for 80% of the transcripts, genetic variations clearly had a major impact on global mrna levels. the differences between the transcripts differentially expressed between the two parental strains and those displaying eqtls confirmed that multigenetic controls are underlying most variations in transcripts abundance. these observations are consistent with the results obtained for other genetical genomic approaches in various organisms  <cit> . we observed several overlaps between phenotypic qtls  and eqtls, consistent with the involvement of regulatory networks variation in yeast trait variations. some of these linkages have been described before , whereas others are probably specific to our conditions or strains. we show that various mechanisms contribute to variations of expression and highlight the role of transcription factors for toxic compound export and the contribution of large chromosomal variations, a partial chromosomal duplication in this case, to the control of fermentation rate.

the transcriptome analysis was performed during the stationary phase in starvation and alcohol stress. therefore our approach was adapted to describe regulatory change associated to this condition. however, variations in regulatory network involved in nitrogen consumption and cell growth were not considered here. for example, expressions of only few genes were found correlated to rmax.

genetic control of fermentation rate
ambroset et al. <cit>  showed that fermentation rate  depended on the paba biosynthesis capacity and abz <dig> allele. by bypassing the effect of abz <dig>  we identified another genetic control of the fermentation rate: the improvement of fermentation kinetics by partial disomy of the left arm of chromosome  <dig>  in the system studied here, this partial disomy was present only in the offspring, due to cross carried out. this link cannot therefore be considered a “real” qtl, but it nevertheless highlights the role of gene copy number variations in the control of a key phenotype  <cit> .

the mechanisms underlying the improvement of fermentation rate associated with this disomy are unclear, however, and will not be easy to decipher, given the size of the chromosomal region and the large number of genes it contains . however, candidate genes may be identified on the basis of their patterns of expression, because the fermentation phenotype is thought to be triggered by a change in expression level. one or several of the  <dig> genes overexpressed in the translocated area may improve tolerance to starvation or, potentially, to alcohol. we investigated the properties of the set of genes in this region of chromosome  <dig> and evaluated their correlation with fermentation rate . we observed that levels of expression of sam <dig> and sam <dig>  involved in s-adenosyl methionine  pool control, were correlated with r <dig>  interestingly, the expression levels of other genes, not located in the duplicated region, involved in sadm synthesis  and involved in methyl transfers  were also correlated with r <dig>  we suspect that sam <dig> and sam <dig> improve of the fermentation rate of the disomic segregants by increasing the availability of sadm. however, the addition of sadm  to the fermentation medium did not improve the fermentation rate of the 59a strain . we previously showed that the methyl donor synthesis and methionine biosynthesis pathways had a strong impact on fermentation rate  <cit> , highlighting the key role of these metabolic pathways in alcoholic fermentation. additional experiments are required to determine the mechanisms underlying this control of fermentation rate.

as this chromosomal amplification increased the fermentation capacity of wine yeasts, we checked for its presence in wild and industrial strain. dunn et al. <cit>  reported a acgh analysis of  <dig> s. cerevisiae strains including  <dig> wine strains. we used their data to search for a partial trisomy  of the left arm of chromosome  <dig>  we detected such partial trisomy in the wine yeast strain nt <dig>  moreover, in their characterization of the s. cerevisiae/s. kudriavzevii triploid hybrid eg <dig>  erny et al. <cit>  detected a major amplification  of the left arm of the s. cerevisiae chromosome  <dig>  the diploid s. cerevisiae strain eg <dig>  which is genetically related to the s. cerevisiae moiety of the eg <dig> genome , also displays trisomy of this region . we determined the form of the chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  present, by pcr for these three strains . the nt <dig> and eg <dig> strains carry three chromosomes  <dig> left arms, originating from two normal chromosomes  <dig> and one copy of chromosome  <dig> carrying the translocation from chromosome  <dig>  the hybrid aneuploid strain eg <dig> carries four left arms of chromosome 16: one from a normal chromosome  <dig> and three from the three chromosomes  <dig>  all carrying the translocation. this findings confirm that amplification of the left arm of chromosome  <dig> occurs in wild/industrial strains. the situation described here suggests a spectacular evolutionary event occurring in two independent steps: a translocation selected due to its effect on sulfite resistance followed by amplification of the chromosomal region concerned, improving fermentation properties.

we evaluated the contribution of the disomy effect to eqtl linkage, by modifying the input dataset. we found that a large set of new eqtls had been masked by the effect of this disomic. most of these eqtls  formed  <dig> hotspots on chromosome  <dig>  several of the genes controlled by these hotspots were found correlated with r <dig>  thus, these loci may partially control fermentation rate, despite the lack of detection of a qtl for this phenotype.

importance of variations in detoxification systems
the analysis of functional enrichment for all eqtls  highlighted a set of  <dig> eqtls linking genetic variation to expression level of genes involved in detoxification. our data show the importance of variations in transcription factor genes and their impact on detoxification systems: pdr <dig>  war <dig> and yrr <dig>  in addition to hap <dig> .

during fermentations, yeast produces toxic compounds that may lead to stuck fermentations  <cit> . this is the case for the medium-chain fatty acids generated as by-products of lipid biosynthesis. pdr <dig> has been shown to be involved in weak organic acid  <cit> , and legras et al. <cit>  have shown that pdr <dig>  together with tpo <dig>  is also a key transporter involved in octanoic acid and decanoic acid resistance. we were able to link genetic variations of tpo <dig> to its expression and to octanoic acid resistance. pdr <dig> has an eqtl in the gene encoding its known transcription factor, war <dig>  that we could link to variations of sorbic acid resistance, but not to octanoic acid resistance, suggesting that the allelic effect of tpo <dig> outweighs the control of medium-chain fatty acid resistance.

for the same population, steyer et al.  <cit>  shown that the allele of pdr <dig> gene controls the export of nerolidol via qdr <dig>  we confirm here that pdr <dig> allelic variation controls the expression of qdr <dig> and ylr179c, the function of which remain unknown. we observed that several drug exporters  were less strongly expressed by the wine form, consistent with the deletions in wine yeasts reported by dunn et al. . the exact physiological role of several of these transporters remains unclear. qdr2p was initially identified as a drug efflux system but its natural targets remain a matter of debate  <cit> . it was subsequently suggested that qdr2p might export amino acids in starvation conditions  <cit> . such a function would be consistent with the lower levels of expression of this gene in wine yeast, given the major effect of nitrogen homeostasis on wine yeasts fermentation capacity.

in addition to the toxic compounds produced by the yeast during fermentation, natural grape musts contain various phenolic compounds  <cit> , which act as key wine preservatives and contribute to aging. stilbene compounds are clearly toxic to fungi, such as s. cerevisiae and aspergillus flavus <cit> . pan et al. <cit>  studied the transcriptomic response to pterostilbene  and show that yrr <dig> and sng <dig> were among the upregulated genes in response to the drug. we identified eqtls for these two genes, which were upregulated by the wine allele of yrr <dig> transcription factor encoding gene.

as the polymorphism observed here may result from specific adaptation to exposure to these compounds, we tried to infer to phylogeny of war1p and yrr1p and evaluate if these genes evolve neutrally. interestingly the mcdonald kreitman test  <cit>  revealed a non neutral evolution for these two genes : this indicates very likely that the substantial diversity observed for war <dig> and yrr <dig> results from balanced selection due to specific adaptation of the strain to wine fermentation conditions. this is consistent with the analysis of steyer et al. <cit> , who reported also a non neutral evolution of pdr <dig> according to the results of a mcdonald test.

unlike yvert et al. <cit> , who reported that distant qtls were not often due to variations of transcription factor genes, we found that most of the variation of detoxification gene expression was linked to transcription factors. surprisingly, variations in these three genes  encoding zinc-finger transcription factors modified the expression of only one or two of their known targets. this may be partly due to the different environment in which pdr <dig> targets have been characterized. we performed our expression analysis in stationary phase under a stressful condition whereas cell growths in rich medium were used for the chip on chip assay of hikkel et al. <cit> . in addition, jothi et al. <cit>  have shown that these transcription factors belong to the lower layer of the hierarchy of the yeast transcription factors network, with direct effects on a limited number of targets. this may make them more tolerant to variation than genes higher up in this hierarchy.

regulatory network variations involved in wine fermentation
in this study, we investigated, for the first time, the expression profiles of the genes present in the three regions introgressed into ec <dig> by horizontal transfer  <cit> . as we worked with a second parental strain devoid of these three regions, we could not identify real eqtls for these genes. we searched for links, using the populations of segregant possessing each region . on chromosome  <dig>  at 145kpb, an eqtl was identified that trigger the expression of the two genes encoding polypeptide transporters  describes by damon et al. <cit> . the new fructose transporter gene, fsy <dig>   <cit>  also had an eqtl on chromosome  <dig>  at 446 kbp . no clear candidate gene was identified in these loci, but our findings could lead to revealing the role of these new genes in fermentation. no phenotypic qtl or trans-eqtl were found in these three regions. more detailed analysis, with a larger set of segregants, should be carried out to assess the variations of expression associated with these regions.

the phenotypic data indicated that most of the traits considered were under multigenic control. this may reflect the large genetic distance between our two parental strains, but marullo et al. <cit>  aslo found, in a study using two commercial wine yeasts and a population of  <dig> segregants, a preponderance of multigenic traits, such as ethanol tolerance and kinetic properties. we were nevertheless able to associate several phenotypic qtls with eqtls. pyruvic acid levels, which were strongly correlated with r <dig>  were linked to a major hotspot on chromosome  <dig>  a candidate gene, sct <dig>  was identified. this gene is involved in lipid desaturation, suggesting that it may act by modulating the plasma membrane stability under alcoholic stress.

however, within the eqtls set, several new linkages are probably involved in the management of the multi-stress conditions in wine fermentation. changes were detected for genes involved in glucose sensing  or thiamine synthesis . functional validations of these results are required, together with further investigations to determine the role of such genetic variation in the adaptation of strains to the wine making process. we also showed that the sulfur amino-acid pathway  was partially enhanced by sul <dig> mutation, probably through effects on sulfate uptake. such activation has not been described before and may reflect the conditions of nitrogen starvation in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed an approach to deciphering the variation of transcriptional networks in yeast, during an industrial wine-making process resulting in multiple stresses. the results obtained were consistent with those of other studies. however, the wine fermentation conditions used here led to the identification of specific variations of regulatory networks not revealed previously in classical laboratory environment. we show that expression variations affect networks of genes involved in various pathways and cellular functions, through diverse mechanisms involving both local and distal regulations and copy number changes driven by chromosomal rearrangements. we focus here on variations of detoxification systems and identified and we confirm the key role of variations in transcription factor genes in modulating the expression of these systems. these results also raise questions about the role of these export systems in fermentation conditions, in which cells are starved and stressed.

the eqtl linkage analysis was generally highly consistent, but most of the phenotype changes were not linked genetic variations and were considered to be under multi-locus control. we found that fermentation rate depended on a gene copy numbers effect of a duplication of the left arm of chromosome  <dig>  this partial disomy was also found in natural yeasts and appears to be a potential new target for yeast optimization for the wine making process.
