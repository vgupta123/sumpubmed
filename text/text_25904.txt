BACKGROUND
ageing is a widespread biological process with a growing impact on medicine and society, but its fundamental causes are still to a large extent unknown. this is particularly true about human ageing. although there has been a significant progress in identifying a large number of ageing-related genes  <cit> ,  <cit> , research in this area up to now has focused mainly on simpler model organisms. a major problem with research on ageing in humans is that it is much more difficult to do experiments, both for obvious ethical reasons and the long experimental time required, and thus shorter-lived models are usually preferred. this problem creates both a need and an opportunity to deploy bioinformatics methods to research human ageing. there is already a large amount of data on this topic in publically available gene/protein databases, but such data is still under-explored. this work aims at filling this gap, proposing a data mining approach to the analysis of ageing-related human genes.

we focused our analysis on dna repair genes, since this is one of the major types of genes often associated with ageing  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . there are more than  <dig> human dna repair genes  <cit> ,  <cit> , which are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity. dna is constantly being damaged by numerous factors - e.g., at physiological temperatures and ph, cytosine bases spontaneously deaminate to uracil bases  <dig> to  <dig> times per day in a typical mammalian cell  <cit> . although mammalian cells have a remarkable dna repair capacity, no repair system is perfect, and dna damage tends to accumulate with time. this accumulation is believed to be a major cause of human ageing  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> .

there are many dna repair genes whose defect or absence has been shown to be associated with ageing in several species, including mice and humans  <cit> ,  <cit> . however, not all defects in dna repair genes result in an accelerated ageing phenotype. for instance, defects in some of those genes can be so serious that the organism dies at an embryonic or perinatal stage, whilst defects in other dna repair genes can lead to cancer. in any case there are a number of dna repair genes that, when defective or absent in an organism, lead to "accelerated ageing" in that organism, the so-called "progeroid syndromes". arguably the most well-known example of such progeroid syndromes is werner's syndrome, caused by a mutation in the wrn gene, which encodes a dna helicase and exonuclease protein. patients with werner's syndrome start to show signs of premature ageing much earlier than usual, when they are young adults, and die at an average age of  <dig>  <cit> .

although many dna repair genes have been associated with mammalian ageing via mutations in patients or genetic manipulations in mice, to the best of our knowledge there has been no systematic study of what are the differences between ageing-related and non-ageing related dna repair genes. the goal of this work is to study these differences in a systematic way, focusing on human dna repair genes, using classification methods from the area of data mining or machine learning  <cit> . classification is a type of supervised learning task where each data instance  in the dataset consists of two parts, a set of predictor attributes and a special class attribute. a classification algorithm builds a classification model that, based on the values of the predictor attributes for a given data instance, predicts what is the class value for that instance.

this paper reports the results of applying two types of classification algorithms - decision tree induction and naive bayes - to a number of different datasets of dna repair genes created specifically for this research. the resulting classification models are then interpreted in light of biological knowledge. to the best of our knowledge, this research is the first application of data mining-based classification methods to the problem of systematically determining gene properties that discriminate between ageing-related and non-ageing related dna repair genes and, considering that the data mining methodology proposed here is generic, it could have other applications in ageing research.

RESULTS
we created datasets where each data instance represents a dna repair gene. each data instance  belongs to a class, either ageing-related or non-ageing related, and is characterized by a set of predictor attributes which encompass properties related to its dna repair pathway, gene ontology  term annotations, protein-protein interaction information, etc - see methods. each dataset is divided into a training dataset and a testing dataset. classification algorithms were used to build, from the training set, classification models that predict the class of an instance  based on the values of predictor attributes. each classification model is then applied to the test set, consisting of data instances unseen during training, in order to measure the predictive accuracy  of that model.

we report computational results for two types of classification algorithms, namely j <dig> and naive bayes . both are implemented in the weka data mining tool  <cit> , which was used in our experiments. we report results for two types of datasets:   <dig> datasets  that use multiple types of predictor attributes but not gene expression attributes;  a dataset including only gene expression attributes . the datasets created in this work have, depending on the criteria used , between  <dig> and  <dig> data instances, out of which  <dig> represent ageing-related dna repair genes and the remaining represent non-ageing-related dna repair genes. all the datasets created and used in this research are available on the web http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/dna_repair.html.

results for datasets with multiple types of attributes but not gene expression attributes
for each classification algorithm, we report its predictive accuracy when mining different datasets produced with three different values of the parameter "go term occurrence threshold", which specifies the minimum number of occurrences in the dataset for a go term to be used as an attribute , namely  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the value  <dig> is a conservative, low value, which avoids the use of rare go terms with very little statistical support and virtually no generalisation power. increasing the threshold value has two opposite effects. on one hand, although the classification algorithms are given a smaller set of attributes , this smaller set has the advantage of including only go terms with a larger occurrence in the dataset, for which the probabilities or related statistics computed by the classification algorithms are more reliable than statistics computed for go terms with fewer occurrences in the dataset. on the other hand, if the threshold value is increased too much, go terms which are relatively rare but still have some predictive power would be lost, which could lead to a decrease in classification accuracy. hence, experiments with different values of this parameter allow us to study the aforementioned trade-off between statistical reliability and availability of relevant attributes for prediction.

we also did experiments with five different datasets produced by varying the set of protein-protein interaction -related attributes. more precisely, dataset d <dig> does not contain any ppi-related attribute. dataset d <dig> contains the numerical #partners  attribute, but not the binary attributes indicating whether or not the current protein interacts with a given protein - referred to as bpi  attributes for short. datasets d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> contain both the #partners attribute and  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  bpi attributes. all datasets included the dna repair pathway and the ka/ki ratio  attributes, as described in the methods.

concerning the effect of different values of the go term occurrence threshold in the predictive accuracy of j <dig>  increasing the value of that threshold to  <dig> or  <dig> had mixed effects. in particular, those increased threshold values led to higher auc values in datasets d <dig> and d <dig>  but lower values in datasets d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  by comparison with the auc values associated with the original threshold value of  <dig>  overall, taking into account all datasets, the best results are achieved with the go term occurrence threshold set to  <dig>  and the best two results in the entire table are achieved for datasets d <dig> and d <dig> with the go term occurrence threshold value of  <dig>  corresponding to auc values of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %, respectively. in any case, the predictive performance of j <dig> was more sensitive to variations in the types of predictor attributes used in the dataset than to variations in the value of the go term occurrence threshold.

the results for naive bayes are reported in table  <dig>  in general, for all three values of the go term occurrence threshold, naive bayes' auc value increased monotonically, from the first row  to the last row , with an increase in the number of ppi-related  attributes. in the case of naive bayes, increasing the value of the go term occurrence threshold to  <dig> or  <dig> led to somewhat lower auc values in four datasets , by comparison with the auc values associated with the original threshold value of  <dig>  however the highest auc value in table  <dig> was achieved with that threshold set to  <dig>  for dataset d <dig> . in summary, varying the value of the go term occurrence threshold had little effect on the predictive accuracy of naive bayes, which is more affected by the types of predictor attributes used in the dataset.

to summarise the distribution of the most relevant attributes selected by j <dig>  table  <dig> shows how many times each attribute was selected to be at the root node  of the decision tree. in table  <dig>  the four attributes with binary values  have their "yes" value associated with ageing - i.e., if the value of that attribute is "yes" for a given dna repair gene, that gene is predicted to be associated with ageing. in the case of the numerical #partners attribute, j <dig> chose the threshold of  <dig> as the best value to discriminate among the two classes, so that in general values of that attribute greater than  <dig> partners tend to be more associated with ageing. this result is consistent with other investigations showing that ageing-related proteins tend to have a higher number of interaction partners than non-ageing-related proteins  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> .

results for datasets with gene expression attributes only
we applied the j <dig> and naive bayes classification algorithms to the dataset of dna repair gene expression values across human tissues extracted from genevestigator . the auc values obtained by these algorithms in this dataset were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these values are much lower than the auc values for the datasets with multiple types of attributes but not gene expression attributes, and they are just slightly higher than the auc value expected from random predictions, which is 50%. hence, the entire classification models built from this data are not reliable. however, analysing the decision tree built by j <dig>  we found a path in the decision tree corresponding to a classification rule which is a good predictor of ageing-related dna repair genes. this rule, which is a modular component of the classification model that can be interpreted independent from the rest of the tree, is as follows:

if  and 

then class = aging_related_dna_repair

the actual gene expression values in the if part of the rule are not easily interpretable, but the rule can be broadly interpreted as: if a dna repair gene has a high expression  in t-lymphocytes and does not have a very high expression in tongue squamous cells, then the gene is predicted to be ageing-related. the main condition in this rule - i.e. the condition which is better at predicting the ageing-related class - is a high expression in t-lymphocytes; the other condition was added to the rule by j <dig> only to make the rule more consistent with respect to the underlying dataset. there are  <dig> dna repair genes satisfying the if part of this rule, and all of them have the class predicted in the then part - i.e. this rule has  <dig> "true positives" and no "false positive". this pattern is highly statistically significant ). the dna repair genes covered by this rule are: apex <dig>  ercc <dig>  rpa <dig>  xrcc <dig> and xrcc <dig> 

we therefore used the ingenuity pathways analysis http://www.ingenuity.com to define crosstalk between genes/proteins involved in the patterns that were discovered via data mining. the network automatically generated by ingenuity is mainly composed of known protein-protein interactions . we also imposed known  links to physiological processes and diseases on the reconstructed network, shown in figure  <dig>  as can be observed in figure  <dig>  xrcc <dig> and xrcc <dig>  have particularly important roles in this network. more precisely, xrcc <dig> is directly connected to all  <dig> aforementioned processes, whilst xrcc <dig> is directly connected to  <dig> of those processes j recombination).

discussion
results for the datasets with multiple types of attributes but not gene expression attributes
one of the advantages of a classification model in the form of a decision tree is that it shows the relevant attributes selected by the algorithm  in a simple and intuitive hierarchical way, where attributes at the top of the tree are more relevant than attributes at the bottom. the attribute at the root node, in particular, is considered the most relevant attribute for classification.

as can be seen in table  <dig>  only two go terms were chosen to be root nodes of a decision tree. both terms refer to response to stimulus, but in both cases the definition of the kind of stimulus in question seems somewhat broad. a simple if-then classification rule that can be extracted from the decision trees, using only the go term "response to endogenous stimulus" at the root node to make a class prediction, is the rule:

if go: <dig>  = yes

then class is aging-related dna repair gene

there are four dna repair genes satisfying the if part of this rule, and all of them belong to the predicted class. this rule is statistically significant ).

another rule that can be extracted from the decision trees is:

if go: <dig>  = yes

and go: <dig>  = yes

and #partners > 15

then class is aging-related dna repair gene

there are  <dig> dna repair genes satisfying the if part of this rule, and all of them belong to its predicted class. this rule is highly statistically significant .

the above two rules indicate that "response to stimulus" is in general a good predictor of ageing-relatedness for dna repair genes. it is worth mentioning that the go term "response to external stimulus" was one of the go terms overrepresented in an ageing-related interaction network of a very different type of gene/protein, namely extracellular proteins  <cit> . this suggests that the relevance of "response to stimulus" for predicting ageing-relatedness is not limited to dna repair genes.

interestingly, the bpi  attributes were chosen to be decision tree root nodes more often than the go term attributes, even though there are much fewer bpi attributes than go term attributes in the datasets. in particular, the wrn_interaction attribute  was chosen as the root attribute in  <dig> out of  <dig> of the experiments where it was input in the dataset used. the wrn protein is associated with werner's syndrome, considered the progeroid syndrome that most presents characteristics of accelerated ageing  <cit> ,  <cit> , and the wrn protein is a hub  in ageing-related protein interaction networks  <cit> ,  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that there is a bias in this result, since the wrn protein and its interaction partners tend to be more studied in the context of ageing than other types of proteins. in fact, in our datasets the wrn protein has  <dig> dna repair interaction partners, all of them belonging to the ageing-related class. therefore, although this pattern is statistically significant, it is not surprising given the biases in the datasets. binary protein interaction data is susceptible to biases related to certain proteins being more studied than others, though apart from wrn we are confident that our results reflect real enrichments.

a more interesting pattern is that interaction with the xrcc <dig>  protein is a strong predictor of the ageing-related class. more precisely, xrcc <dig> was selected  <dig> times as the root node of a decision tree built by j48; and, out of xrcc5's  <dig> dna repair interaction partners,  <dig> are ageing-related dna repair proteins. this pattern is also highly statistically significant .

xrcc <dig> is a dna helicase involved in double-strand-break repair. ku is a heterodimer composed of ku <dig> and ku <dig> subunits. when a double-strand break occurs, ku binds to dna ends and recruits dna-dependent protein kinase subunit, which is believed to phosphorylate and activate downstream targets in the non-homologous end joining  dna repair pathway  <cit> . ku <dig> -/- mice, which are defective in double-strand dna break repair via the nhej pathway, exhibit multiple symptoms of accelerated ageing  <cit> ,  <cit> .

results for the dataset with gene expression attributes only
in this type of dataset, the main pattern discovered was that dna repair genes having a high expression in t lymphocytes tend to be ageing-related genes, and among the genes satisfying this pattern are xrcc <dig> and xrcc <dig>  in addition, as discussed earlier, interaction with xrcc <dig> and wrn are strong predictors of ageing-relatedness for dna repair genes. integrating these patterns, it is interesting to note that wrn, xrcc <dig>  xrcc <dig>  and t lymphocytes are all related to non-homologous end joining , an important pathway for the repair of double-strand dna breaks  <cit> . this process is required for proper telomere maintenance, and nhej is also required for joining hairpin-capped double-strand breaks induced during vj recombination, the process that generates diversity in b-cell and t-cell receptors in the vertebrate immune system  <cit> ,  <cit> .

relations of dna double-strand break frequency with telomere maintenance and ageing have been reported  <cit> ,  <cit> , and the link between ageing and autoimmunity is also striking. increased autoimmunity is observed in down syndrome, which is also characterized by accelerated ageing  <cit> ,  <cit> . autoimmunity was also shown to be associated with the normal ageing process  <cit> ,  <cit>  and many ageing-related diseases  have an autoimmune component in their etiology.

human t lymphocytes represent a well-characterized example of a cell type which retains the ability to up-regulate telomerase as part of their response to a proliferative stimulus  <cit> , and can be long-lived. defects in nhej that would affect other somatic cells and increase their ageing rate will have less effect in the lifespan of t-lymphocytes, but they could target their autoimmune properties. stressing this view we may mention two facts. first, xrcc <dig>  one of the ageing-related genes in our dataset with a high expression in t lymphocytes, is not only a dna repair protein but also a thyroid  <dig> kda autoantigen. second, apex <dig>  is an element in a pathway of response of a target cell to granzyme a, a protease released by cytotoxic t cells and natural killer cells. cleaving the oxidative repair protein ape <dig> enhances cell death mediated by granzyme a  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that these results support connections between a faulty dna repair system and the immune system as one of the factors influencing ageing.

CONCLUSIONS
we have proposed the use of classification algorithms from the area of data mining  to analyse data about dna repair genes associated or not with ageing. for this we created datasets specifically for our data mining purposes, integrating data from several biological databases and websites. in total  <dig> datasets were created, involving distinct combinations of different types of predictor attributes, namely the type of dna repair pathway, a measure of a gene's rate of evolutionary change, a number of attributes referring to biological process go terms , an attribute for the number of proteins interacting with a gene's protein product, a number of attributes referring to interaction with specific proteins , and attributes involving gene expression data. we then built classification models that predict whether a given dna repair gene is ageing-related or not. broadly speaking, the predictor attributes used in this work were better at predicting the ageing-related class than the non-ageing-related class. this may be due to the larger diversity of genes/proteins in the latter class.

in most of the datasets, both j <dig> and naive bayes built classification models with reasonably good predictive accuracy. the two predictor attributes representing the type of dna repair pathway and a measure of a gene's rate of evolutionary change had little predictive power. a set of predictor attributes based on a large number of go terms  had some predictive power. in particular, go terms related to "response to stimulus" turned out to be reasonably good predictors of ageing-relatedness for dna repair genes. however, the predictive accuracies achieved by both algorithms were in general considerably increased when the dataset contained not only go term attributes but also a relatively small set of protein-protein interaction -related attributes . an analysis of the decision trees built by j <dig> for different datasets revealed that, in datasets where both go terms and ppi-related attributes are used, the latter tended to be chosen more often to label the root node of the trees, suggesting their greater relevance for the classification of dna repair genes.

one of the patterns discovered using protein-protein interaction attributes is that, if a dna repair gene's protein product interacts with xrcc <dig> , that gene is likely to be ageing-related. another pattern discovered using gene expression data is that dna repair genes with a high expression in t lymphocytes tend to be ageing-related. among the genes satisfying this latter pattern are xrcc <dig> and xrcc <dig>  genes involved in non-homologous end-joining, an important dna repair pathway for double-strand break repair and also involved in telomere maintenance and the joining of hairpin-capped double-strand breaks induced during vj recombination - the process that generates diversity in b-cell and t-cell receptors in the vertebrate immune system. these patterns and processes have been further integrated in our analysis by using the ingenuity pathways analysis to define crosstalk between genes/proteins involved in the aforementioned patterns and processes.

future research will consist of building classification models based on other types of predictor attributes, e.g. involving information about the domains composing the dna repair proteins being investigated and information about gene essentially  <cit> . in the future it could also be interesting to apply this proposed methodology to the analysis of other types of genes associated with ageing too, e.g. perhaps to discriminate between ageing-related and non-ageing-related genes associated with oxidative stress.
