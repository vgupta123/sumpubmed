BACKGROUND
the high mutation rate of the hepatitis b virus  is responsible for diverse viral mutants that are resistant to antiviral therapies
 <cit> . in addition to single base substitutions, a number of deletion mutations have also been reported. deletion hotspots include precore/core genes, the pres region, and the region of x gene overlapped with basic core promoter 
 <cit> . deletions are believed to be associated with the progression of viral hepatitis. coexistence of wild type hbv , relative to deleted sequences, and mutants with deletions in the c gene has been shown to enhance viral replication, which may be mediated by the coordination of wt and viral strains during encapsidation or reverse transcription
 <cit> . core deletions have frequently been detected before seroconversion to anti-hbe
 <cit> . mutations in codons  <dig> and  <dig> of the x gene, with deletions of nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, were reported to be common in hepatocellular carcinoma  patients
 <cit> . furthermore, pres deletion mutants produce truncated hbv surface proteins ), which accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum . this has been shown to increase er pressure, which promotes the expression of cyclin a and the host apoptosis suppressor cyclooxygenase-2
 <cit> . these findings have raised concerns regarding pres deletions as a risk factor for hepatocarcinogenesis
 <cit> . despite certain complex viral deletion patterns revealed in previous studies
 <cit> , we do not yet fully understand the pattern of these deletions and their correlation to clinical factors.

many deletions interrupt epitopes of viral proteins recognized by t- or b-cells. for instance, the internal deletion around aa 81– <dig> of core antigen damages a t-cell epitope
 <cit> . pres truncations were reported to be associated with the loss of t- and b-epitopes that were able to elicit host protective immune responses
 <cit> . in addition, deletions that disrupt the x gene may lead to low expression of hbcag as observed by the lack of hbc antibody in patients
 <cit> . hence, hbv deletions are speculated to assist viruses in the evasion of immunologic surveillance. additionally, some deletion mutations are more frequently observed in certain clinical conditions. for instance, an nt 1770– <dig> deletion in the x gene of hbv was detected in many serologically non-b and non-c patients
 <cit> . however, most studies only investigate one or two deletion hotspots, thus lacking the complete view of deletion patterns provided by whole genome sequence analyses.

in this study, we describe the distribution of prevailing deletions from  <dig> patient genomes and  <dig> genome fragments with pres deletions obtained in northern china. in particular, we detected significant correlation between pres deletion and antiviral therapy. we also investigated whether pres deletion mutants were resistant to antiviral drugs based on an in vitro assay.

RESULTS
deletion patterns in hbv genomes prevailing in northern china
full-length sequences were obtained from  <dig> patients including  <dig> males and  <dig> females with a mean age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years. among these,  <dig> were genotype b and  <dig> were genotype c .

of these  <dig> samples, genomic deletions were detected in 39% . as shown in figure
1a, the deletions occurred almost exclusively in c, pres, and bcp regions with lengths varying from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, whereas no deletions were observed in the s gene, encoding the small surface protein.
 <cit>  are numbered from n- to c-terminus.

next we analyzed deletion boundaries from all full-length sequences. pres deletions often occur around nt 2848-3215- <dig>  whereas the c gene and bcp region tend to lose nt 2148– <dig> and nt 1758– <dig>  respectively . deletion lengths in the bcp regions appeared consistently in two patterns as either 8-10bp  or 19-21bp .

the influence of deletions on viral proteins and the bcp region
of the three hotspots examined above, most deletions in x/bcp  and the c gene  were frameshift deletions, but almost all deletions in the pres  were in-frame deletions. in addition, the p gene related deletions never occurred at the reverse transcriptase region, which is the target of all nucleoside analogues . the longest deletion  shortened the polymerase by a third and removed most of the spacer and terminal protein domains.

the most significant consequence of sequence deletion is the change of viral epitopes, in the core gene, the majority of deletions altered epitopes of the c <dig> domain  of cytotoxic t lymphocytes  and the b <dig> domain  of b-cells . as shown in figure
1c, the most frequently deleted fragment of bcp also covered nt 1753– <dig> encoding aa 127– <dig> of the x protein, which interrupted previously reported targets of hbxag-specific humoral immune response p <dig>  and c <dig> 
 <cit> . as illustrated in figure
2a, deletions in pres tend to affect t <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> epitopes. interestingly, despite the fact that almost all internal deletions of pres <dig> were localized at the b <dig> epitope , far less truncations were seen in the upstream region where most b- and t-cell epitopes were clustered. the deleted domain in pres <dig> mutations spanned the b <dig> epitope  and a couple of amino acids of the t <dig> epitope , leading to truncated mhbsags. notably, in contrast with a previous study where immunosuppressed patients showed lower pres <dig> deletion frequency, truncated pres <dig> mutants were most frequently observed in patients with pres deletions in our cohort.
 <cit> . known b- and t-cell epitopes in the pres region
 <cit>  are numbered from n- to c-terminus. note the dramatic difference in deletion break points of pres <dig> and the higher deletion frequency at the 5′ terminus of pres <dig> between the two sample groups. the t- and b-cell epitopes of surface proteins are indicated in the bottom panel. b. pres deletion patterns and their frequencies  in hbv prevailing in northern china. sorting of  <dig> mutant clones resulted in four single patterns  and four complex patterns as type i, start codon defect of l protein; type ii, internal deletion of pres1; type iii, start codon defect of m protein; and type iv, internal deletion of pres <dig>  gray bars indicate deletion positions. blunt terminuses illustrate consistent break points and dotted edges display variable ends of deletions. dashed lines show start codons in pres <dig> and pres <dig>  bars in black, right panel: the counts of different deletion patterns.

furthermore, most deletions in bcp occurred in non-coding regions without interrupting the transcription initiation site  of precore mrna. the frequently reported single point mutations at nt  <dig>  and  <dig> , known to affect binding of bcp to liver-specific transcription factors that consequently reduce hbeag expression, were included in most bcp deletions  . however, patients with truncated bcp were actually hbeag-positive, implying the co-existence of wt strains and possible coordination between wt and deletion mutants as evidenced by the existence of ~30% of wt detected during clone sequencing.

substructure of pres deletions
as demonstrated in figure
2a, the length and position of deletions in pres exhibited very diverse patterns. to explore the structural features of these mutations, we further amplified the pres region from a second cohort of  <dig> individuals and  <dig> pres deletions were obtained in clone sequencing. these truncations can be grouped into four categories, including a start codon defect of the l protein , an internal deletion of pres <dig> , a start codon defect of the m protein , an internal deletion of pres <dig> , and complex patterns containing more than one deletion type . among these mutants, internal deletions of pres <dig> were the most common . furthermore, nearly half  of the strains with type i deletions lost the same fragment . also, more than half  of type iii deletions were identical, with a  <dig> bp truncation at nt 3111-3215- <dig> disrupting the t <dig> and b9- <dig> epitopes . particularly, pres <dig> deletions had a variable 5′ terminus and fixed 3′ end .

type i and iii deletions  also interrupted the start codons of surface proteins, leading to abolishment of lhbsag or mhbsag in 53%  and 44%  of cases respectively, with the remaining case  showing a complex deletion pattern, resulting in the loss of both antigens. in addition, we also detected a single base mutation, atg to ata, in pres <dig> from deletion mutants , resulting in the inability to produce m protein instead of making a truncated one. therefore, both substitutions  and deletions  at the start codon led to the total abolishment of m protein production in 30%  of cases.

correlation of deletions with antiviral treatment
next, we investigated a possible correlation between antiviral treatment and deletion patterns and analyzed clinical data of all dominant strains of quasispecies . logistic regression analysis illustrated the relationship between deletions and clinical factors including age, gender, diagnoses, genotypes, hbv dna titers, and antiviral medication. among all clinical factors examined, as summarized in table
 <dig>  only antiviral treatment played a role in the accumulation of deletion mutations . in addition, as shown in table
 <dig>  we did not observe a higher overall deletion rate in advanced liver diseases  as reported by other studies, possibly due to limited cases of hcc.

b, regression coefficient; s.e., standard error; *, p <  <dig> ; or, odds ratio; ci, confidence interval.

further comparison between sample groups also demonstrated that individuals with antiviral therapy showed a higher occurrence of deletions compared to the untreated group . a similar result was seen when the analysis was applied only to chronic carrier  and chronic hepatitis  patients , figure
3) when the possible contribution of mutant accumulation in advanced liver diseases was removed. when stratifying each deletion hotspot by antiviral therapy, bcp deletions were more common in patients with interferon therapy , whereas deletions in pres, particularly in the pres <dig> region, were more likely to be found in cases with nucleotide analog  treatment . in addition, sequencing data of the pres clones from the second batch of  <dig> individuals support the full-length analysis results. of  <dig> ch patients containing pres2-deleted viruses detected by clone sequencing,  <dig> had received na treatment, while  <dig> were treated with interferon-alpha . meanwhile, no significant difference in deletion occurrence was found between different genders  or genotypes . in addition, two out of three pres <dig> deletion mutants in the antiviral group had known antiviral resistance mutations, m204i and l180m, respectively.

dynamic accumulation of pres deletion mutants in hbv quasispecies during adv treatment
the above results suggest that nas may contribute to the accumulation of pres deletion mutants in quasispecies of ch patients. to further verify nas’ selection in this region, we collected blood samples from two ch patients before and after about  <dig> months of adv treatment. serial samples were also collected from additional ch and lc patients, in intervals of  <dig>  months and  <dig> months respectively, with no-antiviral treatment as the control. pcr direct sequencing of the pres region showed heterogeneous indels in the two samples collected after adv treatment, whereas no deletion signal was seen before treatment or in the no-treatment controls. furthermore, clone sequencing was performed in two samples showing heterogeneous indels. as demonstrated in table
 <dig>  quasispecies analysis indicates that about half of the strains contain pres deletions in these two patients.

n, no deletion detected; d, deletion detected.

no antiviral resistance resulted from pres <dig> deletion alone
next, we investigated if deletions alone could directly lead to antiviral resistance. two pres <dig> deletions with high occurrence rates were introduced into the wt strain in a plasmid followed by treatment with lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and tenofovir. as shown in figure
 <dig> and additional file
1: figure s1a-d, both pres2Δ <dig> and pres2Δ <dig> showed similar sensitivity to the wt strain for all four drugs. since the wt strain in the plasmid was genotype d whereas our data were mainly from genotype c strains, we further tested a similar pres <dig> mutant using the genotype c plasmid and obtained the same result . therefore, these pres <dig> deletion mutants alone did not have antiviral resistance.
1: figure s <dig> 

we further compared the replication abilities of these strains in the absence of antiviral drugs, using hbsag as the internal standard. compared to the wt strain , both mutants demonstrated slightly higher replication capacities , however, statistical significance was not reached .

discussion
deletion patterns in the pres region upon host response to viral infection
we analyzed deletions in hbv genomes with respect to deletion hotspots and their boundaries, the correlation of mutations to antiviral medication, and the structural features in pres deletions. we compared pres deletions in our samples with those in immuno-suppressed patients reported by preikschat et al.
 <cit> . similar deletion patterns in c, bcp, and pres <dig> regions were observed and one of the major differences was the deletion frequency in pres <dig> . among all deletions in the entire pres region, truncations in pres <dig> were the most common in our investigation, suggesting that the pres <dig> region may be selectively affected by immune pressure. further studies are needed to clarify the role played by the host immune response in inducing deletions in pres <dig> and pres <dig> genes. another interesting phenomenon is the high rate of deletions in the 5′ terminus of pres <dig> in our samples compared to immune-suppressed subjects as shown in figure
2a. although it does not encode any known epitope, this region spans the host determining region which contributes to the species specificity of hbv
 <cit> . interestingly, genotype d of hbv, which is  <dig> amino acids shorter than that of genotype b, does not contain this region and resembles the 5′ terminus of the pres <dig> deletion mutant
 <cit> .

pres <dig> deletions may promote hbv immune escape after recovery of host immune function following antiviral treatment
deletions have been shown to confer resistance to lamivudine  in an hiv-related study, and certain deletion mutants of hbv were shown to be insensitive to lmv
 <cit> . in our study, we observed the accumulation of pres deletions correlating to antiviral therapy. however, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that the hbv with pres deletion alone did not confer resistance to antiviral therapy in such mutants, similar to a recent observation by ohkawa et al.
 <cit> .

this inconsistency between the epidemiological statistics and in vitro experiments is perhaps not surprising when the most common feature of hbv infection, the existence of quasispecies within an individual, is considered. despite very complex patterns of hbv quasispecies, which were resolved by clone sequencing or high throughput sequencing, we, along with others, have observed that the wild type never disappears from the viral composition. for instance, our recent pyrosequencing study on hbv quasispecies showed that the lowest proportion of the wt strain in patients was around 1% . these data strongly suggest the coordination of wt and various types of mutants which may not survive by themselves alone but whose presence may be beneficial to the viral population in vivo.

such coordination between viral strains may well explain our results. generally speaking, antiviral therapy would also result in the recovery or enhancement of the host defense system, which in turn would increase the selection pressure on mutants, such as pres deletions, that may promote immune escape. supporting evidence also stems from research that suggests an improvement in ctl responsiveness to hbv in ch patients following lmv treatment
 <cit> . in addition, conventional vaccination combined with clevudine could help the host to overcome immunologic tolerance and restore t-cell responses to surface proteins according to the woodchuck model
 <cit> . for instance, viruses with truncated or abolished m protein may survive due to the disruption of their epitopes. interestingly, we observed a much higher frequency of pres <dig> deletions in patients treated with nas compared to long-term immuno-suppressed organ-transplant recipients , suggesting increased immune escape in pres <dig> deletion mutants. in particular, almost all truncated pres <dig> mutants had a damaged b <dig> epitope , a major envelope epitope whose absence would inhibit hbv clearing by the host
 <cit> . therefore, larger sample sizes and detailed functional analysis will be required for further verification. meanwhile, considering the virulent feature of pres deletion mutants in chronic hepatitis infection, development of diagnostic tests for various deletion mutants would be beneficial for ch patients.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized deletion patterns in three hotspots, along the whole hbv genome, that are prevalent in northern china. except for the bcp region, which influences regulating elements of the core gene, most deletions appear to destroy various epitopes of viral proteins. a comparison of samples with or without antiviral medication demonstrated a correlation between na treatment and pres deletions, which is also evidenced by the analysis of serial samples before and after adv treatment. although pres deletions alone had no effect on drug resistance, the accumulation of pres deletion mutants in patients during antiviral treatment may promote viral immune escape.
