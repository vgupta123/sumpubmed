BACKGROUND
the marine diatom pseudo-nitzschia multiseries hasle   produces the neurotoxin domoic acid , which causes amnesic shellfish poisoning 
 <cit> . da is a neuroexcitatory, water-soluble amino acid that exhibits structural similarity with the neurotransmitter glutamate
 <cit> . da binds with high affinity to glutamate receptors, leading to excitation and ultimately cell death of neurons exposed to this toxin
 <cit> . production of da by ps-n, and at least  <dig> other members of the genus pseudo-nitzschia, has been verified in oceanic regions throughout the world, primarily in coastal and upwelling zones
 <cit> . the documented effects of da on humans, birds, finfish, cephalopods, and marine mammals, and the economic costs of shellfishery closures due to da contamination, has generated ongoing interest in understanding the regulation and control of da production in this genus
 <cit> . yet, the biosynthetic pathways leading to da production and the genes that govern these pathways remain unresolved
 <cit> .

numerous studies on ps-n growth dynamics have shown that da production does not begin until early stationary phase, i.e. toxin is not typically produced in detectable amounts during the exponential growth phase . in other studies that exposed ps-n to conditions that slowed cell division during the mid-exponential phase, cells produced low levels of toxin. therefore, toxin production appears to be associated with stages in the cell cycle when cell division has slowed or stopped due to some limiting nutrient factor, most notably silicon 
 <cit> . in addition, several bacterial isolates have been shown to enhance da production by ps-n <cit> . ps-n can produce da in axenic cultures
 <cit> , yet, reintroduction of bacteria to axenic cultures results in increased ps-n da production
 <cit> .

in this study, we developed a ps-n cdna library and used it to construct a microarray in order to screen for genes that were differentially expressed under high-toxin-producing versus low-toxin-producing conditions. a total of  <dig>  ps-n cdnas were printed in replicate, and mrnas from cells that were in late-exponential growth phase were compared to those that were in stationary phase in both axenic and non-axenic cultures. using these array data, we identified candidate reference and target genes for further study. eleven reference genes were evaluated for stability in reverse-transcription quantitative pcr  analyses of ps-n mrna from si-limited cultures. we performed a genorm analysis to validate transcripts that did not vary across conditions. using the validated reference transcripts, we then confirmed the differential regulation of several transcripts whose expression correlates with da production. these findings will facilitate future work aimed at elucidating the da biosynthesis pathway and identifying transcriptional biomarkers indicative of da production.

RESULTS
pseudo-nitzschia growth and toxin production for microarray studies
samples for microarray analysis were obtained from three biological experiments using ps-n strain cl- <dig>  these trials included one axenic and two non-axenic cultures, all grown in standard medium f/ <dig>  da production began at the onset of stationary phase and continued to increase over time in all three experiments . final da concentrations, expressed on a per ml basis, were ~ <dig> times lower in the axenic growth experiment compared to the non-axenic growth experiments, as expected based on previous studies
 <cit> . previous studies also indicated that si is the limiting nutrient for ps-n cells grown in batch cultures with medium f/2
 <cit> ; therefore, we presume that the cells in these experiments were si-limited during stationary phase. samples were harvested for microarray analysis during the late-exponential and stationary phases to compare gene expression between low-toxin-producing vs. high-toxin-producing cells. these time points are indicated by arrows in figure

identification and validation of reference transcripts
our initial goal was the identification of transcripts whose expression levels were stable between late-exponential and stationary phases, which could then be used for normalization of other transcripts’ expression levels under these conditions. we selected eleven candidate reference genes to evaluate in rt-qpcr studies based on their stability in the microarray results as well as their biological roles and use as controls in previous studies . these included transcripts encoding: dynein, histone h <dig>  cyclophilin, ubiquitin, elongation factor  <dig> alpha , phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig> , a jmjc-domain containing protein , an aaa-domain containing atpase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , and 18s rrna. rt-qpcr primer sets for each candidate reference gene were designed and tested, and exhibited high sequence specificity and pcr efficiency under our assay conditions with an annealing temperature of 60°c .

dβ-tubulin was not used in the studies presented as it was not printed on the microarray. it is a validated exon-spanning primer set that demonstrated good efficiency, and may have value as a reference gene for future studies.

to validate the stability of candidate reference genes, biological triplicates of ps-n strain ggb <dig> were grown under non-axenic, si-limited conditions. rna was harvested at multiple time points during the late-exponential and stationary phases . the initiation of da production again corresponded with the onset of stationary phase, which in this study was on day four. initial silicate concentrations were reduced to  <dig>  μm in the culture medium . the measured silicate concentration was below  <dig>  μm by day four , corresponding with the entry into stationary phase. nitrate and phosphate appear to be present in sufficient quantities throughout the experiment 
 <cit> , further supporting that growth of these cultures was si-limited.

in an initial genorm analysis, all eleven candidate genes were tested for stability across a subset of samples from the si-limitation experiment, including replicates from days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the four genes with the best stability values , i.e. jmjc , dynein , histone h <dig>  and cyclophilin , along with ef-1α , were further evaluated for stability using genorm analysis across the complete set of expression data for the si-limitation experiment . all five genes showed acceptable stability  when evaluated across the complete set of data. genorm pairwise-variation analysis determined that only two genes  were necessary for subsequent normalization. however, since the jmjc, dynein, and histone h <dig> genes had equivalent m-values and were matched for 1st rank, we used all three for normalization of the expression data as described below. the expression profiles of the reference genes show the stability of these top-ranked genes, and the slight variability of the ef-1α and cyclophilin genes .

identification and verification of differentially expressed transcripts
in the microarray study, only those transcripts that were up- or down-regulated in all three trials were considered further . higher transcript levels in stationary  as compared to late-exponential  phase were observed for  <dig> transcripts, corresponding to  <dig> cdna clones printed on the ps-n array ; reduced transcript levels under these conditions were observed for six genes, corresponding to  <dig> cdna clones printed on the array . in addition to those genes identified based on the overall false discovery rate , we also included genes predicted to encode glutamate dehydrogenase and fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding protein  in our results, as both were of interest in this study, and the local false discovery rates  indicated valid changes in gene expression. fold-change differences were consistently lower in the axenic growth experiment; however, the patterns of expression were comparable across the three growth experiments.

eight genes were selected for further study using rt-qpcr . of these, six genes had higher transcript levels during the stationary phase , and were predicted to encode a cycloisomerase, an slc <dig> transporter, an aldo-keto reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , and a small heat shock protein. the cycloisomerase, slc <dig> transporter, and aldo-keto reductase genes all had a statistically significant step-wise increase in transcript abundance from days  <dig> to  <dig> that correlated with the gradual increase in da production . the other up-regulated genes showed similar trends during this time period. fcp showed decreased transcript levels during the transition from exponential to stationary phase; the phosphofructokinase  transcript levels, which were down-regulated in the microarray experiment, were not statistically different as measured by rt-qpcr . of note, the absence of dna contamination in these studies is shown visually by the parallel results from amplification of cdna using both standard and exon-exon spanning primer sets for the cyclophilin, slc <dig> transporter, and pfk genes . potential connections between these transcripts and da production are discussed below.

discussion
our data support the validity of the reference genes, jmjc, dynein, and histone h <dig>  as suitable controls for normalization of ps-n mrnas under conditions of si-limitation, as cells transition from late-exponential to stationary phase . multiple reference genes are typically more effective for accurate normalization
 <cit> ; therefore, we recommend the use of the geometric mean of these three reference genes for normalization of ps-n rt-qpcr expression data under these conditions. the stability of a histone h <dig> gene, whose expression often varies with growth phase in other species, may be attributed to regulation at the level of translation vs. transcription
 <cit> . alternatively, the presence of four histone h <dig> homologs in the ps-n genome
 <cit> , as revealed by blast analysis, presents the possibility that we have identified a replication-independent family member, as shown in other studies
 <cit> . of note, our microarray data indicate that the standard “housekeeping” genes, gapdh and actin, may not be suitable reference genes in this experimental system as their transcript levels varied . we tested gapdh for stability in the rt-qpcr genorm analysis, and it showed the least stable m-value of the candidate reference genes tested. similar results were observed in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit> . these results highlight the importance of validating reference genes prior to use for normalization. the primer sets provided in table 
 <dig> should prove useful for examining changes in ps-n gene expression as populations transition from late-exponential to stationary phase, when da production is stimulated, and for testing these candidate genes for use as controls under other growth conditions.

the overall correlation between the array and rt-qpcr data in these studies offers proof of concept for the reliability of these expression data. also, the differential expression of these genes was evidenced in two different ps-n strains, cl- <dig> and ggb <dig>  which were isolated from atlantic and pacific coastal regions, respectively. the down-regulation of an fcp gene during stationary phase, when photosynthesis and chlorophyll presumably decline e.g.
 <cit> , also supports the validity of these results. the down-regulation of fcp gene expression has been correlated with stationary phase and decreases in light-harvesting pigments in the related pennate diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit> , as well as other marine algae
 <cit> . the pathways leading to chlorophyll and da production are both predicted to draw on a pool of glutamate
 <cit> , so the down-regulation of fcp in ps-n correlates well with the onset of da production.

our results provide a framework to further investigate the control of toxin production in ps-n. previous 13c- and 14c-labeling studies suggested a model involving condensation of an activated glutamate intermediate derived from the citric acid cycle with an isoprenoid intermediate, and subsequent cyclization as a mechanism to generate da
 <cit> . these studies allow us to generate hypotheses regarding the biological function of the genes identified in our study relative to da production. for example, up-regulation of a gene encoding a putative ps-n cycloisomerase is intriguing as its product may be directly involved in the proposed cyclization step leading to the pyrrolidine ring in da. alternatively, the cycloisomerase, similar to other enzymes in the related pfam <dig> group, may be involved in converting aromatic compounds into citric acid cycle intermediates, proposed to feed the pathway leading to da synthesis
 <cit> . the identification of a differentially expressed transcript encoding a member of the slc <dig> amino acid transporter family is also interesting. the translated ps-n open reading frame aligns most closely with characterized γ-aminobutyric  neurotransmitter transporters
 <cit> , suggesting the hypothesis that the ps-n transporter is involved in movement of da, or a synthetic precursor, into or out of cells.

our discovery of the up-regulation of a predicted cycloisomerase belonging to the lactonase/lactonizing family, as well as the slc <dig> transporter, entertains the speculation that these gene products are involved in communication between ps-n cells, or ps-n and bacteria. the parallels with gaba in plant signaling pathways
 <cit>  pose a potential role for da in ps-n biology, which has not yet been defined
 <cit> . for example, gaba produced by wounded plant tissues appears to control the lactone quorum-sensing signal in agrobacterium tumefaciens by regulating the a. tumefaciens lactonase gene
 <cit> . bacterial production of lactones in ps-n cultures is correlated with increased da production
 <cit> , suggesting a possible relationship between da and quorum sensing
 <cit> . characterization of the predicted cycloisomerase’s enzymatic properties will be of significant interest in relation to these hypotheses. similarly, demonstration that the slc <dig> transporter is involved in movement of da into or out of the cell would be a valuable contribution to understanding the role of da in ps-n biology. while we have taken the perspective that da may function in signaling pathways, including quorum sensing or pheromone communication
 <cit> , some studies suggest that da may function as a chelating agent
 <cit> . hence, studying the transport of da into and out of ps-n cells directly would contribute to describing the role of da in ps-n biology. a family of four slc <dig> transporters was identified in the recently released ps-n draft genome
 <cit> , so characterization of this entire family should advance our understanding of ps-n biology.

many of the differentially expressed genes in this study relate to general metabolic pathways. therefore, further investigation is needed to resolve the role of these genes in relation to both the growth state and da synthesis in ps-n. for example, the up-regulation of pepck, as well as the potential down-regulation of pfk, suggests a change in energy metabolizing pathways as ps-n cells transition from exponential to stationary phase, consistent with a shift to gluconeogenesis and carbon metabolism through the citric acid cycle
 <cit> . similarly, glutamate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible conversion of glutamate and the citric acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, is a key enzyme involved in nitrogen and energy metabolism
 <cit> . in addition, the differential expression of a predicted acyl-coa synthetase  suggests the possibility that lipids and fatty acids are being broken down, and while this may be a physiological response to growth-limiting conditions, the products could then be channeled as precursors into da synthesis. previous studies have shown that ps-n lipid content decreases in response to si deficiency during stationary phase
 <cit> . acyl-coa synthetases are also involved in amino acid acylation, so could be directly involved in the condensation of the glutamate and isoprenoid-like moieties
 <cit> .

a small heat shock protein gene was most highly up-regulated later in the stationary phase as determined by rt-qpcr, suggestive of its expression relative to physiological stress. the aldo-keto reductase transcript levels showed a step-wise progression from the exponential into the stationary phase, with the highest expression levels later in stationary phase, as well. the expression patterns of these genes may be useful for monitoring the physiological state of ps-n cells. the aldo-keto reductase may also have a functional role in da synthesis, as the labeling studies indicated that the c7’ in da is selectively oxidized to a carboxyl group
 <cit> . several of the genes that were identified as being up-regulated in this study have not been previously characterized from diatoms and represent potential targets for further studies of da synthesis.

the enhancement of da production by co-existing microbes is a complex and fascinating aspect of da biology
 <cit> . a limited number of genes in our study indicated significantly different expression patterns between the non-axenic vs. axenic growth experiments. for example, a subtilisin-like gene, predicted to encode a secreted protease, was up-regulated in the non-axenic cultures relative to the axenic culture . in addition, microbes may influence the metabolic pathways predicted to be involved in fatty acid production. ramsey et al.
 <cit>  suggested that the principal pathway to the isoprenoid portion of da is via an alternative glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate -independent route, and it is interesting to note that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was up-regulated only in the axenic growth experiment , suggesting that bacteria may influence this pathway. future studies will focus on the specific roles that co-existing microbes play in the regulation of ps-n genes and domoic acid production.

the ps-n genome is predicted to include  <dig>  genes
 <cit> ; thus, the estimated  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts monitored via this microarray represent ~20% of the genome. future studies using rna sequencing methods will determine if other transcripts related to those highlighted here are also differentially expressed in correlation with da production.

CONCLUSIONS
our study identified a number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes that provide the basis for future studies on da production, growth state, stress, and amino acid transport in ps-n. the identified transcripts may be particularly useful as early indicators of toxin production and the switch of ps-n cells to an alternative growth state. the reliability of rt-qpcr data will be enhanced by use of the validated internal reference genes presented in this study. to our knowledge, this is the first identification and validation of reference genes for rt-qpcr studies in ps-n.
