BACKGROUND
plant secondary metabolites include more than  <dig>  compounds that display a large chemical diversity while accumulating in specific organs, tissues, and cells  <cit> . they ensure a plant’s survival in the environment by performing a multitude of functions, such as defending plant tissues from pathogens or herbivorous attacks, and aiding reproduction by attracting pollinators or seed dispersers  <cit> . berry fruits accumulate a variety of secondary metabolites such as polyphenols, stilbenoids, carotenoids, and free and bound volatile organic compounds   <cit> . these metabolites affect fruit pigmentation and flavour, and confer to the fruit well-known health benefits. in several fruit crops, the concentration of these metabolites significantly impacts the quality of the fruit and, indeed, the economic value of production. as part of the adaptation mechanism of a plant to its environment, secondary metabolism is sensitive to biotic and abiotic cues  <cit> . hence, in agricultural settings the effect of climatic constraints on the accumulation of these metabolites should be taken into consideration for developing cultivation strategies that optimize fruit composition and crop economic value.

grapes are one of the major fruit crops in the world  <cit> . dry and warm mediterranean climates are considered optimal for wine grape production; in these climates, grapes are often produced without artificial irrigation. however, limited water availability results in reduced vine vigor and fruit growth, significant losses in crop yield, and changes in fruit composition  <cit> . moreover, climate change is predicted to exacerbate drought events in several viticultural areas; and hannah et al.  <cit>  postulate that these phenomena may reduce the viability of viticulture in regions where grapes have been traditionally cultivated.

grapevine berry secondary metabolism is under strong genetic control and varies among cultivars  <cit> . hence, the task of understanding the response of this metabolism to environmental cues is complicated. several studies have investigated the impact of drought and deficit irrigation strategies on berry secondary metabolism in red grape cultivars, focusing specifically on the accumulation of phenolics. recently, hochberg et al.  <cit>  employed large-scale metabolite analyses to investigate the impact of deficit irrigation on this metabolism in cabernet sauvignon and shiraz grapes, and showed cultivar specificity in the magnitude of response. in general, it is recognized that moderate and severe water deficits promote the synthesis and increase the concentration of flavonoids in red grapes, often resulting into better sensory attributes of wines  <cit> . besides phenolics, many other secondary metabolites accumulate in the grape berry. these include carotenoids  <cit>  and free and glycosylated vocs such as c13-norisoprenoids, terpenes, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and alcohols  <cit> . deluc et al.  <cit>  adopted a microarray platform to investigate differences in the transcriptome response to water deficit between cabernet sauvignon, a red grape variety, and chardonnay, a white grape variety. the study revealed that genes of several secondary metabolic pathways were modulated by water deficit and this metabolic response varied with the cultivar considered. in chardonnay grapes, water deficit increased the level of expression of one terpene synthase, indicating that terpenes might be part of the metabolic response to water deficit.

the effect of water deficit on secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored in fruits; particularly, very little information is available on the effect of this deficit on the concentration of vocs, key determinants of fruit economic value, and in the case of wine grapes, of the wine sensory features. recently, large scale transcript and metabolite analyses have been adopted to reveal the metabolic responses of white grapes to cluster exposure to sunlight and to a biotic stress  <cit> . in this case study, we employed a large-scale metabolite profiling and rna-sequencing analyses to evaluate the impact of water deficit on berry secondary metabolism in white grapes in a year characterized by high temperatures and low rainfalls  in a north italian viticultural region where irrigation is rarely applied to the grapevines. we hypothesize that water deficit may activate the terpenoid pathway and the production of monoterpenes. two different water regimes were applied to tocai friulano vines and the effect of water deficit on the transcriptome program and the phenolic, carotenoid, tocopherol, and free voc accumulation were investigated at different stages of berry development. finally, an integrated network analysis was undertaken to investigate the impact of the water deficit on metabolite-metabolite and metabolite-transcript interactions in developing grapes.

RESULTS
impact of irrigation treatments on plant water status, yield, berry growth, berry soluble solids, and titratable acidity
two irrigation treatments were applied to vines during the season. irrigated vines  were weekly irrigated in order to keep their stem water potential  above − <dig>  mpa, whereas vines subjected to deficit irrigation  were not irrigated from fruit set until harvest, unless they displayed signs of extreme water deficit: Ψstem lower than − <dig>  mpa and fading of the canopy.

rainfalls during the  <dig> season were very limited  and mean temperatures peaked just before veraison , which was recorded 65 days after anthesis . Ψstem of d vines decreased from early stages of fruit development  while Ψstem of c vines generally remained above − <dig>  mpa. Ψstem of d vines reached the seasonal minimum  at  <dig> daa. afterward, three consecutive irrigations together with some rainfalls initiated a partial recovery of Ψstem values in d vines.fig.  <dig> weather conditions at the experimental site and impact of irrigation treatments on plant and fruit physiology. a daily rainfall and average temperature. progress of b stem water potential , c berry weight, d soluble solid accumulation, and e titratable acidity in fully irrigated  and deficit irrigated  vines. dotted lines indicate veraison. bars represent ± se. asterisks indicate significant differences between treatments at p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>   evaluated by one-way anova



irrigation treatments significantly affected vine productivity and d reduced both cluster weight and yield per vine . moreover, water deficit severely reduced berry weight in d during most part of the season , produced increased soluble solids  before veraison  and at harvest  , and increased and decreased the concentration of acids before  and after  veraison, respectively, but not at harvest .

impact of water deficit on secondary metabolites and integrated networks of metabolites
berries were sampled for secondary metabolite analyses  six times during the season: three times before ripening , one at the beginning of ripening , one at mid-ripening , and one at late ripening  that coincided with the harvest date of the vineyard. large scale metabolite analysis identified  <dig> phenolics,  <dig> carotenoids,  <dig> tocopherols, and  <dig> vocs. a principal component analysis over the metabolite profiles of the  <dig> samples analyzed  was performed . the analysis indicates that the metabolite profile largely varied based on the berry development, with a sharp distinction between before ripening  and ripening stages , largely driven by the pc <dig>  the irrigation treatment also affected the metabolite profile, with a clear separation of c and d samples at late ripening .

water deficit affected the concentration of  <dig> out of  <dig> phenolics at one or more developmental stages . water deficit generally increased the concentration of derivatives of cinnamic and benzoic acids, and modulated the accumulation of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins. their concentration was increased and decreased by water deficit before  and after  veraison, respectively. limited effects of water deficit on stilbenoid accumulation were observed. in contrast, d largely affected the accumulation of carotenoid and tocopherols in the berry . the concentration of most carotenoids was increased and decreased in d before and after veraison, respectively. zeaxanthin, α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol concentrations were higher in d than in c after veraison. water deficit also increased the concentration of  <dig> vocs  at late ripening . at this stage, d promoted the accumulation of monoterpenes such as hotrienol, linalool, nerol, and α-terpineol.fig.  <dig> effect of water deficit on secondary metabolites during fruit development. heatmaps represent log2fc of the a phenolic, b carotenoid and tocopherol, and c voc concentration under water deficit conditions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> daa. blue and red boxes indicate lower and higher concentration in d, respectively. asterisks indicate significant differences  between treatments. metabolites were hierarchically clustered based on their response to water deficit



differences in metabolic network properties could be observed between c and d  for the phenolic  and voc  networks, but not for the carotenoid and tocopherol ones . water deficit affected the phenolic and voc network topology by increasing the network connectedness in comparison with the controls. in general, the majority of both c and d metabolite-metabolite correlations are based on positive interactions among nodes, but negative correlations were observed especially under d, in particular for gallic acid. we observed two highly interconnected clusters within the voc network of d berries; one of these clusters contained many of the vocs that were significantly modulated under d.fig.  <dig> network representation of phenolics and vocs in c  and d  berries during development. nodes represent ‘metabolites’ and edges represent ‘relationships’ between any two metabolites. edges colored in ‘red’ and ‘blue’ represent positive and negative correlations , respectively. metabolites in bold indicate a significant effect of water deficit on the concentration of that metabolite at one or more developmental stages. number of correlating edges were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in , respectively. the average node neighborhood was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in , respectively. the clustering coefficient was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in , respectively



impact of water deficit on berry transcriptome
to investigate the molecular changes that take place in the berry under water deficit, and to relate these changes to the observed changes in the berry metabolite profile, we compared the transcriptome of c and d berries at three selected developmental stages,  <dig> daa ,  <dig> daa ,  <dig> daa .

after filtering for organelles contamination and quality trimming, the average number of unique reads that mapped the v <dig> version of the grape genome  <cit>  was  <dig>  m . among the  <dig>  genes of the grapevine genome,  <dig>   were expressed at  <dig> daa,  <dig>   at  <dig> daa, and  <dig>   at  <dig> daa. at harvest, the number of expressed genes was significantly higher in d  than in c .

a strong relationship was found between the rna-seq and qpcrs gene expression values of  <dig> genes selected for validating the transcriptomic dataset . coefficient of correlation between rna-seq and qpcr gene expression ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating the reliability of the whole transcriptome assays.

a principal component analysis over the transcriptome profiles of the  <dig> samples analyzed  was performed . the first three principal components explain  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the variance among samples, respectively. similarities and differences among berry transcriptomes were mostly driven by the developmental stage when berries were sampled. c and d samples were mixed within the group of the samples harvested at  <dig> daa, but were clearly separated at  <dig> and  <dig> daa, with the majority of the variance explained by the second principal component.fig.  <dig> analysis of the berry transcriptome in fully irrigated  and deficit irrigated  vines. a principal component analysis  of the berry transcriptome of  <dig> independent samples collected from c and d vines at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa. circles, triangles and squares represent berries at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa, respectively. full and open symbols identify c and d berries, respectively. b common and unique de genes at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa are represented in the venn diagram



the total number of differentially expressed  genes between c and d was  <dig>  . the number of de genes changed during fruit development. d modulated the expression of  <dig>  genes  at  <dig> daa,  <dig>  genes  at  <dig> daa, and  <dig>  genes  at  <dig> daa. some genes were differentially regulated in unison among two or three developmental stages .

seventeen plant go categories  were significantly overrepresented among de genes . before ripening , carbohydrate metabolic process, development, and response to biotic stress were the three major gene ontology  categories within up-regulated genes, while response to stress, transport, and response to abiotic stress were the major go categories within down-regulated genes. at the beginning of ripening , response to stress, carbohydrate, and response to abiotic stress were the three major go categories within up-regulated genes, and response to stress, transport, and development were overrepresented go categories within down-regulated genes. at late ripening , response to stress, development, and response to abiotic stress were the three major go categories within up-regulated genes, and response to stress, transport, and carbohydrate metabolic process were enriched go categories within down-regulated genes. the go category secondary metabolic process was overrepresented within up-regulated genes at all the stages of fruit development considered, and within down-regulated genes at  <dig> daa.

impact of water deficit on phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, carotenoid, and terpenoid pathway
because this study focuses on the impact of water deficit on secondary metabolism, we did identify the de genes that belonged to the major secondary metabolic pathways in the grapevine berry during development . the impact of water deficit on the expression of these genes was expressed as the log <dig> fold change of the transcript level in d compared to c. finally, the genes were mapped into the related metabolic pathways .fig.  <dig> modulation of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathway under water deficit. log2fc  levels of differential gene expression are presented at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  daa. blue and red boxes indicate down- or up-regulation of the gene under water deficit, respectively. bold margins identify significant differences  between treatments. symbols identify commonly regulated steps of the pathway. transcript levels, expressed as normalized counts, in c and d berries at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa, are reported in additional file 13: table s <dig> f

water deficit modulated the expression of many genes that codify for structural enzymes of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathway . most of these genes were up-regulated under d, particularly at  <dig> and  <dig> daa.

among the de genes, three genes annotated as phenylalanine ammonia lyases  were up-regulated by d at  <dig> and  <dig> daa. one trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase  was up-regulated by d at  <dig> and  <dig> daa, while another vvic4h  was down-regulated at  <dig> and up-regulated at  <dig> daa. four 4-coumarate-coa ligase  were up-regulated by d at different developmental stages. other two vvi4cl  were down-regulated at  <dig> daa. one p-coumaroyl shikimate 3'-hydroxylase  and one hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  were up-regulated by d at  <dig> daa. two caffeic acid 3-o-metyltransferase  were up-regulated by d: one  at  <dig> and  <dig> daa, the other one  only at  <dig> daa. finally, a caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferase  was down-regulated at  <dig> and up-regulated at  <dig> daa, while another vviccoamt  was up-regulated at all the three stages of development.

in parallel, water deficit modulated the expression of most structural flavonoid genes; particularly three chalcone synthases , two chalcone isomerases , one flavonoid-3′5′-hydroxylase , two flavanone-3-hydroxylases , one dihydroflavonol reductase , and two leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenases . all the above genes except one vvildox  were up-regulated by d. the flavonol synthase  is a key enzyme for flavonol production. water deficit significantly promoted the expression of one vvifls  at  <dig> and  <dig> daa while down-regulating the expression of another vvifls  at  <dig> daa. the leucoanthocyanidin reductase  and anthocyanidin reductase  are key regulators of the flavan-3-ol and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. vvilar <dig> was up-regulated by water deficit at  <dig> daa, while vvilar <dig> was down-regulated in the same condition at  <dig> daa and up-regulated at  <dig> daa. vvianr was up-regulated by water deficit at  <dig> daa and down-regulated at  <dig> daa.

despite the fact that vvimyb <dig>  and vvimyb <dig> —transcription factors that regulate stilbene synthesis in grapevine  <cit> —were differentially expressed in d at  <dig> daa , transcript levels of the  <dig> annotated vvistss  <cit>  were never affected by water deficit.

the effect of water deficit on the carotenoid pathway was analyzed according to the vitis vinifera carotenoid genes identified by young et al.  <cit> . a phytoene synthase gene  was upregulated under water deficit but only at  <dig> daa . the same was observed for a ζ-carotene desaturase . on the contrary, water deficit down-regulated the expression of a lycopene β-cyclase , a β-carotene hydroxylase , and a carotene hydroxylase  at  <dig> daa, and of a carotenoid isomerase  at  <dig> daa. the expression of a lycopene ε-cyclase  was down-regulated by d at  <dig> and up-regulated at  <dig> daa.

in plants, carotenoids are also the substrate for the production of norisoprenoids. some c13-norisoprenoids, such as β-ionone and β-damascenone, are important determinants of the grape and wine aroma  <cit> . the enzymes   cleavage dioxygenase  and     cleavage dioxygenase  are key enzymes in the norisoprenoid synthesis. in this study, d up-regulated the expression of vviccd4b at  <dig> daa and down-regulated the expression of vviccd4a at  <dig> daa.

plant terpenes are synthesized in the plastids through the 2c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway , and in the cytosol through the mevalonate  pathway. water deficit modulated the expression of several genes of the two pathways . genes regulating early steps of the mep pathway, such as one 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase  and the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase  were down-regulated by d at  <dig> daa, while another vvidxs was down-regulated at  <dig> daa and up-regulated at  <dig> daa. terpene synthases  were generally up-regulated under water deficit, particularly at  <dig> daa. the terpene synthases gene family was recently characterized in vitis vinifera  <cit> . water deficit modulated the expression of seven terpene synthases of the tps-a family , one of the tps-b family , and one of the tps-g family .

the impact of water deficit on the expression of key genes of the phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and terpenoid pathway was then investigated at all the six sampling dates with targeted gene expression analyses . vvipal <dig>  vvichs <dig>  vvifls, and vvianr were up-regulated by water deficit at several developmental stages in parallel with the observed increase of phenolic concentration under the same conditions . similarly, the expression profile of two vvitpss  indicated that water deficit stimulated a higher synthesis of terpenes from  <dig> daa.

impact of water deficit on integrated networks of metabolites and transcripts
the increased average node degree, clustering coefficient, and network density between the c and d metabolite-metabolite networks prompted us to perform an association study between metabolites and transcripts in order to reveal the major transcripts that were associated with changes in metabolite networks . emphasis was given on biosynthetic genes of the metabolite pathways considered. the number of positive correlations between phenolic compounds and phenolic biosynthetic genes slightly increased under d particularly because of an increase in the number of correlations within benzoic and cinnamic acid pathway elements . voc-transcript links were also affected by water deficit. correlations between geraniol, citronellol, and hotrienol levels and terpenoid transcripts were observed in controls only . in contrast, correlations between nerol and α-terpineol levels and terpenoid transcripts were observed only under water deficit . water deficit also modulated the correlations between the non-terpenoid vocs and the fatty acid related transcripts: reducing them for - <dig> -hexadienal and -2-pentenal, and increasing them for nonanal, hexanol, and 3-hexenol. the number of carotenoid-transcript correlations was not affected by water deficit.

the knowledge of the regulation of monoterpene biosynthesis is lacking. because of the remarkable effect of water deficit on the voc networks, we furthered our analysis into gene-metabolite relationship focusing on ripening-related monoterpenes induced by water deficit. these included linalool, nerol, and α-terpineol. the gene-metabolite network included the top  <dig> gene correlators for each of these monoterpenes . among the  <dig> genes present in the network,  <dig> genes  were differentially expressed under water deficit. there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gene-metabolite relationship that were specific for α-terpineol, nerol, and linalool, respectively. inspection of the overall network showed that a large proportion of these correlated genes were involved in terpenoid , lipid , and hormone  metabolism, as well as various transport  and signaling  mechanisms . eleven gene-metabolite interactions were found for all the three metabolites and  <dig> interactions were in common between α-terpineol and nerol. we highlight several potential transcriptional regulators annotated as myb <dig> , c2h <dig> zinc finger , and constans-like  <dig> , which significantly correlated with these monoterpenes. promoter enrichment analysis of the top  <dig> correlated transcripts for each metabolite further revealed that many of the genes within each network contain significantly enriched  myb recognition  and various drought-responsive  motif elements .fig.  <dig> predicted gene-metabolite networks related to linalool , α-terpineol , and nerol  in grapevine berries during development. a genes and metabolites are represented by circle and square nodes respectively. edges represent associations  between transcripts and metabolites. the top  <dig> correlators for each metabolite are shown. node borders in red represent de transcripts. node colors indicate the pathway of the transcripts. b heatmap of cis-regulatory elements enriched  within the networks in a. cis-regulatory elements in bold and underlined are associated with aba/drought response and myb binding, respectively. light and dark red color denotes enrichment scores between  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. white color represents no significant enrichment. *, **, ***, and **** denotes other place cis-regulatory motifs sharing similar consensus sequence with the associated motif 



discussion
the prolonged and severe water deficit imposed in this experiment modulated the accumulation of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, carotenoids, and several vocs in the berry.

at present, little information is available on the effect of water deficit on phenolic accumulation in white grapes. our study indicates that the phenylpropanoid and the flavonoid pathway respond to water deficit at the transcript and metabolite level, and determine a general increase in phenolic concentrations. in red grape cultivars, water deficit strongly promotes accumulation of flavonoids, particularly anthocyanin  <cit> . anthocyanin biosynthesis is limited in white grapes; however, these grapes do accumulate other major flavonoids such as flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and proanthocyanidins. recent studies reported that water deficit increases flavonol concentration  <cit>  and reduces  <cit>  or does not affect proanthocyanidin concentration in grapes  <cit> . water deficit can increase the concentration in the berry of secondary metabolites produced in the skin and in the seed by reducing the berry volume and increasing relative skin and seed masses . this was not the case in this study, since relative skin and seed masses were not affected by water deficit . our gene expression analysis indicated that many phenylpropanoid and flavonoid genes were up-regulated under water deficit, and the modulation of these pathways increased the concentration of derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids and of several flavonoids. interestingly, key structural genes for the flavonol and flavan-3-ol biosynthesis, such as flavonol synthases  and leucoanthocyanidin reductases , were up-regulated at late stages of development, while flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and proanthocyanidin increased in concentration under water deficit only at early stages of development . similarly, in cabernet sauvignon vines exposed to water deficit, vvilar, vvianr, and vvifls were up-regulated after the onset of fruit ripening, but no differences in flavonol and proanthocyanidin concentration were observed  <cit> . our combined transcript and metabolite data suggest that a competition for precursors between enzymes of the flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathways is occurring, with phenylpropanoid enzymes being more efficient in directing the substrates into the production of benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives than the flavonoid enzymes in sequestrating these precursors for the productions of flavonoids, particularly after the onset of fruit ripening when the accumulation of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins decreases dramatically. to this extent, the increase in connectivity  of gallic acid with some flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins observed under water deficit highlights the role of this benzoic acid derivative in the drought response, particularly at late stages of development.

water deficit affected the concentration of carotenoids and tocopherols in the berry, but the modulation of carotenoid genes was much lower than for the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid genes. carotenoids are normally degraded after the onset of fruit ripening  <cit> , and our data indicate that this degradation is increased under water deficit. however, water deficit increased the concentration of zeaxanthin—the only carotenoid synthesized after the onset of berry ripening . zeaxanthin’s role in drought tolerance has been already hypothesized in plants. nerium oleander increased zeaxanthin content in the leaf under water deficit  <cit> , and the enhancement of zeaxanthin levels in the transgenic tobacco lines made plants more tolerant to drought stress  <cit> . as in our work with berries, previous studies have shown a positive correlation between tocopherol accumulation and water deficit in photosynthesizing tissues  <cit> . however, we did not observed a consistent upregulation of key genes of the tocopherol pathway under water deficit and, at late stages of ripening , the gene vvihpt  that encodes for one key enzyme of the pathway was actually down-regulated in d berries , indicating that the accumulation of tocopherols might be affected by post-translational regulation and/or that other unknown genes might be involved in the regulation of this pathway. this result agrees with previous findings in arabidopsis, where wild-type plants subjected to water deficit increased the accumulation of the same tocopherols in the leaves without a parallel modulation of tocopherol biosynthetic genes  <cit> .

the voc profiling indicated that in tocai friulano, vocs are primarily accumulated at early stages of development , but prolonged water deficit can stimulate the accumulation of several vocs at late stages of development. the network analysis revealed that most of the vocs modulated by water deficit mapped in the same network, but only under water deficit conditions. this suggests that water deficit has a major effect on the accumulation of these vocs, regardless the pathway they belong to or the type of accumulation pattern they have under normal conditions. among these vocs, four monoterpenes—key aromatics of several white grapes  <cit> —were largely increased under water deficit, in parallel with an up-regulation of key structural genes of the mep pathway. in particular, key genes for monoterpene production in the grapes such as vvidxs and two vvitpss  <cit>  were up-regulated. the induction of monoterpene production under water deficit has been reported in several plants , including the recent studies in grapevine leaves  <cit> , but the information on the effect of drought on monoterpene biosynthesis in fruits  is lacking  <cit> . besides monoterpene synthases, water deficit also up-regulated seven sesquiterpene synthases  <cit> . we identified only two sesquiterpenes, α-humulene and trans-caryophyllene, which were accumulated in the berry only at early stages and were not affected by water deficit. however, the molecular data indicate that a more detailed profiling of the sesquiterpene accumulated in the berry is necessary to investigate the role of these compounds in the response to water deficit. other key odorants of grapes and wines are the carotenoid degradation products c13-norisoprenoids that were observed to increase in red grapes subjected to a limiting irrigation regime . interestingly, despite the higher degradation of carotenoids observed under water deficit, no clear modulation in the concentration of c13-norisoprenoids, such as β-damascenone and β-ionone, and of β-cyclocitral—a  <dig>  cleavage product of β-carotene  <cit> —was observed.

metabolomic studies coupled with network analysis comparing contrasting genotypes, stress perturbations, and tissues have been useful for understanding the mechanism of genotype—environment interactions of plants  <cit> . deficit irrigation increased the metabolite network connectivity for primary metabolites in grapevine leaf, but the effect was genotype-dependent for phenolic networks  <cit> . network-based analysis conducted here on secondary metabolism revealed that water deficit contributed significantly to restructuring the underlying network properties of fruit metabolites. the higher network connectivity of secondary metabolites observed under water deficit also coincided with the modulation of several genes of the related biosynthetic pathway. it is therefore likely that the observed differential network connectivity between irrigation treatments may be determined by regulation at the transcript level  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, we have observed strong gene-metabolite correlations with phenolic and voc pathway genes. our results also showed that this observation could be extended to other pathways, such as that for terpenoid biosynthesis. the higher number of positive metabolite-transcript correlations for phenolics and terpenoids further strengthens our finding that those metabolic pathways take part of the grape response to water deficit, producing secondary metabolites that potentially enhance grapevine fitness under this abiotic stress.

in grapes, correlation network analysis has been used recently to ascribe functions to candidate genes potentially involved in the regulation of color development  <cit> . ma et al.  <cit>  recently adopted a metabolite-transcript network approach to identify key regulators of the terpenoid pathway in artemisia annua. similarly, we aimed to identify new genes potentially involved in the regulation of terpenoid metabolism during development and under water deficit. the comprehensive metabolite-transcript network constructed with three key monoterpenes whose synthesis was promoted under water deficit showed strong positive association of these metabolites with terpenoid transcripts. interestingly, transcripts related to hormone synthesis  and signaling  were also highly correlated. terpene levels were significantly increased with the application of bth  and methyljasmonate to berries  <cit>  in grapevine. additionally, our analysis allowed us to identify a transcription factor annotated as vvimyb <dig>  as a promising regulatory candidate for monoterpene and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways in grapevine. closer inspection of the annotated myb gene showed high homology towards arabidopsis myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig>  all of which are involved in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . recently myb <dig> was found to be strongly up-regulated under solar uv radiation in grape skins, in parallel with the up-regulation of three terpenoid structural genes  <cit> , suggesting a major role in the grapevine berry response to abiotic factors.

previous studies have shown that terpenoid metabolism responds to light and uv stimuli in berry and leaf tissues , and we discovered that light-responsive motif elements were significantly enriched throughout the monoterpene gene network . this data also indicates that the effects of water limitation on berry terpenes may be indirect, in part owing to changes in the fruit microclimate due to a reduction in canopy density. water deficit can reduce canopy growth determining a higher level of cluster exposure and, by consequence, higher berry temperature  <cit> . the accumulation of grape volatiles can be influenced by light exposure and temperature. indeed, exposure of berries to sunlight favors accumulation of norisoprenoids and monoterpenes, and other free vocs . however, recent studies showed that water deficit and aba treatments significantly increased the monoterpene and sesquiterpene concentration in grapevine leaves  <cit>  even in the absence of uv radiation  <cit> . moreover, the enrichment of drought associated elements  in the promoter region of many up-regulated terpenoid genes observed in our study suggests a major direct modulation of the terpenoid pathway at the transcriptional level, possibly via an aba mediated stimulus. these elements were frequently associated with abiotic stress responses and particularly to drought and aba regulation  <cit> . nevertheless, further tests under more climate-controlled conditions are necessary to reveal to what extent the impact of water deficit on fruit metabolism is due to the modification of berry microclimate.

the stage when deficit is applied and the severity of deficit certainly impact the response of fruit metabolism  <cit> . in grapes it is known that these factors strongly affect the physiological and metabolic response of the berry to water deficit  <cit> . in this case study, large effects on fruit metabolism were observed with drought occurring from early stages of berry development to harvest; a condition that also determined a lower yield and higher berry sugar concentration. however, further investigations that compare water deficit imposed at different timings and at different level of severity should be carried out to fully understand the fruit response to this abiotic stress in white grapes, and how this response is consistent among seasons.

CONCLUSIONS
our study sheds new light into the metabolic mechanisms of fruit response to drought events. recently it was hypothesized that an overproduction of key odorants, such as terpenoids and the carotenoids-derived norisoprenoids, might be part of the adaptation of white grapes to environmental stresses  <cit> . our transcriptome and metabolite analyses showed that, beside the flavonoid pathway, phenylpropanoid and terpenoid pathways can take part in the berry’s response to water deficit in non-pigmented berries; suggesting that an over-production of monoterpenes is part of the fruit response to drought. our network and promoter analyses highlighted a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that encompasses terpenoid genes, transcription factors, and drought-responsive elements enriched in the promoter regions of those genes; this mechanism might be the basis of monoterpenes overproduction. overall, these results indicate that water deficit conditions can potentially impact the quality of white wines by increasing the accumulation of potential antioxidant and flavor compounds  in the grapes. these results are also pivotal to future studies that evaluate the impact of deficit irrigation strategies on wine quality.
