BACKGROUND
culex and aedes mosquitoes are members of the culicinae subfamily that vector positive-sense rna viruses from the family flaviviridae. many flaviviruses, such as west nile virus , dengue virus , and yellow fever virus , are highly pathogenic in humans and pose an important health problem worldwide  <cit> . each year, an estimated  <dig> million human cases of dengue fever occur due to infection with denv. since the introduction of wnv to the united states in  <dig>  over  <dig>  cases have been reported to the cdc, with approximately  <dig>  cases annually http://cdc.gov. culex mosquitoes are primarily responsible for the transmission of wnv to humans , although wnv has also been isolated from aedes albopictus in the eastern united states . virus transmission from cx. quinquefasciatus occurs as early as five days following an infectious blood meal  <cit> , and virus can persist as long as four weeks in the midguts and salivary glands of infected mosquitoes  <cit> .

both culex and aedes mosquitoes are prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. recently, ae. albopictus has emerged as a major vector for chikungunya virus, an alphavirus, in regions bordering the western indian ocean  <cit> . ae. albopictus is also considered a secondary vector for dengue virus serotypes 1- <dig>  and yfv, which are predominantly transmitted to humans by a mosquito from the same genus, ae. aegypti. ae. albopictus can potentially vector at least  <dig> known arboviruses .

of the over  <dig>  mosquito species worldwide, micrornas  have so far only been described in two species of african malaria mosquitoes, anopheles gambiae and anopheles stephensi, using direct cloning and computational methods. over  <dig> mirnas have been described for anopheles mosquitoes, at least  <dig> of which have orthologs in drosophila melanogaster and other insects  <cit> . the functions of these mirnas in mosquitoes, and the identities of their mrna targets, are not yet known.

mirnas are a class of small, non-coding rnas, from 19- <dig> nt in length, that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to complementary regions in, primarily, the 3' untranslated region  of target messenger rnas. first identified in caenorhabditis elegans, mirnas have now been found in a wide variety of organisms including insects, vertebrates, and plants  <cit> . over  <dig>  mirnas are currently annotated in mirbase, many of which are conserved from worms to flies to humans  <cit> . in humans, mirnas are predicted to regulate as much as one-third of all mrnas  <cit> , and thus, represent an important component in managing biological processes.

much of what we understand about insect mirnas comes from studies in the fruit fly d. melanogaster. d. melanogaster mirnas were originally identified via direct cloning of small rna molecules and many of these mirnas exhibited significant sequence conservation with mirnas expressed in c. elegans  <cit> . at present,  <dig> different mirnas have been annotated for d. melanogaster, the majority of which have orthologous sequences in other winged insects  <cit> . with the identification of new mirnas in a number of organisms, evolutionary sequence conservation has become a hallmark of mirna biology  <cit> .

differential mirna expression throughout the various stages of the drosophila life cycle has revealed a role for mirnas in important cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell division, and differentiation  <cit> . additionally, mirna expression profiles change in response to stress, inflammation, and infection  <cit> . for example, in anopheles mosquitoes, expression levels of four mirnas are altered during the response to plasmodium infection  <cit> .

the process of mirna biogenesis is conserved, initiating with the cleavage of long, endogenous nuclear primary mirna transcripts, ranging from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides in length, into pre-mirnas  <cit> . two proteins are required for this processing in insects, the rnase iii enzyme drosha and its binding partner pasha, which together excise the ~ <dig> nt pre-mirna hairpin from the pri-mirna  <cit> . the pre-mirna is then exported to the cytoplasm and processed by a second rnase iii enzyme called dicer- <dig> to yield the ~ <dig> bp mirna:mirna* duplex intermediate  <cit> . mature mirnas are selectively loaded into the multi-component rna-induced silencing complex  which contains members of the argonaute family . in drosophila, strand selection has been shown to depend on the intrinsic structure of the mirna:mirna* duplex, which facilitates sorting into either ago1- or ago2-containing riscs  <cit> . recent comparative genomics studies have shown that the anopheles, aedes, and culex mosquito genomes all encode orthologs of key proteins involved in the mirna, as well as small interfering rna  and piwi rna , regulatory pathways  <cit> . mature mirnas are used as guide rnas to direct risc to complementary regions of mrnas, resulting in the inhibition of translation and/or target mrna degradation. important for this targeting are nucleotides 2- <dig> from the 5' end of the mature mirna, known as the "seed"  <cit> . many studies have shown that mirnas can target 3'utrs of mrnas  <cit> ; however, recent studies have also revealed functional target sites within the orfs of mrnas  <cit> .

recent advances in mosquito genomics, such as the sequencing of the genomes of three mosquito species, ae. aegypti, cx. quinquefasciatus, and an. gambiae  <cit> , together with technological advances in small rna cloning methods, enabled us to interrogate the mirna repertoire in two flavivirus mosquito vectors. in this study, we used deep sequencing to identify over  <dig> conserved and several novel mirnas in cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes and an ae. albopictus cell line, c7/ <dig>  commonly used for in vitro flavivirus studies. we additionally investigated the effects of flavivirus infection on mirna expression and found that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are significantly changed in response to wnv infection.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of small rnas
to identify mirnas in culex and aedes mosquitoes, we isolated small rnas  from c7/ <dig> ae. albopictus cells and blood-fed, female cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. small rna libraries were subjected to illumina-based high-throughput sequencing. after filtering for linker sequences, and removing ambiguous reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads for ae. albopictus cells and  <dig> , <dig> reads for cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, representing  <dig>  and  <dig>  non-redundant sequences, respectively, were obtained . >90% of final reads for ae. albopictus and >50% of reads for cx. quinquefasciatus exhibited the predominantly ~ <dig> nt size expected for insect mirnas .

most mosquito mirnas are orthologs of known insect mirnas
we aligned sequencing reads to known mirnas and mirna* strands present in mirbase v <dig>   <dig> , <dig> reads from the ae. albopictus library corresponded to  <dig> distinct pre-mirnas  . for the cx. quinquefasciatus library,  <dig>  reads aligned to sequences present in mirbase, representing  <dig> distinct pre-mirnas  . for each mirna, the sequence with the greatest number of reads was annotated and named according to the most similar match in mirbase  <cit> . in addition to mature mirnas, we identified a number of mirna* strands , which accounted for <  <dig> % of the 20- <dig> nt population.  <dig> and  <dig> distinct mirna* strands were identified in ae. albopictus and cx. quinquefasciatus respectively, and are orthologous to mirna* strands in other winged insects .

** novel mirnas  recently identified in ae. aegypti mosquitoes while this manuscript was under review

mirna expression levels, based on the number of reads obtained, varied greatly, spanning over five orders of magnitude for cx. quinquefasciatus and six orders of magnitude for ae. albopictus . for both species, the majority of mirnas  were sequenced between  <dig> and  <dig>  times . mir- <dig> was the most highly expressed mirna in both species, represented by  <dig> , <dig> reads in the ae. albopictus library and  <dig>  reads in the cx. quinquefasciatus library. in fact, mir- <dig> dominated the ae. albopictus library, accounting for >95% of all mirna reads. to date, mir- <dig> has been identified in over  <dig> organisms, but has no defined role in insects. surprisingly, although small rnas were prepared from blood-fed whole cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes compared to ae. albopictus c <dig> cells, these two species shared five out of the top ten most frequently occurring mirnas: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> . in drosophila, mir- <dig> has predicted targets in metabolic pathways  <cit>  while mir- <dig> plays a role in wnt signaling  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have no experimentally reported targets to date.

mature mirna species showed sequence lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> nt with a predominance of  <dig> nt and also exhibited strong bias for a 5' uracil  . the presence of a 5' u is a characteristic of many mirnas  <cit> , at least in part, because strand selection of the mirna from the mirna:mirna* duplex is based on the level of thermodynamic stability of the paired ends of the duplex  <cit> .

mosquito mirnas are highly conserved
the ae. albopictus genome is not yet sequenced. since mirna sequences are highly conserved between species, we mapped mirnas cloned from the ae. albopictus cell line to the ae. aegypti genome. interestingly, all ae. albopictus mirnas and mirna* strands mapped with 100% identity to the ae. aegypti genome, indicating evolutionary constraints on not only the mature mirna sequences, but also the pre-mirna hairpins.  <dig> of the  <dig> culex mirna sequences mapped with 100% identity to the cx. quinquefasciatus genome  <cit> . the identified sequence for mir- <dig>  differed by one nucleotide  from the cx. quinquefasciatus genomic sequence. mir- <dig>  occurring  <dig> times in the cx. quinquefasciatus library , exhibited sequence differences at nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> compared to the cx. quinquefasciatus genome. when mapped to the ae. aegypti genome, one nucleotide differed from the genomic sequence. these sequence variations could not be accounted for by mirna editing.

several mirna sequences mapped to multiple locations in the cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti genomes. six cx. quinquefasciatus mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  arise from at least two possible hairpin precursors . in aedes, four mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> arise from two potential hairpin precursors .

with the exception of mir- <dig>  all ae. albopictus mirnas were also identified in cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. additionally,  <dig> mirnas present in cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, but absent from ae. albopictus cells, mapped with 100% sequence identity to the ae. aegypti genome, and are annotated as predicted . of note, cx. quinquefasciatus mir- <dig> was not found in ae. aegypti; however, the annotated mature mirna sequence for an. gambiae mir- <dig> aligns to the ae. aegypti genome with 95% sequence identity. table  <dig> contains the predicted mir- <dig> sequence for ae. aegypti. interestingly, cx. quinquefasciatus mir- <dig> is orthologous not to the mature mir- <dig> in an. gambiae, but to the predicted mir-1174* ; only these  <dig> nucleotides are conserved between the cx. quinquefasciatus and an. gambiae pre-mirnas. in total,  <dig> aedes and cx. quinquefasciatus conserved mirnas were identified, representing over  <dig> seed families .

 <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas identified in cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. albopictus have orthologs in d. melanogaster. in addition to d. melanogaster, we examined orthologous mirna sequences from two other winged insects, an. gambiae and apis mellifera . five mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  have previously been identified in anopheles mosquitoes but, to date, lack orthologs in d. melanogaster or a. mellifera. interestingly, for mir- <dig>  only the mirna sequenced is conserved between anopheles, culex, and aedes, and extensive sequence variations occur in the remaining arm and loop of the precursor. while this manuscript was under review, eight additional novel mosquito-specific mirnas were identified in ae. aegypti mosquitoes  <cit> . mir-2944a/b is present at low levels in cx. quinquefasciatus; mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are present at low levels in both cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes and c <dig> cells . while orthologs of these mosquito-specific mirnas may be identified in other organisms in the future, this group of mirnas appears to be restricted to mosquitoes and hence, may be of more recent evolutionary origin.

sequence variation occurs predominantly at the 3' end of mature mirnas
in each small rna library, reads aligning to a given mature mirna showed some degree of variability. most variability occurred at the 3'ends of each mature mirna, when compared to the 5' ends. figure 2a depicts this variance for all conserved mirnas present in the culex library. each canonical mirna sequence is set at "0"; nucleotide truncations from either the 3' or 5' end are shown by negative numbers, whilst nucleotide additions are shown by positive numbers.  <dig> % of mirna reads exhibited 3' end variability compared to only  <dig> % of reads for 5' variability. in accordance with other mirna studies  <cit> , we found that the majority of mirnas, such as mir- <dig> , followed this pattern of 5' sequence homogeneity and 3' heterogeneity. precision at the mature mirna 5' end has been reported for drosophila mirnas  <cit> . such observations are congruent with the idea that the seed sequence, located within the 5' end of the mirna, is evolutionarily constrained  <cit> .

at least two mirnas, however, did not match this trend. for both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  two dominant mirna species were identified . for mir- <dig>  the most frequently occurring species was sequenced  <dig> times, while the second dominant species, one nucleotide longer with a cytosine at the 5' end, was sequenced  <dig> times. due to variations in the 5' and 3' ends for the remaining  <dig> reads aligning to mir- <dig>  the canonical 5' and 3' ends were actually represented by the second most frequently occurring sequence, which is annotated . interestingly, two dominant forms of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> , one of which contains an extra 5' nucleotide, have been noted for d. melanogaster  <cit> . furthermore, of the  <dig> reads aligning to mir- <dig> in the ae. albopictus library,  <dig>  contain an extra 5' cytosine. only one copy of the mir- <dig> precursor is present in these insect genomes, therefore such differences cannot be attributed to processing from multiple pri-mirnas. mosquitoes and fruit flies diverged over  <dig> million years ago. thus, it is striking that we see these same two forms of mir- <dig> expressed in mosquitoes. our data provide strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that these two forms of mir- <dig> are evolutionarily conserved and are likely to function as at least partly distinct mirnas in vivo.

mir- <dig>  which maps to two loci within the cx. quinquefasciatus genome, but only one locus in each of the ae. aegypti and an. gambiae genomes, also exhibited similar variation at the 5' end . the dominant, canonical mirna species was sequenced  <dig>  times, while the second dominant species, with a 5' cytosine addition, was sequenced  <dig> times. we also observed mir- <dig> variations in the ae. albopictus library. 35% of the  <dig> sequences aligning to ae. albopictus mir- <dig> contained one extra 5' cytosine. the two  <dig> nt pri-mirna stem-loops for cx. quinquefasciatus mir- <dig> are 100% identical, and show 100% and 97% sequence identity with mir- <dig> pri-mirna stem-loops present in the ae. aegypti and an. gambiae genomes, respectively. thus, these variations in the mature mirna sequences, for both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  do not appear to arise from differences in hairpin folding properties, and likely are a result of drosha and/or dicer processing.

the consequences of 5' variation can be severe, since an alteration to the 5' seed creates a new group of potential target mrnas for a mirna  <cit> . depending on the length of the complementary seed match within a target mrna, mirnas arising from a single precursor, yet exhibiting 5' variation, could have both overlapping and distinct targets.

whereas some mirnas exhibited sequence differences at the 5' or 3' ends, we also noted differences in the ratios of mirna:mirna* reads when examining the cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. albopictus libraries. mirna* strands for several mirnas, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and bantam, were sequenced a significant number of times, and thus are annotated with 5p or 3p . in c7/ <dig> cells, mir-1889-3p and mir-1889-5p were expressed at nearly identical levels, suggesting that both strands of the mirna:mirna* duplex are loaded equally into risc as mature mirnas. interestingly, for mir- <dig> in the ae. albopictus library, the ratio of 5p:3p mirna reads was  <dig>  mir-8-5p:  <dig>  mir-8-3p  . in cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, however, the ratio was much different. mir-8-5p occurred only  <dig> times compared to mir-8-3p which occurred  <dig>  times  . of note, the dominant mirna species for ae. albopictus mir-8-3p contains one less 3' nucleotide compared to cx. quinquefasciatus mir-8-3p.

we investigated the predicted mir- <dig> pre-mirna structures in ae. aegypti, cx. quinquefasciatus, and an. gambiae. ae.aegypti mir- <dig> pre-mirna shares 98% and 92% sequence identity with the mir- <dig> pre-mirna in cx. quinquefasciatus and an. gambiae, respectively. intriguingly, all nucleotide differences for mir- <dig> affect only the terminal loop of the pre-mirna hairpin, which alters the pairing at the immediate base of the terminal loop. thus, differences in the mirna-5p:mirna-3p ratios may reflect the rna folding properties of the pre-mirna within each species, which is known to influence strand selection. furthermore, nucleotide diversity in the terminal loop for mir- <dig>  a mirna known to be involved in wnt signaling in the fly  <cit> , may help fine tune not only mirna strand selection but also the mirna sequence itself, thereby also fine tuning mirna target regulation.

whilst the total number of mirna* strands accounted for a low percentage  of mapped reads in each small rna library, some mirna* strands were sequenced more frequently than individual mirna species. for example, in total rna from c7/ <dig> cells, bantam-3p was sequenced  <dig> times, and therefore accounts for a greater percentage of the small rna population than those mature mirnas sequenced less than  <dig> times. likewise, mir-281* in cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes was sequenced  <dig> times, and thus accounts for a greater percentage of small rnas than those occurring less than  <dig> times. importantly, the biological relevance of the mirna* population has been demonstrated in drosophila; mirna* strands can be loaded into ago1-containing risc and target complementary 3' utrs of mrnas  <cit> .

confirmation of mosquito mirnas
we used primer extension analysis to confirm the expression of several of the mirnas represented in our sequencing data. five mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  were sequenced > <dig> times and were readily detectable in total rna isolated from c7/ <dig> cells . five mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were sequenced > <dig> times and were readily detectable in total rna isolated from cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes . in general, the detection level of a given mirna reflected the overall abundance of that mirna in the sequenced library . all mirnas analyzed by this method exhibited the expected sizes.

identification of novel mosquito mirnas
to identify novel mosquito mirnas, we used a combination of mirdeep  <cit>  and mfold  <cit>  to ask whether non-annotated sequences mapping to the mosquito genomes demonstrated folding properties of pre-mirna hairpins. each novel mirna follows both expression and biogenesis criteria set forth for identifying new mirnas, which include  a small rna of appropriate and discrete length ,  arising from one arm of a hairpin precursor,  presence of the star strand, and  evolutionary conservation  <cit> .

four new aedes mirnas  and three new cx. quinquefasciatus mirnas  were identified . each mirna arises from rna structures which fold into canonical pre-mirna hairpins . four of the new mirnas reside on the 5p arms of their respective precursors , while the remaining three mirnas reside on the 3p arms . primer extension analysis confirmed the expression of five of these mirnas .

mir- <dig>  which lacks seed homology to any known mirna, was amongst the most frequently recovered mirnas present in the ae. albopictus library, sequenced  <dig>  times; mir-2940* was sequenced  <dig>  times . interestingly, mir- <dig> and mir-2940* are separated by  <dig> nt of intervening sequence, resulting in a  <dig> nt pre-mirna . this pre-mirna length is unusual for metazoan pre-mirnas, which are normally ~ <dig> nt in length  <cit> . plant pre-mirnas, however, can be as long as  <dig> nt  <cit> , and several drosophila mirnas arise from long hairpins > <dig> nt. the d. melanogaster mir- <dig> precursor, for example, has  <dig> nt of intervening sequence between the mirna and mirna*  <cit> .

two novel aedes mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  arise from pre-mirnas with typical lengths of  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt, respectively . both mirnas were sequenced ~ <dig>  times; however, primer extension analysis suggested that mir- <dig> is expressed at higher levels than mir- <dig> . like mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> shows no seed sequence homology to any known mirna present in mirbase v <dig>  mir- <dig> is 100% identical to cqu-mir- <dig>  expressed in culex mosquitoes .

whilst the majority of new mirnas exhibited discrete lengths, as determined from both sequencing data and primer extension analysis , we observed variations in the 5'ends of both ae. albopictus mir- <dig> and cx. quinquefasciatus mir- <dig>  which affect the seed. 29% of ae. albopictus mir- <dig> reads contained an additional 5' g, while cx. quinquefasciatus mir- <dig> reads contained 5' gg  or 5' g  additions or single nucleotide 5' truncations  compared to the canonical sequence . furthermore, unlike aedes mir-2951*, for which a distinct sequence was identified, over five equally abundant sequences for cx. quinquefasciatus mir-2951* were observed, which affect the positioning of the star strand in the pre-mirna hairpin . only  <dig> nucleotides, excluding the potential 5' seed, are conserved between aedes mir-2951*, and cx. quinquefasciatus mir-2951*, contributing to differences in the predicted pre-mirna hairpin structures. these differences are also due, in part, to nucleotide differences in the terminal loops . these sequence variations might also be attributed to diversity in the flanking pri-mirna sequences; mir- <dig> maps to eight locations within each of the ae. aegypti and cx. quinquefasciatus genomes. notably, within each genome, all pre-mirna loci share 100% sequence identity.

we queried three mosquito genomes  present in vectorbase for the presence of each new mirna. both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have orthologs in an. gambiae . the predicted precursor for mir- <dig> is 93% identical at the sequence level in an. gambiae, while the mature mirna sequence is 100% conserved. interestingly, for mir- <dig>  the orthologous sequence mapping to an. gambiae chromosome x with 95% sequence identity was actually mir-2940*. given that mir-2940* was sequenced over  <dig>  times, it is possible that both strands of the mir-2940:mir-2940* duplex are loaded into risc and function as mature mirnas. notably, the predicted 5p arm for an. gambiae mir- <dig> exhibits the same seed sequence as mir-2940-5p from aedes, suggesting similar functions in mrna targeting . no orthologs for mir- <dig> or mir- <dig> were found in an. gambiae. in fact, mir- <dig> appears to be specific to cx. quinquefasciatus.

two additional mirnas, aae-mir- <dig> and cqu-mir- <dig>  are also orthologs conserved in aedes and cx. quinquefasciatus. cqu-mir- <dig> was readily detectable by primer extension analysis in cx. quinquefasciatus ; however, mir- <dig> was sequenced only nine times in the ae. albopictus library, and thus was below the limit of detection. aae-mir- <dig> and cqu-mir- <dig> each arise from two different pre-mirna hairpins that map to two loci . cqu-mir-2941* strands from both of the cx. quinquefasciatus pre-mirnas were identified , indicating that both hairpins are expressed and processed. the pre-mirnas for both aae-mir- <dig> and cqu-mir- <dig> are clustered within a ~ <dig> nt stretch which, for cx. quinquefasciatus, also includes another novel mirna, mir- <dig> . notably, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> share the first nine 5' nucleotides and thus, have the same seed , suggesting these two mirnas might regulate an overlapping set of target mrnas.

clusters of mosquito mirna genes
the mir- <dig> cluster represents a novel mirna cluster present in both cx. quinquefasciatus and aedes mosquito genomes. to determine whether additional conserved mirnas were clustered, we considered mirnas which mapped to locations within  <dig> kb of each other. nine mosquito mirnas followed this pattern . the ordered distribution of each of the nine pre-mirnas in the ae. aegypti genome was similar to the distribution of pre-mirnas in the cx. quinquefasciatus genome, with two exceptions. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> map to the plus strand in the ae. aegypti genome, but map to the minus strand in cx. quinquefasciatus. it is possible that this cluster is inverted in cx. quinquefasciatus since  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are located on the plus strand in an. gambiae  <cit>  and  the order of mirnas is still conserved. based on sequencing reads, mirnas within each cluster did not appear to be evenly expressed .

culex mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression levels are altered during flavivirus infection
mirnas are known to be important regulators of development. additionally, mirna expression profiles can be altered in response to environmental changes such as stress or infection. four an. gambiae mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  show changes in expression during plasmodium infection  <cit> . given that cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. albopictus are important flavivirus vectors, we asked whether any mirnas were aberrantly expressed during infection with wnv.

we assayed mirna expression in wnv-replicon c7/ <dig> cells and wnv-ny <dig> infected cx. quinquefasciatus using primer extension. persistent infection of c7/ <dig> cells with wnv-replicons had no significant effect on the expression levels of the mirnas assayed . a comparison of blood-fed, uninfected female cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to age- and sex-matched wnv-ny <dig> infected mosquitoes revealed that the majority of mirnas were unaffected; however, we observed  <dig>  fold downregulation of mir- <dig> following wnv-ny <dig> infection . in contrast, mir- <dig> expression was upregulated in wnv-infected cx. quinquefasciatus . notably, this pattern of mirna expression for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> is also found in deep sequencing reads of wnv-infected cx. quinquefasciatus . we also observed changes in mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  among others .

the targets of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in mosquitoes are not yet known; however, several studies have examined expression of these mirnas during development. in an. gambiae, an. stephensi, and ae. aegypti, mir- <dig> expression is restricted to female mosquitoes and found predominantly in the ovaries  <cit> . while this manuscript was in review, li et.al. reported  <dig> deep sequencing of mirnas in ae. aegypti mosquitoes; mir- <dig> is also present in the midgut while mir- <dig> is present in ae. aegypti embryos  <cit> . in the silkworm bombyx mori, mir- <dig> is associated with embryogenesis, a stage of high cellular proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, in vertebrates, mir- <dig> is a member of the conserved mir-17- <dig> cluster and is associated with oncogenesis and increased cellular proliferation. given the dysregulation of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> during wnv infection, it is interesting to speculate that the targets of these mirnas may play roles in mediating flavivirus infection in the mosquito host.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides experimental evidence for over  <dig> conserved and seven novel mirnas present in aedes and cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, and increases our current understanding of insect mirnas. the majority of mirnas identified here demonstrate conventional mirna characteristics including evolutionary conservation, 5' end homogeneity, and an ~ <dig> nt pre-mirna. a small number of mirnas were found that deviate from these standards. cx. quinquefasciatus and aedes mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> are examples of multiple, distinct mirnas arising from one arm of a single hairpin . aedes mir- <dig>  among others, arises from an unusually long pre-mirna . additionally, the prevalence of the mirna* strand for several mirnas, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and bantam, expands the potential of mirna regulation in an organism by adding to the number of possible mirna seeds and thus adding new mrna targets. finally, of the novel mirnas identified here, four currently lack orthologs in non-mosquito species, bringing the total mosquito-specific mirnas to  <dig>  <cit> .

aedes and culex mosquitoes are major arbovirus vectors, important in transmitting both alphaviruses and flaviviruses to humans. we found mir- <dig>  a female-specific mirna in anopheles and aedes mosquitoes, to be downregulated in wnv-infected cx. quinquefasciatus while mir- <dig> is significantly upregulated. this is the first report of mirna dysregulation following flavivirus infection of a natural mosquito host. future research will elucidate the functions of these newly identified mirnas in mosquito biology. undoubtedly, some of the mirnas identified here will have roles not only in mosquito development, like their drosophila counterparts, but also in mediating viral infection in the mosquito host.
