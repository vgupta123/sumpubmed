BACKGROUND
plant micrornas  are a class of small, single-stranded rnas that regulate gene expression by promoting cleavage or translation inhibition of the cognate mrnas  <cit> . the majority of identified mirnas have been shown to be evolutionarily conserved among a wide variety of plant species  <cit> . these short  mirna molecules are formed in a multistep process that takes place in the nucleus and involves several specific proteins. microrna genes are transcribed by the rna polymerase ii. long primary transcripts , with mirna and mirna* in the stem of hairpin structure, are processed by a multi-protein complex into the shorter precursor forms containing stem and loop structure   <cit> . the conversion of pri-mirna to the pre-mirna requires dicer like  <dig>  rnase activity. the dcl <dig> interacts with the hyponastic leaves  <dig>  protein, binding the double stranded rna  <cit> . furthermore, the dcl <dig> acts with the serrate  protein that in turn binds to cap binding complex , formed of the cap binding protein  <dig>  and the cap binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . the dawdle  protein stabilizes the pri-mirna and facilitates its conversion to the pre-mirna  <cit> . recent studies have shown that additional proteins are also essential in the pri-mirna processing, specifically the tough  protein which interact with the dcl <dig> and hyl <dig> protein  <cit> , and the sicle  protein acting with hyl <dig> protein  <cit> . it is also known that c-terminal domain phosphatase-like  <dig>  protein is necessary for the hyl <dig> dephosphorylation and conditioning its role in the mirna biogenesis  <cit> . additionally, stabilized  <dig> , an arabidopsis pre-mrna processing factor  <dig> homolog, is a new potential molecule involved in mirna biogenesis  <cit> . pre-mirna is further cleaved by dcl <dig> to a double stranded rna formed by mirna and mirna*. this duplex contains two nucleotide overhangs at their 3′ ends, which are further methylated by hua enhancer  <dig>  methyltransferase  <cit> . methylated dsrna is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by hasty  exportin, an ortholog of exportin  <dig> in animals  <cit> . in the cytoplasm, mirna:mirna* duplex is loaded on the risc  and then mirna* is degraded  <cit> . the mirna-guided risc binds to target mrna and directs its cleavage or translation inhibition  <cit> , resulting in the down-regulation of this targeted gene expression. in this manner, mirnas control crucial processes like plant development, organ formation, flowering timing and nutrient homeostasis. they also regulate response to the oxidative and salt stress, water deficit, cold, uv radiation and many biotic stresses  <cit> .

due to the important functions of the mirnas and the recent advances of experimental and computational analytical approaches, interest in these small molecules has increased significantly in recent years. to date, there are  <dig> mature mirna sequences from  <dig> different species  collected in the mirbase database   <cit> . in contrast, the plant microrna database   <cit>  contains  <dig> mirnas identified in  <dig> plants. a great contributor to the amount of recently discovered mirnas has been the development of high-throughput sequencing methods such as the roche  <dig> life sciences system, illumina genome analyzer and applied biosystems solid system  <cit> . these technologies have been used in many studies to identify and determine the expression levels of mirnas that are, for example, conserved, novel, tissue- or developmental stage-specific  <cit> . experimental mirna analyses are often supplemented by bioinformatic methods, which are used to process raw sequencing data, predict mirna genes, precursors, mature sequences and targets, identify isoforms, and classify small rnas into known mirna families  <cit> . these experimental and computational methods not only allow for low-cost quantitative and qualitative small rnas analysis but also generate more specific results in shorter time frame  <cit> .

among food crops, brassica oleracea l. is an important and large group of vegetable subspecies, which include the cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprout, kohlrabi, cauliflower, and kale. these plants have gained a special place in the human diet because of their nutritional benefits and the fact that as a food reserves can be stored in winter. cabbage, as an example, is a great source of fiber, vitamin c, carotenoids, minerals, lupeol and glucosinolates, which have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties  <cit> . the b. oleracea crops are diploids that belong to the brassica genus. their cc genome, containing two copies of  <dig> chromosomes , is still incomplete. to date, there are  <dig> potential b. oleracea mirna candidates, the majority of which were obtained from a comparative genome-based computational analysis  <cit>  or blast search  <cit> . given the economic and nutritional importance of these vegetables in many countries, the identification and validation of all mirnas in one of the b. oleracea subspecies – cabbage, is extremely important for biological-cognitive, agricultural and health reasons.

in the present study, for the first time, small rna sequencing using the illumina method was performed to identify novel and conserved mirnas in cabbage leaves. a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified, including  <dig> molecules that are conserved among plants and  <dig> that are novel candidates. the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were validated by northern blot hybridization. furthermore, the best potential targets for all b. oleracea mirnas were collected. in addition, the trans-acting sirnas prediction was performed, which resulted in proposal of  <dig> tasirnas from  <dig> tas loci, including the identified a. thaliana tas3a homologue. to determine the functions of the discovered mirnas and the processes which they potentially regulate in cabbage leaves, the go annotation, go enrichment analysis and kegg  pathway mapping of predicted targets were performed.

RESULTS
analysis of the small rna tags
after illumina sequencing of three small rna libraries, a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads were generated. the removal of low-quality tags and contaminants, and further reads clustering resulted in sets of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> unique sequences, respectively. the examination of their length distribution showed that most of the generated reads had  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides , which are also the most frequent sizes of the known brassica plant mirnas  <cit> . in the next step, the b. oleracea sequences of  <dig> trnas,  <dig> rrnas,  <dig> snorna and  <dig> repeat-associated rnas were downloaded and matched to the unique tags to remove ncrnas from the reads collection. the respective exclusion of 2054/2122/ <dig> rrnas, 1350/2846/ <dig> trnas, 5/5/ <dig> snornas and 5734/5475/ <dig> repeat-associated rnas reads reduced the data sets to 5857295/6129135/ <dig> sequences. to eliminate mrna degradation products, the gss and est sequences were first assembled with the cap <dig> program. a further comparison of the generated  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons to the nr  database provided a collection of the b. oleracea protein-coding sequences. the obtained data, together with  <dig> cds  sequences, served as the reference set in a blastn search, which resulted in the removal of 7311/5406/ <dig> tags, respectively, having a high probability of being part of exons. the remaining reads were then used in the homology search for known b. oleracea mirnas.

due to the lack of a complete b. oleracea genome, the filtering steps of this bioinformatic analysis were repeated using the b. rapa and a. thaliana sequences. from the genbank and rfam database,  <dig> trnas,  <dig> rrnas,  <dig> snornas,  <dig> snrnas and  <dig> scrnas were obtained and aligned with the unannotated tags, resulting in the respective elimination of 686/1267/ <dig>  5374/6080/ <dig>  788/776/ <dig>  2998/3697/ <dig> and 131/123/ <dig> reads. the remaining tags were then searched to exclude 8014/9227/ <dig> sequences, showing high similarity to some repeat-associated rnas and 221750/156305/ <dig> tags which were most likely part of cds’s; thus, resulting in the final sets of 5610243/5946254/ <dig> unannotated unique reads. detailed information about the number of eliminated tags, representing different types of rna sequences, is summarized in table  <dig>

identification of conserved mirnas in cabbage leaves
as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the unannotated reads were used in a blastn search against a collection of  <dig> b. oleracea mirnas, which were obtained from the pmrd database and the wang et al. study  <cit> . identical sequences or those with one gap/mismatch outside the “seed” region  were selected and clustered into known mirna families. a similar analysis was performed for the unannotated tags that remained after filtering out the a. thaliana and b. rapa ncrnas, exons and repeat-associated rnas. however in this case, exactly  <dig> known mirnas from  <dig> different plant species  served as a reference set and only blastn alignments with no more than  <dig> mismatches/gaps outside the “seed” region were selected.

performed analysis of high-throughput sequencing data confirmed the presence of  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> mirna families in the cabbage leaves. after the sequence similarity search,  <dig> of the b. oleracea mirnas that were collected in the pmrd database and  <dig> from  <dig> mirnas candidates presented in the wang et al. study  <cit>  were successfully identified in all three libraries. the most likely explanation for the lack of the remaining known b. oleracea mirnas in generated data sets is their absence or low expression level in the mature cabbage leaves. in addition to the mentioned b. oleracea molecules, homologues of the  <dig> known mirnas from other plant species were discovered. among the identified mirna families, which most of them were shown to be abundant in plants closely related to the brassicaceae, the mir <dig> contained the highest number of members . the less numerous were the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families, represented by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively . the relative abundances of discovered cabbage mirnas were estimated by the mean values of the normalized number of mirna tags in all three libraries. the following molecules had the highest abundance level: bol-mir167a , bol-mir166a , bol-mir157a , bol-mir168c , bol-mir172a , and bol-mir156c  . the presented results are consistent with high-throughput sequencing studies of small rnas from plants such as the brassica rapa <cit> , poncrius trifoliata <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . among the sequences obtained from cabbage reads analysis, the antisense mirnas  were also present. because mirnas* are usually quickly degraded after mirna:mirna* duplex processing, these antisense sequences can be rarely found in conventional sequencing results. their existence, however, may indicate the abundance of mature mirnas or important functionality of both particles  <cit> . in the analyzed results,  <dig> mirnas* belonging to  <dig> families were identified. in general, their expression levels were relatively low; nevertheless, the highest levels were shown by bol-mir162c* , bol-mir162b* , bol-mir157a* , bol-mir160a* , and the bol-mir172b* . these molecules also represent antisense sequences of the most abundant mirna species .

discovery of novel b. oleracea mirnas
to designate novel cabbage mirnas, approximately  <dig> unannotated unique sequences were mapped to the b. oleracea contigs and singletons and to the a. thaliana and b. rapa genomes. the 2412302/2418729/ <dig> perfectly or near perfectly matched tags were then used in the mireap method to predict pre-mirnas. the minimum folding energy  of the obtained 2562/1449/ <dig> hairpin precursors was evaluated with the unafold program. the remaining sequences with mfes less than -18 kcal/mol, were analyzed by the novomir and huntmi software to exclude pseudo pre-mirnas and discard precursors not classified as typical for the a. thaliana. to further improve the quality of the predicted molecules, the selected stem-loop structures, in the final stage of described analysis, were evaluated manually. as a result of these elimination steps,  <dig> new potential mirnas including  <dig> mirnas*, were selected from all three libraries .

cabbage trans-acting sirna prediction
after the conserved and novel mirnas identification, the collection of  <dig> unannotated reads together with  <dig> tags representing parts of exons were subjected to the prediction of potential b. oleracea tas genes. as a result of the used tool, the  <dig> tasirnas from  <dig> loci were proposed . to complement the described analysis, searching for sequences homologous to the known a. thaliana tas <dig>  tas <dig>  tas <dig> and tas <dig> was performed. in this part of study, the tas3a d <dig> was successfully identified in all three cabbage samples . the b. oleracea contig sequence from which mentioned tas3a homologue originates, possess significant similarity  to the tas3a loci in the a. thaliana   <cit> .

northern blot analysis of selected b. oleracea var. capitata mirnas
after the identification of the conserved and novel cabbage mirnas, northern hybridization experiment was conducted for  <dig> selected mirna species. the sequences of the evaluated mirnas are shown in table  <dig>  the presence of eight conserved mirnas, one chosen mirna* and four novel potential mirnas identified in ngs give visible signals . the four novel, confirmed mirnas were named by the mirbase registry according to the standard mirna nomenclature as the bol-mir <dig>  bol-mir <dig>  bol-mir <dig> and bol-mir <dig>  respectively.

mirna putative target prediction and annotation
the roles of mirnas in living organisms are associated with their sequence complementarity to specific mrnas, which leads to the protein translation inhibition or cleavage of those mrnas  <cit> . therefore, the selection and annotation of mirnas targets are essential steps in the designation of mirnas functions in the cell. to better understand the importance of these identified molecules in processes that occur in cabbage leaves, mirnas putative targets prediction was conducted. as a result of miranda program and the rules described in “potential targets prediction for known and novel mirnas” section of the methods, unique mrnas encoding  <dig> potential proteins were proposed as molecules that may interact with the identified cabbage mirnas. the collected targets were further sorted and the best molecules with highest alignment score and lowest mfe of the structure were selected. some of the discovered mirnas showed high sequence complementarity to the multiple regions in one mrna, whereas others were designated as potentially targeting a few different molecules. the potential binding sites of five novel mirnas in their predicted selected targets are presented in figure  <dig>  to gather more information about the probable functions of the identified b. oleracea var. capitata mirnas, the annotation of their potential targets was performed with the blast2go software. this analysis, which involved the blastx search against the arabidopsis genome, revealed many transcription and translation factors among the conserved and novel mirnas potential targets . in addition to these molecules, mrnas of hormone response factor, several transporters, nucleases, kinases, atpases, dehydrogenases, synthases, and heat shock proteins were proposed as interacting with the cabbage mirnas . the group of best conserved and novel mirnas targets were separately subjected to the go classification and enrichment analysis, which revealed that conserved cabbage mirnas may play essential molecular role or be involved in important biological processes, such as the metabolism , response to stimulus , cellular component organization , localization , biological regulation , transport , protein modification process , cell communication , signaling , development , and growth . the similar overrepresented terms were also found in the result of go analysis conducted for novel mirnas targets . the go enrichment examination was additionally proposed for each individual mir family. for some of the identified mirnas, the statistically significant results could not be obtained; however, the calculated enrichment for the rest of analyzed mirs showed several overrepresented go terms, which may help specify biological roles of these individual mirnas families. as an example, the “glucose 6-phosphate metabolic process” term was enriched in bol-mir <dig> annotations , the “auxin binding” was overrepresented in bol-mir <dig> list of go terms , while the “cellular response to oxidative stress” was shown to be enriched in bol-mir_new <dig> annotations  . to specify the exact processes that the selected potential target proteins may participate in, enzyme mapping on the processing pathways from the kegg database was additionally performed. the obtained results demonstrated that many of the identified conserved and novel b. oleracea mirnas may regulate starch and sucrose, purine, amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar, glycerolipid and fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, carbon fixation, and oxidative phosphorylation . these predictions are consistent with potential targets proposals and their experimental validations from several different studies concerning the mirnas in brassicaceae plants  <cit> . with respect to the mirnas functions, determining the potential occurrence of their predicted targets in the cellular components is also important. the go classification demonstrated that the selected proteins, whose mrnas may be targeted by conserved and novel mirnas are located in the nucleus, plasma membrane, cytosol, vacuole, and chloroplasts.

discussion
at the early stage of the mirna research field, mirna species were discovered and analyzed individually or in small groups. currently, the development of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic approaches have enabled the identification of large sets of mirnas that occur in certain tissues, cells or at particular stages. using the above mentioned techniques, the mirna collections have been identified from many species, including model organisms or important food crops  <cit> . one of the vegetables that is significant in some countries due to its health and economic benefits is the brassica oleracea var. capitata . to date, there were only  <dig> b. oleracea mirnas collected in the plant microrna database and  <dig> b. oleracea mirna candidates proposed by wang et al. in the genome-based comparative analysis approach  <cit> . an illumina small rna sequencing was performed to identify a complete set of conserved and novel mirnas in the mature cabbage leaves. a large number of unique reads was generated from three prepared libraries. the distribution of their lengths showed that the most abundant were  <dig> and  <dig> nt long sequences , which is typical for plant mirnas. this result also agreed with the wang et al. study  <cit>  and was the first indication of the number of potential mirnas in the obtained sets of tags. in fact, the raw data processing and the blastn search stages of the bioinformatic analysis enabled the identification of  <dig> conserved mirnas from  <dig> families.

as expected, the molecules that showed the highest abundance in cabbage leaves represents mirnas highly conserved in plants belonging to brassicaceae family, as well as in few others not closely related species. this concerns the mir167a, mir166a, mir168c, mir157a and mir172a  <cit> . in terms of the members, the mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families were the most numerous. furthermore, the mirnas representing families described only in brassicaceae species  <cit>  were also found in the sequencing reads . mature mirna sequences are generated from pre-mirnas, which are further processed into the mirna:mirna* duplex. the mirna strand retains in the system, while mirna* molecule is degraded quickly after its release from the mentioned dsrna. hence, its abundance level is relatively low compared with the sense strand but it can still serve as an indicator of the mature mirna quantity  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> mirnas* from  <dig> families were identified. the most numerous were bol-mir162c*, bol-mir162b*, bol-mir157a*, bol-160a* and bol-mir172b*, and their corresponding mirnas representing the most abundant mir families . as mentioned earlier, wang et al. proposed  <dig> potential b. oleracea mirnas. the occurrence of only  <dig> candidates was verified in this study, which might be explained by low expression level of the remaining potential mirnas in the mature cabbage leaves or their general low expression in the whole plant. the absence of these wang’s et al. mirnas candidates might also suggest that they are potential organ-specific molecules, which are present only in e.g., flowers, roots, stems and seeds.

an important part of the present study was the prediction of novel mirnas. those reads that remained unannotated after the selection of the conserved mirnas were subjected to further bioinformatic analysis. as a result,  <dig> potential new molecules were proposed. the verification of the abundance of  <dig>  mirnas in cabbage leaves was performed by northern blot hybridization, which resulted in confirming the presence of the validated molecules. the sequence length distribution analysis of the mentioned  <dig> mirnas  was additional verification of these particles as a properly annotated mirna species. with respect to the mirna sequence length, it is worth mentioning that in some plants, the mirna-mediated target cleavage leads to the production of secondary sirnas that are able to silence other genes in trans   <cit> . moreover, this regulation depends on the presence of an asymmetric mirna:mirna* duplex, in which the initiatory mirna is  <dig> nt rather than  <dig> nt long  <cit> . among the newly identified mirnas,  <dig> were the most abundant in the  <dig> nucleotide size category . in turn, preformed tasirna prediction analysis proposed  <dig> potential tasirnas from  <dig> loci and sequence homologous to the a. thaliana tas3a. although further studies are needed, at this point some speculations can be made that the identified novel cabbage mirnas might be part of the initial mirna:mirna* duplex participating in the generation of some of these secondary sirnas.

the majority of plant mirnas possess perfect or near-perfect complementarity to their targets  <cit> . this feature is used in many bioinformatic prediction approaches and enables the relatively easy selection of potential target mrnas. at the same time, it could serve as the first step in experimental validation and as a potential source of information about the mirna functions. to determine the roles of the identified mirnas in cabbage leaves, putative target prediction and annotation was performed in present research. the miranda program selected  <dig> mrna molecules potentially interacting with the conserved and novel mirnas, from which the best targets were collected and further analyzed. several different mrna sequences were predicted to be targeted by the same mirna particle, suggesting that these mirnas may play multiple roles in cabbage. the analysis of the obtained results also showed that one mrna is potentially targeted by a number of different mirnas molecules, which might be an additional confirmation of the quality of this specific target prediction. the targets proposed in present study included several translation and transcription factors. a few belonged to the wrky proteins family, which in plants plays a regulatory role in response to bacterial, fungal or viral infections, wounding, or other stresses  <cit> . certain wrky members have also been reported to regulate leaf senescence  <cit> . squamosa promoter binding-like protein  <dig>  is another selected transcription factor and a key player in arabidoposis developmental transition from the juvenile to adult phase. its expression has been shown to be regulated by the mir <dig>  <cit> , which is consistent with the putative target prediction presented in this study. the myb proteins family is one of the larger groups of transcription factors in plants. its members function in a variety of important processes, i.e. development, metabolism, hormone signal transduction, disease resistance, and responses to the environmental stresses  <cit> . in a. thaliana several myb proteins were identified and validated as targets for the mir <dig>  <cit> . member of this family, the myb <dig>  has been also proposed as the best target for the cabbage mir <dig>  the well-known plant molecules – auxins, are implicated in many aspects of plant growth and development as well. in the presence of these hormones, the f-box proteins binds to the transcriptional regulators called aux/iaa molecules, participating at the same time in their ubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . described receptors such as auxin signaling f-box proteins , has been demonstrated by chen et al.  <cit>  and predicted by miranda method to be targeted by mir <dig>  in addition to the above mentioned molecules, mrna of the tpc <dig> transcription factor was proposed and confirmed in earlier studies to interact with the mir <dig>  this polypeptide is responsible for the leaf growth and senescence  <cit> . another putative target protein, which is important in plant senescence and vegetation changes, is the chlorophyllase  <dig>  mentioned enzyme, potentially targeted by cabbage mir399a, was reported to be involved in light controlled chlorophyll  degradation, exactly the catalytic reaction converting the chl to carboxylic acid chlorophyllide  and phytol  <cit> . mirna species not only play important roles in plants growth and development but also affects significantly their response to the various environmental conditions   <cit> . the stress-induced regulatory processes are associated with the change in abundance levels of the specific molecules, such as plasma membrane sulfate transporter  and subunits of the nf-ya transcription factor. the mrna of the b. oleracea st <dig> , protein homologous to the a. thaliana sultr <dig> , was predicted to be the putative target for the cabbage mir395a. overexpressed mir <dig> has been earlier reported to inhibit the transcription of the sultr <dig>  gene during the sulfur deficiency controlling, therefore, the sulfate accumulation and allocation in arabidopsis <cit> . mir169g and mir169n have been shown to target nf-ya <cit> , which in effect down-regulates the nf-y transcription factor in triticum aestivum drought-affected leaves  <cit> .

to gain additional functional insights into the mirna-target interaction and ensure the accuracy of the presented annotation study, the proposed putative targets were subjected to the go enrichment analysis and further mapped on metabolic pathways obtained from the kegg database. the generated list of overrepresented go terms gave general view of the roles, which group of all novel and conserved mirnas molecules may play in the cabbage leaves, e.g. development regulation, involvement in metabolic processes, establishment of the localization, transport, growth, and several other primary biological processes. one of the most enriched go term was the “response to stimulus”. the transcription factors mentioned in the previous paragraph, such as subunits of nf-y, myb proteins, nac-domain containing molecules, auxin response factors, and mirnas interacting with them have been shown to be involved in plants responses to environmental conditions – salt stress, mechanical stress, water or nutrient deficiency, and etc.  <cit> . the conserved as well as the novel mirnas presented in this study were identified in b. oleracea leaves, therefore their targets are expected to be involved in some organ-specific processes. for selected putative targets the “leaf development” was not found in the results of go enrichment analysis, however, the term closely related to it – “organ development” has been shown to be overrepresented. based on the enrichment analysis performed for targets of each individual mir family, the assumption can be made that some of the identified mirna groups have specific molecular function; e.g. mir <dig> participate in auxin binding, bol-mir_new <dig> play potential role in responses to various stimulus, while bol-mir_new <dig> is likely to be involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress. the performed kegg pathway mapping proposed that many of identified cabbage mirnas may take part in the same biological processes but at different stages. one of the processing networks, which include the largest number of mirnas potential targets, was glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. as a result of this set of chemical reactions, glucose is converted into pyruvate, and at the same time, energy is released. in plants, the mentioned energy, in a form of high-energy atp and nadh compounds, is crucial to power respiration. moreover, the intermediates of glycolysis are used in biosynthesis pathways of other molecules, such as amino acids, fatty acids and secondary metabolites  <cit> . glycerolipids metabolism has also been selected as a metabolic pathway that may involve many of mirnas best putative targets enzymes. glycerolipids are major lipids in plant chloroplasts. in addition, they are responsible for photosynthesis efficiency and plant growth under various phosphate availability conditions  <cit> . in addition to the pathways described above, a large group of predicted cabbage mirna targets may participate in starch, sucrose, purine, methane, fatty acid, nitrogen, amino-sugar, and nucleotide-sugar metabolism or in the carbon fixation and citrate cycle. mentioned biological processes are sufficient for normal plant growth and development, which at the same time implies that the regulation of these metabolic pathways by identified mirnas is crucial for the plant to function.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented study shows, for the first time, a set of conserved and novel mirnas that occur in mature b. oleracea var. capitata leaves. the analyzed high-throughput sequencing data were consistent with previous reports concerning the mirnas in brassicaceae species  <cit>  and showed, in a broader sense, the evolutionary relationship between cabbage and other plants. the potential target designation suggested the functions and roles that the identified mirnas might play in cabbage leaves. in the future, experimental verification of some of the predicted target molecules will be important; particularly those that might be crucial for agricultural performance, such as genes responsible for abiotic stress responses . because the complete genome of this food crop is not known yet, the full set of cabbage mirnas and their targets could not be designated. however, presented research does provide important and fairly extensive knowledge about mentioned molecules and their functions. additionally, this knowledge may be useful in studies concerned with methods to increase the yield and improve the ability of cabbage to adapt to various environmental conditions.
