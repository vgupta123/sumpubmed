BACKGROUND
influenza viruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide  <cit> . besides the seasonal influenza epidemics caused by h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> influenza virus strains, new strains of influenza virus emerge periodically with pandemic potential. despite the extensive network in place to monitor influenza virus evolution through mutation and recombination, public health laboratories still fail to detect novel strains of influenza and differentiate those that are primarily animal-adapted from those with true pandemic potential. for example, the outbreak of the swine-origin h1n <dig> pandemic in spring  <dig>  <cit>  hit the medical community unprepared, even though the initial transmission from swine to humans occurred months before, and prior to that it is believed to have circulated undetected in swine for years  <cit> . this underscored the gap in our ability to detect and characterize emerging strains before the widespread onset of disease in the population. early detection of virus strains with pandemic potential is important, as early detection of an outbreak is critical to generate and stockpile sufficient quantities of vaccines and anti-virals to limit the spread of the disease.

one of the challenges in detecting emerging strains is that the factors leading to the generation of a pandemic virus are complex and poorly understood. at a functional level, however, it is clear that for a virus to have pandemic potential it must be capable of human-to-human aerosol transmission and there must exist a substantial population that is immunologically naïve to the strain of virus  <cit> . poor human-to-human transmissibility of avian-adapted h5n <dig> strains causing “bird flu”, for example, seems to be the major impediment to more serious outbreaks  <cit> . recent news on h5n <dig> variants capable of efficient aerosol transmission in ferrets, however, suggest that a few mutations may be sufficient to render bird flu highly transmissible in ferrets and possibly humans  <cit> . therefore, the development of assays that identify subtypes and strains that have the potential to make the jump to humans from animal reservoirs is vitally important for disease surveillance and public health.

we have previously elucidated the role of the influenza hemagglutinin  in aerosol transmissibility  <cit> . ha binding to cell surface glycans present on cells of the upper respiratory tract is the key initial step in viral infection; indeed, ha has been found to be one of the key viral genes involved in infectivity and transmission  <cit> . together, these studies on seasonal and pandemic influenza strains have provided a comprehensive understanding of how high-affinity binding to the distinct topology of ‘long’ α <dig>  linked sialylated glycans is a necessary step in efficient aerosol transmission .

current surveillance methods include genotyping of viral isolates using pcr to identify their type and subtype, as well as comparing the antigenicity of newly identified virus strains to existing strains. despite comprehensive genotypic and phenotypic analyses, it is often difficult to functionally type the virus. given the observed correlation between high affinity to long α2- <dig> sialylated glycans and efficient transmission, we reasoned that a surveillance strategy involving the typing of virus strains, and more specifically, viral has based on their affinity to long α2- <dig> sialylated glycan would provide a robust methodology to detect and predict the transmissibility and therefore pandemic potential of emerging strains.

traditionally, receptor specificities of avian- and human-adapted influenza viruses are determined using a red-blood cell  agglutination assay. rbcs from species such as chicken, turkey, horses, guinea pigs and humans have been used in such assays  <cit> . rbcs have also been used in conjunction with sialidases and sialyltransferase to present certain glycan structures, for example exclusively containing either α2- <dig> or α2- <dig> linked sialic acid  <cit> . this type of assay however is inherently limited in that it fails to account for receptor complexity beyond the sialic acid linkage, i.e. binding to a distinct topology that a glycan receptor adopts based on a variety of determinants such as sequence, linkage, chain length, and branching of sugar molecules. moreover, it has been shown recently that the diversity of sialylated glycans present on rbcs is significantly different from the glycans present in the upper respiratory tract of humans  <cit> . other methods such as fetuin capture assays suffer from the same limitation  <cit> .

the continuous progress of chemoenzymatic synthesis strategies for glycans and development of glycan array platforms has enabled the study of ha specificity using chemically defined glycans  <cit> . intact viruses, recombinantly expressed hemagglutinins, and their mutant forms from h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> subtypes have already been analyzed using glycan arrays  <cit> . while high-quality binding data can be obtained using such arrays, they do not readily lend themselves as a routine tool for virus surveillance due to three major factors: first, the microarrays are synthesized by molecular printing on glass slides using high-precision equipment, and are still costly to manufacture; second, the glycans are covalently bound to the glass, making the array irreversibly rigid and thus not suitable for rapid construction of a custom-made array; and third, typical array formats are interpreted in an on/off manner, rather than through a quantitative readout, thus missing potentially critical information.

here we present an alternative to the planar glycan array using magnetic polystyrene microspheres as a flowing matrix for a modular glycan array. suspension bead arrays offer the advantages of higher flexibility, faster reaction kinetics and greater sensitivity owing to the three-dimensional presentation of glycans. importantly, flow cytometry enables automated, large-scale sample screening. in the past, microspheres in conjunction with flow cytometry have been used for immunoassays, including for the detection of infectious agents such as influenza  <cit> . using custom-designed glycospheres, we developed an assay platform for high-throughput functional characterization of clinical influenza isolates based on their ability to bind to certain host-specific glycan motifs.

RESULTS
glycan motif selection
we have previously reported the glycan diversity in human upper respiratory tissue with a predominance of α2- <dig> sialylated glycans  <cit> . further, analysis of glycan array data of human-adapted influenza viruses revealed them to consistently bind to long α2- <dig> sialylated glycans , despite showing a remarkable overall heterogeneity in their glycan binding patterns,  <cit>  . together, based on these findings, a commonly available α2-6-sialylated tetrasaccharide glycan, ls-tetrasaccharide c , was chosen as a representative influenza receptor of the human upper respiratory tissue. likewise, a structurally related α2- <dig> sialylated glycan, ls-tetrasaccharide a , was chosen as representative receptor for the binding preference of avian influenza viruses  <cit>  . lstc and lsta were biotinylated with a long-chain spacer and purified by hplc to remove excess biotin. conjugation of streptavidin-coated microspheres with either of the biotinylated receptors resulted in receptor-specific glycospheres that were used to capture recombinant hemagglutinin or virus from a small sample volume. bound analyte was then labelled with either a broad-spectrum or subtype-specific antibody and quantified by fluorescent flow cytometry. figure  <dig> illustrates the overall assay schematic.

the glycan density on the microspheres  was found to be a critical parameter for sensitivity of hemagglutinin binding. the receptor binding domain of a single ha monomer binds to sialylated glycans with very weak affinity, and strong avidity to host cell receptors is only achieved by polyvalent binding of multiple ha trimers  <cit> . several commercially available preparations of streptavidin-conjugated microspheres were tested and the microspheres with a high streptavidin density provided the highest sensitivity for detection of lectin and virus binding .

functional assessment of glycosphere receptors
previous studies have reported that glycans adopt a distinct topology in the presence of ha  <cit> . the topology is a function of the linkage of the terminal sialic acid with the penultimate monosaccharide, the length of the oligosaccharide, and its binding mode with ha. high-affinity binding to oligosaccharides with α2-6-linked sialic acid that are tetrasaccharide or longer  has been found to be a key feature for human adaption and human-to-human aerosol transmission  <cit> . to provide proof of concept of our glycosphere assay, we tested the binding characteristics of two human-adapted and two avian-adapted hemagglutinins whose glycan-binding characteristics have been studied in detail. lstc and lsta were used to probe the glycan specificity of human-adapted has from the asian h2n <dig> pandemic of 1957– <dig>  and the h1n <dig> “swine flu” pandemic of  <dig> . in addition we tested avian-adapted has of the h5n <dig> bird flu and an avian h2n <dig> strain from  <dig> . glycospheres with the avian-receptor motif lsta bound has from both vn <dig> and ckpa <dig> in a dose-dependent fashion, with little binding of has from alb <dig> and ca <dig> to the avian receptor . conversely, has from human viruses alb <dig> and ca <dig> bound with high affinity to lstc-glycospheres with little or no binding of has from vn <dig> and ckpa <dig> to the human receptor . these results are consistent with previous findings on planar glycan arrays, and thus served to validate the glycosphere assay as a reliable tool for the functional characterization of influenza binding to host cell receptors.

virus characterization
while quantitative assessment of the ha-glycan interaction for known influenza strains is an important validation of the assay platform, the glycosphere assays are designed to probe the glycan specificity of clinical or veterinarian influenza isolates. a panel of representative influenza a viruses was applied to the glycospheres for receptor-specific binding and incubated with clade/subtype-specific antibodies targeting a conserved region on the stem of ha. captured virus-antibody complexes were probed with a phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody and the glycosphere suspensions were then analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry . glycosphere analysis revealed specific binding of the h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> strains to the human receptor motif lstc , which is in agreement with the fact that these strains were originally isolated from human patient samples. importantly, the glycosphere assay worked equally well with live and inactivated virus as it did with purified hemagglutinin alone . the functional characterization of a clinical isolate of the  <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic  revealed a binding specificity and relative affinity  that is consistent with the binding of ca <dig> hemagglutinin . the h5n <dig> strain a/vietnam/1194/ <dig>  was found to bind to the avian but not the human receptor motif with a binding pattern  identical to the related hemagglutinin of vn <dig> .

assay performance characteristics
to determine the most important assay performance characteristics of the glycosphere assay platform, we studied the reproducibility, limit of detection, and robustness of glycosphere assays. repeating the assay for selected viral isolates at different times, with independently prepared reagents and non-identical virus stocks, revealed the reliability of the assay platform and the reproducibility of receptor-binding characteristics .

to determine the limit of detection of the glycosphere assay, we prepared a serial dilution of influenza a virus to run low viral titers in the glycosphere array. since clinical influenza isolates are routinely quantified by qrt-pcr, we wanted to specify the limit of detection in units of threshold cycle  determined by standard diagnostic procedures used in the clinic  <cit> . the limit of detection was consistently in the range of ct values between  <dig> and  <dig> . the relation of ct values, plaque-forming units, and tcid <dig> is provided in additional file  <dig> 

further, the glycosphere assay was probed for its robustness towards various sample media. both virus growth medium and universal transport medium , which is used in clinical laboratories to collect nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, did not significantly interfere with assay sensitivity and the results were comparable to virus in pbs .

CONCLUSIONS
we introduce here a high-throughput suspension array platform using glycan-coated microspheres for the functional characterization of clinical and veterinarian influenza isolates. the use of two distinct influenza receptor glycans enabled us to rapidly determine the binding preference of a virus and thus assess the level of adaptation of the virus hemagglutinin to human host cells. we anticipate that the assay developed here will complement traditional genotyping assays and provide a functional assessment of the viruses for better surveillance of emerging influenza strains.
