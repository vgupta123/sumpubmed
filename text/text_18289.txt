BACKGROUND
organisms live in environments that vary both spatially and temporally. in such variable environments there are different ways to maximise fitness. life-history traits can either be robust to environmental change  or they can be variable in an environmentally-dependent manner . phenotypic plasticity of a trait can be manifest as a continuous phenotypic range across an environmental gradient, such as the variation in drosophila melanogaster body size metrics across temperature ranges  <cit> . alternatively, phenotypic plasticity may appear as a threshold trait, with apparently distinct phenotypes developing in different environments. an example of this is the switch between winged and wingless aphid morphs in response to host plant quality and, or aphid population density  <cit> . these different phenotypic responses have been termed phenotypic modulation and developmental conversion, respectively  <cit> .

a priori, fitness could be maximised by all traits being fully phenotypically plastic. however, phenotypically plastic traits vary both within and between populations, particularly in the magnitude and sensitivity of their response to environmental change: in the language of phenotypic plasticity, there may be different reaction norms. the existence of this variation suggests that there are limits or costs to the evolution of phenotypically plastic traits and of the reaction norms of traits, and therefore that fitness is maximised by not all traits being fully phenotypically plastic. these costs are likely to be  having sufficiently accurate and robust processes for environmental sensation,  maintaining the genetic and cellular machinery for the development of alternate phenotypes and  co-ordination between different phenotypically plastic traits  <cit> . therefore, all traits can be considered on a continuum from those that are fully plastic, via those with a low level plasticity, to non-plastic, invariant traits. the molecular basis of the phenotypic plasticity of most traits is not clear, but progress in identifying genes involved in such environmental interactions is being made . for many organisms, including intensively studied 'model' species, the role and function of the majority of genes remains unknown  <cit> . it is probable that genes involved in phenotypically plastic traits, especially the means by which the phenotype is modulated in response to the environment, are among these genes with, as yet, unidentified functions. given this, it is crucial to move towards integrating an understanding of the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity with the ecology of the species in question  <cit> .

the model free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans has a phenotypically plastic developmental switch in its life-cycle. in the 'normal' c. elegans life-cycle, progeny moult through four larval stages  into adult worms. under conditions that are unsuitable for growth and reproduction an alternative, developmentally arrested third larval stage, the dauer larva, is formed  <cit> . dauer larvae are environmentally resistant, have a greatly extended lifespan compared with non-dauer larvae, and will only resume normal development as fourth stage larvae  when exposed to more favourable conditions. this developmental conversion  is made based on the worms' perception of environmental quality, which is determined by the concentrations of both food and dauer pheromone and temperature. dauer pheromone is a cue produced by all worms that acts as a measure of con-specific population density  <cit>  and appears to consist of three related molecules  <cit> . the relative concentrations of food and dauer pheromone are used to assess environmental quality: dauer larvae develop under low food and high dauer pheromone concentration conditions, i.e. conditions of environmental stress; 'normal', non-dauer, larvae develop under high food and low dauer pheromone concentration conditions, i.e. conditions of plenty.

geographically distinct isolates of c. elegans vary extensively in the phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva formation  <cit> . that is, for the same change in environmental conditions, there is variation in the proportion of larvae that develop into dauer larvae. the adaptive value of these different plasticities of dauer larva formation is not known. there has been extensive investigation into the genetic and molecular genetic control of the development of dauer larvae  <cit> . however, the genetic basis of the variation between isolates in the phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva development is not known. furthermore, the fitness consequences of different phenotypic plasticities of dauer larva development are not known.

in the c. elegans life-cycle there are other phenotypic responses to conditions of environmental stress. for example adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, the schedule of reproduction and body size all vary as a consequence of food quantity and quality  <cit> . at present little is known about variation between c. elegans isolates in these genotype by environment  interactions and it is not known if they represent separate trait-specific responses to environmental change or are part of a co-ordinated response. hence, it is possible that the fitness of a c. elegans genotype may be maximised by a co-ordinated response to environmental stress of both larval and adult traits. further, it can be envisaged that different strategies may have evolved for how such major larval and adult life-history traits co-ordinately respond to environmental change.

to investigate this, we have analysed recombinant inbred lines  produced from c. elegans isolates n <dig> and dr <dig>  which differ significantly in their plasticity of dauer larvae formation  <cit> . using these, we determined how the development of dauer larvae and the population growth, as assayed by determining population size through time, varied between the rils. population size at any given time is a consequence of both survival and all the factors that contribute to reproduction  this broad analysis was most likely to identify any relationship with dauer larvae development. we found that the c. elegans rils vary in both their phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva development and their population size and that these traits are related. specifically, we found that lines of c. elegans that are highly plastic for dauer larva development also maintain a high population growth rate when stressed . this suggests that c. elegans may co-ordinate its larval development and adult reproductive strategy to respond to environmental stress. we have also mapped the quantitative trait loci  that control the phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva development and of population size. these analyses have identified qtl that affect dauer larva development and population size.

RESULTS
c. elegans varies in its phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva formation
the proportion of dauer larvae that developed in  <dig> rils at two different  food concentrations, i.e. the reaction norm of dauer larvae development, is shown in figure 1a; for clarity these data from one representative assay are shown in figure 1b. rils that are highly plastic for dauer larva formation have the greatest positive difference in the proportion of dauer larvae formed at low food concentrations, compared with high food concentrations ; n <dig> is an example of such a line . other lines are less plastic; dr <dig> is an example of such a line . approximately a quarter of the rils  had a negatively plastic dauer larva development phenotype ; that is, a lower proportion of dauer larvae developed at a low food concentration, compared with a high food concentration . in many of these  <dig> lines, the difference in dauer larva formation between the two food concentrations was very small and, given the inherent variation in this trait and its assay, it is likely that these lines have only a small, or no, plasticity of dauer larva development. however, ten lines had a negative plasticity ≥  <dig> , and were found to consistently show this response in additional assays .

as expected dauer larva formation was significantly affected by food concentration . there was significant variation between the rils  and the rils also varied significantly in their dauer larva formation phenotype in response to changes in the concentration of food , i.e. there is genetic variation between the rils for both overall propensity to form dauer larvae and in their plasticity of dauer larva development with respect to food concentration. there were significant differences between the assays, and in the effect of food concentration between the assays .

the dauer larva development phenotype with respect to dauer pheromone concentration had previously been determined for  <dig> of these rils  <cit> . we used these data to compare the dauer larva development of these lines with respect to changes in the concentration of food and of pheromone. this showed that there was a significant positive correlation between these plasticities of dauer larvae development . this, therefore, suggests that the plasticity of dauer larva development is, at least partially, independent of the particular environmental cue  used for the initiation of dauer larva development.

c. elegans varies in its population growth
we wished to determine how c. elegans varied for another important life-history trait, namely adult reproduction. to do this we determined the population size of  <dig> rils as they grew. this showed that the population sizes of the lines increased over time, but that the rate of this increase differed between the lines . there were significant differences between the population sizes of the lines and in how they grew over time . there were also significant differences between the assays, and in how the populations grew between assays . hence, the rils vary in their population sizes and in how the populations grew over time. at the start of these assays  there are no limitations to population growth; as the size of the population increases , food conditions become limiting and by day  <dig>  the food source is exhausted. we therefore posited that the variation between the rils was due to both differences in the reproductive capacity of the lines , possibly manifest either by variation in their lifetime fecundities or their temporal schedule of reproduction, and by differences in how the reproductive capacity of the lines altered in response to density . these possible explanations were investigated further.

c. elegans varies in its fecundity
one of the principal features of high density environments is a reduction in the per capita food availability. to investigate how the fecundity of c. elegans was affected by this we firstly determined the lifetime fecundity of  <dig> rils under ad libitum food conditions. this showed that these rils had significantly different lifetime fecundities ; fecundity did not differ between experimental blocks . we calculated the rate of reproduction, q, a measure of the rate of increase in the proportion of lifetime fecundity, of the rils and found that this also differed significantly between rils  and between experimental blocks .

these data were used to calculate the expected population size of the lines in the absence of any limits on population growth on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in all cases, the population size was greater than that which was observed. these predicted population sizes correlated with the observed population size on day  <dig> , but not on days  <dig> and  <dig> . this may suggest that at day  <dig>  growing populations of c. elegans are not constrained by density-dependent effects, but at day  <dig> that they are. the absence of a significant correlation on day  <dig> may be due to inter-ril variation in the rate of reproduction.

we next considered how lifetime fecundity and the rate of reproduction, and hence the expected population sizes of the lines, was affected by low concentrations of food, a likely feature of high-density populations. analogously, as above, the lifetime fecundity differed between the lines  and was significantly negatively affected by food concentration . but, the lines did not differ in how their lifetime fecundities were affected by different food concentrations . the rate of reproduction, q, did not differ between lines , but it was significantly affected by the food concentration , such that at lower food concentrations q was lower. the lines also differed significantly in how q was affected by food concentration . together, these results therefore show that the rate of reproduction was affected by food concentration independently of effects on lifetime fecundity.

why does low food concentration reduce fecundity?
the fecundity of wild-type c. elegans is reduced when there is limited food available. we sought to investigate whether this occurs due to  direct effects of caloric restriction per se or  indirect effects on reproduction due to the perception of food availability, i.e. altered resource allocation in response to perceived food limitation. to do this we compared reproduction under a range of food concentrations in mutants defective in pharyngeal pumping with reproduction in wild-type worms. this was done with strains with mild pharyngeal defects  and da <dig> eat-15), with severe pharyngeal defects  and da <dig> eat-10)  <cit>  and n <dig> as a control. here, as far as it is known, the perception of food by all strains will be the same, but the actual acquisition of food will be compromised in the strains with pharyngeal defects, and more strongly so in those with the more severe defects. i.e. the comparison allowed the separation of the acquisition of food from the perception of food. we hypothesised that if caloric restriction  controlled the food concentration-dependent change in the rate of reproduction, q, the rank order of the food-dependent reduction in q would be eat- <dig> and eat-13; eat- <dig> and eat-15; n <dig>  in contrast, if food perception  controlled the food concentration-dependent reduction in the rate of reproduction, q, then no relationship between strength of the pharyngeal defects and food-dependent reduction in fecundity would be observed.

the mutants with the strongest pharyngeal defects  had the lowest rate of reproduction, q, and this was reduced most under lower food concentrations, compared with mutants with mild pharyngeal defects  and compared with n <dig> . this therefore suggests that the food concentration-dependent reduction in the fecundity of c. elegans is directly due to caloric restriction.

qtl analysis
polymorphic markers
to identify markers that would differentiate n <dig> and dr <dig>   <dig> genomic regions of dr <dig> were sequenced and a further  <dig> candidate polymorphisms were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis . overall,  <dig> polymorphisms were detected that differentiated n <dig> and dr1350; this included  <dig> polymorphisms previously identified  <cit> .  <dig> of these  <dig> markers were used to genotype the rils . these markers cover chromosomes i, ii, iii and x . in total,  <dig>  kbp of chromosome iv and  <dig>  kbp of chromosome v of dr <dig> were sequenced, but no polymorphisms between n <dig> and dr <dig> were detected .

for chromosomes i, ii, iii and x, for each polymorphism, its name, the n2/dr <dig> polymorphism, its physical location in n <dig>  <cit> , the forward and reverse pcr oligonucleotide primers  and, where appropriate, the restriction enzyme used for genotyping. * denotes markers only used in the analysis of the nils.  <dig> and  <dig> denote two groups of markers that could not be separated genetically. † denotes the marker scored in the rils by allele specific pcr.

 <dig> rils were genotyped at  <dig> loci. ten of these rils were found to have an n <dig> genotype at all loci and these were excluded from all analyses. for the remaining  <dig> rils, the measured genetic distance between markers was greater than the f2-derived genetic maps  <cit> , with a map expansion of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for chromosomes i, ii, iii and x, respectively. on the x chromosome a group of three markers  and a pair of markers   could not be separated genetically and so the non-informative markers were removed from all further analyses. analysis of the  <dig> remaining markers revealed extensive segregation distortion among the rils, with the overall allele frequency of the  <dig> markers in the  <dig> rils biased to n <dig>  and a variable rate of segregation distortion across chromosomes. this implies that there was selection for the n <dig> alleles at many of the loci during the construction of the rils, a finding common in many studies analysing c. elegans rils .

dauer larva development qtls
comparative interval mapping  of dauer larvae formation in response to different food concentrations in  <dig> rils identified six qtls: two each for the plasticity of dauer larva formation, and for dauer larva formation at high and low food concentrations . five of these qtl occurred on the x chromosome, one,  occurred on chromosome ii. multiple trait cim  analysis of the dauer larva formation at high  and at low  food concentrations supported the qtls identified by cim for dauer formation at low food concentration and one of the qtls for dauer formation at high food concentration . similarly, one of the qtls identified by cim for the plasticity of dauer larvae formation  was supported the mt-cim analysis . cim and mt-cim analyses of dauer larvae formation in response to different pheromone concentrations in  <dig> rils identified no significant qtls. however, there were significant single marker effects predominantly on the x chromosome .

summary of the genetic mapping by single marker and cim of population size on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  dauer larva formation for high  and low  concentrations of food or pheromone and the respective plasticity  of dauer larva formation. for the cim, the estimated locations and effects of qtl significant at a genome-wide level are shown as the proportion of the inter-ril variance explained by the qtl, r <dig>  and, in parentheses, the magnitude of the effect of the qtl where a positive value indicates that the dr <dig> allele increases the trait value compared to the n <dig> allele. marker-trait associations not identified in the cim analysis, but which where significant by single marker analysis are indicated by asterisks, with *, ** and *** denoting significance at the 5%, 1% and  <dig> % levels, respectively.

the chromosome ii qtl affecting dauer larva formation at low food concentration had only a relatively small phenotypic effect . however, analysis of dauer development in nearly isogenic lines , in which the chromosome ii qtl region of the dr <dig> genome was introgressed into n <dig>  suggests that this qtl has a much greater effect and that it affects the dauer larva formation phenotype across a range of food concentrations. this is shown most clearly in the comparison of nil- <dig> to n <dig> and dr <dig> over a range of food concentrations .

population size qtls
cim analysis of the population size at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig> rils identified two qtl each for population size on day  <dig> and on day  <dig>  three of which were on chromosome ii and one on chromosome x . mt-cim analysis of population size supported one of the day  <dig> population size qtls on chromosome ii . no significant qtls were detected by cim for population size on day  <dig> nor were any significant single marker associations identified.

combined, the analyses of dauer development and population size have therefore identified two regions of the c. elegans genome that affect both traits. firstly, there is a region of the x chromosome near marker  <dig> that significantly affects both the population size on day  <dig> and dauer larva formation in response to changes in both the food and pheromone concentrations, by cim and single marker analyses respectively. comparison of these phenotypes among the  <dig> rils for which both phenotypes had been measured showed that the population size on day  <dig> was positively correlated with the plasticity of dauer larva formation in response to pheromone concentration , but not with the plasticity in response to food concentration . secondly, there is a region on chromosome ii near marker  <dig>  that significantly affects both the population size on day  <dig> and dauer larva formation at low food concentrations. however, these traits do not correlate .

we undertook further mapping to investigate the extent of the co-incidence of the chromosome ii qtls affecting both population size and dauer larva formation.

dauer larva development: chromosome ii further mapping
among the rils, those with a dr <dig> genotype at chromosome ii markers  <dig> and  <dig>  formed a significantly lower proportion of dauer larvae compared with those lines either with an n <dig> genotype at both markers and recombinants   . this therefore indicates that the loci underlying the chromosome ii qtl are not located between markers  <dig> and  <dig> and lie to the right of marker  <dig> on chromosome ii .

analysis of dauer larva formation in nils indicated that at a low food concentration , a significantly lower proportion of dauer larvae developed in nils- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> and dr <dig> than in nil- <dig> and n <dig>  , i.e. the presence of the introgressed dr <dig> dna is sufficient to replicate the dr <dig> dauer development phenotype. the genotype data for these nils therefore defines the dr <dig> allele of the chromosome ii qtl affecting dauer development to lie between markers  <dig> and  <dig> on chromosome ii . this combined with the previous definition of the left extremity of the qtl  therefore resolves the qtl to a  <dig>  bp region between markers  <dig> and  <dig>  .

this chromosome ii qtl region in n <dig> is predicted to contain  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes   <cit> . the rnai phenotypes, gene ontology  terms, and both the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of these genes do not present any obvious candidates for the control of the dauer larva development phenotype. however, thirteen of these  <dig> predicted genes and  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted pseudogenes are predicted to be 7-transmembrane receptors  <cit> . the role of these receptors in information transduction, may suggest that a polymorphism in one of these genes or pseudogenes, such that an n <dig> pseudogene is active in dr <dig>  may underlie the differences in dauer larva development of these lines.

the  <dig> qtl identified on the x chromosome could not be defined to small genomic regions. the combined confidence limits for these qtl encompass approximately a third of the x chromosome . within this region there are a number of genes known to be involved in dauer larva development, e.g. daf- <dig>  daf- <dig>  dyf- <dig> and dyf- <dig>  <cit> . the phenotypic effect of the x chromosome qtl may therefore be due to one of these genes and, or other loci within this region.

population size: chromosome ii further mapping
analysis of the population size trait indicated that on day  <dig>  the population sizes of n <dig> and nil- <dig> were significantly greater than those of nils- <dig> and - <dig>  which were in turn greater than that of dr <dig>  . the genotype data for these nils therefore resolves the dr <dig> allele affecting population size on day  <dig> to a  <dig>  bp region between markers  <dig> and  <dig> . in n <dig>  this region is predicted to contain  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes   <cit> . the rnai phenotypes, go terms and both the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of these genes do not suggest any obvious candidates for the control of the population size phenotype.

discussion
extensive variation in both the phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva development and population size phenotypes among the rils was observed. for both phenotypes, there were rils with phenotypes more extreme than the parental lines . indeed, such transgressive segregation appears to be common in c. elegans and has been observed for a number of other life-history traits . the variation in dauer larva development between rils was similar in magnitude to that previously observed among a small number of rils  <cit> . however, we observed that approximately 5% of the lines had substantial negative plasticity of dauer larva formation; that is, dauer larva formation was greatest at the higher food concentration. a similar phenomenon was observed in the phenotypic analysis of synthesised daumone, where across a range of food concentrations, negative phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva formation was observed at very low food concentrations, but beyond a mid-concentration of food, there was positive phenotypic plasticity  <cit> . we hypothesise that in the rils studied here this previously reported negative plasticity phenotype  <cit>  has become manifest for some the rils because of a shift in these lines of their sensitivity to the concentration of food.

the adaptive value of the c. elegans dauer larva and the variation in its formation is unknown, largely due to our limited knowledge of the natural history of this species. in compost-rich soils, c. elegans is mostly found as dauer larvae rather than as reproducing adults  <cit> . the comparative abundance of this life-cycle morph in the wild therefore suggests its central importance for c. elegans and that the control of the formation of dauer larvae is likely to be under strong natural selection. this suggests that variation in the plasticity of dauer larva formation may also be under similarly strong selection and hence that this variation may be adaptive.

the observed population sizes of the rils were smaller than those predicted from measures of lifetime fecundity and reproductive schedule. in these assays on day  <dig> the food supply is exhausted which suggests that by this time the growing population is subject to density-dependent effects. the c. elegans rate of reproduction is lower in low food concentration settings. comparison of the rate of reproduction of eat mutants suggests that the rate of reproduction is determined directly by calorific restriction, thus, that density-dependent effects on reproduction come about by such caloric restriction. this trait is therefore different from the dauer larva developmental choice, in which a developmental decision is made based primarily on the multi-factor perceived environmental conditions. that is, the density-dependent effects on reproduction are a consequence of the internal state of the worm while the effects on dauer development are a consequence of the external environment.

in summary, under conditions of reduced food availability, a likely significant environmental stress, larval stages of c. elegans form dauer larvae and the reproduction of the adult hermaphrodites is altered, which reduces the rate of reproduction. therefore, these different life-cycle stages both have strategies for responding to this environmental stress and that these larval and adult hermaphrodite responses to this stress vary between lines. there are consistent differences in c. elegans life-history traits when grown on two different food sources. on chemically defined liquid media, both development and lifetime fecundity are reduced and lifespan increased compared with worms grown on an ngm/op <dig> food source  <cit> . these results suggest the existence of at least two distinct adult life histories: one maximizing the intrinsic rate of population increase , and the other the efficiency of exploitation of the carrying capacity of the environment   <cit> . our observations that c. elegans varies in its reproductive response to altered food conditions, is therefore in general concordance with these observations.

we detected substantial genetic polymorphism between n <dig> and dr <dig> for much of the genome. however, we did not detect any genetic differences between these isolates on chromosomes iv and v nor in ~ <dig> mbp of the x chromosome. this supports previous observations  <cit>  that also did not detect any polymorphisms between n <dig> and dr <dig> in several regions of the genome, including those noted here.

our genetic mapping analyses identified  <dig> qtl that affect either dauer larva development or population size . there are two principal regions of the genome, on chromosomes ii and x, that affect both dauer larva development and population size. the dauer larva development and population size qtls identified on the x chromosome could not be separated and, as would be expected given the position and effects of the day  <dig> population size and dauer development qtls on the x chromosome , these traits are positively correlated in the rils. however, given the limited resolution of these qtls little can be inferred about the genes underlying these qtls. in contrast, detailed analysis of the chromosome ii region separates the day  <dig> population size and dauer larva development phenotypes  showing that they are not controlled by the same loci. crucially, the chromosome ii region that can control dauer larva formation does not include any genes previously identified to affect this phenotype; therefore a new locus or loci that affects dauer larva development has been discovered. this locus or loci may not have been identified previously by more usual mutagenesis analyses, perhaps because there may not be a severe  dauer formation  loss of function phenotype.

the qtls for population size appeared, on average, to have greater phenotypic effects compared with those affecting dauer larva development . however, for the chromosome ii dauer larvae development qtl, the phenotypic effect size is greater in the nil analysis compared with the qtl analysis  and this qtl affects dauer development across a range of food concentrations . the difference between the effect size observed in the rils and the nils could have a number of explanations. it is unlikely that there are epistatic interactions between the dr <dig> introgressed region and the n <dig> genome, since no such interactions were detected between qtls. similarly, we consider it unlikely that the difference between the estimated phenotypic effect size of the qtl in the rils and the observed effect size in the nils is due to the separation in the nils of loci with opposing effects on dauer larva formation given the relatively large size  of the dr <dig> region introgressed in nil- <dig>  the greater than expected phenotypic effect of the qtl in the nils may therefore be an underestimate due to variation in trait measurement in these analyses . alternatively, the increased effect of the qtl in the nils may be a consequence of the use of daumone, rather than pheromone extract in the assay of the nils. because daumone is only one of three active compounds in dauer pheromone  <cit> , a larger observed effect would be expected in the nil analyses if the chromosome ii qtl represented a polymorphism in a gene specifically involved in the response to daumone. indeed, this would be consistent with the suggestion that no candidate dauer pheromone receptors have been isolated because different receptors respond to the different active compounds in the pheromone  <cit> . hence, the disruption of the receptor for one component of dauer pheromone would not be expected to produce a dauer defective phenotype. within this region there are many predicted 7-transmembrane receptors  <cit> , and such receptors have been implicated in the response to dauer pheromone by the finding that the g-protein α-subunits gpa- <dig> and - <dig> are involved in the response to pheromone  <cit> . one possibility is that one of these genes is the basis of the qtl.

this work has shown that the larval dauer/non-dauer developmental decision and adult reproduction are affected by environmental conditions and that this varies among c. elegans rils. these analyses have been undertaken on natural variation in these traits, thereby reflecting some aspect of how these traits have evolved and, or are maintained. these results further suggest the hypothesis that the same, or closely linked genes, may co-ordinate the response of these different life-history traits to environmental stress and that there are different evolved strategies by which these traits can be deployed. further, detailed genetic analyses are required to fully resolve this.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  c. elegans alters both its propensity to form dauer larvae and its adult rate of reproduction and lifetime fecundity, in response to environmental stress.

 <dig>  c. elegans isolates vary in their dauer larva formation and adult reproductive phenotypes and how these vary in response to stress. changes in dauer larva development and adult reproductive strategy are related, shown by the correlation of these traits among rils.

 <dig>  qtl analyses have identified regions on chromosome ii and x that control dauer larva development and population size. the chromosome ii qtl was further resolved to genetically separate the control of these two phenotypes.

 <dig>  genetic analysis of the chromosome ii qtl affecting dauer larva formation, resolved this to a c.  <dig> kbp region containing no genes known to be involved in dauer development.

 <dig>  c. elegans has a co-ordinated larval and adult response to environmental stress controlled, at least in part, by physically close genomic regions.
