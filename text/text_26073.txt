BACKGROUND
many studies have found segregating quantitative trait loci  for milk production traits in different dairy cattle populations . however, even for relatively large effects with a saturated marker map, the confidence interval  for qtl location by linkage analysis spans tens of map units, or hundreds of genes. many studies have shown that ci for qtl can be further reduced by application of linkage disequilibrium  mapping . this requires genotyping additional polymorphisms within the ci, generally single nucleotide polymorphisms . although any marker within the ci can be used for ld mapping, it is reasonable to start with polymorphisms embedded within genes that are likely candidates for the qtl  <cit> .

genes within the confidence interval that have some physiological relevance to the trait will be considered primary candidates for the qtl. for example, grisart et al.  <cit>  concluded that the gene dgat <dig>  which is involved in triglyceride synthesis, is the causative gene for the qtl affecting milk fat on bta <dig>  wayne and mcintyre  <cit>  have suggested combining mapping and arraying as an approach to identify candidate genes. thus, gene expression analysis can bridge the gap between fine mapping and quantitative trait nucleotide  determination by revealing regulatory variation in genes for complex traits  <cit> . specific tissue of origin of expressed sequence tags , tissue-specific, and tissue-selective gene expression may also indicate a potential role of genes in regulation of qtl  <cit> . microarrays have been used to measure relative expression, and thus identify candidate genes responsible for qtl  <cit> . additional criteria may be proposed to select qtl candidate genes as follows:

 <dig>  genes are preferentially expressed in organs related to the quantitative trait, i.e. the mammary gland for milk production traits.

 <dig>  genes are preferentially expressed in developmental stages related to the phenotype, i.e. at the onset of lactation for milk production traits.

su et al.  <cit>  measured the mouse and human protein-encoding transcriptomes, and used them to profile a panel of human and mouse tissues in gene atlas, therby providing a resource to address tissue-specific expression. the usda has announced a project to construct a bovine gene atlas using gene expression analysis data derived from  <dig> tissues of the cow genome.

although a cdna microarray resource enhanced for bovine mammary gland has been developed  <cit> , and a bovine oligonucleotide dna microarray was used to identify estrogen-responsive genes in the bovine mammary gland  <cit> , there is no information available on bovine mammary gland gene expression at different stages of development. however, detailed studies examining gene expression in the mammary gland during, puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and involution have been carried out in the mouse  <cit> . in these studies the same microarray platform  was used in similar mouse inbred lines resulting in a high level of replication, and consequently in one of the best data resources on mammary tissues gene expression relevant to milk production traits. in addition, the high conservation of gene order in mammals enables comparative mapping to be a useful approach linking clusters of genes with similar function between mouse and cattle  <cit> . we have utilized murine mammary gland gene expression in combination with bovine qtl mapping data to create a web tool  that compiles all the available information to aid in the identification of candidate genes for qtl of milk production traits in dairy cattle.

RESULTS
analysis of gene expression from three experiments
a total of  <dig> probe sets with significant differential expression across the four stages in the current study were obtained using anova. the venn diagram in figure  <dig> shows that two other microarray experiments  <cit>  using the same statistical analysis found thousands of significant probe sets . observed and expected frequencies for probe sets discovery in the three experiments alone and in the two experiments of clarkson and stein are given in table  <dig>  the chi-squared value for joint discovery of probe sets in clarkson and stein experiments was  <dig>  of the  <dig> significant probe sets in the current study,  <dig>  were common to all three experiments. the expected value was only  <dig> and the chi-squared value was  <dig>

2highly significant by any criterion

the  <dig> probe sets were assigned to  <dig> bovine genes. three clones containing repeats,  <dig> unknown probe sets and  <dig> redundant probes were excluded. the expression profile of the  <dig> genes is presented in figure  <dig>  the distribution of genes by functional categories is presented in figure  <dig>  the majority of genes were assigned to metabolism, immune cascade, transport, regulation of transcription and signal transduction functional categories.

the explained variance of expression of the  <dig> genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig> % using  <dig> to  <dig> k means clustering. six k-means classifications were determined as the optimal number of clusters based on highest explained variance and minimum redundancy between similar clusters. the clustering explained 53% of the variance of expression. each one of the six clusters was designated with its unique expression profile signature across stages  and is presented in figure  <dig>  there were  <dig> over expressed genes at lactation only , and  <dig> additional over expressed genes at lactation with differential expression in other stages . among the typical genes of lactation stage are the milk protein and biogenesis genes . fifteen genes were upregulated at involution only  such as cxcl <dig> and slpi, involved in chemotaxsis and immune response processes . thirty-two genes were upregulated at pregnancy only . for example, crabp <dig> and csrp <dig>  which are involved in development and cellular differentiation  <cit>  are included in this group. the smallest group of six genes including myosin  were upregulated at puberty, and downregulated at lactation . of the  <dig> significant genes,  <dig>  showed mammary gland-specific expression . of these,  <dig> genes were upregulated at the onset of lactation, and the remaining genes were up regulated at pregnancy  and at involution .

comparative mapping
the ongoing effort for annotation of the bovine genes on the draft sequence allows identification of many bovine orthologs of the murine genes represented by the probe sets of mg-u74av <dig>  however, for many genes the chromosomal location is still unknown. larkin et al.  <cit>  reported about 90% accuracy in prediction of cattle chromosome locations based on the human genome. thus we used the human sequence of orthologous genes to predict the location of bovine genes with unknown chromosomal location.

cgqtl data base
the structure of the cgqtl navigator is presented in figure  <dig>  the navigator presents an html list of candidate genes by bovine autosomes for qtl for milk production traits. genes with mammary gland-specific expression are denoted with one to three stars indicating their level of specificity. qtl for milk production traits were found in all bovine autosomes and are referred through two dedicated data bases, qtl viewer and qtl map. in the latter, qtl are denoted with one to three stars in relation to the number of literature references where the qtl was reported. candidate genes for qtl were found in all but two autosomes. number of candidate genes for qtl per chromosome ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  as a demonstration, a co-localization of eight candidate genes with the qtl region for milk production traits on bat <dig> is presented in figure  <dig>  the gene abcg <dig> which was determined as the causative gene for this qtl appears on the list. the expression profile of this gene at pregnancy and lactation was in accordance to that in cattle  <cit> .

discussion
three data sets with affymetrix mg-u74av <dig> mammary gland arrays were compared along four developmental stages at puberty, pregnancy, lactation and involution. the additional data set of rudolph et al.  <cit>  consisted of the same developmental stages excluding puberty, and thus was not analyzed in this study. the mammary gland at the four selected developmental stages consists of different cell populations and processes, and therefore, most of the genes will show differential expression if sufficient number of replicates are included in the analysis. two microarray experiments  <cit>  used  <dig> animal replicates, while the current study  <cit>  used nine animal replicates. the same filtering, normalization, and analysis of variance was applied on data of the three experiments. the first two studies found thousands of significant genes, as compared to hundreds in the current study. this is apparently due to the major difference in the number of replicates. among the mammary gland-specific probe sets only four have unknown function . analysis of these genes may reveal their important role in the mammary gland.

based on comparative mapping nearly all of the differentially expressed genes were mapped to their bovine chromosomal positions. the rate of chromosomal breakage during mammalian evolution is doubled in the rodent lineage compared to the cattle lineage  <cit> . therefore we based the prediction of cattle chromosome locations on the human genome and the detailed cattle-human comparative maps  <cit> . the genes were encoded for expression  in each of the four developmental stages, and were clustered to six expression profiles, out of the  <dig> possible profile combinations . these clusters correspond to genes showing upregulation uniquely at pregnancy or lactation or involution, and differential expression at combinations of stages involving puberty, pregnancy, and lactation. rudolph et al.  presented a thorough study of expression profiling of secretory activation of  <dig> genes using  <dig> clusters, and clarkson et al.  <cit>  analyzed the expression profiling of  <dig> genes using  <dig> clusters.

our cgqtl web tool  <cit>  allows for navigation between the map of bovine milk production qtl, the overlaid candidate genes and the visual presentation of their expression in the mammary gland array and in geneatlas. genes that are mammary gland-specific are indicated. to truly infer that a differentially expressed gene, which is located in a qtl, is a candidate gene for a trait being studied, information on the cis- or trans-regulation of the gene needs to be presented  <cit> . however, such data is not available for bos taurus. therefore, our cgqtl tool was developed to provide the best current compilation of information to identify candidate genes for milk production in cattle, and will continue improving as we add more sources of information.

the argument could be made against the feasibility of using mouse data to make inferences to bovine mammary gland gene expression. however, our objective in this work was to create a tool  that utilizes the best available sources of information, such as mouse gene expression data during mammary development and bovine qtl mapping data to develop hypotheses on potential candidate genes underlying qtl. this is a comparative approach to integrate information in the difficult task of identifying candidate genes. we envision that in the future the mouse gene expression data used in cgqtl will be complemented with bovine gene expression data from experiments using cdna microarrays  <cit> , bovine oligonucleotide arrays  and with the affymetrix genechip® arrays . cgqtl navigator will also be linked to the bovine geneatlas which will be developed using gene expression analysis derived from  <dig> bovine tissues. likewise, cgqtl may be expanded for qtl of reproduction  <cit> . various resources for the study of ovarian transcriptome may be integrated into cgqtl to predict candidate genes for qtl related to reproductive traits  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a web tool for candidate genes for qtl  that allows navigation between the map of bovine milk production qtl, the overlaid candidate genes and the visual presentation of their expression in the mammary gland array and in geneatlas. three out of four confirmed genes that affect qtl in livestock were over expressed in the target organ. thus, cgqtl can be used to determine priority of candidate genes for qtn analysis based on differential expression in the target organ.
