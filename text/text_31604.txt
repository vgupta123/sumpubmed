BACKGROUND
most animal genomes include multiple gata transcription factor genes with widely conserved developmental roles <cit> . within vertebrates, gata transcription factors are required for the proper specification of cardiac and blood cell lineages, for the induction and differentiation of endoderm and mesendoderm, and in cell movement during gastrulation and neural projections. in xenopus laevis, overexpression of gata <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> can induce endoderm formation  <cit> . similarly, the nematode gata <dig> ortholog end- <dig> is necessary and sufficient to generate e or endodermal cell fate in c. elegans, and it also can induce endoderm when ectopically overexpressed in xenopus  <cit> .

the gata transcription factor family is a relatively small and evolutionary tractable gene family, with only six members present in mammals, five in insects, and eleven in the nematode c. elegans. this gene family has undergone significant expansion in bilaterians compared to lower metazoans. for example, only a single gata gene has been found in two cnidarian genomes currently sequenced  <cit> .

previous studies have demonstrated that the six vertebrate gata factors comprise two classes of evolutionarily related genes, a gata- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> class and a gata- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> class  <cit> . these two gata factor groups can be identified throughout bilaterian animals, suggesting that the last common ancestor of protostome and deuterostome genomes contained at least two gata genes, with both a gata <dig> and a gata <dig> ortholog. our recent survey of gata genes from the whole-genome sequence of multiple protostome genomes has identified at least four gata genes in every currently available protostome genome, with gene duplications having occurred only within the gata <dig> class  <cit> .

in contrast, two basal deuterostomes , the echinoderm strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the urochordate ciona intestinalis, encode just two gata transcription factor genes, similar in number to the predicted ancestral bilaterian state  <cit> . however, these gata genes are highly divergent in sequence and bear only faint resemblance to the two gata classes typical of most animal genomes. indeed, a recent phylogenetic study of this gene family  <cit>  concluded that the small gata gene repertoire of two in s. purpuratus and c. intestinalis, relative to the eleven nematode and six vertebrate gata genes, resulted from secondary and independent losses of gata genes in these lineages. in addition to the uncertainty about their gata gene origins, both echinoderms and urochordates have undergone exceptional shifts in their developmental modes relative to other deuterostome phyla. thus it has remained difficult to ascertain the number, structural features, and roles of the ancestral deuterostome gata gene complement.

deuterostomes include several major groups of invertebrate and vertebrate animals   <cit> . the first major deuterostome division occurred between ambulacrarians  and chordates. the chordates then split into three groups: cephalochordates, urochordates, and vertebrates. recent studies indicate that urochordates are the closest outgroup to vertebrates  <cit> , although urochordates are extremely diverged on both molecular and morphological levels  <cit> . the first split of vertebrates occurred between jawless and jawed vertebrates , followed with the divergence of jawed vertebrates into cartilaginous and bony fish . there are two major groups of extant bony fish, ray-finned and lobe-finned, with the former having given rise to teleost fish and the latter to tetrapods.

there is ample evidence for multiple rounds of whole genome duplication in vertebrate lineages. two genome duplication events are thought to have occurred near the base of the vertebrate lineages. the first genome duplication event  has been proposed to occur prior to the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates, with a second genome duplication event  occurring only in jawed vertebrates lineage  <cit> . however, a more recent survey of multiple lamprey and hagfish gene families concluded that the ancestor of extant jawless vertebrates also underwent two whole genome duplication events, suggesting that two rounds of whole genome duplication occurred very early in the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . finally, an additional whole genome duplication event  appears to have occurred in ray-finned fish  <cit> . during each of these genome duplication events, two paralogous chromosomal regions  would be created from each pre-duplication chromosomal region, and each paralogon would initially contain a single paralog for each pre-duplicate gene. therefore, for each 0r  deuterostome gene, there could be maximally two genome-duplicated paralogs in 1r animal genomes, four in 2r genomes, and eight in 3r genomes, though neutral drift should quickly eliminate most of duplicated paralogs  <cit> . we refer to paralogs resulting from genome duplication events as ohnologs, following the convention suggested by k. wolfe  <cit>  in honour of susumu ohno, who first proposed the occurrence of these genome duplication events during key transitions of vertebrate evolution  <cit> . because vertebrate genomes contain six gata factor genes, compared to only two in two different deuterostome invertebrate genomes, it has been suggested that the gata transcription factor gene family may have expanded in vertebrates by the retention of ohnologous genes  <cit> .

to more conclusively address the ancestral deuterostome condition, we have identified the gata transcription factor complement within the whole genome sequence of two additional and less derived invertebrate deuterostomes, the hemichordate saccoglossus kowalevskii and the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae. these analyses include nine diverse vertebrate genome sequences, and address gene phylogeny using both gene sequence and genomic context comparisons. importantly, one well-conserved gata <dig> gene family member and one well-conserved gata <dig> family member was found within each invertebrate deuterostome genome analyzed. thus our study provides the strongest evidence yet that the ancestral deuterostome genome contained two distinct gata genes, one gata <dig> homolog and one gata <dig> homolog, from which every deuterostome gata gene including the vertebrate complement originated. we conclude that hemichordates and cephalochordates have retained members of both gata classes. these analyses further indicate that all vertebrate gata genes retain conserved syntenic ohnologs, supporting the hypothesis that the expansion of the vertebrate gata family has resulted almost exclusively from whole-genome duplication events.

RESULTS
identification of hemichordate and cephalochordate gata sequences
while we recently concluded that the genome of the ancestor to both deuterostomes and protostomes encoded two gata transcription factors  <cit> , another group  <cit>  suggested that at least five gata factors were encoded by the genome of the last common ancestor of fruit flies, nematodes, and vertebrates, with subsequent losses occurring in some deuterostome lineages . to further address this issue, we have identified gata factor gene sequences from the available genomes of two additional deuterostome invertebrates, the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae and the hemichordate saccoglossus kowalevskii.

in the cephalochordate b. floridae genome sequence, with  <dig> × coverage, we could identify only two gata factor genes. tblastn analysis of the b. floridae trace archives was conducted with local blast servers  <cit>  to identify ~ <dig> amino acid  fragments from two distinct gata genes. an initial reciprocal blast suggested that these fragments encode distinct gata1/2/ <dig> and gata4/5/ <dig> orthologs, and this initial assignment was also supported by the phylogenetic analyses below; therefore we refer to these as bflogata <dig> and bflogata <dig>  these fragments encode a highly conserved dual zinc finger domain  <cit>  within three exons . two genomic scaffolds were identified from the pre-release genomic assembly jgi-assembled genome containing these fragments http://genome.jgi-psf.org/brafl1/brafl <dig> home.html. by conducting bl2seq sequence comparisons on larger regions of these scaffolds, less conserved 5' and 3' ends of each gene encoding the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of each protein was identified.

in a blastn search of these two predicted bflogata genes against sequenced est libraries,  <dig> ests were identified for the bflogata <dig>  defining the full length mrna for this gene . confirmation of the transcription of the bflogata <dig> gene was made by pcr amplification of a predicted  <dig> nucleotide  fragment with gene specific primers from a gastrula/neurula cdna library.

for the bflogata <dig> ortholog, we were unable to identify any est from the pre-release database. we therefore defined a gene model for the 5' domain through the conserved dual zinc finger domain based on sequence comparison to human and platynereis gata sequences. gene specific primers were designed to a predicted 5' start codon, and the conserved dual zinc finger domain. two clones were isolated via pcr from a bflo cdna library, with  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide inserts. using the splign program  <cit> , these fragments both aligned to the same region of jgi:scaffold  <dig>  and are presumably alternative splice forms. these splice forms are identical with the exception of alternative seconds exons, with the smaller splice form incorporating a novel exon that eliminates the first zinc finger domain.

in the genomic trace archive of the hemichordate saccoglossus kowalevskii, with 7× coverage, we have used our gene family finder program  to computationally identify two orthologs. a reciprocal blast analysis suggested these to be a single gata <dig> ortholog and a single gata <dig> ortholog, which held true with the additional phylogenetic analyses below, and we have therefore named these skowgata <dig> and skowgata <dig>  respectively. through comparisons to the bflogata gene sequences, four exons from each skowgata  were identified. within skowgata <dig>  two exons encode the conserved first and second zinc fingers, as well as two exons 5' to the conserved zinc finger domain. no additional 3' exon sequences were identified, including the 3' conserved domain exon described for other gatas, but it is possible that this sequence is divergent or not represented in the current trace archive. for skowgata <dig>  three exons that encode the first zinc finger, second zinc finger, and a 3' conserved lysine-rich region from the conserved dual-zinc domain were identified, as well as an additional single large 5' exon.

in summary, we have found that two additional deuterostome invertebrate genomes each have only two gata transcription factors genes, further supporting our previous conclusion that the last common ancestor to all deuterostomes had only two gata factor genes.

identification of additional vertebrate gata factors
to further investigate the expansion of gata factors in vertebrates, we conducted exhaustive searches for gata factor members within nine vertebrate genomes, including five teleost and four tetrapod species, again using in silico searches of annotated proteins and whole genome contigs, as well as genomic trace files, to identify the complete gata complement for each genome. each of the tetrapod genomes were found to contain six gata factors genes, consistent with previous studies  <cit> . however, we also identified seven or eight gata factor genes in each of the teleost genomes examined . the expansion from two pre-genome duplication  gata factors, to six gata factors in the tetrapod , and eight in the teleost , is consistent with gata family growth via genome duplication.

identification of class specific motifs
we next examined the cephalochordate and hemichordate gata genes to determine if they include gata123- and 456-class specific conserved coding sequence motifs, identified in a previous study  <cit> . bflogata <dig> exhibits one of the most complete and well conserved set of ortholog-specific motifs from our data set , containing all  <dig> previously identified motifs, which exhibit 38–76% amino acid identity with at least one other example of that motif. bflogata <dig> contains all  <dig> motifs identified within human gata <dig> orthologs, and an additional n-terminal motif previously only identified in the platynereis pdumgata <dig>  the sea urchin spurgatae, and the sole anemone gata nvecgata.

the percent identity shared between motifs and conserved domains from cephalochordate , hemichordate , and echinoderm  gatas compared to polychaete  and sea anemone  gatas. scores based upon pairwise alignment percent identity scores in individual alignments.

similar to bflogata <dig>  skowgata <dig> includes  <dig> n-terminal motifs identified within human gata <dig> orthologs, and an additional n-terminal motif previously identified only in the platynereis pdumgatata <dig>  the sea urchin spurgatae, and the sole anemone gata nvecgata. no skowgata <dig> conserved c-terminal motifs were detected, but all five previously identified motifs n-terminal to the zinc finger domains could be identified.

conserved splice site boundaries within the two deuterostome gata classes
to further analyze deuterostome gata gene family members, we next examined conservation of exon/intron structures. the genome assemblies were compared to the translated amino acid sequence to map splice sites and exon/intron boundaries. when the b. floridae cephalochordate and s. kowalevskii hemichordate gata genes were compared to their human, fish, and sea anemone orthologs, we found all of the genes contain two internal introns that divide the conserved dual-zinc finger domain into first zinc finger, second zinc finger, and 3' lysine rich encoding exons . the positional conservation of these two introns correlates with the high conservation of the dual zinc-finger domain, relative to the rest of the protein, in almost all animal gata transcription factors  <cit> . thus, an ancestral exon/intron structure of the core conserved dna binding domain has been retained in both deuterostome gata <dig> and gata <dig> gene families.

we also identified differences in the exon/intron boundaries of gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes, 5' and 3' of the conserved dual-zinc finger regions. these differences produce distinctive exons that encode the class specific n- and c-terminal motifs  <cit> . the cephalochordate bflogata <dig>  the hemichordate skowgata <dig>  and the echinoderm gata <dig> ortholog spurgatae, as well as the human hsapgata <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes and the zebrafish drergata <dig> and  <dig> genes, all have a single exon 5' of the zinc finger domain exons, with this one exon encoding all of the identified gata <dig> motifs. however, bflogata <dig>  skowgata <dig>  and the human and zebrafish gata  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes all are encoded by two 5' exons, with two conserved motifs located within the first exon and three within the second. a comparison to the motifs shared with nvecgata found that this intron has been observed only within bilaterian gata <dig> factors  <cit> . we therefore suggest that the single 5' exon in gata <dig> genes may represent the ancestral condition for all gata genes, and that a subsequent intron insertion occurred shortly after the duplication of the ancestral gata gene in the gata <dig> lineage.

in contrast to their 5' exons, the 3' structure of the deuterostome gata <dig> genes is more conserved than the 3' structure of the gata <dig> genes. the analyzed cnidarian, echinoderm, cephalochordate, and vertebrate gata <dig> orthologs each have only a single large 3' exon , and all of these orthologs contain two identifiable conserved motifs in this region. in contrast, the 3' ends of the gata <dig> genes are more variable, and no conserved motifs have been identified among these genes; human and zebrafish gata  <dig> and  <dig> genes, and the zebrafish gata  <dig> gene, are split into  <dig> short exons, the first of which is conserved in the cephalochordate bflogata <dig>  these additional two 3'-most exons appear to be diagnostic for vertebrate gata <dig> genes. however, the echinoderm gata <dig> ortholog has two large 3' exons, while only a single short 3' exon can be identified in the hemichordate or cephalochordate gata <dig> orthologs, though these identifications may not be complete due to a lack of sequence conservation in these regions. thus, it appears that lineage-specific acquisition of 3' exon/intron structure and sequence divergence has occurred for gata <dig> factors, whereas the gata <dig> factors appear to retain a 3' structure similar to that of the sole anemone nvgata gene. our analysis of the class-specific features, including both conserved amino-acid motifs and intron/exon boundaries, provides further support to the view that all deuterostome gata genes are members of either the gata <dig> for the gata <dig> subfamilies.

prediction of an additional 5' exon in the s. purpuratus gata <dig> gene 
because two 5' exons are conserved in chordate and hemichordate gata genes, and because echinoderms are a sister group to the hemichordates, we were surprised that only one 5' exon was described in the previously characterized echinoderm gata <dig> ortholog, spurgatac. furthermore, motifs encoded by the 5' most exon in other deuterostome gata <dig> genes are also present in protostome gata <dig> orthologs  <cit> , suggesting that either the s. purpuratus gatac gene lost its first exon at some point, or that the gene is currently incorrectly annotated. using tblastn searches of the s. purpuratus genomic sequence with the 5' exon from bflogata <dig>  but not with those from other deuterostome gata <dig> genes, we identified a  <dig> base pair  region with significant  similarity, approximately  <dig> kilobase  upstream of the current exon  <dig> in the spurgatac gene. this sequence includes an open reading frame of  <dig> residues with an n-terminal motif 64% identical in amino acid sequence to the corresponding motif in bflogata <dig> . however, this open reading frame begins abruptly within this motif and does not include a 5' start codon. this result appears to be consistent with tblastn searches of the s. purpuratus genomic trace archive directly, in which  <dig> of  <dig> traces identified containing this orf also have a stop codon at the same position , suggesting that this stop codon is not a sequencing error. therefore, there could be an additional short 5' exon that we have not found, or perhaps this exon has degenerated and is now a pseudo-exon.

molecular phylogenetic analysis of deuterostome gata genes
to better define the relationships between all deuterostome gata factors, we conducted a series of molecular phylogenetic analyses. we first analyzed the complete set of the collected gata factors, using the conserved zinc finger domains and aligning newly identified factors to a previously defined alignment  <cit> . these analyses consistently resolved gata <dig> and gata <dig> subfamilies , but could not fully resolve relationships within the gata <dig> and gata <dig> clades. alignments of gata <dig> and gata <dig> full length protein sequences were highly variable and generated results similar to those obtained using the conserved zinc finger domain only .

alignments that compared only gata <dig> or only gata <dig> subfamily members resulted in greater convergence of the gene tree to the species tree . we found that invertebrate gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes formed separate clades outside of the vertebrate gata <dig> and gata <dig> clades, respectively, consistent with the 2r origin of the additional vertebrate gatas. within the individual vertebrate clades, there was a clear separation of tetrapod and teleost genes, and only minor changes to the species tree were observed within these groupings . outside of vertebrates, the cephalochordate gata genes bflogata <dig> and bflogata <dig> group with the ambulacrarian orthologs , but this is likely due to the high degree of conservation and low level of divergence for both the hemichordate and cephalochordate genes.

our results also suggest distinct ancestral relationships within each vertebrate gata class. within the gata <dig> class , a closer relationship was observed between the gata <dig> and gata <dig> members, to the exclusion of a more rapidly evolving gata <dig> group. in contrast to previous results  <cit> , and consistent with other recent results  <cit> , a closer relationship between the gata <dig> and  <dig> groups, to the exclusion of the gata <dig> group, was observed within the gata <dig> class.

in conclusion, these molecular phylogenetic analyses support the presence of two classes of gata factors throughout deuterostomes. deuterostome invertebrates possess single gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes, and the deuterostome gata gene family has expanded in a manner consistent with several rounds of whole genome duplication at the base of the vertebrate lineages. see the discussion for further consideration of these results.

syntenic conserved paralogs and the identification of genome-duplicated gata paralogons
based on the above analysis, we hypothesize that  the last common ancestor to all deuterostomes had one gata <dig> gene and one gata <dig> gene within its genome, and  multiple rounds of whole genome duplication account for the expansion of vertebrate and teleost gata genes. if this hypothesis is correct, then we should be able to detect duplicated gata paralogons–conserved, syntenic paralogs associated with the corresponding paralogous gata loci–within the vertebrate evolutionary lineage. to test this prediction, we characterized the adjacent genomic regions for each vertebrate gata locus, searching for examples of tightly linked loci that have been duplicated together as a result of whole chromosome duplications. although a superficial analysis of conserved synteny has been published  <cit> , which describes a 'segregation' of vertebrate gata genes on multiple chromosomes, we now describe deeper syntenies of orthologs across species and paralogs within species, and use this to completely describe the paralogons and their context during genome duplication events.

in support of gata gene family expansion via genome duplication, we found numerous gene families with conserved synteny across the gata loci. we first described genes syntenic with gata <dig> and gata <dig> loci across each of the vertebrate species . this data was used to identify gene families with paralogs syntenic in multiple gata loci in fish and/or tetrapod species . these results allowed us to define the predicted gata paralogons within each vertebrate genome. overall, thirteen ohnologous gene families were identified as shared between at least two of the four paralogous gata1/2/ <dig> regions . likewise five gene families are shared between the paralogous gata 4/5/ <dig> regions . thus, all vertebrate gata genes are located within extensive paralogons providing strong support for an origin of the vertebrate gata gene complement by whole genome duplication events from two ancestral gata loci, one gata <dig> gene and one gata <dig> gene.

by comparing the differential pattern of gene loss versus gain between the gata paralogons within and among these vertebrate species, we infer the evolutionary birth order of the gata paralogons by determining the most parsimonious pattern of ohnolog retention . in this analysis, we describe clade-specific conserved losses of duplicated paralogs, though it is also formally possible that these 'losses' may represent the translocation of a pre-duplication gene into or out of a paralogon prior to a gene duplication event. nevertheless, all cases are phylogenetically informative.

for the gata <dig> family , we conclude that the initial 1r duplication of the ancestral gata <dig> paralogon generated a gata1/1-ogm  and a gata2/ <dig> paralogon, and was followed by seven subsequent paralogous gene losses. the gata1/1-ogm paralogon lost four ohnologs, whereas the gata2/ <dig> paralogon lost three ohnologs . furthermore, within the gata2/ <dig> paralogon the itih gene apparently underwent a tandem local duplication, before the 2r duplication, resulting in the itih1/2/ <dig> genes and the itih4/ <dig> genes. following the 2r duplication, the gata <dig> paralogon duplicated to generate two distinct paralogons, gata <dig> and gata1-ogm , while the gata2/ <dig> paralogon gave rise to the distinct gata <dig> and gata <dig> paralogon. after the 2r duplication of both gata1/1b and gata2/ <dig> paralogons, only seven paralogous gene losses are required to explain the inferred composition of the four resulting ancestral vertebrate gata <dig> paralogons. according to our scenario, the gata <dig> paralogon lost one ohnolog, the gata1-ogm paralogon lost three ohnologs , the gata <dig> paralogon lost three ohnologs, and the gata <dig> paralogon lost none.

for the gata <dig> family, we propose that the initial 1r duplication generated a gata5/ <dig> paralogon and a gata4/4-ogm paralogon . this 1r duplication was followed by a severe reduction of the gata4/4-ogm paralogon resulting in a minimum of three gene losses within this paralogon. in contrast, no gene losses occurred within the 1r gata5/ <dig> paralogon. we speculate, that subsequently the 2r duplication generated the gata <dig> and gata <dig> paralogons, and the relatively diminished gata <dig> and gata4-ogm paralogons. due to the extensive loss of ohnologs in the latter two, we have been unable to identify a paralogous region representing the gata4-ogm paralogon. however, our current analysis indicates that one ohnolog is missing from the gata <dig> paralogon, and one ohnolog is missing from the gata <dig> paralogon, with each of these two ohnologous genes being retained within the gata <dig> paralogon. in contrast three pairs of ohnologs are shared between gata <dig> and gata <dig> paralogons.

discussion
invertebrate deuterostomes genomes encode sole gata <dig> and gata <dig> orthologs
to examine the evolution of gata transcription factors in deuterostomes, including vertebrates, we searched for and identified single-copy gata <dig> and gata <dig> orthologs in two basal deuterostomes, the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae and the hemichordate saccoglossus kowalevskii. single-copy gata <dig> and gata <dig> orthologs have also been identified in two other basal deuterostomes, the echinoderm strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the urochordate ciona intestinalis. however, the b. floridae and s. kowalevskii genes are more conserved in sequence compared to the previously described invertebrate deuterostome gata genes. this conservation includes near complete sets of gata <dig> and gata <dig> class specific sequence motifs  <cit> , and conserved intron/exon boundaries in the gene regions that encode these motifs. our findings confirm previous phylogenetic inferences that the genome of the last common ancestor to all deuterostomes, like the bilaterian ancestor, encoded one gata <dig> and one gata <dig> transcription factor, with subsequent duplications giving rise to the multiple family members present in vertebrate deuterostome genomes.

reconstructing the ancestral exon/intron structure and evolution of the gata gene
by comparing the exon/intron structures of deuterostome gata genes, we can infer the structure of the ancestral deuterostome  gata orthologs, as well as the ancestral eumetazoan  ortholog. all three of these genes contained a conserved dual-zinc finger domain encoded in three central exons, which encode the first zinc finger, second zinc finger, and a lysine-rich region. however, the 3' and 5' regions appear to vary among these genes. we infer that both the emgata and the udgata <dig> genes included a single 5' exon to this conserved domain, while the udgata <dig> gene contained two 5' exons. as conserved sequence motifs can be identified within the two 5' exons of the gata <dig> genes, and also within the single 5'exon of the sole nematostella gata gene, we infer that the 5' region of the udgata <dig> gene gained an additional intron.

although the 5' exon-intron structure of udgata <dig> is more similar to the nvecgata exon/intron structure, the 3' end of gata <dig> orthologs exhibits more variable features. both the nvecgata and the gata <dig> genes terminate with the third exon of the conserved domain, while gata <dig> orthologs contain a truncated third conserved domain exon as well as one or more novel 3' exon. this third-conserved domain exon encodes ~ <dig> conserved amino acids of a lysine rich region. however, the gata <dig> and nvecgata genes encode a less-conserved terminal end with two c-terminal motifs. in comparison, this lysine-rich exon is shorter in gata <dig> orthologs than in the gata <dig> or nvecgata genes, and lacks c-terminal sequence motifs. furthermore, gata <dig> genes contain novel exon 3' to the conserved domain, and we have been unable to identify conserved motifs from this additional region, suggesting that the 3' region has undergone significant evolutionary change in gata <dig> paralogs.

all vertebrate gata <dig> genes have lost the ancestral n-terminal motif n <dig>  which is present within deuterostome invertebrate gata456s, and within the protostome annelid platynereis dumerilii gata <dig> ortholog. a blast search of the human n-terminal region against the nr protein database fails to find this motif in any vertebrate gata transcription factor, suggesting that this motif may have been lost early in vertebrate evolution.

greater sequence conservation of gata <dig> orthologs
comparison of different deuterostome gata genes to the sole cnidarian gata  gene also suggests that gata <dig> genes are more slowly evolving then their gata <dig> counterparts. this can be seen both in the higher percent identity shared between the conserved domains of the deuterostome gata <dig> and nvecgata genes , the high affinity of the bflogata <dig> with the nvecgata, and the total number of common motifs we can identify. perhaps gata <dig> genes are more constrained due to their retention of a deep ancestral function, while the gata <dig> class might be more diverged due to the selection or incorporation of bilaterian or phylum specific roles. this view is consistent with previous comparisons of the gata gene complement in multiple protostome genomes. almost all protostomes possess a single copy, more slowly evolving gata <dig> gene, whereas the gata <dig> genes expanded in many protostomes by sequential tandem duplications and subsequent modifications to their gene structure  <cit> . however, the expression patterns currently described for deuterostome and cnidarian gata factors are not consistent with retention of a deep ancestral function within the gata <dig> class. whereas nvecgata mrna is largely restricted to the endoderm in the cnidarian nematostella  <cit> , with only a small ectodermal expression domain, the vertebrate gata- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are expressed and function mostly within ectodermal tissues and blood, but not in the endoderm  <cit> . however, gata gene expression has not been examined in many cnidarian species, and thus any inference of any ancestral gata function deeper in animal phylogeny than bilaterians is still premature.

expansion of vertebrate gata transcription factor genes during two rounds of whole genome duplications
our previous work and this analysis suggest that the last common ancestor to both protostomes and deuterostomes had single gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes. but these two gata classes have undergone distinct expansions using different mechanisms during the subsequent evolution of different animal phyla. in protostomes, only the gata <dig> class appears to have undergone expansion, at least in part by tandem duplications within individual chromosomes. by contrast, in vertebrates, both the gata <dig> and the gata <dig> family have expanded through the retention of duplicated gata genes that originated during two rounds of whole genome duplication  <cit> . our molecular phylogenetic analysis, and our analysis of conserved syntenic paralogs, both support expansion by whole genome duplication and furthermore suggest a specific evolutionary order for these duplication events .

our molecular phylogenetic analysis of gata <dig> genes  reveals a closer relationship between gata <dig> and gata <dig> orthologs, to the exclusion of a more rapidly evolving gata <dig> group. it is not surprising that the gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes show more affinity to each other, as gata <dig> appears to be a fast-evolving ortholog relative to other vertebrate gatas. nevertheless, these relationships are further supported by the retention of more syntenic paralogs between the gata <dig> and gata <dig> loci, then between the gata <dig> and either gata <dig> or gata <dig> loci. however, the conservation of syntenic paralogs between gata <dig> and either gata <dig> or gata <dig> strongly supports common evolutionary origin of all three from an ancestral gata <dig> paralogon. we therefore conclude that gata2/ <dig> and gata <dig> intermediates were generated after the 1r vertebrate genome duplication, and that one gata <dig> ohnolog  was lost after the 2r duplication.

in contrast to previous results  <cit>  but consistent with other more recent results  <cit> , our molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests a closer relationship between the gata <dig> and  <dig> groups, to the exclusion of the gata <dig> group. however, despite the differing outcomes in previous molecular phylogenetic analyses, our synteny analysis is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis, and further supports a closer relationship between the gata <dig> and  <dig> groups. we conclude that the 1r genome duplication produced gata <dig> and gata5/ <dig> intermediates, and an additional gata4-ohnolog had been lost after the 2r genome duplication.

additional gene duplications in teleosts
we also find evidence for additional teleost-specific ohnologs in the gata <dig> lineage, but not in the gata <dig> lineage corresponding to an additional round of genome duplication at the base of teleost fish. this evidence stems from both overlaying the species phylogeny on the gene phylogeny  to find additional 3r duplicates, but more conclusively from the comparisons of duplicated paralogons. in all, four additional teleost paralogs have been identified, and two of these paralogs clearly resulting from larger chromosomal duplications.

the topology of our molecular phylogenetic analysis  indicates a teleost-wide duplication of the gata <dig> gene into separate gata2a and gata2b genes, most likely originating from the 3r teleost-specific genome duplication event. although the topology of zebrafish gata2b within the tree is slightly off, possibly due to its long branch indicating its derived sequence, the presence of conserved syntenic genes between the tetrapod gata <dig> paralogon and the teleost gata2a and gata2b paralogons strongly suggests that these duplicated via a chromosomal duplication.

the zebrafish genome also contains a second gata <dig> duplicate that appears to originate from the 3r duplication. although only found in zebrafish, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that this gata gene may have resulted from the 3r duplication, and was secondarily lost early in the ancestor of all other teleost. this view is consistent with zebrafish being the most basal member of the fish species represented in this analysis. however, this view is also supported by the presence of two identifiable gata <dig> paralogons within each teleost fish genomes , although the second gata <dig> gene is missing in these additional teleost paralogons with the exception of zebrafish.

although we see no evidence for additional teleost gata <dig> ohnologs from a 3r round of genome duplication, the tetraodon  genome does contain two gata <dig> paralogs. however, the topology of our molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests a more recent origin via a tetraodon-specific gene duplication, as opposed to retained genome duplicate.

our analysis of conserved synteny demonstrates the presence of additional duplicated paralogons, even when a second gata paralog is not identified . therefore, our data based on the comparative analysis of gata paralogons in vertebrates strongly supports a third genome duplication event  at the base of teleost fish.

it is notable that so many  of these gata transcription factors were retained after the first two rounds of genome duplication on the base of the vertebrate branch. in comparison, a recent analysis from the cephalochordate genome could identify retention of genome duplicated paralogs in only about one quarter of all human gene families, with a much smaller fraction containing multiple ohnologs  <cit> . furthermore, only 2/ <dig> ohnologs  were retained after an additional teleost-specific whole genome duplication event. apparently, the integration and preservation of gata transcription factors into the gene regulatory networks was a more probable outcome after the two early rounds of whole genome duplication , and less likely after the third round . in addition, after these early genome duplications at the base of the vertebrate lineage, the gata gene family has remained static in most vertebrate species. after the 2r duplication event, all of the examined tetrapods maintained exactly six gata transcription factor genes. after the teleost-specific 3r genome duplication, only a single gain of a gata <dig> duplicate in tetraodon, and a loss of the gata2b ohnolog in the ancestor of the acanthopterygian fish, has occurred.

the presence of two distinct gata factor classes in basal deuterostomes, and their subsequent expansions in vertebrates, informs the understanding of studies indicating functional redundancy within each gata class. for example interfering with the function of all three gata <dig> orthologs in xenopus laevis embryos results in a much more severe endoderm defect than does an inhibition of the function of only one or two of them. similarly, reducing the function of only one or two gata <dig> paralogs only partially blocks cardiac mesoderm induction in both zebrafish and xenopus  <cit> . the overlapping expression domains in the cns for the gata <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and in hematopoietic lineages for gata <dig> orthologs  <cit>  may suggest that these gata factors also have redundant functions. similarly, the gata <dig> and gata <dig> gene families in nematodes are both highly redundant in their requirements. the use of c. elegans gata <dig> gene duplicates at multiple nodes and levels in an endodermal gene regulatory network provides the furthest understood model so far for retention, cooption, and integration of gene duplicates within a gene network over evolutionary time  <cit> .

while these gene expansions and functional redundancies can complicate studies of gata functions, both the hemichordate and the cephalochordate posses only single copies of each gata factor class. both of these basal deuterostomes also exhibit many widely conserved morphological features that are thought to resemble the ancestral states for both deuterostomes and chordates, respectively . thus these basal deuterostomes are appealing model organisms in which to investigate conserved functions for the gata <dig> and gata <dig> classes of developmental regulatory transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the above molecular phylogenetic analyses, as well as comparisons of conserved intron/exon structure and sequence motifs, demonstrates that the last common ancestor to all deuterostomes had only two gata factor genes, one gata <dig> and one gata <dig> gene, within its genome. these analyses confirm that the gata family of transcription factors has expanded via whole genome duplications in vertebrates. during the 1r and 2r genome duplication, this family expanded to three gata <dig> and three gata <dig> genes that are conserved across vertebrates. the 1r genome duplication gave rise to gata <dig> and gata2/ <dig> paralogs, as well as gata <dig> and gata5/ <dig> paralogs, while single gata ohnologs were lost from the gata <dig> and gata <dig> lineages after the 2r event. in addition, the teleost 3r genome duplication has resulted in  <dig> or  <dig> additional gata <dig> duplicates in fish species. both, our molecular phylogenetic analysis and conserved paralogon analysis are in support of the same birth order and relationships between gata <dig> and gata <dig> subfamilies members.

the identification of single gata <dig> and single gata <dig> orthologs in the more conserved hemichordate and cephalochordate genomes highlights how these basal deuterostomes may provide useful model systems for investigating conserved gata factor requirements without the functional redundancies observed in vertebrates. additionally, although this paper focuses on gata factor gene relationships, our analysis has also identified eighteen other gene families contained within paralogous gene groups. the reconstructed evolutionary history of these vertebrate gata paralogons provides a new basis for understanding the origin and evolution of these paralogous gene families as well.
