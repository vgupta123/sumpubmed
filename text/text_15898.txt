BACKGROUND
the ubiquitous presence of cationic antimicrobial peptides  in virtually all types of cells and organisms ranging from bacterial cells to humans suggests that camps have important conserved roles as defense weapons. camps contribute to the host defense of microbial invasion on epithelial surfaces by killing engulfed micro-organisms in phagocytic cells or modulating inflammatory responses in infections  <cit> . these ancient weapons of host defense are typically amphipathic peptides with a net positive charge at physiological ph and they share well-defined α-helical or β-sheet secondary structures. camps are able to integrate into cell membranes, form membrane-spanning pores and thereby cause lethal cell damage. the positive charge is important for the initial binding of camps to target membranes. there are differences in the way camps interact with membranes and accordingly three different models have been used to define their mode of actions in model membrane systems  <cit> . in the barrel-stave mechanism, peptides integrate into the membrane and form membrane-spanning pores  <cit> . in the toroidal-pore mechanism, camps form membrane-spanning pores together with intercalated lipids  <cit> . and in the carpet mechanism, peptides accumulate on the membrane surface in a carpet-like manner and at a threshold density so that they dissolve the membrane without forming transmembrane channels  <cit> . however, membrane damage is not the only mechanism whereby camps cause cell death. they may also affect functions of several other cell components and act as metabolic inhibitors of cellular processes including biosynthesis of the cell wall, nucleic-acids and proteins  <cit> . in these cases, the cell death can be the result of multiple inhibitory effects.

bacteria have evolved mechanisms to combat the harmful effects of camps  <cit> . on the other hand, the antimicrobial peptide repertoire in host cells may have co-evolved with the evolution of microbial resistance mechanisms. this is exemplified by the skin of the frog rana temporaria in which some temporins act in a synergistic manner to overcome the resistance of gram-negative bacteria imposed by the lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . the high resistance of staphylococcus aureus to camps produced by human cells may contribute to epithelial colonization and resistance to destruction by neutrophils. several mechanisms conferring increased resistance to camps have been identified. the modulation of the density of negative charge in the cell wall by d-alanylation of teichoic acids  or on the outer surface of the cell membrane by l-lysinylation of phosphatidylglycerol  has been shown to contribute to camp resistance in s. aureus  <cit>  as well as in several other bacteria  <cit> . in gram-negative bacteria, lps modifications modulate cell envelope charge and polymyxin susceptibility  <cit> . many bacteria species produce proteases which cleave antimicrobial peptides, particularly linear ones  <cit> . s. aureus aureolysin and v <dig> as well as proteases secreted by bacillus anthracis are examples of proteases capable of cleaving the human cathelicidin ll- <dig>  <cit> . the camp resistance mechanisms also include camp-binding proteins and camp efflux pumps  <cit> .

bacterial sensory systems are capable of recognizing cationic antimicrobial peptides and to respond to their presence by up-regulation of general stress systems as well as more specific camp resistance mechanisms. in salmonella typhimurium binding of camps to the phoq two-component sensor kinase activates the signal transduction cascade from the sensor to the phoq response regulator, resulting consequently in the induction of the phopq-regulated promoters  <cit> . a complex stress response was observed when bacillus subtilis was exposed to camps, including activation of the sigw and sigm extracytoplasmic sigma factors and the yxdjk and liars two-component systems  <cit> . in this study, our purpose was to characterize the stress response of s. aureus treated with cationic antimicrobial peptides by using whole-genome oligoarrays. the effects of three different α-helical camps on the transcriptome of the s. aureus newman strain were analyzed: temporin l, ovispirin- <dig> and dermaseptin k4-s <dig>  these peptides are synthesized as preproproteins  and the mature microbicidal peptides are formed after proteolytic cleavage of the pre-  and pro-regions of the precursors  <cit> . ovispirin- <dig> is a derivative of the cathelicidin smap- <dig> found in sheep  <cit> . the other two peptides, dermaseptin k4-s <dig>  which is a truncated derivative of the dermaseptin s <dig>  and temporin l, are both expressed in amphibian skin  <cit> . temporin l belongs to pore-forming peptides   <cit>  and ovispirin- <dig> and dermaseptin disrupt lipid bilayers by the carpet mechanism  <cit> . we used these well-characterized peptides of animal origin as models of cationic antimicrobial peptides and expected that studying their interactions with s. aureus would give information that was more generally applicable also to human camps. we aimed to identify the camp stimulons and to determine whether the differentially expressed genes play a role in camp resistance. furthermore, we were interested to find out whether there are strong peptide-specific responses or a more general stress response triggered by camps exposition, to explore the mode of action of camps and to improve our understanding of the resistance mechanisms against camps.

RESULTS
the vrasr cell wall regulon, vrade, sa <dig> and sas <dig> are strongly induced by cationic antimicrobial peptides
exponentially growing s. aureus cells were treated with c-terminally amidated temporin l , ovispirin- <dig>  or dermaseptin k4-s <dig> -nh2) at sublethal concentrations  which slightly inhibited growth but did not stop it. gene expression changes in the camp-treated cells as compared to non-treated cells were analyzed by using whole-genome oligoarrays.

all three peptides upregulated a large number of genes  and most of them were induced by more than one peptide. table  <dig> shows a set of the genes induced by at least one of the peptides at least 3-fold and represents a list of "marker" genes for the camp stimulon. the complete list of the induced genes  is shown in additional file  <dig>  the microarray data sets have been deposited in the geo database   <cit> .

*: only the most strongly upregulated genes, the marker genes of the camp stimulon, are shown in this table. the complete list of genes induced at least 2-fold by several camps is shown in additional file  <dig>  in the case of operons, only the first gene or the most strongly induced gene is shown;

**: t, temporin l-nh2; o, ovispirin-1-nh2; d, dermaseptin k4-s4-nh2;

camps induced the expression of the vrasr two-component system and consequently almost the whole vrasr regulon  <cit>  was upregulated. in addition to the three antimicrobial peptides of animal origin, we also recently found that the human cathelicidin ll- <dig> induces the vrasr regulon . among the most strongly induced genes were vrade, sa <dig> and sas <dig>  which encode an abc-type transporter similar to a putative bacitracin efflux pump  <cit> , a lysostaphin-like cell-wall peptidase and a functionally-unknown peptide of  <dig> amino acids, respectively. the antimicrobial peptide treatment caused stress that induced general stress genes such as the ctsr-clpc operon, groels and dnajk. the synthesis of cell components involved in combating oxidative stress, catalase , a putative thioredoxin  and thioredoxin reductases , were also among the induced genes. furthermore, a feature of the transcriptome was upregulation of several amino acid-biosynthesis operons .

genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism or encoding virulence factors were down-regulated in camp-treated cells
there were also down-regulated genes in the transcriptomes. temporin l-nh <dig>  ovispirin-1-nh <dig> and dermaseptin k4-s4-nh <dig> decreased the expression of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. most of the genes were down-regulated by more than one peptide . notably, all three peptides had a strong inhibitory effect on the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . the genes encoding enzymes for nitrate respiration  and fermentation  were strongly repressed. another striking phenomenon is that antimicrobial peptides caused down-regulation of several virulence factors and their regulators . among the down-regulated virulence factor genes were hld, ssaa, sbi, hlga, ssl <dig> , clfa, clfb and spa. the negative effect was particularly strong on the expression of hld, ssl <dig>  clfa and clfb in cells treated with ovispirin-1-nh <dig> 

qrt-pcr measurements of the differentially expressed genes
we used qrt-pcr to verify some of the most interesting gene expression responses. the most strongly upregulated genes of the transcriptome,vrad , sa <dig> and sas <dig> were subjected to qrt-pcr. the activity of the vrasr regulon was determined with three genes, vras , prsa  and sa <dig>  the dna microarray data suggested that an operon encoding a putative pstb-like phosphate uptake system  was induced by ovispirin-1-nh <dig> and dermaseptin k4-s4-nh <dig> but not by temporin l-nh <dig> . this induction pattern suggests that the peptide-induced expression from the promoter of the sa1217-sa <dig> operon may depend on the mode of action of the antimicrobial peptides and we therefore were interested in confirming the peptide-specific induction pattern by qrt-pcr. we determined the expression level of sa <dig>  we also determined two further genes, vraf  and dlta , which were induced about 2-fold in the microarrays only by ovispirin-1-nh <dig>  the ortholog of vraf in b. subtilis is bcea, which encodes the atpase component of an abc transporter. since bcea is strongly induced by bacitracin  <cit>  and moderately by linear cationic antimicrobial peptides  <cit> , and since it is also important for bacitracin resistance, we were interested in determining whether vraf is induced in the camp-treated cells of s. aureus. furthermore, vrade, vrafg and the dlt operon are all regulated by the aps  sensory system  <cit> . the dlt operon encodes proteins which modify wall teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids with d-alanine and thereby modulate the cell wall charge  <cit> . the density of negative charge in the wall affects the sensitivity of the bacteria to camps.

the gene expression changes of the induced genes were clearly higher in the qrt-pcr measurements than in the dna microarray, a previously described characteristic  <cit> , but overall consistency was found in the results. the sas <dig>  vrad, sa <dig>  sa <dig> and prsa genes exhibited the strongest gene induction responses; over 100-fold induction of sas <dig> and vrad was observed with ovispirin-1-nh <dig> . most of the genes responded more strongly to ovispirin-1-nh <dig> than temporin-l-nh <dig>  this was particularly clear in the induction of vrad and sa <dig>  but also vraf, dlta, prsa, sas <dig> and sa <dig> responded in this manner. sa <dig> was the only gene which was expressed at higher levels in temporin-l-nh2-treated cells as compared to ovispirin-1-nh2-treated cells. the gene expression responses to dermaseptin k4-s4-nh <dig> were in most cases similar to those of ovispirin-1-nh <dig> 

the negative effect of camps on the expression of ssaa, sbi and sa <dig> was verified by qrt-pcr. consistently with the microarray results, these genes were down-regulated in cells treated with the peptides . however, the decrease in expression was clearly lower in the qrt-pcr measurements.

the amide at the c-terminus of ovispirin- <dig> is crucial for the high level induction of vrade
the three peptides used in the dna microarray analysis were modified with c-terminal amide groups. we studied whether the amide affects gene induction by comparing the induction levels of four key genes in cells treated with amide-modified or non-modified ovispirin- <dig> or amide-modified temporin l. the determined genes were groel, a general stress gene, prsa, the activity of which reflects the activity of the vrasr two-component system and the severity of the stress in the cell wall  <cit> , and sa <dig> and vrad, which were strongly induced by camps. we also determined how other types of antimicrobial agents induce these genes. the antimicrobial agents were vancomycin and teicoplanin, which inhibit cell wall biosynthesis by interacting with the lipid ii peptidoglycan precursor  <cit> , bacitracin, an antimicrobial agent which interferes with the dephosphorylation of the peptidoglycan precursor  <cit> , and daptomycin, a lipopeptide antibiotic with a specific mode of action on the cell membrane  <cit> . furthermore, a pentaglycin peptide, akgggggak, which mimics the peptide cross-link of s. aureus peptidoglycan, was tested to see whether a native cell wall peptide induces the expression of the four genes. this peptide was not antimicrobial at the concentration used,  <dig> μg/ml.

the results revealed that the c-terminal amide strongly influenced the induction of vrad by ovispirin- <dig>  in the absence of the amide, vrad was only induced  <dig> -fold . in contrast, when ovispirin- <dig> was modified with the amide, vrad was induced 136-fold. the mic values of both of the ovispirin- <dig> peptides for the s. aureus newman strain were  <dig> μg/ml , indicating that a difference in the stability of the peptides does not explain the large difference  in the induction levels. the amide-modified peptide was also a better inducer of sa <dig>  prsa and groel, but the difference was much smaller, only 2-4-fold. the induction pattern of the cell wall antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin was similar to that of ovispirin- <dig> without the c-terminal amide: the induction levels of sa <dig> and prsa were clearly higher than those of vrad and groel. the vrad expression was also strongly induced by bacitracin, almost 500-fold, whereas the induction levels of sa <dig> and prsa were much lower, 30-50-fold. thus the induction pattern was similar to the amide-modified ovispirin- <dig>  in contrast, temporin l-nh <dig>  despite the c-terminal amide and lower mic than ovispirin-1-nh <dig>  was a poor inducer of vrad  and resembled in this respect the non-modified ovispirin- <dig> and the cell wall antibiotics. the pentaglycine peptide did not induce any of the four genes.

vrade is an abc transporter system dedicated to resist bacitracin, whereas vrasr two-component system affects the resistance against a wider spectrum of antimicrobial agents
our experiments showed that the vrade abc transporter and the vrasr two-component system are two camp-inducible systems which could be important for bacterial cells in resisting the harmful effects of camps and possibly other antimicrobial agents. in order to study this, we constructed vrade and vrasr null mutants and cultivated the mutants and the parental s. aureus newman strain in mueller-hinton broth in the presence of various concentrations of the antimicrobials  and determined their mic values . the camps used in the susceptibility tests were, ovispirin-1-nh <dig>  ovispirin- <dig>  temporin l-nh <dig>  two lantibiotics nisin and pep <dig>  human cathelicidin ll- <dig>  and hbd <dig> defensin . in addition, we determined mics for vancomycin, teicoplanin, bacitracin and daptomycin.

the mutations were verified by pcr , but also the expression of the vrad, sa <dig>  prsa and groel genes in the vrade and vrasr null mutants exposed to vancomycin was determined by qrt-pcr. the Δvrade mutant did not express vrad mrna, consistent with the mutation . the sa <dig>  prsa and groel genes were expressed at about the same level as in the wild-type, 3-60-fold induction . in the Δvrasr mutant, sa <dig> and prsa were expressed at a low level  consistent with the vrasr defect and suggesting that not only prsa but also sa <dig> belong to the vrasr regulon. their induction at a low level in the absence of vrasr may indicate that the expression is also controlled by another sensory system.

the Δvrade mutant was clearly more sensitive than the wild-type strains to bacitracin , but no other differences were observed in the antimicrobial sensitivities. this strongly suggests that vrade is a bacitracin-specific detoxification pump. more differences were observed with the Δvrasr mutant. it exhibited increased sensitivity to teicoplanin , bacitracin  and ovispirin-1-nh <dig> . the Δvrasr mutation did not affect the sensitivity to ovispirin- <dig>  nisin, daptomycin, pep <dig>  ll- <dig> or hbd <dig>  the same mutations in another s. aureus strain  caused similar antimicrobial sensitivity differences, indicating that they are not strain specific .

in order to characterize further the phenotypes of the vrade and vrasr null mutants, we subjected them to phenotype microarray  analysis . the analysis was performed with the pm11- <dig> sensitivity plates, which allow the testing of  <dig> phenotypes and the identification of increased or decreased sensitivities of the mutants as compared to the wild-type reference strain to a wide variety of non-peptide antimicrobial agents. phenotype microarray analysis measures the reduction of tetrazolium dye .

the Δvrasr mutant was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to a number of cell wall-active antibiotics including several cephalosporins . this result is consistent with a similar result of a previous study on a vrasr null mutant of s. aureus n <dig>  <cit> . the pm assay also suggested enhanced sensitivity to some other antimicrobial compounds than antibiotics. we verified the growth inhibitory effects of four of these antimicrobials, cefotaxime, chlorpromazine, egta and sodium tungstate, by cultivating the Δvrasr mutant and the wild-type s. aureus newman strain in bhi medium on microtiter plates containing  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig> mm concentrations of these antimicrobials, respectively, and measuring the optical densities of the cultures. the Δvrasr mutant was unable to grow in the presence of these antimicrobials, while the wild-type strain grew significantly . in addition to these major differences of sensitivity, several minor differences were also observed, but we did not verify them in microtiter plate cultures by optical density measurements. the vrasr null mutant was resistant to macrolide antibiotics due to the ery gene used in the mutant construction. the pm analysis of the Δvrade mutant did not reveal any significant sensitivity differences , suggesting again a dedicated role for vrade in bacitracin resistance.

discussion
a prominent feature of the camp transcriptomes of s. aureus newman was the induction of the vrasr regulon. the regulon consists of several genes involved in cell wall-associated functions such as protein quality control, protein folding and modulation of cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . the induction pattern of the vrasr-regulated genes was very similar to that observed with vancomycin-treated cells in another transcription profiling study with another s. aureus strain, n <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the effects on membranes, several antimicrobial peptides such as nisin, mersacidin and bacitracin inhibit cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . whether the vrasr-inducing linear camps used in this study inhibit cell wall biosynthesis and cause a cell wall defect cannot be judged from our data, but this is the most likely explanation for the similar induction patterns of the vrasr-regulated genes. a transcription profiling study with a lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin also showed up-regulation of the the vrasr cell wall regulon  <cit> , which is probably caused by an inhibitory effect on the cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> , although the results furthermore suggested that some of the up-regulated genes in the daptomycin transcriptome were induced by its membrane depolarization effect  <cit> . a similar dual effect has also been shown with human β-defensin  <dig>  <cit> .

in b. subtilis, the yxdlm operon, which encodes an abc transporter, is strongly induced by human cathelicidin ll- <dig> in a manner dependent on the yxdjk two-component system, but not at all by porcine protegrin pg- <dig> and a model antimicrobial peptide poly-l-lysine  <cit> . this indicates that antimicrobial peptides can be very specific in activating stress sensors and the activation mechanism may even be dependent on the mode of action, charge or structural properties of the peptides. in this study we found that the vrade ones were the most strongly induced genes in cells treated with ovispirin-1-nh <dig> or dermaseptin k4-s4-nh <dig>  we could demonstrate that the high level of induction of vrade with ovispirin-1-nh <dig> was dependent on the amide group at the c-terminus. the antimicrobial effects of these two variants of ovispirin- <dig> on wild-type s. aureus newman strain were not different. the expression regulation of vrade is under the control of the aps  sensor system, which also controls the expression of vrafg, encoding a putative peptide efflux pump, dlt operon, encoding components responsible for the d-alanylation of teichoic acids and modulation of the net negative charge of the cell wall, and mprf, encoding the mprf enzyme which catalyzes the lysinylation of phosphatidylglycerol and modulates the charge of the outer surface of the cell membrane  <cit> . it has been shown that a nine-aminoacid loop of the apss sensor exposed on the outer surface of the membrane interacts with camps when activating the sensor  <cit> . our results suggest that in linear peptides the c-terminal amide group is an important element for the activation of the apss sensor. in the study by li and collaborators  <cit>  the peptides which naturally contain an amide group at the c-terminus, indolicidin and melittin, were significantly better inducers of the dltb gene than those that do not have the amide such as magainin ii and nisin. the vrade genes were also the most strongly induced genes in the stress response to c-terminally amide-modified human cathelicidin ll- <dig> . however, the low level of induction of vrade with temporin l-nh <dig> in this study suggests that the c-terminal amide is not the only element that is recognized by the apss sensor and needed for the induction. alternatively, the level of the induction of the aps regulon might rather depend on the absence of the carboxyl group than on the presence of the amide. mersacidin, which is a lantibiotic, but unlike nisin, does not have a free c-terminal carboxyl group due to an intramolecular thioether-ethyleneamide bridge, is a very strong inducer of vrade  <cit>  and might fit this model.

vrade is a transporter system that is dedicated to resist bacitracin, as evidenced in this study by the testing the sensitivity of the vrade null mutant to  <dig> antimicrobial peptides or antibiotics and numerous other antimicrobial agents . the Δvrade mutant was more susceptible to bacitracin but not to any other antimicrobial tested. consistently, vrade is similar to the bceab bacitracin transport system of b. subtilis  <cit>  and probably comprise together with vrafg an efflux pump system for combating bacitracin  <cit> . a recent study suggested that in b. subtilis bacitracin sensing and the expression of the bceab genes are dependent on active bacitracin transport via bceab and that the large periplasmic loop of the bcea permease component of the transporter may be involved in mediating the signal to the bcers two-component system  <cit> . we found that bacitracin is a strong inducer of vrade expression. whether the sensing mechanism of aps is dependent on the transport function of vrade or vrafg, whether aps senses linear camps and bacitracin in a similar manner and whether the amide group of the side chain of glutamine in the cyclic bacitracin peptide  <cit>  have a similar essential role in the activation, should be addressed in future studies. the c-terminal amide being in a sequence contex that is appropriate for the interaction with the sensory loop of apss most probably explains the differences in the induction patterns of the vrade, vraf and dlta genes observed in this study. however, we can not rule out the possibility that the carpet-mode of action mechanism influences the induction, since the amide-modified carpet peptides ovispirin-1-nh <dig> and dermaseptin k4-s4-nh <dig> were clearly stronger inducers of these genes than the amide-modified toroidal pore-forming peptide temporin l-nh <dig> 

in addition to vrade, sa <dig> was strongly induced by camps, but in this case the strongest inducer was temporin l-nh <dig>  our results indicated that sa <dig>  which encodes a putative cell membrane-associated peptidase, belongs to the vrasr regulon. the over 100-fold induced  sas <dig> encodes a small protein with unknown function and mechanism of regulation. it was also strongly induced by vancomycin  <cit> , suggesting that it responds to a cell wall defect. furthermore, it was detected at both transcript and protein levels in gisa strains  <cit> . s. aureus cells try to adapt to the stress and harmful effects of camps by inducing or repressing several gene systems. these responses include the induction of the ctsr, dnaj, dnak, hrca, groel and groes general stress genes and genes resisting oxidative stress . some of these targets showed similar inductions in s. aureus during phagocytosis by neutrophils or when surviving within epithelial and phagocytic cells  <cit> . notably, several amino acid biosynthesis operons and genes encoding enzymes of the citric acid cycle were also induced and genes involved in anaerobic metabolism were repressed, indicating that the cells were metabolically active and respiring aerobically. the down-regulation of virulence gene expression is partly caused by the repression of saers, but also the decreased expression of the agr operon affects their low expression.

s. aureus is a human pathogen and it can be argued that the camps of animal origin may cause a different kind of transcriptional response than camps of the natural host. a transcriptional analysis of responses of s. aureus  to human β-defensin  <dig>  showed that vrade, vrasr and sa <dig> were also induced by this human camp  <cit> , as was the case with the animal camps in this study. the most notable difference in the transcriptomes is the very strong induction of the sa <dig> gene, which encodes a protein similar to abc transporter atp-binding proteins, in sg <dig> cells exposed to hbd <dig>  since this gene is absent in the genome of the s. aureus newman strain, it is not among the induced genes of this study. sass and collaborators recently showed that a knockout mutation of vrae increases the susceptibility of s. aureus sg <dig> also to other antibiotics than bacitracin, including antimicrobial peptides hbd <dig>  ll- <dig>  pep <dig> and nisin  <cit> . the defective grars/aps sensory system of the strain sg <dig>  <cit>  may explain the inconsistency with the result of this study.

the Δvrasr mutant exhibited enhanced sensitivity to several antimicrobial agents as compared to the wild-type strains. they were more sensitive to the amide-modified ovispirin- <dig> but not to the non-modified one. ovispirin-1-nh <dig> was a better activator of aps and vrasr than ovispirin- <dig> and this may explain the higher resistance of the wild-type strain to the amide-modified peptide. the Δvrasr mutation also decreased the mic values of bacitracin and teicoplanin. this effect is similar to what has been observed with a Δvrasr mutant of s. aureus n <dig>  <cit> . our phenotype microarray analysis revealed increased sensitivity of the s. aureus newman Δvrasr mutant to a wide range of β-lactam antibiotics. furthermore, we showed that Δvrasr increased susceptibility to other types of antimicrobial agents such as egta and phenothiazines. since egta is a metal-chelator, it probably harmfully affects bacterial cells and particularly severely Δvrasr mutant cell by binding to divalent metal cations in the cell wall and consequently causing metal sequestration. the phenothiazines chlorpromazine and thioridazine, which are or have been used in psychiatric therapy, are potential lead compounds for the development of new cell wall-active antibiotics. it has been shown that the dosage of chlorpromazine used in psychiatry results in intracellular concentrations of this drug that are antimicrobial  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the current rapid increase in antibiotic resistance among human pathogens coincides dangerously with a lack of novel antibiotic discovery. a promising alternative is a class of short peptides known as antimicrobial peptides, or host defense peptides, which are found among all classes of life but have yet to be widely exploited for pharmaceutical purposes. in order to identify the inducible resistance mechanism of staphylococcus aureus against antimicrobial peptides and other antimicrobial agents, the bacterium was exposed to antimicrobial peptides and gene expression changes were analyzed. the analysis revealed similar gene induction patterns with cell wall-active antibiotics but also some distinctly different ones. the induction of the vrasr regulon suggests that antimicrobial peptides have an inhibitory effect on the cell wall biosynthesis. this must be verified biochemically in future studies. parts of the signalling pathways are not specifically dedicated to camp defense but are regulated following the lifestyle of pathogenic bacteria which are potentially exposed to a wide diversity of environmental changes.

this study does not provide a definitive answer as to whether the mode of action of camps on lipid bylayers is responsible for certain induction patterns, but this is a potential alternative. for instance in the case of the induction of the sa1217-sa <dig> operon, the carpet-forming peptides ovispirin-1-nh <dig> or dermaseptin k4-s4-nh <dig> were strong inducers whereas the pore-forming peptide temporin l-nh <dig> was unable to induce this operon. most importantly, it was found that modifying the carboxy-terminus of a linear peptide with an amide group can modulate drastically its properties as an inducer of resistance mechanisms. this result may allow the rational design of antimicrobial agents that lack the properties to induce resistance mechanisms. inactivating the vrasr cell wall stress management system increased susceptibility of the bacterium to a wide range of cell wall-active antibiotics but also susceptibility to several non-antibiotic antimicrobials was increased. particularly interesting in the latter group are the established antipsychotic drugs, chlorpromazine and thioridazine, which are potential lead molecules for developing novel antibiotics.
