BACKGROUND
q fever, caused by the bacterium coxiella burnetii, has been a public health problem in the netherlands between  <dig> and 2010
 <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig>  before the first documented q fever outbreak in the netherlands, c. burnetii related abortions were reported on a number of commercial dairy goat farms in a rural area in the southeast of the netherlands
 <cit> . in  <dig>  a q fever outbreak was reported in humans in the same rural area, which expanded to other areas in the netherlands in subsequent years
 <cit> . the  <dig> outbreak initiated source-finding investigations in the affected areas during the subsequent epidemics in  <dig> and  <dig>  the investigations were initiated by several municipal health services, in close collaboration with the netherlands food and consumer product safety authority  and the national institute for public health and the environment . vaginal swabs from goats and sheep and surface swabs from stables, that were obtained during these source-finding studies, revealed that c. burnetii dna is present on most dairy farms suspected of being a source for human q fever cases in their vicinity
 <cit> . in addition, epidemiological studies indicated commercial dairy goat farms as most likely sources for human q fever infection in the netherlands
 <cit> . genotyping of c. burnetii dna obtained from human, animal and environmental samples could yield further insight in the possible link between the  human q fever cases and c. burnetii positive farms. to enable such studies, genotypic characterization of c. burnetii strains circulating in the different reservoirs is needed.

a number of different molecular typing methods have been developed to analyze genetic variability among c. burnetii laboratory isolates. one of the first molecular typing methods for c. burnetii is based on restriction fragment length polymorphism  in combination with pulse field gel electrophoresis 
 <cit> . more recently, pcr based methods were developed for molecular typing of c. burnetii strains, including multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis 
 <cit> , multispacer sequence typing 
 <cit> , and single nucleotide polymorphism 
 <cit> . previous studies of c. burnetii genotypes during the epidemics in the netherlands showed low genetic diversity, and domination by one genotype in human and animal samples
 <cit> . in this study, we expand these analyses by investigating environmental samples, which are thought to play an important role in transmission of c. burnetii from animals to humans. we investigated farms that have been identified as potential sources for human q fever in the netherlands. moreover, we included regions in the netherlands that had not been studied previously.

RESULTS
the selection of samples for molecular typing using mlva was based on qpcr assays that have been used for the detection of c. burnetii in several studies
 <cit> . dna extracts showing cq values of  <dig> or lower for c. burnetii target is <dig> in qpcr assays, were selected for molecular typing using a newly developed multiplex mlva assay. attempts to amplify dna from samples with higher cq values  were unsuccessful. characteristics of the two developed multiplex mlva pcr assays are described in table
 <dig> 

per assay, three different primer sets, labeled with different fluorescent dyes, target three different loci. loci are indicated by their previously published names: ms
 <cit> , and cox
 <cit> . the sequencing primer sets were used for sequencing mlva motifs.

the numbers of tandem repeats calculated from pcr fragment sizes obtained for each locus were confirmed by sequencing . significant discrepancies between sequencing results and pcr fragment sizes were found for markers ms <dig> and ms <dig>  for these markers, the number of repeats that was calculated based on pcr fragment sizes was approximately one repeat lower than the number obtained from sequencing. in addition, for markers ms <dig> and ms <dig> one of the repeats that was included in the repeat count was not located immediately adjacent to the other repeats. repeat numbers thus calculated are in accordance with the number of tandem repeats identified for the c. burnetii nine mile rsa  <dig> phase i strain in other studies
 <cit> . therefore, sequencing results guided correct estimations of the numbers of tandem repeats in the mlva genotyping of our samples.

1the numbers of tandem repeats from fragment sizes were calculated by dividing the sizes of the measured pcr products minus primer binding sites and flanking regions by the corresponding repeat length.

a total of  <dig> samples , originating from  <dig> farm locations were successfully genotyped. based on six markers, a total of six different mlva genotypes  could be discriminated . overall, the most common c. burnetii type observed in all samples was mlva genotype a, followed by genotype b, genotype e, genotype d, genotype f, and genotype c. the number of mlva genotypes per animal or environmental matrix and farm type is presented in table
 <dig>  the most abundant genotype a was found in all animal and environmental matrices. genotype b was observed in vaginal swabs and surface swabs, while genotypes c and d were observed in vaginal swabs from goats only. genotype e was found in spleens from rats, but not in any of the animal samples obtained from goats or sheep. genotype f was observed in surface swabs of a single dairy sheep farm only.

samples were obtained from  <dig> dairy goat farms,  <dig>  sheep, one cattle farm, and one petting zoo. the number of farms on which the samples were collected is displayed between brackets.

on most farms, only one single c. burnetii mlva genotype was detected. genotype a was encountered as a single genotype on most farms , genotype b was the single genotype on two farms, and genotypes c, d, e and f were single genotypes on four farms . on three farms, additional mlva genotypes were encountered besides the most common genotype a. on farm  <dig>  mlva genotypes a and b were observed in separate vaginal swab samples, while type b was the only genotype in surface swabs. on farm  <dig>  mlva type a was observed in milk filters, while mlva type b was observed in surface swabs. on farm  <dig>  both mlva genotypes a and e were observed as mixed genotypes in milk filters and surface swabs.

discussion
the q fever outbreak of  <dig> was the first documented outbreak in the netherlands. a case control study in  <dig> revealed several risk factors for acquiring q fever, however, a direct link with a particular source could not be established
 <cit> . in this study we show that the most common mlva genotype in both animal and environmental samples obtained from  <dig> farm locations is mlva genotype a. the environmental sampling categories, surface swabs and aerosols, are of particular interest for establishing a source hypothesis of c. burnetii infection, since they may provide the link between c. burnetii in animals and humans. coxiella burnetii laden dust can originate from the decomposition of c. burnetii contaminated aerosols and vice versa, re-aerosolisation of contaminated dust might occur. contaminated aerosols are regarded as one of the most important transmission routes for c. burnetii to humans, especially when environmental conditions for aerosol dispersion are favourable
 <cit> . surface swabs were collected on  <dig> out of the  <dig> sampling locations and showed the occurrence of mlva genotype a at  <dig> of these locations. two aerosol samples collected at two of these locations were suitable for typing and mlva genotype a was observed in these samples as well. as mlva genotype a was also the dominant genotype in animal samples obtained from goats, sheep, and rats , these data show that the most common genotype can be detected in both the animal hosts and the environmental matrices that are considered to play a dominant role in the direct or indirect transmission from animals to humans.

the finding of a single most common c. burnetii mlva genotype in both environmental and animal samples in this study, supports the findings of two other mlva genotyping studies in the netherlands
 <cit> . the  <dig> clinical samples that were successfully typed by tilburg et al. <cit>  using a panel of six mlva markers, revealed a most common mlva type referred to as mlva genotype g . the four mlva markers  that can be compared to our study showed tandem repeats numbers that were identical to our most common mlva genotype a. the most common mlva genotype in the veterinary study by roest et al. <cit>  was referred to as mlva genotype cbnl <dig>  and was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> animal samples obtained from  <dig> dairy goat farms, one dairy cattle farm and two sheep farms. roest et al.
 <cit>  used  <dig> mlva markers for genotyping c. burnetii, as described by
 <cit> . five of these markers, ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  and ms <dig>  can be compared to our study, and mlva genotype cbnl <dig> showed identical numbers of tandem repeats within these loci when compared to our most common mlva genotype a
 <cit> .

the mlva loci that can be compared between the three molecular typing studies of c. burnetii during the q fever epidemic in the netherlands show identical results for the numbers of tandem repeats within these loci for the most common genotypes. however, even when the different mlva assays investigate the same markers, differences in primers used for amplification and other laboratory-specific conditions may affect the outcome of the analyses. in addition, the scoring of the numbers of tandem repeats may differ between individual researchers. this was illustrated by the outcome of an interlaboratory comparison with  <dig> european participants
 <cit> . finally, the sequence information regarding the repeat motif for a number of mlva loci was not published
 <cit> . this lead to the development of new primers for marker ms <dig> in our study, which target a slightly different region than published by
 <cit> . therefore, comparisons of c. burnetii mlva typing between laboratories requires a consensus approach, and confirmation of the number of tandem repeats by sequencing will play an essential role in providing the basis for confident calculations. this is of particular importance when the differences between mlva genotypes, both within and between studies, are rather small.

establishing a direct relationship between  human q fever cases and a single  of c. burnetii affected farms remains a challenge. two epidemiological studies performed during the q fever outbreaks in  <dig> and  <dig> in the netherlands showed a strong association between clusters of human q fever cases and a commercial dairy goat farm
 <cit>  and a non-dairy sheep farm
 <cit> . although these studies focused on the best described clusters of human q fever cases observed during the outbreaks, information about the number of c. burnetii genotypes circulating in patients, the environment, and potential veterinary sources in the netherlands was not available at that time. molecular typing of all samples obtained from animals and surface swabs from the dairy goat farm that was identified as the most probable source of a cluster of human q fever cases
 <cit> , revealed the presence of mlva genotype a only. unfortunately, molecular typing of the samples obtained from the non-dairy sheep farm that had been identified as the primary source for the cluster of human q fever cases in its vicinity in 2009
 <cit> , was not successful due to low c. burnetii dna content . investigations of c. burnetii mlva genotypes in patients
 <cit> , dairy live-stock
 <cit>  mentioned earlier, and environmental and animal matrices in this study, showed that a single c. burnetii mlva genotype is dominant in the netherlands. based on these data we conclude that the resolution attained by using mlva is insufficient for pinpointing individual sources in most cases, as it is likely that the dominant c. burnetii type will be detected on several farms and in different patients in a particular area.

another factor that complicates source-finding investigations, is that these studies are often biased by the selection of farms. for instance, in  <dig> about  <dig>  goats were registered on  <dig> farms in the netherlands. about  <dig>  goats were distributed over  <dig> large commercial dairy goat farms.

the number of sheep was even larger in  <dig>  with over one million sheep present in the netherlands, distributed over  <dig>  registered farms . only a small subset of these farms were selected for source-finding investigations in  <dig>  and  <dig> . therefore, the number of mlva genotypes observed in this study is an underestimation, because only  <dig> % of commercial dairy goat farms and less than 1% of sheep farms present in the netherlands in  <dig> were included. since dairy goat farms were quickly identified as the most probable sources for human q fever in the netherlands
 <cit> , the numbers of investigated dairy goat farms were much higher when compared to other potential sources for human q fever . primarily, those farms located in close proximity to human q fever cases were selected. within these clusters, farms were encountered with large numbers of samples positive for c. burnetii, as well as farms without any positive samples
 <cit> . furthermore, it is an interesting observation that rats, a potential reservoir for c. burnetii <cit> , collected on a cattle farm showed a different mlva genotype  in comparison to rats collected on a dairy goat farm . genotype e was also encountered in environmental samples obtained from a dairy goat farm, but only when genotype a was also detected. mlva genotype f was observed on a single dairy sheep farm only and not on dairy goat farms, or non-dairy sheep farms. although these data may suggest a preferential association of particular genotypes with specific hosts, further studies are needed to substantiate such a link. finally, adequate source-finding studies for accurate source-attribution in the dutch situation require a more detailed analysis of the strains present in animals, the environment and humans. such studies would benefit from a method that enables strain differentiation at a higher resolution, both in time and in space. this requires improved genotyping methods specifically designed for the genotypes encountered in the dutch outbreaks.

CONCLUSIONS
mlva genotype a is the most common genotype in animal samples obtained from goat, sheep, and rats, and in environmental samples that are considered to be a major transmission route from animals to humans. the finding of a single most common genotype in patients, environment, and livestock complicates accurate source finding. the resolution attained by using mlva is insufficient for pinpointing individual sources, as it is likely that the dominant c. burnetii type will be detected on several farms and in different patients in a particular area. confident mlva-typing of c. burnetii will be improved by the confirmation of the number of tandem repeats by sequencing for confident calculations of the number of tandem repeats. moreover, it is very important that a consensus, about counting, scoring and identifying the number of tandem repeats for each locus, is reached for strengthening the outcome of mlva analyses.
