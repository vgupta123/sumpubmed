BACKGROUND
the heterogeneity of human breast cancers results from subpopulations of stem/progenitor cells that possess the capacity for multi-lineage differentiation, and the ability to self-renew and initiate the formation of tumors . it has been proposed that the acquired phenotypes of cancer stem cell populations, which constitute approximately 1% to 5% of the cells in primary breast tumors  <cit> , can direct the development of therapy-resistant tumors and relapse of the disease, which significantly influences the effectiveness of a therapeutic strategy  <cit> . therefore, a critical issue in cancer treatment is the identification of anti-cancer agents that can directly target cancer stem cells to prevent their self-renewal and/or tumor plasticity. however, an experimental constraint that has limited the characterization of stem cell targeted molecules is the low number of cells that can be isolated from stem cell populations enriched in vitro in tumorspheres  <cit> , or enriched in side-populations of tumor-initiating cells isolated by flow cytometry from primary tumors  <cit> . furthermore, once cultured in vitro, the in vivo isolated stem cell populations can lose their stem cell character and/or viability.

the orphan epidermal growth factor  receptor gene family member her <dig>  is associated with an enhancement of stem/progenitor cell population levels in populations of either normal mammary epithelial cells or certain cancer cell lines  <cit> . signaling by her <dig> is highly associated with aggressive metastatic forms of breast cancer  <cit> , and the gene is amplified in 20% to 30% of all human breast cancers  <cit> . expression of exogenous her <dig> in normal mammary stem cell populations generated hyperplastic lesions when transplanted in vivo  <cit> , and in breast cancer cells her <dig> expression enhanced the occurrence of side-populations of tumor-initiating cells of the luminal subtype and is clinically correlated with cancer stem cell populations  <cit> . by expressing exogenous her <dig> in the mcf-10at cell line, a well-established model of human mammary epithelial preneoplasia  <cit> , we generated a new breast cancer cell line, denoted as 10at-her <dig>  which is highly enriched with cells that display several cancer stem/progenitor cell-like properties. mcf-10at cells were originally chosen as the starting cell population for our study because of the intrinsic low incidence of tumor formation  and the lack of any cancer stem cell-like characteristics. in xenografts of immunocompromised mice, a majority of mcf-10at cells will manifest into normal-appearing ducts; however, a small percentage will displays lesions ranging from atypical hyperplasia to invasive carcinoma . it is these qualities that made the parent mcf-10at cells an ideal candidate system for studying the development of breast cancer via cancer stem/progenitor cells. cell populations enriched with breast cancer stem cells can be identified by expression of specific sets of marker proteins such as nucleostemin and aldehyde dehydrogenase- <dig> , which are associated with maintenance and self-renewal properties , and by their cd44+/cd24-/low phenotype  <cit> . we observed that the 10at-her <dig> cell population, but not the corresponding 10at-neo transfection control cells, express high levels of nucleostemin and active aldh- <dig> in the context of a cd44+/cd24-/low phenotype, and are able to form tumors xenografts efficiently in vivo in athymic mice and form tumorspheres in suspension cultures at limiting cell dilutions. the 10at-her <dig> cell system provided the experimental opportunity directly to test the hypothesis that cellular components that help define the cancer stem/progenitor character, such as nucleostemin, can confer selective responsiveness of anti-cancer compounds to target breast cancer stem/progenitor populations.

indole-3-carbinol , a natural indole carbinol produced from the hydrolysis of glucobrassicinin, is found in cruciferous vegetables of the brassica genus, such as broccoli and cabbage, and is a promising anti-cancer compound . i3c treatment activates distinct sets of anti-proliferative signaling cascades in a wide range of human breast cancer cells , inhibits the in vivo growth of human breast cancer cell-derived tumor xenografts  <cit> , and reduces tumor metastasis and breast cancer cell migration  <cit> . clinical trials have concluded that ingested i3c possesses anti-cancer effects in human populations, has beneficial effects on estrogen metabolism  <cit> , and, based on cytotoxicity studies, patients can receive as high as 800 mg/kg/day of i3c without any adverse side effects . it is important to note that the functional intracellular concentration of i3c is significantly lower than the treated amount in in vitro and in vivo studies because in cell culture studies only approximately  <dig> % of extracellular i3c enters a cell  <cit> .

a key advance in understanding the molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer actions of indole carbinols is our discovery that i3c and its highly potent derivative 1-benzyl-i3c  <cit> , but not the natural i3c dimerization product  <dig> '-dimethylindolylmethane , act as direct noncompetitive inhibitors of elastase enzymatic activity, the first such identified target protein for i3c  <cit> . intriguingly, a high level of elastase activity has been associated with late stage breast cancer  <cit> . in silico simulations that model i3c interactions with the crystallographic structure of elastase, uncovered a critical interaction site for i3c  that provided the experimental foundation for generating a truncated form of elastase that is enzymatically active but resistant to inhibition by either i3c or 1-benzyl-i3c  <cit> . using this unique reagent, we demonstrate that i3c triggers an elastase-dependent anti-proliferative response in the 10at-her <dig> breast cancer cell population by promoting nucleostemin to interact with and sequester the murine double mutant  <dig>  protein into the nucleolus, thereby allowing the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein to escape from the mdm <dig> inhibition of apoptotic activity. our study has uncovered new mechanistic insights into how the cancer stem/progenitor cell-associated component nucleostemin is directly involved in an anti-proliferative cell signaling pathway triggered by i3c, a natural anti-cancer molecule.

RESULTS
expression of exogenous her <dig> in preneoplastic mammary epithelial cells induces a stable cancer stem/progenitor cell-like phenotype
to generate a mammary epithelial cancer cell system highly enriched with tumor-initiating cells that express high levels of nucleostemin, preneoplastic mcf-10at human mammary epithelial cells  were stably transfected with either the cmv-her <dig> expression vector containing the neomycin resistance gene, or the control cmv-neomycin resistance gene vector forming 10at-her <dig> and 10at-neo cells, respectively. western blot analysis demonstrated that 10at-her <dig> cells expressed significantly higher levels of her <dig> compared to the control 10at-neo cell line . i3c-treated conditions will be discussed in a later section. western blots also demonstrated that the 10at-her <dig> cell population is highly enriched with cells that express significantly elevated levels of nucleostemin, aldh- <dig> and cd <dig>  and the maintenance of nearly undetectable levels of cd <dig> , which is a phenotype associated with a cancer stem cell/progenitor cell-like character. in contrast, the control 10at-neo cell population maintained the same phenotype as the starting preneoplastic mcf-10at cells with nearly undetectable to low levels of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  aldh- <dig> and nucleostemin.figure  <dig>

to determine the percentage of cells within the 10at-her <dig> cell population that display stem/progenitor cell-like marker proteins, the levels of cell surface-associated cd <dig> and cd <dig> were quantified by flow cytometry using antibodies specific for either cd <dig> or cd <dig>  as shown in figure 1b, greater than 98% of 10at-her <dig> cells in the population express high levels of cd <dig> compared to the background levels observed with control transfected 10at-neo cells. the level of cd <dig> remained low in both cell lines and was expressed in less than 2% of the cell population . an aldefluor assay verified that greater than 88% of the aldh- <dig> in the 10at-her <dig> cell population is enzymatically active while less than 1% of the aldh- <dig> in 10at-neo cells was active . the elevated level of aldh- <dig> activity in the 10at-her <dig> cell population is consistent with previous studies showing that the subpopulations within normal and cancer human mammary epithelial cells with increased aldh- <dig> have stem/progenitor cell-like properties  <cit> . the phenotype of the overall 10at-her <dig> cell population, which displays high levels of nucleostemin and active aldh- <dig> in a cd44+/cd24–/low phenotype background, has remained stable after continuous culturing of this cell line for more than 6 months over many cell generations.

the in vitro formation of tumorspheres in cell suspension cultures is considered a cellular property of cancer stem/progenitor cells within a cell population that is predictive of tumor initiation properties  <cit> . 10at-her <dig> and 10at-neo cells were therefore cultured at low density  in cell suspensions, and in vitro tumorsphere formation was monitored visually for 6 days. as shown in figure 2a, 10at-her <dig> cells began to form tumorsphere-like structures within 2 days of culture and by 6 days the cells formed completed tumorspheres. in contrast, the control 10at-neo cells failed to form tumorspheres and remained dispersed in small cell aggregates. the tumorsphere-forming efficiency of 10at-her <dig> cells was compared to that of two luminal subtype tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines, skbr <dig> and mcf- <dig>  which differ in their expression of her <dig>  <cit> . the western blot insert in figure 2b shows that skbr <dig> and 10at-her <dig> cells produce approximately the same levels of her <dig> protein, whereas mcf- <dig> cells produce significantly lower levels of her <dig>  by culturing increasing numbers of cells in suspension, the 10at-her <dig> cells were more than tenfold more efficient in their tumorsphere-forming capability compared to either skbr <dig> or mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells . for example, the number of tumorspheres formed from  <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells was observed only when  <dig>  skbr <dig> cells or  <dig>  mcf- <dig> cells were assayed. also, because skbr <dig> and 10at-her <dig> express similar levels of her <dig> protein, the ability of 10at-her <dig> cells to form tumorspheres cannot be attributed only to the high level of exogenous her <dig> figure  <dig> 
tumorsphere formation efficiency in cell suspension cultures, expression of stem/progenitor cell marker proteins and proliferation of breast cancer cells.  10at-her <dig> and 10at-neo cells were plated at a density of  <dig>  cells per well in serum-free non-adherent suspension cultures as described in the methods section. at the indicated days in culture, tumorsphere formation was assessed visually by phase microscopy. scale bar represents 50 μm.  10at-her <dig> and 10at-neo cells as well as the skbr <dig> and mcf- <dig> human breast cancer cell lines were incubated at the indicated cell densities. tumorsphere formation efficiency was quantified after 6 days in culture under non-adherent conditions. the presented values are an average of three independent experiments. the gel inserts are western blots showing relative levels of her <dig> protein expression and actin controls from electrophoretically fractionated total cell extracts of mcf- <dig>  skbr <dig> and 10at-her <dig> cells.  cultured 10at-neo, 10at-her <dig>  mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and skbr <dig> cells were harvested, total cell extracts electrophoretically fractionated and the levels of expressed her <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  aldh- <dig>  nucleostemin  and actin protein determined by western blots.  to examine the effects of i3c on cell proliferation, 10at-neo, 10at-her <dig>  skbr <dig>  mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells cultured in a 24-well plate were treated with 200 μm i3c for the indicated times and the cell number quantified as described in the methods section. aldh- <dig>  aldehyde dehydrogenase-1; her <dig>  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2; ns, nucleostemin.



to compare the expression of cancer stem/progenitor cell-like marker protein in the 10at-her <dig> cell population with other well-established human breast cancer cell lines, protein levels of nucleostemin, cd <dig>  aldh- <dig> and cd <dig> were assessed in 10at-neo, 10at-her <dig>  mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and skbr <dig> cells . as mentioned above, mcf- <dig> and skbr <dig> cells represent two distinct luminal subtypes, whereas, mda-mb- <dig> cells represent a triple negative basal subtype. western blot analysis indicated that 10at-her <dig> cells and skbr <dig> cells express relatively comparable levels of her <dig>  cd <dig>  nucleostemin and aldh- <dig> protein, although the tumorsphere-forming properties of skbr <dig> cells are significantly less efficient than that of 10at-her <dig> cells . densitometric analysis of the western blots show that both mcf- <dig> cells and mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells express approximately 30% of the levels of nucleostemin compared to either 10at-her <dig> or skbr <dig> cells. the production of aldh- <dig> was not detected in either mcf- <dig> cells or mda-mb- <dig> cells, whereas, mcf- <dig> cells also do not express cd <dig>  these results show that even though well-established breast cancer cell lines express specific stem/progenitor cell-like protein markers, the 10at-her <dig> cell population can be considered to have a more enhanced ‘stemness’ character because of its highly efficient tumorsphere-formation property , and as discussed in later sections, its ability to form tumor xenografts at low cell numbers in athymic mice.

the anti-proliferative effects of i3c were analyzed in 10at-her <dig> cells and 10at-neo cells in comparison to mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and skbr <dig> breast cancer cells, which we have previously shown to be sensitive to this natural indole carbinol compound . cells were treated with 200 μm i3c, which is the optimal concentration for its anti-cancer effects in breast cancer cell lines , and the number of cells in each cell culture well were quantified throughout 48 hours. as shown in figure 2d, of the tested cell lines, 10at-her <dig> cells were the most sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of i3c and displayed a near complete loss of cell proliferation after 48 hours of treatment with i3c. in contrast, the transfection control 10at-neo cells were only mildly sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of i3c. each of the three well-established breast cancer cell lines show similar levels of sensitivity to i3c, although the effect was not as efficient as observed in the 10at-her <dig> cells.

i3c disrupts in vitro 10at-her <dig> cell tumorsphere formation and in vivo tumor xenograft growth
the potential i3c inhibition of the in vitro formation of 10at-her <dig> cell tumorspheres was examined in cell suspensions that were treated for 6 days with or without 200 μm i3c. analysis by light microscopy revealed that i3c completely prevented the in vitro formation of tumorspheres . only approximately  <dig> % of i3c enters breast cancer cells from the cell culture medium  <cit> , so the functional intracellular concentration of this indole carbinol compound is significantly lower than that added to the cell cultures. quantification of the efficiency of 10at-her <dig> cell tumorsphere formation demonstrated that i3c had strong inhibitory effects on this cancer stem/progenitor cell-like process . this inhibitory effect on in vitro 10at-her <dig> cell tumorsphere formation was specific for i3c-based indole carbinol compounds because the highly potent i3c derivative 1-benzyl-i3c  <cit>  inhibited tumorsphere formation by 98% at significantly lower concentrations than i3c; whereas, the inactive indole carbinol compound tryptophol, which is structurally similar to i3c  <cit> , had no effect on tumorsphere formation . other phytochemicals that display strong anti-proliferative responses in a variety of breast cancer cell lines, such as the natural i3c dimer, dim  <cit> , and artemisinin  <cit> , had no effect on 10at-her <dig> cell tumorsphere formation . therefore, the disruption of tumorsphere formation in cell suspension cultures is a property specific to i3c and its highly potent derivative compared to other phytochemicals that can target breast cancer cells.figure  <dig>

growth inhibition by i3c.  10at-her <dig> cells were plated at a density of  <dig>  cells per well in tumorsphere culture conditions and incubated with or without 200 μm i3c. after 6 days in cell suspension cultures, tumorsphere formation was assessed visually by phase microscopy and quantified. scale bar represents 50 μm.  10at-her <dig> cells were plated at a density of either  <dig>  cells per well or  <dig>  cells per well in tumorsphere culture conditions and then incubated with 10 μm 1-benzyl-i3c , 200 μm i3c, 50 μm dim, 200 μm tryptophol , 300 μm artemisinin  or with the dmso vehicle control . after 6 days in cell suspension cultures, tumorsphere formation was assessed visually by phase microscopy and quantified.  three million 10at-neo cells  or  <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells  were implanted in athymic mice, and  <dig> separate tumor injection sites were examined for palpable tumors after 5 weeks and quantified.  after the formation of detectable 10at-her <dig> cell-derived palpable tumor xenografts, athymic mice were treated subcutaneously with either 300 mg/kg of i3c or the dmso vehicle control. tumor volumes were quantified with a caliper from ten tumor xenografts per condition using two tumor sites per animal. the micrograph insert shows representative tumors excised from 2-week-post injection animals. 1bi, 1-benzyl-i3c; art, artemisinin; dim,  <dig> '-dimethylindolylmethane; her <dig>  10at-her2; i3c, indole-3-carbinol; neo, 10at-neo; trp, tryptophol; vc, vehicle control.



the in vivo tumor-initiating capability of the 10at-her <dig> cell line in comparison to control 10at-neo cells was analyzed by formation of tumor xenografts in nih iii athymic nude mice. when  <dig> million control 10at-neo cells were injected into the athymic mice, this cell line displayed a 20% to 25% tumor efficiency, which is consistent with sporadic events associated with the preneoplastic nature of the parental mcf-10at cell line . in contrast, 10at-her <dig> cells were highly efficient in the ability to form tumor xenografts in athymic mice. in a series of limiting dilution studies, injection of  <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells form tumor xenografts at nearly 100% efficiency  and are capable of tumor initiation when injections are carried out with as few as  <dig>  cells . the ability of 10at-her <dig> cells to form tumor xenografts in vivo is tenfold more efficient than that reported for highly tumorigenic human breast cancer cell lines such as mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and skbr <dig>  which require approximately  <dig> million cells for tumor xenografts to be observed  <cit> .

to assess the in vivo effects of i3c on the growth of 10at-her2-cell-derived tumor xenografts,  <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells were injected into nih iii athymic mice and the resulting tumors were first allowed to grow to an average volume of approximately 100 mm <dig>  the mice were then injected subcutaneously with either i3c  or with the dimethyl sulfoxide  vehicle control over 19 days. in vehicle-control-treated animals, the 10at-her <dig> cell tumor xenografts showed robust growth . the concentration of i3c used for the mice injections is approximately equivalent to the 200 μm i3c used to treat the cultured cell lines. also, in phase  <dig> clinical trials, women have been given as high a dose as 800 mg i3c per day with high tolerability , suggesting that relatively high doses of i3c can be tolerated without any adverse side effects. in the absence of i3c, the resulting tumor xenografts displayed highly concentrated gross tumor vascularization and were dense , consistent with the rapid growth of cells within the tumor. i3c strongly suppressed the growth of 10at-her <dig> cell-derived tumor xenografts , and the resulting tumors appeared less vascularized and much smaller in size . the texture of the residual tumors from i3c-treated mice was pliable, consistent with reduced cell density in the xenografts. coupled with the fact that 10at-her <dig> cells are ten times more efficient at forming tumorspheres in vitro , our in vivo results strongly suggest that the 10at-her <dig> cell population is highly enriched with cancer stem/progenitor-like cells with an efficient tumor-initiation capability.

i3c induces a p53-dependent apoptotic response and promotes the interaction of the stem cell marker protein nucleostemin with the mdm <dig> in 10at-her <dig> cells
to assess the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of i3c, 10at-her <dig> cells and 10at-neo cells were initially cultured in adherent monolayers and treated with or without 200 μm i3c over 72 hours. the total cell number was determined using the cell-counting kit- <dig> assay  <cit> . i3c rapidly prevented the proliferation of 10at-her <dig> cells with a maximal response observed by 72 hours , whereas, proliferation of the control 10at-neo cells remained relatively unaffected by i3c treatment . flow cytometry of nuclear dna stained with propidium iodide revealed that 48 hours of i3c treatment induced a significant increase in 10at-her <dig> cells with a sub-g <dig> dna content compared to vehicle-control-treated cells, which is indicative of the activation of apoptosis . the control 10at-neo cells remained relatively resistant to i3c and displayed only a very minor increase in cells with a sub g1-dna content . under these conditions, i3c treatment of 10at-her <dig> cells did not alter the expression of the cancer stem/progenitor cell-like marker proteins nucleostemin, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and aldh- <dig> .figure  <dig> 
i3c induces p53-dependent apoptosis and regulation of mdm2–p <dig> and mdm2–nucleostemin protein–protein interactions.  10at-her <dig> and 10at-neo cells were treated with or without 200 μm i3c for the indicated durations and cell number was quantified by the cell proliferation assay described in the methods section.  10at-neo and 10at-her <dig> cells were treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours. the dna content of nuclear dna stained with propidium iodide was assessed by flow cytometry.  10at-her <dig> cells were treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours, total cell extracts were electrophoretically fractionated and then western blots probed for parp, akt <dig>  p <dig> and the actin gel loading control.  10at-her <dig> cells were transfected with either a dominant negative p <dig>  expression vector or with the empty expression vector , and then treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours. the dna content of nuclear dna stained with propidium iodide was assessed by flow cytometry.  10at-her <dig> cells were treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours. total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either mdm <dig>  or nucleostemin  antibodies. as a control, non-immune antibodies  and samples not immunoprecipitated  were used. all extracts were electrophoretically fractionated and probed by western blot analysis using antibodies specific to p <dig>  serine- <dig> phosphorylated mdm <dig> or total mdm <dig>  or with antibodies specific to either serine- <dig> phosphorylated mdm <dig> or total mdm <dig> . dn, dominant negative; ev, empty expression vector; i3c, indole-3-carbinol; igg, immunoglobulin g; ip, immunoprecipitated; mdm <dig>  murine double mutant 2; parp, poly adp ribose polymerase.



to determine whether i3c induced an apoptotic response and verify the sub-g <dig> dna content observed by flow cytometry, 10at-her <dig> cells were treated with or without i3c. western blots probed for the production of cleaved poly adp ribose polymerase  protein, a substrate of activated caspase  <dig> in the apoptotic pathway  <cit> . as shown in figure 4c, i3c treatment strongly stimulated parp cleavage as shown by the detection of significant levels of the 85-kda parp cleavage product, and 10at-her <dig> cells express similar levels of the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein in the presence or absence of i3c. it is well established that regulation of the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein plays an important role in the control of cellular apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, the potential role of p <dig> in the i3c apoptotic response was functionally evaluated by transfection of 10at-her <dig> cells with either a dominant negative  p <dig> or an empty expression vector  as a control. flow cytometry of nuclear dna stained with propidium iodide from 48-hour i3c-treated or untreated cells revealed that expression of dn p <dig> prevented the i3c-stimulated production of sub-g <dig> dna content, which is indicative of loss of apoptosis, whereas i3c efficiently induced an apoptotic response in 10at-her <dig> cells transfected with the empty vector .

one known mechanism by which the p53-dependent apoptotic response can be regulated is through the direct binding of mdm <dig> to p <dig>  which prevents the apoptotic activity of p <dig> by sequestering p <dig> away from its apoptotic targets  <cit> . mdm <dig> co-immunoprecipitations were carried out to determine whether i3c treatment disrupts the ability of mdm <dig> to interact with p <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells were treated with or without i3c for 48 hours and the immunoabsorbed mdm <dig> protein complex was electrophoretically fractionated and western blots probed for the presence of p <dig> in the immunoabsorbed protein. in the absence of i3c, a significant amount of p <dig> protein co-immunoprecipitated with mdm <dig>  which shows the presence of the mdm2–p <dig> protein interaction in proliferating cells, whereas, in contrast, after i3c treatment, the mdm2–p <dig> protein interaction is nearly ablated . this result suggests that the i3c disruption of mdm <dig> binding to p <dig> frees this tumor suppressor protein to trigger its apoptotic response. consistent with this concept, expression of a constitutively active form of akt- <dig>  which phosphorylates mdm <dig> and promotes mdm <dig> binding to p <dig>  <cit> , prevented the i3c apoptotic response and restored mdm2–p <dig> protein interactions .

because i3c triggers anti-proliferative signaling in 10at-her <dig> cells through a p53- dependent response, we examined whether cellular components that define the cancer stem/progenitor cell-like phenotype may be associated with the i3c regulation of the mdm2–p <dig> pathway. one such intriguing molecular marker that is highly expressed in self-renewing cancer stem/progenitor cells and is associated with the mdm2–p <dig> pathway is nucleostemin , which is a nuclear gtpase that has been shown to interact directly with mdm <dig>  <cit> . there is only limited information concerning the regulation or functional significance of nucleostemin–mdm <dig> protein interactions in human cancer cells  <cit> . i3c had no effect on the total levels of nucleostemin protein  or total mdm <dig>  expressed in 10at-her <dig> cells, although the level of detectable serine- <dig>  phosphorylated mdm <dig> decreased in i3c-treated cells . co-immunoprecipitations were carried out by immunoadsorbing nucleostemin from 48-hour i3c-treated or untreated cells and then western blots probed for either the ser <dig> phosphorylated mdm <dig> or total mdm <dig> protein. as shown in figure 4f, i3c treatment strongly enhanced nucleostemin interactions with both the ser <dig> phosphorylated mdm <dig> protein and the total mdm <dig> protein. this result suggests that the i3c-induced interaction of nucleostemin with the ser <dig> phosphorylated form of mdm <dig> prevents p <dig> from binding to mdm <dig> and accounts for the ability of this natural indole carbinol compound to trigger a p53-dependent apoptotic response in 10at-her <dig> cells.

to assess whether the i3c regulation of mdm <dig> protein interactions with p <dig> and/or nucleostemin occurs in other indole-carbinol-sensitive breast cancer cells, three well-established cell lines, skbr <dig>  mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig>  were treated with or without i3c for 48 hours and mdm2–p <dig> and nucleostemin–mdm <dig> co-immunoprecipitations carried out as described above for 10at-her <dig> cells. as shown in figure 5a, i3c disrupted mdm2–p <dig> interactions and stimulated nucleostemin–mdm <dig> interactions in skbr <dig> cells, a cell line that expresses nucleostemin and other stem/progenitor cell-like marker proteins approximately to the same levels as the 10at-her <dig> cell population . therefore, the effects of i3c on nucleostemin–mdm <dig> and mdm2–p <dig> interactions that we observed with 10at-her <dig> cells is not limited only to this newly developed breast cancer cell line. in contrast, even though mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells are sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of i3c, there were no detectable changes in mdm2–p <dig> or nucleostemin–p <dig> protein interactions after i3c treatment . based on expression of marker proteins, the relative stemness character of the mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cell populations can be considered less than that of either skbr <dig> or 10at-her <dig> cells, which may be associated with the lack of any effects of i3c treatment on nucleostemin protein–protein interactions.figure  <dig>

interfering rna knockdown of nucleostemin in 10at-her <dig> cells disrupts the i3c-stimulated localization of mdm <dig> into the nucleolus compartment, strongly attenuates the i3c-induced apoptotic response and partially reverses the loss of mdm2–p <dig> interactions
given that nucleostemin resides in the nucleolus  <cit>  and mdm <dig> translocates between the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> , an intriguing issue is whether the i3c-induced nucleostemin- mdm <dig> interaction drives the localization of mdm <dig> to the nucleus in i3c-treated cells. this possibility was functionally examined by sirna knockdown of nucleostemin. western blots showed that nucleostemin sirna efficiently reduced the levels of nucleostemin compared to cells receiving scrambled sirna . the localization of mdm <dig> was initially examined in cells treated for 48 hours with or without i3c and then biochemically fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. western blots showed that in cells transfected with scrambled sirna, i3c treatment causes the redistribution of mdm <dig> from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions into predominantly the nuclear fraction . in contrast, knockdown of nucleostemin prevented the i3c-induced subcellular localization of mdm <dig> into the nuclear fraction. under each condition, the cytoplasmic fraction remained enriched in the cytoplasmic marker hsp <dig>  whereas the nuclear compartment was enriched in nuclear marker lamin.figure  <dig>

in 10at-her <dig> cells transfected with scrambled sirna, indirect immunofluorescence revealed that nucleostemin is localized to punctate foci in the nucleus in the presence or absence of i3c, which is indicative of the nucleolus compartment . strikingly, i3c treatment triggered the redistribution of mdm <dig> from both the nucleus and cytoplasm, to an enriched punctate staining pattern as foci in the nucleus . merging of the nucleostemin and mdm <dig> immunofluorescence staining in the scrambled sirna transfected cells treated with i3c revealed that nucleostemin and mdm <dig> co-localize into identical foci staining patterns . importantly, sirna knockdown of nucleostemin completely disrupted the nuclear foci staining of mdm <dig> in i3c-treated cells, and the overall localization of mdm <dig> resembled that observed in cells not treated with i3c .

to determine whether the i3c apoptotic response in 10at-her <dig> cells requires expression of nucleostemin, cells transfected with either nucleostemin or scrambled sirna were treated with or without i3c for 48 hours. the relative apoptotic response was quantified as the ratio of sub-g <dig> content dna in untreated to i3c-treated cells. as shown in figure 7a, sirna knockdown of nucleostemin significantly attenuated the apoptotic response compared to that observed in 10at-her <dig> cells transfected with scrambled sirna. co-immunoprecipitations of i3c-treated and untreated cells demonstrated that knockdown of nucleostemin partially reversed the i3c disruption of mdm2–p <dig> protein interactions . the level of mdm2–p <dig> interactions in i3c-treated cells transfected with nucleostemin sirna was approximately the same as vehicle-control-treated scramble sirna transfected cells . interestingly, sirna knockdown of nucleostemin increased the overall levels of p <dig>  also, i3c treatment efficiently inhibited production of ser <dig> phosphorylated mdm <dig> regardless of the presence of nucleostemin , suggesting that this regulated step is upstream of the i3c-regulated process that affects nucleostemin. taken together, these results demonstrate that i3c requires the nucleostemin cancer stem cell marker to trigger its apoptotic anti-proliferative pathway in the 10at-her <dig> cell population.figure  <dig>

expression of an i3c-resistant form of elastase in 10at-her <dig> cells disrupts the indole carbinol apoptotic response, and reverses the i3c effects on mdm2–p <dig>  nucleostemin–mdm <dig> and cd40–traf <dig> protein–protein interactions
we previously established that elastase is the biologically relevant indole carbinol target protein in human breast cancer cells, and the non-competitive inhibition of elastase enzymatic activity by i3c triggers a shift from cell survival signaling to apoptotic signaling that is mediated by altered signaling through downstream elastase substrates such as the cd <dig> member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family  <cit> . the indole carbinol inhibition of elastase activity prevents the processing and cleavage of cd <dig> that results in the stable production of the full-length 44-kda form of cd <dig>  <cit> . because elastase is the only established direct target protein for i3c, we assessed whether elastase is required for the i3c anti-proliferative signaling in the 10at-her <dig> cell population. to test this possibility, 10at-her <dig> cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the wild-type  elastase or the Δ <dig> i3c-resistant form of elastase, which has a carboxyterminal truncation and remains highly enzymatically active but resistant to the inhibitory effects of i3c  <cit> . another set of 10at-her <dig> cells was transfected with the ev. transfected 10at-her <dig> cells were treated with or without i3c for 48 hours. western blots of total cell extracts demonstrated that in cells transfected with the wt elastase or the ev, the level of the uncleaved 44-kda form of cd <dig> is significantly enhanced after i3c treatment , which is indicative of an inhibition of elastase activity  <cit> . in 10at-her <dig> cells expressing the i3c-resistant elastase , the level of uncleaved cd <dig> remained low in both indole-carbinol-treated and untreated cells , which confirms that this truncated elastase remains active under both conditions.figure  <dig>

tumor xenografts.  10at-her <dig> cells were transfected with either the ev, wt elastase expression vector or the ∆ <dig> truncated elastase expression vector and treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours. cell extracts were electrophoretically fractionated and probed by western blot analysis for cd <dig>  akt <dig> and hsp <dig>   10at-her <dig> cells were transfected with ev, wt or ∆ <dig> expression vectors and treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours. the relative amount of apoptosis was quantified by the ratio of sub-g <dig> dna contents as determined by flow cytometry of nuclear dna stained with propidium iodide. the number of apoptotic cells observed after i3c treatment were normalized to dmso-vehicle-control-treated cells.  10at-her <dig> cells were transfected with ev, wt or ∆ <dig> expression vectors and treated with or without 200 μm i3c for 48 hours. total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either cd <dig>  nucleostemin  or mdm <dig>  antibodies. as controls, immunoprecipitations were carried out with non-immune antibodies  or not immunoprecipitated . cell extracts were electrophoretically fractionated and probed by western blot analysis using antibodies specific to tumor necrosis factor receptor activator factor- <dig>  , mdm <dig>  or p <dig> .  10at-her <dig> cells were stably transfected with ev, wt or ∆ <dig> expression vectors and  <dig>  cells were used for xenograft injections of athymic mice. after the formation of detectable palpable tumor xenografts, athymic mice were treated subcutaneously with either 300 mg/kg of i3c or the dmso vehicle control. tumor volumes were quantified with a caliper from ten tumor xenografts per condition using two tumor sites per animal. the micrograph insert shows representative tumors excised from 2-week-post-injection animals. dmso, dimethyl sulfoxide; ev, empty expression vector; i3c, indole-3-carbinol; igg, immunoglobulin g; ip, immunoprecipitated; mdm <dig>  murine double mutant 2; traf <dig>  tumor necrosis factor receptor activator factor-6; wt, wild type.



co-immunoprecipitations revealed that in 10at-her <dig> cells transfected with either the wt elastase or the ev, i3c treatment disrupted the binding of cd <dig> with one of its immediate downstream effectors, tumor necrosis factor receptor activator factor- <dig> , which is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that can ubiquitinate akt- <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, in cells expressing the Δ <dig> i3c-resistant elastase, traf <dig> remained associated with cd <dig> in the presence or absence of i3c treatment . the total levels of traf <dig> remained unaffected by i3c treatment . consistent with the i3c-regulated release of traf <dig> from cd <dig> in cells expressing endogenous  or exogenous  elastase, the protein levels of akt- <dig> decreased in i3c-treated cells, whereas, in cells expressing the i3c-resistant elastase , the levels of akt- <dig> protein remained unaltered after i3c treatment .

to determine the dependence of elastase in the i3c apoptotic response, 10at-her <dig> cells transfected with the wt elastase gene, the i3c-resistant form of elastase or the ev were treated with or without i3c for 48 hours. nuclear dna stained with propidium iodide was analyzed by flow cytometry. the apoptotic response was quantified by the ratio of sub-g <dig> dna content in i3c-treated to untreated cells. as shown in figure 8b, 10at-her <dig> cells expressing the i3c-resistant elastase were mostly resistant to the indole-carbinol-induced apoptosis, whereas cells expressing either endogenous  or exogenous  elastase remained highly sensitive to the anti-proliferative effect of i3c. this result establishes a role for the i3c target protein elastase in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of this natural indole carbinol compound. co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that compared to 10at-her <dig> cells expressing endogenous or exogenous wt elastase, expression of the Δ <dig> i3c-resistant elastase reversed the i3c stimulation of nucleostemin–mdm <dig> interactions  and prevented i3c from disrupting mdm2–p <dig> interactions . these results directly establish a functional connection between the i3c-dependent regulation of signaling through the i3c target protein elastase and the control of protein–protein interactions directed by the cancer stem/progenitor cell marker protein nucleostemin.

in vivo requirement for elastase in the i3c inhibition of 10at-her <dig> cell-derived tumor xenograft growth
the functional role of elastase in mediating the in vivo effects of i3c on tumor xenograft growth was determined by implanting nih iii athymic mice with  <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells stably transfected with either the wt or i3c-resistant ∆ <dig> forms of elastase as well as cells transfected with the ev. tumors were allowed to reach an average volume of 200 mm <dig> before they began to receive subcutaneous injections of i3c or the dmso vehicle control. tumor volumes were monitored throughout 21 days. growth of the tumor xenografts formed with 10at-her <dig> cells transfected with the wt elastase was strongly inhibited in animals injected with i3c compared to animals injected with the vehicle control . cells expressing the ev were similarly sensitive to i3c . in contrast, the tumor xenografts formed from 10at-her <dig> cells stably transfected with the i3c-resistant ∆ <dig> elastase, were completely resistant to i3c and the tumor volumes in i3c-treated and vehicle-control-treated animals were virtually identical . the micrographs in figure  <dig> show representative tumor xenografts after 21 days of growth in i3c-treated and vehicle-control-treated animals. in the cells expressing the endogenous or exogenous wt elastase, the tumor xenografts from i3c-treated animals were smaller in size and they appeared less vascularized and displayed pliable texture suggestive of reduced density compared to tumor xenografts from vehicle-control-treated animals. in contrast, the tumor xenografts formed from 10at-her <dig> cells expressing the i3c-resistant ∆ <dig> elastase displayed similar sizes and characteristics in the presence or absence of i3c treatment. therefore, the i3c regulation of the in vivo growth of the 10at-her <dig> cell population highly enriched in cells with cancer stem/progenitor cell-like properties requires expression of the indole-carbinol-sensitive elastase.

discussion
cancer stem/progenitor cell populations have been isolated in clinical samples of breast cancer tissue that characteristically show a cd44+/cd24–/lin− phenotype  and also preferentially express other stem cell markers such as nucleostemin and active aldh- <dig>  <cit> . the ability to evaluate the efficiency of anti-cancer agents in targeting breast cancer stem cells has been limited by the low number of stem cells that can be isolated from tumors and by the loss of viability and/or instability of the stem cell phenotype once the cells are cultured outside the in vivo context . by expressing her <dig> in human preneoplastic mammary epithelial cells, forming the 10at-her <dig> cell line, we generated a new human breast cancer cell system in which the overall cell population is highly enriched with cells that stably display breast cancer stem/progenitor cell-like properties. the 10at-her <dig> cell population, but not the ev-transfected 10at-neo preneoplastic cells, are cd44+/cd24–/low/aldh-1+ with high levels of nucleostemin. analysis of cell surface expression of the cd <dig> cancer stem/progenitor marker protein by flow cytometry showed that approximately 98% of cells in the 10at-her <dig> cell population express high levels of cell surface cd <dig>  while almost 90% of the cell population contains active aldh- <dig>  consistent with the existence of an enriched population of cells with tumor-initiating properties, 10at-her <dig> cells efficiently form tumorspheres in suspension cell cultures and in vivo form tumor xenografts with significantly lower numbers of implanted cells compared to well-established highly tumorigenic human breast cancer cell lines.

based on the expression pattern of nucleostemin, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and aldh- <dig>  the stemness character of the skbr <dig> human breast cancer population is similar to that of the 10at-her <dig> cell population, whereas mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells express significantly lower levels of nucleostemin and do not produce detectable levels of aldh- <dig>  these protein expression patterns suggest that the 10at-her <dig> breast cancer cell line does not display abhorrent properties with regard to the production of stem/progenitor cell marker proteins. several cellular properties of 10at-her <dig> cells suggest that the cell population is more enriched in stem/progenitor cell-like cells compared to the three tested human breast cancer cell lines. for the highly tumorigenic mcf- <dig> and skbr <dig> cells, typically several million cells are required to be implanted into athymic mice in order to detect a high percentage of tumor xenografts. importantly, in contrast, a near 100% tumor xenograft formation efficiency occurs when only  <dig>  10at-her <dig> cells are implanted into athymic mice, and a significant percentage of tumors per inject site can be detected even when as few as  <dig>  cells are implanted. also, the in vitro tumorsphere-forming efficiency of the 10at-her <dig> cells is at least 100-fold greater than skbr <dig> cells, even though both cell lines express comparable levels of stem/progenitor cell-like marker proteins.

the rationale for expressing exogenous her <dig> into preneoplastic mammary epithelial cells to form the 10at-her <dig> cell line is the functional connection between elevated her <dig> levels and enhanced cancer stem/progenitor cell populations that can be detected in primary breast tumors and cancer cell lines  <cit> . expression of exogenous her <dig> in breast cancer cells enhanced the occurrence of side-populations of tumor-initiating cells of the luminal subtype profile  <cit> . also, her <dig> can be clinically correlated with stem/progenitor cell populations in that patients with her2+ breast cancers treated with the her <dig> inhibitor lapatinib show a significant reduction in the number of cd44+/cd24–/low cells and a decreased tumorsphere-forming efficiency  <cit> . 10at-her <dig> cells and the established skbr <dig> breast cancer cell line express generally similar levels of her <dig> protein; however, the 10at-her <dig> cells form tumorspheres and tumor xenografts at significantly lower cell numbers compared to skbr <dig> cells. thus, the level of her <dig> protein per se is not the singular determining factor for the generation of the cancer stem/progenitor cell-like character of our newly developed breast cancer model system. conceivably a combination of her <dig> signaling and the components constituting the preneoplastic phenotype caused the emergence of cells enriched with cancer stem/progenitor cell-like properties in the 10at-her <dig> cell population.

we observed that 10at-her <dig> cells are highly sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of i3c, a natural indole carbinol compound. i3c was shown to trigger a p53-dependent apoptotic response in 10at-her <dig> cells and can disrupt tumorsphere formation in cell suspension cultures as well as inhibit the in vivo growth of 10at-her2-derived tumor xenografts. because the 10at-her <dig> cell population expresses relatively high levels of nucleostemin, this system was used to determine whether this breast cancer stem/progenitor marker protein can be potentially targeted by and confer selective responsiveness to i3c. nucleostemin is a multidomain nucleolus gtpase, which is associated with self-renewal of undifferentiated stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . co-immunoprecipitations revealed that i3c treatment of 10at-her <dig> cells strongly promoted nucleostemin binding to the mdm <dig> inhibitor of the p <dig> tumor suppressor, and thereby sequestered mdm <dig> into the nucleolus. although i3c decreased the amount of p-mdm <dig>  this natural indole carbinol compound appears to increase significantly the binding efficiency between phosphorylated mdm <dig> and nucleostemin. an important consequence of the induced nucleostemin–mdm <dig> interaction is that i3c treatment prevented mdm <dig> binding to p <dig>  which we propose allows the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein to escape the mdm <dig> inhibition and initiate its cellular apoptotic response . we also observed the i3c-regulated nucleostemin–mdm <dig> as well as mdm2–p <dig> interactions occur in skbr <dig> breast cancer cells, but not in either mcf- <dig> or mda-mb- <dig> cells even though all three of these human breast cancer cell lines are sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of i3c. conceivably, the attenuated stemness properties of mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells may account for this difference in i3c-regulated protein–protein interaction properties. consistent with this pathway mediating the anti-proliferative effects of i3c, expression of dominant negative p <dig> prevented the i3c apoptotic response in 10at-her <dig> cells, whereas knockdown of nucleostemin disrupted the i3c-induced localization of mdm <dig> into nuclear foci as well as strongly attenuated the apoptotic response. i3c did not alter the protein level of nucleostemin, mdm <dig> or p <dig>  implying that the key effects are on protein–protein interactions and subcellular localization .figure  <dig> 
proposed model of the elastase-dependent i3c anti-proliferative cascade that targets and requires nucleostemin.  in proliferative cells in the absence of i3c, the elastase cleavage of cd <dig> triggers signaling through traf <dig> that results in activated akt phosphorylation of mdm <dig>  as a result, mdm <dig> interacts with both the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of p <dig> and thereby prevents the apoptotic activity of this tumor suppressor protein. under these proliferative conditions, nucleostemin remains in a nucleolus compartment.  i3c inhibits the elastase cleavage of cd <dig> and thereby disrupts the cd40–traf <dig> interaction and inhibits signaling through traf <dig>  which results in the loss of mdm <dig> phosphorylation. the non-phosphorylated mdm <dig> and phosphorylated mdm <dig> are sequestered into the nucleolus by their interaction with nucleostemin, which then releases p <dig> to mediate its apoptotic response. the i3c anti-proliferative cascade is disrupted by expression of an i3c-resistant form of elastase, by the sirna knockdown of nucleostemin, or by the expression of a dominant negative p <dig>  i3c, indole-3-carbinol; mdm <dig>  murine double mutant 2; ns, nucleostemin; traf <dig>  tumor necrosis factor receptor activator factor- <dig> 



knockdown studies of nucleostemin have been controversial as to whether nucleostemin has a cancer promoting or an anti-cancer effect. it appears that the cellular role of nucleostemin is likely to vary in a cell-type-specific manner. consistent with our observations, the aberrant expression of nucleostemin activates p <dig> and induces cell cycle arrest via inhibition of mdm <dig>  <cit> , whereas, depletion of nucleostemin destabilized mdm <dig> and induced a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest  <cit> . relatively little is known about the functional significance of nucleostemin–mdm <dig> interactions  <cit> . our observations provide the first direct evidence that anti-proliferative signaling by i3c can promote specific interactions of the breast cancer stem/progenitor cell marker protein nucleostemin with the mdm <dig> inhibitor of p <dig>  it is interesting to note that the presence of nucleostemin per se is not sufficient to sequester mdm <dig> into nucleolus foci because the sequestration of mdm <dig> is only observed after i3c treatment, even though nucleolus-localized nucleostemin was detected in 10at-her <dig> cells regardless of i3c treatment. we did not observe changes in the total level of p <dig> protein in several experimental contexts, and our results suggest that the loss of mdm <dig> accessibility to p <dig> frees p <dig> to trigger its apoptotic response. the mdm <dig> interaction with p <dig> was partially reversed in i3c-treated cells after knockdown of nucleostemin, suggesting that in the absence of nucleostemin, mdm <dig> can still interact with p <dig>  although at lower efficiency. it is tempting to speculate that i3c-induced signaling pathways may target nucleostemin and/or mdm <dig> as a priming mechanism that enhances the nucleostemin–mdm <dig> protein–protein interaction. consistent with this possibility, i3c treatment significantly reduced the level of phosphorylated mdm <dig>  which in other systems can influence mdm2–p <dig> interactions  <cit> . phosphorylation of mdm <dig> at ser <dig> by akt <dig> is critical in maintaining the mdm2–p <dig> interaction  <cit> . our preliminary evidence shows that transfection with constitutively active akt <dig> reversed the loss of mdm <dig> phosphorylation in the presence of i3c, prevented the observed apoptotic response and attenuated the i3c-induced interaction of mdm <dig> with nucleostemin.

we previously established that elastase is the biologically relevant indole carbinol target protein in breast cancer cells and the noncompetitive inhibition of elastase enzymatic activity by i3c, and other i3c-based derivatives, triggers a shift from cell survival signaling to apoptotic signaling by altering the signaling through downstream elastase substrates, such as the cd <dig> member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family  <cit> . the elastase cleaved form of cd <dig> directly interacts with a specific set of downstream effectors  to activate cell survival signaling cascades, whereas the uncleaved form of cd <dig> interacts with a different set of trafs to initiate an apoptotic response  <cit> . the requirement for elastase in i3c apoptotic signaling in 10at-her <dig> cells was established by expressing the wt elastase or a novel i3c-resistant truncated form of elastase, which remains highly enzymatically active but resistant to the inhibitory effects of i3c  <cit> . co-immunoprecipitations showed that in the presence of the wt elastase, i3c treatment released the cd <dig> binding with traf <dig>  which is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase responsible for the recruitment of active akt <dig> to the plasma membrane  <cit> . in the presence of the i3c-resistant elastase, cd <dig> is cleaved in the presence or absence of i3c and traf <dig> remained associated with cd <dig> under both conditions. also, in cells expressing the i3c-resistant elastase, treatment with i3c failed to stimulate the mdm2–nucleostemin or inhibit the mdm2–p <dig> bimolecular interactions, and prevented i3c from triggering its apoptotic response in cell cultures or to inhibit growth of 10at-her <dig> cell-derived tumor xenografts. therefore, we propose that in 10at-her <dig> cells, which are highly enriched with cells with stem/progenitor cell-like properties, the i3c apoptotic response is triggered by the inhibition elastase and requires the downstream protein–protein interactions of nucleostemin, a stem/progenitor cell marker protein .

CONCLUSIONS
an intriguing potential clinical significance of our mechanistic studies is the potential development of i3c-based compounds in new therapeutic strategies that block the emergence and maintenance of stem/progenitor cell populations within breast cancers by inducing a nucleostemin-dependent apoptotic response. our pre-clinical characterization of the mechanism of action of i3c has shown that the nucleostemin stem/progenitor cell marker protein is essential for the anti-proliferative response of this indole carbinol compound. given that i3c anti-proliferative signaling requires the presence of wt elastase, which is the only identified direct target protein for i3c, conceivably cancer stem/progenitor cell populations in breast cancers that express both elastase and nucleostemin should be highly sensitive to this indole carbinol compound. in this regard, many advanced-stage breast cancers express high levels of elastase or elastase activity  <cit> , and it is tempting to consider that the detection of elastase activity in biopsies could eventually lead to the use of i3c-based compounds for individual patients. prior to the development of personalized therapies, a critical issue will be to determine whether the cancer stem/progenitor cells that exist in early and/or advanced breast tumors produce high enough levels of elastase and nucleostemin to be sensitive to i3c and its highly potent derivatives. the 10at-her <dig> cell line, which has a stable phenotype and is highly enriched with cells that display breast cancer stem/progenitor cell-like properties, will be used to characterize the precise functional role of signal-regulated alterations in nucleostemin–protein interactions that are part of the anti-proliferative response to i3c, and can be employed to assess the efficiency by which other classes of anti-cancer agents can target specific stem/progenitor cell components in cancer cell populations.

advanced-stage breast cancers are notoriously difficult to treat but generally possess high levels of wt elastase, the direct target protein that triggers i3c anti-proliferative signaling. therefore, the broader community-focused significance of our pre-clinical work is the potential to develop low-cost i3c-based compounds as potential cancer stem/progenitor cell-targeted treatment options for women impacted by highly aggressive and metastatic breast cancers.
