BACKGROUND
interspecific hybridization occurs frequently in plants ; hybrid swarms or hybrid zones provide a window through which to examine species cohesiveness, interspecific gene flow and hybrid fitness  <cit> . however, it is still hotly debated how such hybrid zones are maintained, mainly because of conflicting views about the relative role of selection versus gene flow in driving or homogenizing divergence  <cit> . up to now, three types – tension zones, bounded hybrid superiority zones, and mosaic hybrid zones – have been tentatively suggested, based on theoretical and empirical studies of how selection acts on hybrids and parent species  <cit> . within tension zones, hybrids are of low fitness relative to parent species and hybrid zones are restricted to a narrow area between the two parents and are mainly maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids  <cit> . the bounded hybrid superiority  model assumes that hybrids are fitter than their parents in intermediate habitats, but less fit than parent species in their respective native habitats . gene flow can also be prevented if hybridization proceeds only to the f <dig> stage and no further, which can occur due to apparent habitat-mediated superiority of f1s over other hybrid classes  <cit> . these hybrid zones probably occupy distinct habitats located in an intermediate position, where the ranges of the two parent species overlap. finally, the mosaic hybrid zone model hypothesizes that patchy environments within the overlapping region of two parent species are highly heterogeneous  <cit> . therefore, hybrids comprise a mosaic of diverse genotypes that are highly variable according to their respective distributions. in such a model, both environment-independent and -dependent selections against hybrids co-exist, thus combining the hypotheses of both the tension zone model and the bounded hybrid superiority model. whichever model applies, it is very important to know the genetic composition of such hybrid zones, with regard to genotype frequencies, before we can identify the factors that may contribute to maintaining these hybrid populations as a result of either intrinsic or extrinsic fitness.

hybridization and gene flow between species occur extensively in the genus populus, resulting in numerous natural hybrid zones . in both europe  <cit>  and north america  <cit> , the origins of numerous such hybrids have been explored. some natural poplar hybrid zones contain a mix of f1s, post-f1s  and further backcross genotypes with diverse levels of fitness , consistent with a combination of the hybrid tension and superiority hypotheses. moreover, some natural poplar hybrid zones play a significant role in bridging or preventing gene flow between hybridizing species . however, little attention has, so far, been paid to natural hybrids occurring in asia. in this study, we aimed to examine the genetic origin, composition and possible maintenance of the hybrid between populus nigra and p. laurifolia at numerous locations in western china. populus nigra, the black poplar of sect. aigeiros, is mainly found in europe and has limited ranges in central asia and northwest africa  <cit> . it is, however, a tree of social and economic importance  <cit> . in western china, it occurs on wet slopes beside rivers at altitudes between 400 m and 1000 m  <cit> . in contrast, p. laurifolia of sect. tacamahaca occurs mainly in northern asia, with its range extending into central asia  <cit> . this species grows on the mountainous slopes of river valleys in western china; it prefers relatively dry habitats at altitudes between 400 m and 1800 m  <cit> . despite their distant relationship, as revealed in all phylogenetic studies  <cit> , these two poplars co-occur in xinjiang, western china. both of them flower and set seed from april to may  <cit> . however, these two species differ from each other with respect to numerous characters from leaves to branches and flowers  <cit> . both species are dioecious, with pollen dispersed by wind and seeds dispersed by wind and water  <cit> . they also propagate vegetatively from broken branches and cuttings  <cit> . due to their overlapping distributions and flowering periods in western china, a hybrid, p. × jrtyschensis, was assumed to result from crosses between these two distantly related poplars in xinjiang  <cit> . this hybrid and its two putative parent species are diploid with 2n =  <dig>  <cit> . it annually sets numerous seeds with unknown fertility  <cit> . this hybrid poplar has an intermediate morphology between p. nigra and p. laurifolia, although the overall morphology seems to be more similar to the former than the latter  <cit> . p. × jrtyschensis forms pure forests in numerous locations on the floodplains along the erqis river valley, where neither parent species is present  <cit> . in addition, this hybrid poplar has been introduced and widely cultivated along agricultural drainage channels, by means of cuttings taken from wild populations, because of its fast growth, straight stems and the other superior characteristics compared to the putative parent species  <cit> .

in addition to the morphological evidence, genetic evidence based on sequence variations from its and chloroplast dna  from samples of several individuals of most species found in xinjiang has also suggested that p. × jrtyschensis probably originated from hybridizations between these two distantly related species  <cit> . we extended the example to include more natural populations of p. × jrtyschensis and its two putative parental species for the present study. we genotyped a total of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations of three taxa  based on sequence variations of the maternally inherited cpdna and polymorphisms generated by  <dig> nuclear simple sequence repeat  markers. we also sequenced eight nuclear genes for  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations. in this study, we mainly aimed to test the following hypotheses. first, p. × jrtyschensis originated through hybridization from two distantly related poplar species. this was investigated by examining cpdna sequence variations and conducting coalescent analyses of genetic polymorphisms from  <dig> ssr and eight nuclear genes. second, all examined populations of p. × jrtyschensis have the same hybrid genetic compositions probably comprised of f1s, despite their mosaic distributions due to the relative stability in the morphology of all p. × jrtyschensis populations. finally, habitat-selection contributed to the formation of these hybrid swarms and maintained them  because the floodplains where p. × jrtyschensis occurs is obviously poorer than the habitats of the two putative parent species. in order to confirm this, we measured and compared the soil nitrogen concentrations in typical habitats of the three taxa.fig.  <dig> distribution of haplotypes within the three populus species. a median-joining network among plastid dna haplotypes present in p. nigra, p. laurifolia and p. × jrtyschensis. each sector of a circle is proportional to the frequency of each species in each haplotype. colors of circles in  indicate the species present at a site. in  the sectors of circles indicate the frequency of a haplotype in a population at that site



RESULTS
sequence variation of chloroplast dna
thirteen substitutions were detected at the rbcl gene across the  <dig> individuals sampled. these mutations together revealed eight haplotypes , which clustered into two major groups : one comprising h <dig> and the other consisting of h <dig>  h <dig> and h5-h <dig>  based on the sequence variations, h <dig> originated from the recombination of two dominant haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig> of the two major groups. most individuals of p. nigra and p. laurifolia were found to be fixed into a separate group of haplotypes according to species. for example, h <dig> was associated with most individuals of p. nigra but only one individual of p. laurifolia. in contrast, most individuals of p. laurifolia were h <dig>  while this haplotype was found for only seven individuals of p. nigra. in addition, a few rare haplotypes  were found to be mainly associated with p. laurifolia. the individuals of p. × jrtyschensis that we examined were found to be represented by five haplotypes of both groups, h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  around 94 % of the individuals of p. × jrtyschensis were found to have the haplotypes mainly associated with p. laurifolia while 6 % were h <dig>  which is mainly found in p. nigra. genetic partitions estimated by amova based on these haplotypes revealed that between-population variation was significant and accounted for 34 % of the total variation in p. nigra, but was not significant in p. laurifolia where it accounted for only 6 % of the total variation. between-population differentiation associated with cpdna sequence variation was significant in p. × jrtyschensis and accounted for 28 % of the total variation .table  <dig> analyses of molecular variance  for three poplar species based on datasets for two markers

genetic diversity and structure analyses based on eight nuclear genes
sequence variation and genetic diversity across the eight nuclear loci were both larger in p. × jrtyschensis than in the other two species . private single-nucleotide polymorphisms  for each parent species were recovered at each locus, with shared snps being more common between p. × jrtyschensis and p. nigra than between p. × jrtyschensis and p. laurifolia . both pcas of samples and the nnet tree constructed for all samples suggested a hybrid origin of p. × jrtyschensis . structure also revealed that when k was set to  <dig> in structure with usepopinfo =  <dig>  p. nigra and p. laurifolia individuals clustered into two separate groups, while individuals of p. × jrtyschensis were admixed, containing a mixture of the genomes of the two groups representing the putative parent species . both the pritchard et al.  <cit>  and evanno et al.  <cit>  tests indicated that the most likely number of clusters for the entire data set was k =  <dig>  genetic divergence between the three taxa further indicated that p. × jrtyschensis was a hybrid, in that divergence between p. × jrtyschensis and either p. nigra or p. laurifolia was similar, while pairwise Φst values for comparisons between p. × jrtyschensis and either p. nigra or p. laurifolia were lower than between p. nigra and p. laurifolia  . in each taxa, the positive values for both tajima’s d and fu & li’s d and f were estimated for half of the nuclear loci and negative for the others .table  <dig> distribution of segregating sites at nuclear loci in pairwise comparisons of taxa: p. nigra, p. × jrtyschensis and p. laurifolia

genetic diversity and structure analyses based on ssr loci
the alleles per locus and the estimated genetic indexes for each of the three taxa were listed in . allelic richness at each locus was higher in p. × jrtyschensis than p. nigra or p. laurifolia . both pcas for samples from the three taxa and the nnet tree constructed for all samples based on genetic distance suggested that p. × jrtyschensis was located between p. nigra and p. laurifolia, with a closer affinity with the former than the latter. the p. × jrtyschensis cluster was clear , but both the pritchard et al.  <cit>  and evanno et al.  <cit>  tests indicated that the most likely number of clusters for the entire data set was k =  <dig>  when k was artificially set to  <dig>  all individuals of p. × jrtyschensis were admixed, with a mixture of the genomes of the two groups representing the two parent species .fig.  <dig> genetic clustering of all individuals of p. nigra, p. laurifolia and p. × jrtyschensis. a principal component analysis , b neighbornet , and c population cluster analysis using structure  based on nuclear gene dataset; d principal component analysis , e neighbornet , and f population cluster analysis using structure  based on ssr datasets



test of the hybrid origin and hybrid composition of p. × jrtyschensis based on population genetic data from  <dig> ssrs and eight nuclear genes
we tested three alternative divergence hypotheses for the three taxa based on ssr and nuclear gene data sets separately . our abc modeling results revealed that the hybrid origin model  provided a better fit for the observed data than scenarios  <dig> and  <dig>  the posterior probabilities of scenarios  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were, respectively,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ssrs and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the nuclear sequence dataset . we tested hybrid composition criteria based on newhybrids estimates suggested by anderson and thompson  <cit>  using ssr and nuclear gene data sets. for ssrs, 95 % of the sampled individuals under p. nigra and 99 % of the sampled individuals under p. laurifolia were pure. in total, 84 % of the sampled individuals of p. × jrtyschensis were considered to be f <dig> hybrids between pure p. nigra and p. laurifolia. in addition, 6 % of individuals are backcrosses with one of the parents, while it is difficult to ascribe the remaining individuals . similarly, based on sequence variations of nuclear genes,  <dig> and 100 % of the sampled individuals under p. nigra or p. laurifolia were found to be pure. in addition, 87 % of the sampled individuals of p. × jrtyschensis were considered to be f <dig> hybrids while 9 % of them seems to be backcrosses with one of the parents and the remaining individuals were difficult to ascribe. only two individuals from one population were found to have the same marked polymorphisms at all  <dig> ssr loci, suggesting that they derived from the same clone. no single clone was found in any two different populations.fig.  <dig> estimated posterior probabilities for each individual being pure parents, f <dig>  f <dig> and backcross genotypes. the height of the column for each individual represents the probability of a single frequency class. an individual was considered assigned if the probability of a single frequency class exceeded 90 %



based on ssr data sets, gene flow  was estimated to be greater from p. laurifolia and p. nigra  than in the opposite direction . gene flow occurred more frequently between p. × jrtyschensis and the two parent species. more gene flow occurred from p. laurifolia to p. × jrtyschensis  than in the reverse direction  while less was detected from p. nigra  to p. × jrtyschensis than in the reverse direction . the same trend was observed based on nuclear genes: gene flow was estimated to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  separately from p. laurifolia to p. nigra, from p. nigra to p. × jrtyschensis and from p. × jrtyschensis to p. laurifolia, respectively, and in the opposite direction it was estimated to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . in all directions, rates of gene flow estimated for the ssr data set were greater than those based on nuclear gene sequence data .

soil nitrogen analyses of typical habitats for three taxa
total soil nitrogen concentration of typical habitats of p. × jrtyschensis differed from those of the two parent species. the typical habitats of p. × jrtyschensis had lower nitrogen concentrations at depths of 0–20 cm, 20–40 cm and 40–70 cm than the habitats of the two parent species . in addition, we found that soil nitrogen concentrations were significantly different between p. × jrtyschensis habitats and the habitats of the two parent species, with higher probabilities for the greater depths .

discussion
in this study, we used  <dig> ssr markers, eight nuclear gene markers and cpdna sequence variations to genotype  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations of p. × jrtyschensis, p. nigra and p. laurifolia. in addition to the intermediate morphology of the hybrid compared to the two putative parents  <cit> , our genetic results provided further support for the hypothesis that p. × jrtyschensis originated from hybridizations between the distantly related species p. nigra and p. laurifolia. our reasons for this conclusion are as follows. first, the detected alleles for each individual of p. × jrtyschensis were admixed with the clusters specific to the putative parent species. that the species-specific alleles co-occurred in one taxa undoubtedly suggested its hybrid origin  <cit> . this scenario has been confirmed in some case study of hybrid taxa  <cit> . second, abc analyses supported the hybrid origin hypothesis for p. × jrtyschensis while the alternative hypotheses suggesting divergences from one of the two parent species were rejected . finally, two distinct cpdna lineages were recovered for p. nigra and p. laurifolia respectively while both of them co-occurred in p. × jrtyschensis. two divergent maternal lineages from putative parents have also been reported for other hybrid taxa  <cit> . these lines of evidence together supported the hypothesis that p. × jrtyschensis originated from hybridizations between p. nigra and p. laurifolia.fig.  <dig> scenarios that were tested for the origin of p. × jrtyschensis , p. nigra  and p. laurifolia . n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> represent current effective population sizes of p. nigra, p. laurifolia and p. × jrtyschensis, respectively. for scenarios 1– <dig>  t <dig> is the time of origin of p. × jrtyschensis. t <dig> represents divergence time between p. nigra and p. laurifolia in “generations ago” and na is the effective population size of the common ancestor of the three species



further, we found that most of the populations of p. × jrtyschensis that we examined comprised f <dig> hybrids with a few backcrosses with each of the two parent species, although clonal reproduction did occur in some of them. these findings did not support the other two original hypotheses regarding the intermediate but stable morphology of p. × jrtyschensis, namely that they either derived from a few clonal lineages or had developed into a stable homoploid hybrid species. however, in a typical hybrid zone, f1s usually comprise a very small number of the individuals present  <cit> . relatively few hybrid zones have been reported to be dominated by f1s; those that were known include encelia × laciniata  <cit> , the hybrid zone between black oaks  <cit> , rhododendron × sochadzeae  <cit>  and rhododendron agastum  <cit> . a predominance of f1s has rarely been found in hybrid swarms between other populus species and most hybrid swarms contain f1s, f2s as well as backcrosses . in a previous study  <cit> , only f1s were detected between p. deltoides and p. nigra, possibly due to their distant relationship and strong reproductive isolation. according to our field observations, p. × jrtyschensis produced numerous seeds. however, it remains unknown whether these seeds germinate. we also failed to find young seedlings from the habitat of p. × jrtyschensis, which seems to support the conclusion that the populations of p. × jrtyschensis mainly comprise f1s. because we did detect backcross hybrids  with both p. nigra and p. laurifolia, pollen-stigma incompatibility is unlikely to account for the general absence of the post-f1s in most of the populations of p. × jrtyschensis that we examined. however, introgressions between p. nigra and p. laurifolia are relatively small according to our estimations based on the nuclear dataset  despite the fact that these f1s might have resulted from the repeated hybridizations between two parental species.fig.  <dig> gene flow for all three species pairs. gene flow for all three species pairs is represented by arrows. figures beside the arrows indicate the population migration rate 



the presence of these mosaic hybrid populations consisting mainly of f1s suggests two alternative origins: a recent contact between two parental species only one generation ago without enough time for post-f <dig> derivatives to have been produced or that these f1s may exclude other genotypes from the hybrid habitats  <cit> . numerous individuals of each examined population are at least 50 years old according to rough estimates based on their large stems compared with other poplars encountered during our field surveys. although accurate data on flowering age of p. × jrtyschensis are not available, this should be similar to other poplars, i.e. between  <dig> and 30 years  <cit> . therefore, most genets of each population should have existed long enough for post-f <dig> progeny to have been produced. thus, it appears that the p. × jrtyschensis populations comprise stable and long-lived hybrid zones dominated by f1s, and other genotypes were excluded because of the habitat selection. the distributional preferences of p. × jrtyschensis and the two parent species also support this habitat-selection suggestion. at a local scale, p. × jrtyschensis is parapatric, rather than strictly sympatric to the two parent species. one of the parent species, p. nigra, was found on wet slopes adjacent to rivers, whilst the other, p. laurifolia, was found on dry mountainous slopes; in contrast, p. × jrtyschensis occurs exclusively on the floodplains. three examined sites with p. × jrtyschensis were found to be nutrient-poor with low concentrations of the total soil nitrogen, especially in the deeper layers . such differentiations of the habitat preferences have also been noted between some hybrid taxa and their respective parental species for other plant genera  <cit> . the habitat-mediated selection may have prevented other genotypes  from germination and surviving in the floodplains occupied by p. × jrtyschensis. in addition, new and recent hybridizations between two parental species may have continuously produced more f1s to repopulate the p. × jrtyschensis hybrid zones. it is highly likely that habitat-mediated selection as well as repeated productions of the f1s between two parental species have together maintained the unique f <dig> hybrid zones detected here.fig.  <dig> comparisons of soil nitrogen concentration at each depth for the three taxa’s sites. error bars represent se. pj, p. × jrtyschensis; pn, p. nigra; and pl, p. laurifolia. significant differences in soil nitrogen concentration at each depth for the sites representing the habitat of each of the three taxa as revealed by anova: ns not significant, p >  <dig> ; *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> 



although direct comparisons of fitness between f1s and f2s or further backcrosses with either parent are rarely undertaken  <cit> , a higher fitness for f1s is theoretically likely. complete gene sets from both parents are present in f1s, and heterosis and hybrid vigor undoubtedly persist without hybrid breakdown  <cit> . all beneficial traits conferred through the co-adapted gene complexes from two parents can be passed intact to the f <dig> generation, but not to post-f1s because such gene complexes are likely to be broken down. therefore, if some of these co-adapted gene complexes confer a benefit to f1s through heterosis when occupying new niches, then these effects will be reduced in post-f1s due to the lower proportion of heterozygous loci, reflecting post-mating reproductive isolation between highly divergent species. however, increased fitness in the post-f1s could derive from transgressive segregations, which give rise to beneficial traits that do not exist in the parent species, in homoploid hybrid neospecies or in plants developing into independent lineages  <cit> . theoretically, some post-f1s are likely to develop superior traits over f1s to occupy novel or arid habitats in places that do not favor f1s, but which neither of the parents are adapted to. this may be true for p. × jrtyschensis although the predominance of f1s in the patchy habitat prevents further segregations. in addition, the backcross frequencies observed here are extremely low, although we could not exclude the possibility that this was the result of widespread and strong genomic incompatibility between these highly divergent species. it is also likely that further backcross hybridizations were excluded by unfavorable epistatic combinations that led to unfit progeny. all these hypotheses and those suggesting higher fitness of the f1s than f2s, bcs and parents need further artificially controlled tests especially in the soils with the limited nitrogen concentration, as have recently been undertaken for spruce hybrids  <cit> , before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that p. × jrtyschensis is typical of f1-dominated hybrid zones between the distantly related species p. nigra and p. laurifolia. habitat-mediated selection due to f <dig> superiority as well as continuous production of the more f1s due to the repeated hybridizations between two parental specie are likely to have maintained these hybrid populations. therefore, the formation of p. × jrtyschensis hybrid zones is largely consistent with the environment-dependent bounded hybrid superiority hypothesis. in addition, because of the absence of a basic difference in the genetic composition between the populations of p. × jrtyschensis examined, individuals for cultivation of this hybrid poplar can be obtained from vegetative cuttings from any natural population.
