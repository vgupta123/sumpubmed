BACKGROUND
massively parallel cdna sequencing  is gradually superseding microarrays in quantitative gene expression profiling  <cit> . apart from its ability to detect novel transcripts, splicing events, and sequence variations, rna-seq offers unparalleled precise detection of gene expression over a wide dynamic range  <cit> . due to declining costs of sequencing, further increase in the use of rna-seq is expected. however, several methodological  <cit>  and statistical  <cit>  issues in the design and analyses of rna-seq experiments remain unresolved. biologists, who plan rna-seq experiments, often pose questions on sample size requirements, cost-effective strategies for sample pooling, and on the choice of data analysis software. current literature on this topic  do not provide unequivocal answers to these important questions  <cit> .

diverse methods are available to align rna-seq reads  <cit> , summarize read counts, assemble transcripts  <cit> , and to detect differential expression between biological conditions  <cit> . differentially expressed gene  analysis methods differ on their normalisation procedures, detection of differential isoform expression, statistical modelling, variance estimation, and corrections for multiple testing  <cit> . this research focussed on four commonly used deg analysis methods, cuffdiff <dig>  <cit> , edger  <cit> , deseq <dig>  <cit> , and two-stage poisson model   <cit> . it minimised the variations, secondary to read alignment and counting, by employing the same spliced aligner   <cit>  and counting algorithm   <cit>  for all methods, except for cuffdiff <dig> that requires a unique quantification method, cufflinks  <cit> . we analysed data, derived from a rna-seq experiment including rna samples, extracted from amygdalae micro-punches of a genetically modified mouse strain  and of their wild-type  littermates , with cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and tspm. validation using independent biological replicates is preferred over in silico analyses, using online databases or simulated datasets, as well as technical validation, using the same rna samples, to confirm true-positive degs between two or more biological conditions  <cit> . hence, we validated the differential expression of  <dig> genes, randomly selected from the list of degs that were identified by the four methods, using independent biological replicates and high-throughput quantitative reverse-transcription pcr .

pooling biological replicate rna samples, such as those derived from a number of experimentally similar animals, may retain the biological information, while reducing the cost of sequencing. validity and utility of sample pooling for gene expression analyses using microarrays have been evaluated extensively . biological averaging hypothesis suggests reduced biological variability and increased power to detect degs  <cit> , but a pooling bias, that is the difference between the value measured in the pool and the mean of the values measured in the corresponding individual replicates, can occur  <cit> . although several rna-seq experiments, based on pooled samples of rna, have identified degs  <cit> , the validity of pooling for rna-seq experiments to detect degs has not been systematically evaluated so far. hence, we evaluated the validity of two pooling strategies  against the reference standard of sequencing the corresponding individual samples  to detect degs.

RESULTS
validity of deg analysis methods
we performed differential gene expression analysis of data from a rna-seq experiment using cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and tspm. after benjamini-hochberg false discovery correction, genes with adjusted p values less than  <dig>  were considered as degs for all methods. figure  <dig> presents the agreement between the four analysis methods.  <dig> degs were identified in total. cuffdiff <dig> detected more degs than the other methods, while deseq <dig> identified only brd <dig> as a deg. none of the degs was identified by any three of these methods . spearman correlation coefficients between the logarithmic  fold changes in expression , estimated by these methods, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   . however, the range of estimated fold changes varied, especially for the genes that were expressed in only one group . cuffdiff <dig> assigned infinite values for the lfc of the genes, expressed in only one group, while the other three methods estimated values ranging from  <dig> to ± <dig> for them. the digital expression count matrix  and complete cuffdiff <dig> , deseq <dig>  and tspm  analyses are included as additional data files with the online version of this paper. edger results will be published elsewhere. among  <dig> randomly selected genes from the list of  <dig> degs, detected by cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and tspm,  <dig> were replicated in biological independent rna samples by qpcr, while other  <dig> failed replication . table  <dig> presents the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and tspm, assuming qpcr as the reference standard. deseq <dig> was the most specific , but the least sensitive method . cuffdiff <dig> identified more than half  of the true-positive degs, but contributed 87 % of the false positive degs. edger displayed the best sensitivity  and overall agreement with a false positivity rate of 9 %. tspm had specificity, comparable to edger , but showed a false negativity rate of 95 %. positive predictive values of cuffdiff <dig>  deseq <dig>  edger, and tspm were  <dig>  %, 100 %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, respectively. combining edger and cuffdiff <dig> analyses in parallel enhanced sensitivity to  <dig>  %, but their net specificity was only  <dig>  %. spearman correlation coefficients between the lfcs, estimated by qpcr, and those estimated by edger, cuffdiff <dig>  deseq <dig> and tspm were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  . root-mean-square deviation accuracies of edger, cuffdiff <dig>  deseq <dig> and tspm with reference to qpcr lfc were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.fig.  <dig> agreement between four different methods for deg analysis of rna-seq data. a intersections between degs, which were detected by cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and two-stage poisson model , after benjamini-hochberg false discovery correction at 5 %. b-g pairwise comparisons of logarithmic  fold changes  in expression that were estimated by cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and tspm: b edger and cuffdiff2; c edger and deseq2; d edger and tspm; e cuffdiff <dig> and tspm; f cuffdiff <dig> and deseq2; g tspm and deseq2; spearman correlation coefficients  are included in each graph. rna samples were obtained from amygdalae micro-punches of female mice, heterozygous for a targeted deletion in the brd <dig> gene on a congenic c57bl/6ntac background and of their wt littermates

validity of rna pooling for deg analyses
rna-seq data from rna-pools were analysed by edger  and the results were compared with edger analyses of rna-seq data from the corresponding individual rna samples. figure  <dig> presents this comparison. analyses detected  <dig> and  <dig> degs in 3-sample and 8-sample pools of rna, respectively. differential expression of most of these genes was not corroborated by the analyses of corresponding individual samples. agreement between the analyses of rna-pools and of corresponding individual samples was weak . table  <dig> presents the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the two pooling strategies, assuming the edger analyses of the corresponding individual samples as the reference standard. despite having good sensitivity  and specificity , both pooling strategies displayed poor positive predictive values , which undermined their ability to predict true-positive degs. adding eight , instead of three , biological replicates to the rna-pool significantly improved the correlation between the lfc, estimated by the analyses of pooled and the corresponding individual samples . we repeated similar analyses with cuffdiff <dig> , and replicated poor positive predictive values of both pooling strategies .fig.  <dig> agreement between sequencing rna-pools and sequencing corresponding individual rna samples. a intersection between differentially expressed genes , detected by edger, in rna-seq data from pooled rna  and of data from corresponding individual samples of rna . rectangle represents all expressed genes. b correlation between the logarithmic  fold changes  in expression that were estimated by sequencing rna-pools  and by sequencing corresponding individual samples . c intersection between the degs, detected by edger, in rna-seq data from pooled rna  and of data from corresponding individual samples of rna . rectangle represents all expressed genes. d correlation between the lfc in expression that were estimated by sequencing rna-pools  and by sequencing corresponding individual samples

discussion
our findings revealed that false positivity rate of cuffdiff <dig> and false negativity rates of deseq <dig> and tspm were high. contrary to previous studies that supported the validity of rna sample pooling for microarray based analyses of gene expression  <cit> , we documented the pooling bias in estimating differential gene expression, and high false positivity rate to detect degs for rna-seq experiments employing pooling of low amount rna samples from brain micro-punches. our results corroborated previous studies, which indicated low sensitivity of deseq  <cit> , high false positivity of cuffdiff  <cit> , and high sensitivity of edger  <cit> . false positivity and false negativity rates of tspm have been reported to be dependent on the number of replicates  <cit> . this study did not evaluate the issues concerning read alignment  <cit> , read counting  <cit> , transcript assembly  <cit> , and many novel deg analysis methods  <cit> . it included rna samples, expected to be highly variable on their gene expression profiles, since amygdalae comprise multiple functionally distinct nuclei  <cit> , and micro-punching of such regions in mouse brain is inherently imprecise.

differences between the deg analysis methods begin with their normalisation procedures  <cit> . edger uses a model, which incorporates normalisation factors as offsets that are estimated by trimmed mean of m values for each contig  <cit> . deseq <dig> employs a relative log expression method  <cit> . normalisation procedures for cuffdiff <dig> consider total number of reads, gene length, variability within and between the conditions, and differential isoform expression  <cit> . tspm can accommodate various normalisation procedures, but works without normalisation by default  <cit> . it assumes poisson distribution for the genes that are not over-dispersed. edger and deseq <dig> model negative binomial distribution, while cuffdiff <dig> follow beta negative binomial model to accommodate ambiguously mapped reads  <cit> . principal source of variability between these methods is their dispersion estimation procedures  <cit> . deseq <dig> is stringent to detect outliers and excludes genes with extreme read counts by default  <cit> . it considers the maximum a posteriori dispersion estimates, while edger moderates its dispersion estimates by their dispersion-mean relationship  <cit> . cuffdiff <dig> includes covariances between different isoforms  <cit> . tspm differs by its per-gene dispersion estimation without considering the information across genes  <cit> . several unique correction procedures, such as multi-read correction, bias correction and effective length correction, are incorporated only in cufflinks <dig> and cuffdiff <dig>  <cit> . edger, deseq <dig> and cuffdiff <dig> calculate their p values by the generalized linear model  likelihood ratio test  <cit> , glm wald test  <cit>  and t-test  <cit> , respectively. tspm employs quasi or standard likelihood ratio tests, based on whether a gene is over-dispersed or not. cuffdiff is more likely to estimate false positive statistically significant p values, when the gene expression is detected in only one group  <cit> .

our results favour the use of edger, among the four investigated methods, and discourage using rna pooling in future rna-seq experiments. pooled samples do not represent the population variations in gene expression levels, and they cannot estimate within population variation  <cit> . within-group variances of the pooled samples are less than true within-group variances of the individual samples. this leads to erroneously long deg lists with low positive predictive values that limit practical use. if researchers plan rna pooling because of saving costs or of limited starting material, stringent false discovery corrections and high-throughput validation of as many identified degs as possible should be considered. if the validation targets are chosen by random sampling from the list of identified degs, false discovery rates can be estimated cost-effectively  <cit> . an increase in the number of biological replicates, added into each pool, may help to minimise the pooling bias in estimating differential gene expression. increasing the number of replicates is more effective to improve the power to detect degs than increasing sequencing depth above  <dig> million reads per sample  <cit> . limiting sequencing depth to  <dig> million reads per sample can reduce the costs and can help the biologists to sequence more replicates. heterogeneity of biological variance among rna samples may be larger than the dispersion, estimated by edger  <cit> , and most contemporary rna-seq experiments have been estimated to be under-powered by their design  <cit> . hence, reducing the number of replicates by pooling will decrease the power and the ability to estimate within population variation further, and will increase pooling bias as well as false discovery rates .

although edger was the most sensitive among these four methods, it did not detect differential expression of brd <dig> that was genetically modified in these mice. employing two or more deg analysis methods in parallel can enhance the overall sensitivity to detect true-positive degs  <cit> , but consequent rise in the fdr will further increase the need for high-throughput validation of identified degs. in a hypothetical rna-seq experiment with  <dig> expressed genes,  <dig> degs, 5 % fdr 80 % power, minimum average read count of  <dig>  and maximum dispersion of  <dig> ,  <dig> replicates need to be sequenced to detect a deg with two-fold differential expression  <cit> . sample size requirement will be more, if a deg has low expression, less differential expression, and high dispersion. until such large rna-seq experiments become a reality, we cannot overemphasise the need for combined use of more sensitive deg analysis methods and of high-throughput validation of identified degs.

CONCLUSIONS
among the four investigated methods for rna-seq differential expression analyses using brain micropunches, edger detected more true-positive degs with high specificity. moreover, we demonstrated limited utility of sample pooling strategies for rna-seq in our setup. pooled samples identified degs with high false positivity rates and low positive predictive values. on the basis of our results, we conclude that combined use of more sensitive deg analysis methods and high-throughput validation of identified degs is desired for future rna-seq experiments.
