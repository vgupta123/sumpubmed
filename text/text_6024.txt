BACKGROUND
fruit softening is a complex developmental programme that involves the disassembly of various pectin and hemicellulose components of the primary cell wall, as well as alterations to cell turgor and fruit water status
 <cit> . pectin components of the cell wall are diverse, consisting of domains of contiguous  <dig> -α-linked gala residues known as homogalacturonan, and two different domains of rhamnogalacturonan
 <cit> . homogalacturonan-rich pectin is commonly found in the middle lamella region of the cell wall where two adjacent cells abut, and is believed to play a major role in intercellular adhesion
 <cit> . during fruit ripening, homogalacturonan can be depolymerised by endo-polygalacturonases , cell wall-localised enzymes that cleave stretches of unesterified gala residues and weaken the middle lamella
 <cit> . in ripe fruit, calcium cross-links between stretches of de-methylesterified gala residues of homogalacturonan provide the main bonding between adjacent cells
 <cit> .

in many species, softening during early ripening does not appear to involve pectin depolymerisation, but a correlation between pg gene expression and softening rate, together with qtl analysis, has consistently implied some involvement of pg in the softening and textural change of fleshy fruit, principally during late ripening
 <cit> . despite extensive study, the specific contribution of endo-pgs to fruit softening remains an open question - particularly since studies where pg mrna abundance and activity were directly manipulated in transgenic tomato and strawberry fruit have produced quite contrasting results.

in tomato , down-regulation of the ripening-specific slpg gene only slightly reduced the softening of the fruit
 <cit> ; and over-expression of slpg in the ripening-inhibited rin background partially restored pg activity but did not restore fruit softening
 <cit> . cell wall analysis subsequently showed that pectin depolymerisation during ripening was not prevented and was only slightly reduced in slpg-suppressed fruit
 <cit> , presumably due to the incomplete gene silencing that left ~1% of pg activity remaining
 <cit> . nevertheless, these experiments were interpreted as indicating that pg-mediated pectin depolymerisation was neither necessary nor sufficient for tomato fruit softening. however, in strawberry , down-regulation of the ripening-related fapg gene led to significantly firmer fruit
 <cit> , suggesting that pg plays a central role in strawberry fruit softening.

ripening in both tomato and strawberry is associated with a rapid loss of firmness producing a soft fruit. in contrast, fruit of other species such as water melon , asian pear  and apple  don’t soften to the same extent and are still crisp when ripe
 <cit> . the role of pgs in determining crisp fruit texture has not been directly assessed. apple possesses a pg gene  that increases in expression during fruit ripening and after exposure of apple fruit to ethylene and the cold temperature
 <cit> . over-expression of pg <dig> in apple trees led to increased intercellular separation in leaves
 <cit> , demonstrating a role for pg in the loss of intercellular adhesion. this was also suggested by ben-arie et al. <cit> , who showed that application of tomato pg to apple fruit discs caused similar ultrastructural changes to those occurring in over-ripe fruit, including dissolution of the pectin-rich middle lamella. two genetic studies have also pointed to pg as being an important determinant of apple fruit softening: a major fruit firmness-related qtl has been mapped to the pg <dig> locus on chromosome 10
 <cit>  and reduced levels of pg <dig> expression have been correlated with firmer fruit
 <cit> .

in this paper we investigate the role of pg <dig> in determining apple fruit texture by generating antisense apple lines with the fruit-specific pg <dig> gene suppressed. the fruit were phenotyped for a range of chemical, ultrastructural and biophysical features to assess changes in the cell wall, cell packing and the mode of tissue failure. the present study provides new evidence for the role of pg <dig> in apple fruit, and presents new opportunities for understanding physiological processes not previously linked with pg.

RESULTS
suppression of pg <dig> leads to firmer apple fruit and reduced pectin depolymerisation
to directly assess the role of pg <dig> in apple fruit ripening, a binary vector containing a construct with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter controlling the transcription of a pg <dig> transgene in the antisense orientation was assembled. ten independent pg <dig> antisense  transgenic apple lines were generated in the cultivar ‘royal gala’ using agrobacterium-mediated transformation
 <cit> . these plants were grown alongside untransformed ‘royal gala’ control lines in a containment greenhouse.

in the first two seasons of fruiting, only some of the pg1as lines produced small numbers of fruit . fruit were harvested when mature and assessed when ripe using a destructive puncture  test in the fruit cortex. one transgenic line, pg1as- <dig>  was identified as having fruit that were consistently firmer when compared with those obtained from untransformed ‘royal gala’ controls and the other transgenic lines .

in season  <dig>  all ten independent pg1as lines produced fruit. relative to controls, no differences in final fruit size or shape were observed . two transgenic lines  were identified that were firmer after ripening than ‘royal gala’ controls . in these two lines, softening was only ~20-30 n compared with ~40-50 n in the control and the other pg1as lines.

for each of the transgenic lines, proteins were extracted from mature fruit at harvest and from fruit following ripening. the extracts were then screened for the presence of immunodetectable pg <dig> protein using protein gel blot analysis with a polyclonal pg <dig> antibody. at harvest, low levels of pg <dig> protein were detected in control fruit and one pg1as line, pg1as- <dig> . after ripening, pg <dig> protein was observed at higher abundance than at harvest in the control and pg1as- <dig> lines. pg <dig> protein was also detected in seven other pg1as lines, but was undetectable in fruit of lines pg1as- <dig> and pg1as- <dig> . these two independent transgenic lines with low pg <dig> protein abundance were also the lines with the firmest fruit after ripening  and were therefore chosen for further detailed study.

in untransformed ‘royal gala’ controls, pg <dig> mrna abundance was strongly induced during ripening . in the transgenic lines, the suppression of pg <dig> protein accumulation was reflected in the abundance of the pg <dig> mrna, with pg1as- <dig> and pg1as- <dig> fruit showing a 75% and 92% reduction in pg <dig> mrna accumulation during ripening, respectively, compared with the control . as an internal ripening control, the expression of a ripening-related apple β-galactosidase gene
 <cit>  was shown to be induced to a similar level in pg1as- <dig>  pg1as- <dig> and control fruit . this result suggested that other aspects of cell wall metabolism related to ripening were proceeding as normal.

in vitro, pgs hydrolyse the homogalacturonan backbone of pectin polymers with a low degree of methylesterification, and hence may play a role in pectin solubilisation and depolymerisation during fruit ripening. to determine whether there was a difference in the pectin components of the cell walls of the two pg1-suppressed lines compared with ‘royal gala’ controls, cell walls were prepared from fruit after ripening then extracted to solubilise pectins. sequential extractions solubilised water-soluble pectin, which is essentially unattached to the cell wall, followed by cdta-soluble pectin, which is held in the wall by calcium bonds and is attributed to pectin of the middle lamellae. relative to controls, suppression of the pg <dig> gene substantially reduced the amount of water-soluble pectin and increased the amount of cdta-soluble pectin . the polyuronide content in the water-soluble extract from the pg1as- <dig> line was less than half that of ‘royal gala’ control fruit, with pg1as- <dig> being intermediate, but also substantially reduced relative to the control. a corresponding increase in the amount of cdta-soluble polyuronides was found in the two pg1-suppressed lines, which possessed a polyuronide content at least 50% greater than the control. these data indicate that in the pg1-suppressed lines pectin is less soluble than in controls, and a greater proportion is retained in the wall by calcium bonds.

analysis of the size distribution of water-soluble polyuronides showed that the relative average molecular mass was similar between pg1as lines and ‘royal gala’ control, with the polyuronides of the two transgenic lines on average being only slightly larger than the control . the cdta-soluble polyuronides from both pg1as- <dig> and pg1as- <dig> were considerably larger than in the ‘royal gala’ control, seen as a substantial shift in the peak average molecular weight to higher molecular mass .

suppression of pg <dig> reduces water loss from ripe fruit and changes the structure of hypodermal cell layers
the rate of water loss in ‘royal gala’ control, pg1as- <dig> and pg1as- <dig> fruit was assessed at 20°c for 9 weeks following low temperature ripening. after 9 weeks, the pg1as- <dig> and pg1as- <dig> fruit showed less shrivelling compared with control fruit . whereas control fruit exhibited a relatively large mean decrease in fresh weight of  <dig> % weight loss per day, the two independent pg1-suppressed lines showed only  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  weight loss per day . this unexpected observation indicated that silencing the pg <dig> gene reduced water loss from the fruit.

to assess whether this difference in water loss was due to changes in cellular structure of the exocarp , light microscopy was conducted on fruit at harvest and following ripening. in the ‘royal gala’ control , toluidine blue staining of sections of the exocarp and outer cortex showed a hypodermal layer of small cells with thickened cell walls 4– <dig> cells deep that extended to a depth of ~50–70 μm into the fruit . the walls of these cells stained densely at harvest. following ripening, the cells of the hypodermal layers in all control samples appeared to be larger and more rounded, and the cell walls  were swollen, increasing the depth of this zone to ~100 μm . in pg1as- <dig> fruit at harvest, the hypodermal layer was similar to the ‘royal gala’ control . however, following ripening the hypodermal layer in all samples of pg1as- <dig> fruit did not appear to undergo the same level of cell swelling, maintaining a more ‘at-harvest’ appearance than the ripened ‘royal gala’ control .

suppression of pg <dig> in the fruit cortex changes intercellular adhesion and alters fracture properties
underneath the hypodermal layers, apple cortical cells are larger and rounder than near the epidermis and there are more visible intercellular spaces . at harvest, the cell walls in this region stained similarly in both the ‘royal gala’ control and pg1as- <dig> fruit. cell walls typically stained evenly, except at the junctions between three cells, or between two cells and an intercellular space where staining was more intense. there was no sign of cell-to-cell separation in either controls or in pg1-suppressed fruit . following ripening, cells in the ‘royal gala’ control showed separation at the corners of attachment between three cells and along the middle lamella . once the corners had separated, two or three remnants of wall material protruded into the intercellular space. in the pg1as- <dig> fruit, neither separation of the corners nor protruding cell wall remnants were observed .

immunolabelling of ripened ‘royal gala’ cortex tissue with the jim <dig> antibody  showed labelling along the cell wall, and strong labelling of the cell wall protrusions . in ripened tissue from the pg1as- <dig> line, labelling was evenly spread over the cell wall and no cell wall protrusions were observed . these changes in cell separation and immunolabelling suggested that there might be a change in intercellular adhesion properties that could be measured using a tensile test  rather than a puncture test .

to test this hypothesis, in season  <dig>  ‘royal gala’ control and pg1as- <dig> fruit were re-assessed using puncture and tensile tests at harvest and following a shorter ripening treatment . at harvest, there were no significant differences in maximum puncture firmness  or maximum tensile force between the ‘royal gala’ control and pg1as- <dig> apples . in contrast, in ripened fruit, maximum puncture firmness and maximum tensile force were both significantly higher in pg1as- <dig> apples compared to the ‘royal gala’ control . force deformation analysis showed that the ripened pgas- <dig> apples had a higher young’s modulus  and higher work  for both puncture and tensile tests when compared to ‘royal gala’ control apples . however these two differences in mechanical properties correlated with fruit firmness, with apples of similar firmness showing the same mechanical properties regardless of the presence of the transgene. different probe sizes were also used to assess the relative contributions of shear  and compression  forces during the puncture test. this approach showed that the compression forces were dominant and closely reflected the maximum firmness values . in contrast, while a more minor component, the shear forces were higher for the pg1as- <dig> apples both at harvest and after ripening . this was the only mechanical feature which was higher in the pg1as- <dig> apples at harvest.

sections of ripened fruit after the tensile strength tests were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and examined on a cold stage scanning electron microscope . the fracture surfaces of the pulled-apart sections of ‘royal gala’ showed areas of undamaged, un-ruptured rounded cells and low juice , whereas sections from pg1as- <dig> showed a relatively large number of damaged  cells and sheet-like layers of juice obscuring cortex cells, indicating more cellular fractures and ruptures, and more free fluid in the cortex tissue .

discussion
historically, apple has been reported to lack detectable depolymerisation of pectin during ripening
 <cit> . here we show that suppression of apple pg <dig> results in a clear increase in the average molecular mass of pectin, particularly in a cdta-soluble fraction. since pg1-suppressed fruit were significantly firmer than control fruit, it appears that the molecular weight distribution of pectin influences the firmness of apple fruit, presumably through increased integrity of the middle lamella. this result is consistent with data concerning the down-regulation of fapg and pectate lyase in transgenic strawberry lines
 <cit> , but not with those regarding down-regulation of slpg in transgenic tomato lines. the reason for this difference may relate partly to the degree of pg down-regulation achieved in tomato, and partly to the system studied. there are large differences in the extent to which depolymerisation naturally occurs in these fruit; pectin depolymerisation in both apple and strawberry is slight, whilst in tomato it is more extensive
 <cit> . tomato possesses unusually high levels of pg activity, and the ~1% of activity remaining in slpg-suppressed fruit was apparently sufficient to cause almost wild-type levels of pectin depolymerisation
 <cit> . based on the transgenic work in strawberry and that presented here, it thus seems likely that pg-mediated pectin depolymerisation provides a component of the softening seen in many ripening fruit.

sensory studies have shown that upon biting and chewing, the primary walls of apple fruit rupture and the cellular juices are released, resulting in juiciness
 <cit> . the link between sensory juiciness and free fluid in pulled-apart sections in apple has been correlated with differences in pectin composition of which the most notable is a reduced galacturonic acid content in the water-soluble pectin fraction
 <cit> . in this study, assessments of tensile properties and shear forces during puncture testing in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy showed that ripening in apple is normally accompanied by decreasing strength of the middle lamellae, resulting in reduced intercellular adhesion and cell separation under stress. in pg1-suppressed tissue, middle lamella strength was retained and the point of failure under stress became the primary cell walls, resulting in cellular rupture and release of free fluid. these higher levels of free fluid and increased tensile strength and shear forces indicate potential for a fruit with a juicier, crisper texture.

an unexpected consequence of pg <dig> suppression that has emerged from this work is a change in hypodermal anatomy that may influence fruit firmness by regulating water status. declining cell turgor is a normal part of fruit softening
 <cit>  and is brought about by a combination of the movement of osmotic solutes and water to the apoplast
 <cit>  and by transpirational water loss from the fruit
 <cit> . in tomato, the lack of softening in the dfd mutant was attributed to very low water loss and increased cellular turgor
 <cit> . the data of figures 
 <dig> and
 <dig> show not only that an increase in transpirational water loss from the fruit is a part of ripening in apple, but that this is at least in part controlled by developmental changes in the hypodermal layers brought about by the action of pg. in control fruit, a swelling of the hypodermal cell layers occurred during ripening, and was correlated with increasing whole-fruit water loss. in the pg1-suppressed lines, cells in the hypodermal layers of the fruit below the cuticle remained densely packed, which was correlated with slower water loss from the fruit and reduced shrivelling. the cuticle and surface cell layers of fruit are known to change both in wax composition and in thickness and structure during ripening
 <cit> . this can include a reduction in the amount of cell wall polysaccharide that is associated with the cuticle
 <cit> . in apple, although the surface conductance declines from an initial high level in developing fruit, the rate of water loss per fruit declines only slightly by the time fruit are ripe
 <cit> . the data presented here suggest that the action of pg may indirectly promote fruit water loss during ripening, in part by reducing intercellular adhesion and allowing a swelling of the hypodermal cell layers .

a relationship between pectin fine structure and tissue anatomy has been shown both in fruit and in other organs. in potato tubers, fragmentation of rhamnogalacturonan i by a fungal rhamnogalaturononan lyase induced radial swelling of the periderm cells and the development of cortical intercellular air spaces
 <cit> . in tomato fruit, down-regulation of the ethylene-regulated auxin response factor dr <dig> reduced pectin solubilisation and altered the distribution of methyl ester side groups, which produced a higher proportion of small cells in the outer pericarp and a thinner cuticle, and fruit firmness was increased
 <cit> . interestingly, over-expression of a fungal pg in tobacco altered cellular arrangement and enhanced fresh weight loss from detached leaves
 <cit> , suggesting that pg may play a wider role in altering intercellular adhesion that can affect cell shape and packing, which in some tissue results in increased water loss.

CONCLUSIONS
by comparing transgenic apple lines that differ only in the expression of a single gene, we show for the first time the effects of pg <dig> action on apple cell wall metabolism during ripening. our data confirm pg1’s role in apple fruit softening and textural change and suggest that this is achieved in part by cell wall disassembly and loss of intercellular adhesion. the unexpected effects of pg <dig> suppression on fruit anatomy and transpirational water loss show that pg1’s function in fruit ripening is more complex than previously reported.
