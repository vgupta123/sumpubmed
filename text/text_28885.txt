BACKGROUND
rna interference  is a biologically important mechanism, and a medically promising method of suppressing gene expression in eukaryotic cells. two main types of interfering rnas  silence genes by complementary interactions with their mrna targets. both micrornas  and small interfering rnas  exhibit strand bias and are incorporated into related rna-induced silencing complexes . the assembly of the risc is a key step in rna interference. enhanced flexibility of mirna precursors at the 5'-antisense terminal base pair was demonstrated, and the same trend was observed in sirnas  <cit> . sirna duplexes are functionally asymmetric: one of the two strands is preferable for incorporation to the risc. tomari and coauthors  <cit>  showed that thermodynamic differences in the base-pairing stabilities of the 5' ends of the two sirna strands determine which strand is assembled into the risc. stability of the base pairs at the 5' ends of the two sirna strands determine the degree to which each strand participates in the rnai pathway  <cit> .

recent studies suggest that sirnas and mirnas are functionally interchangeable, with the choice of mrna translational repression versus mrna cleavage determined solely by the degree of complementarity between small rnas and their targets  <cit> . both sirna strands of the sirna duplex can direct rnai, because each risc contains only one of the two strands of the sirna duplex  <cit> . in a recent study, hu and co-authors  <cit>  evaluated the relative gene-silencing efficiency of a pair of sense and antisense transcripts, derived from the same genetic locus but transcribed in opposite directions. the study demonstrated that sirnas can induce degradation of a sense and an antisense transcripts simultaneously and that the strand-specific activity of sirna can be altered by single-base mismatches  <cit> . previous studies also showed that the thermodynamic profiles of sirnas and mirnas and asymmetry in these profiles play a key role in rnai efficiency  <cit> .

a number of sirna-specific features contributing to the different steps of the rna-mediated gene silencing were identified and several sets of prediction rules were suggested and experimentally validated  <cit> . ui-tei et al.  <cit>  showed, using a set of ~ <dig> sirnas, that highly effective sirnas satisfy the following criteria: a/u at the 5' end and au-richness in the 5' terminal  <dig> bp region of the antisense strand, g/c at the 5' end of the sense strand, and the absence of any long gc stretch of more than  <dig> bp in length. composition features for functional mirnas were studied by krol et al.  <cit> . other authors showed that the secondary structure of mrnas can influence the efficiency of sirnas  <cit> . khvorova et al.  <cit>  and schwarz et al.  <cit>  accented on the thermodynamic features of sirna duplexes. later stockholm's rules were suggested, where a combination of thermodynamic and statistical features was used  <cit> . amarzguioui and prydz  <cit>  found that some features consistently correlated with functionality, these include an asymmetry in the stability of the duplex ends and their nucleotide composition preferences. saetrom and snove  <cit>  compared different prediction methods and rules and showed that the best models gave an overall correlation between predicted and observed efficacy of  <dig>  on sirna . recently, the algorithm biopredsi was used to predict the activities of  <dig> sirnas from the  <dig> sirna set by novartis, targeting  <dig> mrnas . this algorithm was trained on the remaining  <dig>  sirnas  <cit> . however, this training set may have contained sirnas partially overlapping with the test set. according to our calculations, failure to account for test/training overlaps can lead one to substantially overestimate r . our training procedure does not have this problem.

in this study we used a combination of different composition and thermodynamic characteristics in a computational model. we derived the list of parameters, which differ significantly between sets of efficient and inefficient sirnas. we also analyzed common thermodynamic and statistical features in naturally occurring mirnas. functional mirnas have the same trends as efficient sirnas for some of these features. the difference between free energy for terminal dinucleotides at both 5' and 3' ends of sirna antisense strand has the capacity to discriminate between the antisense and sense strands of the duplex, similar to mirnas  <cit> . antisense strands of efficient sirnas are u-rich, especially at the 5' end and resemble the pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides interacting with the polypurine rna tracks recognized by rnase h. these observations together with experimental evidence on the structural similarity between the family of rnase h enzymes and piwi domain of argonaute protein  <cit> , suggest that there is some similarity in interactions of those proteins with nucleic acids. our best neural network model for prediction of efficient sirnas used three parameters and produced a correlation of  <dig>  between predicted and observed efficiencies on the validation set. we also showed that our models are effective for predicting the efficiency of rnai at low and high sirna concentrations. the difference from previous artificial neural network applications and the novelty of our work is that our approach is based on both thermodynamic and composition features. another advantage of our method compared with biopredsi is the small number of parameters. we can use only three parameters rather than  <dig>  so our method requires a much smaller training sets to produce consistent results. our method can be used with smaller sets of experimental data produced under different experimental conditions.

RESULTS
in order to identify features possessing predictive power for efficient sirna design, we analyzed the training set of  <dig> sirnas with experimentally measured activities . we compared commonly used parameters  <cit>  and suggested some new ones. the known parameters we used are nucleotide contents, thermodynamic profiles of sirna duplexes and the free energy difference between the 5' ends of the sense and antisense strands. the last one we optimized using experimental data by schwarz et al.  <cit>  and hu et al.  <cit> . the new parameters are the dinucleotide content indexes, the summarized position-dependent consensus, the frequency of potential targets for sirna in the mrna, and some thermodynamic features dependent on the Δg of inter- and intra-molecular interactions. the new parameters are described in more details in the following subsections. we selected  <dig> parameters that had a significant correlation with sirna silencing activity . table  <dig> lists these parameters and their stability values calculated for four subsets. the values for  <dig> subsets follow essentially the same ordering, and so are omitted.

we calculated distributions of a variety of thermodynamic and composition parameters for the set of efficient and inefficient sirnas . correlations among the selected parameters within the complete set of sirnas are presented in supplementary materials . overall block scheme of the computational steps implemented in this study is presented in supplementary materials .

we performed a similar analysis for human and rodent mirnas, and calculated parameters analogous to the ones we used for efficient sirnas.

below we discuss a number of parameters that are important for efficient sirna design, including the features of the antisense strand of the sirna duplex, the mrna properties and the characteristics of the sirna-mrna interactions that are important for efficient sirna design.

composition features
human mirnas and efficient sirnas both tend to be u-rich. efficient sirnas are depleted in g. significant positive and negative correlations between dinucleotide frequencies and sirna efficacies were identified , which indicated that specific dinucleotide combinations could be helpful for optimal sirna prediction.

we calculated context indexes for preferred and avoided dinucleotides in the subsets of highly efficient and inefficient sirnas. the content index for preferred dinucleotides  is the sum of dinucleotide counts occurring frequently in the antisense strand of sirna efficient duplexes . these dinucleotide counts have a significant negative correlation  with reported activity, and so their presence indicates a more efficient sirna. conversely, the content index for avoided dinucleotides  is the sum of the dinucleotide counts significantly correlated with reported residual target mrna level r >  <dig>  . an example demonstrating how the avoided dinucleotide content index is calculated from sirna sequence is shown in supplementary materials .

frequencies of dinucleotide occurrence for mirnas were compared to random rna controls having the same base distribution, and the t-value that reflected dinucleotide bias was calculated for mirnas. among  <dig> human and  <dig> rodent mirna sequences examined, the frequencies of some dinucleotides were not randomly distributed. similar results were obtained for non-redundant set of mirnas. mirnas have a positive bias for oligonucleotides with alternating gc- and au-content. usually, a/u-containing dinucleotides  alternate with g/c-containing dinucleotides . decreased frequencies of some g/c-containing dinucleotides are observed in both efficient sirnas and mirnas, as compared with the random model. g and u content correlates with sirna efficiencies, but correlation coefficients are somewhat lower than for dinucleotide indexes.

position-dependent consensus
the analysis of a large set of data allowed us to determine position-dependent nucleotide preferences and avoidances for efficient sirnas . oligonucleotide sequences were recorded in a numerical code  and correlation and t-test analyses were performed. we used a t-test to determine which position-nucleotide combinations were significantly  preferred or avoided. table  <dig> presents these significant p-values for one-tailed, two sample, unequal variance t-tests comparing the mean activity for sirnas, which had the given nucleotide in the given position, with the mean activity of the remaining sirnas. the position-dependent nucleotide preferences and avoidances are quantified by the resulting p-values.

we combined these nucleotide biases into a preferred and an avoided position-dependent consensus indexes. the preferred position-dependent consensus index is the number of preferred nucleotides in all positions of the sirna antisense strand. the total number of positions which have significantly preferred nucleotides is  <dig> in our dataset . thus, the preferred consensus index is an integer from  <dig> to  <dig>  the avoided consensus index is defined similarly . the summarized position-dependent consensus is defined as "preferred minus avoided". the total number of positions involved in the summarized position-dependent consensus is  <dig> .

the avoided and preferred position-dependent consensus indexes were calculated from sirna sequence, as shown in supplementary materials .

the distributions of preferred and avoided position-dependent consensuses within the efficient and inefficient sets of sirnas were substantially different . nucleotide preferences are most pronounced at positions 1– <dig>  13– <dig> and 17– <dig> . in positions 1– <dig>  nucleotides u and a are preferable, especially u in the first position. nucleotide g is depleted in all three terminal positions at the 5' end of the antisense strand, and c is also depleted in the first position. frequencies of u are enhanced and frequencies of g are reduced in positions 13– <dig>  positions 17– <dig> are depleted in nucleotide a, at the same time nucleotides c and u are preferred in positions 17– <dig>  and for position  <dig> nucleotides c and g are preferable.

mirnas have the same nucleotide biases at the 5' end of the mature sequence. the frequency of nucleotide u is increased in first positions of mature strands of mirnas, just as in the antisense strand of efficient sirnas. there are strong requirements for elevated au content in the first position and gc-richness at the 3' end of the antisense strand of sirna duplexes.

thermodynamic profile and free energy differences  between 5' and 3' ends of sirna and mirna duplexes
we calculated thermodynamic profiles for sense-antisense duplexes of efficient and inefficient sirnas and for published mirna sequences. the distribution of the matches for potential duplexes in the precursor molecules for mature mirnas of  <dig> nucleotide lengths and the profile of free energy of pre-mirna duplexes are presented in figure 2a. similar results were obtained for mirna precursors of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide lengths . the observed high values of free energy in two regions  can be explained by mismatches in the formation of pre-mirna secondary structures. our data suggest that nucleotides 3– <dig>  6– <dig>  14– <dig> and  <dig> more frequently interact complementarily in mirna precursors. in contrast, position  <dig> and positions from  <dig> to  <dig> frequently are unpaired .

thermodynamic stability profiles for efficient and inefficient sirnas are presented in figure 2b. duplex stability in positions 1– <dig>   <dig>  13– <dig> and  <dig> are different for efficient and inefficient molecules . a significant correlation between free energy of base pairs in these positions and the efficiency of silencing  suggests that these positions can be important for sirna design. efficient sirna duplexes are characterized by less stable interaction at the 5' ends and more stable interaction at the 3' ends of antisense strands, the opposite of inefficient sirna duplexes. overall, thermodynamic stability in efficient sirna duplexes at the 5' end and the 3' end follow the same pattern as in a mature mirna duplex.

our data show that nucleotides 17– <dig> in mature mirnas ought to be more thermodynamically stable than the others and also frequently interact complementarily in mirna precursors. regions 18– <dig> in efficient sirnas have a higher c/g-content and are thermodynamically stable as well. efficient sirnas have the same low stability in the first pair of the antisense strand as mature mirnas . also, the free energy difference between 5' and 3' ends is similar for efficient sirna antisense strands and mature mirnas.

the distributions of calculated free energy differences between 5' and 3' terminal nucleotides in sirna and mirna duplexes are presented in supplementary materials . this difference is an important parameter for efficient sirna prediction. these data are in agreement with experimental evidence that the difference in free energy  can dramatically affect the efficiency of integration of the antisense and sense strands into risc  <cit> . to optimize this parameter, we calculated the Δg difference of duplex formation at the 5' and 3' ends of sirna for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> terminal nucleotides and compared correlation coefficients between these values and sirna efficiencies . we calculated these values for two different experimental data sets measuring integration of the antisense and sense sirna strands into risc  <cit> . in all cases, the difference in sirna end stability for terminal dinucleotide pairs had the highest correlation coefficient with sirna efficiency . this parameter also showed the best discriminating power for prediction of the ratio of antisense versus sense strand incorporation into risc. in our data set, we observed the same pattern.

thermodynamic characteristics of competitive duplex structures
as shown previously, duplex stability is very important for hybridization and antisense oligo-rna interaction  <cit> . it is hypothesized that oligo intra- or intermolecular structures can compete with oligo-target duplex formation which may result in low hybridization efficiency. extensive secondary structure of the target can also limit this efficiency. we addressed the thermodynamics of the relative stability of sirna antisense strand-target duplexes, sirna antisense strand-intra duplexes and inter-molecular self-structures of the antisense strand of sirna, and found that thermodynamic considerations improve the selection of efficient sirna targets in mrnas. the following thermodynamic features are significantly different for efficient and inefficient sirnas and are important for optimal target prediction:  gibbs free energy of sense-antisense duplexes,  free energy of sirna self-structure and free energy of sirna bimolecular interaction,  mrna secondary structure and free energy of sirna antisense strand affinity to mrna targets,  frequency of potential sirna targets in mrna. the correlation coefficients and the results for t-tests are presented in table  <dig> 

the average of duplex free energy for efficient  and inefficient  sirnas are different , and it is significantly lower for efficient sirnas. the distributions of gibbs free energy for the two subsets of sirnas are different, and the distribution for pre-mirna duplexes is closer to the distribution for efficient, than inefficient sirnas .

there is a significant correlation between the silencing efficiency and stability of secondary structures of the antisense strand of functional sirnas . for most of the efficient sirnas, the Δg of self-interaction is close to  <dig>  stability of self-interaction of the mature mirnas is also high and Δg values of self-interaction in mature mirnas are significantly higher than those for randomly shuffled oligos with the same nucleotide content . likewise, there is a correlation between stabilities of both oligo-intra and inter-molecular self-structures .

rnas form stable secondary structures through watson-crick and wobble g-u base pairing. the single-stranded regions are likely to be more accessible for rna-targeting nucleic acids through base pairing interactions than double-stranded structures. we found significant negative correlation between Δg of the local secondary structure of mrna target site and the silencing activity of sirnas .

another parameter important of sirna efficiency is the frequency of potential targets for sirna in the mrna, i.e. mrna sites capable to form stable duplexes with oligoprobes. we estimated the frequency of potential sirna targets in the mrna sequence using thermodynamic parameters  <cit>  and stability threshold of duplex formation of - <dig> kcal/mol, which was determined from the analysis of rnai data. results of this analysis are presented in table  <dig> 

computational models
we calculated stability s <dig> for  <dig> parameters as described in materials and methods, with the results presented in table  <dig>  we chose the tight cluster of parameters with s <dig> ≈  <dig>  as the cut-off for stable parameters. at the same threshold, there is a noticeable drop in r values. the stability values for the best  <dig> parameters are presented in bold in table  <dig> 

out of these  <dig> stable parameters, we identified the set of four stable parameters  possessing the best predictive power on the training set . we used an optimized set of four stable parameters . cross-validation predictions of a  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> network with alpha =  <dig>  and  <dig> epochs of training yielded r <dig> =  <dig> . the corresponding scatter-plot of predicted versus actual values for  <dig> sirnas with a broad range of concentrations is shown in figure 3a. to estimate relative contributions of these parameters to the classifier performance, we measured neural network performance without each of these parameters: summarized position-dependent consensus , avoided dinucleotide content index , Δg difference between 5' ends of sense and antisense strands , and the number of potential target sites in the target mrna . these figures indicate that summarized position-dependent consensus is the most important parameter, which dramatically improves sirna target prediction.

one of the parameters – the frequency of potential targets in the mrna – could not be meaningfully computed on the validation data set. most of the  <dig> training sirnas had their efficiencies evaluated against complete mrna sequences. in contrast, the novartis data set used a short piece of cdna inserted into a plasmid as the target. we chose to avoid complicated approximations for this fourth parameter, and used 3-parameter models on the validation set.

we used a multiple linear regression as our baseline modeling technique. we predicted validation set  efficiencies using the 3-parameter model produced on the training set. the plot of predicted versus actual efficiencies for validation sirnas is shown in figure 3b. we had no reason to expect that a linear model would work best on our data. thus, we also applied neural networks, which would be able to fit any reasonable function.

during training, we experimented with a number of 18-parameter neural network configurations, as described in materials and methods. table  <dig> presents the resulting r <dig> values. r <dig> varied very little with the network layout  for all 1- and 2-hidden layer networks. we then optimized the parameters for the marginal winner  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig>  as described in materials and methods. figure  <dig> presents the optimization landscape. again, there was very little variability for reasonable values of alpha: ±  <dig>  for  <dig>  < alpha <  <dig> . with the  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> network,  <dig> epochs, and alpha =  <dig> , the training set 18-parameter cross-validation r <dig> was  <dig> . the details of the trained neural networks are presented on the ncbi ftp site at .

we found that it is preferable  to use the 3- or 4-parameter  sets in practice. for the validation experiments with  <dig> and  <dig> parameters, we simply borrowed the 18-parameter settings. with  <dig> parameters, the network configuration and parameters had little effect on performance, and so further optimizations would likely not be worthwhile.

we trained a  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> network with alpha =  <dig>  for  <dig> epochs on the  <dig> sirna set, and predicted efficiencies for the sirna validation set. the model's scatter-plot of predicted versus actual values is shown in figure 3c.

for practical purpose one often needs a classification decision – will this sirna be active or inactive? we investigated two thresholds of silencing activity: 20% and 30% residual mrna expression. we computed the roc  curves from the  <dig> sirna validation set output of the linear regression and the neural network model, as described in materials and methods . the areas under the curves are  <dig>   and  <dig>   for linear regression, and  <dig>   and  <dig>   for the neural network. the classifiers from the two models are practically indistinguishable, but in both cases the 20% predictions are a little better.

in practice, it is not essential to find every active sirna, just some active sirna with as few failures as possible. for high-specificity predictions, a suitable point on the 20%-threshold roc graph might be that with  <dig> % specificity and  <dig> % sensitivity. for 30%, one might choose  <dig> % specificity and  <dig> % sensitivity.

it is expected that this set of  <dig> parameters can substantially improve the efficiency of prediction on any dataset. importantly, all of these parameters can be computed efficiently and can be easily used for large scale sirna target prediction at the transcriptome level. thus, it makes possible to offer an in silico prediction of efficient targets for all known mammalian transcripts. we calculated these stable sirna parameters for ~ <dig> human transcripts, and these data are available in supplementary materials. the profile of predicted and actual activities for sliding window of  <dig> bases along a sequence of human cyclophilin b mrna  is presented in figure  <dig>  it is seen, that our prediction corresponds well to experimentally determined sirna activities.

we tested the sets of  <dig> parameters and the four best parameters on an additional set of  <dig> sirnas which we did not include in our sirna database and did not analyze before. the sirnas in this set were tested in experiments at low concentrations . this analysis showed that both the 18-parameter model and the 4-parameter model produced good predictions  for experimental set of data obtained at low sirna concentrations of sirnas.

a note about cross-validation
when working with out  <dig> sirna training data set, we used a non-overlapping cross-validation technique. the goal was to make sure that there were no highly similar sirnas between the test and training data sets. we ran both the linear regression and neural network models using standard 7-fold cross-validation as well. the resulting r <dig> values with our  <dig> parameters were approximately  <dig>  larger:  <dig>  rather than  <dig>  for linear regression, and  <dig>  instead of  <dig>  for neural networks. thus, having partial overlaps between test and training sirnas may lead one to overestimate generalization performance.

discussion
we analyzed a set of sirnas  with known efficiencies from different sources using some novel prediction parameters and published parameters from literature  <cit> . this data set included experiments performed with a broad range of sirna concentrations, substantially biased towards the high end . in contrast, the  <dig> validation set was evaluated entirely at  <dig> nm concentrations. we analyzed  <dig> thermodynamic and composition parameters, which can, to some extent, separate efficient and inefficient sets of sirnas.

dinucleotide content is a better predictor of efficiency than mononucleotide content; this suggests that both nucleotide content and base stacking are important for efficient silencing. content frequencies, especially for preferable dinucleotides, differ in sirnas and mirnas . likely, these differences reflect functional differences between suppression and cleavage mechanisms in rnai. previous attempts to derive position-specific sirna consensus were based on the analysis of nucleotide frequencies in small sets of efficient sirna and yielded controversial results  <cit> . our consensus is based on correlation and t-test analyses of large sirna dataset, accounting for both significantly preferred and avoided nucleotides at all sequence positions. this approach allows quantitative estimation of position-specific nucleotide preferences and avoidances in a large data set of efficient and inefficient sirnas. our data coincided with previously reported data on base preferences  and dinucleotide content  <cit> . efficient sirnas and mirnas share similar sequence features at the 5' end of the antisense strand. comparison of the 3' terminal positions for sirna and mirna sequences is made difficult by the differences in mirna lengths and the lack of a good mirna consensus there. nevertheless, similar trends such as elevated g or g/c content are apparent in this region. an opposite tendency for u/a and c/g nucleotides at the 5' and 3' ends of the antisense strand in efficient sirnas is in agreement with published results on asymmetry of sirna duplexes  <cit> , which is related to sirna efficiency  <cit> .

our data indicate that the antisense strands of efficient sirnas are u-rich, and therefore are likely to interact with polypurine tracks in mrna targets. it was demonstrated that polypurine rna tracks complexed with pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides are recognized by rnase h  <cit> , and the catalytic domain of rnase h resembles a key functional region in the argonaute protein  <cit> . these observations suggest that sirna-mediated mrna cleavage has some similarity to mechanism of rna degradation by rnase h. in contrast, mirnas are g, u-rich. differences in nucleotide composition between sirnas and mirnas may reflect different requirements for mrna cleavage and mrna translational repression.

thermodynamic profiles for efficient and inefficient sirnas  have been discussed earlier  <cit> . it was shown that sirna duplexes are functionally asymmetric and only one strand is preferentially incorporated into the risc  <cit> . the relative and absolute binding energies of the 5' antisense and 5' sense strands determine which strand enters the risc complex. preferential uptake of one strand into risc based on the thermodynamic stability of sirna duplex is an important criterion for design of efficient sirnas. the sirna's thermodynamic properties must be such that the risc prefers the incorporation of the strand that is complementary to the intended target site. different authors calculated sirna internal stability profiles using scanning windows of different length: pentanucleotide  <cit>  tetranucleotide  <cit>  and trinucleotide  <cit> . in our study we optimized the length of the scanning window for assessment of the functional asymmetry between the sense and antisense strands. we found that free energy differences calculated for two terminal dinucleotides of both ends in sirna duplexes according to the nearest neighbor method  <cit>  possessed the best discriminatory power for distinguishing between the antisense and sense strands of sirnas and their ability to integrate into risc. we conclude that thermodynamic profiles and free energy differences between the 5' ends of sense and antisense strands are important for rnai efficiency and, most likely, are crucial for the optimal sirna design. our data are in good agreement with the results for mirna analysis  <cit> , where it was shown that the two terminal nucleotides best distinguish between the mirnas and its complementary strand.

to understand the thermodynamic requirements for duplex unwinding and strand incorporation into risc, we compared the thermodynamic profiles and match-mismatch patterns of interactions in pre-mirna molecules . patterns of duplex stability follow the patterns of nucleotide mismatches in pre-mirnas of different length, the 5' end of the antisense strand and the central bases of the duplex being generally less stable than the 3'end of the same strand . stability profiles for efficient sirnas at the ends of duplexes show the same tendency as for pre-mirnas . we suggest that the positions' tolerance to mismatches in pre-mirna secondary structure is important for duplex unwinding and incorporation into risc. this pattern of mismatches observed in pre-mirnas may be used in the construction of a synthetic hairpin  sirnas to facilitate duplex unwinding and strand assembly into risc.

target recognition is highly sequence specific process. however, not all positions of a sirna contribute equally to target recognition. from the analysis of mirna and efficient sirna thermodynamic profiles and from their content comparison we can infer that the central region of sirna antisense strands is probably important for target recognition or cleavage. this suggestion is in agreement with experimental data that mismatches in the central part of the sirna duplex  prevent target rna cleavage  <cit> . in the case of mirnas, nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> seem to be the most important for translational suppression  <cit> . recent experimental studies show that there are two classes of mirna target sites: 5' dominant sites with sufficient complementarity to the mirna 5' end, and 3' compensatory sites with strong 3' paring and insufficient 5' paring  <cit> .

we believe that the mosaic pattern of stability in sirna duplexes is a compromise between the need for weak interaction in positions important for duplex unwinding and risc incorporation, and the requirement for strong interaction with mrna targets. thus, different thermodynamic properties of specific sirna regions are crucial for efficient silencing. therefore, detailed analysis of thermodynamic profiles is more helpful for sirna design than estimation of total free energy of duplexes formation.

another important issue is the number of potential target sites that possess substantial complementarity to a sirna. the presence of multiple sites in the target mrna can cause a more efficient degradation due to a cooperative effect or an increased probability of the accessible single strand conformation of the target. to address this problem, we introduced a parameter which determines frequencies of potential  targets with substantial complementarity and low free energy of duplex formation between a sirna and the target mrna. on the other hand, substantial complementarity between a sirna and untargeted mrnas can result in off-target repression, which is a major issue in the field of rnai.

our results demonstrate that competing base pairing interactions  affect the efficiency of sirnai, and that the features of the sirnas  themselves are important for the efficient rna interference. the secondary structure of the target rna has been shown to be important for sirna-mrna interaction  <cit> . target accessibility has long been established as an important factor for the potency of antisense oligonucleotides and trans-cleaving ribozymes. selection of mrna target sites and sirna sequences that are free from stable secondary self-structures helps produce better results in sirna design  <cit> . however, calculation of the target secondary structure and accessibility is computationally expensive  and is not practical for large-scale predictions. for the needs of transcriptome-scale rnai projects, we selected the short list of stable parameters that contain no mrna features and produce reliable results on every subsets of our database. these selected parameters were used for sirna target prediction in human transcripts. the difference from previous nn applications and the novelty of our work is that our approach is based on both thermodynamic and composition features. calculations of full position-dependent consensus and dinucleotide content indexes together with thermodynamic differences between 5' ends of the sense and antisense strands of sirna duplexes improve sirna design.

we investigated the ability of neural network models to improve sirna target prediction over traditional linear models. the neural network regression results do not differ substantially from those of the linear regression. our model has few parameters, and none of them are strongly non-linear, which would account for this similarity. correspondingly, the performance of our threshold-based classifier is almost identical for neural networks and linear regression. our classification results have room for improvement. firstly, for a classifier based on regression results, the regression scoring function should be biased to encourage higher accuracy on active sirnas. secondly, at the expense of a more complex training process, a dedicated neural network classifier could be used.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we showed that the properties of the sirnas themselves are important for rna interference. determination of the preferred and avoided position-dependent consensus of the antisense strand of sirna duplexes is an important step in the efficient sirna design. the 5' ends of antisense strands of efficient sirnas are u-rich and possess a content similarity to the pyrimidine-rich dna oligonucleotides interacting with the polypurine rna tracks that are recognized by rnase h. also, the introduction of mismatching bases at certain positions of sirna duplex may be beneficial for duplex unwinding and incorporation of the antisense strand into risc. some of our mrna features, though expensive to compute, can slightly improve our model. analysis of thermodynamic and compositional features of sirnas based on computational models is a promising approach for transcriptome-scale prediction of the target sites for efficient rna interference. transcriptome-wide analysis of optimal mrna target prediction has a clear potential for uncovering previously undetected features in efficient sirnas.
