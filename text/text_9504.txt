BACKGROUND
endophytes are one of the most important parts of plant microbiota. these microbes reside inside the plants in variety of relationship but they do not cause any deleterious effect to them  <cit> . endophytes are ubiquitous in nature and are found in every plant. they coexist inside the plant and are beneficial for better adaptability of the plants in their ecological niche . during this process, endophytes interact with each other and their host plant changing the metabolic ability of the plant. in addition endophytes are known to produce a multitude of secondary metabolites of pharmaceutical importance  <cit> . these metabolites belong to diverse structural classes and show variety of bioactivities including antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, antidiabetic, insecticidal, immunosuppressive, antioxidant etc. . some of the natural products such as cephalosporins, lovastatin, ivermectin, rapamycin, cyclosporine, paclitaxel etc. still find use as immunosuppressant and to control the infectious and parasitic diseases, lipid disorders, cancer and hypertension  <cit> .

increasing incidence of cancer and development of superbug’s due to antibiotic resistance are the major challenges for researchers  <cit> . therefore, search for safer and novel drug based on natural product is of utmost importance. the success can be achieved by selecting the underexplored and/or unexplored biological resources. they are expected to be the producer of new chemical entities. endophytic fungi belonging to unique environment are one of the promising sources of novel and natural drugs  <cit> .


monarda commonly named as horsemint, beebalm or wild bergamot belongs to lamiaceae , the mint family. it is vastly distributed, medicinal, aromatic and ornamental herb which grows annually or perennially  <cit> . usa, canada, and mexico are its origin point but it also occurs in europe and asia  <cit> . in india, it is growing in shivalik hills since  <dig>  it consists of roughly thirty species and is being grown as garden, food and/or medicinal plant  <cit> . it is used as a flavoring agent in drinks, bakery and meat products. its leaves were pulverized and sprinkled on meat to repel insects and to preserve the meat. its decoction is used to cure catarrh, colds, toothaches, headaches, gastric disorders, nausea, menstrual pain, insomnia, to lessen fevers, soothe sore throat and to relieve flatulence. it is topically used for curing skin eruptions and infections. its aroma is used in potpourri. traditionally it has been used to treat variety of respiratory, digestive and skin disorders. its use as febrifuge, diaphoretic, antirheumatic, carminative, sedative, diuretic and stimulant has also been reported  <cit> . the plant also has antiseptic, anti-oxidant and antifungal properties . major component of its essential oil, thymol, is now-a-days used in modern commercial mouthwash formulations  <cit> . recently its essential oil is found to have anticancer property targeting pi3k pathway  <cit> .

the economic importance of m. citriodora l. created an enthusiasm to study the endophytic community associated with this plant and their spatial distribution. they were also explored for antibacterial and anticancer activities. this attempt is novel as endophytes from m. citriodora have not been documented.

methods
collection, identification and authentication of plant material
fully matured m. citriodora plants were collected randomly between march – april,  <dig> from shivalik hills, jammu and kashmir , india. the species was identified by taxonomist via leaf and flower morphology and preserved in the herbarium  and in the farm of iiim as genetic resource.

isolation of endophytes
the endophytic fungi were isolated from m. citriodora as described by strobel and daisy  <cit>  with slight modifications. different tissues  of the disease free plants were carefully excised with a sterile scalpel. in first instance, these tissues were cleaned by thorough washing in running tap water, followed by deionized  water. clean tissue pieces were sterilized in series of solution: 70% ethanol; 1% sodium hypochlorite ; again 70% ethanol for 1 min each. finally they were again rinsed with sterile distilled water two times. after surface sterilization, tissues were dried on blotting sheets and cut into 1 cm square pieces. these sterile small pieces were placed on water and potato dextrose agar  plates containing streptomycin  to inhibit the bacterial growth. at the same time, water used for washing the tissues  was also plated on the pda to confirm the effectiveness of surface sterilization. the plates were incubated at 25 ± 2 °c after wrapping with parafilm and observed daily. the fungal mycelia which started growing from the tissues were subcultured on new pda plates. the obtained endophytic fungal isolates were coded according to their tissue of origin . these endophytes were stored in paraffin oil at 4 °c and were deposited in rn chopra, microbial repository, iiim.

characterization of endophytes
morphology based identification of endophytes
the endophytic fungi were characterized on the basis of the morphology observed during their growth on pda. they were also examined microscopically to determine the structure of hyphae, conidia, conidiophores and their arrangement.

molecular identification
fungal endophytic isolates were finally identified by its based rdna sequencing. genomic dna of the endophytes was extracted from the in vitro grown biomass of endophytes using the protocol described by reader and broda  <cit> . approximately 1 g of dried mycelia was kept in liquid nitrogen and crushed to a fine powder. it was transferred to 10 ml extraction buffer and vortexed thoroughly. the samples were incubated in water bath set at 65 °c for 30 min followed by intermittent mixing. the tubes were centrifuged at 10000 g for 5-10 min followed by extraction with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol . aqueous layer was collected and dna was precipitated with  <dig> – <dig> volume of absolute ethanol in presence of 1/10th volume of sodium acetate . tubes were inverted slowly to mix the contents followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 20 min at 4 °c. consequently, white/transparent pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol followed by air drying. dried pellets were dissolved in 20 μl of water . its sequences containing its1- <dig> s-its <dig> spanning 500-600 bp were amplified with the universal primers its <dig>  and its <dig>   <cit> . pcr reaction was set up in 50 μl containing dna , 1× pcr buffer , each dntp , each primer  and 1u taq dna polymerase . cycling parameters were 5 min at 94 °c followed by 30 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 55 °c for 1 min, 72 °c for 1 min and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °c. the pcr product  was resolved using agarose gel electrophoresis at 100 v. the amplified product was purified using a gel extraction kit  and sequencing reaction was set up in a 10 μl: 40–60 ng of purified pcr product,  <dig>  pmol forward/reverse primer, big dye terminator sequencing mix 8 μl . samples were sequenced on an automated sequencing system . resultant sequences  were submitted to a genbank and were blasted against the nucleotide database using blastn tool of the us national centre for biotechnology information  for final identification of endophytes  <cit> .

phylogenetic evaluation of endophytic fungi
for phylogenetic evaluation, endophytic its dna sequences of present study and downloaded sequences of their nearest neighbors were aligned in alignment explorer of mega <dig> software  <cit>  using clustalw option. trimming and verification of the sequence alignment were carried out using the muscle  algorithm  <cit> . the maximum composite likelihood and neighbor-joining methods were used to compute the evolutionary distances and history respectively  <cit> . the robustness of the tree was assessed by bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replication  <cit> .

fungal diversity evaluation
to evaluate and quantify the endophytic fungal diversity associated with m. citriodora, different indices such as menhinick’s index , camargo’s index  or species richness, fisher’s log series index , simpson’s index , simpson’s diversity index , the shannon diversity index , and margalef’s richness  were calculated . the similarity indices for fungal endophytic assemblages among tested tissues were also evaluated using sorensen’s index , and jaccard’s index using the following equation: ;  respectively, where a means the number of common fungal species found in endophytic populations of two different tissues and b and c mean the number of endophytic fungal species specific to tissues under comparison  <cit> .

bioactivity evaluation
fermentation and extraction
for the extraction of molecules, the endophytic fungal isolates  were cultured on a set of five potato dextrose agar plates for a period of 15 days at 25 ± 2 °c in an incubator . 5 mm mycelial plug of 10-day old culture was used as inoculum. after fifteen days, fungal growth of five petri dishes was homogenized thoroughly with  <dig>  ml of methanol. homogenate was extracted with one volume of methylene chloride  . the extraction process was repeated four times. solvent containing extract was striped off in a rotary evaporator. the stock solutions of extracts  were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide  and were used to evaluate the anticancer and antimicrobial potential.

cytotoxic activity
endophytic extracts were tested for their cytotoxic effects using an mtt assay. it is a colorimetric assay to quantify the cell survival and proliferation. four human cancer cell lines: hct- <dig> , a- <dig> , mcf- <dig> , pc- <dig>  were procured from national centre for cell sciences , pune, india for the present study. the mtt assay was performed as described by pathania et al.  <cit> . cells were cultured in rpmi- <dig> medium with 10% fetal calf serum , and 100u penicillin/100 μg ml− <dig> streptomycin. cells were incubated at 37 °c with 98% humidity and 5% co <dig> environment . the cell density was adjusted to  <dig> cells ml− <dig> of rpmi medium and 200 μl of these cells were plated in a 96-well plate. fungal extracts in different concentrations  were added to these wells and were incubated for 48 h. after 48 h, the medium of the wells was replaced with a medium containing 3-- <dig>  5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  for additional 3 h. subsequently, supernatant was aspirated out and 200 μl dmso was used to dissolve the mtt-formazan crystals. an elisa reader  was used to measure the optical density of  <dig> well plate at 540 nm with 620 nm as reference wavelength. 5-fu, paclitaxel, and adriamycin drugs were used as positive controls while dmso was used as negative control. extracts were also evaluated on normal cell line  in parallel. absorbance of treated versus untreated cells was recorded and percent growth inhibition was calculated. curvefit software was used to calculate ic <dig> value.

antimicrobial activity
the extracts prepared from the endophytes were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. for antimicrobial activity, six test bacteria  and yeast  were purchased from microbial type culture collection .

agar disc-diffusion assay
the endophytic extracts were tested for their antimicrobial and antifungal activity using agar disc-diffusion method  <cit> . we used streptomycin and amphotericin b as positive controls while dmso  was kept as negative control. each of the bacterial strain was grown in nutrient broth at 37 °c with 200 rpm for 16 h in an incubator. cell density of the culture was adjusted to the mcfarland standard turbidity , which is equivalent to  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony forming units  ml− <dig>  <cit> . it was further diluted to give approximately 105 cfu ml− <dig>  for antibacterial assay, mueller hinton agar plates  were spreaded with 100 μl of these cells. stock solutions of fungal extracts and antibiotics were prepared to a conc. of 10 mg ml− <dig> and 1 mg ml− <dig> respectively. fungal extracts  and antibiotics  were applied on sterile discs  in the centre of plates. all plates were incubated overnight at 37 °c. for antifungal activity, yeast extract peptone dextrose agar was used. zone of inhibition  in terms of the diameter of area showing no bacterial growth around the disc was recorded in mm. the assays were repeated thrice and the mean value of three replications was calculated.

tube dilution method
for quantitative antimicrobial and antifungal activity, endophytic extracts were evaluated by tube dilution method  <cit> . different dilutions of fungal extracts  and antibiotics  were prepared from the stock solutions. for each pathogen, 100 μl of 104 cfu ml− <dig> was mixed with 900 μl of each dilution of fungal extracts and antibiotics. three replicates of each sample were processed. appropriate positive, negative and blank controls  were also prepared in triplicate. all tubes were incubated overnight at 37 °c. the lowest inhibitory/ bactericidal concentrations  were recorded. the assays were replicated thrice and the mean values were calculated.

statistical analysis
all the collected parameters were examined with anova and tukeys post hoc analysis using graph pad prism software.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of the endophytic fungi
endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy and symptomless tissues  of m. citriodora to access their diversity, phylogeny and bioactive potential. twenty eight endophytes were isolated. absence of any growth on pda, plated with water obtained from last rinse of tissues suggests that efficient surface sterilization has been performed. endophytes were identified by their colony morphology and microscopic examination . further their molecular identification was carried out by its based rdna sequence analysis. details of the fungal endophytes, their isolation source, genbank accession numbers, and closest sequence homolog are given in table  <dig> table  <dig> summary of the fungal endophytes isolated from various tissues of m. citriodora

bioactivity evaluation
anticancer activity
anticancer activities of the endophytic extracts at the 100 μg ml− <dig> concentration were found against four human cell lines  while they didn’t inhibit the growth of normal cells . nearly 72% of the extracts showed cytotoxic activity against one or the other human cancer cell line with percent growth inhibition ranging from 51–100%. in the present study, sensitivity of cell lines against tested extracts was in the following order: pc-3 > mcf-7 > hct-116 > a- <dig> cell lines. thirty nine percent of the extracts showed >50% growth inhibition on all the tested human cancer cell lines.table  <dig> anticancer activity of the extracts  prepared from endophytic fungi isolated from m. citriodora

discussion
aromatic and medicinal plants, producers of ethano-pharmacologically important secondary metabolites and essential oils being used in food preservation and in reducing the dose of antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections are the legitimate targets to isolate the endophytic fungi. these fungi are utilized in management of plant diseases. this is the first report on the diversity, phylogeny and bioactive potential of endophytic fungi associated with m. citriodora, an aromatic and medicinal plant. all the fungal endophytes recovered in the present study represented the phylum ascomycota, which is one of the most diverse and ubiquitous phyla of eukaryotes covering approximately 8% of the earth’s landmasses  <cit> . the most prevalent class of fungi was sordariomycetes followed by eurotiomycetes and dothideomycetes. the endophytes of m. citriodora were compared with the endophytes of ocimum sanctum because they both belong to same family and both are aromatic plants. endophytes associated with ocimum sanctum, showed the same representation of classes except saccharomycetes  <cit> . the difference in the endophytic communities between the m. citriodora and ocimum sanctum might be because of host specificity as well as their interactions with different ecological niches.

further, variation was also observed in the spatial distribution of endophytic community of the m. citriodora suggesting that distinct micro-environments of tissues are responsible for shaping their micro-biota differently. thus, tissue specificity was evident among the endophytes of the m. citriodora. leaves supported the wider diversity of endophytes followed by flowers and roots. this might be because of greater surface area of leaves exposed to outer environment. these results well corroborate with the previous studies of endophytic fungi isolation on various indian medicinal plants  <cit> .

in present study, dark septate fungi such as curvularia aeria and alternaria alternata were isolated from leaves contrary to their common habitat i.e. root tissue  <cit> .

for searching the safer and novel drug based on natural product, endophytic extracts were screened for cytotoxic and antibacterial activity. nearly 72% of the extracts showed cytotoxic activity against one of the tested cell lines while 39% of the extracts were active against all the tested cell lines with >50% growth inhibition. ic50 < 20 μg ml− <dig>  was shown by 25% of extracts  <cit> . in comparison, carvalho et al.  <cit>  have reported that three out of sixteen endophytic extracts isolated from the plant stryphnodindron adstringens  coville , had ic <dig> 20 μg ml− <dig> against mcf- <dig> cell line, whereas zhao et al.  <cit>  ascertained the cytotoxicity of the extract of endophyte hypocrea lixii r <dig>  against pc- <dig> cell line. this was found to be less cytotoxic than four extracts  used in the present study against the same cell line.

overall mc-8 l , mc-14 l , mc-18 l , mc-24 l , mc-25 l , mc-14 f , mc-26 f  extracts were found most promising in terms of cytotoxic activity  against different human cancer cell lines.

the cytotoxic molecules beauvericin  and bikaverin  were isolated from an endophytic fusarium oxysporum  <cit> . till now approximately more than  <dig> compounds have been isolated from fusarium genera. out of which,  <dig> compounds have cytotoxic activity. on the basis of natural product dictionary records, only one cytotoxic molecule is known from fusarium oxysporum while no cytotoxic molecule is reported from cladosporium tenuissimum. thus there is lot of scope of isolating new cytotoxic compounds from these endophytes [mc-14 l , mc-24 l .

the antimicrobial potential of the endophytes isolated from m. citriodora was investigated against human pathogens by agar disc-diffusion and tube dilution methods. about 75% extracts showed antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogens with a zone of inhibition  ranging from 6-35 mm which is a higher percentage in comparison to  <dig> % active endophytic bacterial extracts isolated from aloe vera with the zi 6–12 mm  <cit> . this indicates that endophytes from m. citriodora have better antimicrobial potential than endophytic bacteria from aloe vera. in present study, 50% and 25%, extracts showed antimicrobial activity against s. aureus and e. coli respectively. this is in contrast to guimaraes et al.  <cit>  who screened  <dig> endophytic fungal extracts and found that  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 64% extracts to be active against s. aureus, e. coli and c. albicans respectively. hazalin et al.  <cit>  screened  <dig> endophytic extracts against human pathogens. out of which only 8% extracts were active. wiyakrutta et al.  <cit>  also screened  <dig> endophytic extracts against mycobacterium tuberculosis and found  <dig>  extracts to be active. the highest number of active extracts  against s. aureus in the present study indicates that endophytic fungi isolated from m. citriodora might be used to produce potent antimicrobial compounds.

the antimicrobial potential of the endophytic extracts was evaluated by tube dilution method. only eight extracts  displayed antimicrobial activity against the tested human pathogens with an mic value ranging from 10–100 μg ml− <dig>  on comparing the two methods, it was found that upon using agar disc-diffusion, twenty one extracts were found to be active, whereas by using tube dilution method only eight extracts were found to be active with mic value ≤100 μg ml− <dig>  extract of mc-14 l , which displayed zi between 11–15 mm, showed better antimicrobial activity with an mic/mbc value  <dig> –25 μg ml− <dig> against all the tested pathogens, whereas mc-18 l , which displayed better zi , showed little bit lower mic value . results suggest that difference in antimicrobial potency may be because a more diffusible but less active extract may give a bigger zone of inhibition than a non-diffusible but more active extract.

in present study, extracts inhibited the human pathogens with an mic value of  <dig>  μg ml− <dig> whereas in another study crude extracts of endophytes papulaspora immersa and arthrinium arundinis isolated from smallanthus sonchifolius inhibited the human pathogens with an mic value of 90–280 μg ml− <dig>  <cit> . akinsanya et al.  <cit>  reported that the mic and mbc values of the endophytic bacterial extracts isolated from aloe vera range from  <dig>  to 20 mg ml− <dig> against some of the bacterial indicators, which is quite low when compared to the present study. in another study, two endophytic extracts were found to be active against microsporum gypseum with an mic <  <dig>  μg ml− <dig>  <cit> .

present study along with previous studies have indicated that fusarium spp. are the most dominant species among endophytes producing bioactive compounds such as pentaketide , beauvericin, subglutinol a and b . these molecules were found active against c. albicans, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the fusarium spp. were isolated from selaginella pallescens, cinnamomum kanehirae, tripterygium wilfordii plants respectively .

in terms of antimicrobial activities extracts of mc-14 l , mc-18 l , mc-24 l  and mc-14 f  were found promising. only three antibacterial and  <dig> antifungal molecules are known from fusarium oxysporum while no antibacterial and antifungal molecule is known from cladosporium tenuissimum. thus these endophytes [mc-14 l , mc-24 l  could be a source of new antimicrobial compounds.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is the first report of diversity of fungal endophytes isolated from m. citriodora. these results indicated that m. citriodora harbors a rich fungal endophytic community with anticancer and antimicrobial activities. extracts of mc-14 l  and mc-24 l  were found to have potent cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties thus could be a source of novel cytotoxic/antimicrobial compounds highlighting their potential use in the development of drugs , but needs to be further investigated at molecular and mechanistic level.
