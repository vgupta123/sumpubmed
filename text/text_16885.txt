BACKGROUND
environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals is a public health concern. medical substances may roughly be divided into medical substances used by human or veterinary medicine. the veterinary drugs may further be subdivided into substances used as growth promoters for livestock production, therapeutics in livestock productions, coccidiostatic used for poultry production, therapeutics for treatment of livestock on fields or as feed additives in fish farms.

drugs administered to humans and animals are excreted with urine or faeces  <cit>  and attend the sewage treatment plant  <cit> ; successively if substances are hydrophilic or are metabolized to a more hydrophilic form of the parent lipophilic substance, will pass the waste water treatment plant and end up in the receiving waters where they may be are present at very low concentrations; it is important noted that several substances could stimulate a response in humans and animals also at low doses with a very specific target  <cit> . a recent study showed that a mixture of drugs at the concentrations actually found in the aquatic environment of some italian areas is able to exert toxic effects on the proliferation of human and zebra fish  cells cultures  <cit> . the main consequences of use and abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that represent a public health problem, with obvious consequences in human and veterinary medicine, since it affects animal therapy and food safety  <cit> . world wide there is growing concern about the increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance: the growing alarm related to the spreading of the resistance of antibiotics considered of first choice in the treatment of specific human infections prompted measures for antimicrobial resistance surveillance of bacteria circulating in humans, animals and food products. aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial substances and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from wild caught seawater fish and fishery products caught in tyrrenian sea along the coast of campania region . the antibiotics tested were teicoplanin , cephalexin , penicillin , oxacillin , amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , cefotaxime , vancomycin , sulfamethoxazole , rifampicin , cefoxitin , plaritromicin , ciprofloxacin , chloramphenicol , tobramicin , tetracycline , tigecycline , linezolid  and fosfomycin .

RESULTS
microbial analysis and antibiogram
the microbial species isolated were vibrio alginolyticus , vibrio parahaemolyticus , shewanella putrefaciens  and acromonas spp.  ; vp is a bacteria naturally present in marine and estuarine aquatic environments and is part of the natural flora of fish and bivalve mollusks. va, isolated from sepia officinalis and trachurus trachurus samples, is frequently detected from fin fish, shellfish, seawater, and sediment  <cit> . it has not been not widely recognized as a fish pathogen. sp a microorganism common in marine environments as saprophytic is one of the major causes of spoilage of fish and fishery products  <cit> ; water bacteria might be indigenous to aquatic environments, or exogenous, transiently and occasionally present in the water as a result of shedding from animal, vegetal, or soil surfaces  <cit> .

other generes
different microbial species were isolated: vibrio parahaemolyticus  was isolated in sepia officinalis, trachurus trachurus, scorpaena scrofa and diplodus sargus; vibrio alginolyticus  was isolated in all samples except in gobius cobitis and thais haemastoma; shewanella putrefaciens  was isolated in cuttlefish, scorpaena scrofa, octopus vulgaris, gobius cobitis and thais haemastoma; acromonas spp.  was isolated only in scorpaena scrofa.

the frequency of antibiotic resistance among microbial strains isolated was shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  although only  <dig> species of fish and  <dig> species of fishery products were studied to determine the incidence of antibiotic resistance, all the strains isolated were resistant to one or more of the antibiotics tested; the frequency of resistance varied from  <dig> % to 50% in different samples;  <dig> % of the microbial strains isolates showed resistance to more than  <dig> molecules tested. va showed antimicrobial resistance against  <dig> antibiotics, vp against  <dig> antibiotics, sp against  <dig> antibiotics and ac against  <dig> antibiotics tested. accordinto to martinez  <cit> , more than 90% of bacterial strains originated in seawater are resistant to more than one antibiotic. multiple antibiotic resistance has been reported in a wide range of human pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria such as campylobacter spp.  <cit> , klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> , salmonella sp. <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> , e. coli <cit>  and also in fish pathogens  <cit> . in all bacterial strains resistance against tec and va, drugs belonging to the class of glycopeptides having similar mechanisms of action on bacterial cell wall synthesis, and against p and ox, drugs belonging to the class of β-lactam antibiotics, was observed. spectra of activity of tec and va are limited to gram–positive bacteria including methicillin–resistant strains of s. aureus and s. epidermidis and for this reason the resistant gram–negative bacteria isolates could be not sensitive to mechanism of action of these molecules. va has a shorter half–life than tec and requires multiple dosing to maintain adequate serum levels. in contrast, the pharmacokinetics of tec allow for once–daily dosing and it is a drug associated with a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. for these reasons tec is more cost–effective and its role in hospitals is likely to increase. resistance to va could be related not only to the use of va in human medicine but also to a cross-resistance due to the use of avoparcin, a glycopeptides utilized to improve performance in poultry flocks  <cit> , which are present in the area near to sampling zone. resistance against p and ox could be related to the large use of β-lactam antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. the sensitivity against c detected in all bacterial strains coupled with the absence of c residues in fish sampled, confirm the limited administration to humans and the compliance on the use of the drug for food producing animals, banned since  <dig>  however, according kerry et al.  <cit> , it is important to underline that resistance phenomena are not systematically correlated with the presence of the corresponding drugs.

the study of antibiotic resistance in indigenous water organisms is important, as it might indicate the extent of alteration of water ecosystems by human action. the spread of strains with antibiotic resistance from animal to animal does not meet the minimum barrier in the marine environment and resistance evolves as a consequence of promiscuous exchange and shuffling of genes, genetic platforms, and genetic vectors. several pollutants in seawater might exert selective activities, as well as ecological damage in water environment, resulting in antibiotic resistance: baquero et al.  <cit>  noted that resistance profiles of aquatic pseudomonads depend on the species composition, but also from the site in which they were isolated, being more antibiotic-resistant along shorelines and in sheltered bays than in the open water, indicating the influence of nonaquatic organisms or pollutants.

detection of residues of antibiotics
residues of antibacterial substances were detected in common octopus, european cuttlefish and red-mouthed rock shell. at the confirmatory analysis only two of the examined drugs were detected. oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole were quantified with  <dig>  μg/kg and  <dig>  μg/kg respectively. levels detected were in compliance with lmr established by ue reg. 37/ <dig>  the presence of antibiotics might be due to the increased possibility of accumulation in fishery products that, for a period of their life cycle, remain for a long time in the same fishing area. in our study, the sampling area is within a stretch of coastline that spans the mouth of one river and several streams that cross a lot of livestock and agricultural fields.

studies on residues of pharmacologically active molecules have shown elimination rates in the aquatic environment after the depuration treatment generally between  <dig> and 90%, for a wide variety of polar drugs  <cit> . the elimination of drugs in common sewage treatment plants is often incomplete and recent works demonstrates the presence of antimicrobial residues in river waters  <cit> . polar antibiotics cannot be eliminated effectively as much of the process of elimination is based on absorption on activated sludge and so ultimately on hydrophobic interactions. another route of elimination of drugs in the aquatic waste water is connected to the dispersion of manure "contaminated" on the fields as fertilizer through runoff into streams of wastewater and those used for irrigation. it was showed that sulfa drugs, such as sulfadimethoxine, are sufficiently stable in the manure as to maintain a significant residual activity up when the manure is used for fertilizing  <cit>  and that some of the metabolites of antibiotics excreted may also be retransformed into the active drug progenitor; such as the glucuronide dicloramphenicol or the n-4-acetyl sulfamethazine converted into the manure in chloramphenicol and sulfamethazine respectively  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the risk of antibiotic resistance was considered significantly more serious than the risk associated with the presence of antibiotic residues in food  <cit> . results presented in this study provide evidence that seawater fishes collected in some area of campania region, especially in marine areas including mouths of streams, were contaminated by residues of antibiotic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains and that they might play an important role in the spread of antibiotic-resistance. the resistance of  <dig> % of isolated strains against tec might suggest that the main sources of contamination were hospital discharges.

future prediction and prevention of antibiotic resistance depends on the research investments in the development of microbial source tracking as well as in the ecology, including water ecology, of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
