BACKGROUND
nocardia represent a genus of aerobic actinomycetes and belong specifically to the family mycobacteriaceae  <cit> . nocardia are aerobic, gram-positive, filamentous, branching rods and can be found as ubiquitous environmental saprophytes in soil, dust, organic matter and water. due to recent advances in phenotypic and molecular characterization  the spectrum of nocardia has expanded, with more than  <dig> species described  <cit> . at least  <dig> nocardia species have been implicated in human infection with varying geographic prevalence throughout the world  <cit> .

human infections usually arise from inhalation or direct inoculation into skin or soft tissue structures. major forms of nocardia infection are pulmonary nocardiosis, disseminated and cns nocardiosis, cutaneous/lymphocutaneous nocardiosis and mycetoma. nocardiosis may be considered as opportunistic infection with chronic lung disease , transplantation, malignancies, diabetes mellitus and alcohol abuse as most prevalent underlying conditions  <cit> . nevertheless, a review of more than  <dig> cases of nocardia infection revealed no identifiable predisposing immunocompromising factors in approximately 30% of patients  <cit> . additionally, nocardia are well-recognized pathogens in animals with bovine masititis representing the most important infection.

the characteristic histopathological feature of nocardiosis consisting of an acute pyogenic inflammatory reaction i.e. a predominant neutrophil-rich infiltrate as well as results of prior studies point towards an important role of innate defense mechanism against nocardia species.

antimicrobial peptides  represent evolutionarily conserved multifunctional molecules of innate immunity. in mammals, amps like human β-defensins  1- <dig> and bovine lingual or tracheal antimicrobial peptide  are expressed by cells within the epithelial lining or are delivered to sites of infection by circulating leukocytes  <cit> . examples of the latter group of amps include human neutrophil peptides  1- <dig>  bovine indolicidin or human cathelicidin ll- <dig>  <cit> . amps are produced constitutively or are induced upon infection or inflammation and exert activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, enveloped viruses, protozoa and fungi  <cit> . apart from a direct microbicidal effect, amps exhibit a variety of additional functions by promoting chemotaxis and phagocytosis, stimulating angiogenesis and wound healing or neutralizing lps effects  <cit> .

there is increasing evidence that amps take part in innate defense against nocardia-related bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit>  or actinomyces israelii and naeslundii  <cit> . the aim of the current study was to elucidate the contribution of amps in innate immunity against different nocardia species. we therefore investigated the activity of several important epithelial- and neutrophil-derived human and bovine amps against the four nocardial species n. farcinica, n. nova, n. asteroides and n. brasiliensis, all of whichrepresent major human and bovine pathogens.

RESULTS
levofloxacin was used as killing control to compare antinocardial potency of tested amps and showed dose-dependent activity against all four nocardial strains. the peptide dpy without antimicrobial activity served as negative control and exhibited no activity against all tested nocardia strains .

activity of human amps against nocardia species
all tested human amps exhibited activity against n. farcinica atcc  <dig>  and n. nova atcc  <dig> . human β-defensin hbd- <dig> revealed strongest activity with ld <dig> of  <dig> μg/ml against both strains. human cathelicidin ll- <dig> showed ld <dig> of  <dig> μg/ml respectively. accordingly, we found human α-defensins hnp 1- <dig> to be active, although higher concentrations were needed with ld <dig> > <dig> μg/ml against n. farcinica and ld <dig> of  <dig> μg/ml against n. nova . notably, hbd- <dig> and ll- <dig> were found to be more potent against n. nova than levofloxacin in equivalent concentrations.

ld <dig> denotes the lowest peptide concentration leading to a = 90% reduction of cfu after incubation  with amps or levofloxacin. presented data are ld <dig> determinations based on means of at least four  or two  independent sets of experiments with each nocardia species. in brackets are means  ± standard deviation of respective experiments.

sd standard deviation, n.d. not determined

to address additive or synergistic effects of amps, we performed a model assay using n. farcinica and a combination of ll- <dig> and hnp 1- <dig> . since the combination of the two amps exhibited nocardial killing comparable to each peptide alone at twofold higher concentrations, we found additive activity of the two amps.

in contrast to results with n. farcinica and n. nova, hbd- <dig> and ll- <dig> did not show antinocardial activity against n. asteroides atcc  <dig> . only human α-defensins hnp 1- <dig> were found to be active against n. asteroides with ld <dig> of  <dig> μg/ml.

n. brasiliensis atcc  <dig> proved to be resistant to all human amps tested since neither hnp 1- <dig> nor hbd- <dig> or ll- <dig> exhibited killing activity in concentrations up to  <dig> μg/ml . remarkably, stronger growth of n. brasiliensis was observed with all three amps investigated. enhanced growth was not found after incubation with equivalent concentrations of dpy . to investigate whether proteolytic degradation of amps by n. brasiliensis-derived proteases might play a role, we added a protease inhibitor mix during incubation in cfu assays. protease inhibitors were not able to alter the observed amp resistance of n. brasiliensis, yet enhanced growth of n. brasiliensis after co-incubation with protease inhibitors could be observed again.

activity of bovine amps against nocardia species
cfu-assays revealed activity of all tested bovine amps against n. farcinica atcc  <dig> . neutrophil-derived indolicidin and bovine β-defensin lap showed potent killing with ld <dig> of  <dig> μg/ml respectively. bovine tap was also active, ld <dig> proved to be  <dig> μg/ml. all bovine amps revealed at least comparable or greater activity at  <dig> μg/ml against n. farcinica than levofloxacin. accordingly, bovine indolicidin exhibited killing activity against n. nova  and n. asteroides  .

in contrast to human amps, bovine indolicidin exhibited activity against n. brasiliensis atcc  <dig>  thus, representing the sole amp capable to kill n. brasiliensis . ld <dig> of indolicidin was  <dig> μg/ml. according to results of hbd- <dig>  n. brasiliensis proved to be resistant to bovine β-defensins lap and tap. again, pronounced growth was observed after incubation with both amps .

amps are effector molecules of innate immunity and provide a first line of defense against invading pathogens. our investigations reveal a differential activity of epithelial- and neutrophil-derived amps against four members of the genus nocardia. whereas n. farcinica and n. nova were found to be susceptible to all investigated human and bovine amps, n. asteroides was killed exclusively by human α-defensins hnp 1- <dig> and bovine indolicidin.

host-pathogen interactions in nocardia species have been extensively studied   <cit> . severity and manifestations of nocardiosis are influenced by the portal of entry, tissue tropism, inoculum dose and virulence characteristics of the infecting nocardia strain and, conversely, the efficacy/virtue of the mounted host immune response. innate defense mechanisms, specifically killing and elimination by neutrophils and macrophages appear to be of particular importance for the outcome of nocardiosis. although insufficient to resolve infection, the early phagocyte attack is considered to retard infection until lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and activated macrophages accomplish a definite response  <cit> .

constituting a major part of the microbicidal mechanisms of neutrophils, we propose amps to contribute to the early phase of defense against various nocardia species. interestingly and in favour of our hypothesis, we found neutrophil-derived amps such as human hnp 1- <dig> and bovine indolicidin to have broader antinocardial activity than the investigated epithelial amp hbd- <dig> . moreover, besides their abundant presence in neutrophils, amps are produced by other innate defense effector cells. ll- <dig> and, to a lesser extent, hnp 1- <dig> were found in monocytes/macrophages, nk cells and γδ t cells  <cit> , which are also considered to take part in antinocardial defense.

several virulence determinants of nocardia including lysozyme resistance and inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion have been described  <cit> . due to prior investigations, host-pathogen interactions are best charaterized in n. asteroides infection. a distinct feature of virulent strains of n. asteroides is the capability to resist to oxidative burst-mediated killing by phagocytes due to catalase  <cit>  and superoxide dismutase production  <cit> . here we found hnp 1- <dig> and indolicidin to represent nocardicidal effector molecules belonging to the armament of non-oxidative killing mechanisms of neutrophils. in accordance with our observations, filice et al. found neutrophil granule-derived cationic proteins  to inhibit n. asteroides growth and filament formation  <cit> .

in human neutrophils, α-defensins hnp 1- <dig> are stored as active peptides in primary  granules in concentrations of > <dig> mg/ml  <cit> . as granule-contents are minimally diluted after fusion with the phagocytic vacuole, hnp 1- <dig> targets ingested pathogens in concentrations multitudes higher than those needed for potent antinocardial killing observed in our study . in contrast, the human cathelicidin is stored as inactive precursor hcap- <dig> in secondary  granules and is processed to ll- <dig> by proteinase  <dig> after secretion into the extracellular milieu. like the human β-defensin hbd- <dig>  ll- <dig> is additionally produced upon infection or inflammation by epithelial cells of the respiratory/gastrointestinal tract or by keratinocytes. levels of ll- <dig> e.g. in airway surface fluids are estimated to be 1- <dig> μg/ml  <cit> . concentrations of β-defensins are estimated to be in the range of 1- <dig> μg/ml  <cit> . thus, in vivo concentrations of ll- <dig> and hbd- <dig> will most likely be not sufficient to exert direct nocardial killing. nevertheless, ll- <dig> and hbd- <dig> may take part in antinocardial defense by additive or synergistic action with other antimicrobial peptides and proteins abundantly present along epithelial barriers. in favour of this hypothesis, we found additive killing of n. farcinica in a model assay using a combination of ll- <dig> and hnp 1- <dig>  moreover, owing to a wide range of biological activities, ll- <dig> and hbd- <dig> may further contribute due to chemotactic effects on neutrophils, monocytes and t cells  <cit> .

we found n. brasiliensis to exhibit complete resistance to all investigated human amps and to be susceptible only to bovine indolicidin. n. brasiliensis is the most frequently reported cause of progressive cutaneous and lymphocutaneous disease. furthermore, n. brasiliensis often causes infection in otherwise immunocompetent hosts. these clinical features are in accordance with our findings, demonstrating a complete resistance of n. brasiliensis against human epithelial, i.e. keratinocyte-derived and neutrophil-derived amps.

n. brasiliensis is known to produce a variety of proteases  <cit> . to evaluate a potential resistance due to proteolytic degradation of amps , cfu-assays were conducted in the presence of protease inhibitors. however, protease inhibitors did not alter amp-resistance in n. brasiliensis. one might speculate about species-specific variances in bacterial cell wall constituents yielding to differential nocardial amp susceptibility/resistance  <cit> . additionally, other mechanisms, i.e. active efflux by multi-drug transporters or modifications on the bacterial cell surface may confer amp resistance.

the current study revealed n. brasiliensis to be susceptible only to indolicidin, a tryptophan- and proline-rich  <dig> amino acid peptide of bovine neutrophils. in contrast to the predominantly membrane-active human defensins and cathelicidin ll- <dig>  indolicidin has been referred to exert intracellular modes of action with inhibition of dna and protein-synthesis and alteration of cytoplasmic membrane septum formation  <cit> . thus, its distinct chemical features and alternative mode of action may contribute to the unique activity of indolicidin against n. brasiliensis.

CONCLUSIONS
selected amps are capable to contribute to the first line of defense against nocardia, yet, susceptibility appears to vary across different nocardia species. interestingly, our finding of neutrophil-derived amps to possess a broad antinocardial spectrum is paralleled by the characteristic feature of a neutrophil-rich infiltrate in histopathological specimens of nocardiosis. moreover, the observed resistance of n. brasiliensis is remarkable, since n. brasiliensis is frequently reported to cause cutaneous and lymphocutaneous disease in otherwise immunocompetent hosts. further studies should address in more detail the differential activity of amps, its causes and pathophysiologic significance.
