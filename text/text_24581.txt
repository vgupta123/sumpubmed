BACKGROUND
posttranslational protein modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins  serves as a versatile mechanism to control multiple biological functions in the cell  <cit> . the ifn-stimulated gene  <dig>  is a ubl strongly induced by type i ifn and isg <dig> conjugation  is one of the major antiviral effector systems  <cit> . consequently, mice lacking isg <dig> exhibit enhanced susceptibility upon distinct viral pathogens. analogous to the ubiquitin modification process, conjugation of isg <dig> is mediated by a cascade of e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> ligases and isg <dig> linkage is counteracted by the activity of deconjugating enzymes  <cit> . usp <dig>  was shown to be the major isg <dig> deconjugating enzyme and belongs to the peptidase c <dig> family  <cit> . as usp <dig> deficient mice and cells show elevated levels of isg15- conjugated substrates  <cit> , it appears feasible to enhance isgylation levels by inhibition of the usp <dig> protease activity. this might also be of therapeutic interest as usp <dig> deficient animals were shown to be more resistant against certain viruses  <cit>  and exhibit resistance against pml-rar-  <cit>  and bcr-abl-induced leukemia  <cit> . a prerequisite for the identification of chemical compounds suitable to inhibit usp <dig> is the availability of a fast and sensitive enzymatic assay monitoring isg <dig> deconjugation. high through-put screening based on ubiquitin-amc  has been used with success for the identification of small molecules inhibiting usp protease activity.  <cit> . the assay is based on the release of the fluorophore amc upon cleavage of the isopeptide bond by the usp. thus, presumably isg <dig> deconjugase inhibitors could be identified using isg15-amc in a similar protease inhibitor assay. however, in the case of usp <dig> the setup of such an assay for high-throughput screening was hampered so far by limited amounts of recombinant enzymatically active usp <dig>  attempts to express usp <dig> in escherichia coli  resulted in degraded protein  <cit> . expression in sf <dig> cells using the baculovirus expression systems was successful but is difficult to scale up and cost intensive  <cit>  compared to bacterial expression systems. here we report the development of a bacterial expression system based on the fusion of usp <dig> to a bacterial chaperone  that yields high amounts of enzymatically active protein. usp <dig> was purified to homogeneity as a tf-fusion protein. the recombinant protease is specific for isg <dig> as shown by enzymatic deconjugation of isg <dig> from isgylated cellular proteins and by the formation of a covalent adduct with isg <dig> vinyl sulfone. finally, we established assay conditions for usp <dig> mediated isg15-amc cleavage suited for the setup of large scale inhibitor screens.

methods
cloning methods
the consensus sequence for ubiqutinyl hydrolases encompasses residues 46– <dig> of usp <dig>  the  <dig> n-terminal residues are of unknown function. cdna encoding residues 46– <dig> of mouse usp <dig> in frame with a his6-tag and the recognition site for the  <dig> c protease was amplified and cloned into pet15b  and pgemex  vector. all cloning steps were performed according to standard protocols  <cit> .

for usp <dig> constructs with codons optimized for expression in e. coli a synthetic cdna encoding usp <dig> residues 46– <dig>  as well as a  <dig> c protease recognition site and a flexible linker at the 5’ end was purchased from a commercial supplier . cdnas for his6-sumo and his6-sumo-tfaaa were generated by pcr using vector psumo-tigaaa <cit>  as template. the cdnas were fused and cloned into the vector pace by sequence and ligation independent cloning   <cit>  yielding vectors pace-his6-sumo-tfaaa-usp <dig> and pace-his6-sumo-usp <dig>  ndei and xhoi restriction sites were inserted to allow further subcloning of the constructs.

the following primers were used for vector and insert amplification and ligation: xhoi-pace-for: 5’-ctcgagagatccggctgctaacaaag-3’, ndei-pace-rev: 5’-catatgtatatctccttcttaaagttaaac-3’, xhoi-usp18-rev: 5’-ctttgttagcagccggatctctcgagttaggagccggttttcg-3’,   sumo-3c-for:  5’-cacagagaacagattggtggtctggaagttctgttccagggtccg-3’,  tf-for: 5’-cactttcaacgagctgatgaaccagcaggc-3’, tf-rev: 5’-gcctgctggttcatcagctcgttgaaagtg-3’,  sumo-3c-rev:  5’-cggaccctggaacagaacttccagaccaccaatctgttctctgtg-3’, ndei-his-for: 5’-gtttaactttaagaaggagatatacatatgatgggtcatcaccatcatc-3’.

for cloning into the psumo backbone  <cit> , the pace expression vectors were digested with ndei and xhoi restriction enzymes and the inserts were ligated into psumo vector digested with the same enzymes. a catalytic inactive mutant with substitution of the catalytic cysteine  <dig> to alanine was generated using the quikchange ii kit .

expression and purification
the following strains were transformed with the different vectors and tested for expression: e. coli bl <dig>  e. coli bl21plyss, e. coli rosetta , e. coli tuner and e .coli tunerplyss . expression was performed in shaking cultures in dyt medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, trace elements  and  <dig> %  glucose. for e. coli strains transformed with pet15b, pgemex or pace  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin was added to the medium; for psumo  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin was added to the medium. in case of e. coli strains e. coli rosetta, e. coli bl21plyss and e. coli tunerplyss additionally  <dig> μg/ml choramphenicol was added to the medium.

 <dig> ml dyt medium was inoculated with a single colony and incubated on a shaker at 37°c overnight. for inoculation of expression cultures the overnight culture was diluted 1: <dig> in the same medium. test expression cultures had a volume of  <dig> ml in  <dig> ml erlenmeyer flasks at different temperatures . the culture was grown until an od <dig> nm of  <dig>  was reached and expression was induced by addition of iptg  to a final concentration of  <dig>  -  <dig> mm. large scale expression was performed in  <dig> ml in baffled  <dig> l erlenmeyer flasks at 15°c for  <dig> h with a final iptg concentration of  <dig>  mm.

cells from expression cultures were harvested by centrifugation. cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold buffer a . cell pellets from small scale expression were disrupted by ultrasonic treatment whereas cells from large scale expression were broken by  <dig> passages through a french pressure cell at  <dig> mpa. typically,  <dig> g wet weight cells were used per batch of protein purification.

crude extracts from test expressions were centrifuged at 4°c at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes. supernatant and pellet fraction were mixed with sample buffer and analyzed on sds-page. crude extracts from large scale expression were centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min. all purification steps were performed at 4°c using a fplc system . the supernatant was applied to a cobalt-imac column  equilibrated in buffer a. absorption at  <dig> nm was monitored and column was washed with the same buffer until absorption reached baseline level again. three washing steps were performed with buffer a supplemented with  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm imidazole, respectively. the bound protein was eluted with buffer a containing  <dig> m imidazole. the pure protein was dialyzed against  <dig> l buffer a overnight, concentrated to  <dig> mg/ml and analyzed by sds-page and subsequent coomassie staining.

generation of isgylated cell lysates and deisgylation assay
usp <dig> deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts  were stimulated with  <dig> u/ml ifn β  for  <dig> h to induce isgylation of endogenous proteins or left untreated. mefs were lysed in  <dig> mm tris-cl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta, 1% triton x- <dig>  the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min at 4°c.  <dig> μl of the supernatant  were incubated with  <dig> μl  tfaaa-usp <dig> and  <dig> μl reaction buffer  for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h at 37°c. the reaction was stopped by addition of sds containing sample buffer. the samples were separated on a 12% sds-page gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed with the following antibodies: isg <dig>  <cit>  and β-actin . for quantification the optical densities of protein bands were obtained using imagej  <cit> . the densitometric values of free and conjugated isg <dig> were normalized to β-actin and depicted relative to the isg <dig> values in ifn β-treated cells at  <dig> h without addition of tfaaa-usp <dig> 

reaction with ubiquitin and isg <dig> vinyl sulfone
ha-ubiquitin  and ha-isg <dig> vinyl sulfone  were purchased from boston biochem.  <dig> μl  of tfaaa-usp <dig> or tfaaa-usp18-c61a was combined with  <dig> μl  ub-vs or isg15-vs, respectively. reaction was performed in  <dig> mm tris-cl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm sucrose,  <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> mm atp for  <dig> h at 37°c  <cit> . the samples were analysed on a coomassie-stained 10% sds-page gel.

measurement of isg15-amc cleavage
isg15-amidomethyl coumarin  was purchased from boston biochem. different amounts of tfaaa-usp <dig>  were incubated with  <dig> nm isg15-amc in a total volume of  <dig> μl. for each tfaaa-usp <dig> concentration duplicates were analyzed. the reaction was performed in  <dig> mm hepes-naoh ph  <dig> ,  <dig> %  tween  <dig>   <dig> mm dtt. the release of amc was detected over a period of  <dig> minutes using a safire ii fluorescence spectrophoto meter with excitation and emission wavelength of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively.

RESULTS
high-throughput screening requires large amounts of active protein. recombinant expression of usp <dig> in a bacterial system as well as in insect cells has been reported, however with very low yields  <cit> . until now, there has been no expression system available for production of sufficient amounts of recombinant usp <dig>  therefore, we aimed to establish a high-yield and easy-to-apply expression system for catalytically active usp <dig> 

expression trials using murine cdna for usp <dig> cloned into pet15b or a pgemex vector were performed in e. coli rosetta. however, no expression of his6-tagged usp <dig> could be observed in western blots . we reasoned that some rare codons in the cdna of the usp <dig> clone might obstruct expression and therefore switched to an expression construct with codons optimized for expression in e. coli. in addition, we introduced a sumo-tag at the n-terminus of usp <dig> as such a tag was reported to enhance expression levels of this protein in the baculovirus expression system  <cit> . sequence and ligation independent cloning  was performed to generate the his6-sumo-usp <dig> construct in the pace vector backbone  <cit>  . subsequently, e. coli bl <dig> as well as e. coli bl21plyss were used as host strains for test expressions. in contrast to the clone derived from mouse cdna, expression of the sumo-usp <dig> fusion protein could be detected in both e. coli strains on western blot with an anti-his6-tag specific antibody. however, expression levels of the fusion protein were too low to be detected on coomassie-stained sds-page gel .

n.d.: not determined, -: no expression observed, +: detectable on western blot, but not on coomassie-stained sds page gel, ++: detectable on coomassie-stained gel, but not the dominant band, +++: dominant band on coomassie-stained gel.

overproduction of soluble recombinant protein in e. coli can be limited by the deprivation of host cell chaperones that are required for correct folding of the respective protein. co-overexpression of e. coli chaperones was reported previously to enhance solubility and yield of recombinant proteins  <cit> . recently, also successful expression of a fusion of the chaperone trigger factor with the protein of interest was reported using a cold shock expression system in e. coli <cit>  . this system provides each translated protein its own chaperone. as the chaperone trigger factor  is the first chaperone newly translated proteins encounter  <cit>  we fused this chaperone to the n-terminus of usp <dig>  tf interacts with the bacterial ribosome and incorporates nascent polypeptide chains that emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel. in this way, it provides a protective environment that facilitates folding  <cit> . to assure interaction of usp <dig> with tf, which forms a large hydrophobic cradle, we introduced a long flexible linker consisting of six gss repeats between usp <dig> and the chaperone . moreover, the long linker ensures that the folded usp <dig> is accessible for substrates and not sterically blocked by tf.

tf binds to the ribosome via the motif 43-gfrxgxxp- <dig>  <cit> . although tf binds with low affinity to the ribosome  <cit> , overexpression of tf might become a serious problem for protein synthesis in the expression host. in order to reduce binding of the tf-usp <dig> fusion protein to the ribosome and facilitate dissociation, residues g <dig>  f <dig> and r <dig> of tf were exchanged to alanine . these residues have been shown previously to be critical for tf-ribosome interaction  <cit> .

the resulting fusion protein consists of an n-terminal his6-tag, sumo, trigger factoraaa, and usp <dig> . tfaaa-usp <dig> in the pace vector backbone was tested for expression in e. coli bl <dig>  and e. coli bl <dig>  plyss. in contrast to sumo-usp <dig>  insertion of tf increased expression levels so that the fusion protein could be detected on coomassie-stained sds-page gel . however, it did not represent the major fraction compared to endogenous bacterial proteins.

therefore, we changed the vector backbone from pace to psumo. this boosted expression of the fusion protein which now represented the major band on sds gel when expression was performed at 37°c . however, these expression conditions resulted in poor solubility of the protein as demonstrated by western blot with a his6-tag specific antibody . almost all recombinant protein was detected in the pellet fraction whereas only a weak band was detected in the soluble fraction. lowering temperature is often reported to increase yield and solubility of expressed proteins  <cit> . test expressions at 25°c had no observable effect and resulted in insoluble protein . decreasing further the expression temperature to 15°c yielded soluble tfaaa-usp <dig> . however, the drop in temperature caused also a severe decrease in protein expression .

to achieve again high expression levels combined with high solubility of tfaaa-usp <dig> we changed to the stringent expression host strains e. coli tuner and e. coli tunerplyss. tuner strains are deficient in lactose permease  and thus allow uniform uptake of iptg via diffusion. whereas e. coli tunerplyss only showed a weak expression of tfaaa-usp <dig>  strong expression of soluble fusion protein was observed when the e. coli tuner strain was grown at 15°c . therefore, these conditions were applied for large scale expression and purification.  <dig> liter expression cultures typically yielded  <dig> g of wet weight pellet. for purification of tfaaa-usp <dig>  different imac columns were tested of which a cobalt imac column provided the best results. using this column, pure tfaaa-usp <dig> was eluted allowing one-step purification without need of further purification steps . a minor band running at lower molecular weight was observed when the sample was boiled only for a short time or without fresh dtt added. this band most likely represents protein containing an intramolecular disulfide bond formed during boiling. typical yield was  <dig> mg pure protein out of  <dig> g wet weight pellet.

once expression and purification was established we checked whether the large scale preparations represent also catalytically active enzyme. therefore, we tested isopeptidase activity of tfaaa-usp <dig> towards isg <dig> modified cellular proteins . high levels of isgylated cellular protein were obtained using usp <dig> deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts  stimulated with ifn β. mef cell lysates were incubated with and without tfaaa-usp <dig> and changes in isgylation levels were monitored by western blot with an isg15-specific antibody. incubation with tfaaa-usp <dig> drastically decreased the amount of isgylated proteins, simultaneously the amount of free isg <dig> increased demonstrating the ability of the tfaaa-usp <dig> to recognize and cleave isg <dig> from cellular target proteins. to further evaluate enzymatic specificity, tfaaa-usp <dig> as well as a tfaaa-usp <dig> variant, where the catalytic cysteine is exchanged to alanine , were incubated with the suicide inhibitors ubiquitin vinyl sulfone  and isg <dig> vinyl sulfone , respectively. these suicide inhibitors form a covalent adduct upon reaction with the active site cysteine of ubiquitin-specific proteases. the reaction can be visualized as a shift in molecular mass on a coomassie-stained gel. for tfaaa-usp <dig>  covalent complex formation was detected with isg15-vs whereas mutation of the catalytic cysteine to alanine resulted in complete loss of the interaction. neither tfaaa-usp <dig> nor tfaaa-usp18-c61a showed cross-reactivity towards ub-vs . in summary, these experiments show that tfaaa-usp <dig> is catalytically active and underline its specificity towards isg <dig> 

screening for potential usp <dig> inhibitors requires a method that allows quantification of usp <dig> activity and is compatible with standard detection instruments. therefore, we established assay conditions for tfaaa-usp18-mediated isg15-amc cleavage. different amounts of the fusion protein were incubated with isg15-amc and cleavage was measured over a period of  <dig> minutes. the measured rate of isg15-amc cleavage was constant for more than  <dig> minutes and the rate increased linearly with enzyme concentration . at the highest concentration of tfaaa-usp <dig>  a slight decrease in the rate was observed after  <dig> minutes that is most likely due to a limitation of substrate and not caused by a decrease in enzyme activity. tf itself has no isopeptidase catalytic activity and does not interfere with the assay. these results demonstrate that tfaaa-usp <dig> is very well suited for kinetic analysis and the assay presented here can be easily adapted for high-throughput screening for specific inhibitors of usp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
today, the analysis of genomic and expressions array data provide a plethora of data on proteins in the regulation of vital cellular processes representing potential therapeutic targets. the entire process of drug development relies on the availability of correctly folded and active target proteins provided by heterologous production in eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems. however, for fast, efficient, and easy-to-scale-up expression e. coli is still the expression system of choice. here, we describe a new and efficient method to express and purify high yields of recombinant catalytically active usp <dig>  starting from zero expression we could boost the yields of active protein by optimization of codons, vector backbone, and a novel chaperone fusion system. the excellent yields obtained for usp <dig> put forward that this system is also very well suited for other proteins where recombinant expression failed so far.
