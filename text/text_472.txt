BACKGROUND
neuronal migration is a crucial process that allows neurons to reach their correct target location from the site of origin. it takes place mainly during the embryonic period but a significant number of neurons migrate after birth, well into adulthood. appropriate migration is essential for the construction of functional synaptic circuitries in the brain. a classical example is the migration of neurons related to sexual behaviours, such as the gonadotropin releasing hormone  neurons  <cit> , through the olfactory compartment and into the hypothalamus. gnrh+ neurons can be analysed in vitro using the immortalized and highly motile murine gn- <dig> cell line, which represents an ideal model to study the molecular bases of neuronal migration.

the ap-2α transcription factor is abundant in gn- <dig> cells and it is known to play a major role in controlling neuronal gene expression and nervous system development as demonstrated by several investigations  <cit> . in particular, genetic models such as zebrafish and mouse  <cit>  showed that ap-2α is essential for neural crest cell migration and its mutation results in apoptosis within this cell population. ap-2α is a member of the ap- <dig> family which consists of five closely related proteins of mr  <dig> , ap-2α, β, γ, δ and ε  encoded by distinct genes. these transcription factors can form homodimers or heterodimers via helix-span-helix motifs and transactivate their target genes by binding to gc-rich consensus sequences in the promoter regions  <cit> . dopamine β-hydroxylase  <cit> , human proenkephalin  <cit> , acetylcholinesterase  <cit> , rat luteinizing hormone receptor   <cit>  and neuropeptide y receptor  <cit>  are key genes for central nervous system biology which are known to be transcriptionally regulated by ap- <dig> proteins. in addition, ap- <dig> proteins regulate genes involved in certain neuropathologies, such as the presenilin- <dig> gene, involved in alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and the huntingtin gene, involved in huntington's disease  <cit> . a role for ap-2α protein in the biology of lhrh neurons has been demonstrated in vivo  <cit> ; in fact, lhrh expression was greatly decreased in ap-2α knock-out mice compared with controls. however, the mechanism leading to the inhibition of lhrh expression was not elucidated since a direct regulation for ap-2α on the lhrh promoter was not demonstrated.

here we present data showing the importance of ap-2α in the transcriptional regulation of genes that coordinate gn- <dig> neuron migration. we knocked down ap-2α expression by rna interference  and analysed migration and motility. we performed a microarray analysis to identify the genetic programme activated by ap-2α and observed the modulation of a master regulator of gnrh+ neuron migration, the adhesion related kinase  also called axl. we proved that axl is essential for gn- <dig> cell movement and that ap-2α directly regulates axl transcription by binding to canonical ap- <dig> binding sites present in the promoter of this gene. in addition, we present data demonstrating an essential role for ap-2α in mouse embryo fibroblast migration via the modulation of a distinct set of genes compared with gn- <dig> cells.

RESULTS
production of stable ap-2α knock-down gn- <dig> cells
gn- <dig> neurons were manipulated by rnai to down-regulate ap-2α, the only ap- <dig> family member that they express . four different sirna sequences were cloned in either psilencer  <dig> -u <dig> or psuperretro.puro expression vectors and expressed in gn- <dig> neurons following transfections and puromycin selection. the pires.puro <dig> selection plasmid was cotransfected with the psilencer  <dig> -u6-based vectors. after selection  <dig> empty control clones  as well as  <dig> clones expressing shrna-α <dig>  shrna-α <dig>  shrna-α <dig> or shrna-α <dig>  were isolated. each clone was analysed for vector integration in the genome by polymerase chain reaction . silencing was verified by western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  for all clones . clones α1-b, α1-c, α2-a, α4-b and α4-c showed the best ap-2α down-modulation compared with controls  and were further used for biological assays and gene expression profiling.

ap-2α modulates proliferation or migration in gn- <dig> neurons or mouse embryo fibroblasts
analysis of cell proliferation was performed for psil-empty or α1-b, α1-c, α2-a gn- <dig> clones. two of the three analysed clones showed increased proliferation rate at  <dig> hours, proportional to the level of ap-2α expression . in particular, the α2-a clone, which expressed the lowest level of ap-2α, showed a 3-fold increase in proliferation,  <dig> hours after starvation, suggesting that ap-2α controls gn- <dig> cell proliferation in a negative way. to understand the role of ap-2α in cell movement we compared the migration of control psil-empty or psuper-empty clones with low ap-2α-expressing clones in response to 10% foetal calf serum  by transwell assays. as shown in figure 1c reduced migration was observed for all ap-2α silenced clones, in particular α2-a and α4-c clones showed a 3-fold and a  <dig> -fold reduction, respectively. slighter reductions were observed for the other clones. a similar reduction in migration was observed when comparing ap-2α null versus wild-type or heterozygous mouse embryo fibroblasts  . motility was monitored in gn- <dig> neurons for control psil-empty and α1-b, α1-c and α2-a clones by wound healing assays . after wounding, cells were allowed to migrate for  <dig> hours to recover the wound. a 40–80% reduction in motility was observed in ap-2α low-expressing clones compared with control cells. in particular, the α2-a clone showed an 80% decrease in motility, while a slighter decrease was observed for the other clones.

identification of potential ap-2α regulated genes by microarray analysis
in order to identify which ap-2α regulated genes were involved in gn- <dig> neuron or mef migration, microarray analyses were performed. for gn- <dig> cells total rna was extracted from psuper-empty and α4-c clones and subjected to transcriptome analysis on illumina ref- <dig> beadchips. differential gene expression analysis revealed  <dig> modulated transcripts  in ap-2α silenced cells compared with controls . a complete list of genes is shown in additional file  <dig>  a partial list of the most relevant genes is shown in table  <dig>  where genes are distributed in different gene ontology  categories, such as cell cycle , apoptosis , development , extracellular matrix /cell adhesion  and cell migration . microarray data were validated by qrt-pcr for  <dig> genes shown to be involved in migration from the literature with a fold change greater than  <dig>   on two different rna preparations . data were normalized using the 18s or gapdh gene as internal controls. gene expression was analysed in ap-2α +/- and -/- mefs on agilent whole mouse genome  <dig> k platform and  <dig> modulated transcripts  were found . these results were validated by qrt-pcr for nine modulated genes randomly chosen  on three different rna preparations . also in this case the 18s or gapdh housekeeping gene was used for qrt-pcr normalization data. an overlapping group of  <dig> genes was identified comparing the two datasets , suggesting that some common mechanisms could be present in the different cellular systems but that most of the ap-2α-driven genetic programmes are cell-specific.

microarray analysis  was performed on gn- <dig> psuper-empty and ap-2α-low-expressing  clones in duplicate and  <dig> modulated genes were found . a selection of the most interesting modulated genes is shown. fc = fold change.

the gene lists obtained from gn- <dig> neurons and mouse embryo fibroblasts microarray analyses were compared and an overlapping group of genes was identified which is shown here. fc = fold change.

ingenuity pathway analysis of the newly identified ap-2α-regulated genes
to further evaluate the functional pathways in which the newly identified ap-2α-regulated genes are involved in gn- <dig> neurons and in mefs we used the ingenuity pathway analysis  system. two main molecular networks were identified for gn- <dig> neurons . the first network includes  <dig> genes associated with cellular movement , for instance tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases , metalloproteinases , the receptor tyrosine kinase axl, the chemokine  ligand  <dig>  and the cytochrome b <dig> reductase  <dig> . the second network is associated with cell growth and includes  <dig> genes , such as cdk <dig> regulatory subunit associated protein  <dig> , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a  and wnt <dig> inducible signalling pathway protein  <dig> . these results indicate that ap-2α first of all regulates a panel of genes involved in gn- <dig> migration and proliferation. when we performed the same analysis on the mef gene datasets two main molecular networks were identified . the first network is associated with cellular development and includes  <dig> genes such as notch gene homologues  <dig> and  <dig> , c-fos induced growth factor  and growth arrest specific- <dig>  . the second network includes  <dig> genes associated with cellular movement, for instance epidermal growth factor receptor , wingless-related mmtv integration site  <dig>  and secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig>  . for both cellular systems we identified a main network involved in cellular movement, however distinct pathways are activated.

ap-2α binds to the axl promoter and regulates its transcription
among the genes we identified as ap-2α regulated in gn- <dig> neurons, one in particular came to our attention, the axl gene, since it has been shown to control cell movement in gnrh+ neurons  <cit> . therefore, we studied its transcriptional regulation in more detail: we extracted its 5' genomic sequence  from the ensembl bank database  <cit>  and used  <dig> kb region upstream of the tss to look for ap-2α; binding sites using the canonical ap-2α; positional weight matrix .

three high score ap-2α binding sites were identified . ap-2α binding was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis in the region including the three high score sites, as shown in figure 8a, using three different anti-ap-2α antibodies. in order to test the function of the different ap-2α binding sites, 5' portions of the axl gene were cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid to generate pgl3-wt , pgl3-del <dig>  and pgl3-del <dig>  vectors. the wt vector was further mutated at the ap-2α binding site  <dig> and/or  <dig> and/or  <dig>  to generate Δ1; Δ2; Δ3; Δ <dig> ; Δ <dig> ; Δ <dig> ; Δ <dig> , <dig> vectors, as shown in figure 8b, left panel. these vectors were transiently transfected in the human or mouse hela, 293t, nih3t <dig> and nsc- <dig> cell lines, which are known to express the ap-2α and axl genes. the results obtained with hela cells are shown in figure 8b, right panel. the wt construct, which contains three intact ap-2α binding sites, showed the highest luciferase activity compared with del <dig> and del <dig> suggesting that this portion corresponds to the minimal promoter. deletion of the region including ap-2α binding site  <dig>  or  <dig> and  <dig>  led to a 20% and 80% reduction in reporter activity, respectively, compared with wt.

small deletions in the various ap-2α binding sites negatively modulated the luciferase reporter activity with different intensities depending on which or how many binding sites were mutated. when site  <dig> was mutated the most dramatic effect was observed suggesting that this site is the most responsive to ap-2α. however, reporter activity modulations occurred following mutations of any binding site which indicates that they are all functional. similar results were obtained when various constructs were transfected in nih3t <dig>  or nsc- <dig>  mouse cell lines  suggesting that this is a general regulation which does not depend on the cell type or species used. the direct response of the wt construct to ap-2α was tested in hela cells following transfection of pap-2α shrna <dig> , pspap-2α  or control empty vectors  <cit>  and reduced or increased luciferase activity were respectively observed  as further proof of ap-2α-dependent transcriptional regulation of the axl gene.

ap-2α regulates gn- <dig> migration via axl receptor tyrosine kinase 
to functionally investigate the role of axl in gn- <dig> cell migration, these neurons were transduced with the lentivirus vectors plko.1scr, plko.1axl <dig> or plko.1axl <dig> in order to obtain stable expression of either scrambled or specific axl shrnas. high  and specific axl gene silencing was obtained as measured by qrt-pcr . migration in response to serum was analysed in transwell assays and a decreased number of migrating cells  was observed following axl knock down suggesting a direct involvement of axl in cell migration  as a single gene or in cooperation with the other modulated genes identified by microarray analysis. it is interesting to note that the reduction of migration was of the same magnitude as after knocking down ap-2α suggesting that ap-2α exerts its effects on migration mainly via axl.

discussion
our work presents a direct connection between the transcription factor ap-2α and the migration of the murine gn- <dig> cells, gonadotropin-releasing hormone  immortalized neurons, which show high migratory activity. in the organism gnrh+ neurons migrate from the olfactory placode to the developing forebrain, to the septum and preoptic area of the hypothalamus and this migration is fundamental for the development of the normal reproductive functions  <cit> . for instance, in kallmann's syndrome patients, olfactory axon development and migration of gnrh+ neurons are impaired and this leads to a complex molecular pathogenesis which includes hypogonodotropic hypogonadism. this phenotypic alteration is secondary to a deficiency of gnrh in the hypothalamus with consequent lack of release of the pituitary gonadotropin luteinizing hormone  and follicle stimulating hormone , involved in gonadal maturation  <cit> . understanding the molecular mechanisms coordinated by ap-2α in gn- <dig> neuron migration can elucidate the role of ap- <dig> in the control of reproduction. no data are available for a possible role of ap-2α in reproduction since the knock-out models die perinatally  <cit> . by knocking down ap-2α, the only ap- <dig> isoform present in gn- <dig> cells, we demonstrated that ap-2α controls cell proliferation and cell movement via the activation of sets of specific genes interconnected with each other as revealed by microarray analysis and ipa. in particular, we demonstrated that migration depends on adhesion related kinase  gene expression induced by ap-2α following direct binding of this transcription factor to the canonical ap- <dig> binding sites present on axl promoter.

ap- <dig> proteins are known to play relevant roles in neuron gene expression regulation and nervous system development  <cit> . their expression coincides with specific developmental programmes such as the formation of the neural crest or the neural tube closure as demonstrated by ap-2α ablation in zebrafish  <cit>  and in mouse  <cit> . down-regulation of ap-2α in gn- <dig> neurons induces increased proliferation and the modulation of several genes known to be involved in cell cycle control such as cyclin d <dig> , cdkn2a, cell division cycle  <dig> homologue a  and wisp <dig>  interestingly, by comparing the microarray results obtained from gn- <dig> neurons and mefs analyses we observed opposite modulations for genes involved in proliferation . these discrepancies could explain why the ap-2α-dependent modulation of proliferation we observed for gn- <dig> neurons was opposite to what was found for mefs by pfisterer et al.  <cit>  suggesting that ap-2α is able to modulate the same genes in opposite directions depending on the cell context. however, our results are in line with previous ap-2α overexpression experiments which have shown induction of p21waf/cip and inhibition of dna synthesis and colony formation in various cell systems  <cit> . the direct mechanism of migration regulation by ap-2α in gnrh+ neurons found in our work is perfectly in agreement with the observations presented previously in  <cit> . kramer et al. revealed a decreased number of lhrh neurons in the brain of ap-2α-null mice at e <dig> –e <dig>  correlating with normal onset of ap-2α expression in lhrh neurons as they entered the central nervous system. one of the possibilities the authors suggested, among several, was that loss of ap-2α affected movement and migration of lhrh neurons to their appropriate target sites, however no molecular mechanism was presented at that time. from our microarray analysis in ap-2α silenced gn- <dig> neurons and ap-2α knock-out mefs we learned that a large group of genes, much larger than we hypothesized, involved in cell growth and/or cell movement is modulated by ap-2α. most of these genes were not known to be ap-2α direct or indirect targets therefore our investigation was essential in identifying gene expression profiles as well as the signal transduction pathways in which these genes operate. known ap-2α regulated genes were identified correctly, i.e. mmp <dig> .

some modulated genes involved in gn- <dig> neuron migration were tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases , metalloproteinase  <dig> , stathmin  <dig> , procollagens , wisp <dig> and the receptor tyrosine kinase axl. in ap-2α null mefs, epidermal growth factor receptor , wingless-related mmtv integration site  <dig> , coronin actin binding protein 1a  and secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig>  genes turned out to be regulated. it is important to observe that the genetic programmes activated seem to be cell-type dependent. since only a few genes, i.e. timps, mmps, procollagens and stathmin, turned out to be modulated in both gn- <dig> cells and mefs. the fact that ap-2α silencing in gn- <dig> neurons or in hela cells  <cit>  or ap-2α ablation in mefs led to decreased cell movement demonstrates that motility is depending on ap-2α transcription modulation in all of the cell systems analysed, but via distinct gene expression programmes. the pathway connections which involve the various ap-2α regulated genes identified by ipa and specifically involved in cell movement are under investigation. in this work we focused, in particular, on the ap-2α-driven transcription for the axl gene, in gn- <dig> neurons. it is known that this gene regulates gnrh+ cell migration  <cit>  and that it is differentially expressed in migratory gn- <dig> neuronal cells compared with the post-migratory gt1– <dig> cells  <cit> .

moreover, the ligand of axl, the growth arrest specific factor- <dig> , is able to stimulate lamellipodial extension, membrane ruffling and chemotaxis of immortalized gnrh+ neuronal cells via the axl receptor  <cit> . we demonstrated that axl is involved in serum-induced migration of gn- <dig> neuronal cells since down-modulation of axl expression led to decreased migration in agreement with the recent data obtained in  <cit> . we have presented data showing that the axl promoter contains three ap-2α binding sites, which are all functional as demonstrated by the analysis of axl transcription. however axl was not regulated in ap-2α-null mefs or in ap-2α-silenced hela cells  <cit> . this suggests that axl plays a major role in regulating ap-2α-driven migration in gn- <dig> cells, although axl-dependent cell movement has already been demonstrated for other kind of cells, i.e. breast tumour cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have shown that ap-2α regulates a large number of genes in cells expressing this transcription factor. however, the genetic programmes driven by ap-2α are different, depending on the cell type analysed. in particular, we proved that gn- <dig> neuron migration depends on axl expression which is directly linked to the presence of ap-2α. it has been recently demonstrated that axl and one of its family members, tyro <dig>  are able to modulate female reproduction by influencing gnrh+ neuron survival and migration  <cit> . based on these findings we can predict a connection between ap-2α, axl and reproduction. axl and ap-2α seem to co-localize in the various nuclei of the mouse adult brain analysed using the allen brain atlas  <cit> . this final observation suggests a major role for axl not only in gn- <dig> cells but generally in neurons that depend on ap-2α-driven transcription.
