BACKGROUND
a central feature in the maturation of hearing is a transition in the electrical signature of cochlear hair cells from spontaneous calcium spikes to graded receptor potentials  <cit> . the sequence of events associated with this transition are similar in mouse and chick , suggesting some commonalities between mammals and non-mammals as well as precocial and altricial animals. immature hair cells, even shortly after terminal mitosis, exhibit several classes of essential ion channels, including mechanotransduction channels  <cit> , voltage-gated calcium channels  <cit> , and delayed rectifier potassium channels  <cit> . at this pre-hearing developmental stage, fast-activating, low-threshold calcium channels facilitate broad, slowly repetitive calcium action potentials. spontaneous calcium spikes cease prior to the onset of hearing, due to the appearance of a slow voltage-gated potassium channel that drives down the hair cell's receptor potential and reduces the probability of calcium channel activity at rest  <cit> . even so, calcium action potentials still can be evoked with depolarization. these calcium spikes are capable of promoting exocytosis  <cit>  and post-synaptic activity  <cit> , presumably for neurotrophic support and synaptic refinement.

large-conductance bk-type potassium currents appear in hair cells at the transition from immature to mature excitability, coincident with the onset of hearing. rapid activation kinetics and sensitivity to both depolarization and calcium enable bk channels to provide effective feedback on calcium influx upon hair cell stimulation. the presence of bk channels eliminates calcium spikes  associated with immature hair cells  <cit>  and limits neurotransmission in mature hair cells  <cit> . at this point, the similarity in hair cell maturation in mammals and non-mammals diverges. in mammals, bk channels are primarily localized to the apicolateral membrane  <cit> , distant from basolateral voltage-gated calcium channels present at synaptic active zones. the calcium source driving a negative voltage activation range in mammalian hair cell bk channels remains unclear, but activity is regulated by sources other than voltage-gated calcium influx  <cit> . in non-mammalian vertebrates, bk channels are colocalized with voltage-gated calcium channels and synaptic release sites  <cit> . the proximity of these channels contributes to an electrical resonance in the receptor potentials of hair cells from fish, frogs, alligators, and chicks  <cit> . resonant frequency is systematically distributed along the auditory organ, corresponding to the sensitivity and selectivity of sound frequencies across the sensory epithelium and giving rise to an intrinsic electrical tuning mechanism  <cit> . variations in bk channel kinetics contribute to the wide range of resonant frequencies necessary for encoding sound, leading to the surprising conclusion that the molecular structure of hair cell bk channels must also be systematically varied along the frequency axis of the cochlea  <cit> . although the specific molecular underpinings of these functional effects remain unclear, alternative splicing of pore-forming α subunits and co-assembly with auxiliary β subunits have been proposed to play important roles  <cit> .

the appearance of bk currents in several species, therefore, is tied to both hair cell maturation and frequency tuning, essential features of normal hearing. even so, the mechanisms behind a late-stage appearance of bk currents at the onset of hearing are unknown. in the chick, these currents appear suddenly at e <dig>  <cit> , when there is a substantial improvement in hearing thresholds  <cit> . in this paper, we describe the development of bk channel gene and protein expression in chick cochlea, in order to determine whether changes in gene transcription, protein translation, or subunit trafficking underlie the sudden acquisition of bk currents. transcripts encoding the bk α subunit are present as early as e <dig>  shortly after terminal hair cell differentiation  <cit> . steady increases in transcript level up to e <dig> cannot explain the abrupt appearance of calcium-sensitive currents at that age. transcriptional control of highly calcium-sensitive isoforms, including those incorporating the α subunit splice variant strex and those co-assembled with β subunits, also cannot explain current acquisition at e <dig>  in contrast, immunostaining reveals the formation of bk plaques beginning when currents are acquired. thus, our results suggest that bk translation and trafficking are key regulatory events associated with the delayed acquisition of bk currents at the onset of hearing.

RESULTS
bk gene expression in cochlear development
real-time pcr was used to quantify the relative abundance of bk transcripts during late-stage cochlear development in the chick to test whether an upregulation of these transcripts near e <dig> could explain the acquisition of currents at this time point. taqman probes were developed for the pore-forming bk α subunit and the housekeeping gene s <dig> . an example of the cycle-by-cycle qpcr fluorescence data is shown in figure 1a for the s <dig> probe using serially diluted template. reactions were run in triplicate and the data proved highly reproducible even for low-copy templates amplifying at later cycles. efficiency curves were generated using serial dilutions of the total rna samples . this approach allowed us to test for amplification efficiency and for differential effects of reverse transcription depending on the amount of starting material. amplification efficiency is determined by least-squares fits to the dilution curves using a log <dig> scale. a slope of - <dig>  indicates an amplification efficiency of 100%. the slopes of the efficiency curves for αx and s <dig> were similar and near unity, validating the use of these probes for relative gene expression studies. qpcr products visualized on agarose gels were restricted to a single, specific amplicon of expected size . amplification curves for dissection saline and no-rt controls fell below threshold lines  or exhibited ct values far greater than the experimental samples .

the expression of αx was normalized to the housekeeping gene s <dig> and reported relative to levels at e <dig> . positive values indicate fold-increases in transcript level. gene expression steadily increased during these late embryonic ages, peaking in hatchlings at a level 6-fold greater than in e <dig>  expression levels decreased again as posthatch animals matured. the dependence on age was statistically reliable , but the stepwise changes in overall bk α expression is inconsistent with the sudden appearance of functional channels at the onset of hearing . another way to transcriptionally regulate functional currents is to specifically upregulate exceptionally calcium-sensitive isoforms at e <dig> - e <dig>  fourteen bk splice variants have been amplified or cloned from the chick cochlea  <cit>  and additional variants have been identified in other species. among these isoforms, inserts referred to as strex- <dig> and strex- <dig> have the greatest impact on apparent calcium affinity  <cit> . strex- <dig> is a  <dig> amino acid insert in the c-terminus tail of the bk α subunit. strex- <dig> is a concatenation of strex- <dig> incorporating an additional upstream insert  <dig> amino acids in length. both variants exhibit similar biophysical properties. a taqman probe was designed across the 3' splice junction between the  <dig> amino acid insert and the downstream constitutive exon, thereby targeting both strex- <dig> and strex- <dig> isoforms. the amplification efficiency for this probe was nearly identical to s <dig> and αx . to determine whether there was an upregulation of strex among the total population of bk α transcripts, the results were normalized to αx rather than the housekeeping gene s <dig>  the representation of strex among total bk transcripts steadily increased throughout development , increasing by 2-fold in posthatch animals compared with e <dig> . incorporation of the bk β <dig> subunit also increases bk calcium affinity  <cit> , providing another mechanism for transcriptional control of hair cell bk currents. although mrna encoding β <dig> has been found in avian and mammalian cochleae  <cit> , a role for this subunit in the physiology of mature hair cells remains unclear  <cit> . nevertheless, it is possible that the developmental regulation of bk β <dig> could explain the sudden appearance of calcium-sensitive currents at e18-e <dig>  although the amplification efficiency for this probe was nearly 100%, the mean cts typically fell between  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that β <dig> transcripts were low-abundant. when normalized to αx, expression data showed a surprising decrease  in β <dig> coincident with the onset of hearing .

bk protein expression in cochlear development
developmental changes in αx, strex, and β <dig> mrna levels cannot account for the sudden changes in bk function. to determine whether a delay in protein translation could underlie the late appearance of currents, bk protein expression was analyzed immunohistochemically. tall hair cells residing along the superior edge of the papilla are primarily innervated by afferent fibers and are the cells most associated with electrical tuning and bk function. radial sections were cut through cryopreserved temporal bones and collected such that each slide had representative sections throughout the long, frequency axis of the cochlea. sections were stained for anti-bk reactivity using a polyclonal antibody raised against a c-terminus fragment of the mouse α subunit . western blot analysis confirmed the specificity of this antibody to chick bk α subunits . no-primary controls were immunonegative . exemplar images are shown in figure  <dig> from basal, middle, and apical cross-sections of e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> basilar papilla. images were cropped to focus on the sensory epithelium, and each panel was arranged in a similar orientation for simplicity . immunopositive nerve fibers project from the cochlear ganglion  up to the base of the tall hair cells lining the superior-most portion of the hair cell layer. this staining was intense at e <dig> and e <dig> but faint at e <dig>  a similar pattern was observed in several specimens. the strong anti-bk signal in cochlear projections at e <dig> coincides with late stages of synaptogenesis, extensive remodeling of peripheral synaptic endings  <cit> , and maturation of ionic currents in the cochlear ganglion  <cit> . bk channels have been described in the mammalian auditory nerve  <cit> , and there is evidence of voltage- and calcium-sensitive potassium currents in chick cochlear ganglion as well  <cit> . antibody label was concentrated, often in a punctate pattern, at the base of the tallest hair cells, but it was difficult to distinguish between staining in the hair cell membrane and the nerve terminal.

to specifically investigate the emergence of anti-bk label in hair cells, immunocytochemical procedures were conducted on mechanically isolated hair cell preparations. similar single-cell preparations have been used to identify the expression of bk channels in mammalian inner hair cells  <cit>  and voltage-gated calcium channels in bullfrog saccular hair cells  <cit> . for these experiments, several polyclonal bk α antibodies were used with similar results . data presented in the remainder of this report reflect staining from alomone apc- <dig> anti-bk. the bk α subunit is highly alternatively spliced, and most antibodies--including the chemicon antibody used in figure 2--target epitopes that cross splice boundaries or include sequence from alternative exons. in contrast, the alomone apc- <dig> anti-bk targets an epitope common to all splice forms. specificity for the chick bk α homologue was confirmed using western blot . in chick cochlear hair cells isolated from e <dig> and e <dig> animals, the brightest anti-bk label was intracellular . confocal stacks clarified that this label was intranuclear. while surprising, this pattern is similar to that in chick ciliary ganglion at the same embryonic ages  <cit> . diffuse cytoplasmic staining at e <dig> to e <dig> gave way to punctate staining from e <dig> onward. punctate clusters in posthatch hair cells were located in subnuclear regions and appeared to be associated with the plasma membrane. notably, the appearance of bk clusters coincided with the appearance of calcium-sensitive bk currents at e18-e <dig>  these data strongly suggest that translation and trafficking of bk subunits into clustered domains, likely near voltage-gated calcium sources, underlie the delayed and sudden acquisition of bk currents during hair cell maturation.

these data also revealed an apparent translocation of bk puncta from supranuclear domains to subnuclear regions during development. to illustrate this in greater detail, additional isolated hair cell preparations underwent immunocytochemical analysis combining anti-bk immunofluorescence with markers for the actin-rich hair bundle and the nucleus, in order to clearly identify the position of bk clusters relative to these landmarks . again, no puncta were present at early embryonic ages . puncta appeared in supranuclear regions at e <dig>  in contrast, bk puncta were concentrated in subnuclear regions from e <dig> onward. this pattern was replicated in several independent experiments and in numerous hair cells imaged at these ages. it is unclear whether the apparent movement of channels across the length of the cell reflects lateral diffusion of established plaques within the plasma membrane or de novo translation and trafficking of independent clusters.

the occurrence of bk-puncta was quantified across the developmental ages reported in figure  <dig>  in young embryos between e <dig> and e <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> cells  exhibited anti-bk puncta. in late-stage embryos between e <dig> and e <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> cells  exhibited one or more anti-bk puncta. in cells isolated from posthatch basilar papillae between p <dig> and p <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> cells  showed punctate label. in  <dig> cells from p <dig> basilar papillae, the average number of puncta per cell was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , when counting only those spots twice the fluorescence intensity of background levels. the number of puncta per cell ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  other spots differentially above background could be visually identified  but failed to meet the two-times-background criterion.

localization of anti-bk puncta to the surface of the hair cell membrane was supported by confocal microscopy . cuts through reconstructed z-stacks showed that puncta were always positioned along the membrane border rather than internally . based on the neuronal labeling in figure  <dig>  it was possible that bk puncta reflected residual post-synaptic terminals rather than pre-synaptic clusters in the hair cell membrane. to address this possibility, we labeled isolated hair cells with pre- and post-synaptic markers to identify prevalence of post-synaptic terminals in our preparations and to determine the relationship between bk puncta and the synaptic active zone. anti-glur <dig> staining was negative on dissociated cells , suggesting that terminals were adequately removed during enzymatic treatment and mechanical dissociation. co-label experiments with antibodies to bk channels and the synaptic ribbon protein ribeye  revealed a dislocalization of bk clusters and active zones . staining for the ribbon synapse can be considered a proxy for the location of synaptic active zones, even though the postsynaptic membrane covers a larger surface area than that marked by the ribbon itself  <cit> . for bk plaques to be associated with terminals, the postsynaptic footprint would have to be large enough to encapsulate both bk and ribbon puncta. such a large amount of extraneous membrane would be visible under dic optics. however, images in figures  <dig> and  <dig> were taken from hair cells exhibiting a smooth surface. these data support an association between bk plaques and the hair cell membrane, and they challenge the widely held view that bk channels and voltage-gated calcium channels are clustered at presynaptic active zones in non-mammalian hair cells  <cit> . this observation requires further study, but it is possible that channel density at active zones is below our detection limits.

functional correlate of a delay in bk surface expression
the magnitude of calcium-sensitive bk currents in the development of the chick basilar papilla has been quantified previously  <cit> . in that study, bk current substantially increased between e <dig> and e <dig>  from little measurable calcium-sensitive current at the younger age to maximum levels only one day later. since embryogenesis is highly dependent on flock age and health, incubation temperature, air flow around the egg, and humidity levels  <cit> , we confirmed the time course of bk functional development using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. to isolate these currents,  <dig> mm 4-ap was included in the intracellular  solution to block slowly-activating delayed rectifier potassium channels  <cit> . the remaining fast-activating current was attributed to bk, and this was subsequently verified by removing extracellular calcium, leading to the elimination of the fast current . cells from animals at e <dig> and older exhibited this fast-activating, calcium-sensitive current, but cells from earlier ages showed no bk current, as reported previously . the average steady-state currents measured during voltage steps to  <dig> mv were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa for posthatch ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa for e <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa for e <dig>  . all recordings were obtained from tall hair cells located 20% to 50% from the apical end of the papilla. these currents may be contaminated by small amounts of residual delayed rectifier channels, but the presence of a fast-activating current suggests that clustered channels at e <dig> are functional and sensitive to extracellular calcium.

the developmental time course for this current not only reflects changes in bk channel surface expression but also any change in the density of plasmalemmal calcium channels, the colocalization of bk and calcium channels, and intracellular calcium buffering. to assess changes in bk channel density specifically, the basolateral surface of tall hair cells was scanned for bk fluctuations using cell-attached patch recordings. in this way, large depolarizations could be used to detect the presence of bk channels in the membrane, regardless of the local intracellular calcium concentration or the apparent calcium affinity of the channel itself. an example of cell-attached patch records is shown in figure 5b. in this patch, currents flickered between a closed current baseline and a single open-channel current level, indicating the presence of one channel in the patch. all-points histograms were generated to estimate changes in open probability and single-channel current amplitude. for the example in figure 5b, open probability increased with more negative pipette potentials . single-channel conductance was estimated to be about  <dig> ps , consistent with large-conductance bk channels under these recording conditions. reversal occurred at approximately - <dig> mv , indicating that the channel was potassium selective. repeated attempts at cell-attached patch recordings in embryonic cochleae resulted in sporadic observations of bk-mediated current fluctuations. to systematically investigate this observation, we recorded the proportion of patches containing bk channels in hair cells from e17-e <dig> embryos and p2-p <dig> posthatch animals. the presence of bk currents in cell-attached patches was noted if single-channel fluctuations were  voltage dependent,  k+ selective, and  large conductance . using these criteria, only 10% of patches from e17-e <dig> hair cells included bk channels whereas over 50% of patches from posthatch animals exhibited bk-related fluctuations . since the patches were obtained from the basal pole of hair cells, these results support the conclusions drawn from the immunocytochemistry data in figure  <dig>  showing an apparent translocation of bk channels from supranuclear to subnuclear regions.

discussion
calcium-dependent bk current appears at the onset of hearing in hair cells of both mammalian and non-mammalian species, but the mechanisms underlying acquisition of this important current remain unknown. transcriptional upregulation of bk-related mrna would be the simplest explanation for sudden changes in function. however, our results demonstrated a steady increase in bk mrna during maturation of the chick cochlea, increasing only 6-fold over the week prior to hatching. moreover, developmental changes in the mrna levels of highly calcium-sensitive subunits were unable to explain functional changes. considerable effort has been expended in the past decade to correlate mrna levels with protein expression in a variety of systems . the results clearly illustrate a nonlinear and dynamic progression from gene expression to protein function, indicating that mrna analysis is an insufficient predictor of protein expression levels and functional effects  <cit> . these studies argue for a combined approach, focusing on both gene and protein expression. while it remains possible that upregulation of other splice variants contributes to a rapid functional time course, our results show a close correspondence between the acquisition of bk currents at e18-e <dig> and the appearance of anti-bk clusters in the basolateral membrane, implicating translation, trafficking, and scaffolding processes as rate-limiting steps in bk function.

although bk channels are eventually clustered in different regions of the plasma membrane in mammals and non-mammals, the developmental sequence of anti-bk reactivity is strikingly similar across species beginning with diffuse cytoplasmic staining at early ages and ending with plaque formation at the onset of hearing. in mouse, cytoplasmic label was found as early as e <dig>  <cit> , shortly after terminal differentiation of the hair cell in this species  <cit> . similarly, we found immunopositive reactions in isolated chick hair cells as early as e <dig> in chick, only several days after terminal mitosis  <cit> . diffuse cytoplasmic staining was accompanied by more intense label within the nucleus. although it is tempting to dismiss this label as nonspecific, the pattern mirrors that described in ciliary ganglion  <cit>  so the presence of full-length subunits or truncated peptides may represent an unknown dual-use of kcnma <dig>  there is mounting evidence for such multifunctional genes  <cit> . for example, the synaptic ribbon protein ribeye and the transcriptional repressor ctbp <dig> are encoded by alternative splicing in the same gene  <cit> , leading to both nuclear and active zone immunolabel when using antibodies directed against the common c-terminal domain of ribeye/ctbp <dig>  <cit> . dual uses of ion channel gene products also have been reported. posttranslational cleavage of the l-type voltage-gated calcium channel cav <dig>  results in a c-terminal fragment that is capable of nuclear translocation and regulation of gene transcription  <cit> .

two distinct bk currents have been recorded in mammalian inner hair cells  <cit> , including major and minor components that are, respectively, insensitive and sensitive to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. immunolocalization of bk channels in these hair cells has revealed significant extrasynaptic labeling at apicolateral domains  <cit> . however, there is evidence for dot-like basolateral expression using both antibody staining and fluorescently tagged bk toxins  <cit> . although direct evidence is lacking, the basolateral and apicolateral expression of bk may correlate with calcium sensitive and insensitive current components at synaptic and extrasynaptic locations, respectively. in the current study, colabeling experiments combining anti-bk with a marker for synaptic active zones  revealed extrasynaptic expression in chick as well. this result was surprising based on indirect empirical evidence and theoretical models of electrical tuning that all support the colocalization of voltage-gated calcium channels and bk channels at synaptic active zones in lower vertebrate hair cells  <cit> . our results could arise from lateral diffusion of bk plaques within the plasma membrane after hair cell isolation, but such diffusion is unlikely since the cells are fixed with cross-linking aldehydes within minutes after isolation. alternatively, presynaptic bk channels may occur at a low density below our detection limits. these issues must be resolved to fully understand calcium signaling at the hair cell synapse and the relationship between this signaling and electrical tuning in non-mammalian vertebrates.

bk immunoreactivity was detected as early as e <dig> in the soma of chick auditory neurons  and in afferent processes as early as e <dig>  indicating that remodeling and trafficking of bk subunits occurs in auditory nerve, as well as sensory hair cells, during late stages of functional maturation. this is the first description of bk channels in axonal projections of auditory neurons, and these data suggest an influence on postsynaptic signaling. nevertheless, the presence of bk channels in both hair cells and afferent projections raises the possibility that bk puncta on isolated hair cells arise from postsynaptic membrane fragments. however, several pieces of evidence support an association of these puncta with the hair cell membrane:  images were selectively taken from cells exhibiting a smooth, birefringent membrane devoid of obvious postsynaptic footprints,  bk puncta first appear in isolated cells at e <dig>  several days after label is seen in dendritic projections,  glur <dig> labeling was negative on hair cells,  anti-bk puncta were distant from synaptic active zones where postsynaptic membrane fragments are most likely found, and  the translocation of bk clusters to the base of the cell between e <dig> and ph mirrors a change in the prevalence of bk in cell-attached patches.

surface expression of clustered, functional bk channels is an essential feature in hair cell maturation, but the mechanisms involved in these processes remain unknown. further, it is unclear whether surface expression, scaffolding into clusters, and trafficking to distinct microdomains is a sequential process or a simultaneous, coordinated event. for example, diffuse antibody label at early embryonic ages in chick  appeared cytoplasmic, but it is also possible that a portion of this immunoreactivity included membrane bound protein. previous studies have identified several mechanisms for adjusting the density of these channels in the plasma membrane, including the expression of dominant negative, cytoplasmically retentive isoforms and co-expression with regulatory chaperones. retentive bk α isoforms include the alternatively spliced c-terminus variant ending in vedec  <cit>  and a novel variant  containing the retention signal cvlf  <cit> . variants containing vedec have been described in rat and chick cochlea  <cit> , but variants incorporating the cvlf motif have yet to be described in the auditory periphery of either species. in addition, a  <dig> amino-acid variant in the cytoplasmic tail of the bk α subunit contains a canonical er retention signal . while this variant alters the biophysics of the channel, there is currently no evidence that this isoform alters surface expression in native tissue or heterologous expression systems  <cit> . interestingly, intracellular retention of vedec can be rescued by a variety of chaperones  <cit> . therefore, surface expression may be tied to transcript levels of specific isoforms as well as co-assembly with interacting proteins.

a compendium of bk channel interaction partners is emerging from yeast-two-hybrid screens, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies, and mass spectrometry approaches  <cit> . the most complete study of the bk interactome identified partners classically associated with an array of cellular processes, including metabolism, trafficking/scaffolding, differentiation, signaling, transport, and transcription/translation  <cit> . in that study, more than  <dig> potential interactors were identified with a co-immunoprecipitation strategy. the bk α antibody used to pull-down complexed subunits was a commercially available polyclonal antibody raised against the c-terminus splice form ending in vedec. as a result, the study may have identified only a subset of candidate molecules. it remains to be seen whether additional interactors might be found using antibodies specific to other mutually exclusive c-terminus splice variants. even so, over 20% of the candidate partners identified by kathiresan et al.  were involved in trafficking and scaffolding. molecules involved in scaffolding proteins in macromolecular complexes include β-catenin  <cit> , rack <dig>  <cit> , magi <dig>  <cit> , caveolin  <cit> , lin7c  <cit> , and the l-type voltage-gated ca2+ channel β subunit  <cit> . several of these interactors are ideal candidates for colocalizing bk channels and voltage-gated calcium channels at either extrasynaptic or synaptic domains.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sought to combine mrna expression data and protein expression studies to identify the key events underlying a late acquisition of bk channel currents in hair cell development. the results implicate regulation of bk trafficking in this process, surprisingly to extrasynaptic domains. however, it is unclear whether this process is a purely post-transcriptional event. transcriptional control of scaffolding or chaperone elements could still underlie the sudden appearance of bk current at the onset of hearing, possibly tied to the cessation of spontaneous calcium spikes prior to the onset of hearing. in future experiments, it will be important to interfere with transcription, translation, and bk interactors in order to identify the relevant mechanisms.
