BACKGROUND
the genus mycobacterium consists of ~ <dig> species  <cit> , of which some are leading human and animal pathogens. tuberculosis , the most important mycobacterial disease, is caused by genetically related species commonly referred to as "the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex" . m. leprae and m. ulcerans are respectively the causative agents for two other important diseases, leprosy and buruli ulcer  <cit> . besides the three major diseases, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis causes john's disease  and is also suspected to cause crohn's disease in humans  <cit> . in addition, m. avium and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria  have become important opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised humans and animals  <cit> .

mycobacteria have versatile lifestyles and habitats, complexities also mirrored by their physiology. while some can be obligate intracellular pathogens   <cit> , others are aquatic inhabitants, which can utilize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons   <cit> . the biology of pathogenic mycobacteria remains an enigma, despite their importance in human and veterinary medicine. except for the mycolactone of m. ulcerans, glycolipids  and proteins  of mtc species  <cit> , largely, in contrast to most bacterial pathogens, pathogenic mycobacteria lack obvious virulence factors and the mechanisms in which they cause diseases are still obscure  <cit> . genome sequencing projects have provided invaluable tools that are accelerating the understanding of the biology of pathogenic mycobacteria. as such, genome sequencing data has guided the characterization of genes/pathways for microbial pathogens, accelerating discovery of novel control methods for the intractable mycobacterial diseases  <cit> .

the rhomboid protein family exists in all life kingdoms and has rapidly progressed to represent a ubiquitous family of novel proteins. the knowledge and the universal distribution of rhomboids was engendered and accelerated by functional genomics  <cit> . the first rhomboid gene was discovered in drosophila melanogaster as a mutation with an abnormally rhomboid-shaped head skeleton  <cit> . genome sequencing data later revealed that rhomboids occur widely in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes  <cit> . many eukaryotic genomes contain several copies of rhomboid-like genes   <cit> , while most bacteria contain one homolog  <cit> .

despite biochemical similarity in mechanism and specificity, rhomboid proteins function in diverse processes including mitochondrial membrane fusion, apoptosis and stem cell differentiation in eukaryotes  <cit> . rhomboid proteases are also involved in life cycles of some apicomplexan parasites, where they participate in red blood cell invasion  <cit> . rhomboids are now linked to general human diseases such as early-onset blindness, diabetes and pathways of cancerous cells  <cit> . in bacteria, aara of providencia stuartii was the first rhomboid homolog to be characterized, which was shown to mediate a non-canonical type of quorum sensing in this gram negative species  <cit> . since then, bacterial rhomboids are being characterized, albeit at low rate; glup of bacillus subtilis is involved in cell division and glucose transport  <cit> , while glpg of escherichia coli  <cit>  was the first rhomboid to be crystallized, paving way for delineation of the mechanisms of action for rhomboid proteases  <cit> .

although universally present in all kingdoms, not all rhomboids are active proteases  <cit> . lemberg and freeman  <cit>  defined the rhomboid family as genes identified by sequence homology alone, and the rhomboid proteases as a subset that includes only genes with all necessary features for predicted proteolytic activity. as such, rhomboid-like genes in eukaryotic genomes are classified into the active rhomboids, inactive rhomboids  and a diverse group of other proteins related in sequence but predicted to be catalytically inert. the eukaryotic active rhomboids are further divided into two subfamilies: the secretase rhomboids that reside in the secretory pathway or plasma membrane, and the parl subfamily, which are mitochondrial  <cit> .

despite their presence in virtually all eubacteria, there is a paucity of information about the functions of bacterial rhomboids. hitherto, full phylogenetic analysis of rhomboids from the complex and populous prokaryotes has not been done; although it can provide important functional and evolutionary insights  <cit> , it is a huge and difficult task to perform at once. many species of mycobacteria contain two copies of rhomboid homologs whose sequences have not been investigated for the presence of functional signatures. furthermore, actinobacteria can have up to five copies of rhomboids, the significance of which is currently not known. this study aimed at determining the distribution, evolutionary trends and bioinformatic analysis of rhomboids from an important genus -mycobacterium.

herein we report that mycobacterial rhomboids are active proteases with different evolutionary history, with rv <dig> orthologs representing a group of prokaryotic rhomboids whose progenitor may be the ancestor for eukaryotic rhomboids.

RESULTS
a quest for the role of rhomboids in mycobacteria is overshadowed by their diverse functions across kingdoms and even within species. their presence across kingdoms implies that rhomboids are unusual useful factors that originated early in the evolution of life and have been conserved  <cit> . however, neither the reason for their implied significance nor the path of their evolution are understood; the key to answering these questions is rooted in understanding not only the sequence distribution of these genes, but more importantly, their functions across evolution  <cit> . this study reports that mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid-serine-proteases with different evolutionary history. reverse transcriptase-pcrs on mycobacterial mrna indicate that both copies of rhomboids are transcribed.

the distribution of rhomboids in mycobacteria: a nearly conserved rhomboid with unique genome organization across the genus
in determining the distribution of rhomboid homologs in mycobacteria, we used the two rhomboids of m. tuberculosis h37rv, rv <dig>  and rv <dig>  as reference and query sequences. many mycobacterial genomes contained two rhomboids, which were orthologous either to rv <dig> or rv <dig>  however, there was only one homolog in the genomes of the mac  species, m. leprae and m. ulcerans, which were orthologous either to rv <dig>  or rv <dig> . m. ulcerans was the only mycobacterial species with an ortholog of rv <dig> as a sole rhomboid. thus, with the exception of m. ulcerans which had a rhomboid-like element , there is a genome-wide conservation of the rhomboids orthologous to rv <dig>  in mycobacteria .

despite evolutionary differences across the genus, the rv <dig> mycobacterial orthologs shared a unique genome organization at the rhomboid locus, with many of the rhomboid surrounding genes conserved . typically, upstream and downstream of the rhomboid were cysm  and mur <dig>  encoding genes. since rv <dig> orthologs are almost inseparable from mur <dig> and cysm, it is likely that they are co-transcribed  or functional partners. as such, we may consider the cluster containing mycobacterial rv <dig> orthologs as a putative operon. according to sassetti et al  <cit> , many of the rhomboid surrounding genes are essential while others  are required for the survival of the tubercle bacillus in macrophages  <cit> .

despite massive gene decay in m. leprae, ml <dig> rhomboid had similar genome arrangement observed for mycobacterial species. upstream of ml <dig> were gene elements  ml <dig>  ml <dig> and ml <dig> . similar to m. lepare, the mac species also had an ortholog of rv <dig> as a sole rhomboid; perhaps the ortholog of rv <dig> was lost in the progenitor for mac and m. leprae . in contrast to most mycobacterial genomes, cysm was further upstream the m. marinum rhomboid ; and despite being genetically related to mtc species  <cit> , mmar_  <dig> does not share much of the genome organization observed for rv <dig> mtc orthologs .

the rhomboid-like element of m. ulcerans  was identical to mmar_ <dig>  with a  <dig> bp insertion at the beginning and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms . perhaps the insertion disrupted the open reading frame  of mul_ <dig>  converting it into a pseudogene. interestingly, mul_ <dig> nearly assumed the unique organization observed for mycobacterial orthologs of rv <dig>  in which the rhomboid element was upstream of mur <dig> 

the functional and evolutionary significance for the unique organization of the rv <dig> orthologs in mycobacteria is not clear. since physiological roles are not yet ascribed to mycobacterial rhomboids, it is not certain whether mul_ <dig>  would mimic similar roles in that it almost assumed similar genomic organization . however, the fact that m. ulcerans is a new species  that has undergone reductive evolution, mul_ <dig> could be a consequence of these recent phenomena  <cit> . interestingly, mul_ <dig> was the only rhomboid-like element in mycobacteria.

in contrast, the genome organization for rv <dig> orthologs was not conserved, and mirrored the genetic relatedness of mycobacteria . as such, the orthologs from mtc species, m. marinum and m. ulcerans, which are genetically related and are assumed to have the same m. marinum-like progenitor  <cit>  had similar organization for rv <dig> ortholog. downstream and upstream of the rhomboid were respectively, the transmembrane acyltransferase and the proline-glutamate polymorphic gc rich-repetitive sequence  encoding genes. pe-pgrs occurs widely in m. marinum and mtc genomes  <cit>  but it was a pseudogene upstream mul_ <dig> of m. ulcerans. the distances between mtc rv <dig> orthologs and the neighboring genes were long, in contrast to the short distances between rv <dig> rhomboids and their neighboring genes.

similarly, the genome organization for the rv <dig> orthologs of m. gilvum, m. vanbaalenii and mycobacterium species m.jls, mkms and mmcs was also similar. upstream and downstream the rhomboid was, respectively, the glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein/dioxygenase encoding gene and a gene that encodes a hypothetical protein. in contrast to mtc species, the rv <dig> orthologs in these species were close or contiguous with the neighboring genes . the genome organization of mab_ <dig> of m. abscessus and msmeg_ <dig> of m. smegmatis were unique to these species .

many bacterial genomes contain a single copy of rhomboid. however, filamentous actinobacteria such as streptomyces coelator and streptomyces scabiei have as many as four or five copies of rhomboid-like genes. since multi-copy rhomboids in prokaryotic genomes are not yet characterized, it is not certain whether prokaryotic rhomboids can also have diverse functions, similar to multi-copy rhomboids in eukaryotic genomes. mycobacteria and actinobacteria at large exhibit diverse physiological and metabolic properties. it remains to be determined whether the diversity in number, nature and functions of rhomboids can contribute to the complex lifestyles of these organisms  <cit> .

similarity between the two mycobacterial rhomboid paralogs
across the genus, the similarity between the two mycobacterial rhomboid paralogs was as low as that between prokaryotic and eukaryotic rhomboids   <cit> . since paralogs perform biologically distinct functions  <cit> , the two mycobacterial rhomboids may have distinct roles. eukaryotic rhomboid paralogs are also dissimilar and differ in functions in a particular species  <cit> . in contrast, the orthologs had significantly high homology , with an average identity of 74%. rv <dig> orthologs within the mtc and mac species had an identity of ~100% while those from other mycobacterial species had identities ranging from  <dig> to 78% . the exception was mab_ <dig> of m. abscessus, which shared a significantly low homology with rv <dig> . this could be due to the large evolutionary distance between m. abscessus and other mycobacteria. since proteins of ~70% identity or more are likely to have similar functions  <cit> , mab_ <dig> may have unique roles.

the two mycobacterial rhomboids were acquired independently
to determine evolutionary relationship between the two rhomboid paralogs, phylogenetic analysis was done and included distant eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboids. the mycobacterial rhomboids clustered into two distinct clades with high bootsrap values , indicating that the rhomboids could have been acquired independently . each clade consisted of rhomboids orthologous either to rv <dig> or rv <dig>  grouped according to genetic relatedness of mycobacteria  <cit> , with mab_ <dig> of m. abscessus appearing the most distant. the phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the two mycobacterial rhomboids are paralogs, but their progenitor could not be determined. thus, the mycobacterial rhomboid paralogs may be "outparalogs"  preceding a speciation event  <cit> ), while the orthologs could have originated from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor  <cit> ). the neighbor-joining and minimum evolution phylogenetic trees were compared and gave almost comparable results.

the rv <dig>  mycobacterial orthologs  clustered with eukaryotic secretase and parl rhomboids with a high bootstrap value . when grouped with eukaryotic irhoms, the bootstrap value for this clade increased to 90%, with irhoms forming a distinct clade . the rv <dig> mycobacterial orthologs may represent prokaryotic rhomboids with similar lineage or progenitor for eukaryotic active rhomboids. this was previously noted by koonin et al  <cit> , who hinted on a subfamily of eukaryotic rhomboids that clustered with rhomboids of gram positive bacteria. indeed, the rv <dig> mycobacterial orthologs contained extra eukaryotic motifs and have topologies similar to that of rho- <dig> of drosophila. koonin et al  <cit>  alluded that rhomboids could have emerged in a bacterial lineage and were eventually widely disseminated  by horizontal transfer  <cit> . conversely, the rv <dig> mycobacterial orthologs  formed a distinct clade, different from rv <dig> mycabacterial orthologs. these rhomboids appeared evolutionary stable and did not cluster with eukaryotic rhomboids.

mab_ <dig> of m. abscess which had low homology with rv <dig> also appeared distant and clustered poorly with mycobacterial orthologs, in contrast with its paralog mab_ <dig> . since orthologs have an ancestral gene in the last common ancestor  <cit> , mab_ <dig> could be a "pseudoortholog" . in phylogenetic analysis of mycobacterial rhomboids orthologous to rv <dig>  mab_ <dig> was also distant from rhomboids of other actinobacteria . since m. abscessus is one of the earliest species to diverge of all mycobacterial species  <cit> , the low homology could reflect evolutionary distance or stability of this rhomboid. however, the high homology of mab_ <dig>  contrasts the low homology of mab_ <dig> , negating the notion of evolutionary distance and instead favors evolutionary stability of mab_ <dig> 

mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid-serine-proteases
multiple sequence alignment revealed that all mycobacteria rhomboids contain the putative rhomboid catalytic residues gly <dig>  ser <dig> and his <dig>  the mycobacterial rhomboids also contained two additional c-terminal histidins  and five invariant transmembrane residues  that are also conserved in many rhomboid proteins  <cit> . however in mycobacteria, ala <dig> which occurs in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboids was substituted by gly . furthermore, tyr <dig> which stabilizes the rhomboid protease active site of glpg  <cit>  and of many rhomboid proteases was only conserved in mab_ <dig> of m. abscessus, being substituted by phe in mycobacterial rhomboids . thus, phe is the stabilizing residue in the protease active site for majority of mycobacterial rhomboids .

the nature of the transmembrane helices  formed by mycobacterial rhomboids was analyzed to determine whether they conform to those of active rhomboid proteases. mycobacterial orthologs of rv <dig> formed seven tmhs and topologies similar to those of eukaryotic rhomboid rho- <dig> of drosophila . as in rho- <dig>  the rhomboid catalytic residues gxsx & h  were localized respectively, in tmh <dig> and tmh <dig> . in mycobacterial orthologs of rv <dig>  the two c-terminal histidine and asparagine  were localized in tmh <dig>  in contrast to eukaryotic rhomboid proteases which have these residues in tmh <dig>  <cit> . however, in our analyses, we found his <dig>  his <dig> and asn <dig> in tmh <dig> in rho- <dig>  similar to rv <dig> . despite the proteins being evolutionary diverse, other studies found the overall structure of tmhs of rhomboid proteases conserved, with eukaryotic rhomboid proteases containing seven tmhs while archaea and eubacteria contain six  <cit> . it is not clear whether these similarities infer evolutionary or functional significance; similar topologies with eukaryotic rhomboids could imply occurrence of a common bacterial universal progenitor for the eukaryotic rhomboids  <cit> . nevertheless, prokaryotic and eukaryotic integral transmembrane proteins can have similar architecture, with striking similarity in the amino acid frequency distribution in their tmhs  <cit> .

in contrast, the mycobacterial orthologs of rv <dig> formed either six or five tmhs, as observed in most bacterial and archaeal rhomboids  <cit> . the orthologs of pathogenic mycobacteria formed six tmhs, while those of non-pathogenic mycobacteria formed five . the gxsx and h catalytic residues were found respectively, either in tmh <dig> and tmh <dig>  or in tmh <dig> and tmh <dig> . the mycobacterial orthologs with six tmhs had the two c-terminal his and asn residues in tmh <dig>  as in the rv <dig> orthologs; however, in the orthologs with five tmhs, these residues were outside the tmhs . although his <dig>  his <dig> and asn <dig> are not essential for catalytic activity  <cit> , it is not clear whether their absence in tmhs can affect functionality. this seems unlikely in that functions have been ascribed to the catalytically inert eukaryotic irhoms lacking the minimum catalytic sites  <cit> . alternatively, the observed differences may imply functional divergence, with rhomboids of pathogenic mycobacteria being functionally different from those of non-pathogenic mycobacteria. indeed, rv <dig> was essential for the survival of the tubercle bacilli in macrophages  <cit> . nevertheless, experimental evidence will be necessary for validation of these assertions.

extra protein domains in mycobacterial rhomboids
mycobacterial rhomboids contained extra protein motifs, many of which were eukaryotic. the orthologs of rv <dig> contained diverse eukaryotic motifs, while the rv <dig> orthologs maintained a fairly constant number and type of motifs, either fungal cellulose binding domain or bacterial putative redox-active protein domains . it is difficult to account for the origin of eukaryotic motifs in mycobacterial rhomboids; nevertheless, extra protein motifs are common in eukaryotic rhomboids where their significance is also not known  <cit> . since eukaryotic rhomboids are presumed to have been acquired from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms  <cit> , the extra protein motifs may have originated from prokaryotic progenitors. mycobacterial rhomboids also contained n-signal peptides and eukaryotic subcellular localization target signals which were either mitochondrial or secretory , with scores higher than or comparable to those of rho- <dig> and parl. these observations further allude to a common ancestor for mycobacterial and eukaryotic active rhomboids  <cit> .

a novel nonsense mutation at the trp <dig> codon split the map rhomboid into two hypothetical proteins
the annotated rhomboid of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis  in the genome databases appeared truncated; map_2425c  was significantly shorter than mav_ <dig> of genetically related m. avium . upstream of map_2425c was map_2426c , similar to the amino-terminal portion of mav_ <dig>  while the former  was similar to the carboxyl-terminal portion of mav_ <dig> . map_2425c and map_2426c were separated by  <dig> bp that translate into three residues  and a stop codon tga, at nucleotide position  <dig>  which split the homolog into two orfs. because map and m. avium are genetically related, initially, we thought map2425c and map2426c are truncated portions  and should have been a whole rhomboid of map. thus, we aimed to determine the correct annotation for the map rhomboid. using mav_ <dig> specific primers, we pcr-amplified and sequenced homologs of map2425c and map2426c  from a cattle isolate of map ; the amplicon was similar to map2426c and map2425c . thus, we confirmed the annotations for map2425c  and map2426c . it was later revealed that a nonsense mutation at nucleotide positions 217- <dig> , substituted guanine at the wobble position for adenine, creating a stop codon . usually, nonsense mutations disrupt orfs resulting in truncated and non-functional proteins; however, this rare scenario resulted into two unique orfs of map, providing the first evidence of a split rhomboid, contrasting whole orthologs of genetically related species. although the significance of this is currently not known, cdna was amplified from both orfs, implying that both hypothetical proteins may be expressed .

what are the lengths of mtc rhomboids?
in genome databases, the lengths for annotated sequences of rhomboids from genetically related mycobacteria vary, and initially we thought this reflected strain diversity. for instance, lengths for rv <dig> orthologs of mtc species are either  <dig> or  <dig> residues, while rv <dig> orthologs from the same species are  <dig> residues. in contrast, mt <dig>  of m. tuberculosis cdc  <dig> is  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> residues shorter at the nh2-terminus. thus, we aimed to validate the sizes of rhomboids from related strains/species. genomic analyses at the rhomboid loci for the sequenced mtc genomes revealed that mtc rhomboid orthologs are 100% identical and are of equal length. rhomboids were pcr-amplified from mtc with common primer sets for each ortholog , and sequencing data confirmed that mtc rhomboid orthologs are identical and are of the same size . rhomboid sequences were deposited in genbank and accession numbers were assigned .

putative gene clusters for mycobacterial rhomboids
to determine putative functional coupling between mycobacterial rhomboids and other genes, genes in clusters formed by mycobacterial rhomboids at the kegg database  <cit>  were analyzed. the gene cluster formed by rv <dig> was conserved across the genus and extended to other actinobacteria such as norcardia and corynebacteria. this cluster included  <dig> genes  of which some are essential and others are required for the growth of m. tuberculosis in macrophages  <cit> , a necessary step during pathogenesis of the tubercle bacillus. conversely, the rv <dig> orthologs formed clusters reflecting the genetic relatedness of mycobacteria. thus, the orthologs from mtc species and m. marinum formed similar clusters consisting of  <dig> genes . these clusters also included essential genes and those required for survival of the tubercle bacillus in macrophage. however, mul_ <dig> of genetically related m. ulcerans was not included in the mtc/m. marinum cluster, and formed a unique cluster consisting of only  <dig> genes  with two genes upstream of the rhomboid . it is not certain whether this reflects functional divergence of mul_ <dig> from rv <dig>  in spite of evolutionary relatedness of m. ulcerans and mtc species.

the gene cluster of rv <dig> orthologs of m. vanbaalenii, m. gilvum and mycobacterium species jls, kms and mcs were also similar, and consisted of  <dig> genes , whose orthologs in mtc species are required for the growth of the tubercle bacillus in macrophages  <cit> . conversely, the cluster for mab_ <dig> of m. abscessus consisted of only three genes , shared with actinobacteria other than mycobacteria. many mtc orthologs in the gene clusters of mul_ <dig>  mjls_ <dig> and mab_ <dig> are required for the growth of the bacillus in macrophages, the implication of which requires further study. there was no gene cluster formed by msmeg_ <dig> of m. smegmatis. the essential genes in mycobacterial rhomboid gene clusters are described in additional file  <dig> 

transcription analysis
due to their ubiquity in eubacteria, we aimed to determine the expression of mycobacterial rhomboids in a preliminary fashion by screening for in vivo transcription. rt-  pcrs amplified rhomboid cdnas from mycobacterial mrna, indicating that both copies of mycobacterial rhomboids are transcribed, and possibly expressed .

functional insights
signal transduction and metabolite transport
since mycobacterial rhomboids contain rhomboid catalytic signatures, they may be functionally similar to aara and rho- <dig>  rescuing phenotypes associated with deletion of these genes in p. stuartii and d. melanogaster rhomboid mutants  <cit> . due to their diverse functions, rhomboids appear good candidates for investigation in studies elucidating inter/intra-species/kingdom signaling mechanisms  <cit> .

furthermore, glup  of b. subtilis is involved in sugar transport  <cit> , while aara activates the tata protein transporter in p. stuartii  <cit> . as such, the putative gene clusters for mycobacterial rhomboids contained putative metabolite transporters and transcriptional regulators. since genes in clusters for transport and signal transduction genes tend to have similar roles  <cit> , mycobacterial rhomboids may have such roles.

roles in pathogenesis?
in a trash analysis by rengarajan et al, rv <dig> was required for the survival of m. tuberculosis h37rv in macrophages  <cit> , a necessary step during the development of tb. the genome wide conservation of rv <dig> alludes to a possibly important protein. the pathogenesis of m. ulcerans,  is known and it culminates in skin ulcerations caused by the plasmid encoded polyketide toxin -mycolactone  <cit> . buruli ulcer contrasts with the tuberculous nature of lesions formed by many pathogenic mycobacteria, whose pathogenesis is not well understood and remains a vast field of study.

moonlighting properties?
it is possible to predict functional coupling between genes based on conservation of gene clusters among genomes  <cit> . since proteins encoded by conserved gene pairs appear to interact physically  <cit> , the evolutionary conservation of the rv <dig> genome arrangement might have functional implications. mur <dig> is a moonlighting protein  that exhibits both racemization and dna gyrase activities  <cit> . since rhomboids are known for diverse functions, the proximity of rv <dig> orthologs with a moonlighting protein makes them suspects for moonlighting properties.

CONCLUSIONS
mycobacterial rhomboids have different evolutionary history
the two mycobacterial rhomboids are phylogenetically distinct and could have been acquired independently. the mycobacterial orthologs of rv <dig>  appear to be under evolutionary pressure; hence they were lost in the mac species and m. leprae. these orthologs represent prokaryotic rhomboids whose progenitor may be the ancestor for eukaryotic rhomboids. the rv <dig>  mycobacterial orthologs appear more stable and are conserved nearly in all mycobacteria, possibly alluding to their importance in mycobacteria.

map2425c and map2426c provide the first evidence of a split rhomboid contrasting whole orthologs of genetically related species.

mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid proteases
mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid proteases, with the active site being stabilized by phe. although valuable insights to the roles of rhomboids are provided, the data herein only lays a foundation for future investigations for the roles of rhomboids in mycobacteria.
