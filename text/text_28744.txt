BACKGROUND
repair of damages in dna is an essential cellular process regulated by specialized molecular machinery. base excision repair  pathway  <cit>  for repair of small lesions is initiated by monofunctional dna glycosylases. these enzymes use a water molecule as a nucleophile to cleave the n-glycosidic bond between the target base and deoxyribose, releasing the damaged base and leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic  site  <cit> . the ber pathway for the removal of uracil , which arises in dna from deamination of cytosine  or incorporation of dutp during dna synthesis, is initiated by uracil-dna glycosylases   <cit> . udgs are divided in different families based on their substrate specificity  <cit> . members of family i-v share similar structure and motifs. family i udgs, which are also known as ungs, specifically excise uracil from single-stranded dna  and double-stranded dna  with the preference ssu > dsu:g > dsu:a  <cit> . ungs are ubiquitous enzymes that use highly conserved motifs for dna binding, uracil recognition and excision.

the reaction mechanism for ungs has been elucidated from a series of elegant structural studies in which wild-type and catalytically inactive mutant ungs were captured in the dna-bound form at various stages of action . for detection of uracil in dna, ungs use a ‘pinch-push-pull’ mechanism, which involves a multi-step base flipping process. in the first step, serine and proline residues in three different loops  lead to a slight bending of the dna through compression  of the backbone. in the second step, a conserved leucine residue of the ‘leu-intercalation loop’ penetrates into the minor groove and the dna becomes fully bent and kinked leading to flipping of the uracil base . the uracil nucleotide interacts with the ‘uracil recognition pocket’ where cleavage of the glycosidic bond takes place, and in the final step, the leucine residue is retracted . two catalytic residues, an aspartic acid and a histidine, are found invariant in all ungs .table  <dig> comparison of motifs for dna binding and catalysis

motifs as previously listed  <cit>  are updated based on structural superimposition using the new d4-dna complex structure



ungs of poxviruses are, however, exceptional and most diverse members of this family. the motifs used by these enzymes are fully conserved in all orthopoxviruses but differ significantly from their counterparts in other organisms  . more importantly, ungs of poxviruses assume a novel and essential role in viral replication and serve as an intrinsic component of the replication machinery. in the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia, ung  binds to another viral protein a <dig> to form the heterodimeric processivity factor. a <dig> also binds to the dna polymerase e <dig> and thereby tethers d <dig> to e <dig>  and assembles the heterotrimeric  core of the processive polymerase complex. in the absence of d <dig>  vaccinia e <dig> synthesizes only short  stretches of dna  <cit> . this essential role of d <dig> in supporting processive dna synthesis is not dependent on its catalytic  activity  <cit> .

crystal structures of d <dig> have been reported in the free form  and as a non-productive <dig> uracil complex . three dimensional structure of d <dig> retains the overall fold of ung proteins- a central 4-stranded parallel β-sheet with α-helices on both sides . there are two additional β-sheets in d <dig>  not seen in any other ung . although the ung-specific motifs are very different, the architecture of the uracil-binding pocket in d <dig> is remarkably similar to other ungs and five of the six residues forming the pocket are identical. these residues include the catalytic asp <dig> and his <dig>  which are appropriately positioned for binding uracil and cleavage of the glycosidic bond  <cit> . considering the unique properties of poxvirus ungs, it should be highly interesting to understand how these proteins adapt to utilizing the altered motifs for binding dna, and recognizing and excising uracil.fig.  <dig> structure of d <dig>  a. overall structure of d <dig>  cartoon diagram shows the three dimensional structure of d <dig>  the a and b subunits from the free-d <dig> structure  are displayed and labeled. c-terminal strand of the central β-sheet is colored green. additional β sheets seen in d <dig> structures are colored magenta; amino acid residues forming the strands are labeled. structural elements that are involved in homodimer interactions in different d <dig> structures are painted in blue, violet and green. b. comparison with human ung . cartoon drawing shows superimposition of the structure of substrate-free hung  in wheat color and d <dig>  in cyan. overall structural fold is very similar for both proteins. the n and c-terminal additional β sheets in d <dig> are colored dark. n and c-terminal ends of d <dig> are labeled. c. a <dig> binding on d <dig>  cartoon drawing shows the a <dig> binding site on d <dig> structure. structure of d <dig>  was superimposed on the d <dig> chain a of d4:a <dig> complex . a <dig> segment from 4od <dig> is shown in wheat color. amino acid residues arg <dig> and pro <dig> of d <dig> and trp <dig> and lys <dig> of a <dig> play important role in the binding. these residues are shown as stick models. n and c-terminus of a <dig> are labeled



all crystal structures of free-d <dig> and the structure of the uracil complex feature a characteristic dimeric packing. although specific protein-protein interactions between d <dig> subunits vary to some extent the dimer interface is very similar in these structures  <cit> . this homodimer interface is formed by residues located in the c-terminal β-strand of the central β-sheet in each subunit, a flexible loop/short helix  and a long helix  located near the c-terminus. the first site, which is located in a loop connecting the two c-terminal β-strands, represents one of the most flexible areas in the d <dig> structures . at high protein concentration d <dig> utilizes the same interface for dimerization in solution. however, when a <dig> is present, very specific interaction at this surface leads to the formation of a d4:a <dig> heterodimer   <cit> . cumulative structural and biochemical evidences indicate that in the processive dna polymerase complex, d <dig> remains catalytically active and possibly continuously scans and removes uracil from newly synthesized dna . details of d4’s ability to bind and scan dna, its enzymatic function and substrate specificity have been reported  <cit> . however, structural characterization of the dna-binding site on d <dig> is missing.

here, we report the first detailed view of d4-dna interactions from a crystal structure of d <dig> in complex with a non-specific undamaged dsdna. the structure of this complex for the first time reveals the dna-binding interactions by an ung from the poxvirus family. it also represents the first three-dimensional structure of a ung bound to a truly undamaged dsdna and provides a representative snapshot of the initial interaction between ung and dna. we also present a structural comparison of d <dig> and human ung  for which crystal structures are available in the dna-free state, in complex with uracil-containing dna and in complex with a dna containing an abasic site .

RESULTS
overall quality of the d4-dna complex structure
the d4-dna structure was refined to  <dig>  Å resolution with rcryst and rfree values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. the overall quality of the structural model is good as indicated by molprobity scores  <cit>  and map correlation coefficients . the final model consists of two d <dig> subunits , a dna double helix with  <dig> nucleotides in chain c and  <dig> in chain d,  <dig> glycerol  molecules of which one is in each active site and  <dig> solvent atoms. glycerol molecules have been previously observed in the active site of d <dig>  and e. coli ung . quality of electron density for residues 184– <dig> of the ‘leu-intercalation’ loop was poor. therefore, these five residues were not modeled. as a result, the discussion of the ‘leu-intercalation’ loop for this structure is limited to interactions of loop residues 180– <dig>  also, side chain atoms of residues  <dig> and  <dig>  are not included in the final model due to lack of electron density. these residues are located in a flexible area in crystal structures of d <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> data collection and refinement statistics for 4qcb

in chain c all  <dig> nucleotides were modeled but only  <dig> could be modeled in chain d due to insufficient electron density. of the  <dig> base pairs forming the dna double helix,  <dig> show regular watson-crick  base pairing interactions and one non-wc interaction . in general electron density for the dna is good for the central regions  that interact with protein residues as indicated by map correlation coefficients  and temperature factors . the overall quality of the electron density for the dna double helix is displayed in additional file 1: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> structure of d4:dna complex. a. schematic diagram of the d4-dna interactions. bases are represented by one-letter codes  and base pairs are connected by a solid black line . the dna backbone is drawn next to the bases . dna strand  <dig>  runs from top  to bottom while the complementary strand  <dig>  runs in the opposite direction. base numbers as in the pdb coordinate file are written inside the sugars. interactions are plotted on either side of the strands; interacting protein residues are represented by their atom name , residue name and number . blue  lines represent hydrogen-bonded contacts . circles  labeled ‘w’ indicate water-mediated interactions with dna. water molecules are labeled by their pdb number. protein interactions of subunits a and b with dna strands c and d are highlighted as boxes and labeled. nucplot   <cit>  was used to generate the figure. b. dna binding site in d4:dna complex. cartoon diagram illustrating the d <dig> chains a and b in light pink and light cyan and the corresponding dna chains in pink  and bluish green  respectively. location of the partially disordered ‘leu-intercalation loop’ is labeled as leu-loop and indicated with dotted lines. c. molecular surface for d4:dna complex. molecular surface of the two d <dig> subunits is shown with the overlaid electrostatic potential contoured from negative  to positive  . the dna helix is displayed as cartoon drawing . this figure was generated using ucsf chimera   <cit>

as expected the dna represents a b-form right-handed double helix. puckering of the sugar ring for several nucleotides differs from the predominant c2’-endo conformation seen in b-dna . similar deviations in sugar puckering conformation have been observed in various protein-dna complexes.

assembly of d4-dna complex

conformations of the two d <dig> chains in the complex are also very similar with an rmsd value of  <dig>  Å for superposition of all  <dig> residues in a and b. each d <dig> chain binds only to one dna strand. d <dig> chain a binds to dna strand d and d <dig> chain b binds to dna strand c . the electrostatic potential distribution shown in fig. 2c illustrates the charge complementarity of the dna binding surface of d <dig> and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the dna strands.

d <dig> chain b interacts with nucleotides 5– <dig>  in the central part of chain c while d <dig> chain a interacts with nucleotides 23– <dig>  of chain d. d <dig> residues at the protein-dna interface are ile <dig>  pro <dig>  gly <dig>  glu <dig>  thr <dig>  lys <dig>  gly <dig>  lys <dig>  thr <dig>  asp <dig>  tyr <dig>  his <dig> and ala <dig> . polar protein-dna interactions with the phosphate backbone involve hydrogen-bonds  with lys <dig>  lys <dig>  thr <dig>  tyr <dig> and his <dig> from each d <dig> chain . dna binding residues in the two d <dig> chains superimpose very well .

distortion in the dna chains c and d such as bending and kinking are small compared to those observed in complexes of hung with specific uracil-containing dna . the length of the dna  is comparable to the value of 39–41 Å expected for an ideal extended b-form dna; the widths of the major and minor groove are also similar to those for ideal b-form dna.

incidentally, the dna double helix extends in the unit cell through non-covalent interactions between the ends of the dna helices generated by the space group symmetry in a head-to-tail fashion . similar extended packing through dna-dna contacts of dsdna with sticky or blunt ends  has been observed in other protein-dna structures  <cit> . on the other hand this arrangement of dna chains may be a result of crystal packing.

both protein-dna interfaces in the complex have similar interface areas and interface residues . interactions between the two d <dig> chains in the complex are minimal and confined to residues glu <dig>  val <dig>  ser <dig>  trp <dig>  arg <dig>  ser <dig>  ile <dig>  try <dig> and lys <dig>  there is a salt bridge between residues glu <dig> and arg <dig> and a stacking interaction between trp <dig> of two subunits.

conformational changes induced by dna binding
upon formation of productive dna complexes, ungs undergo an ‘open to close’ conformational transition . such a conformational transition is not expected in the present complex since the dna in the complex does not contain uracil. d <dig> residues involved in binding dna are localized in three structural areas: the extended dna-binding loop , the gly-ser loop  and the leu-intercalation loop . these three regions are labeled in fig.  <dig>  involvement of these sites in dna-binding and the resulting structural changes in the protein are discussed below. largest deviations in the dna complex are noticed in the extended helix/loop segment  joining the two c-terminal strands of the central β-sheet, and in the leu-intercalation loop . these two regions show varying degrees of disorder in d <dig> structures and portions of these areas are missing from several final models. therefore, we examined the electron density maps for d <dig> structures especially focusing on these areas. in the following discussion we used reference free-d <dig> structures in which completeness of the model in relevant regions of the protein was good and supported by electron density. we also used the structure of the d4:uracil complex  for comparison  <cit> . this structure contains  <dig> molecules in the asymmetric unit and the s <dig> and s <dig> sites could be modeled in  <dig> fig.  <dig> d4:dna interactions. comparison of the structures of d <dig> in free and dna-bound states. ribbon diagram showing superimposition of d <dig> subunits a and b  on d <dig> in the free form in yellow . the dna is shown as cartoon  as bound to the a subunit in the complex. areas important for dna-interactions are highlighted on 4dof chains in magenta , red  and rose . the leu-intercalation loop is on 4dof. arg <dig> which replaces the conserved leucine residue is shown in stick model. the helix loop segment that shows large deviation  is colored in violet. this region is critical for binding of a <dig> by d <dig>  residues arg <dig> and pro <dig> which play an important role in binding of a <dig> are shown as stick models and labeled



extended dna binding loop 
in the dna complex the side chain amino group of lys <dig> of each d <dig> subunit forms a strong hydrogen bond  with a phosphate oxygen atom of the partner dna strand. however, there is no movement in this region of d <dig> upon dna binding. main chain and side chain atoms of lys <dig> and neighboring residues superimpose very well with corresponding atoms in free-d <dig> structures 4dof, 4dog and 4lzb. in all structures the lys <dig> side chain extends towards the spatially close gly-ser loop and engages in hydrogen bonding with the carboxyl oxygen atoms of asp <dig>  as a result, the extended dna-binding loop tilts slightly towards the gly-ser loop . quality of electron density for lys <dig>  asp <dig> and areas adjacent to these residues is usually very good in these crystal structures . in a previously published study, the lys131val mutant was found to be defective in processivity function  <cit> . since this mutant did not show glycosylase activity it was assumed to have a major conformational defect  <cit> . both lys <dig> and asp <dig> are strictly conserved in ungs of the orthopoxviruses  <cit>  and thus may play an important role in specialized functions of these viral ungs, such as a component of the processivity factor. since neither of these residues is conserved in other ungs they are less likely to play any direct role in catalysis. on the other hand interactions of lys <dig> with asp <dig> on the spatially adjacent helix/loop may be important for the stability of the local structure. therefore the loss of glycosylase activity in the valine mutant may be due to structural impairment. at the same time, d <dig> surface near asp <dig> is critical for its interactions with a <dig>  <cit>  and therefore, structural changes due to the loss of interactions between lys <dig> and asp <dig> may affect the processivity function.fig.  <dig> protein-dna interactions at the extended dna-binding site. a and b shown in left and right panel are hydrogen bonding interactions  involving d <dig> chains a and b, respectively. relevant d <dig> residues are shown in stick models and are labeled. dna chains are shown as lines. hydrogen bonding distances shown are in a. interaction of lys <dig> side chain nz atom with asp <dig> carboxyl group may be important for local conformational stability. electron density for this region of dna complex is shown in additional file 1: figure s4



in a study combining h/d exchange mass spectroscopy and computational docking roberts et al.  <cit>  identified two extended non-sequence-specific dna-binding surfaces in hung  that did not show contacts with dna in the crystal structures. in d <dig> the corresponding regions are residues 126– <dig> and 165– <dig>  the latter segment in d <dig> is engaged in homodimer formation in the absence of a <dig> and in heterodimer formation in the presence of a <dig>  <cit> . thus this  may not represent a potential dna-binding site in d <dig> 

gly-ser loop 
the s <dig> site encompasses the gly-ser loop. this region shows varying degrees of flexibility in different d <dig> structures but could be modeled in both subunits in the dna complex. quality of electron density in this area of d <dig> was sufficient for unambiguously placing main chain and side chain atoms of all residues. for comparison of this site we selected the free-d <dig> structure 4dof  and the d4:uracil complex . comparison of the s <dig> site in the dna-complex with free-d <dig> structures reveals a slight reorganization in this area of the molecule . two amino acid residues, lys <dig> and thr <dig>  are involved in hydrophilic interactions with the dna. main chain nitrogen atom of lys <dig> interacts with two oxygen atoms on one phosphate group . thr <dig> hydroxyl oxygen atom is hydrogen bonded to one of the oxygen atoms of the same phosphate also through the peptide nitrogen atom. notably, lys <dig> and thr <dig> are unique residues in poxvirus ungs and are replaced by glycine and serine respectively in both e. coli and human enzymes. we showed that d <dig> mutant lys160val was deficient in processivity function but retained catalytic activity and dna binding ability  <cit> . in all d <dig> structures, side chain of lys <dig> extends toward the neighboring β-strand and its nz atom forms a hydrogen bond with the peptide oxygen atom of val <dig> on this strand. loss of this contact in the lys160val mutant may impact the structure of this area of d <dig>  notably, a hydrophobic pocket at this site has been shown to be important for d4’s interaction with a <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> protein-dna interactions at the gly-ser loop. hydrogen bonding interactions between the d <dig> residues in a and b subunits with partner dna strands are shown in left and right panel. relevant d <dig> residues are shown in stick models and are labeled. dna chains are shown as lines. hydrogen bonding distances shown are in Å. also nz atom of lys <dig> forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the peptide oxygen atom of val <dig> located on the c-terminal strand of the central β-sheet



leu-intercalation loop 
the s <dig> area, which includes the ‘leu-intercalation loop’, is important for the catalytic mechanism. electron density for this segment of d <dig> structure in 4dog and 3 nt <dig> was good  <cit> . in the dna-complex quality of electron density for this loop was inadequate for modeling the entire loop. therefore, residues 184– <dig> were omitted from the final model. two amino acid residues immediately preceding the disordered region of d <dig>  namely tyr <dig> and his <dig>  directly interact with dna. side chain hydroxyl group of tyr <dig> and the main chain nitrogen atom of his <dig> form contact with oxygen atoms of two phosphate groups from the dna . tyr <dig> is conserved in ungs of poxviruses but not in other ungs. his <dig> is a critical catalytic residue and is conserved in ungs across the species. in 4zlb we noticed some deviations in the position of his <dig> in different subunits. generally, in a productive uracil complex, the distance between the ne <dig> atom of histidine and the o <dig> atom of uracil is significantly shorter than in non-productive complexes . in 4lzb, the distance between o <dig> atom of uracil and his <dig> ne <dig> atom varied from  <dig> - <dig>  Å in different subunits  <cit> . in the dna complex his <dig> side chain moved farther away from the active site area. the missing segment includes arg <dig>  which is equivalent to the conserved leucine residue  of the leu-intercalation loop. in the mutational analysis mentioned above d <dig> arg187val mutant was also shown to be unable to support processive dna synthesis but retained binding to a <dig> and dna  <cit> . unfortunately, due to disorder in this loop detailed comparison of this functionally significant region is not possible from the present structure.fig.  <dig> protein-dna interactions at the leu-intercalation loop. cartoon and stick drawing displaying hydrogen bonding interactions at the leu-intercalation loop region between the d <dig> residues in a and b subunits with partner dna strands. relevant d <dig> residues are shown in stick models and are labeled. dna chains are shown as lines. hydrogen bonding distances shown are in Å. residues 184– <dig> were missing from both subunits



movement of arg <dig> and implications for a <dig> binding
most significant changes in the dna complex were noticed in residues arg <dig> and pro <dig> although neither of these residues is involved in direct interaction with dna. in 4dof and 4lzb, orientation of the arg <dig> side chain is stabilized by a strong hydrogen bond between its nh <dig> atom and the main oxygen atom of thr <dig>  in both d <dig> subunits in the dna complex, arg <dig> side chain is directed away from thr <dig> . the arg <dig> side chain is oriented such that nitrogen atoms of the terminal amino groups form hydrogen bonds with the peptide oxygen atom of val <dig>  position of arg <dig> side chain is further stabilized by polar interactions of its amino groups with the hydroxyl oxygen atom of thr <dig> side chain on one side and the main chain oxygen atom of ser <dig> on the other .fig.  <dig> movement of arg <dig> in the d4:dna complex and a <dig> binding. a. arg <dig> side chain of d <dig> in the dna complex and in dna-free d <dig>  stereo diagram showing movement of arg <dig> and pro <dig> residues of d <dig> chains a and b in the dna complex  superimposed on d <dig> subunits in different subunits of the uracil complex  shown in various shades of yellow and green. arg <dig> and pro <dig> residues are shown in stick model. b. hydrogen bonding interactions of arg <dig> in the dna complex. close up view of the above region showing hydrogen bonding interactions of arg <dig> of the two d <dig> chains a and b of the dna complex in the left and right panel, respectively. c. orientations of arg <dig> and pro <dig> in the dna complex. cartoon drawing showing close up view of the a <dig> binding site on d <dig>  d <dig> subunits from free-d <dig> , and d <dig> subunits a and b from the dna complex  are superimposed on the d <dig> subunit of the d4:a <dig> complex . the a <dig> molecule in 4od <dig> is colored in wheat. trp <dig> and lys <dig> residues of a <dig> are shown in stick model . arg <dig> residues of d <dig> chains are also shown in stick models and carbon atoms of each stick model are colored according to the chain. orientations of arg <dig> and pro <dig> of the d <dig> subunits in the dna complex are unfavorable for binding of a <dig> in the groove



in the crystal structure of the d4:a <dig> complex, the aromatic side chain of trp <dig> of a <dig> occupies a hydrophobic pocket referred to as groove by contesto-richefeu et al.  <cit>  and inserts into the space between pro <dig> and arg <dig> side chain. movement of arg <dig> side chain and pro <dig> in the a <dig> complex  favors this interaction. on the other hand in the dna-complex, orientation of arg <dig> side chain would interfere with binding of a <dig> at this site. interestingly, movement of pro <dig> in the dna-complex also seems to create an unfavorable steric environment for binding of a <dig>  while in the d4:a <dig> complex, pro <dig> of d <dig> moves in a direction that allowed packing of lys <dig> side chain of a <dig>  in the dna complex the carbonyl oxygen pro <dig> would be in close contact  with the cb atom of lys <dig> of a <dig> . thus the structure of the present dna complex suggests that dna binding induces conformational changes in d <dig> that may interfere with its binding to a <dig>  while d <dig> can independently bind both dna and a <dig>  perhaps in the formation of the heterotrimeric complex, d4-a20-interaction precedes the dna-binding event.

comparison of hung and d4
crystal structures of hung have been reported in the free-enzyme form  and in complex with damaged dna containing uracil . structure of mutant hung in which the leucine residue  of the leu-intercalation loop was altered to alanine was described in complex with dna containing an abasic site . superimposition and comparison of the structure of hung with d <dig> in their dna complexes demonstrate the divergences and general overlap in the areas important for dna binding and ung catalytic mechanism. the three dna binding sites described above are shown in fig.  <dig>  structural comparison of hung in the free-state and in complex with different dna constructs demonstrated that major conformational changes in ungs are promoted by the steps involved in generating and stabilizing the flipped out nucleotide upon recognition of uracil  <cit> . upon binding an undamaged dna, these conformational changes are not expected in d <dig>  superimposition of the structure of the d4:dna complex and the dna complex of hung  reveals that the gly-ser loop and the leu-intercalation loop provide the main interactions with dna. part of the leu-intercalation loop is disordered in the d4:dna complex. in hung, the catalytic histidine  clearly moves slightly closer towards the uracil binding pocket as compared to the d4:dna complex. it should be noted that in dna-free state this histidine residue superimposes well in d <dig> and hung . the interactions between the dna and d <dig> at the extended dna-binding site may be facilitated because of the larger size of the bound dna as compared to hung:dna complexes.fig.  <dig> comparison of d4:dna complex with hung:dna complex. a. overall comparison. structure of the a subunit of the d4:dna complex  is superimposed on the structure of hung:dna . dna chain from 1ssp is shown in cartoon drawing . uracil molecule cleaved and bound at the uracil binding pocket in hung is shown in stick model . his <dig> of d <dig> and the corresponding his <dig> of hung are shown in stick models. leu <dig> of the leu-intercalation loop  in hung is also shown in magenta sticks. dna-binding areas on d <dig> are colored darker: s <dig> site, residues 126– <dig>  s <dig> site residues 159– <dig> and s <dig> site residues 180– <dig>  the corresponding residue of leu <dig> in d <dig> is disordered. b. close up view  <dig>  close up view showing superimposition of d <dig> subunit a of d4:dna complex  on hung:dna complex structure . dna bound to hung is shown in cartoon . uracil molecule  in hung uracil binding pocket is shown as stick model . catalytic his <dig> of hung and the corresponding h <dig> of d <dig> are also shown in stick model. c. close up view  <dig>  cartoon diagram shows superimposition of the hung chain  from the dna complex 1ssp on the d <dig> chain a  of the d4:dna complex. dna shown in cartoon model is from the d4:dna complex . unless specified otherwise figures were generated using pymol   <cit> 



CONCLUSIONS
the d4-dna complex described here provides the structural framework for recognizing the dna binding residues and motifs in poxvirus ungs. the process of sequence-specific recognition and binding of dna includes non-specific interaction as an early or intermediate step . the structure with undamaged dsdna may represent a snapshot of an early dna-protein interaction in preparation for the recognition complex for ung  <cit> . it remains to be seen if the leu-intercalation loop transitions from its disordered state to an ordered state upon recognition of a damage in the dna. some of the unique structural features of d <dig> have evolved for undertaking its novel role in viral replication. structure presented here provides potential understanding of dna-binding by d <dig> in the poxvirus replication machinery.
