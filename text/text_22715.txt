BACKGROUND
common bean  is one of the most important crops worldwide and plays important roles in resolving food shortages in africa and adjusting diet structure in developed countries. however, the growth and productivity of common bean are severely affected by abiotic stress, particularly drought stress. drought affects large areas of common bean in china by causing plant death or reducing production. preventing loss over the next few decades is already a challenge in china, particularly in the provinces of xinjiang and shanxi. thus, it is very important to identify drought-associated genes in the common bean germplasm.

transcription factors  are pivotal regulators involved in the response to abiotic stresses such as drought, salt, and cold . a total of  <dig>  tfs belonging to  <dig> different families from  <dig> species have been identified in the plant tf database   <cit> . the tf family includes ap <dig> , arf , and c3h , among others. the largest tf family is the bhlh family, which comprises  <dig>  tfs, followed by myb  and erf . the species in this database represent chlorophyta, bryophyta, lycopodiophyta, coniferopsida, basal magnoliophyta, monocot and eudicot. the genome of the monocot maize has the largest number of tfs,  <dig>  , which are classified into  <dig> families. approximately  <dig>  % of the genome of the eudicot glycine max encodes more than  <dig>  tfs  classified into  <dig> families  <cit> .

the nam, ataf1/ <dig> and cuc <dig>  genes are plant-specific tfs that constitute one of the largest families of plant transcription factors. nac family genes are characterized by a conserved nac domain at the n-terminus consisting of nearly  <dig> amino acid residues. the nac domain is divided into five subdomains , and the c-terminal regions of nac proteins are not conserved . planttfdb  contains  <dig>  nac genes from  <dig> species. the plant species with the most nac genes are populus trichocarpa , gossypium raimondii , malus domestica , glycine max , and eucalyptus grandis . by contrast,  <dig> plant species, including vigna unguiculata , brassica oleracea , and helianthus annuus , have fewer than  <dig> reported nac loci in planttfdb. interestingly, there are few tfs from food legumes in planttfdb. furthermore, nac proteins have recently been reported in algae, where they may play a role in the stress response  <cit> . in recent years, the whole genome sequences of several food legumes have been completed, including those of pigeonpea  <cit> , chickpea  <cit> , common bean  <cit> , mung bean  <cit> , and adzuki bean  <cit> . these genome sequences provide a wonderful opportunity for a comparative genome survey of new tfs from food legumes. in plants, nac genes regulate a variety of plant developmental processes, including floral morphogenesis  <cit> , root development  <cit> , leaf senescence  <cit> , stress-inducible flowering induction  <cit> , seed development  <cit>  and fiber development  <cit> . nac domain proteins have also been implicated in plant abiotic stresses and defense responses, such as salt  <cit> , wounding  <cit> , cold  <cit> , and particularly drought  <cit> . for example, anac <dig>  anac <dig>  anac <dig> and ataf <dig> regulate the expression of stress-responsive genes under drought stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . the wheat tanac <dig>  tanac <dig>  tanac <dig> and tanac <dig> genes respond to drought stress . similarly, transgenic rice overexpressing osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  and osnac <dig> exhibits enhanced resistance to drought stress . recently, the roles of a stress-related nac transcription factor  were reported in miscanthus lutarioriparius and in improved drought-tolerant transgenic cultivars  <cit> . although a large number of nac tfs have been functionally characterized in arabidopsis, wheat, rice, and other plants, the functions of the majority of nac members remain unknown in legumes. for common bean, a model legume species, there are very limited reports on the functional characterization of nac tfs. recently, chickpea carnac <dig> and carnac <dig> were reported as transcriptional activators involved in the drought stress response  <cit> . tran et al. analyzed  <dig> full-length nac genes from soybean and determined that nine were induced by drought  <cit> . gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> were identified in drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by genetic engineering  <cit> . however, there have been no reports about drought-tolerant related nac tfs from common bean.

in our study, we performed genome-wide identification of nac domain tfs in common bean and detailed analyses of the genome distribution, gene structure, conserved motifs and expression patterns under drought stress. our results provide a subset of potential candidate drought-tolerant related nac genes for future analyses of gene function in common bean.

RESULTS
identification of nac transcription factors in common bean
in this study, the hidden markov model  profile of the pfam nac domain  was used as a query to identify nac genes in the common bean genome . a total of  <dig> non-redundant putative nac genes were obtained, of which  <dig> full-length protein sequences were used for further analyses, such as gene structure and phylogenetic tree analyses. first, we analyzed the genome, cds and protein lengths; mw; pi; and subcellular localization of these nac genes . the genome length  of these nac genes ranged from 741 bp  to  <dig>  bp . the cds length ranged from 537 bp  to  <dig>  bp , protein length from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa , mw from  <dig>  kda  to  <dig>  kda  and pi from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . subcellular localization prediction indicated that  <dig> genes were located in the nucleus and  <dig> genes were potentially extracellular.

genome distribution of common bean genes
figure  <dig> shows that the  <dig> common bean nac genes are distributed across all  <dig> chromosomes ; however, in the most recently released sequences, phvul.l <dig> remained on as-of-yet unmapped scaffolds. the distributions of common bean nac genes across the chromosome appeared to be non-random . only two nac genes are distributed on ch <dig>  the lowest number of genes on a chromosome; on ch <dig>   <dig> nac genes were identified, the highest number of genes. a number of clusters of nac genes are evident on the chromosomes, particularly on those with high densities of nac genes. for example, nac-ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig>  were cluster localized on a 14-kb segment on ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig> , nac-ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig>  are in a cluster on 50-kb and 54-kb fragments of ch <dig>  respectively. however, nac-ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig>  are arranged in a cluster localized to a 67-kb segment on ch <dig> . in addition, nac-ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig>  are organized in another cluster within a 103-kb fragment on ch <dig>  whereas nac-ch <dig>  and nac-ch <dig>  are arranged in a cluster localized to a 110-kb segment on ch <dig> .fig.  <dig> chromosomal location of common bean nac genes. a total of  <dig> nac genes were mapped to the  <dig> chromosomes , whereas the nac-sc gene was located on unassembled scaffold_ <dig>  the arrows represent the direction of transcription. the position of each gene can be estimated using the scale on the left




putative promoter region analysis of the nac gene family
tfs bind to the dna on specific cis-acting regulatory elements , which determine the initiation of transcription and are among the most important gene structures  <cit> . cares are short conserved motifs of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides usually found within the 1500 bp upstream of genes, known as the promoter region  <cit> . to further investigate transcriptional regulation and the potential functions of nac subfamily genes in common bean, the promoter regions of the nac genes  were analyzed using the plantcare database to identify putative cares. a total of  <dig> similar cares associated with developmental processes, light responsiveness, biotic stress, hormones and other functions were identified in the promoter regions of these nac genes . all promoters of common bean nac genes were predicted to contain an essential element, such as a tata box and a caat box. of these cares, several cis-elements related to tissue-specific expression, such as root-specific , seed-specific , endosperm-specific , and meristem-specific  cis-elements, were present in nac gene promoters. we also observed numerous light-responsive cis-elements widely distributed in the promoter regions of nacs in common bean, such as as- <dig> box, ae-box, g-box, and gag-motif. cares involved in plant hormones, such as gibberellin-responsive elements , an ethylene-responsive element , auxin-responsive elements , meja-responsive elements  and aba-responsive elements , were also identified. in particular, important elements in abiotic stress, including heat stress-responsive element , drought-responsive element , wound-responsive element , low-temperature element , cold and dehydration-responsive element  and defense and stress-responsive element  were detected. these results clearly suggest that nac tfs might respond to abiotic stresses and have potential functions in enhancing abiotic stress resistance. for instance, phvul.004g <dig> and phvul.005g <dig> had up to five types of abiotic stress cares. furthermore, hse, mbs, wun-motif, ltr and tc-rich repeats were identified in phvul.004g <dig>  hse, mbs, wun-motif, c-repeat/dre and tc-rich repeats were identified in phvul.005g <dig>  in addition, phvul.001g <dig>  phvul.002g <dig>  phvul.004g <dig>  phvul.005g <dig>  phvul.007g <dig>  phvul.008g <dig>  phvul.009g <dig> and phvul.009g <dig> had four types of abiotic stress cares.

phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs and gene structure analysis of the nac gene
to determine the phylogenetic relationships between nac genes in common bean, an unrooted phylogenetic tree with  <dig> complete nac protein sequences was constructed . the phylogenetic tree revealed that nac family proteins can be classified into eight major groups: i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii and viii , consistent with previous reports  <cit> . group i is the largest clade, with  <dig> members, and accounts for  <dig>  % of all nac tfs, and groups ii and iv contain the same number of members . group vii contains only one member, phvul.001g <dig>  and groups i, ii, iii and iv each contain two subgroups.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and motif composition of nac genes in common bean. a the phylogenetic tree of nac genes from common bean was constructed in mega <dig>  using the neighbor-joining  method with  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. b the conserved motifs of common bean nac genes were elucidated by meme. the conserved motifs are represented by the different colored boxes. the black lines represent the non-conserved sequences. c exon/intron structures of nac genes from common bean. exons and introns are represented by green boxes and black lines, respectively. the sizes of exons and introns can be estimated using the scale below



the n-termini of nac tfs contain five subdomains   <cit> . thus, we analyzed the conserved motifs of nac tfs from common bean using the meme program  <cit>  . the motif distribution analyses of the nac proteins revealed that  <dig> of  <dig>  common bean nac proteins contain all five domains, domains a, b, c, d and e . nine  nac proteins lack one domain ; nine  nac proteins lack domains b and c; eleven  nac proteins lack b and d; and only one protein, phvul.008 g <dig>  lacks three domains . all common bean nac domains  contain motif e, the most highly conserved motif in common bean nacs. domain a is also relatively highly conserved; only phvul.002g <dig> and phvul.008 g <dig> lack motif a. however, motif b is the least conserved motif in common bean nacs. for instance, all members of groups i and iii contain all five motifs , whereas the members of group viii  contain motifs a, d and e. by contrast, the conserved motif appears to be more variable in groups ii, iv, v and vi.fig.  <dig> the conserved motifs of common bean nac genes. the bit score indicates the information content for each position in the sequence



to analyze the structural diversity of nac genes, we compared the exon/intron organization in the coding sequences of individual nac genes in common bean using gsds  <dig> . the detailed gene structures are shown in fig. 2c. based on the results of gene structure prediction, the number of introns ranges from one to five in the common bean nac gene family. among these nac genes, most nac genes have two introns, whereas two members have one intron. overall, genes with highly similar gene structures were clustered in the same phylogenetic group of common bean nac genes.

expression pattern of nac tfs in common bean
the coding sequences of all nac domains of common bean were used to search the expression database using phytozome. expression data are not available for phvul.l <dig> , and the expression profiles of  <dig> nac genes in  <dig> common bean tissues, including young trifoliates, leaves, flower buds, flowers, green mature pods, young pods, roots, stems, and nodules, were obtained. no tissue expressed all  <dig> nac genes , but the majority of the tfs coexisted in all tissues . nac tfs were expressed in some tissues but not others. nac tfs were most abundant in nodules , followed by young pods and roots , flowers , and stems . few nac tfs were expressed in the leaves . we constructed an expression profile heat map based on expression data in different organs of nac tfs . all nac tfs with expression profiles were clustered into  <dig> groups based on their expression patterns. moreover, five nac tfs  were highly expressed in all common bean organs. no gene was specifically expressed in only one tissue. phvul.002g <dig> was specifically expressed in nodules and roots, whereas phvul.005g <dig> was specifically expressed in nodules and green mature pods. the other nac genes were expressed in at least three tissues.fig.  <dig> heat map of expression profiles for nac genes across different tissues. the expression data were generated from the phytozome database and viewed in mev software. hierarchical clustering was performed for the transcript ratios from all conditions. the color scale shown below represents expression values, with green indicating low levels and red indicating high levels of transcript abundance



expression profiles of nac tfs under drought stresses
numerous nac domain proteins have been implicated in plant drought stress . to determine the expression profiles of nac tfs under drought stress,  <dig> nac genes were analyzed using transcriptome and qrt-pcr data. the transcriptome data obtained from our previous report described the expression profiling of the genotypes long 22- <dig>  and naihua  in response to drought stress  <cit> .

we detected  <dig> differentially expressed nac genes  between samples loi and ltd and  <dig> genes between noi and ntd. in this study, ‘up-regulated’ and ‘down-regulated’ were denoted in accordance with the results from a previous study . between samples loi and ltd, more dens were up-regulated  than down-regulated . similarly, more dens were up-regulated  than down-regulated  between noi and ntd. among these dens, eleven nac genes shared a common expression pattern in long 22- <dig> or naihua under drought stress. two genes  were up- or down-regulated under drought stress only in the drought-tolerant genotype, whereas five genes were differentially expressed under drought stress only in the drought-sensitive genotype. in addition, four genes  exhibited differential expression under drought stress between different cultivars . however, phvul.002g <dig> and phvul004g <dig> were also differentially expressed under drought stress in the drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant genotypes, respectively. all candidate dens obtained by rna-seq analysis were further validated by rt-pcr . the expression profiles of  <dig> candidates, excluding phvul.008g <dig> and phvul.009g <dig>  were generally in agreement with the predictions from the rna-seq results . these results suggest that these dens are related to drought stress.table  <dig> selected differentially expressed nac proteins between different treatment and cultivars

in general, orthologous genes of different plants usually have similar functions  <cit> . thus, common bean nac genes may have functions similar to those of genes in the same subgroup with known functions. we built a phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of nac proteins from common bean and known drought-related nac proteins from other species, including rice, arabidopsis, soybean, chickpea, and wheat . a total of  <dig> dens belonged to different subgroups including drought-related nac genes. these results indicate that orthologs such as phvul.009g <dig>  phvul.005g  <dig> and other dens may have similar functions and that these dens may be associated with drought stress. however, we also observed that phvul.005g <dig> and phvul.004g <dig> belonged to the same subgroup without any known-function nac genes. furthermore, mbs is a cis-acting regulatory element that is predicted to serve as an myb binding site involved in drought inducibility. tsapx <dig>  is involved in the response to drought stress and contains an mbs element in its promoter  <cit> . among these related nac genes of common bean,  <dig> genes contain mbs cis-elements . these results support the involvement of these nac genes in drought resistance. we also compared the cis-acting regulatory elements and the promoters of dens and orthologues from different plants  . among these cares, in addition to essential elements and enhancers, we found  <dig> conservative cares  in drought-responsive genes . among these cares, mbs involves in drought inducibility, and cgtca and tgacg involve in meja responsiveness. these conservative cares maybe play an important role in regulating drought resistance.

discussion
common bean is a food legume. the seeds of common bean are an important food source, and common bean plants also contribute to soil fertility. whole-genome sequences of many food legumes, including pigeonpea  <cit> , chickpea  <cit> , mung bean  <cit> , and adzuki bean  <cit> , have recently been released. the genome of common bean was completed with two p. vulgaris accessions: an andean genotype  and a mesoamerican genotype   <cit> . these sequence data provide rich resources for comparative genomic analyses and genome and gene evolution studies. the nac protein family is one of the largest families of tfs and is involved in plant development and response to abiotic and biotic stresses. nac proteins have been studied in many plants, including maize, soybean, oryza sativa, arabidopsis thaliana, and opulous trichocarpa , but this study is the first to identify and characterize nac proteins encoded in the common bean genome.

in this study, we analyzed  <dig> non-redundant nac genes from common bean, fewer nac genes than in other grasses, for example,  <dig> in populus  <cit> ,  <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> ,  <dig> in rice  <cit> , and  <dig> in soybean  <cit> . we also analyzed the gene structures and conserved motifs of the nac tfs. the common bean nac genes contained one to five introns. the exon/intron numbers of common bean nac genes differ from those of other plants, such as populus, which has a range of zero to eight. however, the number of conserved motifs in common bean nac genes was similar to that of other species, including populus, rice, soybean and arabidopsis. however, the diversity of gene structures and conserved motifs may also indicate that common bean nacs are functionally diversified, with roles in shoot apical meristem development, floral morphogenesis, lateral root development, leaf senescence, embryo development, cell cycle control, hormone signaling, abiotic stresses and defense responses. in general, proteins with similar sequences have similar functions, and we therefore analyzed the functions of common bean nac tfs based on the phylogenetic tree of nac proteins. phvul.005g <dig> and phvul.011g <dig> may be involved in shoot apical meristem formation and development because they clustered into one subgroup with cuc <dig> and cuc <dig>  <cit> . moreover, ataf <dig>  ataf <dig>  phvul.009g <dig>  phvul.001g <dig>  phvul.002g <dig>  phvul.009g <dig> and phvul.009g <dig> clustered into one group and may be involved in wounding  <cit> . phvul.007g <dig> and vnd  <dig> clustered into one subgroup and have been proposed as regulators of vascular vessel formation  <cit> . some genes may participate in responses to abiotic stress, such as phvul.011g <dig>  gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig>  anac <dig>  anac <dig> and anac <dig> under salt stress  <cit> . some genes  have been reported to be mostly involved in heat response  <cit>  but may have more functions; for example, phvul.001g <dig>  phvul.009g <dig> and osnac <dig> are involved in the response to abiotic stresses, such as high salinity, aba treatment and cold  <cit> . the functions of many nac family genes remain unknown. future studies will focus on discovering novel functions of nac genes, particularly of genes specific to common bean.

in this paper, we focused on the function of nac genes under drought stress. in the present study, we identified  <dig> common bean nac tfs that were induced by drought stresses based on transcriptome data; these genes were of two types: differentially expressed between drought-tolerant/sensitive genotypes and differentially expressed between treatment/control. furthermore, quantitative real-time pcr demonstrated that the expression profiles of the  <dig> candidates were generally in agreement with the predictions from the rna-seq results, indicating that these genes are functionally associated with the drought-stress response. in addition, the phylogenetic tree of common bean nac genes and known-function nac genes from other species also suggested that these  <dig> nac genes may be related to drought stress. for example, one group included five common bean nac genes and  <dig> known-function nac genes that are all induced by drought stress . the members of this subfamily are also the most widely studied and play important roles in the nac family. another group included five common bean nac genes and carnac <dig> from chickpea  <cit> , msnac from medicago sativa  <cit> , stnac <dig> from potato  <cit> , zmnac <dig> from maize  <cit> , anac <dig> and anac <dig> from arabidopsis  <cit>  and osnac <dig> from rice  <cit> , all of which are induced by drought. phvul.005g <dig> and phvul.004g <dig> belong to a group without any drought-related nac proteins. these results suggest that phvul.005g <dig> and phvul.004g <dig> may be a new class of nac tfs that are not involved in drought resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
we comprehensively identified nac genes in common bean based on the genome sequence. this study identified a non-redundant set of  <dig> nac genes in common bean. detailed analyses identified phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs, gene structure and expression profiles of common bean nac genes. our research provides useful information for further research on the function of nac in common bean and will accelerate functional genomics studies and molecular breeding programs. moreover, the candidate drought-responsive nac genes identified in common bean will provide a new resource for molecular breeding in food legumes and other crops.
