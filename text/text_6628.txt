BACKGROUND
canine mast cell tumours  are currently treated with one or a combination of four different therapeutic approaches: surgical, radiation, classical chemotherapy and the recently introduced tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
 <cit> . the latter mainly act by inhibiting the stem cell factor receptor kit, the activation of which is one of the most important proliferation stimuli of normal and neoplastic mast cells
 <cit> .

kit is constitutively expressed on normal and neoplastic canine mast cells
 <cit> . due to its central role in mast cell biology and carcinogenesis a special research focus has been placed on the understanding of kit for canine mct development, malignant progression and treatment in recent years. several kit mutations have been identified, which are associated with aberrant kit signalling and thus seems to be a major carcinogenic factor for a subset of canine mast cells
 <cit> . for instance, tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane subunit of kit have been identified in up to 12% of all canine mct and 40% of malignant grade iii mct
 <cit> . this mutation results in a constitutively activated kit tyrosine kinase and leads to increased malignant behaviour in most affected tumours
 <cit> . as a consequence tki have been introduced for mct treatment
 <cit> . the action of tki is not restricted to the tyrosine kinase subunit of kit but other tyrosine kinases are also inhibited
 <cit> . nevertheless, the activity of non-kit tyrosine kinases appear much lesser relevant for canine mast cell proliferation and the principle of tki action in canine mct is thus thought to mostly rely on kit inhibition
 <cit> .

masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets kit, the platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β  and the src family kinases
 <cit> . masitinib has been successfully used in the treatment of canine mct
 <cit> . in addition to its direct effects on mct by kit inhibition, in vitro and in vivo, pilot studies indicate that masitinib also has a potential for chemosensitisation to classic chemotherapeutic agents including gemcitabine, vinblastine and doxorubicin
 <cit> .

despite these ongoing efforts in kit research in veterinary oncology, little is known on the downstream signal transduction pathways, target genes and cell functions associated with kit activity. the present explorative study therefore aimed at identifying the transcriptional and translational changes after treatment of neoplastic canine mast cells with the tki masitinib using transcriptome and proteome analysis.

RESULTS
cell proliferation, metabolism and death after masitinib treatment
treatment of c <dig> cells with  <dig> nm masitinib induced a complete growth arrest with stable cell counts during  <dig> hours of treatment. in contrast, cell numbers in untreated c <dig> cells constantly increased during the experiment with an almost 3-fold rise of cell counts after  <dig> hours.

a wst- <dig> assay was performed to assess mitochondrial function before exposure, and after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of masitinib exposure . there was an approximately 60% reduction in wst- <dig> conversion of masitinib treated cells at all indicated time points when compared to the initial activity of the untreated cells. a starting point analysis was chosen to reduce the influence of variable cell concentrations of treated and untreated cell cultures and the different metabolic activity during the different growth curve phases of untreated cells.

ldh-leakage assay identified a significant increase of  <dig> % after  <dig> hours but no changes after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, indicating only a reduced level of cell death and cytotoxicity at the masitinib concentration used .

changes in the transcriptome after masitinib treatment
treatment of c <dig> cells with masitinib  induced a massive change in their global gene expression pattern. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes had significant changes in their expression levels of >  <dig> -fold after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively . approximately 59% of these genes had decreased expression levels while the rest had increased expression. approximately one third of these genes code for nuclear proteins while 18–26% of the gene products are expressed in the cytoplasm and in cell organelles .

most nuclear factors were involved in mitosis and dna replication , which were mostly down-regulated after masitinib treatment. in addition, genes associated with stress response, glycolysis and the citrate cycle were significantly down-regulated .

an up-regulation of mrna expression levels was mostly observed for genes associated with golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes and genes associated with apoptosis and proteolysis . of note, a set of pro-apoptotic genes were significantly enriched in both, up-regulated and down-regulated, groups of genes.

pathway analysis identified a significant down-regulation of gene expression levels associated with p <dig>  steroid receptor and gtpase-associated signal transduction pathways. in contrast, there was a time dependent increase in the number of up-regulated genes associated with signal transduction pathways during masitinib treatment. after  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment there was a significant up-regulation of genes associated with three signal transduction pathways, i.e. t-cell receptor, insulin receptor and steroid hormone receptor. at  <dig> hours genes associated with five additional pathways were up-regulated, i.e. thyroid receptor, vitamin d receptor, ras cascade, il <dig> receptor and ige receptor. finally, at  <dig> hours up-regulation of genes associated with  <dig> signal transduction pathways were recorded, the aforementioned pathways and the signalling cascades of the b-cell receptor, map kinase, egf receptor, focal adhesion, cxcr <dig> receptor, epo signalling and pten signalling .

a correlation analysis of expression levels with the different timepoints identified  <dig> genes with a time dependent, continuous up-regulation in gene expression levels during masitinib treatment, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a , parathyroid hormone  and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule  <dig>  . david analysis identified a significant enrichment of the functional annotations apoptosis, atm-signalling pathway, ras protein signal transduction, aging, b-cell proliferation and unfolded protein response in this group of genes. a correlation analysis identified  <dig> genes that had a time dependent, continuous decrease in expression levels during masitinib treatment, including eif <dig> and eif <dig>  enriched functional annotations in this gene subset were butyrate and pyruvate metabolism, mitochondrial functions, cell migration, apoptosis and mitosis .

changes in the proteome after masitinib treatment
2d-dige and maldi-tof analyses of the proteome after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment identified  <dig> proteins with significant differences in protein expression levels when compared to the proteome before masitinib treatment . three proteins, tar-dna binding protein , eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>  and the actin related protein  <dig>  were down-regulated after  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment . only two proteins, annexin a <dig>  and the gelsolin-like capping protein  were up-regulated after  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment.

the effect of masitinib treatment on all five proteins was confirmed by comparing the proteome at  <dig> hours of treatment with the pre-treatment proteome. all five proteins were identified as significantly regulated at  <dig> hours and having an even increased expression level after  <dig> hours treatment . nineteen additional proteins had significant changes in expression levels after  <dig> hours treatment . proteins with the highest down-regulation were the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4a , t-complex protein  <dig> alpha  and the inorganic pyrophosphatase  <dig> . in addition to the two proteins with increased expression levels after  <dig> hours,  <dig> up-regulated proteins were identified after  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment. of these, iroquois homeobox  <dig> , selenium binding protein  <dig> , ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase l <dig>  and annexin a <dig>  had the highest up-regulation in protein expression levels.

comparison with the set of genes identified in the transcriptome analysis identified  <dig> gene products to be present in the list of mrna and proteins with significant changes in expression levels. mrna expressions from  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated proteins after masitinib treatment were also down-regulated. furthermore, mrna from  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins up-regulated in c <dig> treated cells was also present in the transcriptome analysis. however, only five of the transcripts were up-regulated whereas four were down-regulated, in contrast to the situation at the protein level.

discussion
the present study aimed at identifying the transcriptional and translational responses of kit-mutant canine mast cells after treatment with the tki masitinib. to this end, c <dig> cells, a cell line with a tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane unit and thus constitutively activated kit, were treated with masitinib and changes in the global mrna and protein expression levels were characterised. due to the strong dependency of neoplastic mast cell proliferation on the constitutively activated kit it was hypothesized that the observed effects may directly or indirectly be caused by the inhibition of kit
 <cit> .

treatment of c <dig> cells with masitinib resulted to a significant change in mrna expression levels of a substantial number of genes. more than  <dig>  genes had up-regulated mrna expression levels after  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment. this gene number corresponds to approximately 16% of the suspected  <dig>  genes in the canine genome
 <cit> . according to estimations in human cells, approximately  <dig>  genes or 16% of the complete coding genome is active in a given cell on average
 <cit> , indicating that almost the complete set of active genes in the c <dig> cells responds to masitinib treatment. this, however, is only a very rough estimation since the number of active genes may certainly be different in the analysed neoplastic mast cells.

the initial observation of reduced proliferation and metabolism of masitinib treated cells lead to the hypothesis that masitinib treatment and thus kit inhibition causes a severe shut off of gene activity in treated cells. the results of the transcriptome analysis however indicate that almost half of the regulated genes were transcriptionally up-regulated. relatively few of these genes had a time dependent up- or down-regulation after masitinib treatment as indicated by the analysis of a potential correlation of the changes in gene expression levels and increasing treatment times.

the active transcriptional response of c <dig> cells to masitinib treatment is in accordance with the observation that there was only a mild increase in ldh release and thus cell death in the medium of masitinib treated cells even after  <dig> hours. c <dig> cells therefore seem to actively respond to kit inhibition with an alternative quantitative and qualitative gene expression pattern to circumvent cell death. for instance,  <dig> receptor pathways were up-regulated after  <dig> hours of masitinib treatment, most of which have a potential pro-proliferative activity. it can thus be hypothesised that those pathways may contain potential targets for combination therapy.

a subsequent proteome analysis identified  <dig> proteins with significant changes in protein expression after  <dig> hours masitinib treatment. 65% of the proteins also had significant changes in the mrna expression levels. the total number of proteins is therefore surprisingly low when compared to the large number of transcripts affected. one of the reasons may be a delayed response of the proteome to the changes in the transcriptome and changes in mrna expression levels may therefore not be reflected after  <dig> hours
 <cit> . another point may be the complete metabolic shut off of treated cells which may also severely hamper the protein metabolism of the cells. mirna as potent regulators of mrna translation efficiency may also have influenced the differences in mrna and protein expression levels. on the other hand, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis is known to cover only a fraction of the complete proteome while hydrophobic proteins, e.g. membrane proteins and strongly acidic and basic proteins are difficult to separate and visualise by gel electrophoresis. in addition, the differences in the dynamic range of protein and mrna detection methods also significantly differ and influence the number and intensity of detected mrna and protein species
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, masitinib treatment of neoplastic mast cells leads to a massive change in the global mrna expression pattern while only few proteins had significant changes in expression levels after three days of treatment. in contrast to our initial hypothesis, a surprisingly high number of genes had an up-regulated expression, indicating cellular efforts to replace kit activity and circumvent growth arrest by activation of alternative pro-proliferative pathways. however, as is evident from the long-term follow-up study of masitinib treatment in dogs with non-resectable mct, development of such alternative pathways are by no means guaranteed
 <cit> . nonetheless, if present in vivo these pathways may contain potential candidates to be identified as targets for a combined therapy with masitinib to further improve the efficiency of mast cell therapy.
