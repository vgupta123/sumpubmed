BACKGROUND
cd <dig>  also named platelet and t cell antigen  <dig>  or dnax accessory molecule- <dig> , is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. the cd <dig> molecule is mainly expressed on nk cells, t cells, nk t cells, and platelets, and is involved in cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion of t cells and nk cells and in platelet aggregation and activation  <cit> . it is highly conserved among human, gibbon, monkey, and mouse, suggesting this molecule may have important biological functions  <cit> . recently, cd <dig> has been identified as a receptor for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> , and ligation of cd <dig> and leukocyte function-associated antigen- <dig>  with their respective ligands cooperates in triggering cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion by t and nk cells  <cit> .

recently, more attention has been paid to a putative role for cd <dig> in tumor development. the specific interaction between cd <dig>  and cd <dig> or cd <dig>  plays an important role in the nk-mediated lysis of tumor cells  <cit> . based on that, cd <dig> is thought to be one of the major activating nk receptors  <cit>  and involved in tumor immunosurveillance  <cit> . moreover, the abnormal expression of cd <dig> and its ligands in some tumors may be involved in the mechanisms of tumor escape, invasion, and migration  <cit> . although soluble cd <dig> has been detected in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid  <cit>  and is anticipated to be one of the mechanisms of tumor immune escape  <cit> , there has been no report on soluble cd <dig>  or the levels of membrane cd <dig>  and their relationship in tumors. here, based on the mabs and elisa system established by our laboratory  <cit> , we describe increased scd <dig> levels in sera and lower mcd <dig> expression on pbmc from cancer patients compared with those of normal subjects, and demonstrate the possible function and origin of the increased scd <dig>  these findings may provide useful information for understanding the mechanisms of tumor escape and for immunodiagnosis.

RESULTS
elevated scd <dig> levels in sera and reduced mcd <dig> expression on pbmc in cancer patients
using the sandwich elisa, we found that the concentration of scd <dig> was significantly higher in serum from cancer patients than in serum from normal subjects: the ranges of serum scd <dig> being  <dig> – <dig>  ng/ml in normal subjects and  <dig> – <dig>  ng/ml in cancer patients . this increase in serum scd <dig> was evident in most of the tumor types we tested except liver cancer , a finding consistent with the fact that all of the tumor types shown here have been identified to express cd <dig> and/or cd <dig>  <cit> . it is known that many membrane molecules can be shed from the cell surface and released into the circulation in soluble form in some pathological conditions such as tumor  <cit> . to investigate whether the increased scd <dig> in cancer patients might be shed from the cell surface, we examined the mcd <dig> on pbmc from both patients and normal subjects. accordingly, it was found that the expression of mcd <dig> by pbmc from cancer patients was lower than that from normal subjects, with a statistically significant difference . the reduction of mcd <dig> expression on pbmc from cancer patients was not surprising, since it had been reported that cd <dig> was reduced on cd56dim nk cells from myeloma patients with active disease compared with patients in remission and healthy controls  <cit> .

inhibitory effect of cd226-fc fusion protein on the cytotoxicity of normal pbmc against k <dig> cells
it has been well accepted that the cytotoxicity mediated by nk cells and effector t cells is one of the major mechanisms of immune surveillance against tumor cells. however, malignant cells often have developed strategies that counteract immune surveillance of the hosts, such as secreting soluble activating killing receptors and/or their ligands to avoid or reduce this kind of killing  <cit> . to investigate the possible effect of scd <dig> on this cytolytic function against malignant cells, and whether scd <dig> could be one of the tumor escape strategies, a cd226-fc fusion protein was used to mimic the function of scd <dig> in vitro. nk cytolytic activity was then measured by co-incubation of normal pbmc with the nk-sensitive k <dig> cell line, which expresses both cd <dig> ligands , in a standard 51cr-release assay, with or without cd226-fc fusion protein. as expected, cd226-fc fusion protein could inhibit the cytotoxicity of nk cells against k <dig> cells in a dose-dependent manner and the inhibition was of statistic significance when the concentration was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ng/ml . although the effective concentration of cd226-fc required for inhibition in vitro was 10– <dig> fold greater than that observed in patients' sera, the situation in vivo is likely to be quite different. first, it is known that many different inhibitory molecules are shed by tumor cells, therefore scd <dig> is likely to constitute only one of a number of molecules that each contribute to inhibition; second, natural scd <dig> in vivo may contain structural differences from the cd226-fc fusion protein, which was expressed and purified artificially and in a form of homodimer linked by human ig fc fragment, and these may yield a higher affinity of binding to cd <dig> and/or cd <dig>  it can be speculated, therefore, that the increased scd <dig> in sera from tumor patients might play a role in blocking or inhibiting the binding of mcd <dig> to its ligands on the tumor cell, thereby inhibiting tumor cell lysis.

regulation of scd <dig> and mcd <dig> by protease inhibitors
having observed the increased serum scd <dig> in cancer patients and presenting a possible role for the increased scd <dig>  we then sought to determine the origin of the scd <dig>  based on the fact that many transmembrane molecules are cleaved by certain proteases and shed into the circulation, and that several kinds of proteases can be induced in vitro by treatment with pma  <cit> , we investigated the effect on the regulation of scd <dig> and mcd <dig> of pma-stimulated normal pbmc and jurkat cells by the treatment with  <dig> different protease inhibitors . as shown in fig. 3a and 3b, three of the  <dig> protease inhibitors  significantly decreased scd <dig> level and increased mcd <dig> expression of the cultured cells treated with pma. these data indicate that cd <dig> can be shed from the cell surface by proteolysis and released into the circulation in soluble form, and this shedding might involve more than one protease. similarly, many other transmembrane receptors and cell adhesion molecules, can be shed from the cell surface by proteolysis and released into the circulation in soluble form, and such shedding can involve more than one protease  <cit> . our finding that this process likely occurs in a number of cancers is perhaps not surprising since it is known that in these conditions many proteases are up-regulated  <cit> .

characterization of the scd226
in order to exclude the possibility that the scd <dig> was, in fact, intact mcd <dig> derived from dead cells, we characterized the molecular weight of scd <dig> both in sera samples from healthy donors and cancer patients and in the culture supernatants from normal pbmc and jurkat cells treated with pma for  <dig> h. all the four samples were aliquoted into  <dig> tubes: one was precipitated with normal mouse igg-sepharose 4b and probed with an anti-cd <dig> mab fmu <dig>  <cit> , one was precipitated with leoa1-sepharose 4b and probed with anti-sed  mab, and the other was precipitated with leoa1-sepharose 4b and probed with fmu <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  protein bands were only observed when the samples were precipitated with leoa1-sepharose 4b and probed with fmu <dig>  as expected, a band with molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda, coincident with the extracellular domain of cd <dig> molecule, was found in all the four kinds of sera and supernatant samples. interestingly, another weaker band, with molecular massed of ~ <dig> kda, was observed in sera samples, but not in supernatant samples. based on these findings, we speculate a reasonable explanation for the smaller molecule might be the variety of proteases in vivo, leading to the cleavage of scd <dig> from different sites of the intact molecule. however, the possibility of heterogeneous glycosylation of scd <dig> in vivo cannot be excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
we have revealed that the scd <dig> levels in sera of cancer patients is significantly enhanced compared with that in normal subjects, while there is a concomitant reduction in mcd <dig> expression on pbmc isolated from cancer patients. cd226-fc fusion protein can notably inhibit the cytotoxicity of normal pbmc against k <dig> cells, indicating that the increased scd <dig> might be one of the immune escape strategies used by tumor cells. three protease inhibitors can decrease scd <dig> level and increase mcd <dig> expression of pma-stimulated pbmc and jurkat cells, indicating that the increased serum scd <dig> in cancer patients might be shed from the cell surface by several proteases, which are often up-regulated when tumor occurs. these findings suggest that scd <dig> might be used as a predictor for monitoring cancer, and more important, a possible immunotherapy target, which may be useful in clinical application.
