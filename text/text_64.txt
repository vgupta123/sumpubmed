BACKGROUND
meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that produces the haploid cells needed for sexual reproduction. completion of meiosis is normally coupled to differentiation programs that produce gametes. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, sporulation is triggered in diploid cells in the absence of nitrogen and in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source, such as acetate  <cit> . during meiosis, one round of s phase is followed by two meiotic divisions that generate four haploid nuclei. during meiosis ii, a differentiation program starts, resulting in the formation of spores . encapsulation of the four haploid nuclei into spores requires the modification of the spindle pole body  by the incorporation of several meiosis-specific proteins to form the meiosis ii outer plaque  <cit> . once the meiosis ii spb outer plaque has been assembled, secretory vesicles coalesce on this structure to form flattened double-membrane sheets termed prospore membranes  <cit> . the prospore membranes continue to expand during meiosis ii, and at the time of nuclear division each prospore membrane completely engulfs the nuclear lobe to which it is anchored via the spb. at the end of meiosis ii, each prospore membrane closes around the daughter nucleus , creating immature spores. the final step of spore formation requires the de novo synthesis of a spore wall, which occurs in the lumen between the two prospore membranes . this spore cell wall is responsible for the stress resistance of spores.

septins are a family of filament-forming proteins that play crucial roles in morphogenesis. in yeasts, during vegetative growth septins are normally assembled in a ring-like structure at the site where the septum between mother and daughter cells is to be placed  <cit> . the structure, dynamics and regulation of septins are well known in s. cerevisiae. their biological functions in vegetative yeast cells are two-fold  <cit> : first, they act as a scaffold for anchoring other regulatory proteins that control the establishment of the septation site and cytokinesis, bud-site selection, and spindle positioning. second, they form a diffusion barrier to control the molecular trafficking between mother and daughter cells  <cit> . there are seven septin genes in s. cerevisiae. in vegetative cells, the septin ring is composed of five septins: cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig> and shs1/sep <dig>  during the sporulation program, two additional septins, spr <dig> and spr <dig>  are specifically induced  <cit> . in meiotic cells, transcription of two of the vegetative septins -cdc <dig> and cdc10- is also upregulated, while expression of cdc <dig>  cdc <dig> and shs <dig> is similar to vegetative cells  <cit> . in addition, the ssp <dig> protein was recently proposed to be a non-conventional septin required for prospore membrane closure  <cit> . during spore formation, septins disappear from the bud neck and relocalize later to specific regions of the developing spore. in early meiosis ii, septins are assembled as four ring-like structures surrounding each spb, after which they expand into a pair of bars or sheets that run parallel to the long axis of the prospore membrane as it grows  <cit> . after closure of the prospore membrane, the septins become diffusely localized at the spore periphery  <cit> . even though septins are closely associated with the prospore membrane, disruption studies have revealed only modest sporulation defects in septin mutants, suggesting that septins may function redundantly in spore formation  <cit> . septin organization onto the prospore membrane requires gip <dig>  a sporulation-specific regulatory subunit of the glc <dig> protein phosphatase  <cit> . during sporulation, gip <dig> and glc <dig> colocalize with septins throughout prospore membrane formation. mutation of gip <dig> leads to the failure of septins to localize to the prospore membrane, indicating that gip <dig> may organize and form part of the septin complex.

even though septin localization has been reported during spore formation  <cit> , no data exist in regards to septin localization during the early phases of meiosis, from disassembly of the vegetative bud neck septin ring to the formation of the ring-like structures that surround the prospore membrane. here, we provide evidence that the nutrient limitation signal that triggers the sporulation process also induces the disassembly of the septin bud neck ring and relocalization of the septin subunits to the nucleus. septins remain associated with microtubules during the meiotic divisions, rather than being dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and later, during the spore morphogenesis program, they are detected associated to the nascent prospore membranes surrounding each nuclear lobe. septin association to microtubules was also observed when cells were grown vegetatively in media containing non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate.

RESULTS
cdc <dig> localizes with microtubules during meiosis i and meiosis ii
previous studies reported that the cdc <dig> septin localizes to the prospore membranes at the end of meiosis ii  <cit> . some fluorescence associated with the microtubules was also observed, although it was attributed to the strong tubulin signal. to analyze the localization of cdc <dig> during the different phases of meiosis in greater detail, indirect immunofluorescence was used. the wild-type strain an <dig> was incubated in sporulation medium and aliquots were collected at different times after the induction of sporulation. septin localization was analyzed using anti-cdc <dig> antibodies. samples were stained with dapi to monitor progression through meiosis. the results obtained indicated that cdc <dig> clearly localized in a pattern that was reminiscent of the spb and the astral microtubules during early meiosis. . during later stages of meiosis, cdc <dig> localized to spindle microtubules  during meiosis and the prospore membrane , as previously described  <cit> . finally, in post-meiotic cells, cdc <dig> appeared uniformly distributed throughout the membranes that surrounded the developing spore .

to confirm that cdc <dig> localized to microtubules, we repeated the immunofluorescence using anti-cdc <dig> and anti-tubulin antibodies. during meiosis i, cdc <dig> was first observed in prophase cells in a structure that was coincident with the spb and microtubules, as judged by the similar pattern observed for septins and microtubules . during metaphase i and anaphase i, microtubules assembled the meiosis i spindle in the nucleus, and septin localization was also coincident . as previously described  <cit> , at the onset of meiosis ii a fraction of cdc <dig> was detected concentrated in ring-like structures that surrounded the four spindle-pole bodies , which corresponded to the first stages of prospore membrane assembly, although some fluorescence was also associated with the meiotic spindle. in the later stages of meiosis ii , cdc <dig> appeared localized around the prospore membrane as it expanded to engulf the nuclear lobes and also around the spores. in all cases, a fraction of cdc <dig> remained associated with the microtubules during meiosis ii until final disassembly of the spindle, at which time cdc <dig> was only found in the membranes surrounding the spores . thus, cdc <dig> co-localized with the tubulin cytoskeleton during meiosis i and meiosis ii.

the specificity of the staining was assessed using several controls . wild-type exponentially growing cells were stained with anti-cdc <dig> antibody  or doubly stained with anti-cdc <dig> and anti-tubulin antibodies . no cdc <dig> signal was detected associated with microtubules or the mitotic spindle in any of the two controls. to further confirm the specificity of the staining, immunofluorescence was also performed in sporulating wild-type cells using anti-gfp antibodies and either of two secondary antibodies . no staining was detected in these controls . thus, these results rule out the possibility that the apparent cdc <dig> localization to the microtubules might be due to mixed signals from different channels or non-specific antibody binding. they also confirm that cdc <dig> is indeed associated with the spindle during greater part of meiosis.

to examine the localization of cdc <dig> and microtubules more precisely, we used a spectral confocal microscope. the results showed that cdc <dig> and tubulin had a similar localization through the different phases of meiosis . the co-localization between cdc <dig> and tubulin after transfer to sporulation medium was observed in cells that had not initiated meiotic divisions . cdc <dig> localization with microtubules was maintained during meiosis i and meiosis ii . however, analysis of the overlaid signals indicated that there was a partial overlap in the localization of cdc <dig> and tubulin, since there were some regions in which the signal was perfectly coincident, but also other regions in which only one of the signals was present. these results indicate that cdc <dig> is associated with the microtubules and spb during meiosis in s. cerevisiae, although the colocalization is not complete.

septins interact with microtubules during sporulation
to obtain physical evidence of the interaction between septins and microtubules during sporulation, immunoprecipitation assays were used. a wild-type strain expressing tub1-gfp was transferred to sporulation medium and cells were collected after  <dig> h to prepare protein extracts. dapi staining of the culture indicated that around 40% of the cells had  <dig> nuclei and around 5% were binucleated at this time point. samples were immunoprecipitated using anti-cdc <dig> antibody and the presence of tubulin in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed using anti-gfp antibody. the results indicated that the anti-cdc <dig> antibody was able to immunoprecipitate tub1-gfp from protein extracts prepared from sporulating cells . the cdc11-tub <dig> interaction was specific, since no tub1-gfp was immunoprecipitated from cells lacking tub1-gfp  or when anti-cdc <dig> was omitted from the reaction . it has been reported that microtubules interact with the septin ring during vegetative growth, and that this interaction is necessary for the alignment of the spindle along the mother-bud axis  <cit> . to test whether the cdc11-tub <dig> physical interaction was also detected during vegetative growth, we repeated the immunoprecipitation from exponentially growing vegetative cells and in this case, it was not possible to detect physical interaction between tub1-gfp and cdc <dig> . thus, these results indicate that cdc <dig> not only colocalizes with microtubules but that it is physically associated with tubulin during meiosis as well.

cdc <dig> and spr <dig> also colocalize with microtubules during meiosis
to test whether other septins had a similar distribution to that observed for cdc <dig>  we analyzed the localization of two additional septins: cdc <dig> and the sporulation-specific septin spr <dig>  to this end, we used strains carrying either cdc10-gfp or spr28-gfp and the localization of the proteins was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-gfp antibodies, since in our hands, the gfp fluorescence was very weak during meiosis i and could not be clearly distinguished from the cytoplasmic background. cdc <dig> was also found associated with linear structures resembling meiotic spindles during meiosis i and meiosis ii . similarly, the sporulation-specific septin spr <dig> also localized to microtubules . these results therefore suggest that other septins, not just cdc <dig>  associate with microtubules during meiosis in s. cerevisiae.

in vegetative cells, loss of one of the essential septins causes the disassembly of the septin ring at the bud neck. so, we decided to check if in the absence of some septins, such as the sporulation-specific septins spr <dig> and spr <dig>  cdc <dig> was able to localize correctly during sporulation. to test this, cdc <dig> localization was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence in a spr3Δ spr28Δ double mutant in sporulating conditions. the results showed that cdc <dig> localization in the double mutant was generally similar to that in the wild-type strain , and it was found associated with meiotic spindles during meiosis i and meiosis ii. upon induction of prospore membrane assembly, cdc <dig> localized to the nascent prospore membranes, although cdc <dig> did not display the concentrated bar-like structures seen in wild type cells. these results indicate that the cdc <dig> interaction with microtubules and its assembly in the structure that surrounds each nuclear lobe does not require the sporulation-specific septins spr <dig> and spr <dig> suggesting structural differences between septin complexes localized to different sites.

spr <dig> and spr <dig> are required for septin organization during meiosis ii
the failure of cdc <dig> to localize to bars during meiosis ii in the spr <dig> spr <dig> strain was reminiscent of the localization previously described for cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> in sporulating spr <dig> cells  <cit> . to investigate the requirements for septin organization in the prospore membrane during meiosis ii further, the localizations of gfp fusions to five different septins -cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  spr <dig>  and spr28- were analyzed during sporulation in spr <dig> and spr <dig> single mutants. in wild type cells, all five proteins localized in the bar pattern during meiosis ii and were distributed uniformly around the prospore membrane in post-meiotic cells . in the spr <dig> single mutant, although the other four septins associated with the prospore membrane during meiosis ii, they localized uniformly around the membrane rather than being restricted into bars. this indicates that spr <dig> is necessary for the tight organization of septins on the prospore membrane. the phenotype of the spr <dig> mutant was even more severe. all four of the other septins are localized diffusely through the cytosol and failed to associate with the prospore membrane, though a weak association with the prospore membrane was sometimes seen, particularly for cdc <dig>  the delocalization of cdc11-gfp visualized by gfp fluorescence is more dramatic than that seen using anti-cdc <dig> antibodies . however, in all cases it is clear that the sporulation-specific septins are important for the proper association of cdc <dig> with the prospore membrane during meiosis ii.

cdc <dig> has different requirements for microtubule and prospore membrane localization
to confirm that cdc <dig> localization during meiosis was dependent on the microtubule cytoskeleton, cells were treated with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug benomyl. it has been reported that meiotic cells treated with benomyl arrest in g <dig> if microtubule perturbation occurs as they enter the meiotic cycle and in g <dig> if they are already undergoing the pre-meiotic s phase  <cit> . to completely depolymerize the microtubules without affecting progression through meiosis, cells were incubated in sporulation medium for  <dig> h and then transferred to sporulation medium containing  <dig> μg/ml benomyl. after  <dig> minutes of incubation with the drug, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using anti-cdc <dig> and anti-tubulin antibodies. progression through meiosis was monitored by staining the cells with dapi . even though around 70% of the cells had completed meiosis ii at this time point, cells in previous stages of meiosis were also present at lower frequency, and some examples are shown in figure 5a. exposure to benomyl caused a complete depolymerization of microtubules , and only the spbs exhibited reactivity with anti-tubulin antibodies . interestingly, microtubule disorganization also resulted in cdc <dig> delocalization from the linear structures found during early phases of meiosis, and this septin was only detected associated with the tubulin remaining in the spbs  or diffuse in the nucleus and cytoplasm . however, in late meiosis ii cells and post-meiotic cells, in which cdc <dig> was found associated respectively with the microtubules and the prospore membrane or the prospore membrane only, microtubule depolymerization had no effects on cdc <dig> localization on the prospore membrane , suggesting that cdc <dig> association with the prospore membrane is independent of microtubules and tubulin. in a mock-treated culture, no effects on microtubule or cdc <dig> localization were observed . therefore, these results indicate that cdc <dig> localization to the meiotic spindle requires the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton.

gip <dig> is a developmentally regulated protein phosphatase 1-interacting protein that targets the glc <dig> protein phosphatase to the growing prospore membranes. this gip1-glc <dig> complex is required for proper septin localization around the prospore membranes  <cit> . to test whether gip <dig> was also required for the septin interaction with microtubules and meiotic spindles, cdc <dig> localization was analyzed in a gip1Δ mutant. in this strain, we found that cdc <dig> was able to bind microtubules and that it localized to the meiotic spindles during all phases of meiosis, similar to wild-type cells . prospore membrane localization was seen in only a small fraction of cells , showing a ring-like pattern surrounding four nuclei, as noted previously for the septins spr <dig> and spr <dig> in gip <dig> mutants  <cit> . the appearance of this small fraction of cells suggests that gip <dig> is not required for the dissociation of cdc <dig> from the microtubules or for its nuclear export. that is, gip <dig> is required for proper septin organization around the prospore membrane, but is not required for the septin interaction with microtubules and meiotic spindles during meiosis. thus, the cdc11-microtubule interaction is differently regulated from that of the cdc11-psm interaction.

temporal pattern of septin localization to microtubules and prospore membranes
we next analyzed the timing of septin localization to microtubules and from the microtubules to the psm during meiosis in more detail. cells were grown to stationary phase in ypacetate before transfer to the sporulation medium. samples were then taken at short intervals after transfer to sporulation medium and stained with anti-cdc <dig> antibody. at time  <dig> h, most of the cells were unbudded and around 80% of them showed no specific cdc <dig> staining . however, after  <dig> h of incubation in sporulation medium, cdc <dig> was found to be associated with microtubules in more than 90% of the cells. these results therefore suggest that septins localize to microtubules shortly after transfer to sporulation medium, before the onset of the sporulation program.

to analyze the moment at which septins move from the meiosis ii spindle to the nascent prospore membrane in more detail, cdc <dig> localization was analyzed in cells carrying gfp-spo2051– <dig>  spo <dig> is a sporulation-specific protein that is required for spore morphogenesis  <cit> . spo <dig> is necessary for the coalescence of precursor vesicles on the spb to form the prospore membrane, and it localizes to this nascent structure during metaphase ii  <cit> . colocalization experiments using gfp-spo2051– <dig> and anti-cdc <dig> revealed that during metaphase ii, spo <dig> started to accumulate around the spb and nascent prospore membranes, and spo <dig> localization to this region was usually detected before cdc <dig> appearance at the psms . cdc <dig> started to assemble the ring-like structures that colocalized with spo <dig> in metaphase ii , as previously described  <cit> . as the prospore membrane grew in size during anaphase ii, cdc <dig> signal increased at the prospore membrane . the association with the prospore membrane was then maintained in post-meiotic cells during spore development . these results suggest that the signal that induces cdc <dig> localization to the nascent prospore membranes is dependent on the initiation of the differentiation program and occurs after prospore membrane assembly has started.

septin association to microtubules is dependent on the nutrient starvation signal
when entering sporulation, diploid cells are exposed to two different nutritional stimuli, exposure to a non-fermentable carbon source and nitrogen deprivation. as a consequence of these signals, diploid cells initiate a developmental program that promotes the formation of spores. to test whether bud neck septin ring disassembly and relocalization of the septin subunits to the microtubules was a consequence of the induction of the meiotic program or a response to the nutrient starvation signal, cdc <dig> localization was analyzed in the an117-16d strain, one of the parental haploid strains of an <dig>  haploid cells were incubated for  <dig> h in ypacetate medium before transfer to the sporulation medium, samples were removed at different time-points and stained with anti-cdc <dig> antibody to analyze cdc <dig> localization. the results indicated that cdc <dig> associates to microtubules in haploid cells with similar kinetics to that previously described for diploid cells . thus, these data indicate that septin relocalization to microtubules occurs shortly after transfer to sporulation medium, and that nutrient limitation, and not the induction of the sporulation program, must be the signal that triggers this reorganization of the septins.

in the course of these experiments, we noticed that some cdc <dig> was present at the microtubules in some cells even at time  <dig> , suggesting that this septin could also interact with the tubulin cytoskeleton during vegetative growth depending on nutritional growth conditions. so, to analyze in further detail the nature of the nutrient signal, we studied cdc <dig> localization in haploid cells that were vegetatively grown in different media, collecting samples at different stages of the growth curve. we used media containing different carbon sources  and media containing poor nitrogen sources  to distinguish different nutritional stimuli. our results showed that nitrogen starvation did not alter the distribution of cdc <dig> compared with cells grown in ypd . however, growth in non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate and glycerol, resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells displaying microtubule staining or a mixed pattern, both the neck and microtubules . other carbon sources, such as glucose or raffinose, did not modify septin localization at the bud neck . thus, these data suggest that cdc <dig> translocation from the neck to the microtubules depends on the nutritional signal, primarily on the carbon source, and this response to the carbon source is enhanced by nitrogen starvation.

one of the consequences of the growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate, is a change in the metabolism from fermentation to respiration. to analyze whether septin association to microtubules was a consequence of this metabolic change, a rho- strain, lacking mitochondria and being unable to respirate, was isolated from the haploid an117-16d. both strains  were grown in ypd overnight and the cells were then inoculated to ypacetate to analyze cdc <dig> localization when cells cannot respirate. the results indicated that cdc <dig> distribution  was similar in the two strains . to confirm this result, the haploid strain an117-16d  was grown in ypacetate to mid-logarithmic phase and transferred to ack 2%  with or without sodium azide to inhibit respiration and cdc <dig> distribution under these conditions was analyzed. samples were taken at different times after the inoculation and stained with anti-cdc <dig> antibodies. no significant differences were observed between the two conditions,  suggesting that inhibition of the electron transfer chain does not interfere with septin localization to microtubules. together, these results indicate that septin relocalization to microtubules is not a consequence of the induction of the sporulation program, but it is specifically induced by a nutritional signal depending on the carbon source. furthermore, the metabolic change from fermentation to respiration does not promote septin association with microtubules.

discussion
septins are conserved gtp-binding proteins that play essential roles in morphogenesis in fungi and higher eukaryotic cells. in budding yeast, septins form a series of filaments that assemble as a ring at the bud neck during vegetative growth. septin rings are thought to function as a scaffold to recruit proteins to the bud neck and as a boundary domain to restrict diffusion during budding and cytokinesis . previous reports have shown that in s. cerevisiae septins localize to the psm during sporogenesis, although it is not known what their function is in this process. it has been proposed that septins could be required for the correct assembly of psms, although mutants lacking several septins have no defects in spore formation, which suggests that septins could act redundantly during this process  <cit> . in the course of the analysis of the role of the cdc <dig> kinase during sporulation  <cit> , we used cdc <dig> as a marker for analysis of psm morphology by indirect immunofluorescence and noticed that cdc <dig> had a localization pattern similar to that of the microtubule cytoskeleton at early time-points of the sporulation time-course. in addition, previous reports had already observed the localization of several septins, such as cdc <dig> or spr <dig>  at the microtubules although it was assumed that it was a cross of fluorescence channels  <cit> .

dynamic behavior of septins during sporulation
in s. cerevisiae, septin localization at the bud neck during vegetative growth is relatively constant  <cit> . by contrast, our results show here that septins localization and behavior is much more variable through the process of sporulation. analysis of septin localization during sporulation has been addressed by using two different techniques, in vivo analysis using gfp fusions and immunofluorescence in fixed cells. microtubule association of cdc <dig> and other septins was mainly detected by indirect immunofluorescence, while it was not detected using gfp fusions. conversely, prospore membrane localization was clearly seen with both techniques. one possible reason to explain these differences is the relative amounts of septins associated with these two structures. it could be that the fraction of septins that interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton is low and that its interaction is very dynamic, making difficult its detection in vivo. on the other hand, fixation of the cells for immunofluorescence could stabilize the fraction of septins associated to microtubules or modify the proteins, facilitating its detection with specific antibodies.

during sporulation, cdc <dig> localizes to different cell compartments; the spbs, astral microtubules , the meiotic spindle  and the psm. the association of cdc <dig> with microtubules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, although our results do not indicate whether the interaction between tubulin and septins is direct or mediated by other proteins. furthermore, analysis of cdc <dig> and spr <dig> localization indicated that septin-microtubules interaction during sporulation is not exclusive to cdc <dig>  but it is a characteristic of other septins as well. spr <dig> and cdc <dig> localization to the microtubules was weak but both proteins strongly accumulated at the psms later in sporogenesis, whereas the cdc <dig> signal was more intense in the microtubule cytoskeleton and declined during spore wall formation. colocalization of spr28-gfp and cdc <dig>  supported the idea that affinity for microtubules or the psm is different. although this observation should be verified in greater detail, it is possible that these differences only reflect the different temporal pattern of expression of the genes during sporulation, since spr <dig> and cdc <dig> are induced as middle sporulation genes while cdc <dig> is constitutively expressed, but at a lower level  <cit> .

our experiments show that tubulin-cdc <dig> interaction and cdc11-psm interaction during sporulation are independent. this is supported by several experiments: first, depolymerization of the microtubule cytoskeleton using benomyl resulted in delocalization of the fraction of cdc <dig> that was associated to tubulin, but it had no effect on those molecules that were localized to the psm. in contrast, the absence of gip <dig> is sufficient to disorganize septins at the psm  <cit> , but has no effects on the septins localizing to the microtubule cytoskeleton. second, nutritional experiments and the fact that spo <dig> vesicles arrived earlier than cdc <dig> to the meiotic outer plate of the spb suggests that cdc <dig> localization to microtubules and psm are independently regulated and respond to different signals. thus, our results clearly indicate that cdc11-microtubule association is triggered by a nutritional signal and also occurs during vegetative growth, while septin-psm association is part of the developmental program that leads to the production of spores  <cit> .

the genetic requirements for these different localizations are also distinct during sporulation. during vegetative growth, absence of an essential septin results in defects in the localization of the other septins and septin ring disassembly. in contrast, during sporulation, cdc <dig> can localize to microtubules in the absence of spr <dig> and spr <dig> or gip <dig>  but its subsequent localization on the prospore membrane is altered. in the absence of spr <dig>  the remaining septins cannot form discrete bars but are localized uniformly around the prospore membrane throughout meiosis ii. mutation of spr <dig> is distinct from spr28Δ in that not just the sheets, but the association of the remaining septins with the prospore membrane is greatly reduced. in this respect, mutation of spr <dig> resembles a gip <dig> mutant  <cit> . thus, though the function of the septins at the prospore membrane remains obscure, the sporulation-specific septins play direct and distinct roles in the organization of septin complexes during sporulation. the differential genetic requirements for septin localization at different stages of sporulation suggest that the organization of the septins themselves is changing during this process. it is noteworthy that the ability of spr <dig> to associate with other septins depends on the phase of the life cycle. when ectopically expressed in vegetative cells, spr <dig> does not localize with other septins at the bud neck  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that both the localization and the organization of the septins are changing dynamically throughout sporulation.

one possible explanation for these observations is that the stoichiometry of the septin subunits could be different during the successive phases of the sporulation process, and these differences could be important for their association to microtubules or psm. structural studies of mammalian septins suggest that the basic organization of a septin filament is a heterotrimer  <cit> . it may be that different combinations of septins produce filaments with different properties. if so, understanding what these changes are and how they are regulated in yeast could prove insightful in other organisms which, like s. cerevisiae, express more than three septin proteins.

septin-tubulin interactions
septin-tubulin interactions had been previously observed in budding yeast  <cit> , but this interaction was not analyzed in this organism. however, in mammalian cells, septins localize not only to the plasma membrane but also throughout the cytoplasm, interacting with the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons, where they act as a scaffold for cytoskeleton-binding proteins . for example, the mammalian septin sept <dig>  colocalizes during interphase with actin, microtubules and another mammalian septin, sept <dig>  during mitosis  <cit> . sept <dig> filaments are associated with actin fibers, and play a role in stabilization of actin stress fibers preventing actin turnover  <cit> . it has also been shown that sept <dig> and sept <dig> can align along microtubules during interphase in pc <dig> and hela cells  <cit> , and sept <dig> has been reported to associate with spindle microtubules during mitosis  <cit> . furthermore, in mammalian cells septins not only interact with microtubules or actin cytoskeleton, but also control their organization and stability. this is the case of the mammalian septin complex composed of sept2/6/ <dig>  which regulates microtubule stability through an interaction with the microtubule-binding protein map <dig>  <cit>  or actin organization through nuclear accumulation of the adaptor protein nck  <cit> . moreover, it has also been suggested that sept <dig> might have a function in microtubule organization during cytokinesis  <cit> . in yeast, it is unlikely that septins may play a similar role in microtubule cytoskeleton organization, although it has been reported that microtubules interact with the septin ring to align the mitotic spindle along the mother-bud axis during vegetative growth  <cit> .

septin localization to microtubules and nutritional stimuli
in unicellular organisms, sporulation is a process necessary for cells to survive when environmental conditions change. in s. cerevisiae, sporulation is triggered in response to nitrogen deprivation and, this process is induced when cells are grown in a non-fermentable carbon source such as acetate. analysis of cdc <dig> localization in sporulating cells indicated that cdc <dig> localized to the microtubules shortly after transfer to sporulation medium, and the same pattern was observed also in haploid cells, suggesting that the nutritional stimulus is the main signal responsible for the change in septin distribution. a deeper analysis of cdc <dig> localization to microtubules in haploid cells has resulted in the following conclusions: 1) cdc <dig> associates with microtubules during vegetative growth under certain nutritional stimuli, so cdc <dig> can interact with tubulin independently of the developmental stage; 2) non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate or glycerol, were the signal triggering cdc <dig> association with microtubules; 3) the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources per se and not the transition to the respiratory metabolism is the origin of the stimulus that promotes cdc <dig> localization to the tubulin cytoskeleton; and 4) though nitrogen starvation cannot trigger septin relocalization to microtubules, the absence of nitrogen enhances the effect of a non-fermentable carbon source. thus, these results suggest that cdc <dig> has the ability to interact to tubulin at different moments of the yeast life cycle.

at the moment, we do not know the exact nature of the signal that triggers cdc <dig> association to microtubules. one possibility is that it involves changes in the intracellular concentration of a secondary messenger, such as camp or intracellular ph, allowing the interaction of tubulin and septins, two families of structural proteins, to maintain cytoskeleton polymerization under these conditions. whether these complexes constitute only a response to intracellular changes or they have an active role has yet to be elucidated. the first possibility in good agreement with results from mammalian cells, in which sept <dig> polymerizes forming structures inside the cytoplasm without any defined function when actin cytoskeleton is perturbed  <cit> . in budding yeast, release of septins from the neck and polymerization of proteins in the cytoplasm could be a mechanism to store proteins temporarily until intracellular conditions would be reestablished to promote an active role of these proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
nutrient limitation in s. cerevisiae triggers the sporulation process, but it also induces the disassembly of the septin bud neck ring and relocalization of the septin subunits to the nucleus. septins remain associated with microtubules during the meiotic divisions and later, during spore morphogenesis, they are detected associated to the nascent prospore membranes surrounding each nuclear lobe. septin association to microtubules also occurs during growth in non-fermentable carbon sources.
