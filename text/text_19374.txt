BACKGROUND
gastric cancer, as a common cancer, has the third highest mortality rate in both sexes worldwide, especially in developing countries and regions  <cit> . however, lack of effective early diagnostic methods makes gastric cancer usually be diagnosed at late stages and missed the best treatment time for curative surgery and radiotherapy  <cit> . meanwhile, chemotherapy usually causes severe side effects, such as nausea, vomit, white blood cell reduction etc., and thus is not suitable for elder or weak patients. hence, early diagnosis and targeted therapy are critical for better prognosis of gastric cancer in the future. it has been reported that multiple gene abnormalities led to the initiation and development of gastric cancer  <cit> . thus, investigating the underling mechanisms and identifying key genes of gastric cancer will provide novel evidences for early diagnosis and targeted therapy against gastric cancer.

gamma glutamyl cyclotransferase/glutamyl cyclotransferase-γ , as a critical enzyme in the regulation of a γ-glutamyl cycle via mediation of glutathione degradation, can specifically convert γ-glu-aa into pyroglutamate   <cit> . it has been reported that ggct was strongly accumulated in various cancers, including breast, bladder, esophagus, stomach and lung cancers . knockdown of ggct can suppress cell proliferation ability in bladder cancer cells  <cit>  and induced the cell cytotoxicity against mcf-7/adr cells in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . taken together, ggct was overexpressed in many cancer cells, including gastric cancer. however, the underling mechanism of how ggct regulates gastric cancer remains elusive.

to explore the biological function and its underlying mechanism of ggct in human gastric cancer, the present study firstly confirmed that the expression level of ggct is highly in gastric cancer tissues by analyzing data derived from oncomine database. knockdown of ggct with the shrna system significantly suppressed cell features, including cell proliferation, colony formation ability in gastric cancer cells. furthermore, we found that depletion of ggct promotes late apoptosis and induced gastric cancer cells to be arrested in sub-g <dig> and g2/m phases. these results indicated that ggct plays an important role in cell proliferation and progression of gastric cancer.

lenti-shggct reduces ggct expression in human gastric cancer mgc80- <dig> and ags cells
to explore the role ggct plays in human gastric cancer, a lentiviral vector system expressing shrna against ggct was constructed in mgc80- <dig> and ags cells. gfp was applied as a reporter gene. the high rate of gfp-positive cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy at 96 h post-infection , which suggests the high efficiency of infection. the ggct knock-down efficiency was further validated at both mrna and protein levels. as fig. 2b and c display, the relative mrna and protein expression of ggct  were significantly decreased in the mgc80-3and ags cells infected by lenti-shggct, compared with the cells infected with lenti-shcon and the control cells. those results indicated that the lenti-shrna infection system exerted powerful and specific knock-down effects on ggct expression in mgc80- <dig> and ags cells.fig.  <dig> lentivirus-mediated shrna specifically reduced ggct expression in mgc80- <dig> and ags cells. a green fluorescent images of mgc80- <dig> cells under a 100× magnification microscope and under inverted fluorescent microscope at 96 h after lentivirus infection, showing the successful infection of lentivirus expressing lenti-shggct, lenti-shcon, or con, scale bars, 10 μm. b the mrna levels of ggct in mgc80- <dig> and ags cells after lentivirus infection analyzed by qrt-pcr. c ggct protein levels in mgc80- <dig> and ags cells after lentivirus infection analyzed by western blot. ***p <  <dig> 




lenti-shggct suppressed the viability and proliferation of mgc80- <dig> and ags cells
to discover the potential functions of ggct in gastric cancer, the cell proliferation assay was conducted. the lenti-shcon and lenti-shggct infected mgc80- <dig> and ags cells were seeded on 96-well plates for a mtt assay in the following 5 days. interestingly, the depletion of ggct significantly attenuated the proliferation ability of mgc80- <dig> and ags cells, as compared with that in lenti-shcon infected and control cells . in addition, colony formation plays a critical role in the development of tumor in vivo. to study whether ggct depletion affected the clonogenic potential of gastric cancer cells, the colony formation assay was performed in mgc80- <dig> cells. as lenti-shggct infected mgc80- <dig> cells exhibited a complete ggct depletion, it resulted in better performance in proliferation assay as compared with that in ags cells. notably, much less colonies formed in lenti-shggct infected mgc80- <dig> cells, compared tomgc80- <dig> cells infected with lenti-shcon  . these results indicated that ggct depletion significantly slowed cell proliferation and suppressed colony formation potential of mgc80- <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> knockdown of ggct inhibited the viability and proliferation of mgc80- <dig> and ags cells. a the growth curve of mgc80- <dig> and ags cells with different treatments  assessed by mtt assay. b images of mgc80- <dig> cells recorded under micro and macro view, representing the size and the number of colonies in each group of cells. c statistical analysis for the number of colonies formed in mgc80- <dig> cells with different treatments . all data represented as mean ± sd from  <dig> independent experiments. ***p <  <dig> 




ggct depletion caused cell cycle arrest in mgc80- <dig> cells
to identify the mechanism underling the anti-proliferation effect of ggct depletion, cell cycle distribution of shggct-infected mgc80- <dig> cells was analyzed by flow cytometry . there was a significant reduction of cell number of lenti-shggct infected mgc80- <dig> cells in g0/g <dig> phase and a corresponding increase in g2/m phase, compared with lenti-shcon infected and control cells . in addition, infection of lenti-shggct resulted in a remarkable increase of mgc80- <dig> cell number in the sub-g <dig> phase  suggesting that ggct depletion might induce cell apoptosis.fig.  <dig> knockdown of ggct induced cell cycle arrest during g2/m and sub-g1phase in mgc80- <dig> cells. a facs analysis of cell cycle distribution in mgc80- <dig> cells. a hypodiploid apex representing the apoptotic cells was found before the g1apex in lenti-shggct infected mgc80- <dig> cells. b down-regulation of ggct in mgc80-3cells led to an increase of cells at g2/m phase and concomitantly a decrease of cells at g0/g <dig> phase. c down-regulation of ggct in mgc80- <dig> cells led to an increase of cells at sub-g <dig> phase. data represents mean ± sd from  <dig> independent experiments. ** p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 




ggct depletion caused cell apoptosis
in order to determine the effects of ggct depletion on apoptosis of gastric cancer cell, annexin v/pi double staining was performed on mgc80- <dig> cells. interestingly, after observing annexin v/pi double positive cells, it was found that depletion of ggct largely promoted late apoptosis . statistical analysis revealed that approximately 30-fold and 15-foldincrease of late apoptotic populations was detected in lenti-shggct-infected mgc80- <dig> cells , as compared to lenti-shcon-infected and control mgc80- <dig> cells , respectively . these results indicated downregulation of ggct could promote cell apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.fig.  <dig> knockdownof ggct induced cell apoptosis in mgc80- <dig> cells. apoptosis cells were assessed by annexin v/pi double staining and then were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. a representative images showing annexin v/pi staining results in mgc80- <dig> cells with different treatments . b statistical analysis of the apoptosis assay. **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> . the experiment was performed in triplicates




discussion
gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide as usually be diagnosed at late stages and missed the best treatment time  <cit> . thus, early diagnosis and targeted therapy are critical for better prognosis of gastric cancer. to investigate the underling mechanisms and identify key molecular markers will provide novel evidences for early diagnosis and targeted therapy against gastric cancer. ggct is a critical enzyme that regulates the biological processes of glutathione, which is the major antioxidant in cells. herein, we identified ggct was expressedhigher in human gastric cancer tissues than normal tissues. knockdown of ggct weakened cell proliferation and colony formation abilities of gastric cancer cells via increasing cell cycle arrest and inducting late apoptosis. these findings not only clarify the effects of ggct depletion on gaistric cancer, but also provide new evidence and basis for new methodsof early diagnosisand target treatment of gastric cancer.

recently, ggct has been found strongly accumulated in various cancers, including breast, bladder, esophagus, stomach and lung cancers . based on theanalysis of two independent studies in oncomine database, we found that ggct is highly accumulated in gastric cancer cells. furthermore, it has beenproved thatggctfunctioned as a novel biomarker of esophageal squamous malignancies, as its expression levels strongly correlated with lymph node metastasis and differentiation degree , in consistent with that overexpression and depletion of ggct resulted in proliferative and antiproliferative activities in bladder cancer cells, respectively  <cit> . here, we observed that ggct depletion could remarkably inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation activities ofhuman gastric cancer cells.

furthermore, results of cell cycle and apoptosis analysis revealed that ggct inhibition negatively regulated gastric cancer progression via induction of cell arrest and late apoptosis in mgc80- <dig> cells, in consistent withthe study of ggct in lung cancer  <cit> . in previous studies, it wasindicatedthat knockdown of ggct weakened proliferation and colony formation abilities of lung cancer cells through g0/g <dig> phase arrest. moreover, the expression levels of g0/g1-associated markers, cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  and cyclin d <dig>  declinedand the expression level of cleaved parp was obviously increased in ggct knockdown cells  <cit> . ohno et al. found that ggct is closely associated with cell cycle  <cit> , which was consistent with our finding that depeletion of ggct arrested mgc80- <dig> gastric cancer cells in the sub-g <dig> and g2/m phases, suggesting that knockdown of ggct inhibited cell phase transition and suppressed cell proliferation. whether ggct suppress cell proliferation through common cell cycle realted molecules, like cyclins and cdks, will provide deeper understanding of the mechanism and needs further investigation.

furthermore, to alter gene expression in cells, there were various methods, such as rnai with shrna or sirna. this study has generated efficient and stable ggct depletion cell lines using shrna-based ggct knock-down technique instead of sirna. althoughsirna has been widely used as a therapeutic tool  <cit> , administration of sirna often have problems of poor stability, low transfection efficiency, and lowtissue penetration. the shrna-based ggct depletion provides a more stable and reliabe method for lab research use  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study statedthat ggct was upregulated in human gastric cancer tissues. knockdown of ggct inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation via increasing cell cycle arrest and inducting late apoptosis. these findings not only clarify the effects of ggct depletion on gaistric cancer, but also provide new evidence for development of early diagnosis and targeted therapies of human gastric cancer. however, what is the potential correlation between the dysregulated cycle of glutathione and cell division, and whether downregulation of ggct interferes with the transportation of amino acids leading to cell division disruption in gastric cancer need further investigation.
