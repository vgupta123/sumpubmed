BACKGROUND
cell proliferation and growth require the coordination of cell signaling pathways. plc plays an important role in cell signaling, mediating transduction of signals from a variety of intracellular and extracellular stimuli  <cit> . plc-dependent hydrolysis of pip <dig> produces the second messengers dag and ip <dig> . ip <dig> binds specific receptors on the er to mobilize calcium  from internal stores. dag and ca2+ activate protein kinase c , which stimulates cell growth  <cit> . in addition, ca2+ itself facilitates diverse cellular events including membrane trafficking, contractility and proliferation  <cit> . plc-dependent pathways thus play key roles in promoting cell growth.

the synthetic aminosteroid u <dig>  is an important tool in identifying and studying plc-dependent processes. initially discovered in a search for inhibitors of platelet activation, u <dig> was found to inhibit plc function  <cit> . u <dig> causes decreases in ip <dig> and dag production, calcium levels, and phosphatidylinositol  turnover in agonist-stimulated platelets, indicating that u <dig> blocks plc-mediated hydrolysis of pip <dig> in treated cells  <cit> . the mechanism of action of u <dig> is currently unknown  <cit> , although an examination of its structure can provide some insight into the biologically active domains of the molecule. the inhibitory activity of u <dig> can be reduced by alteration of the c <dig> side chain or removal of the 3-methoxy group  <cit> . substitution of the electrophilic maleimide group of u <dig> with the less electrophilic succinimide produces the inactive isomer u <dig>  which differs from the active form only by the absence of a double bond on the pyrrole ring . thus, reactivity appears to reside largely in the nem moiety of the molecule. nem  is a sulfhydryl alkylating agent that covalently modifies cysteine residues, raising the possibility that u <dig> acts by a similar mechanism.

using inhibitors affecting pi metabolism, we previously showed that continuous pi cycling is required for cytokinesis  <cit> . in particular, treatment of cells with u <dig> resulted in regression of the cleavage furrow and failure of cytokinesis  <cit> . the effects of u <dig> suggested pip <dig> hydrolysis is required for normal cytokinesis. indeed, cytokinesis failed in cells treated with an ip <dig> receptor antagonist or in which intracellular ca2+ was chelated by bapta-am  <cit> . perhaps most strikingly, our data indicated that pip <dig> hydrolysis may be required to maintain f-actin in the contractile ring  <cit> .

u <dig> may exert non-specific effects, however, because several lines of evidence suggest that u <dig> may affect phosphoinositide cycling or ca2+ levels independent of plc inhibition. in rabbit platelets, u <dig> caused up to 50% reduction in the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate  and pip <dig>  but not pi, indicating that u <dig> may inhibit both pi and pip kinases. although ip <dig> levels were reduced in agonist-stimulated cells, consistent with inhibition of plc, this may have been an indirect effect of a shortage in substrate availability  <cit> . in u73122-treated mouse fibroblasts and rat neutrophils, inhibition of ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane contributed to the suppression of ca2+ levels  <cit> . in contrast, u <dig> actually increased ca2+ release from internal stores in rat pancreatic acinar cells and rat liver microsomes  <cit> .

a second plc inhibitor, the lysophosphatidylcholine analogue et-18-och <dig> , is of interest in cancer therapy because of its demonstrated anti-tumor properties  <cit> . et-18-och <dig> and related compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and pkc  <cit>  and selectively promote tumor cell apoptosis  <cit> . like u <dig>  et-18-och <dig> also has other off-target effects, including release of ca2+ from intracellular stores  <cit> . however, unlike u <dig>  et-18-och <dig> is inserted in the plasma membrane, and its effects may be due in part to alteration of membrane lipid and protein composition  <cit> . in both human histiocytic lymphoma and tumorigenic rat liver cells, et-18-och <dig> inhibits cytokinesis  <cit> .

to determine if u <dig> inhibits cytokinesis via plc, we compared the effects of u <dig> with those of et-18-och <dig> and nem. we further examined the role of a potential downstream target of plc activity, mlck. we found that inhibition of mlck perturbed cytokinesis in a manner similar to inhibition of plc by u <dig> and et-18-och <dig>  our results are consistent with a model in which plc and mlck act in the same pathway to maintain the integrity of the contractile ring, implicating mlck as a target of ca2+ regulation in this process.

RESULTS
plc inhibition causes cleavage furrows to regress
we previously showed that the plc inhibitor u <dig> caused cleavage furrow regression during cytokinesis in crane-fly and drosophila melanogaster spermatocytes  <cit> . in control cells, cytokinesis was initiated by invagination of the equatorial plasma membrane to form a furrow between the nascent daughter cells    <cit> . ingression continued unabated until the cleavage furrow reached a minimum diameter of one to several micrometers . when added after initiation of furrowing, u <dig> arrested cytokinesis and caused cleavage furrow regression    <cit> . during cleavage, mitochondria and parafusorial membranes along the spindle become constricted as the plasma membrane ingressed at the equator  <cit> . in drosophila spermatocytes treated with u <dig>  these structures remained constricted as the plasma membrane regressed, and often underwent continued constriction of several micrometres after regression of the furrow . the effects of u <dig> were not reversible at any concentration in drosophila; however, in crane-fly spermatocytes, the effects at the minimum effective dosage of u <dig> were reversed after washing  <cit> .

to determine if a second plc inhibitor had a similar effect, we treated dividing crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes with et-18-och <dig>  in both species, et-18-och <dig> inhibited cytokinesis and caused the cleavage furrow to regress  . these effects were seen at concentrations of  <dig> μm or greater in drosophila spermatocytes  and  <dig> μm or greater in crane-fly spermatocytes . in crane-fly spermatocytes, but not in drosophila spermatocytes, cleavage furrow regression was reversible in 2/ <dig> treated cells. thus u <dig> and et-18-och <dig> have similar effects on cytokinesis.

alkylation stops furrow ingression but does not cause regression
to determine if the effects of u <dig> were due to non-specific alkylation of off-target proteins, we directly examined the effects of the alkylating agent nem on cytokinesis. in both crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes, nem stopped cytokinesis but did not cause regression of the cleavage furrow  . the effective concentration differed between the two species. in crane-fly spermatocytes, nem inhibited furrowing at concentrations of  <dig> μm or greater. cleavage arrest occurred immediately after treatment and cleavage furrows did not regress or resume constriction even after the drug was washed out . in drosophila spermatocytes, nem also irreversibly stopped furrowing, although it was effective at concentrations as low as  <dig> nm . in addition, nem caused large blebs to form on the plasma membrane  . nem did not cause regression of cleavage furrows at any concentration tested .

myosin light chain kinase  inactivation causes cleavage furrows to regress
to test if ip <dig> receptor-mediated ca2+ release activates mlck during cytokinesis  <cit> , we examined the effects of ml- <dig>  an inhibitor of mlck and hence of myosin activation. a concentration range of 75– <dig> μm was chosen because lower concentrations had little or no effect on cytokinesis . in both crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes, treatment with  <dig> μm  or  <dig> μm  ml- <dig> caused cleavage furrow regression  . treatment of drosophila spermatocytes with ml- <dig> was reversible upon washout  , unlike treatment with u <dig>  et-18-och <dig> or nem; however, after resuming, ingression arrested prematurely in  <dig> out of  <dig> cells. thus, the effects of ml- <dig> on cytokinesis in drosophila spermatocytes are identical to those previously reported in crane-fly spermatocytes  <cit> . that ml- <dig> treatment blocks cytokinesis in a manner similar to u <dig> and et-18-och <dig> is consistent with plc and mlck acting in the same pathway.

plc and mlck activities are required to maintain actin at the cleavage furrow
to investigate the effect of the various inhibitors on cytoskeletal components, we stained crane-fly spermatocytes for f-actin and tubulin. in control cells, actin filaments were arranged in a circumferential band around the equator of the cell, with very little f-actin at the poles. tubulin was present in spindle and astral microtubules and was organized longitudinally from pole-to-pole . after treatment with u <dig>  tubulin organization was similar to that of control cells. however, actin filaments became much shorter and more disorganized, with many cells showing reduction in f-actin at the cleavage furrow concomitant with accumulation of f-actin at the poles . similarly, after et-18-och <dig> treatment, f-actin accumulated at the poles, with the few actin filaments at the equator appearing more sparsely packed than in control cells . after treatment with ml- <dig>  the distribution of f-actin and tubulin closely resembled treatment with u <dig> and et-18-och3: tubulin localization was unchanged as compared to control cells, whereas f-actin disappeared from the contractile ring and accumulated at the poles. these actin filaments were longer than in u73122-treated cells and appeared more disorganized . in contrast, treatment with nem had an entirely different effect: astral microtubules were absent and f-actin in the contractile ring was dramatically reduced, with the majority of cells  showing a compact band of f-actin at the equator. in addition, f-actin did not accumulate at the poles. actin filaments in the cortex were broken into small fragments or completely depolymerized .

plc and mlck activities are required to maintain activated myosin
to directly test if these inhibitors interfered with phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain , a known target of mlck, we stained dividing drosophila spermatocytes for phosphorylated sqh  and f-actin. in control cells, phospho-sqh strongly colocalized with f-actin in the contractile ring, weakly colocalized with f-actin on the cell cortex at the poles, and was found weakly colocalized with the mitochondria and parafusorial membranes . in contrast, cells treated with u <dig>  et-18-och <dig> or ml- <dig> no longer showed evidence of phospho-sqh or f-actin in the contractile ring. instead, phospho-sqh remained associated with the mitochondria and parafusorial membranes, whereas f-actin accumulated at the poles of the cell .

discussion
u <dig> is widely accepted as a specific inhibitor of plc. nevertheless, its mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated. in some systems, nem mimics treatment with u <dig>  <cit> , raising the possibility that previously reported effects of u <dig> were due to alkylation of off-target proteins rather than inhibition of plc. to obtain such effects with nem, horowitz et al. treated cells with concentrations of nem forty-times larger than those used for u <dig>  the authors suggested that higher concentrations of nem were required because nem lacks the lipophilic steroid domain of u <dig> that targets the nem moiety to membranes  <cit> . consistent with their observations, we found that the concentration required for nem to block cytokinesis in crane-fly spermatocytes was twenty-times greater than the minimum effective concentration of u <dig>  however, unlike u <dig>  nem did not cause regression of the cleavage furrow or redistribution of f-actin to the poles of the cell. in addition, the effect of u <dig> on cytokinesis was reversible in crane-fly spermatocytes at the minimum effective concentration  <cit> , whereas the effect of nem was not. in drosophila spermatocytes, on the other hand, nem stopped cleavage furrow ingression at a concentration well below the effective concentration of u <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that nem has more pleiotropic effects. indeed, nem treatment resulted in blebbing of the plasma membrane, an effect not seen after treatment with u <dig>  these observations show that the effects of u <dig> are distinct from those of nem, and suggest that they are due to inhibition of plc by u <dig>  although our data do not rule out a mechanism in which u <dig> inhibits plc by alkylation. effects of other inhibitors strengthen the argument that a plc-dependent pathway is involved in cytokinesis.

a second plc inhibitor, et-18-och <dig>  had effects on cytokinesis similar to u <dig>  et-18-och <dig> is believed to act by inserting into cellular membranes. like u <dig>  et-18-och <dig> caused cleavage furrow regression and redistribution of f-actin to the poles of the cell. these inhibitors have two known overlapping cellular effects: inhibition of plc and release of ca2+ from intracellular stores. in previous experiments using drosophila spermatocytes, we showed that treatments predicted to greatly influence intracellular ca2+ levels had little effect on cytokinesis. treatment of cells with ca2+ ionophores a <dig> or ionomycin did not block cleavage, although they did induce cell contractility and occasional ectopic cell fusion events  <cit> . in contrast, chelation of intracellular ca2+ with the cell permeable chelator bapta-am did block cytokinesis, but only when cells were cultured in buffer lacking ca2+  <cit> . thus, at least drosophila spermatocytes can divide provided they have either an intracellular or an extracellular source of ca2+, rendering it unlikely that any effect of et-18-och <dig> or u <dig> on intracellular ca2+ stores would have blocked cytokinesis in these cells. the simplest explanation for the common effect of u <dig> and et-18-o-ch <dig> is that plc activity is required for cytokinesis.

the requirement for plc activity in cytokinesis appears to be conserved. several mammalian plc isoforms, plcδ <dig>  plcβ <dig> and plcδ <dig>  were found to localize to the cleavage furrows of hela, nih3t <dig> and mdck cells during cytokinesis  <cit> . moreover, plcγ is tyrosine phosphorylated, and presumably activated, in dividing sea urchin embryos  <cit> . u <dig>  which blocks cleavage in sea urchin embryos  <cit> , and et-18-och <dig>  which was originally found to interfere with cytokinesis in transformed cells and tumor cell lines  <cit> , were recently found to inhibit cytokinesis in nih3t <dig> cells  <cit> . although there are currently no genetic studies showing a role for individual plcs in cytokinesis in any system, this is likely due to redundancy, as most organisms contain multiple plcs.

in dividing crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes, two plc inhibitors, u <dig> and et-18-och <dig>  cause cleavage furrow regression . inhibition of plc would be expected to result in an increase in pip <dig>  concomitant with a decrease in the second messengers dag and ip <dig>  pip <dig> is required for cytokinesis in drosophila spermatocytes and mammalian cells  <cit> . however, it is unclear if an increase in pip <dig> would be deleterious to the cell. on the other hand, inhibition of the ip <dig> receptor with 2-apb or chelation of ca2+ with bapta-am blocked continued cleavage in drosophila spermatocytes and zebrafish embryos  <cit> . furthermore, we previously showed that treatment of spermatocytes with a ca2+ ionophore prevented the cells from responding to u <dig>  strongly suggesting ca2+ is a key downstream effector of pip <dig> hydrolysis during cytokinesis  <cit> . effects of the mlck inhibitor ml- <dig> confirm this interpretation.

mlck, a potential target of ca2+ during cytokinesis, phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain on ser- <dig>  and to a lesser extent on thr- <dig>  this diphosphorylation activates non-muscle myosin ii, allowing it to form bipolar thick filaments postulated to constrict f-actin in the contractile ring  <cit> . although recent experiments have focused on roles for other myosin activating kinases, rho kinase and citron kinase, in cytokinesis  <cit> , mlck may also have a crucial role in this process. indeed, treatment of both crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes with the mlck inhibitor ml- <dig> reversibly blocked cytokinesis . similarly, ml- <dig> interferes with cytokinesis in sea urchin embryos  <cit>  and with maintenance of f-actin in the contractile ring in mammalian cells  <cit> . strikingly, ml- <dig> caused cleavage furrow regression and redistribution of actin filaments in a manner similar to u <dig> and et-18-och <dig> . furthermore, treatment with all three inhibitors caused loss of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain  from the equator of the cell. although ml- <dig> is reported to have other targets in vitro , the most straightforward interpretation of our results is that all three inhibitors interfere with cytokinesis by blocking mlck activity, myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation and myosin ii contractility.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that two different plc inhibitors, u <dig> and et-18-och <dig>  have similar effects on cleavage furrow stability, f-actin localization and myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation, indicating a role for plc activity in cleavage furrow ingression. moreover, inhibition of mlck with ml- <dig> affects cytokinesis in a similar manner, suggesting that pip <dig> hydrolysis and ca2+ release stimulate non-muscle myosin ii to maintain actin-myosin interactions and stability of the contractile ring.
