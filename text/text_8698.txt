BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  are peptides that are selectively toxic against microbes. to date, more than  <dig> amps have been discovered in various organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, protozoans, and microbes. the structures of amps are extremely diverse. they are categorized into distinct structural groups such as amphipathic α-helical peptides, and β-sheet peptides stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bridges  <cit> . several amps are already in practical use. for instance, nisin is a widely used food-preservative in more than  <dig> countries including the united states of america, and countries within the european union  <cit> . polymyxin b has been used as a clinical antibiotic for more than half a century  <cit> . many amps have also been investigated for practical use  <cit> . microbial killing by amps is often correlated mainly with membrane disruption although some other intracelluar and extracellular mechanisms also contribute to overall activity  <cit> . several amps such as indolicidin attack intracellular targets without membrane disruption  <cit> .

using combinations of agents is common in a clinical setting in order to obtain more effective antimicrobial properties. such combinatorial application is also effective for amps. conventional low-molecular-mass antimicrobials often exhibit synergistic effects with amps  <cit> . synergy is also observed in some combinations of amps naturally coexisting in the tissues of producing organisms, e.g., magainin  <dig> and pgla  <cit> , different isomers of dermaseptins and temporins  <cit> , cathelicidins and defensins  <cit> , β-defensin and bpi  <cit> , hepcidin and moronecidin  <cit> , cg-prp and cg-def  <cit> , and afp and sarcotoxin ia  <cit> . certain artificial combinations of amps isolated from distinct organisms are synergistic, e.g., some eukaryotic amps and bacteriocins  <cit> , and magainin and tachyplesin i  <cit> . lysozymes,  <dig> -β-n-acetylmurmidases with membrane-perturbing activity, are synergistic with many amps  <cit> . the staphylococcal glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin is also synergistic with polymyxin b and ranalexin  <cit> . all synergies mentioned above are found in combinations of amps and other antimicrobials including amps.

here, we describe potent enhancement of amp activities by a synthetic peptide np4p . increase in positive charge facilitates the interaction of peptides with negatively charged biological membranes, and often results in the conferring of membrane-disrupting or membrane-penetrating activities. we generated some peptides derived from natural non-antimicrobial sequences, with modification to confer a cationic net charge. these peptides were then subjected to screening for novel amps that have structures distinct from those of known amps. np4p was originally one of these peptides. the parent peptide of np4p was a non-antimicrobial peptide fragment, nematode cecropin p <dig> pro-region   <cit> . np4p was generated from p4p by substitution of all acidic amino acid residues with amides , resulting in a reduction of negative charge and an acquisition of stronger net positive charge . it consisted of  <dig> amino acid residues and was highly basic . when evaluating the pharmacological properties of np4p, we found that np4p enhanced the activities of some amps whereas no antimicrobial activity was detected for np4p alone, suggesting that the effect of np4p was an enhancement, but not a synergy as mentioned above. this study is the first report on the unique features of np4p.

RESULTS
evaluation of antimicrobial activity of np4p
antimicrobial activity was evaluated as the first step in pharmacological characterization of np4p. we did not detect antimicrobial activity for np4p at ≤  <dig> μg/ml in growth-inhibitory and microbicidal assay against certain gram-positive bacteria ; gram-negative bacteria ; and yeast , as well as against monkey vero kidney cells . in addition, np4p  did not affect the growth curves of s. aureus ifo <dig>  and e. coli jm <dig> . these results indicate that np4p was less toxic to microbes.

enhancer activity for antimicrobial peptides
the parent peptide p4p inhibited the bactericidal activity of cecropin p <dig> and some other antimicrobial peptides , encouraging us to test whether np4p affected the activities of other antimicrobial agents. we examined the effect of np4p on the bactericidal activities of the nematode csαβ-type cationic amp asabf-α  <cit>  against s. aureus ifo <dig>  and polymyxin b against e. coli jm <dig> in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  . unexpectedly, np4p enhanced these activities at ≥  <dig> μg/ml in a dose-dependent manner. the dose-effect curves of asabf-α and polymyxin b were shifted to almost  <dig> times lower concentration in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml np4p. however, the enhancement was completely abolished in a high ionic strength condition .

furthermore, we tested np4p enhancement at  <dig> μg/ml for the activities of antimicrobial agents against various microbes . the results can be summarized as:  the bactericidal activities of all tested membrane-disrupting amps  were enhanced.  the enhancement was selective depending on the type of bacterial species. for instance, the activities of asabf-α against s. aureus ifo <dig> and e. coli jm <dig> were enhanced, whereas a lesser enhancement was observed against m. luteus ifo  <dig>  b. subtilis ifo <dig>  p. aeruginosa ifo <dig>  and s. marcescens ifo <dig>   np4p did not enhance the activity of one amp indolicidin which killed bacteria by inhibition of dna synthesis and not by membrane disruption  <cit> .  np4p did not affect the activities of conventional antimicrobial agents that do not target bacterial cytoplasmic membranes .

a each mbc value was determined in the presence or absence of  <dig> μg/ml np4p.

b membrane disruptive.

c not membrane disruptive.

effect on disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane
np4p enhancement was observed only for the antimicrobial activities of membrane-disrupting amps. the simplest hypothesis accounting for np4p enhancement was direct facilitation of membrane disruption. to test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of np4p on the activity of bacterial membrane disruption by asabf-α. dis-c3- is a slow-response voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye  <cit> . the extracellularly administered dis-c3- accumulates on the hyperpolarized cell membrane, translocates into the lipid bilayer, and redistributes between the cells and the medium in accordance with the membrane potential. aggregation within the confined membrane interior or intracellular spaces usually results in reduced fluorescence by self-quenching. depolarization or disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane causes the release of dis-c3- from the cells to the medium and an increase in fluorescence intensity. asabf-α evoked the increase in fluorescence against dis-c3--loaded s. aureus ifo <dig> in a dose-dependent manner . asabf-α induced calcein  leakage from the acidic-liposomes , indicating that the increase in fluorescence was attributed to leakage of dis-c3- by membrane disruption rather than redistribution by depolarization. bactercidal activity was parallel to the release of dis-c3- , suggesting that asabf-α killed s. aureus mainly by disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.

the effect of np4p was investigated using this experimental setting. np4p evoked no significant change in fluorescence at ≤  <dig> μg/ml whereas weak ripples or limited increase were observed at higher concentrations  . in addition, np4p did not disrupt the acidic-liposomal membrane at ≤  <dig> μg/ml . this suggests that np4p barely affected either the membrane permeability or membrane potential of s. aureus. to test the effect of np4p on the membrane-disrupting activity of asabf-α, dose-response curves were determined in the presence or absence of np4p . the efficacy of membrane disruption by asabf-α was remarkably enhanced by np4p in a dose-dependent manner. the threshold concentration of asabf-α was not significantly affected. several doses of np4p were added to s. aureus which was intermediately damaged by  <dig>  μg/ml of asabf-α  . even  <dig> μg/ml of np4p caused detectable enhancement. the degree of enhancement increased dose-dependently. these results suggest that np4p enhances the bactericidal activity of asabf-α by increasing the efficacy of membrane disruption.

amps from the skin of a frog, pgla and magainin  <dig>  form heterodimers and show synergistic membrane disruption and antimicrobial activities  <cit> . np4p is not as likely to bind directly with amps as pgla and magainin  <dig> because the structure of asabf-α, nisin, and polymyxin b, whose bactericidal activities were enhanced by np4p, are completely distinct  <cit> . np4p is a highly basic molecule and could interact with negatively charged cytoplasmic membranes. a possible mechanism of np4p enhancement is destabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane. whereas np4p did not exhibit neither growth inhibitory nor bactericidal activity against s. aureus at ≤  <dig> μg/ml, ripples or weak increase in dis-c3- fluorescence was evoked at >  <dig> μg/ml, suggesting that np4p interacted with bacterial cytoplasmic membranes and caused sublethal membrane destabilization. for acidic liposomes, np4p neither evoked such membrane destabilization-like responses nor enhanced membrane disruption of asabf-α. however, the results obtained by quantifying bacterial membrane disruption using using dis-c3- may indicate the more specific mode of action. the intensities of enhancement did not correlate with the susceptibilities of the bacteria for the tested amps. the killing of e. coli jm <dig> was most efficiently enhanced for asabf-α and polymyxin b, suggesting that the efficacy of np4p enhancement depends on the species of bacteria rather than on that of amps. these results support our hypothesis that np4p independently interacts with cytoplasmic membranes and not with amps. for acidic liposomes, membrane disruption of asabf-α was inhibited in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml np4p. the dose-response curve was shifted to a higher concentration , indicating that np4p was a competitive inhibitor. this inhibition could be due to charge neutralization of the membrane surface by np4p binding and prevention of asabf-α binding in a similar manner to that observed between magainin  <dig> and an acyclic tachyplesin i analogue  <cit> , i.e., np4p and asabf-α also bind to the liposomal membrane independently. this observation does not contradict our hypothesis mentioned above. the exact mechanisms for np4p enhancement at the molecular level remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
np4p selectively enhances the bactericidal activities of membrane-disrupting amps . np4p is not bactericidal and does not inhibit growth at ≤  <dig> μg/ml against all tested bacteria, suggesting that the effect of np4p is enhancement and is distinct from the previously reported synergy among amps and/or low-molecular mass antimicrobials  <cit> . enhancement intensities depend on microbial species. relatively good enhancement was achieved for s. aureus and e. coli. increasing the efficacy of membrane disruption against the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane may contribute to enhancement by np4p.

amps are immune effectors against microbial infections in vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. in humans, the deficiency in amp functions often causes reduced resistance against infectious diseases  <cit> , indicating that resistance may increase by enhancing the effect of amps. amp-enhancers without antimicrobial activities are promising as immunopotentiators since they do not disturb the autonomic control of immunity. although salt-inhibition remains to be resolved for practical use in mammals, np4p is believed to be the first peptide which exerts amp-enhancer activity.
