BACKGROUND
the olive mouse abrothrix olivacea
 <cit>  is a cricetid rodent of the
subfamily sigmodontinae, one of the largest mammalian subfamilies with about 400
species and  <dig> living genera [ <dig> 
3]. the olive mouse is distributed
along chile and argentinean patagonia, from 18ºs to 55ºs latitude  <cit> , extending for over  <dig> km latitudinally, and
encompassing a great variety of environments: coastal deserts in the north,
mediterranean scrubs in central chile, valdivian and magallanic forests through the
south of chile and argentina and patagonian steppe towards the atlantic coast.
a. olivacea must withstand the arid chilean
north and the patagonia steppe, as well as the valdivian rain forest with  <dig> mm or
more of annual rainfall  <cit> . given the
striking biotic and abiotic differences among these environments, differences in
thermoregulation and osmoregulation, among other physiological traits, are expected
to occur. higher tolerance to water shortage in populations from xeric habitat has
already been demonstrated  <cit> . on the
basis of variation in morphology, coloration patterns, and more recently dna
sequence data  <cit> , many a.
olivacea subspecies have been described and at least two
phylogeographic breaks have been found along its distribution  <cit> . all these characteristics make a. olivacea a good focal case for the study of
geographical variation in response to environmental variation.

high-throughput sequencing   <cit> 
has a wide range of applications, from clinical  <cit>  to functional studies in genomics  <cit> , molecular ecology  <cit> , and microbial diversity  <cit> . recently, hts has also been used to
characterize transcriptomes of a growing number of non-model species . rna-seq is a cost-effective way to obtain large amounts of
coding sequences and information about gene expression levels  <cit> . the goal of covering entire genome or
transcriptomes, along with the reduction of the hts costs  <cit> , has motivated digital normalization strategies
 <cit>  to systematize the increasing
but uneven coverage in shotgun sequencing datasets. normalization methods estimate
the read abundance, regardless of a reference, using the k-mer median abundance of
that read and then decides whether to reject or accept it based on the chosen
coverage value  <cit> . in this manner, normalization algorithms
remove redundant reads but also greatly reduce the total number of k-mers by
discarding the majority of the erroneous ones. for example, with a sequencing base
error rate of 1bp per  <dig> bp sequenced  <cit> , k erroneous k-mers will be produced, being k equal to k-mers
size. this data and error reduction notably decreases the computational requirements
for de novo assembly.

in this study, we adopted paired-end illumina sequencing to characterize the
kidney transcriptome of a. olivacea. we chose
kidney because of its association with multiple physiological processes, including
water conservation  <cit>  and nutrition
 <cit> . this transcriptome will serve
as a reference for comparative studies of geographical variation within this
species, as well as for other studies on the diverse sigmodontine rodents. more than
 <dig> million  reads were generated for  <dig> kidney transcriptomes of individuals
sampled across chile and argentina. we explored
various normalization strategies in order to obtain the best transcripts
reconstruction and identify the most expressed genes. this is the first report of a
sigmodontine transcriptome.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembly
transcriptome sequencing of  <dig> libraries using illumina yielded a total
of ~  <dig> gb of data, formed by ~ <dig> m of paired reads with an average length of 101
bp .
trimming of low quality bases from the 3' end, prior to trinity  <cit>  de novo
assembly, reduced average read length to  <dig> bp. the number of reconstructed
contigs per library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; with average length ranging
from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and median from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . detailed results for each library are shown in additional

to obtain a good reference transcriptome, we also explored three strategies:
 combining reads of all libraries ,  trinity's in silico normalization   <cit> , and  digital normalization 
 <cit> . the last two strategies
involve, in order to improve assembly efficiency from high coverage sequencing
datasets, the deletion of redundant reads, ideally without harming the quality of
the final reconstructed genes. of these two, trinitynorm was more severe than
diginorm in reducing the total number of paired-ends reads from ~ <dig> m to ~ <dig> m
vs. ~ <dig> m . meanwhile, digital
normalization was faster than in silico trinity
normalization:  <dig> hours vs.  <dig> hours.

as expected, the multireads strategy led to a far more time consuming and
computationally demanding assembly than either of the normalization methods, being
five and over nine times slower than the assembly from diginorm and trinity,
respectively . also, the average
and median lengths of reconstructed contigs from the multireads data set were
smaller than the assembled contigs from normalized reads, with  <dig>  and  <dig> bp
for mulitreads,  <dig>  and  <dig> bp for trinitynorm, and  <dig>  and  <dig> bp for
diginorm. these results are consistent with the distribution of the contigs, where
almost half  of the reconstructed contigs from the multireads strategy were
between  <dig> and  <dig> bp . on the other hand, the multireads strategy
reconstructed the longest contigs  with  <dig>  above  <dig>  bp. trinitynorm and diginorm
reconstructed only  <dig>  and  <dig>  of contigs above this length,
respectively.

the two normalization strategies produced similar assembly results in terms of
average and median length of contigs, with a small advantage for diginorm values,
but they significantly differed in the number of contigs assembled, diginorm
assembled  <dig>  more contigs than trinitynorm and  <dig>  more than the multireads
strategy .

gene annotation and evaluation of reconstructed coding sequences
annotation was based on blastx searches against:  oma browser mouse protein
database, which contains the protein isoforms of mus
musculus genes  <cit>  and
 ncbi non-redundant vertebrate protein database. for the two databases the
same e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> was set. for the multireads, trinitynorm and
diginorm strategies, each assembled transcript was also analyzed through the pfam
database  <cit>  using hmmer
 <cit>  for proteins domain identification. a file summarizing the
pfam and blastx results for each of the three strategies is available as
additional file  <dig> 

the maximum number of mouse genes annotated within a particular library was
 <dig>  from the significant hits of  <dig>  contigs of the  <dig>  assembled
. the union of the  <dig> individual blastx runs only added  <dig>  significant hits
, indicating the high level of redundant information across
libraries. on the other hand, when using the extensive non-redundant vertebrate
database as reference, the maximum number of contigs annotated within a single
library was  <dig> ,  <dig> contigs more than with the oma database . detailed results for
each library are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  hereafter we present the results based only on mouse
proteins from oma. this database allow us to count the number of genes and their
corresponding reconstructed coding sequences  and obtain an upper bound
estimation of genes orthologous with mouse.table  <dig>

of the  <dig>  mouse genes annotated through the union of all libraries, almost
one half  had at least one putative cds reconstructed at > 99%,  <dig> 
at > 90%, and  <dig>  at > 80%, of the total expected length. more
importantly, in total,  <dig>  distinct mouse isoforms of the  <dig>  
available at oma browser were almost fully reconstructed  for a. olivacea .

among the three strategies carried out to obtain a reference transcriptome,
multireads reached the lowest number of mouse genes,  <dig> ; meanwhile trininorm
and diginorm, reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. despite having found the
lowest number of genes, the multireads strategy performed best at reconstructing
coding sequences, obtaining similar values to those gathered through the union of
the single libraries, with  <dig> distinct mouse coding sequences reconstructed
at > 99%,  <dig>  at > 90%, and  <dig>  at > 80% . with regard to genes, of the  <dig>  annotated by
the multireads alternative, 47% had at least one cds fully 
reconstructed, clearly surpassing the 39% and 34% of trinitynorm and diginorm
respectively . between the two
normalization strategies, trinitynorm outperformed diginorm at each reconstruction
level in terms of numbers of mouse genes found and percentage of coding sequence
reconstructed . on the other hand, the
assembly from diginorm had more contigs at each level of reconstruction and also
more contigs with at least one pfam domain, followed by trininorm and the
multireads strategies . this is
expected if those contigs represent distinct fragments of the same coding sequence
or if they are isotigs  representing  distinct
isoforms. however, when the number of potential isoforms from trinity assembly
were inferred and counted , the average number of alternative
reconstructions per contig was  <dig>  for diginorm and only  <dig>  for the multireads
strategy . thus, those contigs are alternative reconstruction
 representing  isoforms and not subfragments of a given
reference.figure  <dig>

levels. frequency of genes annotated per total number of
genes were calculated for each strategy  and for the
corresponding mouse coding sequences  reconstruction level. the cds
reconstruction intervals are of  <dig>  percent. only the largest
reconstructed cds for each gene are taken into account.



functional annotation
for the functional annotation of the transcriptome, we selected the genes
found by trinitynorm. this strategy was the one with the best tradeoff between cds
reconstructed, genes found, and computational speed. to this end, the database for
annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit> , was used to classify them with gene
ontology  terms.

for the  <dig>  genes found by trinitynorm strategy,  <dig>  go terms were
categorized in biological processes,  <dig>  in molecular function and  <dig>  in
cellular components. most genes at biological processes belong either to
“regulation of transcription” , “transcription”  and to “regulation
of rna metabolic process”  . likewise, the molecular function category subdivided
annotated sequences into “ion binding” , “cation binding” , and
“metal ion binding”  as the most represented . within the category cellular component, the three
principal groups were: “intrinsic to membrane” , “integral to membrane”
 and “plasma membrane”  .figure  <dig>

trinitynorm strategy. results are summarized in three main
categories: biological process, molecular function, and celullar

the most expressed genes
to determine the most expressed genes in the a.
olivacea kidney transcriptome, tpm  expression values were calculated for each
single library with rsem software  <cit> . for this purpose, a set with 5% of most expressed genes  for each of the  <dig> transcriptomes was identified; these were cross searched
to identify those genes common to all libraries. two hundred eighty-three genes
resulted to be present in all libraries . the average tpm values ranged from
 <dig> to  <dig>  . five genes that showed the highest average tpm values were: predicted gene
 <dig>  , glutathione
peroxidase  <dig> , ferritin heavy chain  <dig> ,
hemoglobin beta adult major chain , and phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase  <dig> cytosolic  .

go terms for the  <dig> genes obtained from david showed that the most enriched
terms among the three domains using the trinitynorm genes list as background were:
“hydrogen ion transporting atp synthase activity, rotational mechanism” , “proton-transporting atp synthase
complex”  and “mitochondrial atp
synthesis coupled electron transport” 
.

subsequently, these  <dig> genes were cross-checked with a list obtained from
pradervand et al.  <cit> , who enumerated the most expressed genes in
the distal part of the mouse renal tubule using microarrays. seventeen genes
resulted to be in common : two transcription factors, one small
gtpase, eight transporters and channels, and six cytoskeleton-related genes. among
these genes are aquaporin  <dig> , ras-related
protein rab-7a ,
sodium/potassium-transporting atpase gamma chain , voltage-dependent anion channel  <dig> , and guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha stimulating
.

discussion
the subfamily sigmodontinae includes about  <dig> species and  <dig> living genera
 <cit> . of these, a. olivacea
inhabits a wide range of contrasting environments and presents different geographic
forms. in this work,  <dig> individuals were sampled in argentina and chile, covering
both the arid patagonian steppe and the wet valdivian and magellanic forests. more
than  <dig> m reads were generated in what constitutes the first characterization of a
sigmodontine transcriptome. in addition, we present a set of highly expressed genes
of which some are possible candidates for ecological studies of the response of the
species to environmental variation in water and dietary items availability.

transcriptome sequencing and assembly
as the cost of high-throughput sequencing falls and more cdna sequences are
generated, the importance of appropriate normalization strategies prior to contig
assembling increases. in this study, we used two normalization strategies and
compared their performance with a non-normalized  alternative.

in terms of length and number of contigs assembled regardless of the strategy,
our results were similar to those found in previous studies in which trinity was
used  <cit> . among the three strategies, if only contigs
descriptive statistics are taken into account, the assembly after both
normalization strategies clearly outperformed the multireads approach.
normalizations not only showed the largest average and mean contig lengths but
also ran considerably faster than the multireads counterpart. this is a
consequence of discarding reads that are considered to be redundant and the
concomitant sequencing error removal. if transcriptome coverage is moderate, it is
necessary to keep in mind that, as noted by brown et
al.  <cit> , the memory
requirements will be roughly the same, with or without normalization, due to
limited removal of erroneous k-mers.

gene annotation and evaluation of reconstructed coding sequences
to evaluate the capacity of each strategy to assembly the a. olivacea transcriptome, we quantified the number of
contigs that resulted to be homologs of mouse oma proteins at different
reconstruction levels. we found that the multireads strategy performs the best for
the > 99%, >  <dig> and > 80% of the total mouse cds length and obtained the
most similar values to those found through the union of the individual sets of
contigs. even though the multireads strategy produced the assembly with smaller
median and mean contig sizes, larger contigs were reconstructed , thus explaining the
better results obtained for the cds reconstruction. therefore, studies that
require complete reconstruction of coding sequences should avoid normalization;
but obviously, when billions of reads are available for assembly, the multireads
approach becomes prohibitive and normalization is the only way to proceed. these
results are consistent with those found by  <cit> ; it seems that normalization generates a more fragmented
assembly, at least when trinity is used. our results are consistent with the
notion that fragmentation is a by-product of normalization, but also that
normalization negatively impacts the completeness of the coding sequences
reconstruction at all levels. for both normalization methods a k =  <dig>  was
set, and it is not clear why such fragmentation is produced.

if assembly capacity and computational requirements are considered, we
consider that assembly from trinitynorm has the best cost-benefit return. this
strategy was second after multireads in number of genes reconstructed for each
category while using about 1/ <dig> of the time. moreover, a high number of putative
isoforms were reconstructed, supported by the number of contigs reconstructed per
category  and the isotigs counted
from trinity assembly . even though diginorm reached the largest
number of isotigs and the highest number of genes, its performance at
reconstructing full and almost full cds was the worst and very similar to the best
single library. also, the assembly from diginorm was two times slower than that
from trinitynorm. the latter required more time for normalization but is capable
of running multithreading and so outperforms diginorm.

regardless of the strategy, a large number of homologous mouse genes were
obtained in our study. according to microarray studies  <cit>  , about
 <dig> genes are expressed in the kidneys of adult humans; meanwhile, recent hts
transcriptome studies found  <dig>  for the baboon kidneys  <cit> . clearly, in this study we were able to find
almost the same number of genes  that spradling
et al.  <cit>  even though we used a very stringent e-value for the blastx
analysis. moreover, of those genes,  <dig> % had at least one full  cds
reconstructed. given that, we reconstructed  <dig>  distinct mouse isoforms out of
 <dig>   for at least 90% of the total expected length, we established an
important set of sequences, likely orthologous to mouse genes, which will be
useful for future analyses of molecular evolution, population genomics, and
phylogenetics.

list of most expressed genes
the assessment of gene differential expression tends to be problematic for
contigs with low counts  <cit> ;
therefore, a good strategy is establishing a set of highly expressed genes for
directing efforts to study differential expression. in this work,  <dig> transcriptome
libraries were used to identify the most expressed genes of the kidneys of
a. olivacea. some of them had already been
described for model species, while many of the new ones have a clear relationship
with renal function and could serve as potential candidates for future
evolutionary and ecological genomic studies.

seventeen of  <dig> most expressed genes found in this work were previously
singled out by pradervand et al.  <cit>  using microarrays in the distal part of the
mouse renal tubule. although for some of these genes their precise function is not
clear, for others knowledge on their function is reasonably good. for example,
aqp <dig> is involved in water reabsorption at the
apical and basolateral plasma membrane of the proximal tubule  <cit> ; mutations in fxyd <dig> have been associated with renal hypomagnesemia- <dig>  <cit> ; rab <dig>  as
a rab member, could be implicated in the transport, docking, and fusion of
endocytotic vesicles  <cit> , and
finally, gnas codifies the alpha subunit of
heterotrimeric g proteins, which mediates the vasopressin receptor type 2
signaling after the binding with vasopressin, and ultimately increases water
reabsorption in the collecting duct  <cit> . in our expression analysis, fxyd <dig> and aqp <dig> are among the top
 <dig> and top  <dig> of the most expressed genes, respectively. the latter represents a
good candidate gene for the study of differential responses to variation of
environmental water availability.

among the  <dig> remaining highly expressed genes, additional putative candidates
associated with renal function were found; for example: i) kallikrein  encodes a proteolytic protein which produces the
kinin proteins, which may counteract the hydrosmotic effect of vasopressin
 <cit> ; ii) uromodulin  encodes the most abundant protein in urine
 <cit> , and mouse knockouts for this
gene have shown urine concentration problems  <cit> ; iii) glyoxylate reductase , an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of glyoxylate to
glycolate, is associated with a disorder that can cause nephrolithiasis , nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure  <cit> ; and iv)
sorbitol dehydrogenase , along with
aldose reductase, are possibly involved in osmoregulation in the kidney
 <cit> .

regarding the go-term classification, no important differences were found
between the set of all genes and the  <dig> most expressed ones, except that an
expected excess of mitochondrial related go-terms was found among the latter
. this
enrichment is not surprising as the kidney is an energetically demanding organ
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in order to obtain the best-reconstructed transcripts from the kidney of the
olive mouse a. olivacea on the basis of 13
individual libraries, we first explored three alternative assembling strategies.
results indicate that the trinity's in silico
normalization is the best algorithm in terms of cost-benefit return. we annotated
more than  <dig>  genes that were almost fully reconstructed, calculated their
expression levels, and identified the most expressed ones. various genes involved in
water conservation in mouse models under laboratory conditions were reconstructed
and showed high expression levels in a. olivacea,
demonstrating the value of rna-seq technology. given that this work is the first to
characterize the transcriptome of any member of sigmodontinae, a subfamily of
cricetid rodents with about  <dig> species, it will provide valuable resources for
future ecological genomics and evolutionary analyses and will serve as assembly
reference for a large number of species. in particular, it will facilitate the study
of variation in levels of gene expression in the olive mouse and other sigmodontines
that occupy a wide range of environmental conditions—from aridlands to temperate
rainforests—in south america.
