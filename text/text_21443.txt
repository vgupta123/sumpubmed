BACKGROUND
barley is among the oldest crop species human civilization was built on. approximately  <dig>  years ago, barley was domesticated in the fertile crescent  <cit> , presumably followed by additional independent domestication events in east asia  <cit> . domestication and subsequent genetic selection led to gene erosion in most crop species’ gene pools  <cit> , threatening future breeding advances. utilizing the untapped biodiversity, present in wild progenitors is one promising approach to replenish the elite breeding pool with new favorable alleles  <cit> . the enriched diversity may be pivotal to boost the rate of genetic improvement and to cope with the anticipated enhanced effects of biotic and abiotic stresses due to climate change.

in this regard, time of flowering is expected to play a major role in future crop improvement. it is a key trait for the successful completion of a plant’s life cycle and, therefore, it has a strong impact on grain yield  <cit> . flowering time indicates the transition from vegetative to reproductive stage, which is mainly influenced by environmental cues like day length  and prolonged exposure to cold temperatures . in barley, the day length determining light signal is transmitted from a circadian clock oscillator, with ppd-h <dig>  a pseudo-response regulator  <dig>  gene, in its center  <cit> . under long day condition, ppd-h <dig>  through mediation of constans , promotes the expression of the floral inducer vrn-h <dig>  a homolog of the arabidopsis thaliana flowering locus t  gene  <cit> . on the other hand, vrn-h <dig>  a zinc-finger constans, co-like and toc <dig> -domain protein  acts as a repressor of vrn-h <dig>  <cit> . vrn-h <dig>  in turn, is repressed by vrn-h <dig>  an apetala <dig> family mads-box transcription factor  <cit> , which is up-regulated during vernalization. thus, after vernalization, the repression of vrn-h <dig> is abolished and flowering is induced. based on its vernalization requirement, winter barley and spring barley can be distinguished. spring barley lacks the vernalization requirement due to a deletion of vrn-h <dig>  <cit> .

besides photoperiod and vernalization, there are also genetic mechanisms acting independently of environmental cues, so-called earliness per se  <cit> . although several key regulatory cereal genes of flowering time were characterized and finally cloned during the last two decades, still little is known about the genetic architecture underlying flowering time regulation in temperate cereals, as compared to the model species a. thaliana  <cit> . so far, a holistic explanation of flowering time in a segregating germplasm population and the accurate prediction of a plant’s time of flowering, based on the combined action and interaction of major genes, is still not fully achieved in cereal species. furthermore, it is reported that wild barley accessions possess a rich reservoir of beneficial alleles controlling flowering time  <cit> .

nested association mapping  emerged as a multi-parental mapping design to investigate genomic regions with unprecedented genetic resolution and allelic variation by combining the advantages of linkage analysis and association mapping  <cit> . hence, it facilitates the elucidation of a trait’s genetic architecture via genome-wide association study . until now, the nam design was applied to the allogamous species maize and sorghum  <cit> . nam populations for autogamous species like barley or wheat have not been developed, yet. in maize, the genetic dissection of various agronomic traits, including flowering time, has been investigated  <cit> . however, it was not possible to completely dissect the genetic architecture of flowering time in maize due to its complex inheritance and the multitude of involved small effect qtl. we developed the first nam population in the autogamous species barley, termed ‘halle exotic barley 25’ . the population results from initial crosses between the spring barley elite cultivar barke  and  <dig> highly divergent exotic barley accessions, contributing an ideal instrument to study biodiversity. the exotic donors comprise  <dig> wild barley accessions of h. vulgare ssp. spontaneum , the progenitor of domesticated barley, and one tibetian h. vulgare ssp. agriocrithon  accession. barke was selected since it was also used as a parent of a barley high-resolution mapping population  <cit>  and as a genetic stock for mutation screening  <cit> . the exotic donors were selected from badr et al.  <cit>  to represent a substantial part of the genetic diversity that is present across the fertile crescent, where barley domestication occurred. to generate the nested population, f <dig> plants were backcrossed to barke and, subsequently, selfed three times . in total, heb- <dig> consists of  <dig>  bc1s <dig> lines, divided into  <dig> heb families of up to  <dig> lines per family .figure  <dig> development of the nested association mapping population heb- <dig>  heb- <dig> is made of  <dig> families with  <dig>  nam lines in bc1s <dig>  per nam line, one chromosome pair is illustrated as a double bar. black and colored bars represent chromosome segments originating from barke and the exotic donor accessions, respectively. at each snp locus, heb- <dig> is expected to segregate into  <dig> % homozygous barke,  <dig> % heterozygous and  <dig> % homozygous donor genotypes.



in the present study we investigated the genetic architecture of flowering time in barley. for this purpose, the nam population heb- <dig> was grown from  <dig> to  <dig> in multi-field trials to gather data on flowering time. by combining these data with high-density snp marker information via genome-wide association studies and genomic prediction models, we could show that flowering time in barley mainly depends on a low number of large-effect qtl and epistatic interactions.

RESULTS
characterization of heb-25
the inheritance of parental segments across the genomes of the  <dig>  heb lines was characterized through genotyping  <dig>  informative, genic single nucleotide polymorphism  markers  <cit> . marker saturation was high with an average genetic distance of  <dig>  cm and a maximum gap of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. linkage disequilibrium  among the  <dig> parents decayed rapidly  enabling a high mapping resolution  <cit> . the snp data revealed a low degree of genetic similarity between barke and the donors, ranging from  <dig> to 54% . parents and the heb- <dig> population could be clearly separated in a principal component analysis  . also, heb families could be ordered in the pca based on their geographical origin. these findings point to the high genetic diversity that is present among heb- <dig> and its parents.

diversity in heb- <dig> was also visible phenotypically. during the seasons  <dig> through  <dig>  heb- <dig> was cultivated at the halle university experimental field station to collect flowering time data. the heb lines flowered on average  <dig>  days after sowing with a range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  days and a standard deviation of  <dig>  days . the broad variation in flowering time, covering almost 50 days among the  <dig>  heb lines, and a high heritability of  <dig> %, as well as the genetic properties of the nam population provided an excellent starting point to study the genetic architecture of flowering time through gwas.

genome-wide association study
for gwas, we initially applied the multiple linear regression model-b with step-wise selection of cofactors, as outlined in liu et al.  <cit> . model-b was found most suitable to study traits across multiple related families  <cit> , where a family effect and additional snps, selected as cofactors, are included in the model. gwas revealed eight highly significant major qtl regions controlling flowering time with pbon-holm <  <dig>  e- <dig> . testing the combined explanatory power of the single peak markers of the eight major qtl revealed a cross-validated explained proportion of genotypic variance  of 64% . to check if genetic relatedness, as reported elsewhere  <cit> , affects this parameter in heb- <dig>  we also estimated pg for different sets of eight randomly chosen snps, excluding regions with significant qtl. however, since the cross-validated explained pg remained low with an average of 8%, we conclude that genetic relatedness between individual lines does not play a major role in heb- <dig>  this emphasizes the power and precision of qtl detection in heb- <dig>  which may be a combined effect of the low extent of ld and the particular mating design, resulting in an elevated rate of chromosomal recombination. thus, flowering time of barley can be reliably predicted based on eight major qtl. this finding is in contrast to flowering time regulation in the allogamous species maize and sorghum, where only small effect minor qtl were detected  <cit> . the most significant association in heb- <dig>  was observed on the short arm of chromosome 2h and explained a pg of 36%. this snp is directly located within ppd-h <dig>  the major determinant of photoperiod response in barley under long day condition  <cit> . seven further genomic regions of extraordinary high significance were detected on chromosome arms 1hl, 2hs, 3hl, 4hs, 4hl, 5hl, and 7hs. all except one qtl  could be assigned to known flowering time genes . besides ppd-h <dig>  also the vernalization genes vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig>  as well as the floral inducer vrn-h <dig> and its putative paralog hvcen  <cit>  exhibited highly significant effects. in addition, we could confirm the importance of gibberellic acid  in flowering time regulation  <cit>  through detection of denso  <cit>  and hvelf <dig>  <cit>  as two further major qtl. both genes are shown to be involved in ga biosynthesis  <cit> . so far, only the qtl on 4hs could not been referenced. this qtl, thus, remains a subject for further genetic investigations.table  <dig>

the eight major qtl were located with high genetic precision, with four qtl restricted to confidence intervals of less than  <dig>  cm . in cases where gene-specific snps were available , exactly those snps revealed the highest significance within the respective qtl window . the exotic alleles at ppd-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig> revealed the strongest effects, accelerating flowering time by  <dig>  days and delaying flowering time by  <dig>  days, respectively. the drastic effects of single qtl outline the high potential of introducing wild barley alleles from heb- <dig> in order to adapt flowering time to environmental requirements and to enhance biodiversity in the elite barley breeding pool.

ppd-h <dig> haplotype study
as we used bi-allelic snp markers, additive effects were estimated across the nam population. theoretically, there may be up to  <dig> different alleles present at each locus in heb- <dig>  thus, distinct alleles that show contrasting effects between families potentially escaped detection in our snp-based gwas. contrasting effects are illustrated in figure  <dig> and, in detail, in additional file  <dig>  for instance, snps at position  <dig>  cm on chromosome 3h, which are tightly linked to hvgi  <cit> , revealed opposing effects across heb families. we tested the potential to integrate snp haplotypes in the gwas model for ppd-h <dig>  which exhibited the largest pg. after re-sequencing the last two exons and three introns of ppd-h <dig>  twelve haplotypes could be distinguished . all hsp donor haplotypes at ppd-h <dig> showed a significantly reduced flowering time , where a maximum reduction of flowering time was associated with h- <dig> . only the hag haplotype h- <dig> did not differ from h- <dig>  this finding confirms the presence of haplotype-specific effects present in heb- <dig>  consequently, we expect the existence of further haplotype effects for other candidate genes controlling flowering time. the haplotype-based ppd-h <dig> model resulted in a slight increase of the cross-validated explained pg from 36% to 38%. this finding implies that modelling haplotype-specific effects for a substantial portion of the barley gene space may result in an improved prediction of flowering time in heb- <dig>  however, a genome-wide re-sequencing of heb- <dig> lines will be required to identify and distinguish those haplotypes.figure  <dig> visualization of family-wise snp effects. barley chromosomes are indicated as inner circle of colored bars, centromeres are highlighted as transparent boxes. grey connector lines represent the genetic position of snps on chromosomes. each track displays one heb family . the heatmap indicates the difference in days between the donor and barke genotype. blue and red colors specify early and late flowering, respectively, caused by the donor genotype. white color indicates no snp effect or snps monomorphic in the respective family. candidate genes  are indicated outside the circle. black frames highlight their family-specific effects as indicated in additional file  <dig> 



applying genomic prediction models
to check whether we could further elucidate the genetic architecture of barley flowering time we applied genomic prediction models that considered all markers simultaneously. genomic prediction evolved in animal breeding as a tool to predict a phenotype based on modelling a large set of snp data  <cit> . it is used for selection of improved genotypes based on estimated genomic breeding values. applying rr-blup  <cit>  and bayescπ  <cit>  models, we could further increase the cross-validated explained pg to 71% and 74%, respectively . these findings are in agreement with comparisons of multiple linear regression and genomic prediction of traits in bi-parental plant populations  <cit> . however, our pg values substantially exceed the prediction accuracies of genomic prediction models reported in comparable studies  <cit> , underlining the tremendous predictive power of heb- <dig>  interestingly, compared to gwas, only a few additional loci had non-zero effects in the bayescπ model, indicating that flowering time is indeed mainly controlled by the eight major loci detected via gwas.

we assume that important reasons for the slightly higher explained pg of genomic prediction compared to gwas are that minor qtl effects and marginally existing genetic relatedness  <cit>  among heb lines may be better modeled in the first case. furthermore, modeling all makers simultaneously enables a better prediction of flowering time due to the estimation of family-specific qtl effects. this is indicated by the occurrence of opposing additive effects between heb families alongside tightly linked snps .

a model including epistasis to maximize the cross-validated explained pg
a final increase of the cross-validated explained pg to an extraordinary high level of 77% was achieved by including di-genic epistatic interactions between significant main effect snps in the rr-blup model. this finding indicates that epistasis explains a portion of the ‘missing heritability’  <cit>  of flowering time regulation in barley, whereas in maize it does not  <cit> . the term ‘missing heritability’ is highly debated in quantitative genetics and refers to the observation that the explained genotypic variance of combined marker effects is usually lower than the heritability of the trait. epistatic interactions between candidate genes may point to functional relationships and genetic networks  <cit> . our findings indicate that the flowering time genes hvgi, vrn-h <dig>  vrn-h <dig> and hvco <dig>  <cit>  on chromosomes 3h, 4h, 5h and 7h, respectively, are probably major players of di-genic epistatic interactions in heb- <dig>  all four genes potentially interact with each other as well as with further genes on additional chromosomes . these observations are in agreement with independent studies in barley and a. thaliana where these interacting genes were placed in a day length and temperature depending signaling network that controls flowering time  <cit> . it is, thus, likely that the observed interaction between the chromosomal regions in heb- <dig> may be a function of the mentioned flowering time genes. as an example we refer to the potential interaction found between vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig>  epistatic interactions between these loci were already reported  <cit>  and support the model that vrn-h <dig> is a long-day suppressor of flowering, that is itself suppressed by vrn-h <dig> following vernalization  <cit> . barke is a spring type barley cultivar that lacks the vernalization requirement due to a deletion of vrn-h <dig>  <cit> . hence, our findings may indicate that the epistatic interaction found between the two regions on chromosomes 4h and 5h is based on the presence  or absence  of vrn-h <dig>  the target of vrn-h <dig>  in general, the epistatic interactions detected in heb- <dig> may provide hints for the presence of so far unknown functional networks of genes, which assist in fine-tuning flowering time in barley. studies with knock out lines of these genes may be used to validate the observed interaction effects.

CONCLUSIONS
the first barley nam population heb- <dig> provides great opportunities for future research and breeding. the genetic constitution of heb- <dig> allows to carry out detailed studies on the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits, as exemplified by flowering time. the present study substantiated that flowering time in barley is primarily determined by large-effect qtl and epistatic interactions. this finding is in contrast to flowering time regulation in the allogamous species maize and sorghum, where only small effect minor qtl were detected  <cit> , indicating that the mating system may control the genetic architecture of adaptive traits  <cit> .

in future, the nam population heb- <dig> will be utilized in two directions: on the one hand, heb- <dig> may support elucidating the genetic architecture of quantitatively inherited agronomic traits, ultimately resulting in cloning of yet unknown causal genes. on the other hand, heb- <dig> will be exploited by breeders to enhance biodiversity of the elite barley gene pool. this may occur through introgression of favorable wild alleles with the aim to sustainably increase yield and stress tolerances against disadvantageous climate conditions like drought, heat and salt.
