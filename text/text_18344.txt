BACKGROUND
microglia are the main immune effectors of the cns contributing to developmental processes and in the adult to metabolite removal, trophic support through the secretion of growth factors and to the clearance of toxic factors and debris
 <cit> . in response to injury or disease microglia proliferate and transform into active ‘brain macrophages’ to combat pathology and provide neuro-protection
 <cit> . however, in this chronically activated state microglial-derived mediators can become detrimental to neuronal survival if the activating signal and thus inflammatory mediator secretion persists.

wnt proteins are a family of cysteine rich glycoproteins that play a role during development and in tumorigenesis and have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of alzheimer’s disease ; a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterised by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid  plaques
 <cit> . there are  <dig> human wnt genes, several of which encode alternatively-spliced isoforms, which are emerging to play diverse roles in the adult cns
 <cit> . there are three main branches to the wnt signaling system: the β-catenin/gsk <dig> pathway, the planar cell polarity pathway and the wnt/ca2+ pathway. recently, it has been shown that wnt3a can induce β-catenin signaling in n13-microglial-like cells
 <cit> . in addition to these well characterised wnt signaling cascades there are other wnt pathways emerging including the wnt-rap <dig>  wnt-pka, wnt-ryk, wnt-apkc, wnt-gsk <dig> microtubule signaling, wntror <dig> and the wnt-mtor pathways
 <cit> . wnt proteins initiate signaling through binding frizzled. ten frizzled isoforms  have been identified in humans and mouse microglia have been shown to express fzd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as well as the frizzled co-receptors lrp5/6
 <cit> . signal specificity is complex, but may be achieved through cell specific expression of frizzled isoforms, which form homo/hetero-oligomers with different affinities for wnt ligands or through the association of frizzled with different combinations of co-receptor
 <cit> .

a number of extracellular membrane-bound vesicles have been identified to date including exosomes , microvesicles, membrane particles and apoptotic blebs
 <cit> . extracellular vesicles are present in a number of physiological fluids including csf
 <cit> , urine, amniotic fluid, saliva and blood
 <cit> . functions of extracellular vesicles are varied and include inter-cellular communication through the transmission of proteins, mrna and mirna, the removal of defective or effete proteins, antigen presentation and the formation of morphogen gradients
 <cit> . extracellular vesicles are also involved in the propagation of tumors as well as viral and prion infections. furthermore, aβ is secreted in exosomes, exosomal proteins accumulate in aβ plaques in ad
 <cit>  and insulin-degrading enzyme can act to degrade aβ inside exosomes
 <cit> . exosomes derived from neuronal-like cells have also been found to contain α-synuclein, a hallmark pathological feature of parkinson’s disease, and application of such vesicles to neurons confers cytotoxicity
 <cit> . this suggests that exosomal signaling might play important, but as yet incompletely understood roles in the cns.

exosomes form within sorting endosomes giving rise to multi-vesicular endosomes 
 <cit> . multi-vesicular endosomes subsequently fuse with the plasma membrane releasing exosomes or multi-vesicular endosomes are directed to lysosomes for degradation. secretory vesicles might also form within other organelles generating exosome-like vesicles.

in this study we sought to investigate the effects of wnt3a on the secretions from primary rat microglia considering the important roles that microglia and wnt both play in development and in neurological disease. interestingly, we found that primary microglia secreted exosomes following stimulation with wnt3a. in contrast, primary cortical neurons released such vesicles in a constitutive manner. microglial-derived exosomes were approximately  <dig> nm in diameter and contained a variety of ontologically different proteins; some of which have been reported to be present in exosomes derived from other cell types.

RESULTS
proteomic analysis of exosomes secreted by wnt3a treated microglia
tissue culture medium harvested from primary rat microglia treated with carrier-free wnt3a  and centrifuged at 100000xg contained proteins characteristic of exosomes as demonstrated by proteomic profiling . conversely, medium collected from control microglia and centrifuged at 100000xg was completely devoid of any detectable protein as shown by coomassie staining of one dimensional sds-page gels . the concentration of exosomal proteins present in the extracellular fluid represents approximately  <dig> % of total cellular protein. the concentration of wnt3a used  caused a robust activation of topflash, a reporter gene construct containing tandem repeats of optimal tcf/lef binding sites , indicating that the recombinant wnt3a protein was active and able to signal through the β-catenin/gsk <dig> dependent pathway. lot to lot variability in the ability of wnt3a to induce exosome secretion was not observed as has been documented for other wnt3a induced signaling events
 <cit> . western blotting corroborated proteomic findings showing that the 100000xg exosomal fraction contained wnt3a and β-actin . smaller vesicles were also isolated by a subsequent centrifugation step at 200000xg. western blotting demonstrated the presence of wnt3a, β-actin and apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein  in the 200000xg fraction . in contrast, alix was not detectable in the 100000xg exosomal fraction  <dig> hours post wnt3a stimulation. however,  <dig> hours post wnt3a treatment alix could be detected by western blotting in the 100000xg fraction when the number of donor microglia was increased  <dig> fold .

microglia  were treated with wnt3a  for  <dig> hours in sfm. cell culture medium was collected, centrifuged at 10000xg for  <dig> minutes, concentrated using 3kda centrifugal devices and exosomes were isolated at 100000xg. exosomal proteins were separated by sds-page % and visualised using coomassie blue. the exosomal proteome was subsequently interrogated using lc/ms/ms and database searching. proteins are listed according to their molecular weight and the number of peptides matched per protein is presented along with protein function.

neither wnt5a or wnt5b  caused the release of lipid-bound vesicles from microglia,  <dig> hours post treatment, as demonstrated by two dimensional gel electrophoresis  followed by silver staining. silver staining provides a more sensitive method for the detection of protein than staining with coomassie blue . furthermore, other modulators of gsk <dig> activity, used at physiologically relevant concentrations, including lithium , insulin , dkk <dig> , sonic hedgehog  or reelin  did not elicit exosome release or the release of smaller lipid-bound vesicles from microglia .

effects of wnt3a on the inflammatory profile of microglia
control microglia or microglia treated with wnt3a for  <dig>  or  <dig> hours  did not secrete gm-csf, ifn-γ, il1α, il1β, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> or tnfα. in contrast, lps  treated microglia secreted tnfα and il1β, the archetypal pro-inflammatory cytokines, at both of these time points. wnt3a treated microglia did not express inducible nitric oxide synthase  after  <dig> hours in culture as demonstrated by western blotting, whilst lps  treated microglia did express this enzyme . conditioned medium collected from wnt3a treated microglia did not possess significant neurotoxic properties as demonstrated by mtt and ldh assay . in contrast, conditioned medium collected from lps , oligomeric aβ  or oligomeric α-synuclein  treated microglia was neurotoxic, which is consistent with previously published findings
 <cit> . lps and oligomeric α-synuclein caused marginal, but non-significant, neuronal death when added to cortical neuron cultures with control microglial conditioned medium. the addition of oligomeric aβ in conjunction with control microglial conditioned medium to neurons evoked significant albeit comparatively low levels of death after  <dig> hours in culture. interestingly, conditioned medium collected from wnt3a treated microglia was slightly protective against neuronal death induced by medium collected from microglia treated with lps , oligomeric aβ  or oligomeric α-synuclein , although the results were not statistically significant. collectively, these findings suggest that wnt3a treated microglia do not exhibit a typical pro-inflammatory phenotype; in fact they might confer a small level of neuro-protection.

visualisation of microglial-derived exosomes induced by wnt3a treatment
electron microscopy corroborated proteomic data and demonstrated that wnt3a  treated microglia released exosomes that were electron-dense and approximately  <dig> nm in diameter, typical of exosomal size; 40- <dig> nm . microglial-derived exosomes aggregated in vitro and labelled positively with β-actin  and wnt3a , which illustrates their biological nature. freshly isolated exosomes were more disperse and osmium tetroxide staining revealed an elliptical structure enclosed by a lipid-bilayer .

double immuno-fluorescent staining in n <dig> microglial cells demonstrated the presence of wnt3a in early endosomes,  <dig> hours post treatment, with wnt3a co-localising with the endosomal marker rab <dig>  this indicates that wnt3a is endocytosed before being directed into exosomes for secretion . single staining for wnt3a or rab <dig> independently produced similar staining patterns .

wnt3a does not induce nuclear pyknosis or compromise cell membrane integrity
microglial cells treated with wnt3a  for  <dig> hours possessed large healthy nuclei, identical in appearance and number to control cells, as demonstrated by hoechst  <dig> staining . moreover, exosomes do not contain the pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome c as shown by lc/ms/ms . these findings indicate that wnt3a treatment does not trigger apoptosis and thus it is inferred that membrane blebbing is not elicited, which is a terminal event in the apoptotic pathway. therefore, apoptotic bodies most likely do not account for the presence of the extracellular vesicles identified in this study. furthermore, fluoroscein diacetate staining revealed that microglial cultures treated with wnt3a  for  <dig> hours comprised a similar number of fluorescent cells as untreated control cultures . fluoroscein diacetate is metabolised and retained by healthy cells comprising an intact plasma membrane resulting in the visualisation of an intracellular green fluorescent product. this fluorescent dye therefore provides a measure of cell membrane integrity. thus, these results indicate that the microglial cells are intact and cellular contents/organelles are retained inside the microglial cells following exposure to wnt3a and most likely do not contaminate the exosomal fraction.

effects of wnt3a on neuronal-derived exosomes
primary cultured rat cortical neurons released exosomes constitutively and wnt3a  treatment did not alter exosome secretion as measured in terms of total exosomal protein and the observable banding patterns visible upon coomassie staining . as was the case with microglia, wnt3a was detectable in neuronal-derived exosomes collected from wnt3a  treated cortical neurons . this suggests that wnt3a is endocytosed and packaged into exosomes sub-cellularly as is the case with microglia. exosomes derived from cortical neurons also contained, alix, the archetypal exosomal marker, as shown by western blotting .

wnt3a does not bind non-specifically to the external surface of exosomal membranes
to provide further evidence that wnt3a traverses the cell through the endocytic route and does not non-specifically associate with the external surface of exosomal membranes; exosomes were incubated with wnt3a in a cell free environment and the presence of wnt in the exosomal fraction was tested. cortical neurons were used to provide a source of exosomes due to the constitutive nature of their release from this cell type. exosomes isolated from  <dig>  million cortical neurons were incubated with wnt3a  for  <dig> hours. the exosomes were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 100000xg and the exosomal fraction and the supernatant were western blotted for the presence of wnt3a . wnt3a was only present in the supernatant. this suggests that wnt3a does not attach non-specifically to the external surface of the exosomal membranes; a phenomenon that could potentially occur through the hydrophobic lipid modifications that are present on wnt
 <cit> .

wnt3a- induced exosome secretion from microglia is independent of gsk3
the naturally occurring wnt antagonist dkk <dig>  failed to inhibit wnt3a-induced exosome release from microglia . the same concentration of dkk <dig>  caused the complete abatement of wnt3a-induced topflash activity in hek293a cells . in fact, dkk <dig> potentiated wnt3a-induced exosome release as measured by the presence of β-actin in the 100000xg fraction, which provides a surrogate measure for total exosomal protein. in contrast, dkk <dig> had no effect on exosome secretion when incubated with microglial cells alone. inhibition of gsk <dig> using lithium , which mimics β-catenin/gsk3-dependent wnt signaling, did not evoke exosome release or accentuate or attenuate wnt3a-induced release . lithium  did however, activate topflash in hek293a cells to a similar degree as wnt3a . together these findings suggest that wnt3a-induced exosome secretion occurs independently of gsk <dig> in microglia.

discussion
research into exosomal signaling in the cns is scant especially with regard to glial cells. however, astrocytes and glioblastomas release exosomes containing mitochondrial dna
 <cit>  and primary mouse microglia, bv <dig> microglial cells as well as the n <dig> microglial cell line have been reported to secrete exosomes constitutively
 <cit> . we show here that primary rat microglia release exosomes following stimulation with wnt3a, but exosomes or indeed other proteins are not released under control conditions in our study. this discrepancy with previous findings might reflect the down-regulated nature of our microglia isolated using percoll density gradient centrifugation compared to microglia isolated from mixed glial cultures, or microglial cell lines, which display a heighten activation state due to time spent in culture . wnt3a-induced exosomes were approximately  <dig> nm in diameter; typical of exosomal size. the vesicles aggregated in vitro and harboured immunoreactivity for alix and β-actin and contained a number of other structural enzymes as demonstrated by lc/ms/ms. wnt3a was found to be associated with exosomes both by electron microscopy and lc/ms/ms profiling. furthermore, immuno-localisation with rab <dig> suggests that wnt3a is internalised into early endosomes before being released from the cell in exosomes. this is consistent with a study that shows that internalisation of wnt is necessary for its signaling
 <cit> . the mechanism involved in wnt3a-induced exosome secretion remains to be determined, although the involvement of gsk <dig> was ruled out. little is known about the regulation of multi-vesicular body fusion and exosome release, although calcium
 <cit>  and citron kinase 
 <cit>  have been implicated. interestingly, dkk <dig> potentiated wnt3a-induced exosomes secretion, whilst dkk <dig> challenge alone did not stimulate exosomes release. this corroborates the notion that wnt3a is acting to elicit exosomes secretion through a pathway independent of gsk3/β-catenin as blocking this pathway diverts wnt3a to augment the activation of an alternate route. this is possible since dkk <dig> inhibits the gsk3/β-catenin pathway not by preventing wnt binding to frizzled, but rather by blocking the interaction of frizzled with the necessary co-receptors, lrp5/ <dig> 

wnt3a treated microglia did not secrete cytokines or express inos and therefore by supposition the signaling molecule nitric oxide was not released. furthermore, wnt3a treated microglia did not possess neurotoxic properties. in fact, wnt3a treated microglia conferred marginal protection against neuronal cell death elicited by microglia treated with aβ, α-synuclein or lps. it has recently been reported that wnt3a increases the expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnfα in microglia
 <cit> . however, the control cultures in the study reporting this were exposed to 1% bsa and it is not stipulated whether the recombinant wnt3a used was carrier-free. carriers could potentiate any microglial response especially if the carrier is bsa
 <cit> . in retinal cells activation of the β-catenin/gsk <dig> dependent wnt pathway with wnt3a is sufficient to induce inflammation characterised by vascular endothelial growth factor  and tnfα secretion and the production of reactive oxygen species
 <cit> . this suggests that wnt signaling might act in a cell type specific manner with respect to inflammatory signaling depending on the receptor profile expressed on a particular population of cells.

wnt3a associated with cortical neuron-derived exosomes following its prior addition to the extracellular milieu. however, wnt3a did not modify exosome secretion over baseline in neurons in terms of total protein levels in the 100000xg fraction and in the appearance of observable bands apparent on coomassie-stained gels. however, for this to be verified absolutely further lc/ms/ms analysis would have to be performed. exosomes derived from cortical neurons comprised a different protein profile to microglial-derived exosomes as illustrated by coomassie staining of the electrophoretically resolved exosomal proteomes. nonetheless, cortical neurons have been reported to release exosomes containing β-tubulin, γ-actin, clathrin heavy chain, ubiquitin and metabolic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde  <dig> phosphate dehydrogenase
 <cit> ; similar to those proteins found in the microglial derived exosomes described in this study. this suggests that a number of common proteins are found in exosomes originating from both cell types. in fact, the presence of metabolic enzymes in exosomes appears to be characteristic of such vesicles from a variety of cell types
 <cit> . heat shock proteins and annexins are also found in exosomes from a number of sources including keratinocytes and dendritic cells
 <cit> , which is consistent with our findings. endosomal-lysosomal sorting proteins such as endosomal sorting complex required for transport , tumour susceptibility gene  <dig>  and alix as well as tetraspanins are characteristic of exosomes. however, not all exosomes express these markers
 <cit> . alix was detectable in exosomes derived from cortical neurons and in both the 100000xg and 200000xg vesicular fractions isolated from wnt3a treated microglia.

the functional significance of wnt3a induced exosome secretion from microglia remains to be determined. neurons treated with exosomes derived from wnt3a treated microglia did not display an altered protein expression pattern as demonstrated by 2dge . this implies that the exosomes do not signal to alter neuronal phenotype/function. however, the effects of exosomal cargo transfer might be so subtle that they are beyond the limits of detection by 2dge. exosomes are known to play a role in antigen presentation
 <cit> , so it is conceivable that wnt-3a-induced exosome production might play a role in the central inflammatory response. exosomes derived from wnt3a treated microglia might also serve to create morphogen gradients during cns development; certainly amoeboid microglia play a key role in developmental processes. in drosophila, wingless  is found in multi-vesicular bodies and large intracellular vesicles as well as export vesicles known as argosomes
 <cit> . thus, wingless/wnt might be endocytosed and then passed from cell to cell via exosome-like vesicles to establish morphogen gradients. in addition or alternatively, wnt3a-induced microglial derived exosomes might function as a clearance system for unwanted cellular proteins. our proteomic data reveals the presence of ubiquitin and proteasomal subunits in microglial derived exosomes suggestive of a degradative role. consistent with this, the tetraspanins, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  possessing tumour supressor properties, down-regulate wnt signaling through the exosomal discharge of β-catenin
 <cit> . of note, sonic hedgehog, another modulator of gsk <dig> activity, when delivered using small membrane derived vesicles has been shown to promote angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells, which bears relevance for ischemic disease
 <cit> . indeed exosomes and other vesicular structures provide novel avenues for future therapies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, primary cultured rat microglia release electron dense exosomes after treatment with wnt3a that are loaded with proteinaceous cargo including structural proteins, metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in both protein synthesis and degradation. these findings have implications for cellular cross-talk in the cns, involving bulk transfer of material, in both health and disease.
