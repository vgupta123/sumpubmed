BACKGROUND
voltage-dependent kv <dig> k+ channels have specialized gating properties, including a depolarized activation range, fast activation, and very fast deactivation, that facilitate rapid, repetitive firing in neurons  <cit> . in mammals, there are four kv <dig> genes, kcnc1-kcnc <dig>  which encode kv <dig> -kv <dig>   <cit> . each gene is alternatively spliced, generating channel proteins with different carboxyl-terminal sequences  <cit> . kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  contain amino-terminal extensions that mediate n-type ball-and-chain inactivation  <cit> .

recently, kcnc <dig>  which encodes kv <dig> , was identified as the gene mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>   <cit> . the spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of  <dig> human autosomal dominant genetic diseases characterized by motor deficits, eye movement abnormalities, and degeneration of cerebellar neurons  <cit> . sca <dig> is the first neurodegenerative disease known to be caused by mutations in a k+ channel gene  <cit> .

the two originally-identified sca <dig> mutations lead to distinct clinical manifestations that are likely caused by their differential effects on kv <dig>  function  <cit> . the r420h mutation is associated with adult onset, progressive ataxia accompanied by progressive cerebellar degeneration. r420h is located in the s <dig> transmembrane segment, the main functional element of the voltage sensor. this mutation suppresses the amplitude of kv <dig> currents by a dominant negative mechanism  <cit> . in contrast, the f448l mutation is associated with persistent motor deficits that emerge in infancy. in affected children, the cerebellum is severely shrunken and malformed  <cit> . f448l is located near the cytoplasmic end of the s <dig> transmembrane segment, a region of the protein that couples voltage sensor conformational changes to opening and closing of the pore  <cit> . this mutation affects the unique gating properties of kv <dig> channels, shifting the voltage dependence of pore opening in the hyperpolarized direction and dramatically slowing channel closure  <cit> . interestingly, f448l changes a phenylalanine residue found only in kv <dig> channels to leucine, the residue found at the analogous position in all other kv channel subfamilies  <cit> . as a result, the mutation confers shaker-like gating properties on kv <dig>   <cit> . the distinct clinical manifestations of the r420h and f448l mutations are not likely to result from differences in genetic background because there is a strong genotype/phenotype correlation for age of disease onset in unrelated sca <dig> families  <cit> .

kv <dig>  is prominently expressed in cerebellar neurons  <cit> . given the importance of kv <dig> channels in controlling neuronal firing patterns, the locomotor deficits and loss of cerebellar neurons seen in sca <dig> may result from changes in the excitability of kv <dig> -expressing cells. development of an animal model is essential to investigate the mechanistic basis of sca <dig> and to explore the connections between electrical excitability, control of locomotor behavior, and neuronal cell death.

in recent years, the zebrafish, danio rerio, has been used extensively to investigate neuronal development. in addition, work from a growing number of laboratories demonstrates that zebrafish has great potential for analyzing nervous system function  <cit> . the zebrafish has been suggested as a model system for studying diseases that affect neuronal function and locomotion  <cit> . as the first step in assessing the suitability of zebrafish as a model system for sca <dig>  we have identified kv <dig> family members in zebrafish and characterized the functional properties of wild type and mutant kv <dig>  channels.

we report that the zebrafish genome  encodes six kv <dig> family members including two kv <dig>  genes, kcnc3a and kcnc3b. zebrafish and mammalian kv <dig>  channels exhibit strong functional homology and are similarly affected by sca <dig> mutations. these results suggest that the zebrafish is a promising model system for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying sca <dig> 

RESULTS
the zebrafish genome contains six kv <dig> family orthologs
to identify members of the kcnc gene family in zebrafish, the zv <dig> genome release was queried with multiple conserved segments of mammalian kv <dig> protein sequences using the program tblastn. sequences with the highest scoring similarity to mammalian kv <dig> channels consistently mapped to six genomic locations . in contrast, lower scoring hits showed greater similarity to members of other kv subfamilies .

 <dig> identities were assigned on the basis of the phylogenetic and syntenic analyses shown in figs. 1- <dig> 

 <dig> the identified exons encode the n-terminus, the s1-s <dig> membrane domain, the proximal portion of the c-terminus, and one or more putative sequences for the distal c-terminus, which may be alternatively spliced. the numbers correspond to the chromosomal positions of each exon.

 <dig> according to zv <dig>  there is an additional exon encoding a kv <dig> n-terminus on chromosome  <dig>  at position  <dig> , <dig>  because previous genome releases contained stray kv <dig> exons that disappeared in subsequent releases, this exon is likely to reflect an assembly error .

 <dig> in zv <dig>  the n-terminal exon of kcnc3b  is out of order compared to the other exons.

 <dig> in zv <dig>  the distal c-terminal exon of kcnc3b has been mapped to the plus strand, in contrast to the other exons.

to assemble putative sequences for kv <dig> proteins in zebrafish, predicted coding exons were identified directly by sequence similarity to the mammalian kv <dig> proteins. exons encoding the amino terminus, transmembrane core domain, and proximal carboxyl terminus were found at each of the six genomic locations . many of these exons were also recognized by ensembl transcript identification algorithms. in addition, each location contained one or more exons encoding the distal carboxyl terminus, a region that is alternatively spliced in mammalian kv <dig> genes .

phylogenetic identification of kv <dig> orthologs in zebrafish
for phylogenetic analysis of the six putative kv <dig> genes in zebrafish, exon sequences encoding the amino terminus, transmembrane core domain, and proximal carboxyl terminus were assembled and translated. sequences encoding probable alternatively-spliced, distal carboxyl termini were not included. the deduced protein sequences were aligned with ten kv <dig> sequences from mammalian, amphibian, and teleost species using the program muscle v <dig>  and the alignment was manually adjusted   <cit> . the identities of zebrafish kv <dig> genes were assigned by bootstrap analysis replicated  <dig> times using the program phyml   <cit> . the zebrafish genome contains two kcnc <dig>  orthologs, designated kcnc1a and kcnc1b; two kcnc <dig>  orthologs, designated kcnc3a and kcnc3b; and one ortholog each of kcnc <dig>  and kcnc <dig>  designated kcnc <dig> and kcnc <dig>  respectively . zebrafish kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  sequences contained n-terminal extensions as found in their mammalian counterparts   <cit> . over the aligned region, the amino acid identity between human kv <dig> sequences and their zebrafish orthologs ranged from  <dig> to 82% .

to verify the identity of mammalian kcnc orthologs in zebrafish, we analyzed synteny between the zebrafish and mouse genomes using the online program synteny database  <cit> . the strongest syntenic clusters, containing the greatest number of orthologous gene pairs, were found between chromosomal segments containing the following pairs of zebrafish and mouse genes: kcnc1b and kcnc1; kcnc <dig> and kcnc2; kcnc3a and kcnc3; and kcnc <dig> and kcnc <dig> . these results confirm the evolutionary relationship between genes encoding kv <dig> family members in zebrafish and mammals.

to verify the existence of paralogous kcnc <dig> and kcnc <dig> genes in zebrafish, we used synteny database to identify regions of conserved synteny on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>    <cit> . as expected, the chromosomal segments containing kcnc1a/kcnc1b and kcnc3a/kcnc3b pairs showed the strongest synteny in the zebrafish genome. the identification of two kcnc <dig> and two kcnc <dig> paralogs in zebrafish reflects genome duplication that occurred early during teleost evolution, after divergence of mammalian and teleost ancestors  <cit> .

the zebrafish genome contains two functional kv <dig>  paralogs
according to the zv <dig> genome release, plausible kv <dig> genes were located at five of the six identified genomic locations. putative coding exons were encoded on a single strand and were located in the correct order along the chromosome . in contrast, the kv <dig>  gene on chromosome  <dig>  kcnc3b, was rearranged . because the genome assembly is preliminary, this does not preclude the presence of an intact kv <dig>  gene on chromosome  <dig> 

we used reverse transcriptase pcr  to determine whether kcnc3a and kcnc3b are functional genes that are transcribed and appropriately spliced in zebrafish. rna was extracted from embryos at  <dig> to  <dig> days post fertilization and amplified using gene-specific primers located in different exons. each primer set yielded products of the expected size for a properly transcribed and spliced mrna . using rt-pcr, we cloned and sequenced cdnas corresponding to kcnc3a and kcnc3b amplified from embryonic cdna or an adult retinal cdna library. their nucleic acid and predicted protein sequences matched the genomic sequences found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the kv <dig>  paralogs are closely related. from the amino terminus through the proximal carboxyl terminus, the predicted amino acid sequences of kcnc3a and kcnc3b are 89% identical . rt-pcr analysis indicated that kcnc3a mrna is alternatively spliced, leading to protein variants with different carboxyl-terminal sequences . we conclude that there are two functional kv <dig>  genes in the zebrafish genome, despite the fact that one of them is not co-linear in the zv <dig> genome release.

kv <dig> subfamily-specific gating properties are conserved in zebrafish kv <dig> 
to characterize the functional properties of zebrafish kv <dig>  channels, cdna sequences encoding the two kcnc3a carboxyl-terminal splice variants were cloned into the bluescript vector for in vitro transcription of rna. rna encoding each splice variant was separately injected into xenopus oocytes for voltage clamp analysis . zebrafish kv <dig>  channels were robustly active with properties expected for a member of the kv <dig> family  <cit> . significant activation was detected starting at - <dig> mv . in contrast, in shaker, a member of the kv <dig> family, currents are typically detected between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. the probability of kv <dig>  channel opening, determined from normalized isochronal tail current amplitudes, increased steeply between - <dig> and  <dig> mv, with a midpoint voltage  of - <dig>  mv . upon repolarization to the holding voltage, channels closed rapidly . we conclude that the novel gating properties of kv <dig> channels from higher vertebrates are conserved in zebrafish kv <dig> , consistent with a role in facilitating fast, repetitive firing in neurons.

alternative splicing of the carboxyl terminus had no significant effect on channel function . similarly, alternative splicing of mammalian kv <dig> genes does not alter the functional properties of the channel  <cit> . instead, different kv <dig> carboxyl termini may be involved in targeting channel proteins to different subcellular compartments  <cit> .

zebrafish kv <dig>  currents showed prominent inactivation . zebrafish channels inactivated more quickly than human kv <dig>  , presumably because the amino terminal extension is shorter in the fish protein   <cit> . deleting the amino terminal extension removed fast inactivation, indicating that zebrafish kv <dig> , like mammalian kv <dig>  channels, is subject to n-type ball and chain inactivation   <cit> . co-expression of the non-inactivating zebrafish kv <dig>  with wild type human kv <dig>  produced currents with intermediate inactivation kinetics, consistent with co-assembly of the human and zebrafish subunits into functional tetrameric channels, as expected   <cit> .

mammalian kv <dig> channels are highly sensitive to the pore blocker tetraethylammonium   <cit> . unlike most k+ channels, which have a lower affinity for tea, mammalian kv <dig> channels are nearly completely blocked by  <dig> mm tea  <cit> . to investigate the tea sensitivity of zebrafish kv <dig>  channels, currents were recorded in the presence and absence of  <dig> mm tea . at + <dig> mv,  <dig> mm tea blocked 91% ± 1% of the kv <dig>  current amplitude . we conclude that high sensitivity to tea is conserved in zebrafish kv <dig>  channels.

sca <dig> mutations have conserved functional effects in human and zebrafish kv <dig> 
to explore further the functional relationship between zebrafish and mammalian kv <dig>  channels, we introduced into kcnc3a two sca <dig> mutations corresponding to r420h and f448l in human kv <dig>  . similarly to r420h, the corresponding mutation r335h was not functional when expressed alone but exerted a dominant negative effect on the activity of the zebrafish wild type subunit . because sca <dig> is an autosomal dominant disease, the dominant negative effect of r420h, recapitulated in r335h, is likely essential to the etiology of adult onset ataxia and neurodegeneration in affected individuals  <cit> .

f363l in kcnc3a corresponds to the human mutation f448l, which alters channel gating and causes infant onset motor problems and maldevelopment of the cerebellum  <cit> . f363l generated functional channels in oocytes. significant activation was detected at - <dig> to - <dig> mv, indicating that the voltage dependence of pore opening was shifted in the hyperpolarized direction . the midpoint voltage for activation, determined from the amplitudes of normalized isochronal tail currents, was - <dig>  mv, corresponding to a shift of - <dig>  mv compared to wild type kv <dig>  . for comparison, the analogous mutation in human kv <dig>   shifts activation ~ <dig> mv in the hyperpolarized direction  <cit> .

similarly to the human mutation, f363l dramatically slowed channel deactivation . tail currents, evoked in an  <dig> mm rb+ bath solution by repolarizing the membrane from + <dig> to - <dig> mv, were fitted with a single exponential function to characterize deactivation kinetics . values of τdeact in wild type kv <dig>  and the f363l mutant were  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ms, respectively. thus, f363l slowed channel closing by ~13-fold at - <dig> mv. for comparision, the analogous mutation in human kv <dig>   slowed channel closing by ~7-fold at - <dig> mv  <cit> . therefore, like its human counterpart, the f363l mutation specifically affects the voltage dependence of activation and the kinetics of channel closing, converting the unique kv <dig> gating properties to more closely resemble those of a shaker-type channel  <cit> . our results demonstrate that sca <dig> mutations have similar effects on human and zebrafish kv <dig>  channels, confirming that there is strong functional homology between kv <dig>  in teleost and mammalian species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
genes encoding the voltage-dependent kv <dig> , kv <dig> , kv <dig> , and kv <dig>  k+ channels have been identified in the zebrafish, danio rerio. two paralogous genes exist for both kv <dig>  and kv <dig> , reflecting an ancient genome duplication in the teleost line during evolution  <cit> . the unique gating properties of kv <dig> channels are conserved in zebrafish kv <dig> , suggesting that kv <dig> channels play an essential role in facilitating fast spiking in zebrafish neurons. sca <dig> mutations have very similar effects on the activity of human and zebrafish kv <dig>  channels, indicating that the mutations affect fundamental channel properties that have been conserved during evolution. our results suggest that expressing sca <dig> mutant subunits in zebrafish will provide an animal model useful for investigating the cellular basis of sca <dig>
