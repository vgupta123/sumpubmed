BACKGROUND
increasing nutrient input has led to eutrophication in many lakes, which coincides with the increasing dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton assemblages  <cit> . this increasing dominance of cyanobacteria has been claimed to be a major factor leading to the decline in daphnia abundance across and within lakes  <cit> . these observations from the field are corroborated by laboratory studies which have demonstrated negative effects of cyanobacteria on daphnia  <cit> . however, the generality of these observations has been questioned by a manipulative field study  <cit> , and other recent studies have indicated that daphnia may adapt to increasingly tolerate dietary cyanobacteria  <cit>  and that increased tolerance to cyanobacterial toxins may be transferred to the offspring generations  <cit> . however, neither on protein nor on genetic level have the underlying mechanisms for increased tolerance been addressed, yet. the genome of daphnia has recently become available, creating the opportunity to address the interaction of cyanobacteria and daphnia on the levels of gene expression and proteins more specifically.

cyanobacteria are known to contain toxins and an array of other biologically active secondary metabolites  <cit> . cyanobacterial protease inhibitors are among the most widely spread secondary metabolites, as they have been found in nearly every cyanobacterial bloom  <cit> . different protease inhibitors have been isolated from different cyanobacteria genera  <cit>  as well as from different cyanobacterial strains of the same species  <cit> . many cyanobacterial protease inhibitors act against serine proteases , which represent the most important digestive proteases in the gut of daphnia magna  <cit> , and of which a surprisingly high number was found in the genome of d. pulex  <cit> , a closely related species of d. magna.

here we tested whether daphnia displays physiological plasticity in response to dietary cyanobacterial protease inhibitors, assuming that positive selection for increased plasticity might be one mechanism for the recently reported adaptation of daphnia to co-occuring cyanobacteria  <cit> . more specifically, we investigated the physiological response of a given genotype of d. magna to dietary cyanobacterial protease inhibitors, making use of the previously reported specific interaction of these inhibitors with digestive trypsins and chymotrypsins of d. magna  <cit> . by feeding them mixtures of a green alga with two different strains of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa, which either contained trypsin- or chymotrypsin inhibitors, we were able to independently determine the effects of the two families of inhibitors on the expression and the activity of d. magna's digestive proteases.

RESULTS
somatic growth rates on different food treatments
when feeding on the green alga s. obliquus, d. magna grew at  <dig>  d- <dig> , whereas the growth rate on 20% of the cyanobacterium m. aeruginosa was significantly reduced  in both cyanobacterial treatments. growth on the mutant of pcc  <dig> was significantly lower  than on niva cya  <dig> .

activity and stability of daphnia serine proteases
the chymotrypsin activity of the daphnia homogenate was  <dig>  μmol pna/min/μg protein. there was a small, albeit significant  decrease between the specific activity of chymotrypsin of the daphnia homogenate and the same homogenate treated with  <dig> m urea .

the specific trypsin activity of the daphnia homogenate was  <dig>  μmol pna/min/μg protein. there was no significant  effect of  <dig> m urea on trypsin activity.

sds-page and native page of daphnia homogenate
the protease pattern  of the homogenate of d. magna grown on 100% s. obliquus showed five bands for trypsins  and four bands  which, based on indirect evidence, had been previously suggested to be chymotrypsins  <cit> ). there was no difference between the protease pattern of the daphnia homogenate  and the gut homogenate . the pattern was the same on a native page .

food treatments: sds-page
the protease pattern  of the homogenate of d. magna grown on 100% s. obliquus was the same as that of the homogenate of d. magna grown on 20% of the microcystin-free mutant of the cyanobacterium pcc  <dig>   <cit>  with regard to the number and the apparent molecular weight of the bands. however, weaker trypsin bands in the treatment with the cyanobacterium indicated reduced trypsin activity, while the intensity of the chymotrypsin bands was not affected.

in the homogenate of d. magna grown on 20% niva cya  <dig> , the band pattern of the trypsins with regard to the number and the apparent molecular weight of the bands did not change in comparison to animals grown on pure 100% s. obliquus. however, the intensity of the trypsin bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda increased; as did the chymotrypsin band at  <dig> kda. a different band pattern in the chymotrypsin bands also became obvious . the two visible bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda on the sds-page in the treatment with the cyanobacterium had a different apparent molecular weight than the  <dig> kda chymotrypsin band in the treatment with only the green alga.

amplification efficiencies of the protease primers
the amplification efficiencies  of the protease qpcr-primers all had a value around  <dig> , which means a doubling of dna in every cycle. the amplification efficiencies were considered in the analysis of the qpcr results.

the amplification efficiencies  of the primers developed for qpcr of the five serine proteases.

food treatments: qpcr
the treatment with 100% s. obliquus served as the calibrator for the other treatments; its relative protease expression was therefore always set to  <dig>  alpha-tubulin, sucdh and gapdh served as endogenous controls. the expression of the proteases changed significantly in both cyanobacterial treatments  compared to the calibrator .

in the treatment with 20% niva cya  <dig>  the proteases were up-regulated between  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold ; in the treatment with 20% pcc  <dig> mut the relative expression was also significantly up-regulated in all proteases; however, the effects were weaker than in the treatment with niva cya  <dig> ; .

lc-ms/ms analysis of protease bands
the homogenate of daphnia fed with 100% s. obliquus and the homogenate of daphnia fed with niva cya  <dig>   were subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis. most bands of the sds-page with homogenate of d. magna fed with 100% s. obliquus could be identified via lc-ms/ms and database search using the mowse algorithm as implemented in the ms search engine mascot   <cit>  . the sequence match for the mass spectra of the bands from the 100% s. obliquus homogenate was low . however, there were hardly any strikingly non-matching sequences. since the proteases had very few cutting sites for trypsins, which is not surprising for they are all serine proteases, the sequence match with  <dig> to 10% was acceptable.

the bands of the 100% s. obliquus homogenate previously suggested to be chymotrypsins  <cit>  could be assigned to the proteases  <dig>  and  <dig> , which had the best combination of the factors probability mowse score as well as the highest number of matched sequences and sequence coverage . all three identified proteases were chymotrypsins. only one  of the suggested chymotrypsin bands could not be identified. the bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, formerly specified as trypsins  <cit> , could be assigned to the proteases  <dig> and  <dig>  which are both trypsins. they could not be differentiated because they matched to the same set of sequences.

however, the bands of the homogenate of d. magna fed with 20% niva cya  <dig> and 80% s. obliquus  could all be identified . the lc-ms/ms results of the bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda were identical to those of the respective bands in the 100% s. obliquus lane and were assigned to the trypsins  <dig> and  <dig>  however, here the identification was clearer: the two bands at  <dig> and  <dig> kda were trypsin 208; the two others were trypsin  <dig>  the band at  <dig> kda that was visible in both gels could be identified as protease  <dig> in the 20% niva cya  <dig> homogenate, which is also a trypsin, matching the results of agrawal et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . as also found for the gel with d. magna fed with 100% s. obliquus, the four bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda were also assigned to the proteases  <dig> and  <dig>  although the two bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda  of the gel with d. magna fed with 20% niva cya  <dig> had another apparent molecular weight. although no longer active in the sds-page , the chymotrypsin  <dig> at  <dig> kda was still found at this position in the lc-ms/ms analysis. these three different bands from the two sds-pages of both homogenates were all assigned to ct <dig>  and thus represent three different isoforms of the same protease. in the homogenate of daphnia fed with 20% niva cya  <dig>  the bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda identified as protease  <dig> were the same as in the gel with homogenate of daphnia grown on 100% s. obliquus. the protease at  <dig> kda was identified as protease  <dig>  another chymotrypsin. the proteases of both homogenates in the sds-page are accordingly assigned .

expression of serine proteases after  <dig> h
the protease pattern of d. magna grown on 100% s. obliquus was the same after  <dig> as after  <dig> h . when fed with 20% niva cya  <dig>  a shift in the protease pattern of the daphnids already took place after  <dig> h. a subsequent transfer of the animals to 100% s. obliquus for another  <dig> h led to an intermediate pattern with active proteases from both treatments, the 20% niva cya  <dig> and the 100% s. obliquus treatment .

cyclophilin, sucdh and ubc served as endogenous controls in the qpcr analysis. the relative expression of proteases had changed compared to the calibrator . all effects were significant .

the proteases t <dig>  t <dig> and ct <dig> showed consistent results. in the food treatment with 20% niva cya  <dig> they were up-regulated after  <dig> h compared to the calibrator . t <dig> and ct <dig> were slightly up-regulated after  <dig> h on 100% s. obliquus, while for t <dig> the expression stayed the same as after  <dig> h on 100% s. obliquus; all three proteases showed the highest  up-regulation in the treatment with  <dig> h 20% niva cya 43/ <dig> h s. obliquus compared to all other treatments.

in ct <dig> the results were the same except for the  <dig> h 20% niva cya  <dig> treatment. here, the expression was significantly lower than in the calibrator.

the regulation of ct <dig>  however, differed considerably from that of the other proteases. here, in the treatment with  <dig> h 20% niva cya  <dig> the expression was up-regulated already over 7-fold compared to the calibrator. after  <dig> h s. obliquus the expression of ct <dig> increased  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> h s. obliquus and was therefore even more induced than in the treatment with  <dig> h 20% niva cya  <dig>  however, ct <dig> showed a higher level of induction after  <dig> h 20% niva cya 43/ <dig> h s. obliquus compared to the calibrator , but was significantly lower than on  <dig> h s. obliquus.

expression of serine proteases in the presence of microcystin
in order to test for effects of microcystin on protease expression, d. magna were fed with the microcystin-producing strain of pcc  <dig> wt or with its mutant pcc  <dig> mut, which is incapable of producing microcystin. actin, sucdh and alpha-tubulin served as endogenous controls in the qpcr analysis. there were significant  changes in relative expression between the treatments with 10% microcystin-free strain pcc  <dig> mut, 10% microcystin-containing pcc  <dig> wt and 100% s. obliquus . these changes in relative protease expression were low  and negligible compared to the effects of the trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors from the 20% cyanobacterial food treatments with pcc  <dig> mut and niva cya  <dig> 

discussion
daphnia magna fed with 100% green alga showed normal to high growth rates , whereas the growth rate when fed with 20% cyanobacterial food was reduced. a reduction in growth rate or body length as an effect of cyanobacterial food has been observed previously in various daphnia species: growth reduction due to interference of filamentous cyanobacteria with the filtering apparatus  <cit>  or due to a deficiency of polyunsaturated fatty acids   <cit>  or sterols  <cit> , or because of the toxin content  <cit> . the m. aeruginosa strains used here were single-celled, small enough to be ingested, and did not contain microcystins  <cit> . furthermore, a reduction in growth rate due to pufa or sterol limitation can be excluded, since ≥ 80% of the dietary carbon was of eukaryotic origin, i.e. s. obliquus  <cit> . therefore, in our case, growth rate reduction in response to cyanobacteria is probably caused by serine protease inhibitors, since the cyanobacterial strains used contain either mainly trypsin inhibitors  or strong chymotrypsin inhibitors .

the most important digestive serine proteases in daphnia magna are trypsins and chymotrypsins  <cit> . for whole body homogenate, we found that the activity of chymotrypsins was ten times that of trypsins, corroborating findings for gut homogenate  <cit> . von elert et al.  <cit>  observed nine protease bands in d. magna gut homogenate on an activity stained sds-page; the identical pattern is discernable for whole body homogenate . this demonstrates that whole-body daphnia homogenate can be used for further analyses, which is in accordance with the finding that whole-body activity shows only minor differences from the proteolytic activity of the gut associated activity  <cit> . digestive proteases often have a compact molecular structure; this structure does not seem to be affected by sds, as the protease pattern from native and sds-page was identical . from another crustacean species, cancer pagurus, it is known that trypsin and chymotrypsin activity is stable in regard to temperature and to many organic solvents  <cit> ; our study shows that  <dig> m urea hardly affects trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in daphnia, also indicating very stable proteases. hence, it was not surprising that the proteases remained folded under denaturing conditions in sds-page, which resulted in a misinterpretation of the true molecular weight. a similar misinterpretation was made earlier for a trypsin from crangon spp.  <cit> . in sds-page of d. magna homogenate, the proteases had apparent molecular weights between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. where possible, the true molecular weights of the proteases were calculated after translation of the cdna sequences from the est-database  from the start- to the stop-codon. the true molecular weights differed from the apparent molecular weights .

delineated are the names and the accession numbers of the proteases of d. magna from the est-database search and the established forward and reverse primers for the qpcr analyses . apparent molecular weights  resulted from the comparison of the molecular weight marker with the visible protease bands in the sds-page, whereas true mw resulted from the translation of the sequences  of the est-database . no complete sequence was available for t <dig>  .

the protease band pattern of d. magna grown on 20% pcc  <dig> mut was the same  as on 100% s. obliquus. however, all trypsin bands showed reduced activity when the animals were fed with 20% pcc  <dig> mut, which is explicable by the release of cyanobacterial trypsin inhibitors from the microcystis cells after ingestion by daphnia during subsequent digestion in the gut. the activity of the chymotrypsins in the gel was not affected by this cyanobacterium, which is in accordance with the findings that pcc  <dig> mut mostly contains trypsin inhibitors  <cit> . a different effect was visible for d. magna fed with 20% niva cya  <dig>  this cyanobacterial strain affected both types of serine proteases. in spite of the high content of chymotrypsin inhibitors in this cyanobacterial strain  <cit> , the chymotrypsin band at  <dig> kda of the daphnia homogenate slightly increased in intensity . although the protein was still detectable, the  <dig> kda chymotrypsin was no longer active in the presence of dietary chymotrypsin inhibitors, leading to reduced total chymotrypsin activity in d. magna homogenate. this reduction of chymotrypsin activity was partly compensated for by the expression of the two new isoforms at  <dig> and  <dig> kda. these two new isoforms proved to be active in the presence of chymotrypsin inhibitors , indicating that these isoforms are less sensitive against the cyanobacterial inhibitors than the  <dig> kda chymotrypsin. the additional expression of less sensitive chymotrypsins strongly suggests that this regulatory response to dietary chymotrypsin inhibitors is adaptive to d. magna.

despite the expression of additional chymotrypsins, the overall activity of these proteases was visibly reduced in the presence of dietary chymotrypsin inhibitors , since the intensities of the chymotrypsin protease bands were weaker than those of the chymotrypsin bands in the 100% s. obliquus treatment.

moreover, chymotrypsin inhibitors led to a strong increase in trypsin activity. this can be considered to be an indirect effect of the chymotrypsin inhibitors and might be a compensatory physiological response of d. magna to cope with a reduced chymotrypsin activity.

in summary, the ingestion of the trypsin inhibitors cyanopeptolins  <cit>  from pcc  <dig> mut only led to a decrease in trypsin activity of d. magna, whereas the chymotrypsin inhibitors nostopeptin bn <dig> and cyanopeptolin  <dig>  <cit>  from niva cya  <dig> not only affected chymotrypsin, but also led to an increase in trypsin activity as a putative compensatory response.

the previous classification of five protease bands on sds-page as trypsins was based on the inhibition by synthetic inhibitors, and the remaining active protease bands were merely postulated to be chymotrypsins  <cit> . here, via lc-ms/ms and subsequent database search, all daphnia proteases were clearly identified as trypsins or chymotrypsins and assigned to protease genes. the reason for two bands in the same lane in the sds-page referring to the same protease gene might be protein ripening or unspecific proteolytic degradation during the gel run. alternatively, it might be attributed to the presence of splice variants or isoforms stemming from two different gene copies simultaneously active in daphnia.

the two homogenates, which showed differences in the protease band pattern  were analysed by lc-ms/ms . the chymotrypsin bands, which were identified as ct <dig>  showed a different molecular weight pattern in the two homogenates . although not visible as an active protease in the 20% niva cya  <dig> treatment on the sds-page , the ct <dig> protein at  <dig> kda still was found. this result points to total inhibition of the  <dig> kda isoform of ct <dig> due to dietary chymotrypsin inhibitors from niva cya  <dig>  however, other isoforms of ct <dig> which were more resistant to the inhibitor were expressed, and it is reasonable to assume that these isoforms stem from different gene copies. the d. pulex genome has been shown to contain a surprisingly high number of gene duplicates, leading to lineage-specific gene family expansions, which resulted in high numbers of genes . rapid gene family expansions in phenotypically important genes suggest scenarios wherein adaptive natural selection favours additional copies, e.g. for adaptation to increased dosage  <cit> . in several insects, amplification of different esterase genes was the reason for resistance to organophosphate pesticides  <cit> ; resistant strains of the mosquito culex pipiens even showed a 250-fold increase in copy numbers  <cit> .

to test if the observed changes in activity of the proteases on the sds-pages are caused by a change in gene expression, the relative expression of two trypsin genes  and of three chymotrypsin genes  in d. magna fed with three different food treatments were analysed with qpcr . in the treatment with 20% niva cya  <dig>  both trypsins and ct <dig> were up-regulated by a factor of between  <dig> and  <dig>  these results are reflected in the increased activity that was visible on the sds-page . however, although the relative expression of ct <dig> and ct <dig> comparably increased , only low activity of ct <dig> and of the two newly expressed isoforms of ct <dig> was observed on the sds-page . one explanation for the low activity of ct <dig> might be that the new isoforms are not as active as ct <dig> in d. magna fed with green alga. ct <dig>  of which no isoforms were detectable, might be more sensitive to the chymotrypsin inhibitors, so that the higher expression of ct <dig> might have been insufficient to compensate for simultaneous inhibition of the ct <dig> protein.

the  <dig>  to 6-fold increase of the relative trypsin expression in d. magna fed with 20% pcc  <dig> mut was not visible as increased activity in the gel ; the same is true for the increase in chymotrypsin expression . sds-page is not sensitive enough to quantify protease activity, as doubling the amount of daphnia homogenate in sds-page did not lead to an apparent increase in protease activity on the gels . hence, it is not surprising that the change in expression of trypsins and chymotrypsins of daphnia from up to 5-fold was not visible as an increase in activity in sds-page.

effects of different food treatments on the activity of digestive proteases in d. magna were already observed after  <dig> hours, which means that only a short period is required for d. magna to respond to the occurrence of dietary protease inhibitors. such a rapid physiological response seems to be highly adaptive, since newborn daphnia have to establish an optimal protease pattern quickly after birth to be able to initiate digestion. gustafsson et al.  <cit>  have shown that increased tolerance to microcystin-containing cyanobacteria was transferred to the offspring generations. if such a mechanism is also true for dietary protease inhibitors, maternal transfer might also lead to a fast establishment of an optimal protease pattern in newborn daphnia.

nevertheless, the additional expression of isoforms after  <dig> h and the concurrently observed up-regulation of protease expression of daphnia fed with cyanobacteria are allocating additional resources to these proteins and can be assumed to be costly. to render the induction of proteases an evolutionary stable strategy, the level of expression should be tightly linked to the level of dietary protease inhibitors. however, such an immediate down-regulation of protease expression after sudden removal of dietary protease inhibitors was not observed, and an intermediate band pattern was visible in sds-page . these observations can easily be explained by the fact that cyanobacterial mass developments in nutrient-rich lakes usually last for several months in summer so that the disappearance of cyanobacteria is a gradual process that can take several weeks  <cit> . hence, the disappearance of cyanobacterial protease inhibitors will be considerably slower under field conditions than under our experimental conditions, which means that daphnia are fully capable of adjusting the expression level of proteases to the presence of protease inhibitors in the natural diet.

as ct <dig> was the only protease showing a completely different response to cyanobacterial protease inhibitors in qpcr analyses, it has been concluded that ct <dig> must be regulated in a manner different from the other proteases. interestingly, ct <dig> is the only protease which expresses new isoforms after daphnia had been fed with dietary cyanobacterial food . further investigation of the regulation and of the processing leading to these new isoforms is needed. however, protease inhibitors are obviously a strong trigger for up-regulation of protease expression and for an induction of new isoforms. these protease inhibitors might also exert a strong selection pressure on daphnia proteases themselves.

numerous studies have focused on microcystins as the only reason for decreased fitness in daphnia due to cyanobacteria, since microcystin lr is known to inhibit protein phosphatases of daphnia in-vitro  <cit> . however, other secondary metabolites also have proved to have adverse effects on daphnia  <cit> . the most widespread group of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are protease inhibitors, which appear in nearly all cyanobacterial blooms  <cit> , whereas this is not the case for microcystins. von elert et al.  <cit>  have shown that the most important group of digestive enzymes in daphnia are trypsins and chymotrypsins; these enzymes are indeed inhibited in vitro by specific cyanobacterial inhibitors  <cit> . by differentiating the effects of pcc  <dig> wt and its microcystin-deficient mutant on daphnia, both of which are known to contain strong trypsin inhibitors  <cit> , the negative effects of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria on daphnia could only be assigned to this compound to a limited degree  <cit> . qpcr results showed no difference in the regulation of proteases in the gut of d. magna between pcc  <dig> wt and mut, which clearly demonstrates that the interaction of cyanobacterial protease inhibitors with digestive proteases in daphnia is not affected by microcystins. protease inhibitors should affect gut proteases of daphnia immediately after ingestion of the cyanobacterial food particles and the subsequent release of inhibitors during digestion, before microcystins come in contact with their targets, i.e. protein phosphatases i and ii. this suggests that the tolerance of digestive proteases against dietary protease inhibitors in daphnia coexisting with cyanobacteria should be under strong positive selection, even in the presence of other cyanobacterial inhibitors.

daphnia serine proteases have been shown in-vitro to be inhibited by specific cyanobacterial inhibitors  <cit> . here for the first time it was shown that a d. magna clone in-situ physiologically responds to dietary cyanobacterial protease inhibitors by phenotypic plasticity of the targets of these specific inhibitors, i.e. daphnia gut proteases. the finding that d. magna responds to dietary protease inhibitors by up-regulation of protease expression on the rna-level and by the expression of new and less-sensitive protease isoforms on the protein level strongly suggest that the observed phenotypic plasticity is adaptive.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this is the first report on physiological plasticity in d. magna in response to the most widely spread cyanobacterial inhibitors, i.e., protease inhibitors. we have been able to show distinct physiological responses to dietary trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors. these physiological responses involve increased expression of the targets of these inhibitors, digestive trypsins and chymotrypsins, and the expression of less-sensitive isoforms. clearly these regulatory responses are adaptive for d. magna as they increase the capacity for protein digestion in the presence of dietary protease inhibitors. it is therefore reasonable to assume that the kind and extent of these responses in protease expression determine the degree of growth rate reduction in d. magna in the presence of cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors. these physiological responses proved to be independent from microcystin effects, as there only were negligible differences between protease expression of d. magna fed with m. aeruginosa pcc <dig> wt and its microcystin-free mutant. daphnia neonates respond very quickly to cyanobacterial food , which supports the assumption that dietary cyanobacterial protease inhibitors exert a strong selection pressure on daphnia proteases themselves.
