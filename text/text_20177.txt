BACKGROUND
j. curcas, a deciduous tree species belonging to the euphorbiaceae family, is a drought resistant oil species widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas, especially in central and south america, africa, india and southeast asia  <cit> . among the potential biofuel crops, j. curcas has been gaining importance as the most promising oilseed, as it does not compete with the edible oil supplies. however, the lack of adequate genetic variation and non-availability of improved varieties limits its prospects of being a successful energy crop  <cit> . in addition, j. curcas plants are endowed with a high tolerance to conditions of drought and heat, moderate tolerance to salinity and heavy metals, but very low tolerance to low temperatures  <cit>  which is the bottleneck for cultivation and commercialization of j. curcas. low temperatures have persistent and detrimental effects on j. curcas crop establishment via the depletion of photosynthesis brought by chilling and freezing injuries  <cit> . the damage of cold stress may cause a sharp decrease in chlorophyll contents and membrane unsaturated fatty acids of j. curcas and even survival of seedlings  <cit> .

gao et al. suggest that besides the ros  scavenging system, flavonoids from the phenylpropanoid pathway can also protect membrane lipids during cold stress in j. curcas seedlings exposed to temperatures as low as 4 °c  <cit> . a global view of the j. curcas transcriptome in response to cold stress revealed that  <dig>  transcripts are possibly associated with cold resistance  <cit> . in our previous study, we found that expression of the jcerf gene is rapidly induced upon salinity, drought, ethylene and mechanical wounding treatments. overexpression of jcerf in transgenic arabidopsis enhances the salt and freezing tolerance  <cit> . additionally, expression of jcdreb is induced by cold, salt and drought stresses, but not by aba. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing jcdreb exhibit enhanced tolerance to salt and freezing stresses  <cit> . although we have made some progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of j. curcas cold stress responses, the roles of transcriptional factors, especially for the myb family which play a conserved role in the regulation of stress responses, has not been well illustrated.

according to the number of adjacent myb repeats , myb proteins can be classified into four subfamilies: myb proteins with one repeat are named 1r-myb ; with two, 2r-myb ; with three, 3r-myb ; and with four, 4r-myb   <cit> . in plants, r2r3-myb is the largest subfamily. the phylogenetic comparison of this superfamily in arabidopsis and rice indicated that the arabidopsis myb superfamily undergo a rapid expansion after its divergence from monocots but before its divergence from other dicots  <cit> . currently, there is some controversy about the evolution and categorization of subgroups. for instance, in arabidopsis,  <dig> r2r3-myb have been listed into  <dig> subgroups by dubos et al.  <cit> , which is different from kranz et al., who categorized these mybs into  <dig> subgroups  <cit> . nevertheless, there are similar functions between members of each subgroup and there is cross-interaction among of them  <cit> . recently, the increasing availability of plant genome sequences has facilitated a better understanding of this large gene family. in addition to arabidopsis, genome wide characterization of the myb family, especially for r2r3-myb, have been completed in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , barely  <cit> , foxtail millet  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , orange  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . comparative expression profile analysis of r2r3-myb genes in these species suggested that myb proteins play conserved and various roles in development, growth and regulation of the metabolism of plants  <cit> . myb proteins have important roles in phytohormone signal transduction and various stress response pathways  <cit> . the expression of atmyb <dig> is up-regulated by aba and the overexpression atmyb <dig> enhances the drought tolerance of transgenic plants  <cit> . under these conditions, the rd <dig> and atadh <dig> are also up-regulated, which suggests that atmyb <dig> functions in aba-inducible gene expression under drought stress in plants  <cit> . by interacting with ice <dig>  atmyb <dig> acts as a negative regulator of freezing tolerance by suppressing the expression of cbf  <cit> . genevestigator analysis show that  <dig>  and  <dig>  % myb genes in arabidopsis are up- and down-regulated in cold stress, respectively  <cit> . it is thus reasonable that myb proteins may be key regulatory nodes of plant responses to cold stresses. therefore, in this study, we performed genome-wide identification of the myb family in j. curcas, and further determined the function of the cold and salt responsive myb <dig> gene in j. curcas.

RESULTS
identification of j. curcas myb genes
we used three approaches to identify the myb protein encoding genes in j. curcas genome. to confirm the myb protein models that were identified, all of the genes derived from the selected jcmyb candidate genes were examined using the online databases pfam and smart with default cutoff parameters. as a result,  <dig> typical non-redundant r2r <dig> myb transcription factors,  <dig> r1r2r <dig> mybs, and  <dig> 4r-like myb s were confirmed from the original data. this number is similar with that found in arabidopsis. additionally, the protein character of these  <dig> r2r <dig> myb transcription factors were list in additional file  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis and functional prediction of j. curcas r2r3-myb
to evaluate the evolutionary relationships within the r2r3-myb gene family, we performed a combined phylogenetic analysis of arabidopsis and j. curcas myb proteins using the neighbor joining method. based on conserved dna binding domain similarity and topology of their encoded proteins, we subdivided the  <dig> typical members of the j. curcas r2r3-myb gene subfamily into  <dig> groups  according to the alignment results . the alignment result was provided in additional file  <dig>  generally, the number of orthologs were similar between arabidopsis and j. curcas. however, some homologs were clustered remarkably by species within the same clade or the number of homologs from two species was greatly asymmetrical in one group or clade. for example, two atmybs and  <dig> jcmybs were included in group g <dig> fig.  <dig> evolutionary relationships of jcr2r3-myb. the evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method. the statistical method is maximum likelihood . the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig> replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the mybs analyzed. the evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site. the analysis involved  <dig> amino acid sequences. evolutionary analyses were conducted in mega <dig> . among of these, jcmyb <dig> is a member of group  <dig> and identified by the red square



the functions of some arabidopsis r2r <dig> myb members have been well characterized experimentally, and phylogenetic analysis has identified several functional groups  <cit> . most of jcr2r3-myb proteins were clustered into the functional groups found in arabidopsis , including stress response, cell cycle, cell wall thickening, meristem formation, and secondary metabolism.

cloning and expression profile of the jcmyb <dig> gene
the full length of jcmyb <dig> gene  is 908 bp and contains an orf  of 570 bp that encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  9 kda and a pi of  <dig> . analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that it is an r2r3-myb protein with two imperfect repeat sequences in its myb domain. based on the phylogenetic tree of j. curcas and arabidopsis myb proteins, jcmyb <dig> clustered in group g <dig> with arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> . there are two introns in the orf of jcmyb <dig>  with lengths of  <dig> and 72 bp, respectively. the gene structure of jcmyb <dig> is shown in fig. 2a.fig.  <dig> the gene structure and the dimensional structure of jcmyb <dig> protein. a the structure of jcmyb <dig> gene. there were two introns and three exons in this gene. the length of exon  <dig> and  <dig> included the length of the 5′ and 3′ utr, respectively. b the alignment of jcmyb <dig> and its ortholog proteins of arabidopsis. the red asterisk show the variant amino acid residues. r <dig> and r <dig> hth represent the myb repeat domain



the three-dimensional spatial structure of the jcmyb <dig> protein, predicted via cphmodels- <dig> , showed that jcmyb <dig> spatial structure has typical structure for r2r3-myb proteins, namely two consecutive hth  domains ; these constitute its dna-binding domain and are predict to bind the major groove of dna.

to determine whether jcmyb <dig> functions in stress responses in j. curcas, we assayed its expression following exposure of the plants to cold temperatures; high salt conditions; and both aba and meja. results showed that jcmyb <dig> transcripts were induced after 3 h cold stress treatment and reached their maximum at 6 h . its expression pattern under salt stress was similar with that of cold . for aba treatment, expression of jcmyb <dig> was initially induced after 1 h and accumulated continuously for 24 h . additionally, under meja treatment jcmyb <dig> transcript was gradually increased and also reached its maximum at 6 h under meja treatment, then decreased sharply and returned to original levels . under normal conditions, the expression of jcmyb <dig> in the root was much higher than that in the stem, leaf and cotyledon  which suggested that jcmyb <dig> was differentially expressed within different tissues of the plant.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of jcmyb <dig>  a expression pattern of jcmyb <dig> under 4 °c cultivate condition. b expression pattern of jcmyb <dig> under 200 mm nacl treatment. c expression pattern of jcmyb <dig> under 100 μm aba treatment. d expression pattern of jcmyb <dig> under 100 μm meja treatment. e the organ specific expression pattern of the jcmyb <dig> gene. transcript levels were determined by quantitative rt-pcr. expression of j. curcas actin was used as an internal control. error bars indicate standard deviation of three independent biological replications



promoter isolation and activity analysis of jcmyb2
the promoter sequence of jcmyb <dig> was cloned using tail-pcr and was subsequently confirmed by pcr designed according to the j. curcas genome database . the structure of the jcmyb <dig> promoter region was analyzed by searching the plant cis-acting element database place  and plant care ; the results are shown in table  <dig>  this promoter contains total putative  <dig> cis-elements classified in to  <dig> types, including those involved in aba responses and stress tolerance, low temperature stress tolerance, ja-induced plant disease resistance, sa-induced pathogen resistance and meristem development.fig.  <dig> the sequence of jcmyb <dig> gene. start codon atg is marked by underline, conserved region of tata-box and caat region are indicated in blue box and red ellipse respectively. the transcriptional site and termination site are marked as green and gray box respectively




gus staining of transgenic arabidopsis harboring pro-jcmyb2::gus revealed that the jcmyb <dig> promoter is very active in the root, but has only slightly activity in the leaf and stem . cold, salt, aba and meja could induce gus expression in transgenic arabidopsis .fig.  <dig> the promoter activity of jcmyb <dig>  detection of jcmyb <dig> promoter activity by gus staining. a wild type. b the transgenic plant under normal cultural condition. c seedlings under 4 °c cultivate condition for 6 h. d seedlings under salt treatment . e seedlings under aba treatment . f seedlings under meja treatment . b, c, d, e and f show gus staining signal except for a. the gus staining analysis of transgenic arabidopsis harboring pro-jcmyb2:: gus revealed that the jcmyb <dig> promoter was active in transgenic seedlings. c, d, e and f display gus staining signal which proved that its activity of jcmyb <dig> promoter will be increased under cold, salt, aba and meja treatment



transcriptional activity and subcellular localization of the jcmyb <dig> protein
the transcriptional activity of jcmyb <dig> was tested using a yeast one-hybrid assay. the yeast strain ah <dig> containing the vector pbridge  could not grow on sd medium without his and trp . however, cells harboring the pbridge-jcmyb <dig> and pbridge-jcerf  could grow normally on the same medium and exhibited blue in β-galactosidase assay . these results indicate that jcmyb <dig> can function as a transcriptional activator.fig.  <dig> transactivational assay of jcmyb <dig>  the full-length orf of jcmyb <dig> was fused with pbridge, and the transformed ah <dig> yeasts were selected from sd-trp-his medium. jcerf was used as a positive control, and empty pbridge vector was used as a negative control. a the position of each transformed yeast cell. b the growth status of the transformed ah <dig> cells on the sd medium. c the reporter activity detected by β-galactosidase activity assay



to determine the subcellular localization of jcmyb <dig>  we visualized a jcmyb2-gfp fusion protein in tobacco epidermal cells using confocal microscopy. in these cells, gfp signal was observed exclusively in the nucleus, while gfp fluorescence in control, pcambia1302-gfp was distributed in the whole cell . thus, the result suggested that jcmyb <dig> is a nuclear protein.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of jcmyb <dig> protein. transient expression of pcambia1302- jcmyb <dig> fusion and pcambia <dig> construct in tobacco epidermal cells. green fluorescence was observed using a confocal microscope at 48 h after a. tumefaciens infiltration. micrographs showing cells expressing gfp  or jcmyb2::gfp  fusion protein. from left to right, the pictures showed dapi, fluorescent-field illumination, bright-field, and overlay of three illuminations. bar = 30 μm



heterologous expression of jcmyb <dig> enhances salt and freezing tolerance of arabidopsis
to investigate the biological function of jcmyb <dig>  ten day old seedlings of transgenic and wild type arabidopsis were transferred to ms medium supplemented with 200 mm nacl after germination on ms medium. the survival percentage of jcmyb <dig> transgenic arabidopsis was more than  <dig>  % under salt stress, which was significantly higher than that of wild type arabidopsis  . for the freezing tolerance test, three-week-old plants were exposed to −8 °c for 20 h, and then recovered in chambers at 23 °c for  <dig> d. the transgenic plants expressing jcmyb <dig> were able to grow after being removed from sub-zero temperatures, while the wild type plants withered and died under these conditions . taken together, these results show that overexpression of jcmyb <dig> in arabidopsis confers tolerance to both high salt and low temperature stresses.fig.  <dig> cold and salt stress response of arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing jcmyb <dig>  three-week-old plants, including wild type and transgenic plants, were exposed to −8 °c for 20 h, after which the temperature was returned to 23 °c for 7 days. the growth of wild type and transgenic lines plants were grown on ms media for 10 days and then transferred onto the ms with 200 mm nacl for salt stress. when the difference of phenotype between wild type and transgenic lines were apparent, the photograph were taken



discussion
identification and functional prediction of the j. curcas myb family
to identify the myb transcription factor-encoding genes in j. curcas, we searched the entire j. curcas genome and two databases for genes that encode proteins containing the myb dna binding domain. as is well known, the myb family is the most abundant transcription factor family in plants and r2r3-myb is the largest subfamily. correspondingly, there are  <dig> r2r3-myb proteins in the maize  <cit> ,  <dig> in the sweet orange  <cit> ,  <dig> in arabidopsis,  <dig> in rice  <cit> ,  <dig> in soybean  <cit>  and  <dig> in populus  <cit> . additionally, there are  <dig> typical r2r3-myb proteins, five r1r2r3-myb proteins, and two 4r-like myb proteins in the apple genome  <cit> . while the number of r2r3-myb-encoding genes has expanded in different species, the number of r1r2r3-myb and 4r-myb genes has not changed. all vertebrate myb proteins are in the 3r-myb subfamily, which is also present in almost every plant studied  <cit> , suggesting that the 3r-myb encoding genes represent an ancient and evolutionarily conserved family. in both plants and vertebrates, 3r-myb proteins regulate progress through cell cycle transitions  <cit> .

these j. curcas r2r3-myb proteins were divided into  <dig> groups, and the phylogenetic results was consistent with the recent reports  <cit> , which confirmed that our results placed the j. curcas proteins into the correct subfamilies. in general, the functions of members of the same clade seem highly but not absolutely conserved across different plants. the functions of some arabidopsis r2r3-myb proteins have been well characterized experimentally, and phylogenetic analysis has identified some functional groups  <cit> . therefore, it is useful to identify the orthologs between plants based on their evolutionary relationships. although the functions of most jcmybs have yet to be characterized, all of the jcmyb proteins clustered into arabidopsis functional groups  which could provide useful information for predicting and studying the functions of jcmybs within each clade. many jcr2r3-mybs were grouped into g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  whose members have been shown to be involved in stress response in arabidopsis , which thus facilitated identifying the jcmybs that may play roles in the response to stress conditions.

jcmyb <dig> is a typical r2r3-myb transcription factor
we isolated one r2r3-jcmyb <dig> gene from j. curcas by race pcr. the targeting experiment confirmed that jcmyb <dig> localizes to the nucleus  and a yeast one hybrid assay suggested that jcmyb <dig> possesses transcriptional activation ability . in addition, two introns of jcmyb <dig> are located up- and down-stream of the sequence encoding the conserved r2r <dig> repeat domain , which was similar to its orthologous in arabidopsis. thus, we inferred that jcmyb <dig> might originate from the same ancestral gene as jcr4s <dig> , at3g <dig>  and at5g <dig> , and some variation occurred in the dna binding domain, though the length and position of the introns remain highly conserved.

besides, jcmyb <dig> was clustered in the g <dig> with other myb proteins from arabidopsis , including atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  the first helix of the second repeat domain is essential for the formation of the ternary complex  <cit> . for atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  some variation of these residues, especially the mutation of the k residues will prevent their interaction with other proteins. according to the alignment of the full length protein of these four mybs, in addition to the highly conserved amino acid residues, we observed that k is replaced by n residue in jcmyb <dig> . additionally, there is another conserved residue q is replaced by e in jcmyb <dig>  therefore, compared with atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  we hypothesized that jcmyb <dig> might play a different role in j. curcas.

jcmyb <dig> is involved in growth regulation, development and tress tolerance
myb proteins have been reported to be involved in response to cold stress in rice. for instance, overexpression of osmyb <dig> significantly enhanced tolerance to chilling and freezing stress in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . ma et al. reported that osmyb3r- <dig> participates in the cold signaling pathway by targeting the cell cycle and a putative dreb/cbf transcription factor  <cit> . moreover, a recent study revealed that an r2r3-myb gene, osmyb <dig>  is induced by salt, cold, and dehydration stress. osmyb <dig> overexpressing plants are more tolerant to salt, cold and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild type plants  <cit> . expression pattern analysis of the  <dig> myb genes identified in soybeans suggests that expression of  <dig> of these genes change upon treatment with cold, salt and/or drought stress  <cit> . gmmybj <dig> displays similarities to the typical r2r3myb proteins reported in other plants and overexpressing gmmybj <dig> causes enhanced tolerance to drought and cold stresses, which indicates that gmmybj <dig> has the potential to be utilized in transgenic breeding lines to improve abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . ptsrmyb isolated from the trifoliate orange shares the highest degree of identity with atmyb <dig> and is up-regulated by abiotic stresses such as dehydration, salt, cold and aba treatment  <cit> .

the expression of jcmyb <dig> was significantly enhanced under salt and cold stress, as well as induced by aba and meja treatment. therefore, we inferred that jcmyb <dig> is involved in aba-dependent cold and salt tolerance and ja-mediated disease resistance signaling pathways. there is significant cross-talk among abiotic stress response mediated by aba and the biotic stress response mediated by ja. arabidopsis mutants with aba insensitivity have the strong resistance against pathogens. on the other hand, excess exogenous aba results in wild type plant susceptibility to the pathogens  <cit> . however, the infection will leads to an increase in the endogenous aba  <cit> . recent studies have reported that many kinds of transcription factors are induced expression by aba and ja . for instance, there is a report that the expression of atmyb <dig> and atmyc <dig> increases under aba treatment, and their over-expression enhances the drought and salt tolerance  <cit> . further studies have revealed that these genes also play important roles in the ja-mediated pathogen resistance signaling pathway, and atmyc <dig> especially has been considered the essential junction between biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> .

in plants, gene expression is determined by the promoter. an analysis of the jcmyb <dig> promoter revealed several stress response elements, including those involved in low temperature stress tolerance, aba responses and stress tolerance, ja-induced plant disease resistance and sa induced pathogen resistance. the expression pattern of jcmyb <dig> and gus staining analysis validated the potential function of these elements. it is a remarkable that  <dig> myb binding sites present in the promoter jcmyb <dig>  which implies that jcmyb <dig> might be regulated by itself or other myb proteins. additionally, the transgenic expression of jcmyb <dig> in arabidopsis enhanced salt and cold tolerance in our study. thus we inferred that jcmyb <dig> functions in the aba-dependent and meja-mediated abiotic and biotic stress responses.

in addition, many growth and development related elements were also found in the jcmyb <dig> promoter, such as light response elements, meristem development, endosperm development and late pollen development. in this study, the jcmyb <dig> showed clear differential expression with high expression in the root and low expression in the stem, leaf and cotyledon. interestingly, the atmyb <dig>  the arabidopsis ortholog of jcmyb <dig>  is highly expressed in the root and hypocotyl, and only lowly expressed in other organs of arabidopsis seedlings. atmyb <dig> regulates differentiation of the non-root hair cell in the root and the non-stomata cell in the hypocotyl  <cit> , atmyb <dig>  another ortholog of jcmyb <dig>  also controls the differentiation of the root hair and the stem hair  <cit> . there is some similarity in the expression of jcmyb <dig> and that of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  which implies that jcmyb <dig> might have a similar function in the control of root cell differentiation, which need further investigation. taken together, these results suggest that jcmyb <dig> is not only involved in cold and salt stress response, but also functions in meja-mediated biotic stress, and regulation of root development and growth. to some extent, these results also showed the feasibility of predicting protein functions through phylogenetic analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study presents a genome-wide identification of the myb gene family in j. curcas. a total of  <dig> r2r3-myb proteins were phylogenetically classified into  <dig> distinct groups and putative function of r2r3-myb proteins was assigned based on phylogenetic results. additionally, jcmyb <dig>  located in the nucleus and activated the downstream gene expression, could enhance the salt and cold resistance of the transgenic plants. the results presented here will be helpful for future studies of the biological functions of jcmyb proteins.
