BACKGROUND
microbes can produce diverse extracellular polysaccharides  for survival in harsh conditions  <cit> . curdlan, a water insoluble β-d- <dig>  3-glucan, can be efficiently produced by agrobacterium sp. atcc <dig> during stressors of low ph and nitrogen starvation  <cit> . because of its special gel and immunomodulatory properties, curdlan and its derivatives can be used as food additives and in pharmaceutic products  <cit> . β-d- <dig> -glucans can be synthesized by bacteria, fungi  <cit>  and plants  <cit> ; however, large-scale curdlan production occurs mainly via fermentation in agrobacterium  <cit> , rhizobium strains  <cit>  and cellulomonas flavigena  <cit> . an efficient curdlan-producing strain, atcc <dig>  whose draft genome sequence is more than 95% homologous to the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c <dig>  genome, is regarded as a model organism for elucidating curdlan biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . using chemical mutant selection, the curdlan biosynthesis operon  was found to contain crda, crds, and crdc genes in the atcc <dig> strain  <cit> . many cultivating conditions including low ph  <cit> , limited nitrogen  <cit> , high dissolved oxygen  <cit>  and adding uracil or cytosine and phosphate salts  <cit>  influence curdlan biosynthesis and accumulation. however, how curdlan biosynthesis gene expression is regulated is unclear.

atcc <dig>  a mutant strain derived from atcc <dig>  had significantly altered intracellular proteins with changes in ph. specifically, at ph  <dig>  , key enzymes of curdlan biosynthesis, such as the catalytic subunit of β- <dig> -glucan synthase , utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase , and phosphoglucomutase  were increased  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times, respectively  <cit> . intracellular ph changes may activate synthesis of a cellular stringent response signal ppgpp to alter formation of acidocalcisome, which helps maintain intracellular ph and ion homeostasis  <cit> . to learn how low ph affects curdlan biosynthesis in an atcc <dig> strain, we analyzed genomic sequences of atcc <dig>  and that of sinorhizobium meliloti , which is an acid-tolerant, symbiotic nitrogen-fixing strain  <cit>  using blast alignment. we found a transcriptional regulator, phrr , expression of this gene increased 5– <dig> times under conditions of low ph  in s. meliloti  <cit> . the phrr gene has a homologous counterpart, agro_ <dig>  in atcc <dig>  both phrr and agro_ <dig> are helix-turn-helix transcriptional factors of the xre-family, which includes hipb of escherichia coli , ch <dig> of rhizobium leguminosarum , and prar of azorhizobium caulinodans    <cit> . the existence of an essential curdlan production regulatory locus other than the crd operon—locus ii—was suggested by stasinopoulos’s group  <cit>  dna sequencing confirmed that the locus ii gene encodes a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulatory protein, crdr, and that agro_ <dig> is the crdr gene  <cit> , unfortunately, whether crdr acts directly to regulate crdasc expression is unclear, so we investigated the role of crdr on crdasc transcriptional activation.

knockout of the crdr 
for agro_ <dig> gene knockout, a  <dig>  bp fragment of the target gene  with up- and down-stream flanking sequences was pcr cloned using primers crdrup- <dig> and crdrdown- <dig>  the amplified fragment, double digested with both saci and hindiii, was inserted into the same sites of puc <dig> to obtain the puccrdr flanking. the gentamicin  resistance gene expression cassette, obtained by pcr amplification with primers  from pex18gm  <cit> , was double digested with bamhi and sali and then inserted into the same sites of the puccrdr flanking to obtain the suicide knockout vector puc19t-crdr . knockout plasmids were transformed with electroporation using an eppendorf micropulser. knockout mutants, selected by screening on lb-agar plates containing 24 μg/ml gentamicin, were confirmed with pcr amplification with  <dig> pairs of primers including crdr- <dig> and crdr- <dig>  crdr- <dig> and crdrcheckgm- <dig>  and crdrcheckgm- <dig> and crdr- <dig> .figure  <dig>

construction of pbqcrdr and pbqncrdr for homogenous agro_ <dig> expression
a 437-bp full-length coding region of crdr was amplified with pcr using the primer pairs crdr- <dig> and crdr- <dig>  with genomic atcc <dig> dna. the amplified crdr fragment, digested with bamhi and saci, was ligated into the pbq vector  <cit> , creating the pbqcrdr vector . to construct the vector for crdr expression driven by its native promoter of crdr, an agro_ <dig> fragment with up- and down-stream flanking sequences was pcr cloned using primers ncrdr- <dig> and ncrdr- <dig>  the obtained  <dig>  bp pcr fragment which was double digested with both saci and xhoi was inserted into sali and saci sites of pbq to create pbqncrdr .

construction of pag vector with gfp expression driven by the crd operon promoter
the predicted crd promoter , which is a 607-bp fragment upstream from the start codon of crda , was amplified from genomic atcc <dig> dna with primers crdapg- <dig> and crdapg- <dig> . the gfp code sequence was amplified with primers gfp- <dig> and gfp- <dig>  from plasmid pegfp  and the two fragments were fused via pcr amplification. the resultant fused fragment, digested with xhoi and bamhi, was inserted into the same sites of plasmid pqe81l to yield pqeag. after digestion with sali, the fragment containing the gram-negative broad host replicating origin and the kanamycin  resistant gene amplified from pbbr <dig>  with primers pairs rep-kan- <dig> and rep-kan- <dig> , was inserted into the xhoi site of pqeag to yield pag .

curdlan fermentation and yield analysis
a two-step fermentation protocol was used to measure curdlan yields. in brief, atcc  <dig> and modified strains were inoculated into test tubes containing 5 ml lb and grown overnight at 30°c with  <dig> revolutions per minute . about 2 ml each of the seed cultures  were transferred into 500-ml flasks containing 100 ml lb with or without iptg  at 25°c, 200 rpm for 4 h. cells were collected by centrifugation  and cell pellets were added to 125 ml curdlan-producing medium in a 500-ml flask which was shaken at 200 rpm. every 24 h for 5 days reaction, 15-ml samples were taken from the culture mixture and samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min to collect pellets. pellets containing both cells and curdlan were resuspended in 15 ml naoh solution  for 2 h. cells pellets were separated by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 5 min and resulting curdlan was precipitated by the addition of  <dig>  mol/l hcl and the ph was adjusted to  <dig> . curdlan was recovered by centrifugation, washed, and dried to a constant weight in an oven .

crdr, crda, crds, and crdc expression analysis using q-rt-pcr
total rna was extracted with an easypure rna kit , according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the quality and quantity of the extracted rna was measured using an ultrospec  <dig> spectrophotometer  at 260 nm. cdna synthesis was performed with a primerscript rt reagent kit  according to the manufacturer’s instruction by using a 6-bp random primers set. selected fragments of crdr, crda, crds, and crdc, which were amplified with primers qcrdr- <dig> & qcrdr- <dig>  qcrda- <dig> & qcrda- <dig>  qcrds- <dig> & qcrds- <dig>  and qcrdc- <dig> & qcrdc- <dig> , were ligated into pmd18-t vectors respectively. then, using those constructs as standard copies, q-rt-pcr quantification was performed using an applied biosystems  <dig> fast realtime pcr system  with sybr premix e*taqii . all samples were run in triplicate  <cit> .

gfp expression
the constructed vector  was transformed into both wild-type atcc <dig> and a crdr mutant . transformed bacterial cells were grown in lb for 12 h and curdlan-producing medium for 72 h at 30°c. gfp expression was observed under an optical microscope , equipped with epi-fluorescence. simultaneously, with excitation of 450–490 nm light, green fluorescence of gfp was measured by a fluorospectrophotometer f97pro  to collect the data of the emission spectrum and relative fluorescence of cells harvested from both bacterial cell -growing and curdlan-producing phases.

expression and purification of  <dig> his-tagged crdr protein
6-his-tagged crdr was expressed in e. coli bl <dig> through pbqcrdr transformation. the resultant strain grew at 37°c in lb medium , and crdr protein expression was induced by adding iptg . the culture was shaken at 30°c for 4 h at 220 rpm. cells were harvested by centrifugation were immediately extracted or frozen at −80°c until they were used. 6-his-tagged protein was purified by affinity chromatography using one-step his-tagged protein miniprep pack  according to the manufacturer’s instruction. purified crdr dissolved in elution buffer was dialyzed with dialysis buffer  overnight in a semi-permeable membrane. protein concentration was measured using an improved coomassie assay with bovine serum albumin  as standard.

dna binding analysis of crdr by emsa
dna fragments containing various lengths of the crd promoter  and ~450 bp upstream of the start codon  of crdr  cela , and crds  named relap celap and crdsp were obtained by pcr amplification with primers listed in table  <dig> respectively, those fragments were purified with a dna gel extraction kit  respectively according to the manufacturer’s protocol. a electrophoretic mobility shift  binding assay was performed as previously described with slight modifications  <cit> . briefly, 10 μl of  <dig> – <dig>  mg/ml purified his-tagged crdr in 4× emsa buffer  was incubated with 10 μl of different purified target dna fragments  in ddh2o at room temperature for 30 min. dna-protein complexes were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and separated at 80 v for  <dig>  h, and the gel was stained with sybr green i and visualized with a uv trans-illuminator .

RESULTS
crdr knockout mutant construction and phenotypes
the crdr knockout mutant was constructed via homologous recombination by transformation of the suicide plasmid, puc19t-crdr . after strains were selected on gentamicin  resistant lb plates, knockout mutants were confirmed with pcr amplification . compared with wild-type  atcc <dig>  which is capsulated in the stationary phase, the crdr knockout strain  produced less curdlan  leading to motile and non-capsulated planktonic forms  in both exponential and stationary phases. crdr expression driven by promoters of t <dig> and native crdr in both atcc <dig> and atcc31749Δcrdr strains, respectively, were obtained by transforming the constructs of pbqcrdr and pbqncrdr . the atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqncrdr strain recovered its curdlan capsulated form of atcc <dig> . with a two-step flask-shaking process, curdlan production over 5 days  <cit>  in  <dig> cultivated strains—atcc <dig>  atcc31749/pbqcrdr, atcc31749Δcrdr, atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqcrdr and atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqncrdr—was compared to assess biomass accumulation and curdlan yields. data show that  the biomass of atcc31749Δcrdr, atcc31749/pbqcrdr and atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqncrdr were higher and that atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqcrdr had less accumulation than wt atcc <dig> during cultivation days  <dig> to  <dig>  by the 5th day, however, cell biomasses of all strains were similar. curdlan yields for atcc <dig>  atcc31749/pbqcrdr, atcc31749Δcrdr, atcc31749Δcrdr/pbq-crdr and atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqncrdr were  <dig>  g/l,  <dig>  g/l,  <dig>  g/l,  <dig>  g/l, and  <dig>  g/l, respectively . curdlan yield for the crdr overexpressed strain  was 38% greater than that of wt. crdr controlled by the t <dig> promoter in atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqcrdr could synthesize curdlan, but yields only reached 18% of wt yields; however crdr controlled by its native promoter in atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqcrdr recovered curdlan yields of crdr knockout. low curdlan yields caused by expression of crdr controlled with t <dig> promoter suggests a more complex regulatory mechanism of crdr expression in the strains. judged from these data, our observation of crdr is consistent with reports to suggest that crdr is an important regulator of curdlan biosynthesis  <cit> .figure  <dig>

expression of curdlan biosynthesis genes responding to crdr overexpression
because crdr is an important regulator of curdlan biosynthesis , we investigated whether crdr activates expression of crd operon genes. q-rt-pcr analysis was used to evaluate the effects of crdr on crda, crds, and crdc  mrna. stationary phase cells favoring curdlan biosynthesis were compared with exponential phase cells favoring cell growth, and crdr native expression was found to be  <dig>  copies/ng total rna in the stationery phase and  <dig>  copies/ng total rna in the exponential phase in atcc31749/pbq. correspondingly, expression of crda, crds, and crdc was at least  <dig> times greater in the stationary phase compared to the exponential phase . mrna of crdr in atcc31749/pbqcrdr, induced by  <dig>  mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  at 30°c for 2 h, was significantly increased compared to that in atcc31749/pbq. corresponding mrna of crda, crds and crdc in atcc31749/pbqcrdr were more than twice greater when strains were cultivated in both growth and fermentation media. data confirmed that crdr promotes curdlan production via activating expression of crd operon genes .table  <dig>

gfp expression controlled by the crd operon promoter 
to confirm the effect of crdr on crd operon gene expression, a shuttle vector of pag bearing gfp driven by the crdp was constructed. pag was transformed into both atcc <dig> and its crdr mutant strain of atcc31749Δcrdr. data indicate that green fluorescence was undetectable by fluorescent microscopy in the crdr mutant strain. in contrast, strong green fluorescence was visible in the wt atcc <dig> strain grown in fermentation media . also, the atcc31749/pag strain was curdlan capsulated whereas atcc31749Δcrdr/pag was non-capsulated and motile . gfp expression detected by spectrophotometry was consistent with microscopic observations that the relative gfp florescence in atcc31749/pag exceeded that in atcc31749Δcrdr/pag at both exponential and stationary phases . because the gfp expression pattern represents expression profiles of crda, crds and crdc in engineered strains of both atcc31749/pag and atcc31749Δcrdr/pag, the effects of crdr expression on gfp expression in those strains indicated that crdr might directly or indirectly interact with the crd operon promoter to regulate expression of curdlan synthetic gene. interestingly relative gfp florescence of exponential phase atcc31749Δcrdr/pag was less than that measured in the stationary phase, suggesting that crdr may synergistically cooperate with other regulators to control crd operon gene expression.figure  <dig>

crdr binding with’ different crd operon promoter regions
bioinformatic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicates that crdr has a conserved dna-binding motif of a helix-turn-helix domain. to confirm that crdr protein can directly interact with the crd operon promoter region, with bsa as a negative protein control, dna-binding analysis was performed with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  with amino terminal 6-his-tagged crdr and dna fragments containing its putative binding sites.  <dig> his-tagged crdr protein was expressed and purified into a single band  with sds-page from e. coli bl <dig> which was transformed with pbqcrdr . the various crdr putative binding fragments, including serial regions of the crd promoter ranging from 607 bp upstream from atg of crda fused with or without of 395 bp downstream of atg of crda  and about 450 bp upstream from atg of crdr,  ppgpp synthetase , cellulose synthase catalytic subunit  and curdlan synthase catalytic subunit , were amplified by pcr with the genomic dna of atcc <dig> as a template . data indicate that  <dig> his-tagged crdr protein cannot specifically bind 450 bp upstream of atg of crdr, rela, cela, and crds, but can bind to different promoter regions of the crd operon .to locate crdr binding site on the crd operon promoter, 607 bp upstream from atg of the crda sequence which can successfully drive gfp expression in the stationary phase , was chosen and the fragment was shorted to 98 bp upstream from the atg of crda to measure binding abilities to crdr. data indicate that those sequences did not reduce binding to crdr as evidenced by a band shift in emsa by mixing with or without crdr . then, the −98 bp fragments upstream from the crda start codon was focused for further analysis by continual shortening to 13 bp upstream of atg of crda. using the 395 bp coding sequence of crda from  <dig> to 395 bp and bsa as a negative dna and protein control, respectively, fragment mobility shifts containing − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> regions of the crd promoter mixed with or without his-tagged crdr were observed and − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> could all bind to crdr. however the greatest gel mobility shift was observed with the − <dig> fragment of crdp.figure  <dig>

discussion
here, we report that the crdr, a homolog of phrr of s. meliloti can activate curdlan synthetic gene expression in agrobaterium sp. atcc <dig>  to our knowledge, ours is the first report to depict molecular functions of the crdr gene. our data indicate that curdlan yield in an over-expressing crdr strain increased 38% compared to the wt strain. also, pbqncrdr transformed to the crdr mutant strain recovered 105% curdlan synthesis of the wt strain . also, when pag was transformed into both crdr mutant and wt strains gfp expression controlled by the crd promoter was undetectable by fluorescent microscopy with low relative fluorescence in the crdr mutant. in contrast, the wt strain had visible green color with high relative fluorescence. finally, q-rt-pcr analysis indicated that crdr is highly expressed in the stationary phase and that overexpression of crdr in the wt strain significantly increased expression of crda, crds and crdc. these data agree with previous reports that crdr is key for regulating curdlan biosynthesis. purified crdr from e. coli bl <dig> can also specifically bind to the promoter region of crd offering initial evidence that crdr is a positive transcriptional regulator of the crd operon in atcc <dig> 

the biomass accumulation in crdr mutant strains was not significantly different from the wt strain, suggesting that the crdr gene is not required for cell growth. microscopic observation revealed that the crdr mutant was nearly curdlan deficient, resulting in mutant cells with non-capsulated planktonic forms. the wt atcc <dig> strain and the complementary strain of the crdr mutant, atcc31749Δcrdr/pbqncrdr, accumulated curdlan in the stationary phase in culture media with low ph and limited nitrogen, leading to cells were capsulated and aggregated . in addition, expression of crdr was higher in the stationary phase than in the exponential phase, and crdr expression further activated curdlan biosynthesis in the atcc <dig> strain to generate a biofilm. this suggests that curdlan may be critical for biofilm formation in atcc <dig> for improving stress tolerance to harsh conditions.

bioinformatic analysis indicated that crdr can be grouped into a conserved xre-family of transcriptional factors that is comprised of hipb in e. coli, phrr in s. meliloti, ch <dig> in r. etli and prar in a. caulinodans   <cit> . apparently, diverse stress can induce expressions of xre-family transcriptional factors. combining with hipa, hipb, a crdr homologue of e. coli that mediates multidrug stress tolerance can bind to its cis elements with conserved sequences of tatccn8ggata . genomic scanning indicated that there is no hipa counterpart in the atcc <dig> strain, and that there were no conservative tatccn8ggata sequences in the promoter region of the crd operon. however, crdp does have three distinct hairpin structures located at the − <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> regions , which are putative crdr binding sites. that purified crdr can bind to an amplified fragment containing the − <dig> region of crdp more than the − <dig>  and − <dig> regions indicates that those region are likely the crdr binding site. hipab is a heterodimer of a transcriptional repressive regulator  <cit> , and crdr may play a different role as a transcriptional activator in the form of a homotetramer or homodimer, which must be confirmed with additional studies. phrr in s. meliloti was affected by low ph, cu <dig> +, zn <dig> + and h2o <dig> stresses  <cit> . expression of ch <dig> in r. etli was promoted by oxidation and osmotic shock  <cit> ; whereas expression of prar in a. caulinodans was increased by low nitrogen  <cit> . primary data from transcriptome analysis obtained from rnaseq indicates that expression of crdr in the curdlan fermenting phase with both low ph and limited nitrogen was twice as great as that in the growing phase of bacterium in lb medium  and q-rt-pcr analysis of crdr expression agreed with rna-seq data . thus, crdr expression should be triggered by stress factors as well.

most organisms within the genera of rhizobium, azorhizobium, bradyrhizobium, mesorhizobium, and sinorhizobium are symbiotic bacteria to various leguminous plants  <cit> . after bacteria enter plant tissues, their environment changes to low ph , with limited nitrogen and sufficient carbohydrates  <cit> , and this environmental shift affects strain morphology and physiology. to survive with limited nitrogen, genes related to bacterial nitrogen fixing and those for low ph tolerance are expressed. transcriptional factors such as phrr and its homologues are instrumental for expression of low ph tolerance genes. also, with abundant carbohydrates from host photosynthesis, bacterial extracellular polysaccharides  are synthesized to produce a biofilm  <cit>  to protect the bacteria from stress. also, the biofilm provides a low-oxygen environment inside the bacteria to support nitrogen fixing reactions. this concept is in agreement with research with prar from a. caulinodans ors <dig>  a homolog of crdr, which can mediate stem nodule formation, regulate expression of reb genes, and increase nitrogen fixation of bacterial strains within stem nodules  <cit> . therefore, biosynthesis of curdlan regulated by crdr may originate from ancestral characteristics for survival within a host plant. currently, detailed regulatory mechanisms of crdr expression, controlled by disadvantageous conditions such as low ph and limited nitrogen remain unknown. however, reports regarding stringent response signalppgpp, which can induce eps biosynthesis and bacterial biofilm formation  <cit>  is worthy of study. we hypothesize that crdr expression may be activated by ppgpp, which accumulates under stressful conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we confirmed that crdr regulates curdlan synthesis by activating expressions of its biosynthetic genes. ours is the first work to identify xer family transcriptional factor which can activate eps biosynthesis. crdr may be a multiple-effect regulator controlling expression of the curdlan synthesis gene in atcc <dig> under oxidative stress/low ph and/or limited nitrogen with abundant sugar. this function of curdlan regulation indicates that curdlan biosynthesis of atcc <dig> under harsh conditions may have evolutionary origin.
