BACKGROUND
seed developmental processes of plants are complex and follow coordinated gene expression programs. some genes are exclusively expressed during seed development  <cit> . understanding the genetics of developmental processes and regulatory networks involved in embryogenesis and seed development is crucial for improvement of seed quality in crop plants. gene expression during seed development has been studied intensively in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana using mutagenesis  <cit>  and microarray analyses . these studies revealed major gene expression changes during seed filling and desiccation, along with distinct expression patterns related to carbohydrate metabolism, lipid biosynthesis and storage protein accumulation. however, the regulatory mechanisms that ensure the proper execution of seed development in a. thaliana and other plants remain largely unknown. furthermore, generalisation of findings regarding gene regulation from model to crop plants is difficult because most major crops have considerably more complex genomes.

oilseed rape , the closest major crop relative of a. thaliana, is the world's second most important oilseed crop. the high-value nutritional oil is also an excellent substrate for biodiesel production, whereas the protein-rich seed meal remaining after oil extraction is a valuable livestock feed. oligonucleotide microarrays constructed for a. thaliana have been used in the past for expression profiling in b. napus, but have not provided optimal signal intensity and reproducibility  <cit> . recently the total number of ests from brassica species deposited in public databases has risen dramatically to more than  <dig>  entries with about  <dig>  from seed developmental stages.  <dig>  ests from seed developmental stages have been used to develop a b. napus cdna microarray for analysis of seed gene expression patterns  <cit> .

an alternative for accurate, quantitative global expression profiling is serial analysis of gene expression , which in contrast to microarray hybridization allows the detection of new transcripts. sage is an expression profiling technique that simultaneously measures the levels of thousands of genes expressed in a given tissue. the method is based on the excision of short tags from poly a+ rnas and end-to-end ligation of ditags to form high molecular weight concatemers. this allows cost-effective high-throughput cloning and sequencing of concatemers. matching of tags to genomic sequences is a critical step in sage data analysis, and normally this requires the availability of high quality genome annotation data  <cit> . sage was first used for quantification of gene expression in human using 13– <dig> bp tags  <cit> . modifications of the original sage protocols producing  <dig> bp tags  and  <dig> bp tags  have been developed to enable more efficient and unambiguous tag-to-gene assignment in higher organisms with more complex transcriptomes. sage is commonly used in animal genomics, but has been increasingly used in plant species and tissues  <cit> . the intention of the present study was to adapt the longsage technique for analysis of global gene expression in b. napus and other similarly complex polyploid plant genomes where the complete genome sequence and annotation are not yet available. a data processing pipeline was adapted by matching b. napus tags via brassica ests to annotated a. thaliana gene loci, including detection of tags matching in sense and antisense orientation.

RESULTS
b. napus seed longsage libraries
two longsage libraries were produced from b. napus seeds harvested at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, respectively. a total of  <dig>  clones from the  <dig> dap library yielded  <dig>  ditags , while  <dig>  sequence traces from the  <dig> dap library yielded  <dig>  ditags  . the relatively low average number of tags per clone resulted from a high number of cloned empty vector plasmids . the vector plasmid pzero  was designed to prevent cloning of empty vector by using a lacza-ccdb fusion cdna insert that should destroy bacteria containing only the vector. however, as described by other authors  we found that pzero could efficiently re-ligate without containing inserts. thus, pcr screening of plasmid libraries for clones containing an empty vector might considerably reduce total sanger sequencing costs and increase total tag sample sizes in longsage transcription profiling experiments.

comparison of longsage and real-time rt-pcr analysis
a good correlation was observed between expression levels estimated by longsage and real-time rt-pcr for most of the selected genes , although some minor differences in estimated fold-change were observed . this could arise from the more selective specificity of real-time rt-pcr for transcripts derived from closely-related gene loci, since specific rt-pcr primers were designed from contigs of b. napus ests putatively derived from different b. napus gene loci. furthermore, real-time rt-pcr may be more sensitive in detecting low abundant transcripts than longsage under the experimental conditions and sequencing depth applied in the present study.

transcript diversity
average tag frequencies for the two analysed seed libraries differed significantly . whereas tags with medium frequency  were more abundant in the  <dig> dap library, the  <dig> dap library was considerably more enriched for high copy-number tags with a frequency ≥ <dig>  nine unique tags with ≥ <dig> counts each represented  <dig> % of the total tag number at  <dig> dap, whereas the  <dig> tags with ≥ <dig> counts each at  <dig> dap comprised only  <dig> % of the total tags. accordingly, the relative diversity of tags was greater at  <dig> dap than at  <dig> dap. we detected 48%  more expressed genes at  <dig> dap than at  <dig> dap , which is consistent with the number of different tags observed in each of the two libraries.

to validate the longsage method and estimate the diversity of transcripts, longsage tags derived from selected tags with 2– <dig> counts in the  <dig> dap library were used as primers for rt-pcr in combination with anchored oligo-dt primers. in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases a pcr product was amplified and sequenced that aligned in blastn analysis with brassica or a. thaliana ests or cdnas. a further validation was performed with  <dig> different longsage tags that had  <dig> to  <dig> counts in the  <dig> dap library and matched members of the a. thaliana 2s storage gene family or ests/cdnas from the brassica napin gene family. in all cases the pcr amplification products, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length, were related to brassica napin genes or other protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family protein genes . a high diversity of 3' termini of clones were obtained using the same napin tag primer, with up to 14% divergence, within 200– <dig> bp of the 3' untranslated region , from up to  <dig> clones per amplicon. interestingly, diverse 3'-utr sequences were also obtained using different napin tag primers, with up to 30% divergence, within  <dig> bp of the 3'-utr, from  <dig> clones. these observations suggest that a high number of distinct protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family protein genes or transcript variants are expressed in b. napus seeds. also these data support the increasing recognition of the high complexity and variability of 3' utr regions in genes from higher organisms  <cit> .

based on the cdna library production using polya+ trapped mrna, longsage tags are expected to match at the anchoring enzyme site closest to the 3' end of full-length ests expressed in sense orientation . however, only  <dig> % of the matched tags in the sense est dataset were matched in the last canonical position. there are numerous possible explanations for the high frequency of tags matching a non-canonical position. in particular, they could arise from  cloning artefacts caused by partial digestion with the anchoring enzyme nlaiii during sage library preparation,  alternative transcript variants with varying length derived from one gene locus, or  est cloning artefacts creating chimeric est molecules derived from two or more different genes. also, due to partial est sequences present in the dataset, a non-canonical position might be falsely annotated to the canonical position. except in the third case, non-canonical tags are still valid tags for accurate annotation. we attempted to reduce annotation artefacts  by removing putative chimeric ests from analysis . this increased the ratio of tags matched to the canonical position of oriented brassica ests from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. however, even after filtering out putative experimental artefacts using this approach, only 77% of all  <dig>  ests matched by tags in the canonical position are matched exclusively at this position. instead, 23% of these individual ests are additionally matched by tags at other non-canonical positions , suggesting that the usage of alternative transcripts  is a common mechanism. in other words, a high diversity exits in the 3' utr of many expressed transcripts, as has been described before in humans  <cit> . no information exists about transcription start points for polya+ containing transcripts expressed in antisense orientation. therefore different proportions of matched antisense tags might be expected at canonical and non-canonical positions. in contrast to the tags matched in sense orientation, only  <dig> % of tags were matched to canonical positions for the tags matched in antisense orientation.

comparison of the most abundantly expressed tags and assigned genes
tag-to-est matches based on  <dig>  tags were assigned to a total of  <dig>  a. thaliana gene loci at both time-points . about 85% of the tags  were assigned exclusively to a single a. thaliana gene locus. the other 15% of the tags matched  <dig> to  <dig> loci, with some tags matching more than  <dig> genes exhibiting a polya-like homopolymer composition. due to the positioning of the anchoring enzyme restriction site close to the polya tail in some transcripts, these contained stretches with up to  <dig> adenosine bases derived from phylogenetically unrelated genes. other tags matching more than  <dig> genes were clearly derived from groups of phylogenetically related genes. for example, the tag catgaacagtttcatcaacga matched to six different members of the histone gene family .

on the other hand, some a. thaliana loci were matched by up to  <dig> different b. napus tags via the brassica ests. moreover, some loci were not only matched by different tags, but these tags also matched at different positions within one particular matched est molecule. these multiple matches underline the complex paleopolyploid structure of the b. napus genome in comparison to a. thaliana  <cit> . for example, the  <dig> a. thaliana gene loci of the 2s seed storage protein family were matched by  <dig> different tags, including  <dig> of the  <dig> most abundant tags, at  <dig> dap. due to this complexity, a three-step procedure was applied for calculating average values of the relative abundance of gene expression, based on the tag-to-gene matching results for each single a. thaliana gene locus. in a first step, the measured counts were evenly distributed to the matched gene loci if a tag matched more than one gene locus. in a second step, tag counts were added together if different tags matched the same gene locus. in a final step the summed tag counts for each gene locus were normalized to a total tag count of  <dig> , <dig> for both libraries and the relative abundances were calculated.

average cumulative counts and frequencies for the  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes at  <dig> and  <dig> dap are shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the most abundant transcripts at  <dig> dap, with  <dig> % of all matched tag counts, correspond to the a. thaliana senescence-associated cysteine-type protease sag <dig> , which was also among the  <dig> most highly-expressed genes at  <dig> dap. two protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer family proteins  were also among the  <dig> most highly expressed genes at both time-points. other highly expressed transcripts at  <dig> dap are a number of catalytic enzymes and other genes that are involved in diverse biological processes. at  <dig> dap, transcripts related to the four closely-related a. thaliana 2s seed storage protein genes showed the highest counts, with a cumulative abundance of about 10%. other highly expressed transcripts at  <dig> dap are related to other storage proteins , protease inhibitor or lipid transfer proteins and genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. for many of the highly expressed genes several different tags were found  matching to a large number of different ests  that were aligned to a particular a. thaliana gene at <1e- <dig> 

differentially expressed genes
 <dig> tags showed differential expression at p ≤  <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig> dap. these represent only  <dig> % of the accepted unique tags, but  <dig> % of all normalized tag counts.  <dig> of  <dig>  differentially expressed unique tags were successfully matched to  <dig> a. thaliana genes , and these differentially expressed genes were matched by  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all matched tags in  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap libraries, respectively . this indicates that, in the  <dig> dap library but not in the  <dig> dap library, many of the differentially expressed transcripts are highly abundant. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were upregulated at  <dig> dap and  <dig> genes were upregulated at  <dig> dap. the  <dig> most abundant differentially expressed genes at  <dig> dap include  <dig> genes encoding proteases,  <dig> genes coding for protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family proteins and  <dig> genes coding for defensin-like family proteins. sag <dig> is the most abundant differentially expressed gene at  <dig> dap with  <dig> % and is down-regulated about 3-fold at  <dig> dap with  <dig> % total abundance. the  <dig> most abundant differentially expressed genes at  <dig> dap cover a narrower range of genes coding for 2s seed storage proteins, oleosins, cruciferins and protease inhibitor proteins. the  <dig> most abundant differentially expressed genes are the 2s seed storage proteins  <dig> to  <dig> and cruciferin  <dig>  the 2s seed storage protein  <dig> is the most abundant differentially expressed gene with  <dig> % abundance and is up-regulated 374-fold compared to time-point  <dig> dap. from all  <dig> genes showing a significantly different expression level at the two time-points,  <dig> were exclusively expressed at  <dig> dap and  <dig> at  <dig> dap . a number of cases were observed where different matched a. thaliana genes with similar functional annotations were expressed at the two different time-points, e.g. different a. thaliana genes belonging to the large cysteine protease and lipid transfer protein families were exclusively expressed at  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, respectively. in contrast to cruciferin a  and cruciferin  <dig> , cruciferin  <dig>  was exclusively expressed at  <dig> dap.

expression data produced by microarray hybridization for  <dig> developmental stages of a. thaliana were downloaded from ebi arrayexpress  and expression profiles were compared with expression profiles obtained by longsage for b. napus seeds using hierarchical cluster analysis and spearman's rank correlations according to lu et al.  <cit> . both b. napus sage data sets showed weak correlations with expression value estimates from a. thaliana microarray data sets with the highest correlation for the seed developmental stages atge_ <dig>  and atge_ <dig> . sample atge_ <dig> was derived from a. thaliana seed stage  <dig>  early to late heart stage embryos and sample atge_ <dig> from seed stage  <dig>  late heart to mid torpedo embryos. embryos dissected from sample  <dig> dap were classified to be at the mid torpedo stage and from sample  <dig> dap to be at the early curled cotyledon stage. genes that were differentially expressed between two different a. thaliana seed stages  were identified at different stringencies and compared with the  <dig> genes identified to be differentially expressed between  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap in b. napus as described above. from the  <dig> genes identified by longsage  <dig>  were not represented on the microarray chip. from the remaining  <dig> genes a maximum of 29%  overlapping genes were detected that were mainly highly abundant genes . the percentage of overlapping genes identified here between the two different crucifer species during morphological similar seed developmental stages appears to be high when taking into account that the correlation of microarray hybridization and longsage data analysis has been found to be low  even when using the same rna preparations and longsage has been characterized to be more efficient at identifying differentially expressed tags than microarray technology  <cit> .

gene ontology enrichment analysis
a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig>  matched genes were expressed at  <dig> dap, while  <dig>  genes were expressed at  <dig> dap .  <dig>  of  <dig>  genes  were expressed at both time-points. figure  <dig> gives a comparison of go categories that are statistically over-represented for the genes expressed at  <dig> dap compared to all other a. thaliana genes. from the  <dig> genes matched by statistically significant differentially expressed tags between  <dig> and  <dig> dap,  <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> dap and  <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> dap. statistically enriched go terms found for the differentially expressed genes either up-regulated at  <dig> or up-regulated at  <dig> dap were calculated using goeast  <cit>  and details of the results are provided in additional file 2: enriched_go_terms_490_differentially_expressed_genes.xls. within the category 'biological process', the go terms 'developmental process', 'localization' and 'metabolic process' are enriched at both time-points. generally, go terms that are statistically enriched at the highly general information level  <dig> are similar for the two time-points. comparison of statistically enriched go terms for  <dig> differentially expressed genes at  <dig> and  <dig> dap reveals their involvement in seed maturation, regulation of meristem organization and photomorphogenesis, seed coat development, water and fluid transport, cell-cell signalling, cell wall modification and glycerolipid, neutral lipid, acylglycerol, triglyceride, and carbohydrate metabolic processes at  <dig> dap, and in protein processing, protein targeting, photosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid localization, storage and lipid metabolic processes at  <dig> dap.

genes matched in sense and antisense orientation
in the  <dig> dap library,  <dig> of the  <dig> most abundant tags matched in sense as well as in antisense orientation to the brassica est dataset, oriented based on the a. thaliana proteome. the same was true for  <dig> of the  <dig> mosxt abundant tags at  <dig> dap. in most of these cases  <dig> to  <dig>  ests were matched by a single tag in one direction, whereas only  <dig> to  <dig> ests were matched by the same tag in the opposite direction. a detailed analysis of these matches revealed that in all cases the smaller fraction of matched ests were chimeric sequences composed of two regions, derived from different gene loci, that aligned to the a. thaliana proteome or to b. napus full-length cdnas in different orientations. these apparently chimeric ests may represent cloning artefacts derived from tail-to-tail or head-to-head ligations during cdna preparation for est library production. in some cases a putative chimeric composition was also found for individual ests, with two different regions derived from different genes being aligned in sense and antisense orientation to the a. thaliana proteome or to oriented b. napus full-length cdnas. to remove these putative chimeric ests from our analysis, tag-to-est-to-a. thaliana gene locus matches were only accepted if at least  <dig> tag-matched brassica ests matching a particular a. thaliana locus were found. in addition, tag-to-est-to-gene matches of particular tags matching in sense as well as in antisense orientation were only included in the analysis if the frequency of ests matched in one direction was at least 1% of the frequency of ests matched in the other direction. after removal of putative chimeric ests, the number of accepted tags that were successfully matched via brassica ests to a. thaliana genes was reduced strongly from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , due to the exclusion of many low-copy ests from the analysis. the occurrence of chimeric ests in databases has been documented previously. for example, hillier et al.  <cit>  found chimeric ests in a dataset of  <dig>  human ests at a frequency of up to  <dig> %. the strategy we applied resulted in removal of all  <dig> chimeric ests that were identified by manual analysis of the  <dig>  ests matched by the  <dig> most abundant tags in the two longsage libraries.

based on the tag-to-gene matching strategy described above it was found that  <dig> % of all matched tags matched a. thaliana genes via oriented brassica ests in antisense orientation . in the  <dig> and  <dig> dap libraries, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the respective genes were matched exclusively by sense tags . on the other hand,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all genes were matched exclusively by antisense tags at  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, respectively, while  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the genes were matched by both sense and antisense tags. genes expressed with high abundance in sense orientation, and particularly members of complex gene families, often also showed coexpression of antisense transcripts at a lower frequency . a detailed analysis of tags matching to the four 2s seed storage proteins of a. thaliana  was performed by aligning them to brassica spp. napin cdnas and genomic napin sequences. this revealed that some tags matched in antisense orientation to highly conserved regions of napin transcripts, derived from multiple b. napus loci, whereas other tags matched in sense orientation to highly diverse regions of napin transcripts derived from a limited number of b. napus loci.

detection of napin-related sense and antisense transcript expression by real-time rt-pcr
at  <dig> dap, a high number of tags matched in sense orientation to brassica ests that were similar to a. thaliana proteins containing the aai_ss domain . this protein domain is found in the alpha-amylase inhibitors  and seed storage  protein subfamily including plant lipid transfer proteins, seed storage proteins and trypsin-alpha amylase inhibitors. at  <dig> dap the most abundantly expressed tags were matched via brassica ests in sense orientation to the four a. thaliana 2s seed storage proteins 1– <dig>  at4g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> . the four a. thaliana 2s seed storage proteins share 75–91% amino acid  sequence identity with each other. the four 2s seed storage protein genes and  <dig> other protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family protein genes were also among the genes with the highest tag counts matched in antisense orientation .

for comparison of sage results with quantitative real-time rt-pcr detection, two sets of primers and their antisense reverse-complemented sequences were derived from sage primer amplified napin 3'-termini  and from assembled contigs of  <dig>  b. napus ests aligning with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig> to a. thaliana 2s seed storage protein  <dig> . one primer set  was designed specifically for the major cluster of b. napus assembled est contigs most similar to the a. thaliana 2s seed storage proteins 1– <dig> . another set of primers  was designed specifically for the minor cluster of b. napus assembled est clusters grouping in-between the four a. thaliana 2s seed storage proteins and the related protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer  family protein at5g <dig> . at5g <dig> represents the next closely related protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family protein gene in a. thaliana, which like other more distantly related proteins of this large family  exhibits an aai_ss domain and shares about 53–57% aa identity with the a. thaliana 2s seed storage proteins 1– <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the expression profile from days  <dig> to  <dig> after pollination from seeds for sense and antisense napin and napin-related transcript expression. the coexpression of sense and antisense transcripts was confirmed for a minor subgroup of napin-related transcripts by strand-specific real-time rt-pcr, but not for the major napin transcript group as indicated by longsage.

discussion
b. napus and a. thaliana are members of the brassicaceae family and exhibit around 87% conservation of their protein-coding sequences  <cit> . based on this close phylogenetic relationship, the tag-to-gene matching strategy applied in this study for longsage expression profiling in the non-model plant b. napus uses the information available for the well-annotated proteome of the model species a. thaliana. our results show that expression profiling can be achieved for b. napus seeds using publically available est resources and the annotated proteome of a. thaliana for tag-to-gene assignment.

major factors influencing the accuracy of the first step of the sage analysis are the sequencing error rate, the tag length and the transcriptome complexity. the accuracy of sage depends on the ability to unambiguously match the tags to the genes of origin. theoretical calculations show that > <dig> % of  <dig> bp longsage tags are expected to occur only once in large genomes such as the human genome, which is about twice the size of the b. napus genome, with the remaining tags matching duplicated genes or repeated sequences  <cit> . in a polyploid plant genome the proportion of duplicated genes is generally considerably higher, and our strategy of matching tags via ests to a related model plant proteome will not per se allow differentiation between closely related duplicated genes. however, matching to multiple members of gene families still allows biological inferences from the longsage data, since the predicted function in each case is identical. in our case only around 90% of longsage tags were assigned to a unique a. thaliana gene. this underlines the highly duplicated nature of the b. napus and a. thaliana genomes  <cit>  and reflects the well-documented ancient hexaploidization events in major angiosperm phyla  <cit> . despite this we found no example where a b. napus tag matched multiple a. thaliana genes with apparently unrelated functions. this suggests that the matching strategy we applied is specific enough with  <dig> bp b. napus tags to draw biological conclusions on the expression levels of functionally related gene families in b. napus seeds. raising the blastx e-value stringency to 1e- <dig> for matching of brassica ests to the a. thaliana proteome was found to reduce the average number of genes per gene family to which the observed tags were assigned. however, this also resulted in a higher number of tags that could no longer be assigned to a. thaliana genes and thus could not be annotated . for longsage analysis from b. napus we found an e-value of >1e- <dig> useful; this is also the cut-off value used by ncbi in the unigene database for est-to-protein matching to create clusters of transcript sequences that are expected to come from the same transcription locus.

the development of oilseeds can be broadly divided into three phases,  the pattern formation/cell proliferation phase,  the maturation phase, with lipid and storage protein accumulation, and  the desiccation phase. at  <dig> dap b. napus seed has reached the end of phase  <dig> and is beginning the transition to phase  <dig>  while at  <dig> dap the seed is in the middle of the maturation phase. the most abundantly expressed gene detected at  <dig> dap, sag <dig>  is a cysteine protease expressed during leaf senescence in a. thaliana  <cit> . in b. napus sag <dig> is encoded by two orthologous copies, bnsag12- <dig> and bnsag12- <dig>  involved in leaf senescence and seed development, respectively. bnsag12- <dig> and bncysp <dig>  a cysteine protease with around 91% identity to bnsag12- <dig>  are expressed in the early phase of b. napus seed development within the inner integument of the testa and are predicted to function in the disposal of proteins in the inner integument cells committed to programmed cell death  <cit> . other genes encoding proteases and protease inhibitor genes are also strongly represented within the  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes at  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, e.g. a δ-vascular processing enzyme  at  <dig> dap. vpes are cysteine-type proteases which were originally discovered to be responsible for maturation of seed storage proteins. in a. thaliana δ-vpe was found to be involved in developmental cell death during embryogenesis  <cit> . in general, proteases are considered to be key regulators of plant development involved in post-translational modification or activation of proteins and enzymes of diverse biological processes. proteases play a role both in general protein turnover and in highly specific regulation of plant development. dong et al.  <cit>  also described an elevated expression of genes coding for subtilisin-like protease and vacuolar processing enzymes , consistent with seed endosperm development, along with early expression of lipid transfer proteins that are required for embryo pattern formation  <cit> . the high transcription levels of genes encoding seed storage proteins are also consistent with the results of dong et al.  <cit>  based on cdna cloning and northern blot expression profiling. on the other hand, our longsage analysis revealed that transcripts encoded by the peroxidase gene at4g <dig>  had a high abundance at  <dig> dap and a subsequent drop in expression at  <dig> dap, whereas northern blot analysis appeared to reveal the opposite expression pattern. such differences might be due to different specificities and resolutions of the two techniques, e.g. cross-hybridization of northern blot probes with other closely related peroxidase transcripts.

antisense transcripts and sense-antisense transcript pairs  were found to be prevalent at both developmental stages investigated. antisense transcripts were observed earlier in a. thaliana and rice cdna/est databases and confirmed using tag-based expression profiling approaches like sage or massively parallel signature sequencing  <cit> , with matching to the sequenced genomes. in some of these studies it was noted that the sense and antisense transcripts of an overlapping nat pair  tend to be expressed in different tissues or different conditions. furthermore, in cases where the sense and antisense transcripts of a nat pair were expressed in the same library, one type of transcript was usually more abundant than the other. one speculation is that cis-antisense transcripts could be involved in down-regulating the expression levels of their target mrna to achieve a low protein concentration by interfering with the transcription of their sense transcript. due to the matching strategy we applied, the sense-antisense pair matches we found to the a. thaliana proteome might either indicate natural sense-antisense pair expression from one b. napus gene, or a concurrent expression of sense and antisense transcripts from paralogous b. napus genes. either way, the results clearly indicate that a significant number of antisense transcripts are expressed during b. napus seed development. the coexpression of sense and antisense transcripts was confirmed for a subgroup of napin-related transcripts coding for proteins from the large group of protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family by strand-specific real-time rt-pcr. although real-time rt-pcr confirms the detection of antisense transcripts that are related to protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein  family proteins by longsage, it also indicates that the use of the proteome of a. thaliana for annotation of tag-matched b. napus transcripts in case of diverse gene families limits the resolution and the detailed analysis of the genome and transcriptome structure and availability of more genetic resources for b. napus will help to increase the resolution in the future. the detection of transcripts for a diverse number of genes in antisense orientation by longsage at both time-points suggests strong involvement of antisense transcripts in regulatory processes during b. napus seed development.

the comparison of longsage and real-time rt-pcr data suggests that the sequencing depth applied in this experiment limits the longsage detection to transcripts with medium to high copy numbers in b. napus seeds. on the other hand, recent developments in next-generation sequencing  technologies allow ultra-deep transcriptome profiling using transcript tag-based techniques  that can realistically achieve transcriptome saturation and accurate quantification of low-copy transcripts. the data analysis techniques developed in the present study represent a valuable platform for future ngs-based transcriptome tagging studies in brassica species. as suggested by shendure  <cit> , such approaches may ultimately replace microarrays as the method of choice for quantitative global transcriptome profiling as a basis for genetical genomics or systems genetics approaches. in the present study we have demonstrated that tag-based transcriptome profiling can also be effectively applied in a non-model, complex polyploid plant species.

CONCLUSIONS
this study underlines the potential of transcript tagging approaches for gene expression profiling in brassica crop species via est matching to annotated a. thaliana genes. the data processing pipeline adapted by matching b. napus tags via brassica ests to annotated a. thaliana gene loci enabled differential expression profiling of during seed development in the complex b. napus genome, and furthermore detected an unexpectedly high proportion of est tags matching in antisense orientation. this suggests a strong involvement of antisense transcript expression in regulatory processes during b. napus seed development. limits of tag detection for low-abundance transcripts can today be overcome by ultra-high throughput sequencing approaches, so that tag-based gene expression profiling may soon become the method of choice for global expression profiling in non-model species.
