BACKGROUND
recent significant progress in short read sequencing and computer technologies that can handle large volumes of short read data using high-speed cpus with increased memory has enabled the assembly and determination of a bacterial genome in single laboratories. using these technologies, several attempts have been made to determine various bacterial genomes such as those of helicobacter acinonychis  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , and bacillus subtilis laboratory strains  <cit> . there are fundamentally two different approaches for assembling bacterial genomes from short read data  <cit> , namely, de novo assembly and reference guided assembly . in this paper, we apply our assembly pipeline that combines de novo assembly and reference guided assembly in order to determine the b. subtilis natto genome sequence.

the first genome sequence of the b. subtilis strain marburg  <dig>  <cit> , the best characterized gram-positive bacterium, provided a great gain to microbiology research. although several derivatives of b. subtilis  <dig> have recently been sequenced using srs data  <cit> , domesticated strains propagated in the laboratory over time lack some traits of the original strain, such as insertion sequences, plasmids  <cit> , and the ability to produce γ-pga and hence mucoid biofilm formation  <cit> .

the traditional japanese food natto  is made from soybeans fermented without salt by the bacterium b. subtilis natto starter strain . at least three kinds of commercial natto starter strains are available in japan. they are classified as b. subtilis natto closely related to the laboratory strain b. subtilis marburg  <dig>  which has about  <dig>  protein-encoding genes in a  <dig>  kbp genome  <cit> . natto is an ideal food because it can be easily prepared, it has a complete set of nutrients, and it can be stored via its production of fungicidal antibiotics  <cit> . many studies have attempted to describe the complex process by which natto is produced, a process that can be divided into several steps, including secretion of proteases on the surface of soybeans, incorporation of digested amino acids, and synthesis of γ-poly-dl-glutamic acid , the major constituent of a viscous biofilm  <cit> . furthermore, γ-pga was identified as an extracellular polymer that can enhance biofilm formation  <cit> .

extensive biochemical and molecular genetic studies have been conducted on the genes and enzymes involved in natto fermentation  <cit> . a limited number of genetically characterized gene homologues, such as pgsbca   <cit> , degq   <cit>  and comqxpa  <cit>  are also present in the genome of b. subtilis marburg  <dig>  this laboratory strain does not produce capsular pga, suggesting that highly coordinated regulation of both gene expression and physiological conditions during growth on the surface of soybeans is required for high-quality natto starter strains.

recently, it has been revealed that the inability of the laboratory strain jh <dig> of b. subtilis to produce γ-pga was due to two nucleotide changes  <cit> :  a single nucleotide substitution in the promoter region of degq; and  a single nucleotide insertion in the coding region of swraa. the introduction of the degq and swraa alleles from a wild b. subtilis strain ro-ff- <dig>  into the b. subtilis jh <dig> strain was necessary and sufficient to allow γ-pga production and consequent formation of a mucoid colony phenotype. we confirmed that the b. subtilis natto genome sequence determined in this study contains the same alleles in the promoter region of degq and the coding region of swraa as the strain ro-ff- <dig>  therefore, this natto strain does not contain the thymine-to-cytosine nucleotide substitution in the degq promoter region, and the single adenine nucleotide insertion in the coding region of swraa, which induced the pseudogenization of swraa in  <dig> strain according to the latest annotation for the updated release of  <dig> genome  <cit> .

we conducted a multiple genome comparison among five closely related bacillus species including the b. subtilis natto sequence determined in this study. it was revealed that there were many insertions and deletions but no significant rearrangements, and gene orders were well conserved among the five genomes with two large syntenic segments detected. furthermore, in the operon structure of the four quorum-sensing genes comq, comx, comp and coma, our natto genome sequence revealed that the region of dna starting at the 5' end of the coding sequence of comq and ending at the middle of the coding region of comp via comx was significantly divergent and contained almost no sequence similarities to b. subtilis marburg  <dig>  as previously observed in b. subtilis natto naf <dig> strain  <cit> . the amino acid sequence of comx, containing a pheromone peptide, is identical for the two natto strains best <dig> and naf <dig>  together with the fact that comp and coma were identified as regulators of biofilm formation along with the degsu, degq and swra regulators of γ-pga production  <cit> , these observations are consistent with the interpretation that the comqxp gene module determines a b. subtilis natto-specific cell density signaling system.

RESULTS
mapping short read sequence data to the reference genome
genomic dna was extracted from b. subtilis natto best <dig>  <cit>  and whole genome shotgun sequences were obtained using the illumina genome analyzer. a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads of  <dig> bp length were generated, with the average length of inserts of paired-end reads at  <dig> bp. to control each step in the following experiments, we re-sequenced b. subtilis marburg  <dig>   <cit>  .

the generated paired-end reads were mapped to the published b. subtilis reference genome of marburg  <dig> using mapping and assembly with qualities  software  <cit> . of the total reads,  <dig> % could be mapped to the reference genome with 131-fold sequencing coverage across the entire genome. this fold coverage rate is in the mid range between an extremely high level of coverage  used for de novo assembly of a helicobacter acinonychis genome  <cit>  and a low level of coverage  used for the assembly of a staphylococcus aureus sequence  <cit> .

at each base, a quality score was statistically calculated based on the reads using maq. the quality scores describe the confidence that the base is correctly called. a total of  <dig> % of all mapped bases had a quality score of  <dig> or higher, and  <dig> % of all the mapped bases had a quality score of  <dig> or higher. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  a quality score of  <dig> was used as the cut-off value, and a consensus sequence was finally produced from the maq alignment of short reads of best <dig> against marburg  <dig> reference genome. we called this consensus sequence the reference-guided draft.

genomic dna was extracted from b. subtilis natto best <dig> isolated from miyagino-based natto, and b. subtilis marburg  <dig> . the short paired-end reads were generated by the illumina genome analyzer ga <dig>  the generated paired-end reads were mapped to the marburg  <dig> reference genome using maq software. at each base, a quality score was statistically calculated based on the reads using maq. the quality scores describe the confidence that the base is correctly called.

de novo assembly from short read data and sorting generated scaffolds
all short paired-end reads generated by the illumina genome analyzer were input into the de novo assembly software velvet  <cit> . a total of  <dig> scaffolds  with an average length of  <dig>  bp were produced for b. subtilis natto best <dig> with a predefinedcut-off rate. the total size of the produced scaffolds was  <dig>  kbp and that of  <dig> scaffolds with length greater than  <dig> kbp is  <dig>  kbp, that is,  <dig> % of all the scaffolds we used for the next step of sorting scaffolds. all statistics regarding the generated short reads and the produced scaffolds are summarized in table  <dig>  n <dig> scaffold sizes shown in table  <dig> indicate the increased difficulty of de novo assembly of best <dig> compared to strain  <dig>  this was mainly due to the presence of insertion sequences in best <dig>  which strain  <dig> lacks.

all short paired-end reads generated by the illumina ga <dig> were input into the de novo assembly software velvet and a set of scaffolds produced. the scaffolds greater than  <dig> kbp were aligned to the marburg  <dig> reference genome. n <dig> indicates the scaffold length such that 50% of the de novo assembled sequences lies in scaffolds of this size or larger.

scaffolds greater than  <dig> kbp were sorted using anchors along the marburg  <dig> genome and aligned to the marburg  <dig> reference genome. anchors, which are short, well-conserved subsequences between each scaffold and the reference genome, are calculated using murasaki, a multiple genome comparison program  <cit> . the link plot between unsorted scaffolds and the marburg  <dig> reference genome and the link plot between sorted scaffolds and the reference genome are displayed in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> scaffolds greater than  <dig> kbp,  <dig> contained anchors of the marburg  <dig> genome, and the remaining  <dig> scaffolds displayed no similarity to the marburg genome. one scaffold of the remaining  <dig> was identified as a plasmid with the same sequence as that of pta <dig>  <cit> . the  <dig> scaffolds were sorted and placed at the corresponding locations according to anchors along the marburg  <dig> genome. our annotation shows that the unsorted scaffolds contain insertion sequences, transposons, phages and non-coding rna sequences.

combination of two assembly results and completion of the assembly by pcr
we combined the de novo assembly with the reference-guided draft to fill the gaps among de novo assembled scaffolds using the following three steps.

sorted scaffolds were concatenated by aligning to the reference-guided draft using the fast anchor finding algorithm murasaki  <cit>  and assembled into large scaffolds as follows:  two adjacent scaffolds that overlapped were merged into one larger scaffold );  <dig> gaps were filled in this manner.  if a subsequence was inserted in the reference-guided draft between two adjacent scaffolds, such scaffolds and the inserted subsequence were concatenated into one scaffold );  <dig> gaps were filled in this manner.

 the remaining gaps were experimentally determined by pcr amplification. for both ends of each scaffold, the specific primers were designed and the gap regions amplified. the size of the pcr products were estimated by gel electrophoresis, enabling determination of the length of all remaining  <dig> gaps. most of these products were successfully sequenced using a sanger sequencer .

the pcr experiments confirmed the correct order of all sorted scaffolds that were calculated by alignment to the marburg  <dig> strain and the concatenations of scaffolds using the above-mentioned steps  and . by using these three steps, one large scaffold  was finally constructed from  <dig> scaffolds. the  <dig> unplaced scaffolds greater than  <dig> kbp fitted into the remaining gaps.

the  <dig> scaffolds less than  <dig> kbp were also analyzed against the final draft, and of these scaffolds,  <dig> were found in the draft as subsequences.

all solexa reads have been deposited in the read archive at ddbj http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ with accession number dra <dig>  and the final genome sequence and annotation have been deposited in ddbj with accession number ap <dig> and ap <dig> 

sfii physical map
a detailed sfii restriction map was experimentally constructed for best <dig>  <cit> . we compared the sfii restriction sites between our draft and the experimental physical map as indicated in figure  <dig>  the number of sfii restriction sites in both maps was identical and sfii fragments were similar in size within experimental errors, approximately ± 3%, except three large ones. in particular, the differences in size of fragments containing large gaps at the coordinates  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> between our draft and the experimental physical map strongly indicate that some undetermined scaffolds, approximately  <dig> kb in sum, might be included in these remaining gaps.

natto production genes
several genes required for soybean fermentation have been of central interest in the genetic, biochemical, and physiological investigation of b. subtilis natto. since γ-pga was identified as an extracellular polymer that can enhance biofilm formation, and the ability of a wild b. subtilis strain ro-ff- <dig> to produce γ-pga was due to two nucleotide substitutions  <cit>  from the  <dig> strain, we confirmed these nucleotide substitutions in our genome draft of b. subtilis natto  strain. in the  <dig> strain that is incapable of producing γ-pga, a single nucleotide was substituted from cytosine to thymine in the promoter region of degq, and a single adenine was inserted into the coding region of swraa. figure  <dig> clearly demonstrates that two nucleotide substitutions from the  <dig> strain are present in the natto best <dig> genome. the alignment of dna sequences containing the swraa coding region between natto best <dig> and marburg  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig> . it clearly reveals that a single nucleotide insertion in  <dig> strain broke down the open reading frame  of swraa and induced the pseudogenization of swraa in  <dig> strain, which was previously shown to result in the production of a non-functional allele of swraa  <cit> . the thymine-to-cytosine nucleotide change in the degq promoter region was also observed in the alignment between the degq promoter regions of strains best <dig> and  <dig> ), and the position of the nucleotide change corresponds to the - <dig> binding site. previous work  <cit>  has revealed that the promoter with a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide change increased the transcription of degq and led to the formation of a mucoid colony morphology.

within the operon structure of the four quorum-sensing genes comq, comx, comp and coma, significant large variation in the dna region starting at the 5'-end of the coding region of comq and ending in the middle of the coding region of comp via comx was observed between best <dig> and  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  this large variation was also previously observed in b. subtilis natto naf <dig> strain  <cit> .

interestingly, the amino acid sequences of comx containing the pheromone peptide between best <dig> and naf <dig> are completely identical. these observations are consistent with the interpretation that the comqxp gene module determines a b. subtilis natto-specific cell density signaling system.

plasmid sequences
best <dig> contains two plasmids, pbest195l and pbest195s, as described in the methods section. we have previously revealed that these plasmids are not required for natto production by best <dig>  <cit> . a  <dig> kbp plasmid, pls <dig>  similar to pbest195l  <cit>  and pta <dig>  similar to pbest195s  <cit>  have been reported. we screened strains in which both plasmids were absent in order to be able to apply future genetic and molecular cloning works to this b. subtilis natto strain. only the strain missing pbest195l was obtained and this strain was subjected to the present sequencing. as expected, pbest195s was shown to be nearly identical to pta <dig> 

polyketide synthesis gene
an operon structure for a series of polyketide synthesis genes from pksb to pksr which begins with transcriptional regulator pksa and ends with hydroxylase of polyketide pkss is completely deleted in b. subtilis natto . each b. subtilis strain, as well as every bacterium, generally contains its own polyketide synthesis operon.

in contrast, only part of genes to synthesize another polyketide, plipastatin, in b. subtilis marburg  <dig>  <cit>  are present in the b. subtilis natto genome. the operon structure of five genes from ppsa to ppse in  <dig> is shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  absence of internal ppsb and ppsc genes in best <dig> suggests that excision via intrachromosomal recombination between two highly similar regions in ppsa and ppsd occurred. the present partial deletion in best  <dig> is consistent with a similar deletion formation of the plipastatin operon of marburg  <dig> recently reported  <cit> .

insertion sequence
b. subtilis marburg  <dig> lacks typical insertion sequences  <cit> . in contrast, many b. subtilis natto strains harbor various copies of the insertion sequence  is4bsu <dig>  <cit>  and is <dig>  <cit> . our natto draft sequence clearly demonstrated the presence of is4bsu <dig>  and is <dig> . in addition, we discovered is643-like transposases , isbma2-like transposases , islmo1-like transposases , and several putative transposases. their locations are summarized in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the natto is is considered to be frequently transposed within the host genome, being consistent with our unpublished observation that the high frequency of is appearance in best <dig> colonies causes inability to ferment soy proteins. is-insertion into genes relevant to natto production might be more plausible than spontaneous mutation induced in these genes, since mutation hot regions have not yet been identified in marburg  <dig> genomes  <cit> . actual transposition activity of those in best <dig> strain remains to be experimentally scrutinized.

gene annotation and multiple genome comparison
the gene annotations along with three bacillus species' comparisons are available on our natto genome browser http://natto-genome.org/, based on the generic genome browser gbrowse  <cit> .

our orthologous gene analysis using the oasys program  <cit>   which accurately detects one-to-one orthology relationships between natto best <dig> and marburg  <dig> revealed that  <dig> % of  <dig> predicted genes in best <dig> are one-to-one orthologous to genes in  <dig>  two genes are in-paralog,  <dig> % are deleted in  <dig>   <dig> % are inserted in best <dig> , and  <dig> % of genes present in  <dig> are deleted in best <dig>  further, we calculated comprehensive sequence alignments for those  <dig> orthologous genes between b. subtilis natto best <dig> and marburg  <dig>  the list of all the alignments is available in additional file  <dig>  data s <dig>  and on the natto genome browser.

we conducted multiple genome-level comparisons among five closely related bacillus species, marburg  <dig>  best <dig>  b. amyloliquefaciens  <cit> , b. licheniformis  <cit> , and b. pumilus  <cit> . these five bacillus species exhibited significant genome similarities among all bacillus species genomes. our multiple genome comparisons revealed that there were numerous insertions and deletions but no significant rearrangements. gene orders were well conserved among the five genomes and two large syntenic segments, that is defined as a conserved segment descended from a common ancestor without rearrangements, were detected by using the accurate orthology mapping program, osfinder  <cit>  . the link plot of five bacillus species genome comparison, and the dot plot of a pairwise comparison of orthologous genes between best <dig> and marburg  <dig>  b. amyloliquefaciens, b. licheniformis, and b. pumilus respectively, are displayed in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> 

discussion
there was no single standard b. subtilis natto strain similar to b. subtilis marburg  <dig> whose derivatives have been developed in laboratories worldwide  <cit> . most information relevant for natto production is deduced from comparative studies in which standard marburg  <dig> is employed. our group has intensively studied best <dig>  <cit>  and the draft sequence determined in this study is consistent with accumulated data reported for other b. subtilis natto strains. the present sequence-determined strain best <dig>  originally isolated from commercial natto, can become a standard, safe and beneficial b. subtilis natto bacterium in terms of a more appropriate host for future applications such as the mass production of useful materials. on the other hand, b. subtilis natto best <dig> strain possessed insertion sequences not only expected ones such as is4bsu <dig> and is <dig> but also ones previously unidentified. this is in sharp contrast to b. subtilis marburg  <dig> that lacks typical insertion sequences. the strain-specific is feature was observed in our previous study where a b. subtilis natto strain best <dig> apparently lacked is4bsu <dig>  <cit> . together with our present sequence-based conclusion, presence of is and their population in the genome can draw attention on plausible gene regulations for maintenance and exclusion of is.

validation of our genome assembly method from short read data
our assembly pipeline  used for determining the best <dig> genome sequence was validated in two manners.

 <dig>  a draft sequence using our short read re-sequence data of marburg  <dig> and the previous release  <cit>  of  <dig> genome sequence as reference was assembled by our assembly method. the assembled sequence was compared with the updated release  <cit>  of  <dig> genome sequence by using blastz, a whole genome alignment program  <cit> , to see how many bases are matched.

 <dig>  the generated short read data from best <dig> was divided into two subsets, a draft sequence was assembled using one subset by our assembly method, and short reads in the other subset were mapped into the assembled sequence to see how many reads can be mapped.

the result for the validation test  is that the rate of mismatch in the alignment between the assembled sequence by our method and the updated release of  <dig> genome is  <dig> % in our draft sequence and  <dig> % in the updated release of  <dig> while the rate of mismatch between the previous release and the updated release of  <dig> genome is  <dig> % in the previous release and  <dig> % in the updated release. thus, our draft sequence improved the previous release of  <dig> genome. on the other hand, the result for the test  is that  <dig> % of reads in one subset were mapped to the draft sequence assembled from reads in the other subset. these two validation results demonstrated the proper reliability of our assembly method and an adequate quality of our genome draft, while the sfil profile differences between restriction site maps could still leave a possibility of some misassemblies in our draft.

srs ability to detect snps and large variation
first, the precise identification of a single nucleotide substitution in the promoter region of degq and a single nucleotide insertion in the coding region of swraa between the  <dig> and best <dig> strains confirmed the ability of srs technology to detect snps. second, our assembly pipeline that combines de novo assembly and reference guided assembly was proven to be capable of detecting large variations in dna region starting at the 5'-end of the comq coding region and ending in the middle of the coding region of coma via comp. a simple mapping method that maps the generated short read data onto a published reference genome cannot cover the species-specific regions divergent from a reference genome. third, our assembly pipeline also succeeded in determining the complete deletion of an operon structure of polyketide synthesis genes, as well as many insertions of is copies such as is4bsu <dig>  fourth, our assembly pipeline succeeded in simultaneously assembling an additional b. subtilis specific plasmid sequence.

assembly limitation using srs data: analysis of scaffold ends
we conducted sequence analyses and annotations for both ends of all scaffolds greater than  <dig> kbp in order to clarify the reason why de novo assembly terminated at the positions by the velvet assembler.

as illustrated in figure  <dig>  about 70% of the ends of all scaffolds generated by the velvet assembler are repeat sequences such as trnas, iss and phages. although strain  <dig> is known to have no iss and is therefore easier to assemble than best <dig>  the previous attempt to assemble several laboratory  <dig> derivatives using srs  <cit>  could not be completed with one connected scaffold. this indicates the difficulty and limitation of genome assembly using short read sequence data to span across longer repeat sequences such as insertion sequences, transposons, and non-coding rna sequences. more systematic analyses regarding the limitations of de novo assembly from short read data using various short read assemblers have been done in an experiment involving the pseudomonas syringae genome assembly  <cit> , and also reported in a technical note on the illumina website.

CONCLUSIONS
our research provided two distinguished features: a short-read assembly pipeline that combines de novo assembly and reference guided assembly, and determination of the whole genome sequence of bacillus subtilis natto with detailed analysis of a set of genes related to natto production. using a short-read assembly pipeline and pcr experiments to determine the remaining gaps, one large scaffold  was finally constructed. the usefulness of our genome assembly method was proven in terms of single polynucleotide polymorphism  detection in γ-pga production genes for soybean fermentation, and significant sequence divergence detection in quorum-sensing genes related to soybean fermentation. the assembled genome sequence revealed that the b. subtilis natto strain completely lacked a polyketide synthesis operon, and disrupted plipastatin production operon, and possessed previously unidentified transposases. our natto sequence demonstrated the number and locations of insertion sequences dissimilar to b. subtilis marburg  <dig> that possesses no typical insertion sequences. a multiple genome comparison among five closely related bacillus species revealed a number of insertions and deletions but no significant rearrangements, with gene orders well conserved among the five genomes and two large syntenic segments detected.

the determined genome sequence of b. subtilis natto, gene predictions and annotations with the three bacillus species' comparisons are available on our natto genome browser http://natto-genome.org/.
