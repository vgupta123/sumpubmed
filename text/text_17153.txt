BACKGROUND
a clear understanding of the genetic architecture of body composition is important in chicken breeding. genetic selection over the past  <dig> years has produced commercial meat-type  chickens with a higher yield of breast meat, which is also accompanied by increased body fatness  <cit> . breast muscle yield is the most important carcass component in meat-type chickens because of the high premium paid by consumers. however, excess accumulation of body fat is undesirable because it reduces the efficiency of feed utilization and it adds the additional expense of trimming unwanted fat during processing  <cit> . higher consumption of excess dietary saturated fat contributes to artherosclerosis in humans. therefore delineating major genes that underlie carcass traits has important implications for both agriculture and human health.

crosses from extreme strains and/or breeds of chickens have been used to map quantitative trait loci  for body composition traits including fatness  <cit> . despite the importance of dissecting the genetic basis of body composition in the chicken, body composition qtl mapping studies to date have been restricted to delineating the main  genetic effects. incorporation of epistasis and sex-dimorphism into qtl analyses has the potential to identify novel epistasis qtl, and sex-specific and sex-antagonistic qtl  <cit> . physiological differences between sexes can influence gene expression  <cit> . therefore, sex-specific qtl are to be expected for carcass traits, especially abdominal fatness. abasht et al.  <cit>  have mapped an abdominal fatness qtl on chicken chromosome  <dig>  that exhibits sexual dimorphism. furthermore, several sex-specific qtl for body composition have been reported in humans and in rodent models  <cit> .

empirical evidence suggests that fat and body composition traits are influenced by epistasis  <cit> . earlier studies by carlborg et al.  <cit>  and yi et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that joint assessment of regions on the genome, on either the same chromosome or different chromosomes have significant effects on traits. therefore, inclusion of gene-gene interactions in the statistical model is essential in providing comprehensive mapping of the genetic factors that underlie body composition traits. modeling of these gene interactions has been challenging because of the large number of variables  <cit>  and the decreased power of the statistical analysis  <cit> . these drawbacks can be ameliorated by utilizing a bayesian model selection method which models main, epistatic and gene-environmental effects simultaneously  <cit> . the bayesian approach has been used successfully to identify several epistatic qtl associated with growth and body composition in mice  <cit> .

herein, we used yi et al.'s  <cit>  bayesian model selection method to comprehensively investigate main, sex-specific and gene-gene interaction effects of body composition traits in a chicken population divergently selected for high or low growth rate.

RESULTS
main effect qtl
the trait means and standard deviations for the f <dig> resource population are presented in table  <dig>  the main-effect qtl affecting carcass traits are summarized in table  <dig>  seventeen qtl with significant linkages were observed on  <dig> chromosomes . a qtl for the pectoralis  major weight was found on gga <dig> at  <dig> cm and for pectoralis minor weight on gga <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  nevertheless, adjusting p. minor for bw at  <dig> wk only confirmed the qtl on gga <dig> and  <dig>  a thigh + drumstick qtl was located on gga <dig> at  <dig> cm. seven qtl for abfw were identified on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  adjusting abfw with bw at  <dig> wk revealed additional qtl for abfy on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the tdw and tdy qtl co-localized with an abfy qtl on gga <dig>  the qtl effect in terms of genotypic mean placements and the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained are also shown in table  <dig>  the main effect qtl explained from  <dig> to 14% of the phenotypic variance. the p. major and p. minor yields qtl on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  each explained about 6% of the phenotypic variance. the abfw qtl on gga <dig> and gga <dig> contributes ~27% of the phenotypic variance.

qtl × sex interactions
the presence of significant qtl by sex interactions in the model for all parameters presently considered suggested either sex specificity or sex-influenced qtl. we identified several sex-specific and sex-antagonistic qtl which are listed in supplementary  <dig>  sexual dimorphism was observed for both p. major and p. minor yield on gga <dig> and  <dig>  whereas, all qtl detected for p. major were female-specific, both male-and female-specific qtl were identified for p. minor qtl. multiple qtl were detected on the same chromosome in some cases, but for different sexes. for example, a male-specific p. minor yield qtl was detected on gga <dig> at  <dig> cm, whereas, the female- specific qtl was detected at  <dig> cm. the phenotypic variances explained by these sex-specific qtl ranged from  <dig> to 27%.

epistatic effects
significant qtl by qtl interactions were found for both muscle yield and abdominal fatness traits. each epistatic qtl explained ~ <dig> to 25%  of the phenotypic variance. a highly significant epistatic qtl  for abfy explained approximately 25% of the phenotypic variance. a region on gga <dig>  interacts with gga <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and explains a large  proportion of the phenotypic variance for abfy. the same position on gga <dig> interacts with other regions of the genome to influence p. major weight and yield. in addition to inter-chromosomal interactions, an intra-chromosomal interaction affecting p. major yield was found between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm on gga <dig>  significant interactions were found between qtl for abfy on gga <dig> and  <dig> . fat weight on the other hand was strongly influenced by interactions between gga <dig> and  <dig>  gga <dig> and <dig>  gga <dig> and  <dig>  gga <dig> and  <dig>  and gga <dig> and  <dig> .

discussion
most traits of economic and biomedical importance are influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. using techniques that allow for inclusion of epistasis and sex-specificity in a qtl model enables a better understanding of the genetic regulatory mechanisms that underlie body composition. chicken breast muscle is comprised of two distinct muscle groups: the p. major and the p. minor. a significant main- effect qtl for bmy was detected on gga7; yet analysis of each breast muscle indicates that p. major was the only trait contributing to bmy on gga <dig>  the location of the p. major qtl is similar to that reported for bmy  <cit> . the qtl region for p. major yield contains several genes . we identified three novel qtl for p. minor weight on gga <dig>   <dig> and 17; however after adjustment with bw at  <dig> wk, the qtl on gga <dig> and  <dig> met the level of significance. the p. minor yield qtl on gga <dig> explained approximately 6% of the phenotypic variation. the pre-b-cell leukemia transcription factor  <dig> , a homeobox gene is located within this qtl region. most studies evaluate breast meat as a single trait  <cit> . the current study suggests that these traits should be treated independently since they are influenced by different qtl. we also identified a qtl for tdw and tdy at the same location  on gga <dig>  the  <dig> cm region of gga <dig> harbors the mitogenic activated protein kinase kinase  <dig> , defender against cell death  <dig>  and myst histone acetyltransferase  <dig>  genes.

intensive genetic selection of meat-type chicken during the the last  <dig> years has led to rapid somatic  growth and a concomitant increase in abfy  <cit> . abdominal fatness is a complex trait affected both by genes, environmental factors , and their interactions. in the present study, we found qtl for abfw on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the qtl for abfw on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were similar to the location reported for these traits in other chicken populations  <cit> . when abfw was corrected for bw at  <dig> wk, abfy qtl were confirmed on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  and novel ones were identified on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the abfy qtl on gga <dig> co-localized with the tdy qtl, while the position of the abfy qtl on gga <dig> is similar to a suggested fatness qtl  by lagarrigue et al.  <cit> . the abfy qtl on gga <dig> harbors thyroid hormone responsive protein  which is a nuclear protein expressed in lipogenic tissues , and is involved in the transduction of hormonal and dietary signals for increased lipid metabolism  <cit> . the thrsp gene is differentially expressed in the high and low lines; and mutants of thrspα are associated with abf in chickens  <cit> . the thrsp gene also modulates tumorigenesis in human breast cancer  <cit> . positional candidate genes that underlie the gga <dig> abfy qtl include inhibitor of growth, family member  <dig> , rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor  <dig>  and ankyrin repeat domain  <dig> . the abfy qtl on gga <dig> harbors the insulin gene and insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  gene. a biallelic marker in the chicken igf <dig> gene appears to be associated with growth and carcass traits  <cit> .

sex-specific qtl
several studies in other species point to sex-bias, sex specificity or sex antagonism in qtl analysis  <cit> . the approach allows us to test for interactions between qtl and sex. a qtl by sex interaction with a bayes factor  ≥  <dig>  was considered as sex specific  or sex antagonistic . a sex antagonistic fatness qtl has been reported in chickens divergently selected for abdominal fatness  <cit> . sex-antagonistic qtl for abfy were found on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  male-specific qtl for abfy on gga <dig> and gga <dig> were similar to those reported by jennen et al.  <cit>  and mcelroy et al.  <cit> , respectively. however, the abfy qtl on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are unique to the hg × lg cross. there were several female-specific qtl affecting p. major yield, and contrarily several sex-antagonistic qtl affecting p. minor yield. some fatness qtl were also found to be sex-antagonistic in the current study. the male-specific qtl for abfw was within the confidence interval of the sex-antagonistic qtl for abdominal fatness reported by abasht et al.  <cit> . sex-specific qtl and their genetic inter-relationships have been reported for human obesity and lipid levels  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying sex-specific, sex influenced or sex-antagonistic effects are unknown although the influence of sex hormones on the regulation of the genes that underlie these qtl is the first evident hypothesis. other parameters showing sex-dimorphism  may exert further additional controls on their own. the fine mapping strategies utilized to identify major genes that underlie qtl would depend on whether qtl effect is additive, epistatic, sex-specific or sex-antagonistic.

epistatic qtl effects
by definition, a complex trait is affected by many genes, each with a small effect, the environment and gene by environment interactions. however, in most instances the summation of the additive effects of each single-locus cannot explain all the phenotypic variation of a particular trait. the dependency of one locus upon another, referred to as epistasis, also contributes towards the phenotypic variation. the inclusion of epistatic effects through interactions of different qtl regions  in qtl mapping allows for the detection of novel loci. epistatic qtl explained between  <dig> to 25% of the phenotypic variation. epistasis qtl involving positions on gga  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with body composition traits in the current study. an earlier study utilizing a white leghorn × red jungle fowl cross identified many epistatic pairs that affected both early and late growth  <cit> . they argued that, the degree of divergence between their populations could be the reason for the measured epistasis. gene interactions may be the norm rather than the exception. limited studies on epistasis qtl are due principally to the lack of statistical methods with sufficient power to detect them, rather than their lack of existence. other studies have described the effect of epistasis on fatness in mice  <cit> . genes that underlie interacting qtl may interact biologically or may code for enzymes involved in common pathways  <cit> . several positional candidate genes at the gga <dig> 284- <dig>  cm region  could be interacting with other genes on gga <dig> and  <dig> to affect abdominal fatness in meat-type chickens. it appears that some of the candidate genes that underlie qtl for abfy are also associated with breast cancer in humans  <cit> . therefore candidate genes within the qtl regions identified in this study should be investigated for their biologically significance to body composition in chickens and to obesity and cancers in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
we have studied the main genetic and interactive effects of trait loci that affect body composition in chickens. our studies have confirmed some known qtl http://www.animalgenome.org/qtldb/chicken.html and identified some novel qtl in the high and low growth line intercross. the bayesian statistical strategy has allowed us to concurrently explore epistatic, sex-specific and sex-antagonistic qtl. identification of genes that underlie qtl regions and their interactions as demonstrated by significant qtl-qtl interactions should provide insight into an elaborate network of genes and will help to elucidate their role in body composition and fatness in chickens and possibly breast cancer in humans.
