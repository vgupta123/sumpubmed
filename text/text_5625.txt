BACKGROUND
the shedding of plant organs is a highly coordinated developmentally regulated event that can occur in different contexts throughout the plant life cycle  <cit> . organ shedding is important for both plant vegetative and reproductive development, including abscission of leaves, branches, whole flowers, floral parts, seeds and immaturely aborted or ripe fruit. in particular, cell separation that occurs during fleshy fruit abscission and dry fruit dehiscence facilitates seed dispersal, the final stage of reproductive development, and therefore governs important characters in many crop species. for fruit to be shed, cell separation must occur in a precise location timed to optimize dispersal under the most favourable conditions. for crop species, if fruit are shed too early or late, economic consequences can be significant. whereas our understanding of the evolutionary context for this phenomenon is mainly limited to model systems such as tomato and arabidopsis, less is known about the mechanisms underlying fruit abscission in non-model crop species in general and, monocot species in particular.

oil palm is a tropical perennial monocotyledonous species in the family arecaceae with an extraordinarily oil rich fleshy mesocarp, which is the number one source of edible vegetable oil worldwide. in addition, potential use of palm oil as a biofuel is predicted to cause constraints on the worldwide supply of edible palm oil and increase the pressure for higher yields and an expansion of cultivatable areas. while conventional breeding schemes have allowed increases in yield of palm oil up to 1% per year, non-synchronized ripening and subsequent shedding of the ripest fruit before harvest limit yield gains  <cit> . in addition, the difficulty to schedule regular harvests due to non-synchronized fruit shedding results in a labour intensive logistics that increases overall production costs. furthermore, several original characters of oil palm fruit shedding warrant further detailed investigations. in particular, the two-stage process involving primary and adjacent abscission zones , plus the extraordinary low amount of methylated pectin and high levels of polygalacturonase  activity, collectively suggest that divergent mechanisms may underlie the cell separation process that leads to fruit shedding in this monocotyledonous species  <cit> . finally, the only organ observed to shed in this palm species is the ripe fruit. flowers and immature fruitlets from many species are naturally thinned by organ abscission in response to nutritional status to optimized reproductive success, whereas this phenomenon is not observed to any extent in oil palm. indeed, the oil palm maintains all fruit on a bunch until ripening related signalling takes place to induce ripe fruit abscission.

while examples of organ shedding in plants are diverse, the common model proposed is mainly based on studies with eudicotyledons  <cit> . firstly, the development of the abscission zone  takes place at the base of subtending organ to be shed. secondly, as the az develops, it must become competent for cell separation events required for organ abscission. indeed, once the az develops, it responds differently from adjacent tissues to the signals that induce cell separation  <cit> . after the az becomes competent for separation to be induced, cellular activity, in particular the expansion of the golgi vesicles and activation of the endomembrane system with the release of hydrolytic enzymes to the apoplast leads to the degradation of the middle lamella and cell separation  <cit> . an important feature of the model is the induction of the genes encoding cell wall hydrolytic enzymes targeted to modify and degrade cell wall components for separation to occur. the expression of these genes is often induced by ethylene and inhibited by auxin, characteristics that correlate with the positive and negative effects of these hormones on the abscission process respectively  <cit> . despite the central importance of the mechanisms that allow changes in adhesion of adjacent cells to take place with such temporal and spatial precision, our understanding of these events even in model organisms is limited.

pg gene expression and activity are common features of organ abscission, observed in bean, tomato, peach and sambucus nigra <cit> . pg activity depolymerises the homogalacturonan backbone of pectin and while pg transcripts and activity increase in various species during the abscission process, they can also be induced by ethylene or inhibited by auxin  <cit> . in tomato, there is a single pg transcript  expressed during fruit ripening, while up to four other pgs  are expressed in the flower/fruit pedicel az associated with abscission  <cit> . interestingly, the down-regulation or knockout of tfpg results in a decrease in pectin depolymerisation, but surprisingly no change in fruit softening which suggests other components are involved  <cit> . furthermore, down-regulation of fruit tfpg has no effect on the timing or rate of leaf abscission, indicating a specific function of this enzyme during fruit ripening but not organ abscission  <cit> . in contrast, silencing of the abscission tapg <dig> expression delays abscission and increases break strength of the az  <cit> . overall, these experiments suggest that while pgs are important for processes during both ripening and abscission, the same genes may not be responsible and there are other factors involved in abscission. indeed, there are up to  <dig> and  <dig> pg genes in arabidopsis and rice respectively, many with overlapping expression domains  <cit> . at least four of the arabidopsis genes have expression profiles correlated to cell wall loosening and cell wall dissolution events during floral organ abscission  <cit> . furthermore, adpg <dig>  adpg <dig> and qrt <dig> have been shown to have overlapping functions during different cell separation processes. adpg <dig> and adpg <dig> are essential for silique dehiscence, while adpg <dig> and qrt <dig> contribute to floral organ abscission, and all three genes contribute to anther dehiscence, suggesting precise combinations of pg activities may be necessary during the cell separation events underlying these different processes  <cit> .

a previous study revealed a large increase in pg activity in the oil palm az in the base of the fruit during cell separation events that lead to fruit abscission  <cit> . our main objective in the present study was to identify pg genes that could be responsible for this activity observed during fruit shedding. we have performed a detailed expression analysis of  <dig> genes that encode pgs in the base of the oil palm fruit. pg sequence diversity in the fruit tissues and their profiles of expression during fruit ripening and during ethylene induced abscission contrasts with that observed in tomato, suggesting some functional divergence underlying these processes in this monocotyledonous fruit species. the results of a phylogenetic analysis of egpg <dig> with pgs with known functions and/or expression profiles from various species will also be discussed in relation to divergence that may have occurred between eudicots and monocots, in particular between fleshy and dry fruit species.

RESULTS
ethylene induced oil palm fruit shedding experimental system
previous studies published on oil palm fruit shedding were done with material transported by airfreight from plantations in malaysia to a laboratory in the united kingdom where the experiments were performed  <cit> . in order to determine precisely the timing of events that occur during abscission, our first objective was to set up an experimental system that could be used in a local field setting to eliminate problems that could arise due to the time and conditions required for storage and long distance shipment of the fruit. based on the results of earlier studies with oil palm, ethylene was implicated as the main signal that induces cell separation in the primary az of the oil palm fruit  <cit> . therefore, to synchronize fruit shedding, we treated spikelet explants with ethylene in airtight boxes . the first experiment examined the ethylene dose effect on the induction of cell separation in the primary az of ripe fruit  treated for  <dig> h . an increase in the number of fruit shed  was observed in spikelets treated with  <dig>  μl l- <dig> ethylene, while at  <dig> μl l- <dig>  100% of the fruit underwent cell separation in the primary az. this experiment confirmed the use of  <dig> μl l- <dig> as an effective concentration for our studies as used previously  <cit> . in addition, the experiment also confirmed the two-stage separation process  during which separation first occurs within the predetermined primary az, followed later by separation events in adjacent azs  <cit> . the concentration of  <dig> μl l- <dig> was used in further experiments to compare fruit separation at different stages of development . spikelets of fruit at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap were treated and shedding was quantified at time intervals up to  <dig> h after treatment. no fruit were observed to shed at  <dig> and  <dig> h. fruit at  <dig> dap were only observed to shed after  <dig> hours of treatment, while  <dig> dap fruit and  <dig> dap fruit began to separate after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of treatment respectively. in air controls, only the  <dig> dap fruit were observed to shed at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h . these experiments define the time frame during which cell separation must occur for oil palm fruit shedding to take place, and suggests an importance of developmental factors that influence the response to ethylene.

polygalacturonase gene family expression in the oil palm fruit tissues and the identification of the egpg <dig> transcript induced in the az prior to fruit shedding
a 35-fold increase in polygalacturonase  activity was reported to occur in the az during fruit shedding  <cit> . furthermore, pgs are implicated in cell separation underlying organ separation in many species. in this context, our next objective was to identify pg candidate genes responsible for this large pg activity observed during cell separation events in the az. briefly, our approach involved searches of available databases for sequences similar to known pgs, including locally derived  <dig> pyrosequencing transcriptome data, followed by designing of specific primers for each sequence identified to test, along with degenerate primers, to amplify from a mixture of cdnas derived from fruit tissues treated or not treated with ethylene, or from genomic dna . overall, our searches resulted in the identification of  <dig> putative non-redundant pg sequences,  <dig> of which contained either a partial or complete glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  pg signature domain and were retained for further studies . from the  <dig> sequences, rt-pcr analysis revealed that  <dig> non-redundant pg transcripts were expressed in the az of oil palm fruit and a detailed analysis of their expression in fruit tissues during ethylene induced abscission was performed. the  <dig> transcripts are egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig>  egpg <dig> and egpg <dig> 

to analyze expression, qpcr analysis was performed with tissue samples from the ethylene experiments described above . the results confirmed the rt-pcr analysis in that each of the  <dig> primer pairs successfully amplified a pg sequence from the oil palm fruit az, but also from the adjacent pedicel or mesocarp tissues before and after ethylene treatment . the profiles of transcript abundance accumulation in the az can be grouped into the following three main categories: i) five transcripts increase significantly , ii) four transcripts decrease significantly  and, iii) five transcripts have no significant change in abundance in the az during ethylene treatments  respectively. by far the most abundant pg transcript detected with the most dramatic increase in abundance in the az is that of egpg <dig> . egpg <dig> transcript increases approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fold in the az after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of ethylene treatment respectively. in contrast, egpg <dig> is also highly expressed in the mesocarp sampled from the upper portion below the apex of the untreated fruit, but only increases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fold after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of ethylene treatment respectively . finally, egpg <dig> is faintly detectable in pedicel tissue before ethylene treatment, and increases at a lower magnitude during the ethylene treatments compared to that observed in the az.

an overview of pg gene expression reveals that the three adjacent fruit tissues respond differently to the ethylene treatments . in the mesocarp below the apex of  <dig> dap fruit, the egpg <dig> transcript represents 95% of the total pg transcript before ethylene treatment, then increases to 99% after  <dig> h of ethylene treatment . in contrast, in the az of fruit prior to ethylene treatment, egpg <dig> is the most abundant  followed by egpg <dig>  and egpg <dig>  and egpg <dig> , whereas egpg <dig>  represented only 4% of the total pg transcript detected. by contrast, egpg <dig> accounts for 99% of the pg transcript in the az after  <dig> h of ethylene treatment. in the pedicel, egpg <dig>  and egpg <dig>  are the most abundant pg transcripts after  <dig> h ethylene treatment, while the egpg <dig> transcript accounts for only 7% and 4% total transcript in untreated and ethylene treated fruit respectively. our findings indicate that egpg <dig>  the most abundant pg transcript detected, is spatially and temporally differentially regulated in the three adjacent fruit tissues examined. indeed, egpg <dig> accounts for the majority of the total pg transcript detected in the mesocarp, and more notably undergoes a dramatic increase in abundance preferentially in the az prior to the onset of separation observed after  <dig> h of ethylene treatment .

during our ethylene experiments, we observed that  <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit do not separate without treatment with ethylene , while in the presence of ethylene they first separate after  <dig> h and  <dig> h respectively, and only after  <dig> h of ethylene treatment are the majority of the fruit shed . by contrast, the  <dig> dap fruit treated with air in the presence of ethylene absorbing material  will begin to undergo cell separation after  <dig> h and will completely separate after  <dig> h . to determine whether egpg <dig> transcript accumulation coincides with these observations, we examined the expression of egpg <dig> in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit in the presence or absence of ethylene . the results reveal a close correlation of the accumulation of the egpg <dig> mrna with the timing of shedding of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit. indeed, egpg <dig> has very low relative expression in untreated  <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit compared to  <dig> dap, and after  <dig> h of ethylene treatment, the increase is  <dig>  fold in the  <dig> dap fruit compared to only  <dig>  fold and  <dig> fold in the  <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit respectively . after  <dig> h, egpg <dig> transcript increases  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  fold in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit respectively, while after  <dig> h of ethylene treatment, the egpg <dig> transcript is increased  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  fold in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit respectively.

in situ analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of egpg <dig> during ethylene induced fruit shedding
whereas the qpcr analysis of egpg <dig> transcript accumulation correlates well with the timing of cell separation events that occur in the base of the oil palm fruit, the az samples that were used for the expression analysis include a mixture of all three tissues including the az and the margins of the adjacent pedicel and mesocarp tissues . to examine whether both the temporal and spatial expression of egpg <dig> correlates with the cell separation events in the az that lead to fruit shedding, in situ hybridization analysis was performed. firstly, we used a combination of bright field, polarized light and epifluorescence microscopy to clearly distinguish the localization of the egpg <dig> transcript within the az cells, compared to the adjacent mesocarp and pedicel tissues . with polarized light, the az cell layers are well defined in addition to the lignified vasculature in all the tissues . in contrast, epifluorescence microscopy mainly detected the lignified vasculature, predominantly in the pedicel and the mesocarp . in the base of ripe fruit before ethylene treatment, the egpg <dig> transcript was neither detected in the az, nor in the lower margin of the mesocarp or upper margin of the pedicel tissues . by  <dig> h after ethylene treatment, the egpg <dig> transcript increased in abundance preferentially in the az cell layers, including the parenchyma cells and the undifferentiated xylem cells of the vascular bundles . by contrast, no egpg <dig> transcript was detected or was only present in relatively lower amounts in the adjacent pedicel and mesocarp tissues. at higher magnification of the boundary region between the pedicel and the az, the egpg <dig> transcript clearly accumulates in the az cells while it remains at very low or undetectable amounts in the adjacent pedicel cells . in contrast, the control hybridizations with ribosomal rna  sense and antisense probes revealed a more even distribution of rrna throughout the pedicel, az and mesocarp tissues when compared to egpg <dig> . furthermore, the sense strand control with egpg <dig> also had a less intense signal than the antisense . as a comparison, in situ hybridization experiments were also performed with egpg <dig> and egpg <dig>  the former of which is shown by qpcr analysis to increase to similar amounts in all three tissues, while the later decreases during the ethylene treatments . for egpg <dig>  the results showed an even distribution of transcript present in the three tissues after ethylene treatment, while egpg <dig> was not detected . together, these results corroborate the correlation between the spatial and temporal expression profile of the egpg <dig> transcript in relation to ethylene and cell separation observed by qpcr, and provides further evidence for an important function for this transcript during fruit abscission.

phylogenetic analysis of egpg <dig> in relation to pgs with known functions or expression profiles
to examine the relationship of egpg <dig> with other plant pgs, a phylogenetic comparison of its amino acid sequence with those predicted from dna/rna sequences from arabidopsis and rice was performed. firstly, egpg <dig> groups within the pg clade a <dig> formed with members from both rice and arabidopsis previously defined  <cit>  . notably, egpg <dig> does not group with the pgs from arabidopsis in clade a <dig> shown to function during floral organ abscission, silique or anther dehiscence including at2g <dig> , at3g <dig> , and at3g <dig>   <cit> . however, egpg <dig> is grouped in the a <dig> clade with two other arabidopsis pgs  that are expressed during floral organ abscission  <cit> .

to examine possible structure-function relationships of the egpg <dig> amino acid sequence with those of known pgs from a variety of species, including those producing fleshy fruits , and dry fruits , a phylogenetic analysis was performed with selected plant pgs with expression associated with or shown to function during germination, root or pollen development, fruit ripening, organ abscission, and anther and pod dehiscence  <cit> . firstly, the reconstructed tree and bootstrap values confirm earlier analyses that pgs can be separated into three major subclades, two that consist of pgs involved in fruit ripening and abscission and one with pgs involved in pollen development  <cit>  . the presence of a fourth clade containing soybean  and grape  pgs supports more recent studies that indicate this gene family consists of more than three subclades  <cit> . in addition, the bootstrap analysis confirms a close phylogenetic relationship between egpg <dig> and two arabidopsis pgs expressed during floral organ abscission  <cit> . notably, in the same subclade there are also four abscission related tomato pgs   <cit>  in addition to two pgs expressed during ripening and abscission of melon   <cit> , and pgs expressed during ripening of papaya   <cit> , pear   <cit>  and peach   <cit> . an additional arabidopsis pg  that functions in cell separation between endosperm cells when the radicle emerges during germination  <cit>  was also found within this subclade. the analysis also revealed that the arabidopsis pgs involved in abscission or dehiscence including pgdzat, pgazat, and qtr <dig>  are grouped within a distinct subclade with other pgs that function during fruit ripening, floral organ abscission and pod dehiscence  <cit> . notably, no pg involved in abscission of a fleshy fruit is found in this clade, only those from species with dry fruit such as arabidopsis, b. napus and soybean.

discussion
sequence and expression analysis of egpg <dig> suggests functional conservation and divergences between monocots and eudicots
pgs are thought to play a central role in the disassembly of pectin in the middle lamella or primary cell wall during cell separation and cell elongation  <cit> . in particular, pgs have been extensively studied during fruit ripening, organ abscission and pollen development, yet how divergence has occurred between species in order to fulfil different roles in these various tissues is still not completely understood. in particular, very little data is available from monocot species to compare the ripening and abscission processes with those of eudicots.

our phylogenetic and bootstrap analyses confirmed several previous phylogenetic studies that revealed pgs involved in organ abscission and fruit ripening to be found mainly in two distinct subclades, with a third subclade containing only pollen related pgs  <cit> . a fourth minor subclade that contained a pg from ripening grape skin was also observed as previously  <cit> . while the current phylogenetic analysis was done with the complete gh <dig> domain, not including the prosequences characteristic of some pgs, the results support a previous conclusion that the presence or lack of prosequences are not the basis for the divergence of these sequences into distinct clades  <cit> . the first notable observation is that all the known tomato abscission pgs group closely within a subclade that also contains the two closely related arabidopsis floral organ abscission associated pgs , in addition to an arabidopsis pg  implicated in radicle emergence  <cit> . the presence of at2g <dig>  a pg expressed during the separation of endosperm cells when the radicle emerges during germination, suggests structural relationships between pgs with functions beyond fruit ripening and organ abscission. it is interesting that egpg <dig> groups closest with these arabidopsis abscission pgs, which suggests functional conservation, and that these sequences are derived from a common ancestral pg that existed prior to the separation of monocots and eudicots. a second notable observation is that the tomato fruit pg  is more closely associated with the abscission and dry fruit dehiscence pgs than with the tomato pgs involved in organ abscission. this contrasts with sequences from melon that are in the same subclade as the tomato abscission pgs, and have expression profiles associated with both fruit ripening and abscission  <cit> . similarly, the egpg <dig> transcript does not only increase in the az in relation to abscission, but also is highly expressed in the portion of the ripening mesocarp. together, it appears that some pgs may function both in ripening fruit tissues, in addition to during cell separation in the az that leads to fruit organ abscission in monocots and eudicots.

the sequence and expression of egpg <dig> suggest functional divergence between dry and fleshy fruit
another notable observation is that pgs related to fleshy fruit abscission are not found within the clade containing the well-characterized abscission and/or dehiscent related pgs including qrt <dig>  pgazat, pgdzat, bnrdpg <dig> and pgazbran  <cit> . by contrast, pgs involved in fleshy fruit ripening, such as the tomato , grape , apple , kiwi  and pear  are also found within this clade  <cit> . in addition, only the melon pg  that has an expression profile related to ripening is found in the same subclade as the dry fruit dehiscence and abscission pgs, while the other two melon pgs  associated with organ abscission and ripening are in the same subclade as egpg <dig>  <cit> . while there is no current data that suggests that the fleshy fruit pgs within this subclade are involved in fruit or other organ abscission, it is possible their involvement in cell separation during organ abscission has not been sufficiently investigated. indeed, the analysis and results discussed here are based on the two best-characterized organ abscission model systems available, namely tomato and arabidopsis, and it should be emphasised that many gaps exist in our current knowledge about the functional diversity of plant pgs. nevertheless, the results suggest that dry fruit species may have pgs from at least two divergent subclades involved in cell separation for dehiscence, while fleshy fruit may have pgs specialized in ripening or abscission, or, that may function in both contexts. overall, the results suggest that divergence may have occurred between pgs involved in dry fruit dehiscence and fleshy fruit abscission, an area that merits further investigation.

the high expression and induction of egpg <dig> by ethylene suggests functions during both fruit ripening and abscission
the most notable result of this study is the high accumulation of the egpg <dig> transcript in the base of the fruit containing the az prior to cell separation. importantly, egpg <dig> transcript accumulates prior to the occurrence of cell separation, and also accumulates less and in correlation to the timing of the slower separation in fruit at earlier stages of development. however, the egpg <dig> transcript is also highly expressed in the mesocarp tissue near the apex of the fruit that suggests a role in the ripening of this tissue. our data also indicate that the regulation of egpg <dig> is closely associated with the capacity for cells to respond to ethylene. this in turn is related to the developmental stage of ripening, and may be an important factor that controls the spatial and temporal functionality of egpg <dig> during mesocarp ripening and cell separation in the az. indeed, the mesocarp produces an increasing amount of ethylene during ripening, and production progresses from the apex of the fruit to the fruit base, where it may act as the signal to initiate the separation events within the az  <cit> . studies on fruit ripening and floral pedicel abscission of tomato provide examples of how individual members of this gene family may have distinct functions in adjacent tissues undergoing cell separation processes in a fleshy fruit species, and highlight the central importance of tissue specific transcriptional regulation of pgs during these developmental processes. indeed, the tomato fruit tfpg is the only pg gene expressed in the ripening fruit tissues, its transcription is positively regulated by ethylene, and the encoded protein is responsible for the pg activity required for pectin depolymerisation that occurs during ripening  <cit> . notably, the tfpg mrna accounts for up to  <dig> % of the total rna in ripening tomato fruit, and down regulation of tfpg has no effect on the timing or rate of leaf abscission, indicating a specific function of this enzyme during fruit ripening but not organ abscission  <cit> . in contrast, in the pedicel where the az is located at the base of the tomato floral organs, there are at least four abscission-related pg genes  expressed, three of which are induced by ethylene and correlate well with the cell separation that occurs in the flower and leaf azs  <cit> . furthermore, silencing of the tomato abscission-related pgs using a tapg <dig> fragment, delayed abscission and increased break strength of the leaf petiole azs in explants treated with ethylene. these studies suggest that a combination of tissue specific transcriptional regulation and/or localized cellular differences in response to ethylene are important factors that determine the spatial and temporal specificities related to their functional roles during fruit ripening and organ abscission.

oil palm fruit shedding has some similarities but also notable differences from that seen in tomato. firstly, the timing of separation induced by ethylene in oil palm is comparable to that in tomato. in the presence of ethylene, cell separation begins to occur by  <dig> h, while 80–100% of ripe fruit are shed by  <dig> h, whereas in tomato, flower shedding begins at  <dig> h and is complete by  <dig> h  <cit> . this result is striking given the surface area of the primary az of ripe oil palm, up to  <dig> mm  is approximately  <dig> times larger than the tomato pedicel az, up to  <dig>  mm  <cit> . secondly, we observe a greater diversity of pgs expressed in the oil palm fruit tissues than that of tomato during ripening or abscission. notably, of the  <dig> transcripts expressed in the base of the fruit containing the az, five are regulated positively, and four others negatively in response to ethylene. in addition, five pg mrnas displayed no significant change in abundance during the ethylene treatments. a previous study with banana fruit revealed that at least four pg genes are expressed during ripening  <cit> . however, none of the pgs identified in that study contained the full-length gh <dig> domain and thus we were not able to compare their phylogenetic relationship with the oil palm pgs and other pgs presented in figure  <dig>  the expression of the banana pg genes was also analyzed during finger drop, a process that also involves pectin disassembly  <cit> . the results indicated that the four banana pgs were also expressed in the finger drop zone where cell separation takes place, while mapg <dig> was the most highly expressed with a profile of accumulation correlated to the decrease in the pedicel rupture force observed. together with the present results, the mechanisms of pectin disassembly during banana and oil palm fruit ripening may involve a larger number of pgs than with eudicot species examined thus far. the current study allows a more complete view of pg expression in relation to ethylene in a monocot fruit, given that the earlier studies with banana included fewer and shorter pg sequences  <cit> . in addition, whereas both are monocots, the banana is a parthenocarpic berry-type fruit that accumulates large amounts of starch, while the oil palm is a drupe with the high oil content, which may also dictate different ripening regulatory mechanisms between these two species. future work will require new molecular resources for more complete comparative studies of fruit ripening and abscission in these two diverse monocots, in addition to the well-characterized eudicot tomato model.

in comparison to tomato, the diversity and complexity of pg expression in the oil palm fruit tissues is far greater than that observed in the azs or during ripening. in the oil palm, all  <dig> egpg transcripts are detected to some extent in the ripening mesocarp tissue, in contrast to the single tfpg expressed during tomato fruit ripening. notably, none of the egpgs mrnas identified appears to be completely tissue specific, as observed with the tomato pgs involved in abscission and ripening. however, the data presented here suggest that differences in their tissue and developmental stage dependent response to ethylene may be important for spatial and temporal control. the most notable example is that of egpg <dig>  which is not only the most abundant pg transcript in the mesocarp of untreated ripe fruit, but also undergoes the most dramatic increase in abundance in the base of the fruit containing the az in response to ethylene. the high abundance of egpg <dig> in the mesocarp and the massive increase in response to ethylene is similar to pg expression in tomato; however, egpg <dig> is highly expressed in both the ripening mesocarp and the az after ethylene treatment prior to fruit shedding. furthermore, our in situ hybridization experiments indicate the increase in egpg <dig> transcript abundance in the base of the fruit occurs preferentially in the az compared with the adjacent mesocarp and pedicel tissues. importantly, a delayed and less significant increase in egpg <dig> transcript is also observed in the az of untreated fruit, as well as in  <dig> and  <dig> dap fruit treated with ethylene, which corresponds to the delay in shedding observed at these stages of ripening.

CONCLUSIONS
together, these results provide evidence that egpg <dig> participates in cell wall pectin modifications during both mesocarp ripening and in the az cells during fruit shedding, in close relation to a developmentally regulated cell sensitivity or competence to respond to ethylene. future work will be aimed at identifying the regulatory factors that control the ripening and abscission related expression of egpg <dig>  to provide a basis to compare these processes not only between monocots and eudicots, but in particular between fleshy and dry fruit species. finally, the identification of genes involved in oil palm fruit shedding will also be helpful for oil palm improvement selection strategies.
