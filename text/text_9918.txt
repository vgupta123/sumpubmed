BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of foodborne disease with poultry as a common vector. during the transmission route to the human host, c. jejuni may experience many types of stresses such as exposure to oxygen in the environment, large temperature shifts, and changes in ph. compared with many other foodborne pathogens, c. jejuni is more sensitive towards stress such as acid
 <cit>  and has stringent requirements for optimal growth conditions
 <cit> .

during colonization of the human host, c. jejuni is exposed to low ph environments. at first, the bacteria are exposed to inorganic acid  in the gastric fluid of the stomach and later to organic acids in the small intestine
 <cit> . the capacity to counteract environmental stresses is fundamental for survival. bacteria respond to decreases in ph by inducing different systems to maintain ph homeostasis. these systems may prevent entry of h+, extrusion of h+ from the cell, consumption of h+ in chemical reactions or the repair of damaged cellular material. in some bacteria, such as salmonella and listeria, exposure to acid can up-regulate the f0f1-atpase
 <cit>  by hydrolysis of atp pump h+ out of the cell
 <cit> . amino acid decarboxylation acid resistance systems are found in many bacteria
 <cit> , however, these systems have not been identified in c. jejuni <cit> .

compared to other bacteria, c. jejuni is more sensitive to stress and has a limited number of stress regulators. c. jejuni lacks the global stationary-phase regulator, sigma factor rpos, which induces expression of numerous proteins involved in different forms of stress responses
 <cit>  and it is also involved in acid stress in e. coli and salmonella <cit> . in addition, c. jejuni also lacks the oxidative stress response regulatory elements soxrs and oxyr, and osmotic shock protectants such as betab
 <cit> . however, c. jejuni does contain the global ferric uptake regulator  that regulates genes in response to iron transport, metabolism, and oxidative stress defence
 <cit>  and is involved in acid stress in salmonella and helicobacter pylori <cit> . compared with many other foodborne pathogens, c. jejuni is more sensitive to acid exposure
 <cit> . this sensitivity is probably not only due to the lack of an acid resistance system but also to the lack of the mentioned regulatory proteins. how then does c. jejuni respond on the proteomic level when exposed to low ph?

recently, a transcriptomic analysis of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> found changes in the expression of hundreds of genes upon acid shock or in a simulated gastric environment. primarily, genes involved in encoding ribosomal proteins, transcription and translation, and amino acid biosynthesis were down-regulated
 <cit> . many of the genes up-regulated by acid stress in that study have previously been characterized as heat shock and oxidative stress genes
 <cit> . however, microarray data are complex and all the up-regulated genes do not necessarily translate into changes in specific proteins vital for survival
 <cit> .

here, we want to analyze the acid stress response of c. jejuni strains with different acid sensitivity. since weak and strong acids have different modes of action on the bacterial cell
 <cit> , the acid induced response to both a weak acid, acetic acid, which can be encountered in foods) and a strong acid  was analyzed and compared.

proteins synthesized during stress were labelled by incorporation of radioactive methionine and separated by two-dimensional  electrophoresis. at first, a chemically defined broth  suitable for growth of different c. jejuni strains therefore had to be developed with minimal concentrations of methionine in order to minimize competition with radioactive methionine added upon stress exposure.

methods
bacterial strains and preparation of inocula
three sequenced c. jejuni strains were tested for acid stress response: the clinical human isolate c. jejuni nctc  <dig> from the national collection of type cultures, strain  <dig>  and strain  <dig> . strains  <dig> and  <dig> were originally isolated from turkey production by prof. thomas alter, freie universität, berlin. previous results  have found that strain  <dig> was less sensitive towards tartaric acid, and strain  <dig> was more sensitive to tartaric acid than the nctc  <dig>  respectively. strain  <dig> was denoted as acid-tolerant and strain  <dig> as acid-sensitive. during propagation and growth, all plates were incubated at 42°c in sealed gas jars under micro-aerobic conditions . stocks of all strains were stored at −80°c in broth   containing 15% glycerol. from −80°c stocks, cultures were transferred to blood agar base no.  <dig>  supplemented with 5% horse blood and incubated for 3– <dig> days. one loop full of each culture was subsequently streaked onto new blood agar base no.  <dig> plates. after  <dig> hours of growth, cells were harvested with  <dig> ml phosphate-buffered saline  . the harvested cells were adjusted to od <dig> =  <dig>  which has previously shown to correspond to approx.  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml and subsequently used as inoculum.

preparation of chemically defined broth
a chemically defined medium, originally developed for n. gonorrhoeae <cit> , was modified in order to have an optimal broth to support growth of campylobacter on plates. from the original medium, glucose was removed because campylobacter is unable to ferment or oxidize hexose carbohydrates
 <cit> , and different amino acids were added. the required amino acids were determined from the amino acid metabolic pathway maps listed for c. jejuni nctc  <dig> in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
 <cit>  pathway database. if metabolic enzymes were lacking or if the amino acid biosynthetic pathway was complex, the specific amino acid was added to the modified chemically defined broth .

modified cdb was prepared in double-strength stock batches  without methionine and cysteine, which were added later. the double-strength cdb was stored at −20°c. prior to the experiments, double-strength cdb was thawed at 4°c and diluted to single strength with milliq water . methionine and freshly prepared cysteine were added and the ph was adjusted to  <dig> . finally, the cdb was sterilized by filtration .

the broth was prepared as described in the text.

*: to make portions of  <dig> ml 2 × cdb without methionine and cysteine, only  <dig>  ml of milliq water was added. the batches were sterilized by filtration, aliquoted, and stored at −20°c.

†: cysteine was prepared freshly and dissolved in  <dig> m hcl prior to each experiment.

individual stock solutions were prepared before the mixing of cdb. 10x buffer solution and 20x salt solution were made, autoclaved for  <dig> min at 121°c, and stored at room temperature. the amino acid mix  <dig>  was made in concentrations as listed in table 
 <dig>  however, methionine was prepared as an individual amino acid stock solution so the chemically defined broth could be prepared with different methionine concentrations. the amino acid mix, vitamin mix and the individual components were sterilized by filtration and stored at −20°c until use. stock solutions of cysteine were prepared just prior to use.

growth in chemically defined broth
in the growth experiment, c. jejuni strains nctc  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were tested for growth in cdb containing various concentrations of methionine  and compared with growth in bhi  . from each inoculum,  <dig>  μl was transferred to  <dig> ml pre-heated cdb  resulting in  <dig>   log <dig> cfu/ml. growth of another  <dig> strains was compared in bhi and cdb with  <dig>  mm .

microbiological analyses and sampling
c. jejuni cultures were serially 10-fold diluted in maximum recovery diluent   and 3 ×  <dig> μl of appropriate dilutions were spotted onto blood agar base no.  <dig>  supplemented with 5% horse blood. after 24– <dig> h of incubation under microaerobic conditions, colonies were counted and the numbers of colony-forming units  per ml were determined.

in vitro acid stress and -methionine labelling and protein extraction
the response of c. jejuni to a strong acid  and a weak acid  was tested. these two different acids were selected because campylobacter encounters hcl in the stomach and may be exposed to acetic acid during food processing. the cell cultures were adjusted to ph =  <dig>  for hcl and ph =  <dig>  for acetic acid since these values reduced growth rate to the same level for the most acid-tolerant strain  <dig> . three independent biological replicates were performed for each strain under two different acid stress conditions.

from the inoculum,  <dig> μl were transferred to  <dig> ml pre-heated cdb  containing  <dig>  mm methionine resulting in approximately  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml. c. jejuni strains nctc  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were grown to late exponential phase at 37°c to ensure high metabolic activity and overcome problems due to very low protein outcome in earlier phases . after  <dig> hours of growth for strains  <dig> and nctc  <dig> and  <dig> hours for strain  <dig>  the number of cells corresponded to approximately  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml. then  <dig> ml of the cell cultures  were adjusted to ph  <dig>  with hcl and ph  <dig>  with acetic acid. immediately after 2 ×  <dig> ml cells were transferred to two tubes with screw cap, incubated for  <dig> min and labelled with  <dig> μci/ml l- <dig> s]-methionine  for an additional  <dig> min at 37°c. the  <dig> minutes exposure was chosen to reduce the effect of acid shock
 <cit> .

after acid exposure, the cells were decanted by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g  for  <dig> min. for extraction of proteins, extraction buffer , and  <dig> mg glass beads  were added for cell lysis in a fastprep at speed  <dig> for  <dig> seconds. the suspension was centrifuged at 4°c at  <dig>  × g  for  <dig> min and exactly 2 ×  <dig> μl of protein sample was transferred to a clean eppendorf tube and prepared for 2d gel electrophoresis.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
the protein sample was analyzed by using the ge-healthcare multiphor ii electrophoresis systems using immobiline drystrips for the first dimension and the bio-rad criterion cell system for the second dimension. for rehydration,  <dig> μl protein sample was mixed with  <dig> μl rehydration solution  and applied to an 11-cm immobiline drystrip ph 4– <dig>  and the electrofocusing was run for a total of  <dig>  hours . before protein separation by their molecular weight, the immobiline drystrips were equilibrated, first in  <dig> ml equilibration buffer  containing  <dig>  w/v% dithiothreitol   for  <dig> min and then in  <dig> ml equilibration buffer also containing  <dig>  w/v% iodoacetamide  and a few grains of bromphenol blue  for  <dig> min. in the 2nd dimension, the criteriontm precast 10%–20% tris–hcl gel  gel was used for separation of proteins by size. after draining, the strips were sealed and connected to the gel by using  <dig> % agarose and run in laemmli running buffer . the gels were stained using a silver staining kit , coated with cellophane, dried overnight at room temperature, and exposed to phosphorus screens for  <dig> h.

image and data analysis
radioactive proteins were visualized using a phosphorimager , and the protein spots were analyzed using the image mastertm 2d platinum . initially, protein spots of one set of gels were matched and specific proteins that had higher intensity values than proteins from the control gel were annotated. one set of gels included hcl and acetic acids stressed cells plus a control as a reference. for comparative protein analysis, corresponding protein spots for each specific protein on the control, hcl, and acetic acid gels were manually defined as one group and the match was automatically verified before estimating the volume intensity. the three replicates were compared by normalizing the estimated volume intensity for the individual proteins to percent volume intensity for each replicate. the percent volume intensity was calculated for the specific conditions  as follows:% volume intensity control condition  = volume intensity condition/.

in-gel digestion of protein spots
to examine relevant protein spots, c. jejuni cells were exposed to acid stress without labelling them with methionine but the proteins were separated using the same procedure as for labelling. after the 2nd dimension, and fixation in equilibration buffer  for  <dig> min, the gel was stained with  <dig> ml  <dig>  g/l coomassie brillant blue  <dig> g . relevant protein spots were excised from the gel. the gel pieces were then washed and digested with trypsin as described by sørensen et al. 
 <cit> .

desalting, concentration, and loading on maldi target
gel-loader tips  packed with poros reverse phase  <dig> r <dig>  was used as chromatographic columns for desalting and up-concentration of the digested protein sample prior to spectrometric analysis. the peptide digest was treated and loaded on maldi target as described by sørensen et al. 
 <cit> .

identification of proteins by maldi-tof ms
a maldi-tof-tof instrument  was used to identify proteins. the ms/ms spectra were analysed using data explore v <dig>  . mascot ms/ms ions search  was used to search for matching protein sequences within the ncbi database . the taxonomy was restricted to c. jejuni. the mass tolerance was limited to  <dig> ppm for peptide mass fingerprinting and to  <dig>  da for peptide sequence data.

primer design and quantitative real time pcr  validation of proteome data
to examine if there is any correlation between induced proteins during acid stress with changes in mrna level, a qrt-pcr study on c. jejuni strain nctc  <dig> was performed. besides the induced proteins, the expression of the ferric uptake regulator  was also included since it has been shown that fur regulates genes involved in iron transport, metabolisms and oxidative stress defence
 <cit> . the following were selected as internal and reference genes: lpxc 
 <cit>  and rpoa  . the primer express software version  <dig>   was used to design primers. pcr primers  were purchased from tag copenhagen .

after acid stress exposure ,  <dig> ml culture was mixed with  <dig> ml rna-protect  to stabilize rna and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. the mixture was centrifuged. for enzymatic lysis of the cells, the pellet was dissolved in  <dig> μl te buffer  containing  <dig> mg/ml lysozyme, and added to  <dig> μl proteinase k  and incubated for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. for rna purification and isolation, the rneasy mini kit  was used and the included procedure was followed. to eliminate genomic dna from the isolated rna, the rnase-free dnase set was used . first, the samples were measured out to  <dig>  μg rna thereafter cdna was synthesized using the taqman reverse transcription reagens . each sample was prepared in triplicate resulting in a volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> μl cdna,  <dig> μl  <dig> × power sybr green pcr mix  and final concentration of  <dig>  pmol/μl of forward and reverse primer.

for amplification of pcr products and quantification of produced cdna sybr green, the  <dig> fast real-time pcr system  was used. the thermocycling conditions were 55°c for  <dig> min , 95°c for  <dig> min  followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c min for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min.

to determine the changes in the relative gene transcription level presented as fold changes, a mathematical model for relative quantification of in rt-pcr was used
 <cit> . the expression level of the specific target during acid stress was compared with the expression level of non-stressed cells . three individual biological experiments were performed and data presented as an average.

statistical analysis
all data from the growth experiments, comprising three replicates, were log transformed and statistically analyzed by sas statistical software version  <dig>  . to test for statistically significant differences in growth with various concentrations of methionine in cdb and bhi, a proc glm procedure was used. volume intensity% differences between the individual proteins were calculated by variance analysis  in microsoft excel .

RESULTS
growth in modified chemically defined broth
a modified defined broth that supports the growth of all three c. jejuni strains at the same level as in a rich medium  was developed . ingredients used in the modified cdb for c. jejuni strains are shown in table 
 <dig> 

the change of protein synthesis during acid exposure was determined by adding radioactively labelled methionine to the modified cdb during the stress period. in order to minimize the competition between the methionine and the radioactive methionine in the modified cdb, the minimal concentration of methionine in the modified cdb was determined for the three strains. strain  <dig> had a special requirement for methionine which was illustrated by the fact that in its absence, the bacteria started to die already after  <dig> h. this strain does not possess all the enzymes involved in synthesis of cellular methionine . the modified cdb with  <dig>  mm methionine was used in 2d gel analysis because no significant difference in growth was observed between this concentration and the highest concentration  investigated  . the cdb with methionine supported good growth of all  <dig> strains tested. for nine of the strains the growth and generation times were comparable with bhi, while four of the strains showed either significantly faster or slower growth . it has been shown that auxotyping markers, except cystine and cysteine, are stable after three cycles of freezing and thawing
 <cit> , and it is therefore possible to minimize the workload by preparing batches of double strength stocks and storing these at −20°c.

-methionine labelling during acid stress
c. jejuni strains nctc  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were grown in cdb containing  <dig>  mm methionine at 37°c in a microaerophilic atmosphere. similar numbers of cells in late exponential phase were desirable for comparability between the strains. to achieve cells in the late exponential phase with approximately 1 ×  <dig> cfu/ml, strains of nctc  <dig> and  <dig> were grown for  <dig> hours, whereas strain  <dig> only required  <dig> hours.

the c. jejuni cells were exposed to relatively mild acid conditions  to prevent the cells from dying and closing down all metabolic activity. the gastric ph during a meal has been measured to be  <dig> - <dig> 
 <cit>  and the experimental ph is therefore within the upper range. the effects of acid exposure on cfu for all strains are illustrated in figure 
 <dig>  strain  <dig> was the most acid-tolerant strain while strain  <dig> was the most acid-sensitive at 37°c. this correlated well with earlier findings showing that strain  <dig> was more tolerant than strain  <dig> towards tartaric acid at 4°c
 <cit> . growth of c. jejuni  <dig> was only slightly reduced during hcl and acetic acid stress , whereas the number of cells for strain  <dig> decreased .

proteomic analysis and identification of proteins
methionine labelled protein extracts from non-stressed, hcl or acetic acid-exposed cells were subjected to 2d-gel-electrophoresis analysis. the majority of proteins were repressed as expected. relatively few  induced proteins were identified with only five being significantly induced. the intensity  was calculated for induced proteins under the following conditions: control, hcl, and acetic acid . for strain nctc  <dig>  four proteins  were significantly induced . volume% of bacterioferritin  during hcl stress was higher compared with the control, but probably due to the variation of the control this difference was not significant . for the acid-robust strain  <dig>  dps, p <dig>  moga and trxb were significantly induced . fewer proteins were induced in the acid-sensitive strain  <dig>  which was also reduced during the acid stress . only induction of cj <dig> and moga was observed during hcl acid stress . in the case of nctc  <dig> and  <dig>  the two proteins alkyl hydroperoxide reductase  and superoxide dismutase  had higher% volume intensity than for the control indicating induction; however the differences were not significant. a reference profile of proteins separated by 2d-electrophoresis for c. jejuni  <dig> exposed to hcl stress  is shown in figure 
 <dig>

 <dig> the intensity of the induced proteins was estimated by image mastertm 2d platinum and % volume intensity was calculated.

the intensity of the protein spots was analyzed using the image mastertm 2d platinum . three biological independent replicates was performed and % volume intensity was calculated as: % volume intensity control  = volume intensity /.

quantitative rt-pcr
transcriptomic analysis using qrt-pcr technique was performed to determine if the proteins induced during acid stress were induced at transcription level. figure 
 <dig> illustrates the transcription profiles represented by fold change relative to control of dps, cj <dig>  sodb, trxb, ahpc, moga, p <dig> and fur during hcl and acetic acid stress for strain nctc  <dig>  interestingly, the transcriptomic data did not correspond completely with the proteomic data . the increased gene expression of trxb  and p <dig>  during acid stress corresponded well with enhanced protein production. especially noteworthy is the high acid stress response of p <dig> gene compared with the other genes. proteins such as sodb and ahpc, which were not significantly induced in nctc  <dig>  were, however, over-expressed at transcription level during acetic acid exposure . the regulator fur was included in the qrt-pcr study because a search of putative fur-regulated genes indicated that genes involved in iron-transport genes such as p <dig>  cj <dig>  ceub, cfra, chua, exbb, feob and cfhua and the iron-storage genes such as dps, ferritin  and cj <dig> all contained fur box promoters
 <cit> . fur was not induced in the proteomic study, but there was a tendency, however not significant, that fur was over-expressed during acetic acid stress .

discussion
proteome analysis for campylobacter during acid stress revealed different protein profiles between the strains and the type of acid used. the production of induced proteins during acid stress was measured using radioactive methionine labelling and 2d-gel-electrophoresis in a defined medium after the cultures had been exposed to a strong  and a weak  acid. relatively few proteins  were induced. however, only two were observed in the most acid-sensitive strain . the low number of induced proteins in this strain may be due to a shutdown of the metabolic activity as a result of cell death. in the sequenced strain nctc  <dig>  both hcl and acetic acid exposure caused induction of proteins while in the most robust strain , marked protein induction was primarily seen with hcl. these differences reflect the strain variations in acid sensitivity and probably also the different mode of action of the strong and weak acid on the bacteria cell.

in a comparable proteomic study of the more acid-tolerant bacteria e. coli and salmonella, a  <dig> - <dig> fold induction of  <dig> proteins  and a 2– <dig> fold induction of  <dig> proteins  were found when cells were shifted from ph  <dig> to  <dig> 
 <cit> . the higher number of induced proteins in e. coli and salmonella compared with what we observed may be due to the fact that c. jejuni lack the common acid resistance systems
 <cit>  and the global stress regulator protein rpos, as well as the fact that the c. jejuni genome is small 
 <cit> . of course, small experimental differences and types of acid stress may influence the outcome as well.

the effect of the low ph on the bacterial cell is complex because it is interconnected with other factors such as oxygen stress, growth phase and produced metabolites
 <cit> . most of the proteins observed during acid stress in this study, such as sodb, ahpc, and dps, have been associated with oxidative stress
 <cit> . however, these proteins have also shown to be acid induced in e. coli <cit> , suggesting multiple protective mechanisms. this link has further been supported by a recent campylobacter transcriptomic study where up-regulation of numerous genes including ahpc, sodb and p <dig> during hcl exposure were reported
 <cit> . the central role for dps in acid tolerance response in c. jejuni is supported in a study with a dps e. coli mutant
 <cit>  and in an acid challenge study with salmonella <cit> . in e. coli, dps has multi functional properties such as dna binding, iron sequestration, ferrioxidase activity, and a central role for several stress responses – including acid stress
 <cit> . oxidative stress and free iron are closely connected
 <cit> , and it has been shown that decreasing ph results in enhanced iron-mediated lipid peroxidation processes
 <cit> . via the fenton reaction, free iron can react with h2o <dig> and generate cell-damaging hydroxyl radicals 
 <cit> . regulation of free fe2+ is therefore essential for cellular activities. iron storage proteins indirectly contribute to oxidative stress defence by storing iron in an inactive form thereby preventing formation of harmful hydroxyl radicals. at the same time, it is also important to ensure enough iron for metabolic processes. the acid-induced protein dps has in c. jejuni shown to be involved in superoxide and peroxide defence
 <cit>  and it is likely that the induction of dps is a consequence of the iron released upon acid stress.

the induced  <dig> kda protein  is a well-conserved periplasmic protein in c. jejuni and campylobacter coli species
 <cit>  which previously was found to be fur like  and iron regulated
 <cit> . the p <dig> system is associated with an abc iron transport system 
 <cit>  and up-regulation of the  <dig> kda protein therefore indicates a way to control the intracellular iron level during acid stress.

the thioredoxin system is composed of both trxb and nadph. in e. coli, trxb interacts with unfolded and denatured proteins in a way comparable with molecular chaperones which are involved in proper folding of mis-folded proteins after stress
 <cit> . a similar function of trxb in c. jejuni might be possible as a part of the acid defence mechanisms. trxb might mediate alkyl hydroperoxide reductase  as is the case of h. pylori <cit> .

during the acid stress response, the enzyme moga was induced, which to our knowledge has not been related to acid response before. however, an unpublished microarray study supported our result with acid exposure conditions comparable with our study . after  <dig> minutes up-regulation moga was measured, but only on the limit of the statistical threshold . moga catalyzes the incorporation of molybdenum  into molybdopterin to form molybdenum cofactor , a cofactor in molybdoenzymes
 <cit> . some molybdoenzymes in e. coli contain a modified form of moco. by transferring a gmp  to the terminal phosphate of moco, a molybdenum guanine dinucleotide  is formed. mgd is present in the enzymes formate dehydrogenase  and nitrate reductase  in e. coli <cit> . the periplasmic two-subunit complex, c. jejuni nap, is considered as an electron acceptor
 <cit>  and the enzyme is encoded by napaghbld <cit> . the napa is a ~ <dig> kda catalytic subunit protein that binds the cofactor mgd. basically, during electron transport at low o <dig>  the molybdenum-containing enzyme nitrate reductase reduces no3- to no2- by consuming  <dig> h+. a transcriptional profile of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> after exposure to hcl stress resulted in a transiently or constantly up-regulated napghb and fdha <cit> , indicating that moga most likely is part of an acid stress response.

the weak induction of sodb and ahpc indicate that the enzymatic oxidative stress defence play a role during acid stress. ahpc eliminates oxidative damaging compounds by converting alkyl hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohol
 <cit> , and during this reaction a proton is consumed. sodb eliminates the damaging super oxides 
 <cit> , and in this reaction, protons are also consumed thereby preventing acidification of the cytoplasm. the elimination of o2- and h+ by sodb generates h2o <dig>  another stress factor. if free fe2+ is present in the cell, the produced h2o <dig> can form hydroxyl radicals , which may directly damage dna. this may explain the induced production of dps that reversibly binds iron. the produced h2o <dig> can be removed by catalase  which converts h2o <dig> to h2o and o <dig> <cit> . in contrast to a transcriptional study where an up-regulation of kata gene was noticed after acid exposure
 <cit> , induction of kata was not observed in this proteomic study. since c. jejuni is sensitive towards oxygen and lacks numerous oxidative stress regulators such as soxrs and oxyr
 <cit> , the cell might be in a constantly oxygen-alert state in order to remove reactive oxygen species and damaging components from acid stress.

no induction of heat shock proteins  as chaperones or proteases were observed during acid stress in this study. a transcriptional study found an up-regulation of clpb, dnak, grpe, groel/es and htra <cit> . one explanation could be the sensitivity of 2d-gel-electrophoresis for proteomic analysis as mentioned above and the detection limit due to molecular size and isoelectric point  of the proteins. the hsps, clpp and groes have molecular masses close to the maximum and minimum detection size, respectively, and htra has a pi of  <dig>  which is outside the pi range of the system used here.

acid exposure of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> was related to changes in gene expression and synthesis of acid stress proteins. however, comparison of the proteomic and transcription study showed a limited correlation between induced proteins and over-expression of genes. a recent proteomic study with acid adaptation of salmonella enterica also
 <cit>  found a limited correlation between the outcomes of the transcriptional  versus translational  studies. the lack of corresponding results may be due to the lifetime of the rna and the time from transcription to translation.

CONCLUSIONS
it can be concluded that the three c. jejuni strains, at the phenotypic and proteomic level, responded differently to the acid stresses. we demonstrated that acid stress induces production of several proteins normally involved in iron control and oxidative stress defence in c. jejuni. this work has contributed to the understanding of what occurs in the c. jejuni cells during acid stress.
