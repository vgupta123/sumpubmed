BACKGROUND
with few exceptions  <cit> , ribonuclease p  is one of two universal ribozymes  that are present in all living organisms. this ribonucleoprotein is generally composed of an rna subunit, the rnase p rna , and one or more protein subunits, the rnase p proteins   <cit> . rnase p functions as a phosphodiesterase carrying out the 5' endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer rna  precursor transcripts  to form mature functional trnas  <cit> . regions of the rpr that contribute to the recognition of the substrate cleavage sites  are well studied. remarkably, the catalytic function can be conducted by the rna subunit independently of protein subunits, indicating that the biological activity resides in the rpr  <cit> .

the ubiquitous distribution of rpr molecules in life suggests that a primordial rpr form was already present before the diversification of the three superkingdoms of life, archaea, bacteria, and eukarya  <cit> . furthermore, the rpr is also the catalytic subunit in all three superkingdoms  <cit> . bacterial rprs have been divided into two independently folding domains, the catalytic  domain involved in substrate cleavage and the specificity  domain involved in substrate binding  <cit> . the s domain is composed of stem p <dig> and stems distal to p <dig> while the rest of the molecule delimits the c domain. the c domain contains the entire active site and binds the acceptor stem/5'-leader and the acca sequence at the 3' end  of pre-trna, cleaving the leader sequence in the presence of bacterial rpp cofactors  <cit> . the s domain binds the tΨc stem-loop region of pre-trna and confers substrate specificity. rpr can be divided into five universally distinct conserved regions  that are distal to each other in the primary sequence and define the universally conserved core structure  <cit> . the s domain comprises cr ii and iii and the c domain comprises cr i, iv, and v  <cit> . while components of the tertiary fold are overwhelmingly helical it is interesting that both domains have many nonhelical parts: cr ii and iii form two interleaving t-loop motifs whereas cr i, iv, and v are part of loops and turns.

altman and kirsebom  <cit>  proposed that an earlier rpr form that lacked the s domain might have existed in the rna world, because this domain was not needed for the binding of the substrate. the c domain was therefore more ancient than the s domain. remarkably, modification of the s domain of bacillus subtilis indicates substrate specificity can be altered without changing the basic cleavage reaction  <cit> . in fact, a "minimal" rpr, the smallest molecule needed to carry out the hydrolysis reaction, has been defined  <cit> . this minimal rpr contains molecular components from both the s and c domains. interestingly, consensus rnase p structures show that the c domain is more conserved than the more variable s domain in all three superkingdoms  <cit> . however, the c domain by itself is either non-functional in the absence of cognate rpps or has greatly decreased catalytic activity compared to the wild type  <cit> . furthermore, the s domain appears to facilitate substrate recognition and binding in the ribozyme reaction and the s domain alone can bind pre-trna directly  <cit> . all these observations suggest the c domain is indeed ancestral and that the s domain plays an accessory but important role during the cleavage of precursor trna. despite the relevance of these results, the evolutionary history of the molecular components of the two structural folding domains remains elusive.

here we study the evolution of the rnase p complex with a well-established phylogenetic method that reconstructs evolutionary history directly from structure  <cit> . this cladistic approach produces intrinsically rooted trees that "embed structure and function directly into phylogenetic analysis"  <cit> . the method has been applied widely to study the evolution of structure in rrna  <cit> , trna  <cit> , sine rna  <cit> , and other molecules  <cit> , and has also been extended to the evolutionary study of protein domains at fold and fold superfamily  levels of structural complexity  <cit> . two kinds of trees are generated in studies of rna evolution, 'trees of molecules' that describe the evolution of molecular lineages, and 'trees of molecular substructures' that describe the evolution of structural components of the molecules. using this methodology, we here study the history of the structure of the rna subunit, establishing how the shape of the rpr molecule and its structural domains changed in evolution . this information was then coupled with an evolutionary analysis of rpp domain structures at fsf level using previously developed methods of phylogenomic reconstruction  <cit> . finally, the evolutionary tracing of phylogenetic information in crystallographic models  help clarify how the history of the ribonucleoprotein relates to the discovery of function and the establishment of rna-protein interactions.

RESULTS
a cladistic strategy to study the evolution of molecular structure
we illustrate our cladistic approach with a flow diagram that describes how we study rna and proteins . when analyzing rna molecules, we first deconstruct rna secondary structure into substructures, very much as nucleic acid sequences are deconstructed into nucleotide sites for the purpose of phylogenetic analysis. rpr crystal structures show that a substantial portion of the molecule is helical or approximately helical, a feature that rpr shares with rrna and other functional rna. for example, the ribosomal ensemble can be effectively considered an arrangement of ~ <dig> helical segments in three-dimensional  space  <cit> . in these molecules, the accretion of disparate helical segments contributes to the aggrandizement of ribosomal structure, which is ultimately responsible of making up crucial functional centers  <cit> . similarly, the rpr molecule can be considered an arrangement of ~ <dig> helical substructures , some of which are missing in particular molecular lineages . since crystallographic models and comparative sequence analysis support the existence and homology of these substructures, attributes describing structural features of these substructures  can be used as phylogenetic characters to build either trees of molecules or trees of substructures . the attributes of these substructures are therefore analogous to the presence of a nucleotide at a particular site in a nucleic acid sequence in traditional phylogenetic reconstructions, with the caveat that it would be indeed challenging to build trees of sites  directly from sequence.

we illustrate the analysis in more detail with a concrete example of how we build trees of molecules and trees of substructures . we first generate primary rpr sequence alignments that take into consideration the secondary structure of the molecules. we then score the lengths of segments that form base pairs or remain unpaired, traversing from the 5' to the 3' end of the molecules that are examined. in this process we assign substructures to stems, bulges, hairpins, and other unpaired segments as we encounter these in the secondary structure. this defines a data matrix with for example columns describing substructures and rows describing the rpr molecules. these matrices can be partitioned into matrices of substructures types  and encoded in the nexus format , which are then used as input text file for equally weighted unconstrained maximum parsimony  analysis. in the file, the first column represents a phylogenetic character and individual numerical values character states. rows are phylogenetic taxa. the input files generate rooted trees of molecules or trees of substructures depending on what is considered taxa . the nexus file also defines the character states of a hypothetical ancestor  and this determines the preferred direction  of character state change. this hypothetical ancestor in our example has the maximal character state for each character and is included in the search for optimal rooted trees with the sole purpose of polarizing character state transformation. no external hypotheses in the form of outgroups  are needed to root the trees. the external hypotheses are replaced by the more axiomatic polarization assumption of our evolutionary model. for more detailed descriptions of the method and model, see materials and methods and for example  <cit> .

with proteins, we use hidden markov models  of structural recognition to survey protein sequences in genomes, decomposing proteins into protein domains at fsf level . the survey establishes the number of copies of a domain that exist in the proteome of an organism that has been fully sequenced, and these numbers are used as character states when constructing data matrices, with columns and rows representing proteomes or domain architectures. as with rna, matrices can be transposed to construct trees of proteomes or trees of architectures. trees of architectures define the age of each individual domain , and this information can be used to establish the relative and absolute age of the rpps that are present in the rnase p complex.

phylogenetic utility of rpr structure and the early origin of archaea
recent studies have indicated that rpr molecules are suitable for phylogenetic analysis of closely related bacterial taxa and have potential as a tool for species discrimination  <cit> . one distinctive feature is that there is only one copy of the encoding gene in a genome making it more refractory to inter-specific lateral gene transfer. moreover, rprs from archaea, bacteria, and eukarya are easily distinguished from each other, serving as good and reliable molecular markers for systematic phylogeny. sequence diversity expresses even if the structure and associated catalytic function of the molecules remain unchanged  <cit> . this feature becomes extremely useful when exploring deep evolutionary relationships, especially in cases where sequences are too variable or when molecules that are compared are distantly related   <cit> . in this regard, collins et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that phylogenetically informative characters are indeed embedded in the secondary structure of rpr molecules and that these can be used to uncover the tripartite nature of life heralded by the woese school. in the present study, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees describing the evolution of  <dig> rprs using information in sequence and structure . these phylogenies were generally well resolved and clustered molecules belonging to the three superkingdoms, with archaea and eukarya generally appearing unified in single  groups . since structural phylogenetic characters provide a direction to evolutionary change without the need of outgroups or external hypotheses of relationship  <cit> , their inclusion established patterns of origin and was therefore particularly advantageous. figure  <dig> describes a rooted tree generated using the total evidence approach from both structure and sequence data. with the exception of a single bacterial molecule that appeared at the base of the tree and harbored a unique structural type , archaeal rprs were ancient while eukaryal rprs were derived. this rooting of the tree of molecules suggests an early diversification of archaea. the result is particularly remarkable, especially because it is congruently supported by phylogenetic analyses of trna paralogues  <cit> , the structure of trna  <cit>  and 5s rrna  <cit> , and phylogenomic studies of domain structure  <cit>  and domain organization in proteins  <cit> .

 - information on structural characters is given in parentheses. source of eukaryal molecules: nucleus , mitochondia , chloroplast , and cyanelle .

 - trees were derived from data matrices partitioned according to superkingdom, or structural characters of rpr folding domains, and from complete data matrices of sequence, structure, or combined sequence and structure. the number of taxa/characters analyzed is shown in parentheses. symbols "+" and "-" are used to indicate the existence of monophyletic or non-monophyletic groupings of rprs, respectively . ci, consistency index ; ri, retention index; rc, rescaled consistency index; symbol "-" indicates non-applicable data.

detailed phylogenetic patterns were maintained when data were partitioned according to superkingdoms or according to sequence, structure, or structural domain . as previously reported for other rna molecules  <cit> , trees derived from structure were largely congruent with those derived from sequence, both from combined data or matrices partitioned according to superkingdoms, with the incongruent nodes being weakly supported by bootstrap values  and generally basal in the trees. congruence was also observed when comparing trees generated by neighbor-joining  and mp analyses. in terms of superkingdoms, only trees reconstructed from the s domain or from stabilizing structural characters failed to reveal the monophyly of both archaea and eukarya. trees generated from the c domain  were better resolved than those derived from the s domain . similarly, trees derived from de-stabilizing characters were better resolved than those obtained from stabilizing characters. interestingly, trees derived from helical structure conserved in all three superkingdoms were largely unresolved . overall results strongly support the generally accepted concept that ancient substructures that are more stable and are universal have less power to resolve phylogenetic relationships of lineages than derived substructures that are less stable, are lineage specific, or are believed part of derived structural domains.

in archaea, the monophyly of crenarchaeota was recovered by the combined analysis of structure and sequence data  but not by separate analyses of either structure or sequence data alone. the monophyly of euryarchaeota was not revealed in any analysis. this result agrees with whole-genome studies that have questioned the monophyly of these two groups  <cit> . furthermore, the monophyly of euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota is based on 16s rrna, the most popular gene for evolutionary studies. however, it is now becoming apparent that there is only partial agreement between the 16s rrna universal tree and phylogenies derived from proteins or genomic complements  <cit> . in bacteria, major bacterial groups were clearly identified but branching patterns were mostly unresolved. this is an expected result, especially because bacterial phylogeny has not been convincingly reconstructed and the issue of the branching order of major bacterial lineages remains contentious. for example, phylogenetic analyses of a large dataset of all available bacterial rpr sequences resulted in unstable tree topologies  <cit> . observations are therefore consistent with rprs being of limited phylogenetic use in bacteria: relationships among phyla were largely unresolved while relationships within phyla were well-resolved and comparable to relationships within superkingdoms archaea and eukarya.

evolution of rpr types
an accurate model for rpr structure is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of substrate recognition , catalytic activity , and evolution of the ribozyme, and is supported by a significant body of evidence from biochemical, photochemical, molecular, crystallographic, and phylogenetic comparative studies. for example, refined secondary structure models have been inferred by identifying concerted changes  in the nucleotide sequence of rprs that share common ancestry and function and have been generally confirmed by biochemical and crystallographic evidence  <cit> . in these analyses, the eukaryal secondary structure is not sufficiently resolved  <cit> , and although there are no high-resolution structures available for archaeal and eukaryal rprs, the identification of more than  <dig> sequences from each superkingdom allowed considerable refinement of secondary structure models  <cit> . five general types of rpr structures are recognized in molecules belonging to the three superkingdoms . covariation analyses of a comprehensive set of bacterial rpr sequences established a well-defined secondary structure, identified tertiary interactions, and classified rprs into two major classes with distinct secondary structures  <cit> . the common ancestral-type or type a structure, represented by escherichia coli, is found in most bacterial and archaeal organisms. the bacillus-type or type b, represented by bacillus subtilis, is found only in low-gc gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . through a process of convergent molecular evolution, most of the unusual structural elements of type b rprs evolved independently in thermomicrobium, a member of the green non-sulfur bacteria, to form type c rprs   <cit> . in archaea, the methanococcus and archaeoglobus fulgidus rprs form a unique derived structure class, type m, with an apparently less complex structure  in comparison to the ancestral type a structure  <cit> . finally, eukaryal rprs generally lack a convincing secondary structure model and are distinct from those of bacteria and archaea. they are defined as type e.

 - substructures sampled in the present study are ordered by nd values. "+" and "-" indicate the presence or absence of the helical substructures, respectively.

trees of molecules dissected the evolutionary history of the different types of rpr structures and their evolutionary origin . mapping of the various types of rprs on the trees revealed patterns of origin and evolution of structural design . type a molecules in archaea and bacteria were clearly ancestral compared to type b molecules, while type m structures of methanogenic archaeal species appeared quite early in the monophyletic archaeal group. eukaryal type e molecules were the most derived in the tree. it is generally acknowledged that type a is the most ancient folding structure in rprs  <cit>  and that the ancestral type a form underwent substantial innovative change in the common specific ancestry of the eukaryal and archaeal lineages. this change can be visualized in the make-up of the rnase p complex. for example, enzymes in both archaea and eukarya contain more proteins than those in bacteria, suggesting that archaeal and eukaryal rprs have coevolved to display a greater dependence on their cognate proteins. the eukaryal rprs are weaker catalysts than their bacterial counterparts, supporting the notion that rpps play important functional roles, assisting for example in rna folding, substrate binding, and/or catalysis. although archaeal rprs are composed of an rna subunit similar to bacterial rprs  <cit> , the multiple protein subunits are similar to those in the eukaryotic nucleus  <cit> . more importantly, a few bacterial rpr structural elements that are essential for substrate binding, catalysis, and global stability were either never acquired or lost during evolution of the archaeal and eukaryal rprs, accounting for their lower stability/activity in the absence of cognate rpps  <cit> . furthermore, the archaeal and eukaryal rprs are clearly missing sequence/structure elements present in bacterial rprs that are either important for tertiary contacts or for direct interactions with the substrate . for example, the l <dig> loop  that establishes base-pairing interactions with the cca sequence at the 3' end of pre-trnas is also absent in all eukaryal and some archaeal rprs. these observations suggest that archaeal and eukaryal rprs underwent reductive evolutionary tendencies similar to those seen in the very ancient components of proteomic repertoires  <cit> .

interestingly, the type c rpr structure from thermomicrobium roseum was placed at the base of trees of molecules . type c and type b rprs are not phylogenetically related at sequence level and present major structural differences, including the presence of p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> in type c and their replacement with p <dig>  in type b . however, they also share structural features  resulting from convergent molecular evolution events  <cit> .

evolution of rpr structure
phylogenetic trees of rpr substructures  provide a chronology that establishes which parts of the molecule are ancestral and which parts are derived. we generated trees describing the evolution of helical stems, hairpins, bulges, and unpaired regions . since rna structures are defined by a frustrated conformational interplay of stems and loops, the tree of stem substructures  constitutes the fundamental scaffold of structural evolution of the entire molecule. trees of stems derived from the complete dataset and from datasets partitioned according to the c and s structural domains revealed concordant topologies . the analysis of other substructures was less informative but complemented the original evolutionary patterns derived from the stem scaffold . for example, the tree of unpaired regions showed the 5'-terminal free end of the molecule  was more ancient than the 3' end , a pattern that was recovered independently in the analysis of both trna and 5s rrna molecules  <cit> .

 - trees were derived from data matrices partitioned according to structural domains and complete data matrices. ci, consistency index ; ri, retention index; rc, rescaled consistency index.

the most ancient substructure in the tree was p <dig>  a terminal stem of the s domain . this substructure was immediately followed by four helical segments of the c domain, p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  in that order, one of which  represents the universal pseudoknot structure of the complex. substructures p <dig> to p <dig> define an important molecular feature that is revealed on the tree as a paraphyletic basal group. this helix structure contains the rnase p active site  <cit> , the catalytic center that cleaves the pre-trna sequence. furthermore, substructures p <dig> to p <dig> are part of the conserved minimal core defined by siegel et al.  <cit> , which is shared by organisms in all three superkingdoms. the other shared substructure in this core is helix p10- <dig>  another substructural component of the s domain, which appears in the tree immediately after the p1-p <dig> core structure. however, this substructure sustains considerable sequence variation, particularly among eukaryotic rprs. interestingly, the most conserved nucleotides in the rpr sequence are concentrated in the core structure  and in the large loop between p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> .

the taxonomic distribution of evolving stem substructures revealed that, with an exception in the p <dig> stem that was lost in type m archaeal molecules, the first  <dig> most ancient structures were universally present in all rpr molecules . note however that p <dig> is absent in mycoplasma fermentans and thermoproteaceae, species with highly reduced genomes  <cit> . the next structure to evolve was a pseudoknot  that is typical of type a molecules in archaea and bacteria, but not present in eukarya. this stem was followed by a number of structures generally shared by rprs in one or more superkingdoms, with structures specific to bacterial type a rprs evolving first, followed by structures specific to archaeal type a molecules, and then structures specific to bacterial type b rprs . these patterns define the possible emergence of superkingdoms and match the rooted topology of the tree of molecules derived from combined sequence and structure datasets, which suggests the early diversification of archaea .

with the exception of stem p <dig>  the c domain was in general more ancient than the s domain on all of the trees of stem substructures analyzed. the ancestral nature of the c domain was also revealed in trees of other substructures . overall, the highly conserved p1-p <dig> core structure was primordial in the c domain when compared to many other helical structures that were added later in evolution to both structural domains. consequently, our phylogenetic constructs provide an additional and strong line of evidence in support of the ancestral nature of the c domain  <cit> . note that exclusion of stem p <dig> and other basal substructures from the analysis did not alter the topology of the trees, supporting the robustness of our phylogenetic hypotheses .

the catalytic core represents the set of four ancestral elements  in the rpr molecule  and the only four conserved stems of the c domain in the universal consensus minimum structure of rpr  <cit> . it is therefore particularly noteworthy that these ancestral and conserved substructures interact with the ancient top domain of the pre-trna as it cleaves its 5' end sequence . this top half of the pre-trna molecule is composed of the tΨc and acceptor arms. previous phylogenetic studies indicate that the top domain of trna predates evolutionarily the bottom domain composed of the dihydrouridine  and anticodon arms  <cit>  supporting the ancestrality of this part of the molecule  <cit> . consequently, the relative age of molecular contacts suggests the co-evolution of the top domain of trna  and the c domain of the rpr . given the supporting  function carried out by the s domain, the ancestrality of the very ancient p <dig> substructure is clearly of evolutionary significance .

early origins of rna-protein interactions in the catalytic complex
it is critical that we examine rna-protein interactions in the rnase p complex, given that proteins and catalytic rna are both required for enzyme activity in vivo. in addition to pre-trnas, there are a few other substrates for rnase p in vivo, such as pre- <dig> s rna, pre-tmrna, a few mrnas, and riboswitches  <cit> . to date, it is generally realized that rpr-rpp interactions serve to stabilize the structure of the complex, enhancing substrate recognition and affinity for substrates and metal ions  <cit> .

bacterial rnase p studies show that type b and ancestral type a molecules can interchangeably activate rna catalytic functions  <cit>  at both protein and rna levels, indicating that the rpp recognizes a region of structure that is conserved between the two classes of bacterial rnase p enzymes  <cit> . the crystal structures of type a  and type b  rprs  <cit>  revealed similar features in the catalytic cores of both rnas, including the coaxial stacks p1/p4/p <dig>  p2/p <dig>  and p8/p <dig>  specifically, the metal binding loop and n-terminus of the rpp are near the p <dig> stem-loop of the rpr. additionally, the conserved rnr motif is close to helix p <dig>  which is necessary for positioning divalent metal ions required for catalysis, and is the putative active site of the holoenzyme  <cit> . these studies support the notion that the rpp binds a conserved area of the rpr, stabilizing the local rna structure, as well as stabilizing the rpr contacts with the pre-trna substrates  <cit> .

as discussed previously, our results support the hypothesis that the c domain is the ancestral structural and functional domain  <cit> . however, they also show that the catalytic rna-protein complex is ancient . the rpp contacts the catalytic domain of the rpr molecule, with specific contacts involving the p1-p <dig> core structure in a region that has been proposed to contain the active site and the phylogenetically conserved rna core  <cit> . evolutionary heat maps support the ancestrality of these contacts, which are basal on the trees of substructures . the implication of a direct interaction of the rpp with the ancient p1-p <dig> core structure is therefore fundamental, suggesting the early involvement of proteins in catalysis.

it is noteworthy that both archaeal and eukaryal rpps show extensive protein-protein and protein-rna interactions, and that some of these may also involve the s domain. furthermore, only a subset of the protein subunits may be necessary for catalytic activity while other proteins function in assembly and/or localization. in fungi, only two  out of nine nuclear rpps interact with rpr  <cit> . tsai et al.  <cit>  suggested that the rpp21/rpp <dig> and pop5/rpp <dig> pairs in pyrococcus furiosus interact with the s and c domains, respectively, enabling the inter-domain cooperation required for optimal pre-trna recognition and catalysis. enzymatic footprinting also demonstrated that the rpp21/rpp <dig> protein complex in pyrococcus furiosus interacts only with the s domain of the rpr  <cit> . moreover, many studies show that helix p <dig> of the rpr catalytic core, which is ancient in our study, is the binding site for rpps and rnase mrp proteins. crystal structure of the p <dig> in rnase mrp of saccharomyces cerevisiae also suggests some likely functions of p <dig> in stabilizing the enzyme's structure and in interactions with pre-trna  <cit> . in human nuclear rnase p, rpp <dig> binds to h <dig> rna and also to the p <dig> domain  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae rnase mrp and rnase p, pop <dig> and pop <dig> form a heterodimer that binds directly to p <dig>  protecting a segment of the lower strand of the internal loop of p <dig> and part of the adjacent helical stem  <cit> . similar results were obtained for human rnase mrp  <cit> . furthermore, rna-protein interactions involving p <dig> are not limited to the pop6/pop <dig> heterodimer; other proteins probably interact with this extended helix  <cit> . for example, helix p <dig> also appears to interact specifically with pop <dig> in both s. cerevisiae rnase p and rnase mrp  <cit> .

the age and evolution of rpps
the number of proteins associated with catalytic rna varies greatly between archaea, eukarya, and bacteria. in general, there are 4- <dig> and 9- <dig> protein units in archaeal  <cit>  and eukaryal molecules  <cit> , respectively. in contrast, bacterial rnase p enzymes are the simplest versions of the complex. they consist of only one protein and a single rpr molecule, providing a conserved and straightforward molecular ensemble for crystallographic study  <cit> .

in order to study the evolution of rpps and determine the putative age of protein-rna contacts, we timed the appearance of the 3d structure of rpp-associated domains in a tree of architectures derived from phylogenomic analysis of domain structure at fsf level of structural classification . the global phylogeny of protein architectures was reconstructed from a hmm-based genomic census in  <dig> completely sequenced organisms . this tree describes the history of  <dig>  fsfs and was used to determine the relative age of rpp domains of known structure. we also used hmms to assign protein structure to  <dig>  rpp-associated sequences in the uniprotkb database, revealing that  <dig>  of these entries were linked to  <dig> fsfs,  <dig> of which were rpr-associated holoenzymes. interestingly,  <dig> sequence entries were linked to the nad-binding rossmann fold domain , the second most ancient fsf , and corresponded to the recently identified rpps that do not associate with rna cofactors  <cit> . the age of rpr-linked domains ranged from nd =  <dig>  in the ribosomal protein s <dig> domain-like domain  typically found in bacterial complexes to nd =  <dig>  in the alba-like domain .

we previously identified three epochs in the evolution of proteins  <cit>  and rna  <cit> , an ancient 'architectural diversification epoch' in which ancient molecules   <cit>  emerged and diversified, a 'superkingdom specification' epoch in which molecules sorted in emerging archaeal and eukaryal-like organismal lineages, and a late 'organismal diversification' epoch in which molecular lineages diversified in an increasingly diversified tripartite world. four of all rpp domains  originated in the architectural diversification epoch, while two appeared quite late during the organismal diversification epoch  . interestingly, the most ancient rpr-associated protein domain , the ribosomal protein s <dig> domain-like fsf  depicted in the complex of figure 5b and 5c, appeared very early in the protein world, at the start of the architectural diversification epoch. other rpr domains associated with known crystal structures directly through pdb entries or when using hmms of structural recognition, were more derived , some even appearing during the organismal diversification epoch. this suggests rpps interacted with the ancient p1-p <dig> core structure to form a primordial rnase p complex very early in evolution, at a time when the world of organisms was not diversified. since the most ancient domain architectures in this tree had an origin in nucleotide metabolism  <cit> , it is clear that this primordial rnase p complex was derived compared to ancient protein enzymes in primitive metabolic networks.

one interesting observation is the age of the domain linked to rnase p enzymes in organelles of eukarya that do not require rpr cofactors   <cit> . the domain of these protein-only rnase p molecules, the nad-binding rossmann fold domain  is widely distributed in nature  and is very old . this suggests that the addition of the rpr moiety to the catalytic protein-based rnase p enzymes is either a derived feature or alternatively that the domain was co-opted late in evolution in eukaryotic organelles to perform the ribonucleoprotein task. however, the fact that the make-up of rpp domains is varied and evolutionarily diverse in rnase p suggests recruitment plays an important role in evolution of catalysis in this complex and the argument can be used to disfavor the idea that organellar protein enzymes are ancient fossils. without additional evidence capable of dissecting recruitment, however, the age of the c. <dig>  domain cannot be used to support or refute the ancestrality of rpps relative to rprs.

the ancient origin and centrality of stem p12
studies have shown that the s domain contributes to pre-trna recognition and helps position the substrate for optimal cleavage  <cit> . however, while rpps appear to bind solely to the c domain  <cit> , footprinting  <cit>  and crosslinking analyses  <cit>  suggest that the p <dig> substructure is also part of the protein-binding site. however, the possible role of p <dig> has been questioned; further studies have shown that the protein footprinting is restricted to the c domain  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the sequence at the base of helix p <dig> is relatively conserved and is physically adjacent to the core of the enzyme in close proximity to the connection between the top and bottom halves of the pre-trna molecules . however, the overall sequence of p <dig> does not contain any of the universally conserved nucleotides of the molecule  <cit>  and its role as functional determinant is variable, being sometimes dispensable . regardless of it playing an accessory or vital role in the current function of the molecule, the observation that p <dig> is indeed the most ancestral substructure of the complex , despite it being considered part of the structural s domain, lends support to its early role in a putative catalytic activity that is now partially displaced to the more derived p1-p <dig> core structure and also involves crucial protein-rna interactions. this ancient catalytic activity could have been different to that of the extant catalytic rpr core and could have been neofunctionalized later on in evolution as the structure was co-opted to perform new roles. it is interesting to note that p <dig> has been lost in a few lineages, most probably as a secondary evolutionary event. this may suggest that its functional role is limited and sometimes dispensable and that in some cases the substructure does not contribute significantly to organismal fitness. alternatively, the loss of the substructure may have been advantageous, as it could have defined different substrate specificities.

results also underscore the significance of a primordial stem-loop that originally harbored a multitude of primordial functions, most of which were lost or displaced as molecules evolved and gained specific roles. the concept of a hairpin being the starting component of trna  <cit>  has been emphasized by the genomic tag hypothesis  <cit>  and has been recently supported by phylogenetic studies of the structure of sine rna  <cit>  and trna molecules  <cit> . recent analyses of 5s rrna  <cit>  and major rrna subunits  are in line with this evidence. the proposal that the p <dig> substructure of the rna subunit may be a modern derivative of the primitive multifunctional hairpin structure and that this substructure probably lost most primordial functions as the rnase p complex evolved is therefore of great significance and merits careful examination.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals several important evolutionary patterns linked to the structure and function of rna and protein components of rnase p:  the early origin of archaeal rpr molecules, which suggests the lineage leading to superkingdom archaea is ancestral;  the origin of the rpr molecule in the p <dig> substructure, closely followed by the catalytic p1-p <dig> core structure;  the ancient origin of the c domain;  the early appearance of rpp substructures that interact with proteins in this primordial rnase p complex;  and the ancestral nature of rpr-associated proteins, which originated at the onset of the protein world. based on these observations we propose a model for the early evolution of the ribonuclease catalytic complex in a lineage leading to the last universal common ancestor of life . in this model, the interaction of primordial protein and rna molecules result in a complex that is stabilized later in evolution by the establishment of a pseudoknotted structure . this catalytic structure is ultimately responsible for the modern make-up of the molecule, as accessory substructures organize around it and enhance the catalytic activities and specificity of the evolving ribonucleoprotein particles.
