BACKGROUND
the japanese quail  is valued for its uniquely flavored eggs and meat and is reared in many countries of the world, particularly on a large scale in china, japan, brazil, hong-kong, france and spain  <cit> . it is also an important animal model used in a range of scientific disciplines including embryonic development  <cit> , behavior  <cit> , physiology  <cit> , genetics  <cit>  and biomedicine  <cit> . in common with its close relative species the chicken, japanese quail belongs to the the family phasianidae in the order galliformes and the two species have diverged  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . they have a karyotype of 2n =  <dig> chromosomes comprising a few morphologically distinct macrochromosomes  and numerous cytologically indistinguishable microchromosomes. moreover, chromosome homology between both species has been reported to be highly conserved, revealing only very few rearrangements  <cit> . this enables the nomenclature of the quail chromosomes  to follow that of chicken by using corresponding numbers as suggested by the marker and gene data. however, unlike chicken where the majority of avian genomic studies have focused, much remains to be done on quail and other agriculturally and biologically important species. with the completion of the chicken genome map and sequence, a solid foundation has been laid on which comparative maps can be made for the less-studied poultry species. from this viewpoint, quail genome mapping would greatly profit from the unique relation between quail and chicken.

to further enhance the genetic improvement of this species as a food animal and also boost its potential as a research model for poultry, we have initiated mapping efforts in the japanese quail, for which molecular information has been scarce until now. indeed, mapping in quail has progressed from just three classical linkage groups based on plumage color and blood protein markers  <cit>  to the first ever dna-based genetic map constructed solely with aflp markers  <cit>  and to the recent microsatellite-based map  <cit> . however, both dna-based maps were not only developed with different types of markers, but also used distinct populations. therefore, to establish links between them, we genotyped markers from the microsatellite map in the population previously used for the aflp map. also, by adding a third mapping population, new microsatellite markers that were previously uninformative could be added to the integrated map.

finally, to establish stronger links to the chicken maps and assembled sequence, we used three strategies:  gene loci were mapped in one population by developing single nucleotide polymorphism  markers,  microsatellite markers were located on the chicken sequence assembly by blastn searches, and  comparative cytogenetic studies were conducted by means of fish experiments.

RESULTS
three mapping populations were used in the present study. population  <dig>  had previously been used to construct an aflp map of quail and to map qtl for behavior traits  <cit> ; population  <dig>  to derive the first microsatellite map in quail and to map qtl  <cit> ; and finally, population  <dig>  to map plumage color and blood protein loci by microsatellite genotyping  <cit> .

comprehensive microsatellite and gene maps
all the microsatellite markers available and informative were genotyped in pop <dig> and pop <dig>  thus adding  <dig> markers to the previously published map. as the information on quail genes available in the public databases was scarce, to detect snp in quail we opted to choose primers from chicken expressed sequence tags  with the understanding that the two species are closely related and, therefore, have highly conserved genes. all functional gene markers developed from chicken est were tested by pcr for their suitability to amplify quail dna, and the quail amplicon was sequenced in both forward and reverse directions to confirm orthology. detection of polymorphism and genotyping of type i markers were done only on pop <dig> by single strand conformation polymorphism  analysis. therefore, to link together the microsatellite maps derived from pop <dig> and pop <dig> to the aflp and gene-containing map derived from pop <dig>  a set of  <dig> microsatellite markers was chosen from the first microsatellite map  <cit>  for genotyping pop <dig>  the choice of microsatellites was based on their position in the linkage group, so as to cover the entire map with a minimal set of markers to be used as anchor points.

in all,  <dig> markers comprising  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> functional genes were analyzed by two-point linkage analysis including the genotype data from the three populations. the number of informative meioses in the comprehensive f <dig> mapping population of  <dig>  quail varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> per locus and was therefore sufficient to assure high levels of support for ordering the linkage groups. ninety-two of the markers, representing  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> genes, were resolved into  <dig> autosomal linkage groups and a z chromosome-specific linkage group  while the remaining  <dig> markers  showed no linkage to any other marker. the size of the linkage groups ranges from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  and the overall map coverage within linkage groups is  <dig>  cm with an average spacing of  <dig>  cm between loci. thus, the integration of data from the three mapping populations and the inclusion of additional markers has enabled the extension of the microsatellite and gene-containing linkage groups from  <dig> cm  <cit>  to  <dig> cm. most of the functional gene markers were assigned to cja <dig> since they were developed for chromosome  <dig> as part of a study to confirm a putative qtl.

aligning the comprehensive map to the aflp map
after microsatellite genotyping in pop <dig>  two-point linkage analysis between these new markers and the aflp was used to establish the links with the maps derived from pop <dig> and pop <dig>  overall, by using a lod score threshold of  <dig> ,  <dig> out of the  <dig> aflp linkage groups were linked to  <dig> out of the  <dig> microsatellite linkage groups . the remaining  <dig> aflp linkage groups were amongst the smallest. this suggests that neither map has a complete coverage of the genome. cja <dig> and cja <dig> had links to as many as six and seven aflp groups, respectively . generally, large aflp linkage groups were associated with linkage groups assigned to macrochromosomes  while small aflp groups were linked to integrated linkage groups assigned to microchromosomes . both the z and w aflp groups, however, were linked to the z-linked group cjaz. in some instances, one aflp linkage group is linked to two different microsatellite linkage groups. for example, the terminal marker of aflp <dig> is linked to cja <dig>  whereas the rest of aflp <dig> is linked to cja03; likewise, aflp <dig> has markers linked to cja <dig> and cja <dig> 

alignment with the chicken sequence
a blastn search of all the microsatellites on the quail map against the available chicken sequence assembly yielded significant hits for  <dig> out of  <dig>  of the quail-originated markers  . the remaining  <dig> markers had no hits. sequence identities ranged from  <dig> % to 100%, alignment scores from  <dig> to  <dig>  and e-values from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> . for a number of markers, a microsatellite, though sometimes interrupted or very short, could be found in the chicken sequence. all the type i markers, except abcb <dig>  which had no hit to the chicken genome sequence, produced significant hits, with e-values ranging from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  . these values reflect the high degree of sequence conservation between chicken and quail, especially for type i markers. although abcb <dig> had no direct hit to the chicken genome assembly, it matches the chicken est bi <dig>  which aligns with the genome assembly in the fraction of sequences not attributed to a chromosome  at  <dig>  mb.

a plot of the sequence coordinates of both type i and type ii markers on the chicken sequence assembly enabled the alignments of the integrated quail maps with chicken chromosomes, thus permitting the correct orientation and assignment of all the quail linkage groups . these alignments revealed remarkable similarity in the order of markers between chicken and quail in both the macrochromosomes  and the microchromosomes .

inconsistent marker order between the two species suggestive of local chromosomal inversions or of errors in one or the other dataset was observed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  linkage mapping has a lower resolution than the sequence assembly, but the latter may have portions of chromosomes in wrong places. it is therefore difficult to make a decision on marker order, especially as these rearrangements can be real local inversions.

all the markers present together on any of the quail linkage groups went together on a single chicken chromosome, with three notable exceptions in cja <dig>  cja <dig> and cjaz. the marker guj <dig> from linkage group cja <dig> indicated strong sequence similarity to gga <dig> sequence at position  <dig> mb. however, a comparative study between a rh map and the sequence assembly of gga <dig> showed that the portion between  <dig> and  <dig>  mb of the latter corresponds, in fact, to gga <dig>  <cit> . in the case of cja <dig> and cjaz, the markers guj <dig> and guj <dig> showed strong sequence similarity to portions of gga3_random and gga10_random, respectively. considering that these markers were assigned to "improperly" assembled portions of the chromosomes designated as "random", we decided to investigate these discrepancies. both guj <dig> and guj <dig> were genotyped on the chickrh <dig> panel  <cit>  and were found by two-point linkage analysis to co-segregate with markers belonging to gga <dig> and ggaz, respectively  <cit> . thus, when correcting chicken sequence assembly errors by rh mapping, we find that all markers from a given quail linkage group correspond to one chicken chromosome.

comparative fish studies
all  <dig> chicken bac clones tested for hybridization to quail metaphase chromosomes gave a positive fish signal. the  <dig> clones from chicken macrochromosomes 1– <dig> and z were found in almost the same order on their quail counterparts and only few differences suggesting centromeric inversions in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be detected . for chromosome  <dig>  the markers p2- <dig> and b3h <dig> are both located on the p arm in chicken whereas in quail their positions are reversed: p2- <dig> is located on the q arm close to the centromere and b3h <dig> is found in the centromeric region. in chromosome  <dig>  the markers b2b <dig> and bw107k <dig> are inverted between chicken and quail, while in chromosome  <dig> the marker bw8h <dig> on the p arm in chicken appears on the q arm in quail. all  <dig> bac clones from chicken microchromosomes hybridized to microchromosomes in quail. for seven chicken microchromosomes, two clones were chosen as far as possible from one another on the corresponding genetic linkage groups, so as to ensure a good coverage. such pairs of clones were analyzed simultaneously in dual-color fish experiments. in all cases, clones co-hybridized to the same quail microchromosome, suggesting high conservation between both species. altogether,  <dig> chicken microchromosomes were investigated, allowing identification of their quail counterparts.

discussion
integrated maps for qtl studies
to date, this is the most enhanced genetic linkage map presented for the japanese quail. it is an improvement over the microsatellite linkage map of kayang et al.   <cit> , both in terms of marker number and quality, with a number of type i loci added, and a wider coverage of the quail genome. an added value is the alignments with the aflp linkage map of roussot et al.   <cit> , thus permitting the chromosomal assignment of  <dig> out of the  <dig> aflp linkage groups. neither of the two maps looks complete and the microsatellite map has a lower number of linkage groups than chromosomes, due to the difficulty in mapping the small microchromosomes. however, the microsatellite map appears to be a great improvement over the aflp map, in which even the macrochromosomes appear to be fragmented into several linkage groups and some aflp markers seem to be assigned to the wrong linkage group. this demonstrates the limits of using aflp markers in a f <dig> cross between two lines that are only partially inbred. nevertheless, the alignment of both maps is useful as it enables a comparison of the location of qtl found in the different crosses. for instance, the qtl on tonic immobility found on the aflp linkage group  <dig>  <cit>  can now be related to the suggestive qtl for the same trait found on cja <dig>  <cit> .

the majority of poultry  genomic studies have focused on the chicken, culminating in the sequencing of its entire genome  <cit> . the slow pace of mapping in other poultry genomes primarily can be attributed to the paucity of markers, particularly microsatellites, which are the markers of choice for genetic mapping and qtl detection, and also to the fact that only a few groups work on species other than chicken. microsatellite markers are indeed difficult to develop in large numbers for poultry because of a relatively lower frequency of occurrence, when compared to mammals  <cit> . chicken microsatellite markers could be a source for the development of the quail map, but there is a low success rate of cross-species amplification between the two species  <cit> . studies by primmer et al,   <cit>  in passerine birds revealed a significant negative correlation between microsatellite performance and evolutionary distance between species, with 50% of the markers revealing polymorphism if the divergence between the original and the tested species is  <dig> million years. thus, the success rate of chicken microsatellites in quail is expected to be lower, due to a divergence that goes back to  <dig> million years  <cit> . an alternative to microsatellites for genetic mapping is to use snp. our results demonstrate that the use of information on the sequence, the structure and the position of genes in the genome of chicken, is a good approach for a targeted development of snp in a defined region in quail, in our case cja <dig> 

further compounding the situation in birds is the numerous indistinguishable microchromosomes. thus, apart from the japanese quail, preliminary genetic linkage maps have only been reported for the turkey  <cit>  but are yet to be published for most important poultry species. given the difficulty in mapping avian genomes, this integrated map is a further boost to genomic studies in quail and is a valuable resource that will improve the localization of qtl for the commercial improvement of this species and will help its promotion as a laboratory model for poultry.

chromosome rearrangements since the divergence of quail and chicken
altogether, the genetic and fish comparative maps revealed very high similarities in marker order between the two species both for the macrochromosome  and the microchromosome  fractions of the genome. therefore, all the syntenic segments investigated were conserved.

several studies suggest a high stability of avian karyotypes, which is now well documented for macrochromosomes. the karyotype of most bird orders usually share characteristic features, such as relatively high chromosome numbers , the presence of few macrochromosomes and numerous morphologically indistinguishable microchromosomes, and zz/zw sex chromosomes. comparative analyses of macrochromosomes for several bird species by using chicken whole chromosome painting probes in cross-species experiments have shown a low degree of inter-chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . the high degree of sequence identity and similarities in marker order revealed by the comparative mapping with chicken performed in the present study demonstrates that the intra-chromosomic rearrangements are also rare. however, it is not impossible that some of the differences found in marker order between the quail and chicken maps presented here may be due to the lack of precision in marker ordering on the quail genetic map or errors in the chicken genome sequence assembly. the cytogenetic data shows that the rearrangements on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all involve a change in the position of the centromere , thereby confirming similar findings by shibusawa et al.   <cit> . until now, all fish studies on microchromosomes proved a strong conservation of synteny, with hybridization to chromosomes of similar sizes. for all  <dig> chromosomes investigated, no interchromosomal rearrangements could be detected. although it is difficult to estimate the degree of coverage of microchromosomes in our study, for seven of the microchromosomes, bac clones were chosen from the ends of the chicken genetic linkage group, to maximize the chances of detecting interchromosomal rearrangements. the time of divergence between chicken and quail is estimated to be  <dig> million years  <cit> . similar times of divergence can be found between humans and new world monkeys  or humans and old world monkeys   <cit> , for which numerous interchromosomal events have been documented  <cit> . this suggests a higher stability of karyotypes in galliformes than in primates.

genome coverage by the microsatellite map
an important point when building genetic maps is to estimate the degree of genome coverage within the linkage groups. as described above, the integrated map comprises  <dig> linkage groups spanning  <dig>  cm and  <dig> unlinked markers. cja <dig>  cjaw and  <dig> microchromosomes are still missing. it is quite probable that the unlinked markers belong to these chromosomes. this is not surprising as even in chicken, the genetic map and the sequence assembly for a number of microchromosomes are far from being complete. assuming  <dig> cm for each unlinked marker, the total map distance would be  <dig>  cm. if the genome size of quail is comparable to that of chicken , then the comprehensive map represents 50% of the quail genome. indeed, apart from chromosome  <dig>  all the macrochromosomes are represented and the marker coverage and density for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in particular, are high enough to permit the localization of qtl. moreover, the presence of functional genes in the linkage groups, especially in cja <dig>  would be useful for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented here the most comprehensive quail map to date, obtained by aligning all microsatellite data with the aflp map and comparing it with the chicken sequence. these results together with our fish experiments confirm the high level of synteny conservation between the two species. the availability of a comparative map between quail and chicken will accelerate mapping studies in quail not only by facilitating the transfer of genetic information in the form of markers but also gene predictions directly from chicken to quail. the level of detail is sufficient to allow the mapping of qtl, but subsequent efforts should aim at covering the missing parts of the genome by taking advantage of the sequenced chicken genome. also, further integration of data and markers from one other group  <cit>  should be pursued.
