BACKGROUND
gene expression was profiled in prostate cells to discover candidate biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer and assessment of cancer aggressiveness. specific populations of benign and malignant cells were collected from frozen prostate tissues using laser capture microdissection . rna was isolated from the cells and amplified to obtain sufficient quantities of labeled antisense rna for microarray expression profiling. numerous publications have described amplification methods  <cit>  and linear amplification  <cit>  has been used extensively. optimization and standardization of methods will likely improve overall correlations between microarray studies  <cit> , especially for experiments involving lcm. methods upstream of rna amplification, including frozen tissue processing, are crucial for preserving rna integrity and obtaining accurate results from microarray experiments. a complete protocol for lcm, linear amplification of rna, and microarray expression profiling is presented here. the protocol includes a quantitative pcr  method for determining rna concentration and integrity that is amenable to limited quantities of rna obtained from lcm samples. confirmation of microarray results using qpcr is also presented.

RESULTS
optimization of rna quality in tissues processed for lcm
the quality of total rna extracted from stained tissues was assessed using an agilent bioanalyzer  <cit> . significant rna degradation occurred during the staining protocol, probably due to reactivation of endogenous nucleases in aqueous solutions. rnase inhibitor was, therefore, included in all staining solutions except xylene, in which it is insoluble. electropherograms of total rna extracted from serial sections of three representative prostate tissue specimens that were unstained, stained in the absence of rnase inhibitor, or stained in the presence of rnase inhibitor are presented in fig.  <dig>  relative to unstained tissues, rna degradation occurred in tissues stained in the absence of rnase inhibitor, as evidenced by a shortening and broadening of the 28s ribosomal rna peak at about  <dig> seconds. in all cases, degradation was decreased when tissues were stained in the presence of rnase inhibitor, as evidenced by recovery of the 28s ribosomal rna peak height.

quantitative measures of rna degradation, degradation factors and rna integrity numbers  <cit> , based on the electropherograms presented in fig.  <dig> are provided . these quantitative measures were in accordance with visual interpretations. we also developed a qpcr assay to characterize rna integrity using primer pairs specific for the 5' and 3' ends of the psa transcript. the qpcr results  correlated well with quality assessments based on electrophoretic traces. interestingly, tissues that appeared similar in terms of rna integrity when unstained were observed to differ significantly in rna degradation after staining, especially in the absence of rnase inhibitor.

lcm and determination of rna concentration and quality
specific cell populations based on primary gleason pattern  <cit>  were collected using lcm. epithelial cells were captured from five benign tissues and two cases with benign prostatic hyperplasia . primary gleason pattern  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cells were collected from seven, two, and eight cases, respectively. tumor cells were also collected from three cases of prostate cancer lymph node metastases. lcm images taken before, during, and after capture of primary gleason pattern  <dig> cells are presented .

we attempted to use a nanodrop® spectrophotometer to quantify the limited amounts of lcm rna because the small sample requirement  precludes the need for sample dilution. measurements typically were not reproducible, presumably because the sample concentrations were at or below the detection limit of  <dig>  ng/μl  <cit> . determination of rna quality using the agilent bioanalyzer also lacked reproducibility, even though the total rna pico assay has a qualitative range of 200– <dig> pg/μl  <cit> . we, therefore, developed a qpcr assay to assess rna quantity and integrity.

a primer set specific for the 3' end of the β-actin transcript was designed to quantify relative rna concentrations. β-actin was used for normalization rather than gapdh because gapdh expression levels have been shown to correlate with pathologic stage in human prostate tumors  <cit> . the 3' β-actin primer set was combined with another primer set specific for the middle  region of the β-actin transcript to determine 3'/m β-actin ratios for assessment of rna quality. the primer sets are designated 3' and m because the amplicons they generate fall within the target sequences used to design the 3' and m beta-actin probes on the affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  array. the ratio of the rna quantities determined using the two primer sets is indicative of rna quality. this is because oligo primer is used to synthesize cdna template for amplification in qpcr, allowing only transcripts with intact 3' ends to be detected. transcripts shortened due to degradation are detected as having less amplification of their upstream ends and, therefore, higher 3'/m ratios.

results of the analysis of rna quality and concentration based on qpcr with β-actin primers are presented in fig.  <dig> for samples obtained after lcm of  <dig> prostate tissues. since the 3'/m β-actin ratios were all two or lower, this was established as a quality control parameter for proceeding with linear amplification. one case, 586-gp <dig>  was observed to be an outlier with a 3'/m beta-actin ratio of  <dig> , and this result was reproduced. yields of rna obtained for the different cases varied substantially. yield was not observed to correlate with quality since even samples with low yield  had good quality rna. we, therefore, sought to determine if there was a correlation between yield and number of cells collected for the different cases. we used the number of laser pulses performed during capture of cells as an approximation of the number of cells collected for each case. there was no discernable correlation between yield and number of laser pulses or tissue type . individual cases appear to differ significantly in rna content, making it difficult to determine how many cells must be collected to obtain sufficient rna for linear amplification.

comparison of the ivt and enzo kits
to determine whether to use the ivt kit  <cit>  or the enzo kit in our linear amplification protocol, we performed a side-by-side comparison. samples of total rna from gleason pattern  <dig> and gleason pattern  <dig> microdissected cells were amplified and labeled using each kit. different amounts of total rna from gleason pattern  <dig> and gleason pattern  <dig> cells,  <dig>  ng and  <dig>  ng, respectively, were amplified to determine if 2- to 10-fold less than the minimum recommended amount of input rna could yield sufficient labeled crna for hybridization to a microarray. this was important since it was not feasible to obtain 10– <dig> ng of rna from microdissected cells for most of the  <dig> prostate tissues analyzed . furthermore, to avoid concentrating the rna , the total amount of rna needed for linear amplification should be contained in  <dig> μl or less . this volume is limited by the minimum volume of buffer,  <dig> μl, needed to elute rna from the purification column.

a sufficient yield of labeled crna  was obtained for each sample to hybridize  <dig> μg to a u <dig> plus  <dig>  array. correlation plots were generated using un-normalized expression data from gcos  <dig> . signal correlations  were  <dig>  for inter-assay comparisons . saturation of signal intensities for transcripts expressed at higher levels was apparent for targets prepared using the enzo kit since the plots assumed a banana shape at higher signals. in agreement with these results, previous studies indicated that use of the enzo kit to prepare targets for hybridization to the u <dig> plus  <dig>  array resulted in some degree of saturation of signal intensities for transcripts expressed at very high levels compared with data obtained on the u133a array, and the ivt kit alleviates the high-end saturation effect observed with the enzo kit  <cit> . we chose to use the ivt kit in our linear amplification protocol.

we investigated the reproducibility of the final steps of the procedure, namely fragmentation of additional aliquots of the gleason pattern  <dig> crna samples labeled using the ivt kit or the enzo kit, hybridization of the fragmented crna to u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays from a different lot, washing, staining, and scanning . enzo saturation was again evident in the correlation plot of the hybridization replicates, and the inter-assay signal correlation  was  <dig>  . for comparison, fig. 3d shows a scatter plot correlation of expression data from replicate gleason pattern  <dig> samples amplified and labeled on different days using the ivt kit. the replicates were treated the same except that different amounts of total rna  were used for amplification, and the microarrays were scanned using two different genechip® scanner  <dig> instruments. the intra-assay correlation  was better than the inter-assay correlations , and no banana shape was evident.

the hybridization replicates allowed another interesting analysis to be performed. signal correlation  between replicate hybridizations was plotted against signal intensity for gleason pattern  <dig> samples labeled using the ivt kit or the enzo kit. correlations between hybridization replicates decreased rapidly with decreasing signal intensity both for samples labeled using the ivt kit and the enzo kit . average signal intensities obtained with the ivt kit were significantly lower than those obtained with the enzo kit, shifting the entire plot to the left. signal correlations between hybridization replicates represented a best-case scenario; therefore, replicates of the entire linear amplification procedure were also analyzed. for any given intensity value, the correlation was significantly higher between the hybridization replicates than the replicates of the entire linear amplification protocol.

linear amplification of lcm rna
equivalent amounts  of total rna from normal epithelial cells, bph cells, gleason pattern  <dig> cells, gleason pattern  <dig> cells, and lymph node metastases that were microdissected from  <dig> total cases were amplified and labeled using the ivt kit as described in methods. superscript™ iii, rather than superscript™ ii, was used to synthesize cdna since it was found to be more processive . the average yield of labeled crna was  <dig> μg . the average size of the biotinylated crna was about  <dig> base pairs for each of the  <dig> cases. the average fold amplification during the first round was 60-fold, which was significantly greater than the 4–10-fold recommended by the working group  <cit> . the average fold amplification during the second round was about 800-fold, whereas it should have been about 400-fold according to the working group  <cit> . a so-called "normalizer sample" was amplified along with the other  <dig> samples. this sample consisted of rna from microdissected gleason pattern  <dig> cells. aliquots of the normalizer sample were stored at -80°c to allow one aliquot to be amplified with each subsequent batch of test samples to serve as a replicate and an indicator of batch-to-batch variability.

probesets detected as present were binned into low, medium, and high expression level categories  . the coefficient of variance for the number of probesets in each bin was generally low . we observed no apparent correlation between the yield or rna integrity based on the 3'/m β-actin assay and the number of probesets in different bins. unsupervised clustering using less than  <dig> genes grouped 5/ <dig> normal and 2/ <dig> bph cases in one clade, 5/ <dig> gleason pattern  <dig> cases in another clade, and the remaining 2/ <dig> pattern  <dig> cases in a third clade that also included 8/ <dig> gleason pattern  <dig> cases along with 3/ <dig> lymph node metastases . the normalizer sample  clustered with the high-grade samples.

principal components analysis  showed segregation of samples along eigengene vector  <dig> to be predominately by gleason pattern. from left to right, a progression was observed from benign prostatic epithelial and bph cells to gleason pattern  <dig>  gleason pattern  <dig>  and metastatic cells.

we used qpcr to confirm differential expression of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme a racemase  and hepsin detected using microarrays. aliquots of the same samples that were amplified and labeled to generate microarray results were also analyzed by qpcr before and after linear amplification. relative expression levels of amacr and hepsin measured by qpcr in unamplified samples correlated well with results obtained with amplified samples and with microarray results . both amacr and hepsin were upregulated in prostate cancer compared to benign prostatic epithelial cells. the mean fold difference for amacr expression between prostate cancer and benign cells was  <dig>   in unamplified samples,  <dig>   after linear amplification, and  <dig>   as determined by microarray analysis. the mean fold difference for hepsin expression between prostate cancer and benign cells was  <dig>   for unamplified samples,  <dig>   after linear amplification, and  <dig>   as determined by microarray analysis. the fidelity of differential gene expression was, therefore, preserved during the linear amplification procedure. correlations between microarray and qpcr data after linear amplification were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for amacr and hepsin expression, respectively. expression of hepsin was highest on average in gleason pattern  <dig> cells , and was observed to decrease in high grade, gleason pattern  <dig> and lymph node metastasis, samples  to a level intermediate between benign  and low grade, gleason pattern  <dig>  cells . interestingly, a similar pattern was observed for amacr expression .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
specific cell populations were captured based on primary gleason pattern, and their gene expression profiles were analyzed. in general, unsupervised clustering grouped cases in accordance with gleason pattern. however, the grouping was not perfect in this regard since two of seven gleason pattern  <dig> cases clustered with gleason pattern  <dig> cases and lymph node metastases. the molecular profile may provide more detailed information than the gleason pattern, indicating that the gleason  <dig> cases are more aggressive, or have the potential to be more aggressive, than expected based on histology alone.

in agreement with previous results  <cit>  we found that the type ii transmembrane serine protease hepsin is approximately 5-fold overexpressed in prostate cancer cells compared to benign prostatic epithelial cells. furthermore, metastatic cells and gleason pattern  <dig> cells, which grouped together in unsupervised clustering, had hepsin expression levels intermediate between gleason pattern  <dig> and benign cells. hepsin immunohistochemistry has indicated that the staining intensity of hormone-refractory metastatic cancers is intermediate between localized prostate tumors  and benign prostate  <cit> . the lymph node metastasis cases we analyzed were not hormone-refractory, indicating that hepsin expression may not be regulated by hormones. also in agreement with previously results  <cit>  we observed up-regulation of amacr expression in prostate cancer relative to benign cells . the expression pattern of amacr was similar to that of hepsin in that amacr expression in high grade, gleason pattern  <dig> and metastatic cancer, cells was intermediate between low grade, gleason pattern  <dig>  and benign cells. interestingly, amacr expression has been reported to be lower in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer than hormone-naïve-localized prostate cancer  <cit> , suggesting that amacr protein expression might be regulated by androgens. a subsequent report  <cit>  suggests, however, that amacr expression is not hormone-dependent, but that it may be a marker of tumor differentiation. this is consistent with the data presented here showing decreased amacr expression in gleason pattern  <dig> cells and non-hormone-refractory lymph node metastases relative to gleason pattern  <dig> cells. interestingly, in a recently published gene expression study of laser microbeam microdissected populations of prostate cancer, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia , and normal prostatic epithelial cells  <cit>  hepsin was not found to be differentially expressed between normal epithelium and pins and prostate tumors, but amacr was found to be up-regulated.

recommendations of the working group  <cit>  for fold amplification during the first and second rounds of linear amplification may not be based on experiments where minimum amounts of input rna were amplified . therefore, the relevance of these recommendations to such experiments is unclear. the ability to successfully amplify small amounts of total rna is becoming increasingly important. lcm is labor-intensive, especially given the need for significant numbers of biological replicates when analyzing human specimens. minimizing the requirements for input rna can have a significant impact on study feasibility. in addition, interest in analyzing individual cells continues to grow  <cit> .

standards for the size of biotinylated crna obtained from two cycle amplification protocols are needed. for one cycle experiments, the working group recommends that the biotinylated crna should be 500– <dig>  base pairs in size, and that samples that do not meet these criteria should be discarded  <cit> . however, two cycle amplification protocols are biased to the 3' ends of transcripts.

we developed qpcr assays to assess rna quality and quantity. our qpcr assay for rna quality is analogous to the 3'/5' and 3'/m ratios for gapdh and β-actin that are quality control parameters for affymetrix microarrays  <cit> . arcturus has also provided a qpcr protocol to assess rna quality in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues  <cit> . quantitative pcr assays are fairly reproducible  and extremely sensitive, requiring significantly less sample than the nanodrop® nd- <dig> spectrophotometer and the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer for analysis of rna quality and quantity. in addition, qpcr is a more direct, functional assay for mrna quality than analysis of ribosomal rna as a surrogate for mrna using the agilent bioanalyzer. it is also noteworthy that measurements of absorbance at  <dig> nm can be misleading because degraded rna will also contribute to the absorbance, which could give an erroneously high estimate of intact rna concentration.

using the u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays, the reliability of the signal was observed to decrease dramatically with decreased intensity . it may be possible to increase the sensitivity by hybridizing larger amounts of labeled targets to the arrays. as expected, correlations between hybridization replicates were significantly better than correlations between replicates of the entire protocol performed on different days. the correlation between biological replicates would be expected to be even less.

we compared the ivt and enzo kits using signal correlation plots. however, it is difficult to determine which kit is superior in the absence of a comprehensive set of known differences in gene expression. a better comparison could be achieved by performing spike-in experiments  <cit>  or comprehensive qpcr confirmation of differentially expressed genes.
