BACKGROUND
proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins expressed in an organism, tissues, or cells.

protein expression changes over time in response to various stimuli or to change of conditions. cellular proteome is a set of proteins expressed in a specific cell type, across various subcellular locations, whereas human proteome is a set of proteins encoded by some  <dig>  protein-coding genes of human genome  <cit> . high-throughput sequencing has shown that more than 95% of human protein coding genes produce splice variant transcripts  <cit> . more than  <dig>  protein variants resulting from alternative splicing have been annotated to date  <cit> . a wide variety of post-translational modifications  occur in proteins, often changing their structure and function. ptms include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, sulfation, oxidation, and nitrosylation, among many others  <cit> . a widely accepted estimate is that more than  <dig> million protein variants make the posttranslated human proteome in any human individual  <cit> . this estimate excludes natural recombinant proteins such as t cell receptors and antibodies and the majority of ptms.

high-throughput technologies
molecular profiling of samples representing healthy or diseased states, pre- and postintervention, or time series during disease progression is important research topic in biomedicine. such profiling supports the discovery and evaluation of cellular-level pathways of disease progression, characterization of biomarkers, identification of therapeutic targets, and their applications for improved diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and selection of therapies. this quest is supported by the emerging technologies of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. genomics technologies help identify variation of human genome and its role in disease associations, but they do not provide information about availability of transcripts . transcriptomics studies the rna transcribed from a particular genome under various conditions. transcriptomic studies link the analysis of genome and proteome because they provide critical information about gene regulation and also about availability of mrna for protein translation. principal strengths of genomics and transcriptomics lay in the ability to amplify genetic material for extraction of genetic and transcript profiles even from a single cell  <cit> . on the contrary, proteomics profiling requires utilization of larger numbers of cells. identification of proteome from a single cell is currently available for the analysis of cell lines  <cit>  as it allows for a very limited proteome analysis  <cit> . currently a single cell proteome analysis is not a viable option for clinical applications. larger samples yield better proteome coverage, while smaller samples yield progressively smaller coverage of the expressed proteome. on the other hand, transcriptome analysis provides limited information: patterns of changes in gene expression do not necessarily correlate well with patterns of changes in protein expression  <cit> . the limited correlation of transcript and protein expression is particularly notable in the study of human clinical samples. the reasons for such discrepancies include errors in measurement, noise in regulation of gene expression, presence of posttranslational modifications, variation in gene-specific regulation of translation, and varying dynamics of protein degradation under different conditions  <cit> . furthermore, genomic and transcriptomic studies cannot provide information on ptms, and quantity of proteins. about a third of transcripts, although expressed, do not get translated into proteins  <cit>  and the lifetime of proteins can differ by orders of magnitude even for proteins that have similar translation rates  <cit> . because of their limitations, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics complement each other - each of them provides a valuable but incomplete insight into molecular profiles that characterize healthy and diseased states represented by the studied sample.

to achieve clinical goals of proteomics, we need to target samples that often comprise extremely low numbers of cells. these include, among others, circulating tumor cells  <cit> , circulating endothelial cells  <cit> , samples collected using fine needle aspirates  <cit> , and samples collected by laser capture microdissection  <cit> . limited numbers of cells are available from samples that contain mixed normal and transformed  cells, which is a particular problem in tissue samples with early stage cancer  <cit> . the latest microproteomics methods enable proteome profiling from tiny samples  and are thus suitable for moving the frontier of clinical applications. such proteome studies can yield a few thousand proteins  <cit> , which was confirmed in this report. deep proteomics can yield more than  <dig>  proteins from cell line samples  <cit> , but the number of proteins identifiable from clinical samples is usually much smaller.

technological advances
significant improvements in instrumentation   <cit> , sample processing  <cit> , and bioinformatics  <cit>  help comprehensive proteome profiling. nevertheless, proteome profiling suffers from problems of incomplete data coverage and inconsistencies between individual runs  <cit> . while this problem is less pronounced in protein identification using large samples derived from cell lines where vast majority of proteins are expressed ubiquitously  <cit>  this problem is pronounced when small samples are used. goh et al.  <cit>  have argued that biological networks analysis provides robust models and interpretations that increase coverage while the analysis of protein interaction groups and biological pathways help improve coverage of proteins and complement quantitative proteomics data. they defined biological networks as groups of genes or proteins that are linked through a shared set of functional relationships and pathways as well-described biological networks involved in metabolic and regulatory processes. several methods for utilization of biological networks for improvement of identification  have been described, including analysis of overlaps, clique enrichment analysis, proteomics expansion pipeline, maxlink, and shortest-path methods . the improvement of inconsistencies between different runs can be pursued using overlap analysis, direct group analysis, and network-based analysis . gene expression profiles and pathway analysis can be used to define candidates for targeted proteomics  <cit>  discovery and improve identification sensitivity of expressed proteins. targeted proteomics is more sensitive than unbiased screening - the sensitivity of specific protein identification using targeted proteomics can be an order of magnitude larger than sensitivity of unbiased screening  <cit> .

here, we compared newly measured mcf- <dig> proteomics data from several small-size samples. the detected proteins were mapped to standardized gene names. the target proteins were predicted to be present in samples using enriched gene sets among canonical pathways collections in msigdb  <cit> . in addition, the expanded gene sets were compared to the transcriptomics data extracted from the literature. we benchmarked the consistency and coverage of proteomes identified in different small-sample runs and defined a strategy for proteome profiling and quantitation using the analysis of expressed canonical pathways.

methods
the overall design of this study is shown in figure  <dig>  small sample, as few as 50-cell, and larger sample  proteomics data from mcf- <dig>  an estrogen receptor positive  breast cancer cell line   <cit>  were compared to gene sets from msigdb and to transcriptomics data. the enrichment of detected targets among gene sets from canonical pathways  collection were calculated. the genes from enriched gene sets were used for identification and assessment of possible protein expression in the sample. the detected targets and their enriched gene sets were compared to mcf- <dig> transcriptomics data. the initial validation was performed by comparison to the partial proteome estimated to cover 50% of expressed proteins in runs comprising as much as  <dig>  cells.

data set acquisition
proteomics data
 <dig> of mcf- <dig> human breast adenocarcinoma cells  were rinsed twice with  <dig> ml volumes of dpbs and lysed with sonication on ice in  <dig> m urea,  <dig> m thiourea,  <dig> mm tcep in  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate , ph  <dig>  for  <dig> min. extracted proteins were processed using a previously described protocol <cit> . in brief, the extract was reduced in  <dig> mm tcep for  <dig> min at room temperature and alkylated in  <dig> mm iodoacetamide  for  <dig> min in the darkness. prior to digestion, the resulting lysate was diluted 10-fold with  <dig> mm abc, ph  <dig>  to bring the concentrations of urea and thiourea to  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m, respectively. protein digestion was performed with endoproteinase lys-c  for 4h at an enzyme/substrate  of approximately 1: <dig> and followed by an addition of sequencing grade trypsin  at an e:s ratio of approximately 1: <dig> and overnight digestion in a shaker at  <dig> °c. the total volume of the resulting digest was  <dig> µl.

the monolithic microspe and analytical porous layer open tubular  columns were polymerized as described in  <cit> . for lc separation,  <dig> cm of  <dig> μm i.d. ps-dvb monolithic spe precolumn was connected with a  <dig>  m plot using a picoclear tee . digested lysates were first loaded on the monolithic spe precolumn at a flow rate of  <dig> nl/min using a ncs  <dig> rs pump . then, entrapped and desalted digests were eluted off the precolumn and separated on the plot column using a linear solvent gradient at a  <dig> nl/min flow rate. the separation was performed using a 4-hour gradient of 0%-27% mobile phase b . nano esi spray was enabled using an electrospray voltage of  <dig>  kv and a distal coated tip  butt-to-butt connected with an outlet of the plot column via a zero dead volume picoclear union . ion transfer tube temperature was set for  <dig> 0c.

ms detection was performed using a top  <dig> ms/ms data-dependent scans on the q exactive  mass spectrometer. full ms scans were acquired over the range of m/z 380- <dig> th with resolution set to  <dig>  and an automatic gain control  target set to 3x <dig>  the  <dig> most intense parent ions excluding singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charges were selected for higer-energy collisional dissociation  fragmentation with a normalized collision energy  set to 28%. the ms/ms spectra were analyzed in the orbitrap mass analyzer using resolution set to  <dig>  and agc set to 1x <dig>  the isolation window was set to  <dig> m/z and dynamic exclusion was set to  <dig> s. the maximum ion injection time was set to  <dig> ms for full ms scans and  <dig> ms for ms/ms.

lc-ms/ms raw data files were analyzed using proteome discoverer  <dig>   by two search engines sequest ht  and mascot  against the uniprot human database .

carbamidomethylation  were set as variable modifications. the precursor peptide mass tolerance was set to  <dig> ppm and fragment tolerance to  <dig>  da. the results of the searches were combined and validated using the percolator module with filters set to high peptide identification confidence to achieve a false discovery rate  ≤1% for sequest and ≤ <dig> % for mascot. the proteomics data sets used in this study include proteome profiles from mcf- <dig> cell line. proteins were identified from three  <dig> min gradient runs comprising  <dig> cells each. these results were compared to data sets comprising triplicate runs with samples comprising  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mcf- <dig> cells.

transcriptomics data
gene expression data of mcf- <dig> cells  studied in patacsil et al.'s work  <cit>  were downloaded from gene expression omnibus   <cit> . the platform used in this study was affymetrix human genome u133a  <dig>  array. gene symbols were extracted from the platform data. the data from the patacsil study was selected because it has both treated and control samples that show good reproducibility of results.

there were  <dig> samples in the array data and the expression levels of these  <dig> samples were averaged for each probe. for the genes with multiple probes, the highest average measurement was kept. the variation of gene expression between samples was minimal and we consider these data highly reproducible. for example,  <dig> % of all transcripts showed the ratio of signals across  <dig> samples /average at  <dig>   and  <dig> % at  <dig>  . 3) gene sets/pathways data

canonical pathways used in this study were downloaded from msigdb  <dig>   <cit> . there are  <dig> gene sets included in this canonical pathways collection . these gene sets represent well-described biological processes compiled by domain experts, which include gene sets derived mainly from biocarta pathway database  <cit> , kegg pathway database  <cit> , and reactome pathway database  <cit> . these canonical pathways mainly include metabolic and signalling pathways that are shared by all cell types.

protein/gene pre-processing
crap proteins
the common repository of adventitious proteins  <cit>  include proteins used in proteomics experiments, contaminants, or proteins used as quantitation standards. proteins that were removed from proteomics data were: albu_bovin, aldoa_rabit, cah2_bovin, cas1_bovin, cas2_bovin, dhe3_bovin, lysc_lysen, try1_bovin and tryp_pig

proteins without gene annotation
the gene symbols were extracted from the proteomics data report. proteins without gene annotation were searched in uniprot  <cit>  for their gene symbols, if available.

hgnc gene nomenclature
the gene names/symbols in proteomics data, transcriptomics data and gene sets in msigdb are inconsistent in many cases. to solve this problem, all the approved gene symbols and their previous gene symbols/synonyms were downloaded from the hugo gene nomenclature committee - hgnc  <cit>  on 8th april,  <dig>  we screened all genes in above datasets and all gene names/symbols were mapped to the names approved by hugo.

overlapping genes between proteomics and transcriptomics data
the genes names in the transcriptomics data were sorted in descending order of their rna expression levels. the genes that were also detected in proteomics data were marked as  <dig>  while the others were marked as  <dig>  sliding window of size  <dig> was applied here: the scores were added up for every consecutive  <dig> genes on the list. this method enables inspection of the overlaps between proteomics data and the transcriptomics data and find out protein content distribution relative to the transcript expression level.

gene set enrichment analysis
hypergeometric distribution was applied to calculate the gene set enriched with proteins observed in 50-cell samples. for example, to investigate the gene set enrichment of a group of protein set ps in gene set a, probability will be calculated as:

 p=kkn-kn-knn 

where n is the number of genes in gene sets collections, k is the number of genes in gene set a, n is the number of proteins in ps, k is the number of proteins in ps that overlap with gene set a. the p-value of "if ps is enriched in a" will be calculated by summing up the probability from p to p.

gene set enrichment analysis was done for each run of proteomics data from 50-cell samples and the gene set used was cp collections. gene sets with p-value below  <dig>  were kept for further analysis.

verification of predicted genes
genes in mapped gene set were compared to the detected targets in each run and all detected targets in proteomics data as well.

RESULTS
proteins/genes detected in proteomics data
mass spectrometry proteomics analysis was performed in experiments that used samples of 50-, 100-, 500-, 1500-, and 5000-cell sample sizes. each sample was run in triplicate. the common repository of adventitious proteins  collects proteins that are commonly found in proteomics experiments due to accidents or contamination of protein samples and was used to eliminate these proteins. after removing crap and duplicate proteins from the lists, a total of  <dig>  proteins were detected from the proteomics data.

the detected protein names were mapped to the approved gene symbols according to hgnc nomenclature   <cit> , resulting in  <dig>  identified and annotated proteins. the numbers of proteins identified in individual runs are shown in figure  <dig>  larger samples yielded larger numbers of identified proteins, except for runs with  <dig> -cell samples. this decline is the artefact of saturation of specific plot column  <cit>  that was used this set of proteomics runs.

in three individual mass spectrometry runs with 50-cell samples, there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins that could be mapped to the approved gene symbols. the numbers of proteins within the "intersection", "twice" , and "union" groups were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. assuming that the expressed proteome comprises approximately  <dig>  expressed proteins  <cit> , we can make a rough estimate of proteome coverage from small sample runs. the small sample runs , therefore yielded approximately  <dig>  proteins representing 10% of the expressed proteome, while total number of proteins identified in all runs  was close to  <dig>   representing approximately 50% of expressed proteome .

rna expression level  <dig>  and  <dig>  were used as thresholds.

genes and their expression level in transcriptomics data
transcriptomics data from the patacsil study  <cit>  contained  <dig>  unique transcripts that could be mapped to the approved gene symbols. these non-redundant transcripts were sorted from high to low expression ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  units . we selected  <dig>  units as the tentative positive threshold.

mapping of proteomics data onto transcriptomics data
the analysis of the overlap between proteomics and transcriptomics data resulted in  <dig>  proteins, representing  <dig> % of the identified proteome. the remaining  <dig> % of identified proteome was not available for transcript analysis .

cumulative analysis
from the cumulative result of protein presence in the sorted transcript list , it can be seen that the cumulative sum initially rises quickly and then plateaus as the level of rna expression decreases.

sliding window analysis
to assess the relationship of transcript expression and presence of expressed proteins we analysed the presence of expressed proteins in the sliding window of  <dig> transcripts sorted from the highest to the lowest expression level. transcripts that had high expression level were more likely to have their corresponding protein expressed ranging from 98-100%  to approximately 10%  . the protein presence numbers within the 50-member transcript sliding window drops linearly from the highest expression transcripts to become stable after around ~ <dig>  transcripts in the sorted list. this corresponds well with the selected threshold for the positives of transcript expression .

enrichment of proteomics data in expression-level-grouped transcriptomics data
given the results of concordance of protein and transcript expression shown in figure  <dig>  rna expression level  <dig>  was chosen as a threshold to cluster genes in transcriptomics data: higher expression group  and lower expression group .

the gene presence of proteomics data were further analysed in these two expression groups . proteomics data in genes with higher rna expression level  is obviously more enriched than those in genes with lower rna expression level.

mapping of proteins from small samples to canonical pathways 
for each single run using a 50-cell sample, all proteins that could be mapped to the approved gene symbols were compared to all the gene sets in canonical pathway collections. gene sets in the canonical pathways collection enriched with the expressed proteins detected by mass spectrometry were mapped, and all genes present in these gene sets were extracted. the detailed results are summarized in table  <dig>  the numbers of mapped gene sets are similar across three runs indicating that similar canonical pathways were deduced from protein expression results of individual runs. among the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene sets mapped from "intersection" runs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> were identical, representing common canonical pathways shared between three runs. for the "twice" and "union" sets, larger number of canonical pathways were mapped resulting in a larger number of mapped genes.


common pathways


for  <dig> runs 
"gene sets" represent genes defined in cps. the number of genes represents the sum of different genes across mapped cp.

 <dig> not all proteins detected in 50-cell sample are present in the gene sets within the cp collection. the number of proteins found in the cp collections is shown here.

the number of proteins in the smallest set, comprising proteins that were detected in each of the three runs, was  <dig> constituting  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of proteins detected in the runs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the number of gene sets identified from each small sample proteomic run is very similar, 221- <dig>  and they are similar to the "twice" group. intersection yields the smallest number of mapped pathways,  <dig>  while "union" group yielded  <dig> gene sets. these sets are largely overlapping indicating the subsets of the same proteomes have been captured in each run.

verification of mapped genes derived from small sample
from mapped genes to proteomics data
for the targets derived from each single run of 50-cell proteomics samples,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %  were directly detected . mapping the genes using union of the three runs, resulted in capturing of approximately 20% of expressed proteome. approximately 45% of target genes identified by pathway analysis were present in the detected proteome. assuming that the detected proteome represents 50% of actual proteome, we deduced that 90% of the proposed target genes identified from cps  were be expressed as protein products in the actual proteome. this hypothesis will need to be validated experimentally. we expect that the analysis of canonical pathways, therefore, will identify about 45% of the total proteome present in the samples. these canonical pathways mainly include metabolic and signalling pathways that are shared by all cell types. the remaining 55% of actual proteome will include proteins that do not have defined transcripts, or those that are defined by tissue-, process-, or disease-specific pathways.

from mapped genes to transcriptomics data
approximately 83% of the mapped genes from cps from any single run of 50-cell samples can be found in transcriptomics data . furthermore, of the proteins detected in any of the proteomic runs from our data, 80% can be found in transcriptomics data. the proportion of detected proteins that can be found in transcriptomic data, therefore, is similar for small and larger samples. however the overlap between the mapped genes and detected proteins is only 45% . our results might be biased since mapped genes are members of the canonical pathways, while this bias does not exist in protein detection. furthermore, transcriptome profiling was done in a different study and, although transcript and protein expression of mcf- <dig> cell line is expected to be relatively stable, our results are likely to capture the study-specific differences.

the mapping data was further compared to the two rna expression groups ≥ <dig>  and < <dig>  . looking at data from run  <dig> in 50-cell sample for example, the number of proteins detected in run  <dig>  gene expression data, and proteins detected in all proteomic runs were compared . only  <dig> %  that were detected in 50-cell run  <dig> have transcript expression of less than  <dig> . of all detected proteins,  <dig> %  have transcript expression of less than  <dig> . this result is consistent with the sliding window analysis  where approximately 10%  of proteins were shown to have low rna expression . for mapped proteins in run  <dig>  this proportion is  <dig> %  indicating that some of the targets deduced from cps, possibly 10% of the total, do not have protein product.

alternatively, these differences may be attributed to differences in samples used in transcriptomic and proteomic experiments, but may also represent the products that are part of canonical pathways that do not have protein expression in the studied samples.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
small sample analysis of expressed proteome is critical for many clinical samples since they represent points in time for disease progression in individual patients. we used the mcf- <dig> breast cancer cell line to benchmark the number of proteins that can be detected by using microscale proteomics and have developed strategies to increase the coverage of protein detection.

proteomics data suffer from problems of coverage and consistency. the problem becomes worse as the sample size diminishes. in this study, pathway analysis has been confirmed as a useful method for improving protein identification in proteomics data. approximately  <dig>  proteins were detected in each small sample run followed by the identification of approximately  <dig>  possible expressed protein targets. the proteomics data from larger samples experimentally validated approximately half of these probable targets in this study. comparing these  <dig>  possible targets to transcriptomics data, more than 80% of targets are highly likely to be present, especially enriched in the group of higher rna expression. our estimate is that only 10% of predicted proteome by canonical pathways may represent false positives. in addition, it appears that the predicted proteomes based on each individual run, intersection of proteins from three runs, or union of proteins from all three runs will produce very similar predicted proteomes. this indicates a remarkable robustness of the method reported in this study.

naming conventions and nomenclature raise a problem when processed data are derived from multiple sources. it is also a problem when data are derived from a single source at different time points because of the changes and updates of gene and protein names. we have used the standardized symbols and have mapped proteomics, transcriptomics, and gene set  data to the common list of hugo gene symbols. approximately 20% of detected proteome could not be mapped to the hugo gene symbols because these proteins either did not have corresponding gene symbols, the names were ambiguous and could not be resolved, or the products have been removed from the recent database update as obsolete or redundant.

proteomics technology has improved and we can detect a significant proportion of the expressed proteome from small samples, such as  <dig> cells samples. however this detection initially amounts to only 10% of the estimated total expressed proteome. knowledge-based approaches are needed to elucidate the likely presence of proteins that can be subsequently detected by targeted proteomics. these kb-approaches include analysis of pathways and combination of gene expression and protein expression data. using meta-analysis, we have shown that most of the proteins, perhaps 90%, identified as members of canonical pathways - pathways common for all cell types - are likely to be expressed as proteins. these proteins represent approximately 50% of the expressed proteome. the remaining proteins can be elucidated by the analysis of tissue-, organ-, process-, or disease-specific pathways. furthermore, targets that are represented by highly expressed transcripts are more likely to be expressed as proteins . approximately 10% of transcripts that show low or no expression have their proteins expressed, as detected in the proteomics runs. this may include a number of false positives due to different sources used in this study for the analysis of transcriptome and proteome, but it is highly likely that the majority of expressed proteins are real.

in summary, proteomics detection of protein expression from small samples can be enriched by pathway analysis followed by targeted proteomics. furthermore, gene expression data can be used for prioritization of potential targets for deep proteomics screening. this study has provided benchmark results that will facilitate proteogenomics studies for detecting expressed proteomes from samples comprising small numbers of cells.
