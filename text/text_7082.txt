BACKGROUND
mobile dna, such as long terminal repeats , long interspersed elements , short interspersed elements  and sine-vntr-alus , constitute up to 45% of the human genome. these retrotransposable elements are mobilised via a ‘copy and paste’ mechanism; namely a rna intermediate is reverse transcribed into dna which inserts back into the genome at a different loci to the source sequence. historically svas were originally identified as a sequence derived from part of the env gene and a 3′ltr from the herv-k <dig> endogenous retrovirus with a poly a-tail and a gc-rich tandem repeat directly upstream and were named sine-r elements  <cit> . it was later shown that in the c <dig> gene, the gc tandem repeat of the sine-r element was a variable number tandem repeat   <cit> . this composite element was termed a sine-vntr-alu  when further analysis of its components revealed the alu-like sequences adjacent to the vntr  <cit> . thus typically svas consist of a hexamer repeat , an alu-like sequence, a gc-rich vntr, a sine and a poly a-tail.

such svas, which are hominid specific, are to date the smallest of the retrotransposon families identified with  <dig> elements found in the hg <dig> amounting to  <dig> % of the genome. a precursor of the vntr domain found within the svas is present within the rhesus macaque genome, many of these precursor elements are also present in the human genome suggesting they were retrotransposing prior to the divergence of the old world monkeys and the hominoids  <cit> . svas are divided into subtypes  by the sine region and their age estimated at  <dig> myrs old for the oldest subtype  and  <dig> myrs old for the youngest subtype   <cit> . a seventh subtype has been identified that contains a 5’ transduction of the sequence from the first exon of the mast <dig> gene and associated cpg island and has been referred to as either cpg-sva, mast <dig> sva or sva f <dig>  <cit> . the sequence of the mast <dig> loci that has been incorporated into the f <dig> structure has been shown to act as a positive regulator of transcription in a reporter gene construct when transfected into human germ cells and is thought to have contributed to the success of the subtype in its retrotransposition  <cit> . subtypes e, f and f <dig> are human specific as are some members of sva subtype d. the younger subtypes appear to contain two gc rich vntrs as opposed to the one seen in the older subtypes.

svas are non autonomous and are mobilised by the line- <dig> protein machinery  <cit> , their retrotransposition rate is estimated at  <dig> in every  <dig> births  <cit> . a recent study to determine the nature of sva retrotransposition revealed that no individual domain of an sva is fundamental for this to occur, but each domain differentially affected the rate at which retrotransposition can take place  <cit> . to date eight sva insertions have been associated with disease  <cit> , these include for example a sva in the 3’utr of the fukutin gene which causes fukyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy by decreasing mrna production, and a sva insertion and subsequent 14 kb deletion of the hla-a gene locus linked with leukaemia  <cit> . retrotransposition events are repressed in somatic cells via epigenetic modifications and post transcriptional suppression but there is recent evidence for these events occurring in the adult brain and their insertions are associated with protein coding genes active in the brain  <cit> . in tumour cells, svas along with other retrotransposons become demethylated and potentially could lose the epigenetic modifications that silenced them  <cit> . the latter indicates that retrotransposons including svas could modify the genomic structure of a locus with associated consequences for regulation without the requirement for retrotransposition.

the nature of the sequence contained within svas shows the potential for formation of secondary structures such as cruciforms and g-quadruplexes   <cit> . g <dig> dna is a secondary structure predicted from bioinformatic analysis to form in guanine-rich sequences, but validation in vivo is difficult and highly debated  <cit> . g <dig> structures are hypothesised to interfere with replication of dna and be involved in a host of regulatory functions including gene expression, genome stability and telomerase activity  <cit> .

svas contain large domains of repetitive dna  similar in copy number and size of individual repeats to those, we and others, have found to direct differential tissue specific and stimulus inducible gene expression in many other genes  <cit> . this differential regulator property has been correlated with copy number of the vntr in some genes  <cit> . for example, we and others have demonstrated that vntrs located in the promoter and second intron of the human serotonin transporter gene  are differential as both risk factors for mental health and tissue specific regulators in the context of reporter gene constructs, in vivo and in vitro based on the copy number of the repeat  <cit> .

in this communication we have determined the global location of svas, and then focused on the individual variation and function of a single selected sva located in the park <dig> gene promoter. the park <dig> sva was chosen because it is human specific, was regarded as a complete sva and because of the nature of its location in relation to the park <dig> gene. we addressed the potential function of this sva as a transcriptional regulator, by investigating its activity in a reporter gene construct.

RESULTS
distribution of sva elements across the human genome
the sva density of each chromosome was found to be positively correlated with gene density  as shown in figure 1a . the correlation coefficient for the relationship between gene density and sva density was calculated using the bootstrap confidence interval  to remove outliers. however when the density of each sva subtype was analysed individually, a negative correlation with gene density across chromosomes was found for subtype a, whereas all other subtypes showed a positive correlation . the oldest of the subtypes, a, show a clear difference in the pattern of insertion in the genome to the rest of this family of retrotransposons, however the mechanism behind this is unclear.

to dissect the distribution of svas further, the genome was divided into the three following regions: genes, intergenic and gene deserts and the observed distribution of members of the four classes of retrotransposon  was compared to the expected. the expected number of each element was determined by calculating the number of elements that would be present in the region in relation to its size if the elements inserted randomly throughout the genome. gene deserts were defined as regions between genes which were 250 kb away from the start or end of a known gene, intergenic as regions between genes that are less than 250 kb from the start or end of a known gene and genes were determined by the ucsc gene track from the ucsc genome browser. the regions were defined in this manner to assess if the retrotransposons had preferentially inserted into regions devoid of genes  or regions of the genome that could include active chromatin where genes and intergenic regions potentially containing regulatory domains  are located  <cit> . the distribution of the different classes of retrotransposons shared some similarities, in particular a lower number than expected were found in gene deserts and all classes showed a significant difference in their actual distribution to the expected across the three regions analysed, figure 1b . the distribution of svas was further analysed by subtype within the previously defined regions: genes, intergenic and gene deserts . the sva subtypes showed a significant difference in their distribution within gene deserts compared to the whole genome  but not within genes and intergenic regions . subtypes d, e and f <dig> were underrepresented in gene deserts whereas subtype b in particular was found in higher numbers. the svas also showed a significant increase in regions 1-100 kb directly upstream of transcriptional start sites when the observed number was compared to the expected for the size of these regions  . the subtype distribution was significantly different within the first kilobase upstream of the start of transcription ; subtypes a, b and e were found in lower numbers than expected and there were a greater number of subtypes c and d.

potential of sva subtypes to form g-quadruplexes
we investigated the potential of svas, more specifically the ccctct hexamer repeat at the 5’ end and the more central vntr region, to form g <dig> dna. of the total genomic dna that can form g <dig> dna   <dig> % is due to svas which only constitute  <dig> % of the human genome. when repetitive or mobile dna elements, which include simple repeats, microsatellites, ltrs, lines, sines and dna transposons  are compared; svas have the greatest potential contribution to g <dig> dna for their size for any specific element . the sequence of the park <dig> sva is shown in figure  <dig> with the bases that contribute to its g <dig> potential predicted by quadparser software in italics.

it was found that the percentage of sequence in each sva subtype with the potential to form g <dig> increased as the age of the subtype decreased, thus subtypes e, f and f <dig> have the greatest potential for g <dig> formation . this can be explained by the increase in the potential of the central vntr region to form g <dig> dna from subtype d through to f <dig>  the possible amount of g <dig> formed by the ccctct repeat was found to increase through subtypes a to e; however the proportion it contributed to the total g <dig> potential of each subtype decreased. subtype f <dig> does not contain a ccctct repeat therefore all of its g <dig> potential is within the central vntr.

the average number of repeats in the ccctct domain varied between subtypes  which accounts for the difference in g <dig> potential between the sva subtypes in this particular domain; the longer the ccctct domain the greater the g <dig> potential. the average length of the gc rich vntrs also varied between subtypes but length did not show the same direct correlation with g <dig> potential as in the ccctct domain. for example the vntrs of subtype a are just under half the length of those of subtype f <dig>  however they have only a hundredth of the potential to form g <dig> dna when compared to the vntr sequences of subtype f <dig> . it appears that the subtypes fall into two main groups when analysing the g <dig> potential in the vntrs. subtypes a, b and c have very low g <dig> potential in their vntrs compared to subtypes e, f and f <dig> with subtype d bridging the difference between the older hominid specific and younger human specific subtypes. this can be explained by the development of the additional second vntr of the younger subtypes with differences in the primary nucleotide content to the first vntr containing sequences that have the potential for g <dig> dna .

genetic variation of park <dig> sva
we analysed in detail the primary sequence and repeat variation in the human specific sva d found upstream of the park <dig> gene. the park <dig> sva is located 8 kb upstream of the park <dig> major transcriptional start site defined by both the ucsc browser  and the literature  <cit> . a putative alternative park <dig> transcript also exists, that would originate within 1 kb of this sva based on expressed sequence tags and other data in the ucsc browser and archive ensembl . genotypic analysis of this sva identified four distinct alleles which were polymorphic in length, in  <dig> individuals from the ceu  hapmap cohort with allelic frequencies shown in table  <dig>  alleles  <dig> and  <dig> were the most common within this cohort with 94% of the individuals having at least one of these alleles. the primary sequence of allele  <dig> of the park <dig> sva is shown in figure  <dig> with the different domains, vntrs, sine and alu-like, identified. figure  <dig> also shows the cpgs underlined and the bases that contribute to the park <dig> sva’s g <dig> potential in italics. allelic variation was found to be generated by differences in the number of repeat units present of specific repetitive elements within the sva, namely the ccctct hexamer repeat and in the most 3’ of the two large central vntrs. vntr variation within the cohort was analysed by pcr and confirmed by a more limited sequence analysis of specific variants. the hexamer domain was either a  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> repeat domain, and the second vntr consisted of either  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> repeats with a repeat length of 37-52 bp in this cohort. we observed no variation in the number of repeats in the most 5’ of the central ‘vntrs’, which was a stable  <dig> copy variant of 37-40 bp repeat length, which was therefore termed a tandem repeat . schematic in figure 4a shows the structure of the complete park <dig> sva and the variation found in its repetitive regions is summarised in table  <dig> 

the alleles are numbered 1– <dig> from shortest to longest.

genomic dna from individuals in the ceu  hapmap cohort was analysed. the length variation detected occurred in the ccctct hexamer repeat  and within a second repetitive vntr region further downstream. in this cohort a repetitive domain here termed a tr was not found to vary between the individuals within this population; this tr was located upstream of the second vntr. the alleles were numbered 1– <dig> from shortest to longest. one example of each type of allele was sequenced.

functional activity of park <dig> sva in reporter gene analysis
we addressed whether both the intact park <dig> sva and its distinct individual domains could act as transcriptional regulators. svas can be found in the same, or opposite orientation to the gene they are located near to. when analysed, 49% of the svas found within 10 kb upstream of transcriptional start sites were on the same strand as the gene, for these reasons we also tested whether their function was orientation dependant. eight reporter gene constructs were generated  containing the following fragments in both forward and reverse orientations:

• the whole sva 

• sva with the sine region deleted 

• central tr and vntr 

• a 5’ truncation with only the ccctct hexamer, alu-like sequence and  <dig> of the  <dig> repeats of the tr of allele  <dig> of the park <dig> sva  present

svas are described as having a ccctct domain at their 5’ end and a poly a-tail at their 3’ end therefore this was used to define the forward orientation. we compared the ability of the eight fragments to support reporter gene expression  directed by a heterologous minimal promoter in two cell lines sk-n-as, a human neuroblastoma cell line and mcf- <dig>  a human breast cancer cell line.

in the sk-n-as cell line  the intact park <dig> sva in forward orientation did not alter the levels of reporter gene expression, when compared to the minimal promoter alone  however when the sine domain was deleted reporter gene activity was significantly enhanced . the tr/vntr and the truncated sva in the forward orientation acted to significantly repress luciferase activity when compared to the minimal promoter alone  . when the domains were tested in the reverse orientation the reporter gene levels were all significantly different when compared to the levels seen in the forward orientation . the activity of the sva and sva wo sine in reverse orientation were reduced compared to when in the forward orientation whereas the activity of the tr/vntr and truncated sva showed the opposite trend.

the reporter gene constructs showed distinct activity levels in the mcf- <dig> cell line when compared to that observed in the sk-n-as cell line . in forward orientation the complete sva had a significant increase in reporter activity in mcf- <dig> cells , distinct from its function in sk-n-as, however similarly to sk-n-as cells the sva wo sine showed the greatest ability to enhance reporter gene activity. in contrast the tr/vntr showed similar activity to that of the minimal promoter alone. the truncated sva acted as a repressor as it did in the sk-n-as cell line . the domains in the reverse orientation all showed a significant difference to the activity of the domains in the forward orientation . the sva, sva wo sine and tr/vntr all showed decreased activity in the reverse orientation when compared to the domains in the forward orientation. the truncated sva showed greater activity in the reverse orientation than when in the forward orientation.

discussion
retrotransposons, including svas, can affect gene function by multiple mechanisms particularly when inserted into protein coding regions  <cit> . they have also been suggested to modulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional parameters based partially on their location within introns and promoters, however the functional significance of these non coding integrations is much more difficult to determine than those in exons. epigenetic silencing which suppresses retrotransposition in somatic cells might have modulator effects on transcriptional or post transcriptional domains adjacent to sites of integration. removal of such epigenetic silencing may correlate with retrotransposition in the aging cns  <cit>  and the observed hypomethylated state of svas in cancer  <cit> . this may suggest the potential for a dynamic chromatin structure over the locus of the svas under specific environmental conditions and challenges. in either circumstance the svas have the potential to influence the local genome architecture via epigenetic modifications, the formation of secondary structures and the binding of sequence specific transcription factors to the sva.

using the most recent version of the human genome, hg <dig>  we have demonstrated a minimum of  <dig> sva insertions in the human genome. this is considerably less in number than seen in the other classes of retrotransposons; this can be explained by the fact that they are the most recent family to integrate and proliferate in the genome. it is also likely that the primary dna sequence of the members of this family has undergone the least number of alterations which may also suggest svas share related biochemical and functional properties. these properties will in part be directed by the primary sequence of the sva to allow for such as interaction with transcription factors and other modulators of genome function acting as sequence specific binding proteins. a further regulatory function of the sva could be directed by the genomic structure adopted upon insertion. superimposed on these regulatory parameters could be modulation of their activity by the polymorphic nature of the distinct domains within the sva such as the vntr elements. there is an extensive literature on vntr domains both being differentially associated with disease and transcriptional properties based on the copy number of the repeats  <cit> . in this study we addressed firstly the site of integration of sva elements, secondly the potential secondary structures formed and finally a detailed analysis of the park <dig> sva’s ability to support reporter gene expression and its polymorphic nature. these are properties that would not only be involved in changing the transcriptome of a cell in disease states such as cancer, but also potentially a major driving force in evolution of the hominids.

we have characterised a preferential insertion of svas into genic regions , which may reflect the more accessible and open nature of the chromatin to allow for transcription and therefore more amenable to retrotransposon insertions than inactive chromatin. this is reflected in the finding that 62% of svas are within genes or their 10 kb flank. waves of sva retrotransposon integration in the hominids could alter significant number of genes via transcriptional/post transcriptional mechanisms which could act to initiate distinct cascades of gene expression changes which may have major phenotypic affects on cell function. there were also a greater number of svas than expected in key regions of the genome such as promoters , these insertions have placed them where they could potentially influence transcription. the analysis of the prevalence of svas upstream of tss was used to determine that throughout potentially regulatory regions of the genome svas are overrepresented. the cg-rich nature of the primary sequence of the svas  <cit>  provides potential regions for methylation, many svas are located near the transcriptional start site of genes, therefore the methylation status of these elements could influence the expression of the gene as hypothesised for cancer  <cit> . throughout the svas, their subtypes and domains share similar primary sequences; which provides the potential for binding similar sequence specific binding factors that could affect aspects of transcription or post transcriptional processing. the end result could be subsets of svas which respond to similar cellular signalling pathways which are dependent on chromatin structure.

primary dna sequence which contains stretches of tandem guanine nucleotides can fold into four-stranded structures called g <dig> dna, which are implicated in gene expression, replication and telomere maintenance  <cit> . the presence of g <dig> sequences along with abnormal hypomethylation was shown to be enriched in breakpoints mapped in cancer genomes, leading to the hypothesis that loss of methylation in regions with g <dig> sequences is part of the mutagenic processes in cancer  <cit> . computational analyses using such as the quadparser programme have suggested these structures are prevalent in the human genome with data demonstrating their function in vitro <cit> . svas contain sequences with g <dig> potential, specifically in their ccctct hexamer and central vntr , therefore could show similar properties to already characterised functions of g <dig> dna mentioned previously. of particular interest would be the hypothesised mutagenic properties of g <dig> sequences in demethylated regions in cancer as it has been demonstrated that svas experience a loss of methylation in cancer  <cit> . the amount of g <dig> potential and the domain of the sva it was predominantly located in varied across the different subtypes. the older subtypes  had the lowest potential; which was mostly located within the 5’ ccctct repeat, whereas the younger human specific  demonstrated the greatest potential for g <dig> with an increase in the amount located in the central vntr. subtype d showed itself to be an intermediate of the two groups.

the polymorphic nature of svas extends to their presence or absence in the genome, this has been analysed for a group of human specific svas, it was estimated that  <dig> % of sva es and  <dig> % of sva fs were polymorphic in their occurrence in the genome  <cit> . the frequency of this presence or absence of specific svas located in hla genes has shown to be variable between groups with different ethnic origins  <cit> . this demonstrates the variability of sva insertions between individuals; our study extends the analysis of their polymorphic nature to include the variation found in the ccctct hexamer repeat and provides further evidence of the already characterised variation in the second domain of the central vntr . our data demonstrates the park <dig> sva has at least four alleles which show variation in the two regions above, which interestingly are also the major regions for potential g <dig> dna.

the final parameter we explored was the potential for the sva to act as a transcriptional regulator in a classical reporter gene model . although this assay did not allow us to address epigenetic parameters it did allow us to address whether the primary sequence of the sva could interact with transcription factors to modulate transcriptional properties and further allowed us to delineate potential distinct regulatory domains in the sva. the definition of the latter was particularly important given the accepted composite nature of domains in svas; tandem repeat structures are a class of regulatory dna which we and others have demonstrated can direct tissue specific and stimulus inducible expression in vitro and in vivo both in mammals and herpes simplex virus  <cit> . we focused our analysis on the human specific sva in the promoter of the park <dig> gene. as shown in figure 4b and c the central tr/vntr differentially supported reporter gene expression in the two cell lines analysed. it demonstrated repressive qualities in the neuroblastoma cell line sk-n-as but not in the breast cancer cell line mcf- <dig> when in the forward orientation. these cell lines were selected they are well characterised and accepted to represent neuronal function  and breast cancer  because park <dig>  also termed dj- <dig>  is associated with both breast cancer and early onset parkinson’s disease  <cit> , further they provide preliminary functional data on the ability of the park <dig> sva to affect expression in different environments. we have previously shown that vntrs can function in a tissue specific manner so the distinct functions in the cell line models were not unexpected.

the complete sva showed no activity in the sk-n-as cell line but enhanced reporter gene expression in mcf- <dig> cells. interestingly the deletion of the sine element from the sva fragment resulted in significantly higher levels of reporter gene expression than the sva alone in both cell lines. this leads us to postulate that there are probably a minimum of three distinct functional elements in the sva that adjust its ability to modulate expression, the central tr/vntr, sine and the ccctct and alu-like sequences. the data on the central tr/vntr indicated they support distinct transcriptional properties dependent on cell type. this is consistent with the action of vntrs we have previously observed in the human serotonin and dopamine transporter genes  <cit> . we would expect that different complements of transcription factors present in both these cell lines are responsible for the activity of the reporter gene directed by the tr/vntr.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose that svas have inserted preferentially into genic regions placing them in areas of the genome where they have the potential to affect transcription or post transcriptional regulation through several mechanisms such as methylation state, provision of multiple transcription factor binding sites or formation of dna secondary structures. we studied the park <dig> sva in detail, demonstrated its ability to differentially affect transcription within a reporter gene construct in two different cell lines and identified at least four alleles for this particular sva with multiple regulatory domains. we and others have previously demonstrated the functional consequences, transcriptional properties or utilisation as a biomarker in the human genome for both mental health and cancer of vntrs. therefore mechanistically the polymorphic variation we observed can potentially affect several parameters. we also demonstrated in silico that the ccctct and central vntr domains have the potential to form distinct secondary structures , which impart function. there was an increase in the amount of g <dig> potential, in particularly in the central vntr, as the svas progressed to the younger human specific subtypes as changes occurred in their structure and sequence.
