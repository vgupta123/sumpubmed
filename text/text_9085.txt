BACKGROUND
moraxella catarrhalis is an exclusively human, mucosal respiratory tract commensal and pathogen causing between 5%  <cit>  and 20% of cases of acute otitis media in children  <cit>  across all regions of the world. the recent introduction of routine infant immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has - in some studies  <cit>  - led to a substantial increase in otitis media caused by m. catarrhalis  <cit> . it is thus a major cause of the most common bacterial infection in children requiring medical attention. m. catarrhalis also triggers approximately 10% acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  in adults  <cit> 

in our attempts to identify cold shock regulated outer membrane proteins  of m. catarrhalis  <cit>  we investigated a recently described omp called m <dig>  we found no evidence of cold shock regulation, but the construction of an isogenic mutant lacking the expression of a currently incompletely described omp of m. catarrhalis provided us with the opportunity to conduct a phenotypic analysis of the function of m <dig>  meanwhile, in an elegant series of experiments, easton and co-workers  <cit>  demonstrated that m <dig> is a typical gram-negative om porin, which also is essential for short-term nasal colonization of mice. importantly, porins of gram-negative bacteria not only assure bacterial homeostasis by acting as transport channels, but are also known to afford virulence mechanisms such as adhesion, invasion  <cit> , and pro-inflammatory stimulation.  <cit> . in addition, porins are often involved in antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . porins of m. catarrhalis have received little attention in the scientific literature. gotho et al. described the permeability for beta-lactam antibiotics across the om of m. catarrhalis suggesting that porins may be involved  <cit> . lafontaine et al investigated the porin-like omp cd, which acts as an adhesin on lung cells  <cit> . thus, m <dig> is currently the only well characterized porin of m. catarrhalis  <cit> .

the aims of the present study were  to provide an overview of phenotypic differences between the strains o35e,  <dig> and  <dig> and their respective isogenic m <dig> mutants,  to investigate whether m <dig> is a human mucosal antigen and thus a potential vaccine candidate,  to evaluate the role of m <dig> in the susceptibility of m. catarrhalis to various classes of antimicrobial agents, and  to provide the dna sequence m <dig> of strain  <dig>  which is a representative of the phylogenetically older major lineage  of m. catarrhalis  <cit> .

methods
bacterial strains and culture conditions
the m. catarrhalis strains and their isogenic m <dig> mutants used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  all strains were cultured at 37°c and 150- <dig> rpm in brain heart infusion  broth  or on bhi agar plates in an atmosphere containing 5% co <dig>  media were supplemented with kanamycin  for culturing of the mutants. to investigate growth under different osmotic conditions, strains were cultured in bhi broth overnight at 37°c and  <dig> rpm. one ml of overnight culture was diluted 1: <dig> in fresh bhi supplemented with  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m or  <dig>  m nacl, respectively, and incubated at 37°c and  <dig> rpm. during cultivation to the stationary phase cell density was measured at od <dig>  the effect of exposure to different acidic environments was measured by growing bacteria in bhi broth overnight, harvesting and resuspending them in  <dig> mm na2hpo4/nah2po <dig>   <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm l-arginine adjusted to ph  <dig> , ph  <dig> , ph  <dig> , or ph  <dig> , respectively. suspensions were incubated for  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, at 37°c, and the number of viable bacteria was quantified by plating of serial dilutions. iron utilization experiments were performed by a disk feeding assay applying  <dig> μl of iron-saturated human lactoferrin  to sterile filter disks  <cit> . bhi agar plates were previously iron depleted by adding deferoxamine mesylate  to a final concentration of  <dig> μm and incubated at 4°c overnight before use. escherichia coli dh5α was grown on luria-bertani  agar plates or in lb broth.

m. catarrhalis  <dig> m35
dna methods
plasmids were isolated using the wizard plus sv miniprep dna purification system  dh5α was transformed as described previously  <cit> . restriction enzymes were purchased from new england biolabs, inc., beverly, ma. electrocompetent m. catarrhalis was prepared and dna was electroporated as described  <cit> . dna sequencing was performed by using an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyzer  with the big dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit . sequences were analyzed with the lasergene software . for sequencing of m <dig> of strain  <dig>  dna was amplified using the primers m35b <dig> , m35f <dig> , m35rmj <dig> , m35f <dig> , m35r <dig>  and m35fmj <dig> .

construction of the isogenic mutants o35e.m <dig>   <dig> m <dig> and  <dig> m35
part of the m <dig> gene of the strains o35e,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, was amplified using forward primer m35f <dig>  and reverse primer m35b <dig> . pcr products were ligated into the bamhi restriction site of pgem-t-easy puc4k . the kanamycin cassette was ligated into the avrii restriction site of the m <dig> insert. the resulting construct, Δm35:kan, was used for electroporation of the competent strains o35e,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. transformants were selected on bhi agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml of kanamycin. insertional inactivation of m <dig> was confirmed by pcr analysis, sequencing, southern blot analysis  and immunoblotting .

preparation of omp
omp were prepared by the edta buffer method as described  <cit> . bacteria were harvested from a stationary phase culture, resuspended in edta buffer , homogenized and incubated at 55°c at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> h. cells and cell debris were eliminated by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. finally, omp were collected by ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> h at 4°c.

2d-gel electrophoresis and maldi-tof
analysis of m <dig> and other omp spots of strain o35e was performed a described previously  <cit> , except for the precipitation of the omp, which was omitted.

sds-page gel electrophoresis and immunoblot for detection of human anti-m <dig> iga
samples were resolved by sds-page using a  <dig> % polyacrylamide gel. band intensity was quantified using the alphaeasefc® program from inotech, inc. antibody detection was performed by western blot analysis. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes . iga binding was detected using human saliva samples as primary antibody source and goat anti-human iga, respectively, labeled with horseradish peroxidase  as secondary antibody. super signal west pico chemiluminescent substrate  was used for detection of antibody binding. unstimulated human saliva was collected from healthy volunteers using salivette sponges® , centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> rpm and stored at -20°c. all volunteers were laboratory researchers and provided oral informed consent. sampling of saliva from healthy volunteers was approved by the local ethics committee.

antimicrobial resistance testing
the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, meropenem, erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin were determined by e-test®  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

autoagglutination and serum bactericidal assay
overnight cultures were resuspended in pbs and adjusted to an od <dig> of  <dig>  in glass tubes. od <dig> of the supernatants were determined after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes, respectively. serum bactericidal assay were performed as previously reported  <cit> .

human cell lines and growth conditions
chang conjunctival cells and a <dig> lung cells were maintained in eagle's minimal essential medium  supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum,  <dig> units/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin, and  <dig> mm l-glutamine at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  the thp- <dig> human monocytic cell line was maintained in rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with  <dig> mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum,  <dig>  mm β-mercaptoethanol,  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig> units/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin at 37°c in 5% co <dig> 

adherence and invasion assay
the ability of m. catarrhalis to adhere to and invade human epithelial cells in vitro was measured as described previously  <cit> . adherence and invasion was assessed on both chang conjunctival cells and a <dig> lung cells as described  <cit> . each strain was analyzed in triplicate in each experiment.

proinflammatory activity of m <dig> on human monocytes
the pro-inflammatory potential of m. catarrhalis omp was described previously  <cit> . to investigate if m <dig> is an important mediator of proinflammatory cytokine release on the bacterial cell surface, thp- <dig> cells  were stimulated with different concentrations  of heat inactivated strain o35e or the o35e.m <dig> mutant and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  after incubation, cells were centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig>  × g and supernatants were stored at -80°c. cytokines were measured using the r&d systems dy <dig> for human cxcl8/il- <dig> and r&d systems dy <dig> for human tnfα/tnfsf1a , respectively.

statistical analysis
comparison of several test series was evaluated by analysis of variance . the significance of differences between treatment and control groups was determined using the two-tailed t-test. p <  <dig>  was considered as statistically significant. each value represents the mean ± one standard deviation of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

RESULTS
in vitro growth of m <dig> mutants
standard growth curves of the three wild-type/mutant pairs in bhi broth revealed no difference in growth velocity measured as broth density at od <dig> . because porins are frequently involved in stress responses of bacteria against changes in osmolarity or ph  <cit> , we investigated the wild-type/mutant pairs with respect to growth at various osmotic  and acidic  conditions . again, wild-type strains and their respective mutants behaved identically.

m <dig> knockout is not associated with upregulation of a  <dig> kda omp
easton et al.  <cit>  described the upregulation of a  <dig> kda protein in one of their isogenic m <dig> mutants. in order to confirm this observation, we compared coomassie-blue stained omp profiles of our three strains with their respective m <dig> mutants, but failed to detect any discernible upregulation of other omp as determined by measuring protein band intensities . thus, removal of m <dig> does not appear to affect the omp composition when bacteria are grown in bhi. taken together, the data presented thus far indicate that m <dig> is not essential for growth in vitro and that its removal from the om does not otherwise affect the omp composition.

m <dig> is expressed in vivo
the human mucosal antibody response to om components of m. catarrhalis has been described in detail  <cit> , but m <dig> has never been paid specific attention. in order to search for human antibodies against m <dig>  omp of the strains o35e,  <dig>   <dig> and their isogenic mutants were resolved by sds-page, transferred to pvdf membranes, and incubated with human saliva for detection of iga. western blot analysis for anti-m <dig> iga with  <dig> different donors resulted in antibody signals to all three strains with the strains  <dig> and  <dig> displaying broader immunogenicity than o35e . four of seven donor saliva contained anti-m <dig> iga against strain  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. one donor displayed anti-m <dig> iga for all three strains. omp of the m <dig> mutants were used as negative controls . these data suggest that m. catarrhalis expresses m <dig> in vivo and that the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue recognizes m <dig> as an antigen.

aminopenicillin susceptibility is mediated by m35
one of the major bacterial strategies for drug resistance is barrier protection, which limits the intracellular access of antimicrobial agents  <cit> . the influx of large, charged molecules is controlled by porins, which allow passive penetration of hydrophilic molecules of several classes of antibiotics  <cit> . thus, porin-mediated om permeability is expected to affect susceptibility to antimicrobial agents  <cit> . to investigate this, e-tests were performed with the mutants o35e.m <dig>   <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig> and their respective wild-type parent strains. there were no differences in mic for penicillin g, ceftriaxone, meropenem, erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, and vancomycin between wild-type and mutant strains, respectively. for quinolones , cefuroxime and imipenem there was a minor, but consistent ~ <dig> -fold increase in the mic of the mutants . for ampicillin and amoxicillin, however, there was a statistically significant increase in the mic of the mutants  in comparison with their respective wild-types  . interestingly, at an approximately 10-fold lower level, this was also found for amoxicillin-clavulanate .

expression of m <dig> and putative virulence traits of m. catarrhalis
the capacity to autoagglutinate is mediated by hemagglutinin   <cit> , but some hemagglutinin knock-out mutants still autoagglutinate . thus, we investigated whether the absence of m <dig> affected autoagglutination, but failed to identify any difference between strain o35e and o35e.m <dig> . similarly, resistance of m. catarrhalis to human complement, which is associated with disease-causing isolates  <cit>  and which requires expression of several omp  <cit> , was not impaired by the lack of m <dig> . growth of m. catarrhalis in vivo is dependent on the ability to acquire iron from the human host by retrieving fe3+ from iron-containing host proteins by a number of specific binding and uptake systems  <cit> . because of its abundance on mucosal surfaces, we chose to investigate the ability of the m <dig> mutant to use iron bound to human lactoferrin using a standard disk feeding assay on iron depleted bhi agar plates  <cit> . the experiment resulted in no differences in growth between the three m <dig> mutants and their respective wild-type parents .

adherence and invasion of the m <dig> mutant
the abilities of a pathogen to adhere to and invade epithelial host cells, respectively, are major virulence factors. adhesins and invasins usually are omp  <cit> , some of which also act as porins  <cit> . to investigate if m <dig> mediates adherence and invasion assays were performed on chang conjunctival cells as well as on a <dig> lung cells. adherence of the o35e.m <dig> mutant was as efficient as that of its wild-type parent strain . similarly, no differences were found for the capacity to invade these cell types  in gentamicin protection assays.

proinflammatory activity of m <dig> on human monocytes
proinflammatory activity is typically induced by omp, lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acids. porins have also been described to induce proinflammatory cascades by activating innate immune receptors mediating the expression of several chemokines and cytokines  <cit> . we investigated m <dig> with regard to its proinflammatory effect on human monocytes. thp- <dig> cells were stimulated with strain o35e or its o35e.m <dig> mutant overnight and cytokine release in the supernatant was measured by determining the concentrations of il- <dig> and tnfα by elisa. there was no difference in the release of il- <dig> and tnfα, respectively, between wild-type and mutant .

m <dig> sequence analysis of type  <dig> strain 287
m <dig> is nearly 100% conserved among type  <dig> strains of m. catarrhalis  <cit> . to determine if this is also true for the other major phylogenetic subpopulations of m. catarrhalis, m <dig> of type  <dig> strain  <dig> was sequenced and analyzed by bioinformatics. in comparison with type  <dig> strain o35e, there was a divergence of  <dig> % at the dna level consisting mainly of point mutations . unexpectedly, these dna mutations lead to an even greater divergence of  <dig> % at the amino acid sequence level . this corresponds to a substantial number of missense mutations.

discussion
porins are essential components of the gram-negative outer membrane and contribute to nutrient transport, antimicrobial resistance, response to osmostress and other processes, which are essential for bacterial homeostasis. m <dig> is the first functionally characterized om porin of m. catarrhalis  <cit>  and as of today all isolates examined carry a highly conserved m <dig> gene on their chromosome. this may indicate that strains not expressing m <dig> are not viable in vivo, but the only evidence in support of this hypothesis is the observation that a m <dig> mutant was unable to colonize the nasal mucosa of mice  <cit> , which are not a natural host species for m. catarrhalis.

our observation that healthy humans have mucosal iga directed against m <dig> indicates that this protein is expressed in vivo. however, the fact that some salivary samples did not recognize all three m <dig> proteins tested suggests that either  antigenic variation occurs at immunoreactive, surface exposed epitopes, or  it is a weak antigen and some individuals lose or never acquire anti-m <dig> iga, or  some isolates lack expression of m <dig> in vivo. if the latter were the case, screening of large collections of clinical m. catarrhalis isolates should identify strains either lacking a m <dig> gene or isolates carrying silent genes. the answer to this question is of clinical relevance, because our data indicate that the absence of m <dig> is a previously unknown mechanism of aminopenicillin resistance in m. catarrhalis. this effect could occur in vivo by alterations in porin expression to prevent antibiotic influx, which is a well known mechanism of resistance in other pathogens  <cit> , and which often is associated with the expression of degradative enzymes to confer high level resistance  <cit> . the specificity of m <dig> for aminopenicillins could be explained by an effect bezrukov et al described for ompf of e. coli. they found that the nature and position of specific charges on both the antibiotic molecule and the porin play a major role in these interactions  <cit> . strong binding to the pore correlates with high diffusion rates whereas weak binding is associated with reduced diffusion. as of today, the only known mechanism of aminopenicillin resistance in m. catarrhalis is the expression of one of three chromosomally encoded bro betalactamases, which are detectable in greater than 90% of clinical isolates  <cit>  and explain the fact that the mic for amoxicillin-clavulanate in our experiments was at least 10-fold lower than the mic for amoxicillin. this finding indicates that clavulanate penetrates the om by ways other than m <dig>  it also demonstrates that, in the presence of clavulanate, the reduced amount of aminopenicillins still penetrating the om in m <dig> mutants suffices to inhibit growth. thus, it appears that clavulanate inhibits essentially all betalactamase activity available and that naturally occurring isolates lacking m <dig> would not currently pose a substantial therapeutic problem in patients treated with betalactamase-resistant betalactams. however, standard dose or high dose amoxicillin still is the therapeutic standard for antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media. based on our data , currently accepted pharmakinetic/pharmcodynamic  breakpoints for resistance against standard dose  or high dose amoxicillin , respectively,  <cit>  thus predict that isolates lacking functional m <dig> may display clinically relevant aminopenicillin resistance. this is particularly relevant for the treatment of acute otitis media. drug concentrations reached in the middle ear cavity are low in comparison with serum concentrations  <cit>  and treatment failure is typically caused by insufficient drug concentrations in the middle ear fluid  <cit> . the list of betalactam antibiotics tested in this study is not exhaustive and it is conceivable that other drugs may also be affected by m <dig> mutations. thus, further studies are needed to explore the potential impact of m <dig> mutants on antimicrobial treatment failures.

multiple phenotypic tests that we carried out with three wild-type/mutant pairs failed to uncover an additional functions attributable to m <dig>  none of these results is particularly surprising. the strength of these "negative" data lies precisely in the fact that we did not study one, but three different isolates and their respective mutants, which, taken together, provide firm evidence that m <dig> is not involved these various phenotypes in vitro. the analysis of three different wild-type/mutant pairs also lead to the conclusion that knocking-out m <dig> does not necessarily upregulate expression of a  <dig> kda omp as stated by easton et al . because these authors used a different strain, it is conceivable that they observed a strain-specific phenomenon, which does not represent the entire species. finally, we sequenced m <dig> of a strain belonging to the phylogenetically old, second subpopulation of m. catarrhalis  <cit> , which differs from the younger subpopulation by a considerably larger genetic diversity  <cit> . indeed, we found a substantial number of sequence deviations, which, interestingly, were even greater at the amino acid level than at the dna level. it is thus conceivable that type  <dig> strains exhibit functional and/or antigenic differences with respect to m <dig>  which warrant further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the significant increases in mic for ampicillin and amoxicillin of the m <dig> mutants indicate that the om porin m <dig> is involved in the uptake of aminopenicillins. this is a previously unknown mechanism of resistance in m. catarrhalis. it remains to be elucidated whether naturally occurring, disease causing strains of m. catarrhalis devoid of functional m <dig> exist, and whether they may contribute to clinical treatment failure. the fact that normal human saliva contains anti-iga indicates that m <dig> is expressed in vivo, but that antigenic variation may be greater than previously appreciated. thus, further studies are needed before m <dig> can be considered a potential vaccine candidate against m. catarrhalis.
