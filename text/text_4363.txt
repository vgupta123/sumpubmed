BACKGROUND
fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  belongs to a receptor tyrosine kinase family which is comprised of four members, fgfr1- <dig>  the fgfr protein structure is composed of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain  <cit> . the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains are the primary binding sites for ligands, fibroblast growth factors , and heparin  <cit> . there are  <dig> known fgfs that bind to the fgfrs to control the balance among migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of a wide variety of cells  <cit> . normally, mesenchymal ligands fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> activate the fgfr <dig> iiib isoform, whereas epithelial fgfs - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> activate the fgfr <dig> iiic isoform  <cit> .

fgf binding to fgfr stimulates receptor dimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of signal transduction pathways. activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases  p <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  pi <dig> kinase-akt pathway, plcÎ³ pathway and other pathways vary depending on the cell type  <cit> . p <dig> as well as erk1/ <dig> play an important role in osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . raucci showed that akt activation correlates with osteoblast differentiation. erk1/ <dig> and akt have distinct effects in fgf-induced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. erk1/ <dig> is a primary mediator of fgf-induced proliferation and differentiation, while akt is important for osteoblast survival  <cit> . it was also found that the pkc pathway mediates proliferation, differentiation, as well as cell-cell adhesion among osteoblasts  <cit> .

ossification of the majority of neurocranial sutures is an intramembranous process. the two major midline sutures in mice are the interfrontal  between the frontal bones and the sagittal between the parietal bones. the two major transverse sutures include the coronal sutures between the frontal and parietal bones and the lambdoid sutures between the parietal and the interparietal  bones. these sutures have different tissue origins because the frontal bones are neural crest-derived and the parietal bones are mesoderm-derived with a tongue of neural crest between the two parietal bones  <cit> . the normal growth and morphogenesis of calvarial sutures is dependent upon a balance between proliferation of osteogenic precursors within the sutural mesenchyme and differentiation to osteoblasts at the osteogenic fronts  <cit> .

ossification of most of the cranial base and the long bones is an endochondral process. mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes to form a cartilaginous template, which is replaced by osteoblast differentiation and bone formation  <cit> . the mouse cranial base consists of several bones including the presphenoid, basisphenoid, basioccipital, the ethmoid and the tympanic bullae of the temporal bones. the basioccipital and petrous portion of the temporal bones lack a neural crest contribution and are derived from mesoderm  <cit> . during both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, fgf/fgfr signaling regulates cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> .

in humans, apert syndrome is caused by gain of function mutations of fgfr <dig>  apert syndrome  is a congenital condition characterized by craniosynostosis involving the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, midfacial hypoplasia and syndactyly of hands and feet. among the calvarial sutures affected in the apert syndrome patients, the coronal suture is most commonly involved  <cit> . almost all cases of apert syndrome are due to one of two mutations, each an amino acid substitution in adjacent residues, ser252trp  and pro253arg  of fgfr <dig>  <cit> . both mutations affect the highly conserved linker region between the immunoglobulin-like ii and iii domains and result in increased affinity and altered specificity of fgf ligand binding  <cit> . in vivo and in vitro studies of fetal and postnatal sutural cells from apert patients with craniosynostosis and either mutation demonstrated perturbations of proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis  <cit> .

two mouse models of apert syndrome containing the fgfr <dig> +/s252w mutation, one outbred  <cit>  and one inbred  <cit> , and one outbred mouse model containing the fgfr2+/p253r mutation  <cit>  have been reported. these mutant mice showed skull malformations with premature closure of sutures associated with abnormal osteogenic proliferation, differentiation and/or cell apoptosis. their skull base and long bones showed growth retardation with abnormal proliferating and/or hypertrophic zone. the fgf/fgfr <dig> signaling pathway was studied in the outbred apert mouse models  <cit> . shukla et al. showed that phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> was higher in lung, thymus, kidney and liver in fgfr2+/s252w mice compared to wild-type controls, but the craniofacial tissues were not examined  <cit> . holmes et al. found increased phosphorylation of akt and p <dig> in newborn fgfr2+/s252w calvarial tissues and/or immortalized cells  <cit> . in fgfr2+/p253r mice, yin et al. checked signaling by cell culture in bone marrow cells derived from femoral bones with endochondral ossification, and found enhanced expression levels of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  but no signaling data are reported for the neurocranium in this mouse  <cit> .

to identify the skeletal malformations and related intracellular signaling caused by the fgfr <dig> +/p253r mutation, we studied the molecular signaling in the skull of our independently generated, inbred fgfr2+/p253r mouse with the same c57bl/6j genetic background as our previously reported fgfr2+/s252w mouse  <cit> . the production of the inbred fgfr2+/p253r mouse enables direct comparison between models carrying dissimilar fgfr <dig> mutations but on similar backgrounds without the confounding influence of uncommon background genes. gross and histological abnormalities of the neurocranium, skull base and long bones were analyzed in our fgfr2+/p253r mice and found to be similar to those of our fgfr2+/s252w mutant mice. furthermore we found the activation of p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> signaling occurred in the neurocranium of the fgfr2+/p253r mouse.

RESULTS
generation and characterization of fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice
we designed a gene targeting construct to site-specifically knock-in the fgfr <dig> 758c>g mutation  into the mouse genome by homologous recombination . southern blot hybridization, pcr, and sequencing confirmed the predicted mutant allele. an inbred line was generated by mating our heterozygote fgfr2+/p253rneo mice with c57bl/6j mice for more than ten generations. the inserted neo cassette was found by rt-pcr to decrease dramatically the expression of the mutant allele . we then excised the floxed neo cassette by mating heterozygote fgfr2+/p253rneo mice with eiia-cre transgenic mice that were also generated on a b <dig> genetic background. heterozygous fgfr2+/p253r mice were born at the expected frequency of 50%, and their mutant and wild-type alleles resulted in similar fgfr <dig> mrna and protein expression levels . the fgfr <dig> p253r allele was expressed in multiple organs including the skull, limb, and other tissues .

at postnatal stages p <dig> and p <dig> the mutants could be distinguished from their littermate controls by their domed shaped head, which had a decreased anteroposterior  length . the body size and weight of the mutants were similar to the controls at p <dig> . however, with age the mutants had poor growth and became increasingly different from their littermate controls . the body weight of mutants became significantly less than that of control littermates with increasing age . almost half of the fgfr2+/p253r mutants died within 24- <dig> hours after birth; most died within  <dig> weeks of age , and very few survived to  <dig> weeks.

skeletal abnormalities in fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice
necropsy of p <dig> fgfr2+/p253r mice revealed multiple malformations of the skeleton system including skull, palate, sternum, and long bones . at p <dig>  the fgfr2+/p253r skull was consistently smaller than that of littermate controls  and the coronal suture was often prematurely fused at p <dig> . from e <dig>  until p <dig>  all mutants  exhibited bilateral incomplete fusion at the junction of the primary and secondary palatal shelves . all mutants at p <dig> had abnormal bony fusion of the sternum . at p <dig>  the lengths of the humerus, radius, femur, and tibia were similar between mutant and wild-type, but later at p <dig>  they became relatively shorter in the mutant .

craniofacial skeletal abnormalities in fgfr2+/p253r mice compared to those of fgfr2+/s252w mice
we obtained high resolution micro-ct  scans of skulls from our inbred fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice and their littermate controls at p <dig>  the 3d coordinates of specific craniofacial landmarks http://www.getahead.psu.edu/landmarknewversion/p0mouseskull_updated_applet.html were recorded and used in euclidean distance matrix analysis of landmark data. we tested for morphological differences of specific craniofacial features in each mutant group as compared to its littermate controls and we tested for differences in the magnitude of mutant to control contrasts between the two mouse models for apert syndrome. statistical significance of the differences was determined by using nonparametric confidence intervals  <cit> .

our statistical analyses showed that both fgfr <dig> mutations caused similar craniofacial effects at p <dig> . both fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w skulls were significantly smaller than those of wild-type littermates as measured along the rostro-caudal axis  and the mediolateral axis at the zygomatic process of the temporal bones . the skull lengths, measured from the most anterior aspect of the muzzle to points on the occipital bone at the caudal end of the skull, were reduced by 4-5% in both models . intercanthal distances were reduced by 4-5% in both mutant mice. skulls of mutant and wild-type mice did not differ significantly in width at more posterior locations on the neurocranium, specifically the distance between the left and right squamosal bones. skull height was increased relative to littermate controls by 3-4% in both mutants .

other localized measurements showed significant differences in the effects of the fgfr <dig> +/p253r and +/s252w mutations . the maxilla was more reduced relative to the mandible in both mutant mice, but the fgfr2+/p253r mice showed significantly less reduction in the maxilla compared to fgfr2+/s252w mice. the fgfr2+/p253r maxilla was reduced by 10%  and the fgfr2+/s252w maxilla was reduced by 13%. the mandibles of both mutant mice were reduced relative to littermate controls by approximately 5%. total palatal length of the fgfr2+/p253r mice was reduced by 4% relative to littermate controls , whereas it was reduced by 8% in fgfr2+/s252w mice. the more posterior portion of the palate  was not obviously affected in the fgfr2+/p253r mouse, but was reduced by 7% in the fgfr2+/s252w model when compared to controls.

in contrast, the length of nasal region in fgfr2+/p253r mice was significantly reduced by 10%, while it was reduced by 4% in fgfr2+/s252w mice relative to littermate controls. the nasal reduction in fgfr2+/p253r mice was consistent with observations by yin et al.  <cit> . furthermore, the fgfr2+/p253r mice were significantly different from their littermate controls for the anterior and overall length of the cranial base; whereas the fgfr2+/s252w mice were not significantly different from their controls in the overall, anterior or posterior cranial base lengths . when directly comparing the fgfr2+/p253r to the fgfr2+/s252w mice, only the anterior cranial base length was significantly different. we did not observe premature fusion of the intrasphenoidal and spheno-occipital synchondroses in either mutant at p <dig> 

hrct images revealed similar patterns of calvarial suture fusion in fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice. coronal synostosis was present in most p <dig> mutant mice, whereas these sutures were patent in littermate controls . both mutant mice revealed premature closure of the suture between the zygomatic process of the maxilla and the zygomatic bones, and the premaxillary-maxillary sutures . in contrast, the inter-premaxillary suture appeared patent in mutant mice, while it was closed in controls , an observation consistent with our gross and histological findings of these mutants. the midline suture between the horizontal plates of the palatine bones was patent in all mutant mice in both models while it was closed in some of their respective controls. the suture between the horizontal plate of the palatine bone and the palatal shelf of the maxilla was patent in nine of the ten fgfr2+/p253r mice and in three of the seven littermate controls. this ratio of patent to closed sutures in the mutant and controls were different for the fgfr2+/s252w mice, which had only one patent in eight mutants and in seven of the twelve littermate controls .

* the observation of "closed" varies from simple bridging across the suture to complete closure. closure can be unilateral or bilateral. because these are p <dig> mice, it should be recognized that suture closure is a dynamic process and will vary given the age of the mice observed.

neurocranial sutural dysmorphology in fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice
sutures were examined microscopically to further characterize the abnormalities observed in the mutant skulls at different developmental stages. coronal sutures exhibited presynostosis or synostosis at p <dig>  similar to the fgfr2+/s252w mice  <cit> . we analyzed the coronal suture in detail because synostosis of this suture is most characteristic of human apert syndrome. in the fgfr2+/p253r coronal sutures at p <dig>  there was presynostosis defined here as a more proximate location of the osteogenic fronts with disorganized cellularity and the initiation of osteoid deposition. in the littermate controls, the osteogenic fronts were well organized with a clear separation between the frontal and parietal bones . by the later stages p <dig>  and p <dig> , the osteogenic fronts in the mutants fused together with the formation of osteoid, but the fronts still were separated in the controls. the transverse lambdoid and midline sagittal sutures in mutants at p <dig> also showed proximate osteogenic fronts with increased cellularity and osteoid deposition, while the controls had separated osteogenic fronts . also similar to what we reported in fgfr2+/s252w mice  <cit> , there was ectopic cartilage at the sagittal suture in fgfr2+/p253r mice from e <dig>  to p <dig> . in all mutants, but only in two of the  <dig> controls at p <dig>  cartilage was observed at the junction between the parietal and interparietal bone.

abnormal osteoblastic proliferation, differentiation and no increased apoptosis at the coronal sutures in fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice
the effects of the fgfr <dig> +/p253r mutation on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were investigated at the coronal suture from e <dig>  to p <dig> as the involvement of these processes varied during development. cell proliferation was analyzed by calculating the ratios of the number of brdu positive cells to total cells between and including the osteogenic fronts in mutants and littermate controls. at e <dig>  the ratio was obviously decreased in mutants as compared to controls  . while at later stages e <dig>  and p <dig> , there was no difference in the proliferation between the mutants and controls .

differentiation local to the coronal suture was studied from e <dig>  to p <dig> by using alkaline phosphatase , runx <dig>  osteopontin, osteonectin, collagen type i, and osteocalcin markers. apparent differences in the expression of these markers were found between mutants and controls. in controls, the coronal suture was present as a layer of undifferentiated cells without alp expression located between the frontal and parietal bones; whereas in mutants, this layer exhibited a cellular disorganization with expanded and broader alp expression . there was also increased staining of runx <dig> in mutant coronal sutures compared to wild-type . enhanced expression of early osteoblast markers alp and runx <dig> demonstrated increased osteoblast differentiation along the overlapping osteogenic fronts of fgfr2+/p253r mice compared with littermate controls. in addition, late osteogenic markers including osteonectin showed a similar expression pattern in both mutant and wild-type in cells flanking the developing bone of the sutures. however in the mutant, bone growth progressed further with more overlap of the frontal and parietal bones . these results indicated increased osteogenic differentiation as well as accelerated bone growth in fgfr2+/p253r mice sutures. apoptosis at the coronal suture was studied by tunel staining. there was no apparent difference in apoptosis between mutants and controls at e <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig> .

brdu, osteogenic markers and tunel staining were also performed on the coronal suture of the fgfr2+/s252w mice from e <dig>  to p <dig> and yielded similar results to those found for the fgfr2+/p253r mice. the ratio of brdu positive cells to total cells were significantly decreased in fgfr2+/s252w mice compared to wild-type littermates  . osteogenic markers showed increased differentiation and accelerated bone formation . there was no apparent difference in apoptosis between fgfr2+/s252w mice and controls at p <dig> .

limb shortening with abnormal osteogenic differentiation in fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice
the forelimbs and hindlimbs showed decreased postnatal growth in the fgfr2+/p253r mice as compared to littermate controls. by p <dig>  the lengths of the limbs of mutants were significantly smaller, but relatively proportional as compared to controls . for the humerus and femur, the lengths of the mutants were  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  mm, while that of the controls were  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  mm, respectively . for the radius or ulna and tibia or fibula, the lengths of the mutants were  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  mm, while those of the controls were  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  mm, respectively . the ratios of the humerus to the radius or ulna  as well as the ratios of the femur to the tibia or fibula  were not significantly different . none of the mutants exhibited syndactyly . our previous report of fgfr2+/s252w mice also showed that although the mutant mice were smaller than control littermates, the forelimb and hindlimb lengths were proportional in mutant and no syndactyly was detected  <cit> .

from e <dig>  to later stages such as p <dig>  histopathology of the long bones revealed mild abnormalities at the physis with the hypertrophic zone most affected as it appeared disorganized in fgfr2+/p253r mice . increased numbers of brdu positive cells at the chondro-osseous junction and the metaphysis revealed abnormal osteoblast proliferation . in situ hybridization of osteogenic markers showed increased expression in preosteoblasts or osteoblasts in the same region, suggesting increased osteoblast differentiation . for fgfr2+/s252w mice we obtained similar results . because the abnormalities of the limbs were less striking than those of the skull, we focused our further molecular studies on the skull.

abnormal molecular signaling in the skull of fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice
to investigate the molecular basis or signaling of the abnormal proliferation and differentiation observed in the skulls of fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice at e <dig> , we checked the phosphorylated and total protein levels of mapk erk1/ <dig>  p <dig>  pkcÎ± and akt in tissues isolated from the neurocranium and cranial base of embryos from at least  <dig> litters by western blot analysis. the phosphorylated and total protein expression levels were normalized to Î²-actin levels, then the relative ratio of phosphorylated protein/total protein  between the mutant and wild-type control was calculated for the above markers. although there was in vivo variation in the level of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases  in the neurocranium of inbred fgfr2+/p253r embryos, the results showed that the median phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> levels were increased, but by less than  <dig>  fold . these map kinases were slightly increased in the cranial base of the fgfr2+/p253r mutants based on the median value, but some individuals showed evident increase . phosphorylated pkcÎ± and akt protein levels did not show an obvious increase in either the neurocranium and skull base of fgfr2+/p253r mice as compared to wild-type controls . these results indicate that the fgfr <dig> +/p253r mutation contributes to the activation of p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> pathways in the skull.

discussion
similarities of the craniofacial phenotype of mice with fgfr <dig> p253r and s252w mutations
mice carrying the heterozygous p253r mutation in the fgfr <dig> gene, and the heterozygous s252w mutant mice that we reported previously  <cit> , serve as models for apert syndrome as their phenotypes, especially the skeletal defects, are similar to the human condition. we compared the two mutant inbred mice on the same genetic background so that their phenotypes might more clearly exhibit the differential effects of the mutations without the added variation produced by varying backgrounds. standard cellular and molecular techniques have been combined with precise 3d measures of craniofacial anatomy captured by hrct to provide nonparametric statistical evaluation and qualitative comparisons of various aspects of the two models.

all surviving fgfr2+/p253r mice were small in size at postnatal stages and had anomalies including abnormal domed-shaped skulls with decreased rostro-caudal length, increased height, and craniosynostosis. synostosis of the coronal suture was commonly present in the mutant mice. these phenotypic features were in agreement with those in previously reported fgfr2+/p253r mice that were outbred and generated from tc <dig> es cells  <cit> , which had a genetic background different from the r <dig> es cells used to create the mice reported here. in our fgfr2+/p253r mice, we noted additional abnormalities in the neurocranium with premature fusions of zygomatic process of the maxilla and the zygomatic bones, and fusion of the premaxillary-maxillary sutures. the inter-premaxillary suture, on the other hand, was patent at p <dig> in mutants and closed in the majority of wild-type mice. this may indicate a localized delay in the fusion of some sutures in fgfr2+/p253r mice. similar results were obtained for our fgfr2+/s252w mice  <cit> .

the fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice showed most of the characteristic skull features associated with apert syndrome . for example, the coronal suture closure, as presented in these mice, is the most common skeletal phenotype in apert syndrome patients  <cit> . furthermore, similar to humans with apert syndrome  <cit> , the skulls of fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice are typically brachycephalic, relatively short along the anteroposterior axis and relatively wide. in addition, the midfacial retrusion and maxillary hypoplasia described in humans with apert syndrome <cit>  also occurs in apert mice as measured by statistically significant reductions in all facial and palatal distances in the mutant mice relative to their littermate controls. early fusion of the zygomatic-maxillary and the premaxilla-maxillary sutures most likely contributes to the midfacial retrusion.

differences in the craniofacial phenotype of mice with fgfr <dig> p253r and s252w mutations
although the craniofacial phenotypes of the fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice are generally similar, there were differences in the craniofacial region between our sample of fgfr2+/p253r and the fgfr2+/s252w mice. fgfr2+/p253r mutant mice had less reduction of the maxilla and therefore demonstrated less midface hypoplasia and mandibular prognathism relative to fgfr2+/s252w mutant mice. the fgfr2+/p253r mice also showed 50% less reduction of the total palate length compared to the affected palates of fgfr2+/s252w mice. further the suture between the horizontal plate of the palatine bone and the palatal shelf of the maxilla was patent in most of the fgfr2+/p253r mice and in at least half of the controls, but was prematurely fused in most of the fgfr2+/s252w mice.

these results are generally consistent with human studies showing differences that have been characterized as less severe craniofacial features in patients with the +/p253r mutation than in patients with the +/s252w mutation  <cit> . slaney et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> unrelated apert syndrome patients with  <dig> having the p253r mutation and  <dig> with the s252w mutation and found that cleft palates were significantly less common in patients with the former mutation. they also quantified the severity of the craniofacial phenotype including maxillary hypoplasia by using a five-point preoperative severity score. the mean score was higher for the heterozygous s252w group than for the p253r group, although this difference was not significant. yet, they found that all three very mildly affected patients had the p253r mutation, whereas the two most severely affected patients both had the s252w mutation. von gernet et al.  <cit>  studied  <dig> patients, six with the p253r mutation and  <dig> with the s252w mutation. the craniofacial appearance of their patients with the dominant p253r mutation following surgery was better than those with the s252w mutations who had more pronounced midfacial and dental findings. park et al.  <cit>  reported on  <dig> patients, nine with the p253r mutation and  <dig> with the s252w mutation, and showed that the cleft palates were less common among patient with the p253r mutation, but no statistical significance was demonstrated for other craniofacial features. the consistency of the craniofacial phenotypic differences between these two mutations in humans and mice suggest that the functional effects of the two mutations are indeed different. however, further morphological studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.

importantly, we found a few features including the lengths of nasal region and the anterior cranial base that were significantly more affected in the fgfr2+/p253r as compared to fgfr2+/s252w mice. in a few cases of patients with apert syndrome, the nasal and cranial base lengths were also noted to be reduced in radiographs, but their mutations were not analyzed  <cit> . these results indicate that each mutation has differential effects on certain anatomical structures resulting in varying localized phenotypic differences between the two mouse mutants rather than one mutation causing generally more severe phenotypes. differences in the maxilla, palate, nasal region, and anterior cranial base between the two mutant mice may be due to specific tissue origins or localized variations in expression of fgf/fgfrs with autocrine signaling, their differential binding to their receptors and activation.

abnormal osteogenesis at the calvarial sutures and long bones in fgfr <dig> p253r and s252w mice
previous studies of human calvaria suggested abnormal proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts causes the apert syndrome phenotype  <cit> . some of these studies focused on postnatal suture samples from apert syndrome patients with the p253r mutation. fragale et al.  <cit>  observed that mutant osteoblasts had a lower proliferation rate, high alkaline phosphatase activity, increased mineralization and expression of noncollagenous matrix proteins. baroni et al.  <cit>  found abnormal differentiation with osteocalcin mrna down-regulated and fgf <dig> secretion increased. other studies were performed from cells derived from patients with the s252w mutation. lomri et al.  <cit>  showed normal cell proliferation and increased differentiation with elevated expression of alkaline phosphatase and type  <dig> collagen in calvaria cells derived from apert infants and fetuses. abnormal apoptosis has also been found in human osteoblasts with the fgfr <dig> s252w mutation  <cit> . premature apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes was found in the mutant compared to normal fetal suture of a  <dig> week fetus. some of these findings are not consistent perhaps because of differences of culture conditions and difficulty in obtaining appropriate human samples from early embryonic studies.

in our in vivo mouse models, we observed consistent presynostosis or synostosis of the coronal sutures during development in both our fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice . we found decreased proliferation, increased osteoblastic differentiation, accelerated bone formation and no obvious difference in apoptosis in mutant coronal sutures at late embryonic stages as compared to controls. at the osteogenic fronts, there are different cell types which perform different processes, our results showed that at the coronal suture, the numbers of brdu labeled, proliferating cells are decreased, whereas the preosteoblasts marked by alp and runx <dig> staining are increased in the mutants, indicating the shift towards more advanced osteoblast differentiation and imbalance between proliferation and differentiation at e <dig>  in the fgfr2p253r/+ suture. chen et al.  <cit>  and holmes et al.  <cit>  studied the coronal suture in the same fgfr2+/s252w mice model  <cit> . chen observed increased apoptosis from p <dig> to p <dig>  postnatal stages. because no significant changes in proliferation and differentiation were detected from e <dig>  to p <dig>  they suggested that the increased cell death/apoptosis might account for the premature fusion of the coronal sutures in the fgfr2+/s252w mice  <cit> . holmes reassessed coronal suture fusion in the same mouse model, they found that at e <dig>  apoptotic cells appeared in the mutant coronal sutures, but were strictly limited to sites of osteoid contact between the frontal and parietal bones, but above this area they saw decreased proliferation in a more extended region. they suggested that apoptosis appeared to be a consequence rather than a cause of sutural fusion in fgfrs252w/+ mice. earlier at e <dig>  they also examined the proliferation, and found a modest increase in the coronal suture. from e <dig>  to e <dig>  ectopic proliferation was observed in the basal area of the coronal suture, but not in the osteogenic fronts above this. they further found that, as fusion continues in the fgfr2s252w/+ osteogenic fronts in the more apical area of the suture at e <dig> , there is a significant decrease in proliferation possibly secondary to greater osteoblast maturation  <cit> . yin et al.  <cit>  studied the coronal suture in their fgfr2+/p253r mice. they showed increased osteoblast differentiation at late embryonic stages e <dig>  and  <dig> , but cell proliferation and apoptosis were not examined  <cit> .

we suggest, by combining our findings and those in the literature, that abnormal proliferation and differentiation in the coronal suture occurs primarily during the early embryonic stages and is followed by apoptosis at late embryonic and postnatal stages in both mutants, although there can be in vivo variation. we also found that long bone development was affected by abnormal osteogenesis at late embryonic stages in our two mouse models. yin et al.  <cit>  and our group  <cit>  had observed abnormal chondrogenesis in the skeleton of fgfr2+/p253r and fgfr2+/s252w mice, respectively. we conclude that during prenatal stages, abnormal proliferation and increased differentiation of mesenchyme and the osteoblast/chondrocyte lineages in the developing coronal suture and limb are important in the mechanism leading to postnatal synostosis at sutures with apoptosis and to shortening of the limbs.

our previously published study of fgfr2+/s252w mice focused on the midline interfrontal defect and sagittal sutures from e <dig>  to p <dig>  <cit> . we found increased proliferating cells and abnormal expression of the osteogenic markers. we did not find an obvious midline interfrontal defect in the fgfr2+/p253r mice at p <dig> as indicated by examination of micro-ct scan and histology, but yin et al.  <cit>  found a patent posterior frontal suture at p <dig>  it is possible that this defect becomes more apparent with age or different genetic backgrounds. we found increased or abnormal cartilage formation in the mutant sagittal suture in our fgfr2+/p253r mice, as did yin et al. for their fgfr2+/p253r mice  <cit>  and in our fgfr2+/s252w mice  <cit> . these observations further support the fact that both fgfr <dig> +/p253r and +/s252w mutations affect chondrogenesis in apert syndrome  <cit> . also notable is the dissimilarity in the pathogenesis between the developing mutant midline and coronal sutures, which may in part be caused by alterations in ligand availability and signaling pathways involved local to specific sutures of different tissue origin.

molecular studies using apert mouse models  <cit>  found enhanced expression levels of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> in visceral tissues and increased level of phosphorylated akt and p <dig> in calvarial tissues of fgfr2+/s252w mice. in fgfr2+/p253r mice, erk1/ <dig> was the only activated pathway reported in the bone marrow cell cultures from long bones. given that calvarial sutures and the cranial base have different bone ossification processes of intramembranous or endochondral bone formation, respectively, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the neurocranium and base and compared these results with those published for the bone marrow cells of the long bones from the fgfr2+/p253r mice. our studies showed increased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> in the skull, particularly in the neurocranium of the fgfr2+/p253r mice. these results indicate that in both intramembranous and endochondral bone ossification in apert syndrome, the activation of mapk pathways, in particular p <dig>  may play an important role in the abnormal proliferation and differentiation in craniosynostosis of fgfr2+/p253r mice. yin et al.  <cit>  revealed that inhibition of erk1/ <dig> activity partly prevented the premature closure of coronal sutures and recovered the retarded endochondral ossification of cultured mutant femurs. they speculated that some other pathways may also be involved in the pathogenesis of the skeleton phenotypes resulting from the fgfr <dig> mutation. based on the consistent finding of activation of the p <dig> pathway in calvarial tissues of our fgfr2+/p253r mice and in fgfr2+/s252w mice <cit> , we propose that the p <dig>  as well as erk1/ <dig> pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of skeletal abnormalities induced by the fgfr <dig> p253r mutation.

insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis models
the cellular mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis have been investigated using other mouse models  <cit> . for example, there are transgenic mice with different mutations including twist1+/-  <cit> , fgfr1p250r/+  <cit> , fgfr2-iiic+/Î  <cit> , fgfr2c342y/+  <cit> , fgfr2+/s252w  <cit> , fgfr2+/p253r  <cit> , axin2-/-  <cit> , fgfr3p244r  <cit> ; and epha4-/- mice  <cit> . analysis of these mice has contributed insights into cranial suture biology and mechanisms of craniosynostosis. fgf/fgfr signaling has an important role in normal suture development and craniosynostosis  <cit> . twist <dig> mutant mice exhibit coronal synostosis and mimic features of saethre-chotzen syndrome  <cit> . it has been shown that twist <dig> regulates levels of fgfr <dig> expression and phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> activity in sutures at late embryonic and postnatal stages of mice  <cit> . ephrin-eph signaling has important function in boundary formation and the pathogenesis of coronal synostosis  <cit> . epha <dig>  a receptor for ephrin-a <dig> and ephrin-a <dig> ligands, was detected on the ectocranial side of the prospective frontal bone  <cit> . epha4-/- mice present defects in the coronal suture and neural crest-mesoderm boundary that phenocopy those of twist1+/- mice. it has been shown that epha <dig> is a twist <dig> effector in coronal suture development  <cit> . as downstream molecular signals of twist <dig>  both fgfr <dig> and epha <dig> function through the rtk pathways to cause synostosis  <cit> . this may explain why fgfr <dig> +/p253r mice in our study and epha <dig> mutant mice in the study of ting et al.  <cit> , both exhibit enhanced expression of the early osteoblast markers alp and runx <dig> within the synostosed suture, as well as altered mapk signaling. we hypothesize that ephrin/eph and fgf/fgfr signaling may converge to a common mechanism involved in the development of craniosynotosis and this hypothesis needs to be further studied.

CONCLUSIONS
there is in vivo variation in phenotypic and molecular findings in apert syndrome resulting from different mutations, as well as possible differences in autocrine fgf signaling, environmental factors and stochastic events. inbred mutant mouse models provide insight into the pathogenesis of this condition. our findings are consistent in both fgfr2+/p253rand fgfr2+/s252w mice for the shortening of skull length, the presence of coronal suture synostosis, and abnormal proliferation and differentiation in the prenatal and newborn coronal suture and long bones. we observed in the fgfr2+/p253r neurocranium an increase in phosphorylated p <dig> as well as erk1/ <dig>  whereas phosphorylated akt and pkcÎ± were not obviously changed as compared to those of wild-type controls. our results suggest a potential application of combined modulators of the map kinases in the treatment of craniosynostosis syndrome.
