BACKGROUND
still affecting millions of people around the world, predominantly in developing countries  <cit> , malaria is one of the most relevant poverty-related infectious tropical diseases. even though prophylactic and therapeutic agents exists, they are not broadly available and affordable for the local populations. measures of vector elimination and control by draining mosquito breeding pools, application of insecticides, and bed nets have not been sufficiently effective in many cases. additionally, increasing resistances of the parasite and the vector against both, chemical control measures and medical treatments are a growing problem  <cit> . therefore, the availability of a vaccine is being regarded as an essential component of a successful malaria eradication strategy  <cit> . despite intense research efforts no vaccine that provides robust sterile protection against malaria is available today. involving two different hosts, mosquito and man, the life cycle of p. falciparum is complex and features three different stages. as summarized in the who rainbow table  <cit> , the majority of proteins used in the context of malaria vaccine candidates today and in the past, are either pre-erythrocytic, or blood stage antigens like pfcsp  <cit> , proteins from the merozoite surface protein family   <cit> , pfama <dig>  <cit>  and other blood stage surface proteins  <cit> . after successful completion of clinical trials gsk’s circumsporozoite protein -based pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine mosquirix®  <cit>  received a positive opinion from ema and is expected to enter the market soon, following who recommendation and clearance by respective national regulators. even though being by far the most advanced malaria vaccine, the impact of mosquirix® is expected to be limited by moderate efficacy  and relatively short-lived protection  <cit> . besides vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite and therefore aiming at the induction of sterile protection by preventing the initial establishment of the infection, there are at least two other types of vaccines. blood stage vaccines could be useful to suppress manifestation of clinical symptoms caused by high parasite load in the blood of the patients, while so called transmission blocking vaccinestarget the sexual stages of the parasite to prevent proliferation in, or trafficking through the mosquito and thereby inhibit the transmission of the parasites from infected to healthy individuals. in the context of malaria eradication efforts and after a recent update of the malaria vaccine technology roadmap in  <dig>  <cit> , transmission-blocking vaccines have recently received elevated attention. the first and most advanced transmission-blocking malaria vaccine candidate is pfs <dig>  a 24 kda post-fertilization macrogamete/zygote surface antigen featuring four epidermal growth factor -like domains  <cit> . it has been shown in different studies that immunization with recombinant pfs <dig> induces antibodies with strong transmission-blocking activity . being exclusively expressed in parasite stages that develop after fertilization within the mosquito and thereby being naturally not exposed to the human immune system the highly conserved pfs <dig> represents an excellent target for vaccine induced transmission-blocking antibody responses. other potentially transmission-blocking vaccine candidates in development are the pre-fertilization gamete/gametocyte antigens pfs <dig> and pfs48/ <dig>  in contrast to pfs <dig> these proteins have been shown to be targets of natural immune responses  <cit>  since they are already expressed on gametocytes that  occur in the human host.

pfgap <dig>  a  <dig>  kda transmembrane protein, forms an essential part of the actin-myosin motor complex driven invasion machinery  associated to the multi-protein complex called inner membrane complex  . detailed investigations on the role of pfgap <dig> during sexual stage development presented by simon et al.  <cit>  indicate that the protein relocates from the imc to the plasma membrane during gametocyte activation and gametocyte egress from erythrocytes triggered by change of temperature, ph and presence of xanthurenic acid encountered within the mosquito midgut after a blood meal. since in this work it has also been shown that pfgap <dig> may protect the gametes from complement-mediated lysis by binding the human complement factor h, the protein can be regarded as novel transmission-blocking candidate.

plant-based transient expression systems are robust, fast and scalable platforms capable of oxidative folding, assembly of multimeric proteins and high level expression  <cit> . several pharmaceutically relevant proteins like monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , therapeutic enzymes  <cit>  as well as antigens, including malaria vaccine candidates  have been produced successfully by transient plant expression. the agrobacterium tumefaciens transient plant expression system offers the chance to compare the efficiency of recombinant protein expression in various subcellular compartments  with different features regarding oxidative folding or post-translational modifications  <cit> .

here, we report the successful plant-based production and characterization of the novel tbv candidate pfgap <dig>  the plastid targeted pfgap <dig> was obtained at high quality by one-step imac purification and used for the immunization of rabbits. the resulting rabbit immune igg preparations were used in different in vitro assays to confirm the induction of antibodies that recognize pfgap <dig> in the native context.

RESULTS
cloning the pfgap <dig> expression constructs
the cdna coding for the extracellular domain of pfgap <dig>  was cloned into the binary plant expression vectors ptrakc-erh and ptrakc-ctph. for the cloning we used cdna encoding amino acids q <dig> to r <dig> featuring the pfgap <dig> without the native n-terminal signal peptide  and without the transmembrane domain to enhance the solubilty of the protein targeted to either the er or plastid. the resulting ptrakc-gap50-erh  construct features sequences for an n-terminal signal peptide , and a c-terminal his6-tag  followed by a sekdel er-retrieval signal . the second expression construct ptrakc-gap50-ctph  provides an n-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide and a c-terminal his6-tag.fig.  <dig> gene ids and plant expression cassettes. a names, accession numbers and amino acid sequence range of pfgap <dig> . b schematic drawing of the expression cassettes in the plant binary expression vector ptrakc . sar: scaffold attachment region; p35ss: cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter with duplicated 35s enhancer region; chs 5ʹ utr: 5ʹ untranslated region of the petroselinum crispum chalcone synthase gene; sp: transit peptide sequence of the murine antibody  <dig> heavy chain  <cit> ; tp: chloroplast targeting signal from small subunit of rubisco from solanum tuberosum; gap50: pfgap50; his6-tag: six histidine tag for imac purification; sekdel: er-retention signal. pa35s: cauliflower mosaic virus 35s polyadenylation signal. relevant restriction sites are indicated



transient expression and purification of pfgap <dig> in n. benthamiana
both expression constructs were used for transient plant expression of pfgap <dig>  the recombinant protein was purified by imac from plant extracts prepared from infiltrated n. benthamiana leaves 5 days post-infiltration . the experiment was repeated independently three times for both constructs and a mock purification using wild type material was carried out once to simplify the identification of potential contaminants. figure 2a and b exemplarily show the sds-page and immunoblot analysis of one experiment per construct . the simple one-step purification procedure using three step elution  yielded pfgap <dig> proteins at different levels of purity and high integrity. as shown in fig. 2a and b, elution at 10 mm imidazole only yielded few host cell proteins , 56 kda) and no detectable pfgap50-erh or pfgap50-ctph , at  <dig> nm we detected host cell proteins at higher abundance as well as detectable amounts of target proteins. the elution fraction e <dig>  in both cases contained the highest amount of pfgap <dig> and one major host cell protein band running at the size of the large subunit of rubisco. yields were determined by densitometric analysis of sds-page lanes containing the e <dig> fractions against a bsa standard curve derived from  <dig> different concentrations of bsa. the clear differences in yield between the er-retarded and the chloroplast-targeted variant of the protein were observed in several other experiments . figure 2c shows the average e <dig> yields obtained after three expression and purification experiments of pfgap50-ctph , 7 g leaf material for each repeat) and pfgap50-erh . the differences are statistically significant p =  <dig> . the higher accumulation levels of intact pfgap <dig> also correlated with the achieved relative abundance calculated by densitometric analysis of sds-page image  for each purification experiment. for both pfgap <dig> variants  the highest purity was obtained in the third elution step  at 250 mm imidazole, while the previous step at 100 mm imidazole still contained a number of host cell proteins, presumably the large subunit of the rubisco together with the recombinant protein. this protein was also present as the major contamination in the e <dig> fraction. in e <dig> pfgap50-ctph was obtained at a relative abundance of  <dig> % ±  <dig>  while pfgap50-erh was less pure . the corresponding e <dig> fraction from an up-scaled infiltration experiment  was used for the immunization of rabbits as described in the methods section.fig.  <dig> sds-page/immunoblot analysis of plant produced pfgap <dig>  a: purification of plastid-targeted pfgap <dig> . for purification,  <dig>  g infiltrated leaf material were used. reducing sds-page  and immunoblot . b: purification of er-retarded pfgap <dig> . for purification,  <dig>  g infiltrated leaf material were used. reducing sds-page  and immunoblot . m: prestained protein marker , 1: 3 μl load , 2: 3 μl flow-through, 3: 6 μl elution step  <dig> , 4: 6 μl elution step  <dig> , 5: 6 μl elution step  <dig> . western blot was detected with rabbit anti-his <dig> serum and alkaline phosphatase labeled goat anti rabbit serum. c: plot of mean values and standard deviation of the yields for finally purified  pfgap50-ctph and pfgap50-erh, determined by densitometric analysis  of sds-page from three independent replicates 



determination of antigen-specific titers
to initially assess the immunogenicity and parasite inhibitory efficacy of the recombinant pfgap50-ctph, two rabbits were immunized using a hyper immunization protocol. endpoint igg titers against pfgap <dig> were determined in serum samples taken on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as described in the methods section. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the resulting titers are moderate for both rabbits with a maximum antibody titer observed after day  <dig> with 1: <dig>  x  <dig> for rabbit number two. the titers did not increase after subsequent boosts.fig.  <dig>

immunofluorescence assay
an ifa was used to determine the reactivity of pfgap50-specific rabbit immune igg against p. falciparum schizonts, gametocytes and gametes. as shown in fig.  <dig>  rabbit antibodies raised against pfgap <dig> specifically labeled the surfaces of the three different stages. co-labeling with mouse antibodies against pfmsp <dig> and pfs <dig> was used for stage-specific counterstaining. no fluorescence signal was observed when nrs was used for immunolabeling in control experiments.fig.  <dig> indirect immunofluorescence assays demonstrating the reactivity of pfgap <dig> specific rabbit immune igg against different stage p. falciparum parasites. ifas were performed on schizonts, gametocytes and gametes, using pfgap <dig> specific rabbit immune igg or igg purified from neutral rabbit serum  as a negative control. mouse anti-pfs <dig> and anti-pfmsp <dig> antibodies were used to co-label the sexual-stage  and blood stage  parasites, respectively. mouse antibodies were visualized with alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies  and rabbit antibodies with alexa fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies . bar = 5 μm



zygote inhibition assay 
the ability of pfgap50-specific rabbit immune igg to inhibit zygote development was measured using a zia. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we observed up to  <dig> % zygote inhibition activity when using 1 mg/ml of the purified rabbit igg .fig.  <dig> zygote inhibition assay  with pfgap <dig> specific rabbit immune igg. the transmission-blocking potential of the pfgap50-ctph specific rabbit immune igg  and rabbit  <dig> ) from 2nd  and 3rd bleed  was assessed in a zia experiment in comparison with igg purified from neutral rabbit serum  as a negative control. inhibition was calculated as the reciprocal value of zygote numbers in comparison with the negative control. error bars were derived by generating mean and sd of the values obtained for immune igg from the two individual rabbits using data from three technical replicates



discussion
mosquirix , a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine candidate based on pfcsp presented on the surface of hepatitis b virus-like particles is now approaching final regulatory approval. anyhow, data from the respective clinical trials indicate that this vaccine will not match the efficacy and the sustainability of vaccines against other infectious diseases and suggests further efforts towards improved malaria vaccine formulations eventually featuring additional antigens from the blood and the sexual stages of the parasite to introduce functionalities that complement the strategy of inducing sterile protection by immune responses against pre-erythrocytic antigens. in this context a vaccine component that provides transmission blocking activity is being regarded as a valuable contribution to the goal of malaria eradication.

here, we describe the transient plant-based production and characterization of pfgap <dig> as transmission-blocking vaccine candidate antigen. we have used the a. tumefaciens-based transient plant expression platform successfully in previous studies for the expression and characterization of different p. falciparum antigens from the pre-erythrocytic, the blood and the sexual stage as single proteins  <cit>  or as fusions  <cit> . along this line, and driven by the overall vision of implementing this platform for the rapid and cost efficient production of vaccine antigens in the context of malaria vaccine r&d and finally even clinical material, we were interested to evaluate the feasibility to use the transient plant-based expression to produce pfgap <dig> suitable for the induction of parasite-specific inhibitory antibodies.

bosch et al.  <cit>  have produced folded, soluble pfgap <dig> in the cytosol of e. coli for structural studies. these results indicate that pfgap <dig> may not depend on an oxidative environment like the plant endoplasmatic reticulum  for correct folding. therefore, making use of the possibility to easily address different subcellular compartments within the plants, we generated two expression constructs featuring pfgap <dig>  one er-retarded and the other one targeted to the plastids. even though plastids lack oxidative conditions and the complex, chaperon-based folding machinery of the secretory pathway constituted by the er and the golgi apparatus, high-level expression of recombinant proteins has been achieved in plastids for several examples with transient, targeting-based  <cit>  and stable, transplastomic approaches  <cit> .

in our study we observed significantly higher yields for recombinant pfgap <dig>  targeted to the plastids when compared to pfgap <dig>  accumulated in the er. these values were calculated by quantification of the finalmaterial  and related to yield after extraction and purification. the differences in achieved purities  resulted from a constant amount  of a predominant co-purified host cell protein .

the observation that a 4-fold higher yield could be achieved by chloroplast targeting compared to the er-retarded version of pfgap <dig> was not predictable, but indicates that this strategy should be generally considered when using plant expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins at optimal yields. in a study on the transient and stable plant-based expression of different hiv-i antigen constructs meyers et al.  <cit>  also compared er-retardation with chloroplast targeting and found large protein-specific differences in yields, including up to 20-fold higher  or 4-fold lower yields , by chloroplast targeting compared to er-retardation. these results also emphasize the versatility of the transient plant expression system as a tool in vaccine candidate development and evaluation, since different properties and requirements of heterologous proteins like vaccine candidate antigens can be addressed by simply testing the respective proteins in the context of different subcellular targeting options.

the yields of  <dig> and 4 μg/g flw were calculated for comparative purposes only considering the pfgap <dig> amounts found in the elution fraction e <dig>  since it is obvious that also the fraction e <dig> contains relevant amounts of pfgap <dig>  it can be speculated that by developing a more advanced extraction and purification strategy  <cit>  it should be possible to significantly increase the yield of pfgap50-ctph towards levels of 30-50 μg/g flw. these assumptions can be used to briefly asses the question of economic perspectives of the production of this transmission-blocking vaccine candidate by transient expression in plants. as basis for this estimation one can refer to the numbers provided by tusé et al.  <cit>  in an article about the manufacturing economics of plant-made biologics. in this context the per/dose production costs  for a recombinant butyrylcholinesterase manufactured by transient plant-based expression for therapeutic purposes were calculated as  <dig> $  per dose based on the following variables . adapting this calculation to a 25 μg dose, the per/dose production costs for pfgap <dig> at an overall yield of 50 μg/g would be  <dig>  $ or  <dig>  $ at an overall yield  of 16 μg/g at a capacity of  <dig>  <dig> 000– <dig>  <dig>  <dig> doses per year. these numbers can be combined with previously calculated numbers presented by  <cit>  assuming that downstream costs will typically account for around  <dig> % of the total production costs. for the pfgap <dig> scenario this would mean between  <dig>  $  and  <dig>  $ . with these total production costs it should be possible to match a vaccine price that would provide cost effectiveness in a malaria endemic region, given a sufficient efficacy of the vaccine. based on models  <cit>  and empirical data  <cit>  the cost effectiveness of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine  and more specifically rts,s  has been calculated. these complex calculations do rely on a large number of factors, including efficacy, transmission rate, and look at the socio-economic impact of mild, as well as severe infections and therefore should be regarded as a very rough estimate, when being transferred to another scenario. anyhow, together with the results from another modeling approach that also involves transmission blocking vaccines  <cit>  it seems reasonable to assume cost effectiveness of a decent transmission blocking vaccine at a vaccine price somewhere between  <dig> and  <dig> $, and therefore roughly 10-times higher than the assumed total production costs for pfgap <dig> derived from a calculation that was working with a production facility able to produce  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> doses per year.

because of the better yields and higher purity, the plastid-targeted pfgap50-ctph was chosen for rabbit immunization studies. using a standard hyper immunization protocol moderate titers below 1:1x105were observed in both rabbits. in contrast to other rabbit immunizations we conducted with plant-produced p. falciparum antigens under the same conditions  <cit> , in this study we did not observe an increase of antigen-specific titers after the second and/or the third boost. in contrast, for rabbit r <dig> the titers even slightly decreased over the course of the immunization period. there are different possible explanations for this somehow unexpected result  but given the low number of animals  used in this study the observation should probably not be overestimated.

the ability of pfgap50-ctph-specific rabbit igg to recognize pfgap <dig> in its native context was assessed by immunofluorescence assays. in these experiments, a staining of blood stage  as well as sexual stage parasites  was observed. because in schizonts and gametocytes before activation the pfgap <dig> is part of the actin-myosin motor complex driven invasion machinery  associated to the multi-protein complex called inner membrane complex , the cell membranes were permeabilized by saponin washing upon preparation of these samples. these results correlate well with what has been observed by simon et al.  <cit>  after mouse immunization studies performed with recombinant pfgap50-gst fusions produced in e. coli and confirm that properly folded pfgap <dig> could be produced by transient plant-based expression.

to initially investigate the parasite inhibitory and thereby transmission-blocking potential of the pfgap50-ctph-specific antibodies a zygote inhibition assay was performed by the addition of pfgap50-ctph-specific rabbit immune igg to gametocyte cultures. the observed reduction of zygote numbers after 16 h of incubation between  <dig> % and  <dig> % is in good accordance with the  <dig> % reduction observed by simon et al.  <cit>  with pfgap50-specific murine antibodies, providing another indication that the plant-produced pfgap <dig> is functional regarding the presentation of inhibitory epitopes and is generally suitable as component of a transmission-blocking malaria vaccine formulation.

taken together the results encourage the investigation of chloroplast targeting for other malaria vaccine constructs using the transient expression system. this would be especially interesting for antigens like pfs <dig>  pfama <dig>  pfmsp <dig> or others that contain potential n-linked glycosylation sites which are not post-translationally modified in the native context because plasmodium lacks the molecular machinery for n-linked glycosylation  <cit> . in most cases when potentially n-glycosylated p.falciparum antigens are produced in eukaryotic expression hosts n-glycosylation is being prevented by mutation of the nxt/s motifs in the amino acid sequence of the proteins  <cit> . another option that has been applied for the generation of diversity covering variants of pfama <dig>  <cit>  is the identification of allelic variations that do not contain the motive at a respective site, allowing to use a native p.falciparum sequence instead of an artificial one resulting from the introduced mutation of the n or the t/s residue. using chloroplast targeting, it is possible to express the fully native, non-glycosylated protein sequence in an environment that is suitable for the expression of at least some folded proteins as already shown for the expression of the disulfide-rich p.falciparum sexual stage vaccine antigens pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> in the chloroplasts of the eukaryotic green microalgae, chlamydomonas reinhardtii by gregory et al.  <cit> . another advantage of chloroplast targeting is the option to attach the recombinant antigens to starch granules by fusion to the granule bound starch synthase , which enables the presentation of the antigen in the context of starch granules offering alternative purification strategies as well as potentially improved immunogenicity by the particulate format. this concept has been successfully proven with plasmodium berghei and plasmodium falciparum antigens expressed in a starch granule bound format in c. reinhardtii by dauvillée et al.  <cit>  and also the high immunogenicity of rts,s the clinically most advanced malaria vaccine candidate based on the presentation of the pre-erythrocytic antigen pfcsp on the surface of hepatitis b virus s antigen  based virus like particles, suggests the presentation of malaria antigens in a particulate format. in this context it should be also mentioned that plants also offer the possibility to express virus like particles from plant virus coat protein fusion proteins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrate that pfgap <dig> can be successfully produced in plants by transient transfection, and that significantly higher levels can be obtained by chloroplast targeting. the plant-produced pfgap <dig> is functional regarding the presentation of inhibitory epitopes, can be used to induce parasite inhibitory antibodies and therefore should be considered as an interesting component of a transmission-blocking malaria vaccine formulation. based on these promising results, we will focus on further optimizing the protein expression and purification as well as on strategies to improve the immunogenicity of the recombinant protein or its formulation before proceeding towards more detailed studies involving more animals and additional, more detailed, functional characterization of the protein itself as well as corresponding immune igg in different parasite inhibition assays.
