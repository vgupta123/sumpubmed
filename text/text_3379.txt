BACKGROUND
different families of repetitive dna contribute towards architectural organization of the mammalian genomes  <cit> . they represent both, tandemly arranged and interspersed sequences  <cit> . based on their size and mode of propagation, interspersed elements can be divided into two separate classes, the long terminal repeat  and non-ltr. the non ltr lines  and sines  are widely distributed occupying a substantial fraction of the eukaryotic genomes. these elements replicate and proliferate themselves through a "copy and paste" mechanism called retrotransposition  <cit> . in this process, transcription of their genomic copies is followed by an rna intermediate resulting cdnas reintegration at a new location in the genome  <cit> . approximately,  <dig> line and sine families have been reported to date in various eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . in mammals, line, l <dig> repeats are dominant retrotransposons type both in the common ancestor and in extant species  <cit> . in addition to l <dig>  an element belonging to the retrotransposable element family of autonomous retrotransposons  has been reported in mammals  <cit> . few mammals have active non ltr line other than l <dig> that contribute significantly to repeat composition.

species specific retrotransposons have been widely used as a tool for phylogenetic analysis and population studies  <cit> . many retrotransposons are inactive, found in the non-coding regions of the genome and are subjected only to the neutral evolution. thus, rare new insertions have led to some form of advantageous or noteworthy phenotypic variations  <cit> . these and other such discoveries have resulted in a shift from earlier thought of them being "parasite" to functional elements cultivated in the genome for their beneficial attributes.

retrotransposons have gained novel functions, providing alternative splice sites and/or polyadenylation signals or modifying gene expression  <cit> . these elements account for  <dig> % of bovine genome  <cit> . the bovine genome is very different in its repeat composition compared to other mammalian genomes. it has unusual composition of line rte type bov b and its associated sine elements which together account for 25% of the bovine genome  <cit> . the impact of the interspersed repeats on the genomes of human  <cit> , dog  <cit> , cow  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and opossum  <cit>  has been studied. however fate of these interspersed elements and their association with mrna transcriptomes in buffalo remains still unclear. here, we report rsai family repetitive dna in the genome of water buffalo "bubalus bubalis" and their copy number status. we also studied their expression in somatic tissues and spermatozoa. the repeat fraction pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization  with buffalo metaphase chromosomes. in addition, we isolated and sequenced acot <dig>  gene harboring part of pdp <dig> repeat.

RESULTS
rsai enzyme digestion uncovers four repeat fractions
digestion of buffalo genomic dna with rsai enzyme, besides minor ones, showed four prominent bands ranging from  <dig> base pairs, pdp1;  <dig>  pdp2;  <dig>  pdp3; to 339; pdp <dig> . approximately, 15- <dig> recombinant clones subjected to restriction digestion and slot blot hybridization screening yielded ten positive clones for each repeat. five-six clones from each fragment were then sequenced. the accession numbers of the recombinant clones are given in the additional file  <dig>  all the four major repeat elements were at rich but sequence-wise, were different from one another . no inter-clonal variations were detected in these sequences. however, random repeats were present in the nucleotide sequences . repeat masker programme revealed presence of ltr line, sine elements within the four fragments . blast search for each clone showed 69-98% homology with genomic dna/contigs and 68-93% with transcribing genes in the database  mostly in utrs .

buffalo derived rsai open reading frame  has amino acid similarity to line reverse transcriptase
most striking feature of pdp <dig> sequence was the presence of  <dig> bp, + <dig> orf  . blastp search with genbank sequences using conceptual translation of this orf  gave matches to putative reverse transcriptase's domain. this region corresponds to central position of the reverse transcriptase orf . similarly, pdp <dig>   <dig> bp, + <dig> orf  and pdp <dig>   <dig> bp, + <dig> orf  showed homology to endonuclease reverse transcriptase . these orfs corresponded to central endonuclease reverse transcriptase of line <dig> orf <dig> . pdp <dig> sequence, <dig> bp, + <dig> orf  showed no similarity with endonuclease reverse transcriptase.

rsai repeat status among bovids
independent cross hybridization of pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> with genomic dna from different species  under high stringent conditions showed signals only in bovids . pcr conducted using region specific primers  amplified bands in buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomic dna . southern hybridization of two representative rsai sequence pdp <dig>  and pdp <dig> showed same number of bands within the genomic dna of bovids . prominent bands within the smear reflect identical size of the fragments dispersed throughout the bovid genomes. clustalw alignment of  <dig> bp pdp1derived fragment with cattle , goat  and sheep  showed high level of sequence conservation among the bovids . phylogenetically, with respect to all the four sequences, cattle and buffalo were found to be closer to each other , constituting the same monophyletic group.

differential expression of rsai fragments in somatic tissue and spermatozoa of buffalo
rt-pcr analysis using internal primers of pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> and pdp <dig>  and cdna from somatic tissues and spermatozoa of buffalo showed amplification of band across tissues and sperm confirming their transcriptional potentials . quantitative real time pcr analysis of these sequences showed differential expression of rsai related transcripts across somatic tissues and spermatozoa . pdp <dig> showed highest expression in lung, pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> in kidney and pdp <dig> in ovary. summary of the relative expression  derived from 2-ΔΔct values obtained for various transcripts based on real time pcr are given in table  <dig>

the pair of internal primers deduced from pdp1- <dig> used for expression study was also employed for copy number analysis of these fragments in cattle buffalo, goat and sheep using real time pcr. standard curve slope value was between  <dig> - <dig> . single melting peak on dissociate curve confirmed primer specificity. pdp <dig> showed ~ <dig> ×  <dig> copies, pdp <dig> and pdp <dig>  ~  <dig> copies each and pdp <dig> showed ~  <dig>  in these species .

pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> sequences are dispersed throughout the buffalo genome
in silico analysis of pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> sequences using reference cattle genome revealed its multiple locations on the cow chromosomes . probing of pdp <dig> to buffalo genomic dna digested with rsai enzyme detected a strong hybridization signal  giving rise to a single isomorphic band in all the samples. fish mapping of pdp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> spectrum red labeled cloned probes showed ubiquitous discernible signals over buffalo metaphase chromosomes . all the chromosomes showed dispersed pattern with all the three probes used independently. in several chromosomes, signals in the centromeric regions were absent or reduced giving rise to inconsistent pattern. fish with pdp <dig> sequence showed more localized signals on the metaphase chromosomes as compared to that detected by pdp <dig> and pdp <dig>  fish with spectrum red labeled clone pdp <dig> probe showed background signals even after washing the slides under high stringent conditions . this might be due to the short length  of the probe pdp <dig> used coupled with its dispersed genomic organization.

full length cdna sequence of acot <dig> gene in buffalo
blast search using reference mrna sequence revealed rsai repeats to be part of acyl-coenzyme a thioesterase  <dig>  vacuolar protein sorting  <dig>  and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1a <dig>  genes  full length buffalo acot <dig> cdna was generated using end point pcr and gene specific  primers . assembled cdna sequence of  <dig> base pair fragment lacking poly a tail representing six exons  were deposited in the genbank .

discussion
we have studied four  rsai fragments from the buffalo genome which are at rich, though buffalo genome on the whole is gc rich . database searches with the repeat-maskers revealed the presence of several ltr, line and sine element in the four sequences . apparently, sines occupy the -rich regions while lines are mainly located on the -rich regions. reports suggest that very large number of highly truncated insertions of l <dig> have occurred in the bovine genome  <cit> . full length copies of the human l <dig> contain two open reading frames, orf <dig> and  <dig>  orf <dig> encodes a dna binding protein and orf <dig> includes endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains  <cit> . presence of partial reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains in pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> reported herein led to the hypothesis that rsai repeats might be related to a novel retrotransposable element.

interspersed repeats get inserted into a new genomic location through the process of retrotransposition  <cit> . this is reflected by our fish results of pdp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showing signals on all over the chromosomes with varying intensity. in silico analysis of pdp <dig> on the reference cattle genome showed fewer distribution suggesting its poor characterization in the cattle genome. this is supported by the fact that using real time pcr, we detected similar copy number of pdp <dig> in the bovids. repetitive sequences in centromeric regions are dynamic components, ever prone to mutation, recombination, deletion, and translocation leading eventually to their alterations  <cit> . absence of rsai sequences in the centromere of several chromosomes may be undergoing such events. all the four sequences showed no homology with each other as revealed by clustalw alignment . startlingly, these four repeat elements were not detected in any of the non-bovid species. this suggests that irrespective of their origin and biological significance, their evolutions have been confined to limited number of species. most likely, in non-bovid species, they were not favored evolutionarily and therefore purged slowly and gradually in due course of time. we presume that amplifications of repeat elements could have originated from its discrete blocks. reintegration of extra chromosomal copies of these repeat elements  <cit>  could have allowed its further dissemination in the genome. however, it is not clear whether all the repeats have similar significance in the buffalo genome. it is likely that these repeats are collectively involved in the evolution and sustenance of bovid chromosomes. reports suggest that new retrotransposons are conserved within the same group of species  <cit> . this is corroborated by our slot blot and pcr results. real time pcr results showed approximately similar copy numbers for pdp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in cattle, goat and sheep genomes as mentioned earlier. the copy number assessment of these repeats in different known and non-descript breeds of buffalo may enable to establish a correlation, if any, towards the delineation of different breeds.

retrotransposons copies are reportedly involved in the regulation of transcription  <cit> . presence of rsai repeats in exonic database of various transcribing genes suggests that these sequences function as parts of mrna. since repeat sequences were also present in the introns, it is possible that they are transcribed as pre-mrna and contribute to the processing of mrna and splicing. thus, differential expression of transcripts in somatic tissue and spermatozoa might be under the influence of post transcriptional regulation required for various cellular processes. presence of transcribing retroelements within the buffalo spermatozoa reported here seems to be first such observation. studies have shown existence of an rt-dependent mechanism operating in the spermatozoa, responsible for the genesis of new biologically active retrogenes  <cit> . these retrogenes may be delivered to the embryos during fertilization and propagated subsequently in the tissues of adult individuals  <cit> .

rsai elements were found to be part of the three functional genes  mostly present in 3' utr. our work corroborates recent reports that most part of retrotransposons inserts themselves in first and last exons and in untranslated regions   <cit> . in human, this type of insertion has been shown to create new non-conserved polyadenylation signals  <cit> , influencing the level of gene expression  <cit> . however, how these insertions affect expression of buffalo transcriptomes is still a matter of speculation.

CONCLUSIONS
buffalo has several known and non-descript breeds of which a few are considered to be superior with respect to productivity and economic return. whether, rsai repeat in different breeds of buffalo would show similar organization and expression pattern is not known. however, if informative in breed delineation, these would prove to be useful biomarkers.
