BACKGROUND
tandem repeats  are stretches of dna that contain nucleotide patterns repeated adjacent to one another and are common throughout the human genome  <cit> . trs are classified by repeat unit length into further categories including microsatellites, or short tandem repeats , which are repeats with a unit length of less than  <dig> nucleotides or base pairs . trs display a non-random distribution and a particular bias in location to genic and regulatory regions  <cit> . in humans, approximately 17% of genes contain trs within their coding regions  <cit> . in yeast , approximately 25% of all gene promoters contain at least one tandem repeat , many of these trs consisting of short, at-rich sequences and the distribution of trs in human gene promoters is similar  <cit> .

trs have a propensity to mutate and become polymorphic by expansion or contraction in the number of repeat units. this may be due to slippage during dna replication, through unequal crossing-over during recombination, or by imprecise repair of double-strand dna breaks  <cit> . trs exhibit mutation rates around  <dig> to 105-fold higher than average rates for non-repeated dna in other parts of the genome  <cit> . such polymorphic trs are often described as variable number of tandem repeats . the frequency of tr mutations is dependent upon the length of the repeat unit , the number of repeat units, and the percentage match to the consensus sequence or “purity” of the repeat tract  <cit> . the number of repeat units and purity of the repeat tract are the most important predictors for repeat variability, with an increase in the number of repeats and/or purity resulting in a higher propensity to be polymorphic  <cit> . naslund et al.  found that doubling the repeat unit number corresponded to a 15-fold increase in the likelihood of the repeat being polymorphic and for each 10% increase in repeat purity, an 18-fold increase in likelihood of polymorphism resulted.

strs are a common source of genetic variation in promoter regions and alleles can be highly variable in length. in humans, the rate of str length polymorphism within 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site  is over 12-fold higher than in exonic regions,  <dig> -fold higher than in untranslated regions  and almost comparable to the rate in intragenic and intronic regions  <cit> . despite this hyper-variability, there is also evidence for promoter localised strs being evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . the conservation rate of strs is dependent upon the proximity to the tss, with closer strs more likely to be conserved  <cit> .

polymorphic trs can affect transcription by a number of means. length polymorphism has consequences for transcription, with tr-containing promoters showing significantly higher rates of transcriptional expression divergence  <cit> . in yeast, it is known that nucleosome position is inversely correlated with tandem repeat positions with nucleosome depletion being especially pronounced around at-rich repeats  <cit> . in addition, altering the length of trs in promoter regions directly affects the local chromatin structure resulting in altered transcriptional activity and gene expression  <cit> . further, potential sites of z-dna are enriched at the promoter and 5’-end of human genes  <cit>  and z-dna, which expels bound nucleosomes, is more likely to form where the ac/gt dinucleotide repeat is present  <cit> . combined, the exceptionally high polymorphism rate, evolutionary conservation around the tss and evidence for transcriptional regulation suggests that promoter strs are functional and may be an important source of rapid evolutionary change. if so, strs should also be associated with disease.

polymorphic trs are implicated in more than  <dig> neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as spinobulbar muscular atrophy  <cit>  and huntington’s disease  <cit> ; as well as other complex disorders such as anxiety  <cit> , mental retardation  <cit>  and diabetes  <cit> ; and several cancers, such as colorectal  <cit>  and prostate cancer  <cit> . in the regulatory region, polymorphic strs in the fli <dig>  ece-1c and cd <dig> gene promoters have been associated with lupus  <cit> , alzheimer’s disease  <cit>  and primary cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders  <cit> , respectively.

while there is mounting evidence that strs are an important class of genetic variation with links to disease phenotypes and evolution of the human genome, their use in genetic studies has reduced with the advent of massively parallel single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis and genome-wide association studies   <cit> . compared with snps, strs show extremely rapid evolution, indicative of increased variability between individual sub-populations. the observed enrichment of strs in genic and regulatory regions  <cit>  also suggests potentially larger phenotype effects than many common snps. hypervariable strs in regulatory regions may explain some of the missing heritability unaccounted for by gwas of complex disease  <cit> . from a human genetics perspective, this untapped source of regulatory str variation could be important and also complementary to gwas studies. increasing interest over the past decade in the noncoding regions of the human genome, which has been described as “the control architecture of the system”  <cit> , further highlights the important role that variation in these regions plays. considering the influential role of strs in regulating gene expression, the importance of this source of genetic variation has been over-looked.

there is currently no catalogue or easy to use resource available for studying strs in the regulatory regions of human genes. this study aimed to identify, characterise and compare strs in the upstream regulatory region of human genes on a genome-wide scale and establish a resource to allow the interrogation of strs in this region. by screening the entire human genome, using tandem repeat finder  <cit> , sql code and the ucsc genome browser  <cit> , for strs present in a  <dig> kilobase region at the 5’-end of all human genes, we have identified  <dig>  strs across  <dig>  genes. the information describing the location and characteristics of these strs is presented in the short tandem repeats in regulatory regions table, or starrrt . this resource is suitable for researchers with limited bioinformatics experience who are interested in specific strs, genes or phenotypes. we have identified a unique signature of str enrichment in the regulatory regions of human genes which is most pronounced within neural genes, and calcium signaling and neurological pathways. this paper presents the findings from investigations of the distribution and abundance of strs in the 5’ regulatory region of human genes, highlighting the importance of strs in neurological pathways and in recent evolution of the human genome.

RESULTS
starrrt is a comprehensive, user-friendly resource with wide application
the resource, starrrt, was designed to identify tandem repeats in the regulatory region of genes as these may alter transcription due to their location. further, the discovery of polymorphic regulatory region tandem repeats can serve as genetic markers linked to traits. there are many definitions of what constitutes a gene regulatory region. typically, eukaryotic genes contain a core promoter, which is about 100 bp long and centered at the transcription start site , and a proximal promoter about 250 bp immediately upstream and downstream of the tss  <cit> . for our analyses, we define the core and proximal promoter as having the coordinates  and  respectively, relative to the tss. there is evidence to show that some human promoters have control elements in the region − <dig> to −500 bp upstream of the tss that can reduce gene expression  <cit> . similarly, the 5’-utr is known to have regulatory control elements that effect transcription  <cit> . the starrrt resource covers a 3 kb region spanning − <dig> to + <dig>  with respect to the tss . further rationale for the selection of this region is given in the methods.

to increase the utility of starrrt, the resource is restricted to short tandem repeats , due to their abundance, polymorphic nature and frequent use as genetic markers. in order to increase the chance of variable strs being predominately represented in starrrt, we have restricted the purity to greater than or equal to 90%. we define an str, also known as a microsatellite, as those trs with period of  <dig> to 9 bp. tandem repeats were identified from the ucsc ‘simplerepeats’ table, which contains output from the tandem repeat finder  program  <cit> . trf uses distribution theory to detect trs and also uses a minimum alignment score, with smaller period trs requiring higher numbers of repeats to qualify. the ‘simplerepeats’ table does not explicitly specify the trf input parameters - minimum score, scoring weights, mismatch penalties, nor the matching probability  or indel probability . we determined some of these parameters empirically. within the table the minimum reported score was found to be  <dig> and dividing this by the product of the period by the number of repeats shows the scoring weight must be set as  <dig>  this infers the minimum reported str size is 25 bp in length.

the starrrt resource is a spreadsheet that outlines the position and characteristics of  <dig>  strs present in a 3 kb regulatory region upstream of  <dig>  human ncbi reference sequence gene transcripts   <cit> . starrrt characterises each str by giving, among other details: the position of the str in relation to the transcription start site  of the gene , the position of the str in the genome , the period , the number of repeats, the consensus sequence , and the purity of the repeat . a complete outline of the details provided in starrrt is shown in table  <dig> and a sample of the starrrt resource is provided as table  <dig>  starrrt is publically available and can be accessed at http://www.newcastleinnovationhealth.com.au/starrrt. by using the various identifiers, genome locations or metrics, users can search, sort, filter or merge other data with starrrt without the need for extensive bioinformatics knowledge and experience. these tasks can be handled within excel®  or by importing the table into a relational database.

1an str only appears in starrrt if the gene has a refseq database identifier; 2an str only appears in starrrt if the gene has an hgnc gene symbol; 3txpos was limited to − <dig> to +1000 bp in the creation of starrrt; 4sr = simple repeats, as appears in the ucsc genome browser; 5period was limited to  <dig> to 9 bp; 6permatch was limited to ≥ 90%.

this simplified sample of starrrt shows the details for the first  <dig> strs in starrrt. the number of columns have been reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> shown here due to size limitations. starrrt can be viewed in its entirety at http://www.newcastleinnovationhealth.com.au/starrrt.

downstream of the tss, starrrt strs may be located within the 5’-utr or the coding region. we note  <dig>  transcripts of the  <dig>   transcripts present in refseq  have 5’-utr regions that will go beyond the 1 kb downstream limit of this resource ; hence, starrrt is not comprehensive for all strs in 5’-utrs. similarly, for the  <dig>  transcripts with a 5’-utr shorter than 1 kb, an str  presented in starrrt may be present in the coding region. the position of the str within the upstream region, 5’-utr or coding region can be calculated by comparing the srstart:srend coordinates with the chromstart:chromend  and cdsstart:cdsend  coordinates.

general characteristics of starrrt strs relative to genic or all strs
of the  <dig>   transcripts present in refseq ,  <dig>  gene transcripts  were found to contain at least one str with purity of at least 90% in the 3 kb regulatory region analysed ; so,  <dig> % of all genes in the human genome.

the most common strs throughout the human genome are dinucleotides, and this is also the case for starrrt strs . together, strs with periods of  <dig> and  <dig> comprise over half of all strs in the starrrt resource, with frequencies of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. compared with all  strs, there are a higher proportion of strs with period of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the starrrt resource and less with periods of  <dig> or  <dig> . for strs in starrrt, the number of strs generally decreases as the period increases . this is a similar distribution to that observed for tandem repeats in noncoding regions of the human genome  <cit> . as starrrt strs may overlap the upstream region , proximal promoter , 5’-utr and exons, the distribution of starrrt strs by period has features observed in each of these separate distributions . comparison of starrrt strs to the unfiltered set of strs in the regulatory region shows the 90% purity filter of starrrt increases the proportion of period  <dig> and  <dig> strs markedly, while strs from all other periods are reduced. the period  <dig> and  <dig> frequencies observed in starrrt more closely resemble that of 5’-utrs and introns .

we note the more than 2-fold increase in the frequency of starrrt strs  with period of  <dig>  this is likely due to the encompassing of the proximal promoter in the regulatory region and the inclusion of some exon regions downstream of the tss. compared to all categories other than exons, the number of period  <dig> strs in proximal promoters is more than 4-fold increased. more broadly, the distribution of strs in proximal promoters with a multiple of  <dig>  is very similar to that in exons . this increase is offset by the relative decrease in frequency of strs with period  <dig> and  <dig> 

distribution of starrrt strs show distinct trends at the tss and in the proximal and core promoters
to assess the nature of the  str distribution over the 3 kb regulatory region, starrrt period, base composition and repeat unit length distributions were plotted with respect to the tss coordinate . examination of the density of strs relative to the tss shows a non-uniform distribution with more starrrt strs upstream of the tss  and characteristics of a wave-like unevenness in density. downstream of the tss, the overall density of strs is reduced and the local peaks and troughs in density are less distinct.

when the repeats in figure 3a are decomposed into subpopulations classified by repeat period, a number of trends emerge . the most striking observation is the increased density of repeats with period of  <dig>  in the region approximately  <dig> bases upstream and downstream of the tss and the predominance of repeats with period of  <dig>  in the region + <dig> to + <dig>  downstream of the tss. upstream of the tss, peaks and troughs in repeat density are present with some regularity; in particular, the density of strs with periods of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  using waves as an analogy, in the region − <dig> bases to approximately − <dig> bases, relative to the tss, the densities of strs with periods of  <dig> and  <dig> are in phase before becoming anti-phased from − <dig> bases until approximately − <dig> bases, relative to the tss. this change in phase coincides with an increase in the abundance of strs with period of  <dig> 

the base composition and repeat unit length of strs in the regulatory region also have distinct patterns. for the most part, repeats are at-rich; however, there is a profound change towards gc-rich repeats, with fewer repeat units surrounding the tss . this region of change correlates strongly with the large increase in period  <dig>  repeats noted earlier . these gc-rich, relatively low repeat unit trinucleotide repeats overlap with the proximal promoter, defined as  <dig> upstream to  <dig> downstream of the tss . a further decomposition of the data in figure  <dig> into  <dig>  cpg island overlapping and  <dig>  non-cpg island overlapping regulatory regions shows the tss proximal gc-rich, trinucleotide repeats are situated particularly in cpg island containing regulatory regions . interestingly, the smaller set of regulatory regions without an overlapping cpg island, seem to exclude strs in the region just before the tss until approximately 100 bp downstream . they also exhibit a periodic and anti-phased increase and decrease in adenine and thymine base composition.

starrrt strs are found in genes involved in metabolism, signal transduction and the neurological system
to determine if strs are associated with particular biological pathways or processes, the  <dig>  gene loci within starrrt were analysed with gene set enrichment analysis  methods; the controlled vocabulary approach implemented in the h-invitational database  enrichment analysis tool . two disparate gsea methods were used for comparison and we gave more weight to the interpretation of findings consistent to both gsea approaches. as the degree of str polymorphism in intragenic regions is also high  <cit> , we considered the possibility that the enrichment we observed is not limited to the regulatory region, but is instead representative of a broader genic enrichment signature. for the heat analysis, we compared the starrrt gene set enrichment findings to those of genes with strs in the intragenic region, so exons and introns. in the starrrt set, the  <dig>  strs across the  <dig>  gene loci were mapped to  <dig>  h-invdb transcript  identifiers  and analysed using the heat web tool. for the exonic str gene set we gathered all genes with at least one str in any exon regardless of purity . as the intronic region is typically much larger than the exonic or regulatory region we found approximately a third of all genes  had a least one str in an intron. we reduced these genes down to a size more appropriate for gene set enrichment analysis and comparable to that in the starrrt and exonic sets. this reduction was performed using two approaches; a filtering and a random subset approach. filtering was performed by limiting analyses to those genes with the highest quartile of ≥ 90% purity strs per kilobase of intron. this intentional bias was based on the assumption that genes with the uppermost high purity intronic str densities are more likely to have polymorphic strs under evolutionary selection. filtering created a set of  <dig>  strs in  <dig>  genes mapping to  <dig>  hit ids in total. for the random subsets, ten random samples of genes containing ≥ 90% purity intronic strs were subjected to heat analysis. each set had the same number of hit ids as the starrrt str gene set . we found some degree of variance in the number of significant terms, particularly for kegg pathways . however, the means of the number of significant terms were similar to the high density set . given this variance, we only report significant terms where the majority of samples  agreed. these results are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in comparing the two intron methods, the filtering method reported  <dig> kegg pathways as enriched , while the random subset method found  <dig> pathways enriched . the high density intron set intersected to a high degree with starrrt  and the random sample intron set , so we concentrated on this set in later analyses.

results from gene set enrichment analysis of the set of transcripts with starrrt strs are shown alongside results for transcripts with strs located in exons and transcripts with the highest density of high purity strs in the introns. results shown are fdr-corrected p-values. a kegg pathway is only presented in the table if at least one of the starrrt, exon or high density intron results has an fdr-corrected p-value of less than  <dig> . columns with “-“ characters are those sets unenriched . “genes” is the number of entities in each set and “enrich” is the ratio of the number of transcripts observed with strs relative to that expected.

the kegg pathways highlighted by the heat analysis clustered around particular cell functions. the pathways, grouped by kegg cellular process, were associated with nucleotide, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, development, cell growth and death, signal transduction, environmental information processing, cellular communication and motility, and the immune, nervous and endocrine systems . interestingly, the kegg gene set enrichment analyses of starrrt, exonic and the high density-enriched intronic strs produced very similar results; of the  <dig> starrrt enriched pathways ,  <dig> pathways were similarly enriched  in the exonic and high-density intronic sets analysed  and all analyses identified a strong enrichment for expression in neural tissue , with starrrt genes showing a particularly strong enrichment . the differences between starrrt and intragenic str genes were mostly in pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, calcium and adipocytokine signaling. the calcium signaling pathway is the most enriched kegg pathway for starrrt strs  but is considerably less enriched for exonic  and high-density intronic str genes . we also note, in contrast to intragenic str genes, starrrt genes are particularly expressed in the skeletal/cardiac muscle tissue  and are more abundantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane of the cell . also, starrrt str genes are associated with a larger number and hence wider range of biological processes and molecular functions than intragenic str genes .

a description of the columns is given in table  <dig> 

the ipa top canonical pathways and top bio functions analyses  were in strong agreement with the heat results. again, most pathways were associated with signal transduction, metabolism, cell growth and death and immune, endocrine and nervous system function. interestingly, in the ipa diseases and disorders analysis, several have a neurological basis; with neurological disease , huntington’s disease , neuromuscular disease  and major depression ) and psychological disorders , bipolar disorder  and depressive disorder ) listed as the top two .

results from comparison of the set of transcripts containing starrrt strs with the reference set ingenuity knowledge base are shown. for “top bio functions”, the number of molecules  relates to genes containing starrrt strs in each enriched functional group. for “top canonical pathways”, the number of str-containing genes, relative to the total number of genes for each canonical pathway, is shown as a fraction and as a ratio . results shown are limited to those with a p-value less than  <dig>  for the “top bio functions” and the  <dig> most significant results with a p-value less than  <dig>  for the “top canonical pathways”.

collectively, the gsea results show that genes with strs in the regulatory region or exons, or those genes with high intronic str density, have enrichments for largely the same classes of gene pathways. these pathways are primarily associated with metabolism, signal transduction, environmental information processing, development, cell growth, death, motility and communication and immune, nervous and endocrine system function. there are some differences between the starrrt, exonic and high-density intronic gene sets in kegg pathways. broadly, starrrt genes have more numerous enrichments and are particularly enriched for calcium signaling.

discussion
by genome-wide analysis, this study has identified that  <dig> % of all human genes contain at least one highly pure str in their upstream regulatory region. this is consistent with the previous suggestion that trs of all period lengths are present within promoter regions of  <dig> to 20% of human genes  <cit> . the upstream promoter region appears to consist of predominantly short , at-rich sequences, which is concordant with the findings of vinces et al. <cit>  in the yeast genome and sawaya et al. <cit>  in human promoters. we demonstrate that in humans, the proximal promoter  and in particular the region overlapping the typical core promoter region  have gc-rich strs. as approximately 72% of human promoters have high gc-content  <cit>  with cpg island density reaching a maximum near the tss  <cit> , we reason this increase in str gc-content reflects the underlying gc-rich promoter sequence.

consistent with a previous genome-wide survey of all strs  <cit> , period  <dig> strs  are the most abundant strs in the regulatory region across human genes. likewise, the distribution of starrrt strs across repeat periods is very similar to that reported by gemayel et al.  for the distribution of all trs in noncoding regions across the human genome  <cit> . however, similar to coding regions, we find a striking enrichment of trinucleotide repeats  in the proximal promoter region, both upstream and downstream of the tss . the similarity of this enrichment signature in regulatory regions to that observed in coding regions  <cit>  is a significant and novel finding, and adds weight to the likely functional significance of these results.

strs in coding regions almost exclusively have a repeat period which is a multiple of  <dig> bases  <cit> ; this is thought to be due to the nature of triplet codons and selection against frameshift mutations  <cit> . while the region upstream of the tss is not transcribed, the abundance of trinucleotide repeats suggests a selection pressure of similar magnitude to that observed in coding regions  <cit> . possible explanations include alternative translation start sites or other functional constraints, possibly related to chromatin structure, nucleosome positioning and/or transcription factor activity. we note that high abundance tss proximal gc-rich repeats and trinucleoide repeats are only associated with regulatory regions overlapping cpg islands. interestingly, the smaller non-cpg island overlapping group is composed of mostly dinucleotides repeats and in the region approximately − <dig> to 500 bp around the tss the repeats have a regular wavelike increase and decrease in adenine and thymine abundance. we speculate this pattern may be associated with nucleosome positioning.

broadly, we suggest that the distribution of strs around the promoter has functional significance, as also proposed recently by sawaya et al. <cit>  following their discovery of a high density of strs at the tss and by kozlowski et al. <cit>  who found non-random distribution of trinucleotide repeats in the exome. altered tr length in or near core promoters can change local nucleosome positioning, is likely to hinder transcription factor binding and therefore affect rates of transcription and hence gene expression  <cit> . it has been shown that changes as small as 2 bp in nucleosome positioning can alter promoter activity  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown in yeast that nucleosome position is negatively correlated with the positioning of trs  <cit> . hence, our findings of profound changes in str period, repeat unit number and base composition around the tss of human genes is interesting given the findings in yeast and indicate that similar mechanisms of regulating gene expression may be at play in the human genome  <cit> . in this regard, a recent study has shown that a polymorphic ga-repeat in the human sox <dig> gene promoter can affect gene expression, with the longer allele resulting in a  <dig> -fold increase in activity  <cit> . the authors report this as first evidence of a functional str in a human gene core promoter  <cit> .

controlled vocabulary gene set enrichment analysis of gene transcripts with starrrt strs in the regulatory region found a number of significantly enriched kegg pathways, go terms and tissues enriched for expression of these genes. these findings have broad overlap with gene set enrichment of gene transcripts having strs in the exons and those gene transcripts with a high density of strs in the intronic regions. regulatory region, exon and intron analyses all show enrichment for expression in neural tissue. enrichment of neurological genes and pathways in the starrrt analysis is consistent with the known role of trs in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders  <cit> . several neurological diseases known to be caused by variable trs also appeared in the starrrt ipa results, namely huntington’s disease and neuromuscular disease, as well as major depression which has a known association with a variable tr  <cit> . starrrt can be used to analyse the role strs may play in the development of various diseases, such as neurological disorders and cancer in which they have already been implicated. this could potentially lead to the identification of targets for diagnosing and treating diseases.

while the starrrt, exonic and intronic gene set enrichment results show a very high degree of overlap, we also note some differences between the enrichment signatures. the calcium signaling pathway was the most enriched kegg pathway for starrrt strs but is only mildly enriched in the exonic and intronic gene sets. in particular, strs were significantly enriched in the regulatory region of genes involved in the calcium signaling pathway , calcium ion binding  and ion transport and activity . intracellular calcium signaling regulates a plethora of cellular processes including apoptosis, gene transcription, proliferation, cell cycle progression and differentiation  <cit> . disruption is associated with a number of diseases such as alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, skin disorders, cardiac disease and cancer  <cit> . previous studies have shown strs can impact calcium signaling with the identification of an expansion in the cag repeat in exon  <dig> of isoforms ‘a’ and ‘c’ of kcnn <dig> and the 5’-utr of isoform ‘b’ of kcnn <dig>  which encodes a calcium activated potassium channel  <cit> . the expanded variant of kcnn <dig> has been reported to reduce channel conductance and is associated with better cognitive performance of individuals with schizophrenia  <cit> . an enriched presence of strs in the regulatory region of the calcium signaling machinery has not previously been reported and may have significant consequences for protein expression and function and consequently disease. further, the second most enriched kegg pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor  signaling, is associated with vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. we note that only starrrt genes were enriched for expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle and in the ipa analysis, cardiovascular system development and function was listed as the most enriched physiological system .

the gsea findings are consistent with mechanisms of human evolution. due to their inherent instability, the presence of variable strs in regulatory regions may act as a flexible switch to allow ready adaptation through positive selection with implications for human evolution and disease. the enrichment of neural processes and pathways is concordant with the involvement of trs in the evolution of cognition and behaviour  <cit> , supporting the idea of legendre et al.  that repeats may play a role in the swift evolution of the primate brain. the over-representation of starrrt genes involved in transcriptional regulation  further supports a role for strs in evolutionary mechanisms, given the suggested role for polymorphic trs in modifying transcription and leading to rapid evolutionary changes  <cit> . haygood et al.  surveyed base substitution rates in human genomic regions upstream of the tss and compared these with neighbouring intronic sequence and also substitution rates in chimpanzees. high rates of base substitution  in human, but not chimpanzee promoters, were observed in genes involved in neuronal function, development, glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding, vision, oncogenesis and anion transport  <cit> . this list of enriched biological processes shows much resemblance with the current study. therefore, we hypothesise that the set of enriched starrrt strs is reflective of general positive selection in human promoter regions since our divergence from chimpanzees.

the importance of strs has been recognised due to their abundance in the human genome, high mutation rates, and relevance to disease phenotypes and evolutionary processes. as technologies improve and analysis of repetitive sequences becomes simpler and more cost effective, resources such as starrrt will become more valuable and commonly utilised in biological studies. further applications for the use of strs include the study of how environmental factors  affect genomic mutation rate  <cit> , which would rely upon a thorough understanding of the baseline mutation rates and other characteristics of strs in the human genome.

CONCLUSIONS
starrrt acts as a starting point for researchers interested in looking at the role of strs in promoter regions throughout the human genome. it is publically available and can be accessed at http://www.newcastleinnovationhealth.com.au/starrrt. this resource is suitable for researchers with limited bioinformatics experience who are interested in specific strs, genes or phenotypes. multiple database identifiers are available in starrrt including affymetrix array probeset identifiers which allow legacy gene expression data to be easily mapped to this table.

this paper presents the findings from investigations of the distribution and abundance of strs in the 5’ regulatory region of human genes. we have identified a unique signature of str enrichment in this regulatory region which is most pronounced within neural genes, and calcium signaling and neurological pathways. this functional signature of str enrichment in the regulatory regions of genes is similar to that previously identified in coding regions, suggesting that regulatory region strs are subject to similar evolutionary pressures and may have an important role in gene expression. hence, this study has identified strs likely to be involved in the expression of genes associated with particular disease phenotypes and recent evolution of the human genome.
