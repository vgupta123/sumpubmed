BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stromal cells  can differentiate into chondroblasts, adipocytes or osteoblasts under appropriate stimulation  <cit> . adult human mscs  are therefore an important source for tissue repair and therapy in regenerative medicine  <cit> . expanding the osteogenic capacity of hmscs is thus of major interest for improving the osteogenic potential of hmscs for optimal bone regeneration  <cit> . the osteogenic differentiation of mscs is characterized by the expression of timely expressed genes such as runx <dig>  alkaline phosphatase  and type i collagen  followed by extracellular matrix mineralization  <cit> . several hormonal and local factors were shown to promote the osteogenic differentiation of mscs in vitro. notably, short term treatment with dexamethasone was found to induce the expression of osteoblast phenotypic genes in mscs  <cit> . unfortunately, glucocorticoids cannot be use therapeutically to promote msc differentiation because of their long term negative impact on osteoblast recruitment and function  <cit> . therefore, identifying genes that are induced by dexamethasone and are involved in the osteogenic differentiation of human mscs may help to promote their ability to differentiate into cells of the osteoblast lineage.

here, we used microarray analysis to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying msc osteoblast differentiation and enhance the osteogenic potential of human mscs. we report here that dexamethasone induces the expression of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> and show that this effect triggers osteoblast differentiation in human mscs. we also show that this effect is mediated by integrin alpha <dig>  expression and signalling. our data reveal that crosstalks between these signalling molecules are important mechanisms that trigger osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells.

RESULTS
igf2/igfbp <dig> expression is upregulated during osteoblast differentiation of mscs
short term treatment with dexamethasone is known to promote osteogenic differentiation in primary hmscs  <cit> . using this differentiating system, we performed a microarray analysis in order to gain insights into the genes that mediate the promoting effect of dexamethasone on msc osteoblast differentiation. to this goal, total rna from dexamethasone-treated and untreated mscs were collected in three different hmsc cultures and used for microarray hybridizations using hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays consisting of  <dig>  probesets, as described in our original study  <cit> . analysis of the normalized microarray data revealed that there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probe sets identified when selected for a fold change > <dig> in dexamethasone-treated mscs compared to control mscs at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively. in this follow up study, a sub-selection was made based on the common expression obtained from three different donors and networks identified by the ingenuity software. the analysis of normalized data in the three studies showed that two related molecules, namely igf <dig> and igfbp <dig>  as well as itga <dig> were commonly upregulated in dexamethasone-treated mscs compared to control mscs at days  <dig> and  <dig> . igf <dig> and igfbp <dig>  but not itga <dig> remained upregulated at  <dig> days in dexamethasone-treated mscs . analysis of gene network using ingenuity indicated that the increased expression of igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> and itga <dig> was inter-related . validation experiments using taqman low-density array with two separate experiments using mrna from two different donors confirmed that igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> and itga <dig> mrna levels were increased by more than 2-fold in dexamethasone-treated mscs compared to control cells, thus validating the microarray analysis . furthermore, the increased expression of these genes was associated with osteoblast differentiation of hmscs, as shown by the increased expression of the osteoblast phenotypic genes runx <dig>  alp and col1a <dig> . these results indicate that dexamethasone-induced osteoblast differentiation in mscs is consistently associated with increased expression of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> together with itga <dig> in human mscs.

igf2/igfbp <dig> promotes human mscs osteogenic differentiation
given the above results, we hypothesized that igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> may be involved in msc osteoblast differentiation. to investigate the potential role of these molecules on hmsc osteoblast differentiation, several differentiation assays were conducted. we first analysed the effect of igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> and their combination on alp activity, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. a dose dependent effect revealed that igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> increased alp activity at the dose of  <dig> and  <dig>  nm, respectively, whereas higher doses had no significant effect in hmscs . we then determined the effects of effective doses of igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> and their combination on osteoblast gene expression. as shown in fig. 3b-d, we found that igf <dig> or igfbp <dig> at effective dosages increased runx <dig>  alp and col1a <dig> mrna levels in hmsc, though the combination of treatment had no additive effect. to determine whether the increased osteoblast gene expression resulted in increased in vitro osteogenesis, human mscs were cultured in an osteogenic differentiation medium, treated with igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> or their combination and extracellular matrix mineralization was determined. as shown in fig. 3e, igfbp <dig> alone or combined with igf <dig> increased extracellular matrix mineralization induced by hmscs. quantitative analysis of alizarin red staining confirmed the positive effect of igfbp <dig> alone or combined with igf <dig> on matrix mineralization . overall, these results show that igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> have a positive effect on the osteogenic differentiation program in hmscs.

itga <dig> controls igf2/igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs
our microarray analysis  revealed that igf <dig>  igbp <dig> and itga <dig> are upregulated during msc osteoblast differentiation, suggesting possible crosstalks between these molecules. given our recent data indicate that itga <dig> promotes hmscs osteoblast differentiation  <cit> , we hypothesized that itga <dig> may act on msc osteoblast differentiation in part via up-regulation of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> in mscs. to test this hypothesis, we determined whether rna interference-mediated silencing of itga <dig> expression may blunt igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. as shown in figs. 4a and 4b, silencing of itga <dig> expression using an efficient and specific shrna that decreases itga <dig> mrna by 50%  <cit>  decreased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna levels in hmscs, whereas a non relevant control shrna had no effect. silencing of integrin β <dig>  using a specific shrna also decreased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna levels in hmscs, supporting a role for the itga5/itgb <dig> complex in igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> regulation in hmscs . these results indicate that itga <dig> is involved in the regulation of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> in hmscs. to confirm this finding, hmscs were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding itga <dig> and igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna levels were determined. as shown in figs. 4c and 4d, itga <dig> overexpression in hmscs increased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna expression, confirming the positive role of itga <dig> in igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs.

we then determined whether activation of endogenous itga <dig> may be sufficient to promote igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna expression in hmscs. to this goal, we used a synthetic peptide  that binds and activates itga <dig>  <cit> . as shown in figs. 4c and 4d, the agonist peptide crretawac  markedly increased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna levels in hmscs whereas a non relevant control peptide  had no effect. to confirm that activation of itga <dig> is sufficient to promote igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expresssion, hmscs were treated with a conformation-dependent anti-α <dig> monoclonal antibody  that stimulates α5β <dig> integrin  <cit> . as shown in figs. 4c and 4d, priming itga <dig> using snaka <dig> increased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expresssion in hmscs. these results provide evidence that itga <dig> controls the expression of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig>  and that activation of itga <dig> using a specific monoclonal antibody or a peptide agonist that primes this integrin is sufficient to promote the expression of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expresssion in hmscs.

inhibition of itga5-induced signalling abrogates igf2/igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs
we then determined the signalling mechanisms underlying the promoting effect of itga <dig> on igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. integrins are known to activate various signalling pathways, including fak  <cit> . we thus hypothesized that fak and downstream signalling pathways may mediate the increased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expresssion induced by itga <dig> in hmscs. to test this hypothesis, hmscs were transfected with a specific shrna that effectively decreases fak protein level by 60%  <cit> . as shown in figs. 5a and 5b, the expresssion of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> mrna was decreased in shfak-transfected cells. furthermore, fak silencing abolished igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression induced by lv-itga <dig> or crretawac . these results reveal a key role for fak signaling in itga5-induced igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. to further investigate the role of downstream pathways, hmscs were treated with the mek inhibitor u <dig>  or wortmannin, a specific pi3k inhibitor. as shown in figs. 5c and 5d, pharmacological inhibition of mek or pi3k markedly decreased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expresssion in hmsc. these results indicate that these pathways act downstream of itga5/fak signalling to regulate igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs.

overall, the results support a mechanism by which dexamethasone-induced itga <dig> expression, or activation of itga <dig> signalling promote igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression which thereby results in activation of osteoblast gene expression in human primary mscs. this reveals that novel crosstalks between these signalling molecules are important mechanisms that trigger osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stromal cells .

discussion
finding mechanisms that trigger osteogenic differentiation of hmscs may help developing novel therapeutic approaches to promote bone formation. in this study, we demonstrate that previously unidentified crosstalks between itga <dig>  igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> are functionally involved in osteoblast differentiation of human mscs. we first established by microarray analysis that dexamethasone-induced osteoblast differentiation in hmscs is associated with up-regulation of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig>  suggesting that these molecules are involved in dexamethasone-induced osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . igf <dig> was also found to be up-regulated in dental stem cells during osteogenic differentiation  <cit> , and similar gene expression profiles of igf <dig> and bmp <dig> were reported in differentiated dental follicle cells  <cit> , suggesting an important role of igf <dig> in osteogenic differentiation. however, the actions of igfs and igfbps on osteoblastic cells are complex  <cit> . both igfs and igfbps are expressed by osteoblasts in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . igf <dig> was found to promote alp activity or collagen synthesis in differentiated osteoblasts  <cit>  and igfbp <dig> levels were shown to increase during osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . however, little is known on the role of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> in the early stages of osteoblastogenesis. we show here that igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> are functionally involved in the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells. indeed, we found that igf2/igfbp <dig> at low doses increased the expression of osteoblast phenotypic genes and in vitro osteogenic capacity of hmscs. the previously unrecognised positive role of igf2/igfbp <dig> on osteogenic differentiation of hmscs in vitro suggests that these molecules may be anabolic in vivo. this is supported by the finding that subcutaneous administration of igf2/igfbp <dig> stimulates bone formation and prevents bone loss in osteopenic rats  <cit> . a positive role for igfbp <dig> in bone formation and trabecular bone acquisition has also been reported in mice  <cit> . this anabolic effect is consistent with the recent finding that igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> levels and bone formation are increased in patients with osteosclerosis linked to hepatitis c  <cit> . the present study revealing that igf2/igfbp <dig> triggers human msc osteoblast differentiation provides one cellular mechanism that may account for the positive effect of igf2/igfbp <dig> on osteoblastogenesis and bone formation.

several lines of evidence point to functional links between igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> and itga <dig> in hmscs. first, we found that itga <dig> silencing reduced igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression. second, we showed that itga <dig> overexpression up-regulated igf <dig> and igfbp <dig>  indicating that itga <dig> acts upstream of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> in hmscs. third, specific activation of itga <dig> using an anti-itga <dig> monoclonal antibody that primes the integrin, or a peptide that acts as an itga <dig> agonist promoted igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs, further demonstrating that itga <dig> signalling plays a key role in the regulation of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> in hmscs. integrins have been previously found to interact with igfbp <dig> in cancer cells  <cit> . whether itga <dig> may directly interact with igfbp <dig> to trigger cell signalling and osteogenic differentiation in hmscs is an interesting possibility that remains to be determined. one mechanism by which itga <dig> may activate igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs is via activation of signalling pathways that are activated by itga <dig>  interestingly, our data showed that fak, erk1/ <dig> and pi3k that are all activated by itga <dig>  <cit>  mediate the increased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. these data provide novel mechanisms by which activation of itga <dig> and downstream fak, erk1/ <dig> and pi3k signalling upregulates autocrine igf2/igfbp <dig> expression and thereby promotes osteoblast differentiation in human mesenchymal stromal cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identifies a sequence of molecular mechanisms by which itga <dig> expression or activation and downstream activation of fak, erk1/ <dig> and pi3k signalling induce igf2/igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. furthermore, this study reveals novel crosstalks between itga <dig> and igf2/igfbp <dig> signalling that converge to induce osteoblast differentiation in hmscs . these mechanisms may help designing novel therapeutic strategies for promoting the osteogenic differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stromal cells.
