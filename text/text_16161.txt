BACKGROUND
 <dig> - <dig> -β-glucans are polysaccharides, components of the cell walls of higher members of the poaceae family. they areparticularly abundant in the endosperm cell walls of commercially valuable cereals such as barley, rye, sorghum, oats and wheat  <cit> . structurally, these polysaccharides are linear glucans of up to  <dig>  β-d-glucosyl residues linked through β- <dig>  and β- <dig>  glycosyl bonds. variations in the proportions of β- <dig> - and β- <dig> -linkages, and in the length of the mixed-linked segments are currrently reported  <cit> . during malt production, partial hydrolysis of barley β-glucans begins with seed germination  <cit> . however, the endogenous  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanases are heat inactivated, and the remaining high molecular weight β-glucans may cause severe problems such as increased brewer mash viscosity and turbidity <cit> . increased viscosity impairs pumping and filtration, causing lower efficiency, reduced yields of extracts, and lower filtration rates, as well as the appearance of gelatinous precipitates in the finished beer  <cit> . thus, both the level of glucan-hydrolysing activities achieved during germination and the amounts of their substrates, mainly  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucan, are important factors in the production of high quality malts. addition of exogenous  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanases to the mash could therefore be an outstanding option for improving the brewing process. however, the β-glucanases currently marketed do not really meet the brewing industry's needs, mainly due to economic factors. novel  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanases with uncommon features would be highly desirable. here we report on the production, purification and partial characterization of a  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by r. microsporus var. microsporus, considering as well its potential for use in the brewing industry.

RESULTS
enzyme production
a  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucan-degrading filamentous fungus was isolated from a malt silo in a brewery. this zygomycete microfungus was identified as rhizopus microsporus var. microsporus by rcdna analysis. it grew strongly in liquid medium containing chitin as the sole carbon source, and produced substantial amounts of β-glucanase activity  which was able to fully hydrolyze barley β-glucan . the specificity of substrate hydrolysis by this enzyme  fully supports the assumption that it belongs to the  <dig> . <dig>  category. the inducible nature of  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase production has already been reported for  <dig> -β-glucanase from trichoderma sp.  <cit> . although cellulose and xylan were also inducers, the levels of enzyme secreted in the presence of these carbohydrates were considered smaller than the activity induced by chitin. in cultures grown under agitation  at 40°c, the enzyme activity increased from a minimum to a maximum level within 24h of growth. it has been reported that several other microrganisms, including bacillus sp.  <cit> trichoderma sp.  <cit> , talaromyces emersonii  <cit> , and rhizobium sp.  <cit> , produce  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase enzymes which are currently used in the brewing industry. however, depending on the substrate  used as inducer, production of the glucanases for industrial application may be very costly, to the point of being considered economically prohibitive  <cit> . chitin, on the other hand, is a relatively cheap and readily available carbon source in comparison to barley β-glucan and laminarin. the ability, therefore, of r. microsporus var. microsporus to produce  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase in the presence of chitin, favors its use on an industrial scale.

enzyme purification
the culture supernatant of r. microsporus var. microsporus grown in liquid medium containing chitin was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration, using a  <dig> kda cut-off membrane. no  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase activity was found in the filtrate. chromatography of the concentrate on a sephacryl s- <dig> gel filtration column  followed by chromatography on an sp-sepharose ion exchange column resulted in elution of two peaks of proteins  . while the pgi proteins were inactive, the pgii protein  showed substantial activity against  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucan. a summary of the purification steps of the  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by the r. microsporus var. microsporus is shown in table  <dig>  the enzyme was purified   <dig> -fold with a yield of  <dig> % and a specific activity of  <dig>  u.mg- <dig>  the molecular mass of the pgii protein was  <dig>  kda, as indicated by sds-page analysis . this value is comparable to that  determined by mass spectrometry analysis for this enzyme . while  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanases from bacillus sp. have smaller molecular masses varying in the range of 25– <dig> kda  <cit> , the enzymes from clostridium thermocellum   <cit> , bacteroides succinogenes   <cit>  and talaromyces emersonii   <cit>  showed comparable molecular mass values.

enzyme specificity
the r. microsporus purified β-glucanase was tested for its ability to hydrolyze several other glucan substrates. as may be seen in table  <dig>  only the barley β-glucan was efficiently hydrolyzed, as indicated by the much higher net absorbance. in comparison to the activity against the  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucan, very low or no activity at all was shown by the enzyme against the substrates laminarin  and cm-cellulose , indicating clearly that the enzyme may be taken as a member of the ec  <dig> . <dig>  enzyme category.

effect of ph and temperature optima
the effect of ph and temperature on the activity of the purified  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase from rhizopus microsporus var. microsporus is shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. at 50°c, the enzyme showed substantial activity in the ph range of from  <dig> to  <dig>  maximal activity was recorded in the range of from  <dig> to  <dig>  no enzyme activity was detected at ph higher than  <dig> . at ph  <dig> , the purified enzyme was substantially active in the temperature range from 20°c to 65°c. maximal activity was detected at 50°c and 60°c, indicating that the optimal temperature for glucan hydrolysis is 55°c . the optima ph and temperature values determined for the purified  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase from r. microsporus var. microsporus were similar to those determined for  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanases from several other fungi and bacteria  <cit> . in addition, these values are comparable to those presented by enzymes currently being used in the brewing industry  <cit> . the purified  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase retained 100% and 87% of its activity after incubation for  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, at 50°c. the half-lives of the enzyme at the temperatures of 60°c and 70°c were found to be  <dig> min and  <dig> min, respectively. at 50°c, the half-life was  <dig> h . for hydrolysis of β-glucan by a novel  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by bacillus halodurans c- <dig>  the ph optimum was between  <dig> and  <dig>  and the temperature optimum was 60°c. after  <dig> h incubation at 50°c and 60°c, the residual activity remained 100% and 50%, respectively. the enzymatic activity was abolished after  <dig> min incubation at 70°c. the optimum temperature for hydrolysis of lichenan by a  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase from bacteroides succinogenes at ph  <dig>  was 50°c  <cit> .

effect of metal ions
the effect of several ions on the activity of the purified  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by r. microsporus var. microsporus is shown in table  <dig>  the enzyme was sensitive to copper and fairly sensitive to zinc and manganese, but insensitive to magnesium, calcium and aluminum . glucanases produced by rhizopus oryzae  <cit> , bacillus clausii  <cit> , bacillus halodurans  <cit>  and trichoderma harzianum  <cit>  show similar sensitivity to the divalent metal ion copper.

kinetic parameters
the purified  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by r. microsporus var. microsporus hydrolyzed  <dig>  –  <dig> -β-glucan in a michaelis-menten fashion . kinetic parameters were calculated using a michaelis-menten plot with a non-linear regression data analysis program  <cit> . values of  <dig>  mg.ml- <dig>   <dig> s- <dig> and  <dig>  u.ml- <dig> were determined for km, kcat and vmax, respectively. km values of  <dig>  –  <dig>  mg.ml- <dig> for hydrolysis of barley β-glucan and  <dig>  –  <dig> mg.ml- <dig> for lichenan were reported for the  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by bacillus sp  <cit> . values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig> were reported for kcat , km  and kcat/km  respectively, for hydrolysis of lichenan by a  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by bacteroides succinogenes.  <cit> .

capillary viscosimetry and filtration rate
the specific filtration rate and specific viscosity rate of the mash after incubation with the  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase from r. microsporus var microsporus were compared with those values calculated for two commercial β-glucanases currently used in the brewing industry. the results are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  even at lower enzyme concentration, the  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase from r. microsporus var microsporus caused a higher reduction in the filtration rate  of the mash . similar results were obtained for the specific viscosity of the brewer's mash after treatment with the three β-glucanases .

CONCLUSIONS
the zygomycete rhizopus microsporus var. microsporus produced a  <dig> - <dig> -β-d-glucan 4-glucanhydrolase  which could hydrolyze β-d-glucan substrate containing both  <dig> - and  <dig> -bonds. its molecular mass as determined by both electrophoresis and mass spectrometry  was about  <dig>  kda. its optimum ph and temperature were found to be in the ranges of 4– <dig> and 50–60°c, respectively. kinetic analysis and its capacity to reduce both the viscosity of the brewer mash and the filtration time, indicate the possibility to use this enzyme in the brewing industry.
