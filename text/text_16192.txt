BACKGROUND
oomycetes are a group of filamentous, unicellular heterokonts. they are fungus-like in their growth form, adsorptive and parasitic lifestyles and formation of spores, but are relatively closely related to photosynthetic algae such as brown algae and diatoms  <cit> . among oomycetes, also known as water molds, there are economically important pathogens that comprise severe pests, like phytophthora infestans  <cit>  causing potato late blight, a. euteiches causing seedling blight or legumes root rot  <cit> , a. astaci  <cit> , - the causative agent of crayfish plague, and several fish pathogens from the genera aphanomyces  <cit> , achlya and saprolegnia  <cit> . there is also at least one species with zoonotic potential, namely pythium insidiosum - the etiologic agent of the human disease pythiosis insidiosii, which can be life-threatening  <cit> . the oomycetes a. astaci and phytophthora cinnamomi are listed among the world's  <dig> worst invasive species .

the crayfish plague, representing the most severe disease among asian, australian, and european crayfish species, is caused by the oomycete a. astaci . crayfish plague-associated die-offs in austrian waters were first reported in  <dig>  <cit>  and in the 1920s  <cit> , and continue sporadically into the present. an estimated 80% of all native austrian crayfish populations disappeared in the 20th century . a high percentage of these die-offs are associated with crayfish plague, which represents one of the major threats to the recovery of populations of native crayfish species in central europe  <cit> . for example, astacus astacus, formerly a very abundant species in europe, is now considered threatened by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources   <cit> . in many countries this economically valuable crayfish is on the red list and its current harvest is probably less than 10% of the harvest rate before introduction of the crayfish-plague pathogen  <cit> . a. astaci was introduced from north america, where various species harbour the pathogen without showing clinical signs of infection. crayfish-plague outbreaks among such populations often occur only under stress conditions. the introduction of resistant north american species like the signal crayfish , the red-swamp crayfish  and the spiny-cheek crayfish  http://www.issg.org/database has established a permanent reservoir for the pest in europe. the transmission of the pathogen occurs via crayfish cadavers, crayfish-feeding fish  <cit> , fish scales  <cit>  and all kinds of equipment, which have been in contact with contaminated water  <cit> . the adaptive life style, high fecundity, and resistance to the pathogen make introduced crayfish species a potent bioinvador and the most dangerous vector for pathogen transmission.

biflagellated secondary zoospores, measuring  <dig> ×  <dig> μm, represent the infective unit of a. astaci. they target host tissue by various mechanisms including chemotaxis  <cit>  on soft parts of the crayfish integument, especially at the joints, the bottom side of the abdomen and even near the eyestalks  <cit>  as well as fresh wounds  <cit> . once zoospores reach the upper lipoprotein-layer of the crayfish cuticle, they discard their flagellae, and develop a penetration peg, that weakens the lipid layer enzymatically  <cit> . soon after the germ tube has penetrated the cuticle by mechanical force, the developing hyphae begin to secrete chitinases and proteases  <cit> . in this phase different chitinases  <cit>  jointly degrade chitin polymers in order to release nutrients and facilitate further growth mainly parallel to the chitin fibrils of the endocuticula  <cit> . based on their substrate affinity these enzymes can be classified into three groups:  endochitinases, which randomly cleave glycosidic linkages, generating free ends and long chitooligosaccharides that are processed by  exochitinases , which release diacetylchitobiose  and  n-acetylglucosaminidases , which hydrolyse chitobiose or release n-acetylglucosamine monomer from chitin chains  <cit> .

high-level production of extracellular chitinase in the absence of substrate is one of the most prominent features of the specialised crayfish-parasite a. astaci  <cit> . the gh <dig> family-chitinase chi <dig> was the first chitinase described for a. astaci  <cit> . here we selected two additional members of this gene family as targets for an a. astaci-specific diagnostic assay. gh <dig> chitinases can be divided into three clusters, two of which  differentiated before the appearance of the eukaryotic lineage  <cit> . for example, fungal gh <dig> families comprise between one and twenty genes represented by members of all three clusters  <cit> . we demonstrate the temporally regulated expression of two novel members of the a. astaci-gh <dig> family. this functional constraint was regarded as a basic criterion for the development of a closed-tube diagnostic method for qualitative and quantitative detection of a. astaci. in conclusion, simultaneously targeting multiple chitinase sequences including the novel, functionally constrained chitinase sequences, facilitates a robust analysis of clinical samples with a maximum reduced chance of false-negative detection.

RESULTS
strain identification
two putative a. astaci strains were recovered from healthy signal crayfish in two small streams in the austrian province of burgenland . a third strain  was isolated from the subabdominal cuticle of a moribund noble crayfish specimen collected during an acute crayfish-plague outbreak in the lake „gleinkersee”  in march  <dig> . its-sequence data and constitutive chitinase secretion specific for a. astaci  confirm the assumed species assignment for all three strains. the strain gb <dig> was used to identify two new chitinase genes, test for their functional constraint and finally to develop the diagnostic assay for a. astaci.

the aphanomyces strain lk <dig> was isolated from a healthy signal crayfish . physiological and genetic evidence showed that the strain does not fit into any previously identified group of a. astaci. it exhibited properties like repeated zoospore emergence and lack of sexual reproduction commonly associated with parasitic species. in contrast to a. astaci, the strain lk <dig> does not express chitinase constitutively during growth or sporulation. phylogenetic analysis of its sequences  demonstrated clustering within the a. laevis-repetans clade  <cit> . in addition, a blastn search with the 28srdna sequence of lk <dig>  showed close homology to a. laevis , but clear difference  to the a. astaci strains hö, fdl, gb <dig> and z <dig> . until their taxonomic status is fully elucidated the new isolate was assigned to a. repetans. this species is not capable of killing crayfish following standardised experimental infection and is characterised by a high growth rate, and germination in response to nutrients  <cit> .

sequence determination of the novel a. astaci genes chi <dig> and chi3
fungal species contain one to twenty gh <dig> chitinase family genes  <cit> . in order to develop a robust diagnostic assay for a. astaci, we asked whether the chitinolytic system of the pathogen would contain multiple genes of this ancient gene family widely expressed in archea, prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> .

as indicated by the two cross-reacting bands detected in western-blot analysis with antibodies raised against the catalytic gh <dig> domain, a. astaci contains more than one chitinase-like protein . therefore, we attempted to identify homologous genes using pcr amplification with consensus primers targeting the amino acid motifs dswnd and agsw . for various a. astaci strains representing all four genotype groups described  and the austrian strain gb <dig> isolated in this work , partial gh <dig> domain sequences were amplified and subsequently sequenced. analysis revealed a mixture of sequences derived from two new chitinase genes , as concluded by retrospective evaluation. only synonymous substitutions were found in these genes . starting from the consensus sequence obtained for the "core" of chi <dig> and chi <dig> mrnas, their complete mrna sequences were identified by rapid amplification of cdna ends -pcr and submitted to the genbank .

genomic dna amplified with gene specific primers designed near the start and stop codons of chi <dig> and chi <dig>  yielded fragments of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for chi <dig> and chi <dig>  respectively. subsequent sequence analysis performed with a primer-walking strategy  confirmed the absence of the consensus sequence for exon-intron junctions  and identity of cdna and genomic sequences .

characterization of cdna and deduced amino acid sequences of chi <dig> and chi3
without the poly tail, the cdna sequences of chi <dig> and chi <dig> measure  <dig> and 1591-bp in length and exhibit a relatively high guanine and cytosine base content of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, a typical feature of oomycete genes  <cit> . chi <dig> and chi <dig> code for open reading frames of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids  with molecular masses of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda and isoelectric points of ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  predicted for the mature secreted enzymes chi <dig> and chi <dig> , respectively. the mrnas possess an identical 42-bp 5' untranslated region  carrying the major part of the oomycete consensus sequence for the start site of transcription . the 3' utrs of chi <dig> and chi <dig> contain the polyadenylation signal wauaac   <cit>  . in both genes the translation start codon is part of the eukaryotic consensus accatga  <cit> . the enzymes are predicted to be cleaved by signal peptidase between positions a <dig> and a <dig> producing a hydrophobic signal peptide of  <dig> amino acids .

overall, the deduced amino acid sequences of chi <dig> and chi <dig> are highly homologous with an identity of up to  <dig> % . the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich domain  <cit>  of chi <dig> contains extra residues resulting in an extended amino acid sequence of the whole protein compared to chi <dig> . this domain also represents the most heterologous part of the enzymes regarding primary sequence. chi <dig> and chi <dig> possess an oomycete-type catalytic gh <dig> domain . it contains a conserved chitin-binding  site  <cit>  , and an active site consensus  -  - g -  -  -  -  - x - e  being variant at one position . the catalytic-site residues d <dig>  d <dig> and e <dig> are putatively required for catalytic activity  <cit> . a second putative, highly homologous cb site was identified in the c-terminal part of the chitinases . it contains four cysteines, instead of the five residues found in a diatom chitinase  or six in most insect chitinases  <cit> .

chi <dig> and chi <dig> sequences contain sites for amidation, n-myristoylation or o-linked glycosylation . the latter type of glycosylation predicted for the c-terminal protein parts occurs often at serine and threonine residues that would otherwise be phosphorylated; one illustration of the complex interplay among eukaryotic post-translational modification systems  <cit> . n-glycosylation at n165/ <dig>  and n296/ <dig>  was predicted for chi2/chi <dig>  respectively. these posttranslational modifications may account for the discrepant masses deduced from primary protein sequences and calculated on the basis of the electrophoretic mobility . putative sites for c-linked glycosylation  were not found. the tripeptide 'rgd' mediating cell adhesion  was predicted for chi <dig>  potential sites for phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine residues are listed in the additional file  <dig> 

temporal mrna expression analysis for chi <dig> and chi3
next, we verified that target genes selected for the dna-based diagnostic crayfish-plague assay are subject to functional constraint. this could be assumed if temporal expression of target genes significantly changes during physiological conditions relevant to the infection in vivo.

the chi <dig> and chi <dig> mrna copy numbers expressed in the a. astaci mycelium, grown in chitin-free culture were quantified over three days at intervals of twelve hours using one-step qrt-pcr. a partial sequence of the nuclear gene ndufv <dig> encoding the mitochondrial protein nadh dehydrogenase  flavoprotein  <dig>  which is part of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i, was identified in this work . we used this sequence as target for an endogenous positive control qrt-pcr assay reporting deviations in extraction, reverse transcription and pcr amplification including mrna integrity, quality, and quantity. overall, levels of ndufv <dig> mrna changed only slightly across the time points studied , including, however, expression changes which were near or below the level of significance  but not matching the temporal expression patterns of the chitinases. in detail, the dynamic growth of the mycelium during the first hours in drop culture  was reflected by the higher ndufv <dig> expression found after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of culture . mycelium growth reached its plateau after  <dig> hours of incubation. the decreasing energy requirement and the beginning of autolytic processes at this stage are reflected by a lower ndufv1-transcript copy number .

the chitinase genes chi <dig> and chi <dig> were both constitutively expressed in mycelium grown in a medium lacking the substrate chitin. however, different mrna amounts and temporal expression patterns, including the time point at which the maximum level was reached, were observed . most prominent was the significant maximum in the chi <dig> mrna level reached after  <dig> hours .

analogous to data obtained for chi <dig>  <cit> , we demonstrated, exemplarily for chi <dig>  that neither the amplitude of expression nor its pattern was influenced by substrate addition .

assay development for qualitative and quantitative detection of a. astaci in clinical samples based on chitinase gene sequences
compared to other crayfish-afflicting oomycetes, permanent chitinase expression and activity represents a unique feature of a. astaci  <cit> . due to the assumed functional constraints demonstrated by the significant alterations of temporal gene expression , its chitinolytic system was chosen as a target for the development of a diagnostic test.

qpcr/mca
a blastp search with the deduced amino acid sequence of chi <dig> as query identified two conserved motifs within the gh <dig> chitinase domain . the nucleotide sequences of these motifs were used as target sites for the design of degenerated pcr primers. using these primers we were able to amplify and sequence the homologous sequences of nine strains from eight oomycete species and two fungi which are known to live on or in proximity of crayfish . on the basis of these sequences, we designed a diagnostic primer pair producing a  <dig> bp-amplicon from each of the three related chitinase genes . its melting temperature of  <dig> °c in mca was regarded as criterion for identification of an a. astaci strain. for assay robustness the chitinase primer pair was multiplexed with primers targeting the  <dig> s rrna gene as an endogenous control  and yielding a peak in mca at  <dig>  to  <dig> °c depending from the species investigated.

the qpcr/mca assay was tested for specificity against the oomycetes a. frigidophilus, a. invadans, a. laevis, a. helicoides, a. irregularis, and leptolegnia caudata. only the endogenous control was recorded, but not the a. astaci-specific chitinase peak.

qpcr/mca-based detection of a. astaci was used to elucidate several spontanous crayfish mortalities in austrian waterbodies. in detail, a. astaci was identified as causative agent of acute crayfish-plague outbreaks among noble crayfish inhabiting a small unnamed pond-system , in the noble crayfish-pond bäckerteich , in the brook hahntrattenbach near st. andrä  known for its large stone crayfish population and in a noble crayfish population of the lake gleinkersee . a. astaci was also detected by mca in necrobiopsy pools each derived from up to five euthanised signal crayfish specimens collected at the streams ganaubach, zöbernbach, strem, tauchenbach and güns . clinical samples tested positive by mca were subjected to pathogen isolation. in case of isolation failure the qpcr/mca amplicon was sequenced.

taqman qpcr
for sensitive detection of the pathogen, but also for quantification of agent levels in susceptible crayfish and carrier crayfish, a taqman-probe-based qpcr assay was developed. taqman qpcr uses the same primers as qpcr/mca except the additional nucleotide at the very 5' end of the reverse primer compared to qpcr/mca. using amplicon standards with known copy numbers spiked into genomic crayfish dna, a quantitative detection limit of  <dig> target sequences was determined . no amplication, i.e. ct >  <dig>  was obtained for a. frigidophilus, a. invadans, a. leaevis and a. irregularis, in the case of the oomycete species a. helicoides and leptolegnia caudata a cross-amplification signal corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> copies was detected, respectively.

discussion
qualitative detection of two or multiple target sequences by mca has been reported before. single-tube snp genotyping  <cit> , sex determination  <cit> , identification of methylation in promoter sequences  <cit>  or the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens  <cit>  are exemplarily mentioned.

in this work we have used mca of multiplex qpcr  <cit>  for rapid species identification of the crayfish-plague pathogen a. astaci in a closed-tube format. the diagnostic assay for qualitative detection is highly discriminative, robust, inexpensive, and reliable.

high discrimination was aimed at since new aphanomyces its sequences, probably representing new aphanomyces spp. and including sequences closely related to a. astaci were reported  <cit> . current molecular techniques for a. astaci detection based on its sequences suffer from a lack of specificity , or are laborious and time-consuming due to agarose electrophoresis and subsequent amplicon sequence analysis  <cit> . to facilitate unambiguous species identification, we considered the unique feature of constitutive chitinase gene expression of a. astaci, not found in closely related aphanomyces species  <cit> . in a search for additional gh <dig> family members the novel chitinase genes chi <dig> and chi <dig> were identified in this work. the genes differ in their 3' utrs including variant putative polyadenylation signals. their temporal mrna expressions change differently during mycelium growth in chitin-free medium. the deduced extracellular protein sequences are different in proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich domain size, and either possess or lack a putative cell attachement site. this speaks in favour of a joint action during the infection process. therefore, we regarded chi <dig> and chi <dig> as different members of the gh <dig> gene family rather than allelic sequences. altogether, three genes  encoding constitutively expressed gh <dig> chitinases in the absence of chitin were identified as unique characteristics of a. astaci and selected as targets for species-specific detection.

assay robustness, characterised by a low risk of false negatives related to genotypic variation of pathogenic strains, was another issue for assay design. this was especially important since a. astaci belongs to the group of asexual organisms, for which a low level of genetic variation turns out to be the exception rather than the rule  <cit> . we argued that targeting one or even several functionally constrained sequences would restrict the genotypic variations allowed. the novel chitinase genes chi <dig> and chi <dig> being functionally constrained as concluded from their significant changes in temporal mrna expression during growth  were regarded to be appropriate candidates to achieve this aim. together with the first member of the gh <dig> gene family of a. astaci  they served as targets in the diagnostic assays based on qpcr/mca or taqman qpcr. in the qpcr/mca-based assay for qualitative detection, a further level of robustness was achieved by multiplexing with a primer pair targeting the  <dig> s rrna gene as an endogenous control. this dna sequence is naturally present at multiple copies  <cit>  and harbours two completely homologous primer target sites in each experimental oomycete species . the simultaneous amplification of this  <dig> s rrna sequence controling for the dna extraction and amplification steps reduces the chance of false negative detection due to insufficient sample quality. the chitinase gene targets and the endogenous control can be considered to be present at comparable copy numbers  <cit> . therefore, if non-limited primer concentrations are applied like here, the simultaneous amplification of more than one target in a single pcr, i.e. multiplexing, leads to competition between multiple targets for a finite number of reagents. representing a welcomed side effect, this further enhances assay discrimination . co-amplification of an endogenous control adds another level to assay robustness and represents an improvement compared to the its1-based taqman minor-groove binder qpcr assay for a. astaci-detection reported recently  <cit> . coextraction of an homologous  internal positive control  with the clinical samples and coamplification in the qpcr or qpcr/mca assays with the same primers used for the target dna ensures accurate control of the entire molecular assay and represents the state of the art for internal controls. it was shown that the addition of an ipc at levels resulting in  <dig> copies per pcr did not affect the amplification of the target sequence  <cit> . a competitive ipc compatible with the qpcr/mca and taqman qpcr assays developed in this work is presented as additional file  <dig> 

another level of diagnostic uncertainty in the assay developed for a. astaci detection  <cit>  is added by the use of a synthetic amplicon mimicking one of the closest relatives, a. frigidophilus. this approach supposes the intragenomic homogeneity of the its regions which has already been rebutted in many organisms  <cit> . the addition of a minor-groove binder to a taqman probe in the assay reported by vralstad et al. allows to use shorter probes. however, probe cost increases by about  <dig> -fold compared to our conventional taqman qpcr designed for quantitative detection. it also elevates the chance of detection failure when varying genotypes are present. generally, the avoidance of false negatives represents a major challenge in molecular diagnostics. particularly, in taqman qpcr assays the possibility of false-negative testing poses a substantial problem because mutations within the probe-binding site can prevent annealing of the probe and subsequent detection  <cit> . for example, taqman qpcr failed to detect any target with more than two mutations at the probe-binding site in contrast to a dye-based assay  <cit> . the dilemma of false-negative detection due to probe-binding site variation can be overcome, for example, by combining a dna probe with a fluorescent, double-stranded dna-binding dye for specific nucleic acid quantification by probe-based qpcr and mca  <cit> . in this case the dye would report a detection failure if the probe-binding site of a clinical specimen is mutated. however, "compensation" for mutations in the probe-binding site is no longer an issue if only two instead of three regions of conserved sequence are required for assay design as in the dye-based qpcr/mca developed in this work. if very limited prior target sequence information exists from a population of interest like in our case, a dye-based detection approach represents a favourable strategy for species confirmation.

a welcomed side effect of dye- instead of probe-mediated monitoring is the cost reduction for screening clinical samples.

last but not least, the reliability of the diagnostic assay was proven on a set of relevant related pathogens and during an acute crayfish-plague outbreak in the small, noble crayfish  population inhabiting the lake "gleinkersee" located at an altitude of about  <dig> meters above sea level at the foothills of the austrian alps. in addition to qpcr/mca typing , the presence of the pathogen a. astaci was independently confirmed by its-sequence analysis and testing for constitutive chitinase activity . finally, the a. astaci strain gks <dig> was isolated on pg- <dig> agar from an infected noble crayfish. numerous crayfish individuals were found to be affected but were still alive during the outbreak of late march  <dig>  at that time the ice of the lake gleinkersee was melting and the physiological activities of both pathogen and victim would have been expected to be at a minimum. these circumstances strongly indicated the acuteness of the outbreak. the suspicion of a deliberate introduction of the pathogen could not be confirmed by an inquiry led by the local criminal investigation department. fish stocking performed in autumn  <dig> may be the most likely source of disease transmission.

sensitive quantitative detection of the crayfish-plague pathogen is currently of increasing importance for screening natural non-native crayfish populations or for certifying a pathogen-free status of hatchery fish before introduction into natural habitats or aquaculture facilities. samples of fish transport water including sediments can be filtered via membrane filters  <cit>  and subsequently screened by taqman qpcr . this circumvents pathogen transmission via transport water, fish faeces, mucus and scales.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of two new chitinase genes showing specific patterns of constitutive temporal expression in the absence of substrate has facilitated the development of a discriminative, robust and reliable method for qualitative and quantitative detection for a. astaci.
