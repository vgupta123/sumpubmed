BACKGROUND
olfactory receptors  are expressed on the cilial membranes of olfactory sensory neurons embedded in the olfactory mucosa  <cit> . or are transmembrane g-protein-coupled receptors and constitute the first element in a biochemical cascade leading to the perception and recognition of an odorant. or genes constitute the largest mammalian gene family, with several hundred genes in the human genome and up to  <dig> in the rat genome  <cit> . comparisons of the amino-acid sequences deduced from orthologous and paralogous or genes have shown a large number of positions to be highly conserved and others to be variable. the conserved residues are thought to be involved in signal transduction, whereas the variable residues are thought to be involved in binding thousands of odorant molecules in specific interactions  <cit> .

mammals have evolved sophisticated systems for sensing the outside world and, in particular, for sensing odorant molecules indicating danger or the presence of a mate or food. dogs are particularly interesting in this respect. they were domesticated from wolves some  <dig>  years ago and have since undergone extensive breeding and selection, resulting in  <dig> or so different breeds, some of which were developed specifically for hunting, in which olfaction plays a central role  <cit> . the astounding ability of dogs to detect an odorant molecule and follow its trace results from the interaction of several brain functions. the first step in this process involves the efficient binding of an odorant molecule to a given set of or. the absence of a particular or or the presence of alleles giving rise to or with a low binding efficiency would lead to poor downstream processing or the complete absence of such processing. as a case in point, links between nucleotide polymorphisms in two or genes in humans  and the perception of specific odorants – androstenone and isovaleric acid, respectively – have recently been demonstrated  <cit> .

we therefore wondered whether breeds or individual dogs known to be particularly skilled at odorant detection have different gene alleles encoding or with a higher affinity for their ligands or more efficient at initiating the signal transduction cascade. in a preliminary study on a subset of  <dig> or genes, we showed the rate of polymorphism to be high, with all genes having at least one snp in their open reading frame   <cit> . this finding led us to analyse the dna sequences of a larger number of or genes  in a cohort of  <dig> dogs from six breeds known to differ in their ability to detect odorants: four breeds known for their strong sense of olfaction  and two breeds known to have a weak sense of olfaction .

we show here that or genes are generally highly polymorphic, with a mean of one snp per  <dig> nucleotides. however, the degree of polymorphism observed is highly variable, with some or genes having few if any snp and others being highly polymorphic . this high level of genetic polymorphism, resulting in a large number of amino-acid substitutions in all parts of the or, strongly suggests that a large proportion of the mutations occurring during dna replication are not counter-selected, facilitating the evolution of the or repertoire and increasing its potential to recognise odorants.

methods
dna samples
dna was obtained from  <dig> dogs from six breeds: german shepherd dog , belgian malinois , labrador retriever , english springer spaniel , greyhound , pekingese . in addition, blood samples from  <dig> boxer  dogs were processed for the analysis of a subset of or genes.

most of the dna samples were obtained from the canidna bank  <cit>  and were selected from dogs with no family links up to grandparental level. we also selected dogs from different breeders from different regions or countries, to minimise possible links between animals. when necessary, the panel was completed with additional samples provided by gary s. johnson  and paul g. jones from masterfoods .

dna was extracted with the nucleospin blood l kit . for samples with low dna concentrations, whole genome amplification was carried out with the illustra genomiphi v <dig> dna amplification kit .

pcr amplification and or gene sequencing
pairs of specific primers  were designed with primer <dig>  <cit> , for binding outside the reading frame, for amplification of the whole or orf. primers were also designed to bind to regions with a unique sequence, to ensure that paralogous genes were not amplified. the nomenclature and sequences of or genes were extracted from the paper by quignon et al.  <cit>  and can be obtained from  <cit> . pcr amplification was carried out in a final volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig> ng of dog dna, geneamp  <dig> × pcr gold buffer,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> ,  <dig> μm dntp ,  <dig>  u amplitaq gold dna polymerase  and  <dig>  μm of each specific primer. pcr conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 61°c for  <dig> s with a touch-down process  and 72°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 51°c for  <dig> s, 72°c for  <dig> min, and a final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. aliquots of pcr products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in  <dig>  × tbe. we then purified  <dig>  μl of pcr products from faithful amplifications using  <dig> μl of exosap-it . the purified pcr products were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min and then at 80°c for  <dig> min. pairs of specific internal primers  designed with primer <dig>  <cit>  were used for sequencing pcr products with the bigdye v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit , used according to the manufacturer's instructions. sequencing products were fractionated on a 3130xl genetic analyser from applied biosystems.

snp identification
sequences were aligned and analysed with seqscape software v <dig>  , using the canfam <dig> dna sequence as a reference  <cit> . only snp corresponding to nucleotide sequence of the highest quality, as determined by the phred algorithm  <cit> , were retained.

data analysis
haploview software v <dig>   <cit>  was used to calculate the snp maf  and ld values. we calculated r <dig> values for or genes and d' values for clusters, making it possible to compare our results with those of previous studies  <cit> .

haplotypes
haplotypes were inferred using fastphase software v  <dig> . <dig> with the default settings  <cit> . this software estimates the missing genotypes and reconstructs haplotypes from unphased genotype data from unrelated individuals.

n value calculation
as an index of the level of or polymorphism, a mean distance n between snp was calculated, based on the number of snp detected through the pairwise comparison of all or sequences and the occurrence of the two alleles of each snp. thus, the smallest n value denotes the highest level of polymorphism.

the n value for individual or genes was calculated as follows:

 nor=/∑i=1nai⋅bi 

where n is the number of snp per or gene and a and b the occurrences of the two alleles.

the n value for the complete set of or genes was calculated with the same formula, in which n is the total number of snp and the individual orf size is replaced by the sum of individual orf sizes.

ka/ks
ka/ks was calculated for each or gene, as described by goldman and yang  <cit> , using the codeml program  from the paml package  <cit> . ka/ks for the whole set of or genes was obtained by determining mean ka/mean ks.

RESULTS
snp number and distribution
we analysed the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> or genes  selected from the entire or repertoire of  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> . these or genes were selected to be representative of a large number of families , subfamilies and clusters  located on  <dig> chromosomes . they were also selected as representative of genomic regions very rich in or genes, as for cluster @40– <dig> on canine chromosome  <dig> , or with a lower density of or genes, as for cluster @ <dig> on cfa <dig>  we also studied five isolated or genes. we determined the nucleotide sequences of pcr fragments amplified from dna purified from a cohort of  <dig> dogs of six breeds: german shepherd dog , belgian malinois , labrador retriever , english springer spaniel , greyhound  and pekingese . we also analysed a subset of  <dig> or genes in eight boxers .

visual inspection of all sequencing traces obtained with the cohort of  <dig> dogs led to the identification of  <dig> snp, corresponding to  <dig> transitions and  <dig> transversions. we also observed  <dig> short insertions/deletions  and five longer indels of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. as the occurrence of each indel probably corresponded to a single mutational event, these  <dig> mutations  were combined for further analysis. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of snp within the  <dig> or genes. it shows that all but four of the or genes are polymorphic, with one to  <dig> snp per or gene.

when analysed at the breed level, the total number of snp differed significantly  between breeds, whereas their distribution did not  . however the numbers of or genes without snp differed markedly between breeds , with  <dig> and  <dig> or genes with no snp for german shepherd dog and greyhound, respectively,  <dig> for labrador retriever and only  <dig> for each of the three other breeds. the set of or genes with no snp was either breed-specific or shared by only a few breeds, in different combinations .

numbers  refer to the number of snp per or gene and per breed. this table also highlights the range of polymorphism of certain or genes within the six breeds . this table is a subset of additional file  <dig> 

at the whole-population level, most or genes tended to be either weakly  or highly  polymorphic . however, there were several notable exceptions, with some or genes weakly polymorphic or not polymorphic in one breed and highly polymorphic in the other five breeds. this was the case for cfor <dig> , cfor <dig>  and cfor08a <dig> .

we investigated the possible correlation between or gene polymorphism and the organization of these or genes into clusters of different sizes, by ranking the  <dig> or genes according to snp content. we selected the  <dig> or genes with no more than two snp and the  <dig> or genes with  <dig> or more snp and compared the sizes of the clusters harbouring these or genes. as shown in figures  <dig>  and  <dig> , the least polymorphic or genes were preferentially localised in small clusters  and the highly polymorphic or genes, in large clusters . mann-whitney test showed this relationship to be significant . in addition, the  <dig> or genes were ranked according to cluster size and we selected the  <dig> or genes located in clusters containing five or fewer or genes and the  <dig> or genes present in the largest cluster . again, or genes in small clusters tended to be less polymorphic than or genes in large clusters  . interestingly, the or genes with the highest number of snp tended to have paralogous genes with higher sequence homology  than or genes devoid of snp or harbouring a small number of snp.

allele frequency
snp minor allele frequency  ranged from 1% to 50% . however, maf within breeds might differ considerably from maf across breeds, with some alleles absent in all but one breed, in which they could be the major allele . other examples are provided by snp  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , for which the minor alleles at the whole population level are the major alleles in one breed .

numbers correspond to the frequency of the allele identified as the minor allele in the whole population. the second allele in the snp column is always the minor allele in the whole population. as expected, the minor allele at the whole population level is also the minor allele in most breeds. exceptions in which the minor allele at the whole population level is the major allele in one breed are indicated in bold typeface. this table is a subset of additional file  <dig> 

we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> snp  identified in this study were restricted to a single breed and that their breed distribution differed significantly , with  <dig> private snp for german shepherd dog,  <dig> for belgian malinois,  <dig> for english springer spaniel,  <dig> for greyhound,  <dig> for labrador retriever and  <dig> for pekingese. conversely,  <dig> snp  were common to all breeds, whereas  <dig> were common to two breeds and  <dig> were common to three breeds .

assuming, as is most likely, that each snp appeared once in the evolutionary history of the dog, it follows that the  <dig> snp common to all breeds probably arose before the separation of the six breeds and that most of the private snp arose following breed separation. based on the same rationale, it could be hypothesised that snp common to two or three breeds arose before the separation of these breeds. although the number of pairs in common differed significantly , the use of hclust  <cit>  to construct dendrograms did not result in any clusters matching breed history. this is probably because the number of snp common to pairs of breeds with a maf > 10% was too small.

polymorphism level
nucleotide polymorphism level reflects the number of differences between two sequences. it can be represented by n, the mean distance, expressed in nucleotides, between two snp. or genes are generally highly polymorphic, but the distribution of snp is far from even . cfor <dig>  in which  <dig> snp were detected, was the most polymorphic or gene studied, with an n of  <dig> for the whole population, ranging from  <dig> for pekingese to  <dig> for german shepherd dog . at the other extreme, cfor08c <dig> and cfor <dig> were the least polymorphic genes after the four genes with no snp . cfor08c <dig> has one snp, detected only once, in one pekingese. this would give a theoretical n value of  <dig> for pekingese and  <dig> for the whole population. another example is provided by cfor <dig>  for which we found  <dig> snp. each of these two snp was detected only once, in two different belgian malinois, and one of these two snp was detected in three english springer spaniels and two labrador retrievers . this gives n values of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, for these three breeds .

calculation, at the whole-population level, of n for the  <dig> or genes gave a mean value of  <dig>  comparison at the breed level indicated that the english springer spaniel was the most polymorphic breed, with an n value of  <dig>  whereas the german shepherd dog was the least polymorphic breed, with an n value of  <dig>  .

mean n values were calculated as indicated in the method section for the complete set of  <dig> or genes and for a subset of  <dig> or genes analysed in boxer. mean n values for exons , introns  and for anonymous intergenic sequences were calculated on the  <dig> dogs cohort. nd: not determined.

only  <dig> or genes were analysed in boxer, and we obtained an n value of  <dig>  we therefore wondered whether the large differences in n values between the other six breeds and boxer were due to the  <dig> or genes selected for study in boxer or whether they reflected a truly lower level of polymorphism in boxer. however the n values for these same  <dig> or genes calculated for each of the six breeds were not statistically different  from those calculated for the whole set of  <dig> or genes . this last finding ruled out the possibility of a bias due to the sampling of this subset of or genes and indicated that the level of polymorphism really was lower for boxer or genes – this finding is relevant to the choice of the boxer tasha dna sample  for determination of the dog genome sequence  <cit> .

we compared the level of or gene polymorphism with that of non-coding regions and coding regions devoid of or, by sequencing a series of exons, introns  and intergenic sequences with no known coding function. we obtained n values of  <dig> for exons,  <dig> for introns and  <dig> for anonymous intergenic sequences . these values are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . a comparison of these values indicates that the coding regions of or genes are more polymorphic than most exon sequences and more polymorphic than the non-coding dna .

in a similar study, sutter et al.  <cit>  sequenced five non-coding regions of the dog genome in a cohort of  <dig> dogs of five breeds and detected  <dig> snp and  <dig> indels. these results, indicating a lower level of genetic diversity than that observed in or genes, confirm the high level of genetic diversity of the or coding exons. the isolated or genes and genes belonging to small clusters analysed in this study were overrepresented among the  <dig> or genes as with respect to their presence in the whole repertoire. as these or genes tended to be less polymorphic than the or genes from large clusters, their presence increases the value of n, and the actual difference between or genes and intergenic sequences should thus be even greater.

ka/ks and protein sequence polymorphism
we noted that  <dig> of the  <dig> snp identified within the  <dig> or genes led to pseudoalleles . theoretical translation of intact or genes showed that  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> snp were silent mutations. of the  <dig> missense mutations ,  <dig> would result in the incorporation of an amino acid of a different chemical group .

calculation of the ka/ks ratio, where ka is the number of non-synonymous substitutions  per non-synonymous site and ks is the number of synonymous substitutions  per synonymous site between two closely related species, is the traditional method of assessing the strength of selection affecting proteins during evolution. in a recent study, it was shown that the a/s ratio calculated from the snp content of the human genome is equivalent to the ka/ks ratio for the assessment of selective pressure  <cit> .

using the snp detected in this study, a ka/ks value of  <dig>  was obtained for the  <dig> or genes analysed here . similar values were obtained at the breed level . a ka/ks value of  <dig>  has been reported for a large set  of canine genes  <cit> . comparison of these two values  indicates an absence of strong selective constraint, resulting in greater diversification for the or genes, as already observed for a small subset of human and chimpanzee or genes and for the gene encoding the human bitter taste receptor, than for most other genes  <cit> . as isolated or genes tended to be less polymorphic than or within large clusters, we wondered whether the ka/ks ratio might differ with cluster size. a pearson correlation test on the  <dig> or genes analysed  gave a value of - <dig> , indicating this was not the case. similarly the ka/ks values of the  <dig> or genes within small clusters  and the values for the  <dig> or genes present in the largest cluster  were not significantly different .

we also analysed the distribution of snp within codon positions and found that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> snp were located at the first, second and third codon positions, respectively. this distribution, with 50% of mutations affecting one of the first two positions, at which nearly all mutations induce an amino-acid change, and 50% affecting the third position, at which half of all mutations induce an amino-acid change, is consistent with many mutations  randomly affecting the dna sequence being retained and not counter-selected.

snp were found throughout the or gene sequences, resulting in amino-acid substitutions evenly distributed along the length of corresponding proteins, in the transmembrane, inner and outer parts of the receptors .

however, if we take into account the respective sizes of the various domains, the number of missense mutations is significantly larger in intracellular  than in extracellular  and transmembrane  domains , whereas the number of silent mutations does not appear to differ significantly between domains . these results were obtained for the whole set of data considered together, or when or belonging to small clusters  and or belonging to the large cluster  were considered independently. this indicates the existence of stronger selective pressure to maintain the structural conformation of the parts of the or related to ligand binding  than to maintain the structure of the part of the protein involved in signal transduction and processing. this finding, which conflicts with those of buck and axel  <cit> , should be interpreted taking into account the fact that we compared the sequences of the same gene in different breeds, whereas buck and axel  <cit>  compared paralogous or genes from a single rat and thus compared or with different binding properties. it would thus be of interest to determine whether the amino-acid changes within ic domains affect the efficiency of the transduction pathway and, in turn, odorant sensing properties. the distributions of missense and silent mutations for the  <dig> snp present in only one breed  and for the  <dig> snp shared by all six breeds indicate a significant bias, with missense mutations more frequent among private snp , suggesting selection pressure related to breeding practices.

we used the corp program to determine the effects, if any, of the  <dig> missense mutations  <cit> . of the  <dig> or genes with missense mutation,  <dig> conserved the same Ψl value, whereas changes <  <dig>  were observed for  <dig> or and changes >  <dig>  for  <dig> or. variations of this type were also associated with higher or lower functionality as defined by the corp program. as concerns a putative decrease in functionality, only  <dig> of the  <dig> snp leading to an amino acid changes affect the  <dig> most highly conserved positions  <cit> . in addition, five missense mutations involved the arginine of the maydry conserved motif.

pseudogene formation
mammalian or repertoires contain a large number of pseudogenes – up to 60% for the human repertoire and around 20% for the rodent and dog or repertoires  <cit> . these pseudogenes are not retrogenes and have resulted from nonsense mutations or short indels occurring during evolution. of the  <dig> or genes analysed in this study, seven were strictly pseudogenes,  <dig> were intact in all breeds and  <dig> or genes had both intact and interrupted orf . in each breed, a subset of  <dig> to  <dig> of these  <dig> or have been identified as having one or more pseudoalleles . the frequency of snp closing the frame varies across breeds . for example, cfor08g <dig> has an snp  <dig>  that closes the frame. it is present in all six breeds, but at very different frequencies:  <dig>  in german shepherd dog,  <dig>  in belgian malinois,  <dig>  in english springer spaniel,  <dig>  in greyhound,  <dig>  in labrador retriever and  <dig>  in pekingese. other examples, such as the snp  <dig> of cfor14a <dig> or snp <dig> of cfor12f <dig>  are provided in table  <dig>  more extreme distributions exist, with snp closing the frame in one or more breeds, but not all, such as the snp  <dig> of cfor <dig> or snp  <dig> of cfor <dig>  which close the frame only in pekingese and english springer spaniel, respectively. genotype analysis  indicates that the distribution within breeds is not homogeneous, with dogs having zero, one or two alleles with an interrupted orf. these results indicate that the status of a gene as active or inactive  does not necessarily apply to the whole dog population, depending instead upon breed or even the individual dog. these observations suggest that pseudogene formation is still an active process, as previously reported  <cit> , related to the acceptance of a large proportion of mutational events to the probable continuing diversification of the or repertoire – the risk attached to deleterious mutations being counter-balanced by the highly combinatory nature of the or repertoire  <cit> , partly accounted for by gene redundancy.

paf was calculated independently for each breed and for the whole population. pseudoallele distribution varies considerably between breeds, with some pseudoalleles present in all breeds and some in only one or a few breeds:  <dig> are common to all breeds,  <dig> are found in only one breed and  <dig> are shared by two to five breeds, giving  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> or pseudogenes for gsd, bm, ess, grey, lr and pek, respectively. ns: nonsense, indel: insertion/deletion.

haplotype structures and distribution
we used the fast phase algorithm  <cit>  to identify a total of  <dig> haplotype structures for all or genes with more than two snp . we found that the mean number of haplotypes per gene and per breed varied between  <dig>  for german shepherd dog and  <dig>  for english springer spaniel. not surprisingly, the number of haplotypes per gene increased with the number of snp. however this relationship is not simple and many exceptions were noted. we plotted the haplotype/snp number ratio against the number of snp . we calculated the manhattan distances between the points and generated four groups of or genes by agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with the two extreme groups having  <dig> or and  <dig> or genes. as examples of these two extreme groups, cfor12a <dig> has  <dig> snp and  <dig> haplotypes and doprh <dig> has  <dig> snp and  <dig> haplotypes .

the existence of the two extreme groups  suggests two different evolutionary processes. however, comparisons of gene status  identified no specific feature.

as pointed out above, most of the snp common to all six breeds had different maf. not surprisingly, this leads to very different haplotype patterns in different breeds, with some breed-specific haplotypes, such as the gcagaggtaat haplotype , which was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> pekingese haplotypes but was absent from the other breeds .

in total, we identified  <dig> breed-specific haplotypes . many  were found only once, but some  accounted for 25% or more of the  <dig> possibilities per or gene per breed and might even be the most frequent haplotype in the breed concerned . the combination of a small number of haplotypes may result, for each breed, in a haplotype signature. this signature could be used to certify that a given animal does or does not belong to a specific breed, based on the analyses of limited numbers of or genes. for example, the haplotype structure of cfor <dig> and cfor16h <dig>  deduced from the analysis of  <dig> snp, would be sufficient to identify a dog as a german shepherd dog.

there are  <dig> specific haplotypes, each present once, in gsd and  <dig> specific haplotype present  <dig> times in pek.

linkage disequilibrium 
linkage disequilibrium indicates an association between two polymorphic markers, for which pairs of alleles are inherited together. previous studies have shown that dogs display higher levels of ld than humans. however, ld has also been shown to be heterogeneous, with alternating genomic long and short regions of ld  <cit> . this pattern of alternating long and short ld regions, which differs between breeds, has been attributed to the history of the dog population, which has been characterised by two bottlenecks and expansion periods  <cit> . we investigated the evolution of the or gene repertoire by calculating ld both within and between or genes.

ld within or genes
all pairs of snp  within each or were used to calculate the mean r <dig> per breed – range of  <dig>  for pekingese to  <dig>  for german shepherd dog, with a mean of  <dig>  for the whole population . these values indicate  that the extent of ld for or genes is one tenth the mean extent of ld previously reported  <cit> ;  the lower r <dig> value  obtained for the whole population than for individual breeds is consistent with greater homogeneity within breeds. this low ld value indicates that snp alleles within individual or genes are not inherited as a block and suggests an ongoing gene conversion process potentially generating many or genes with higher levels of polymorphism than the bulk dna  <cit> .

r <dig> values were calculated for pairs of snp  located within coding or exons.

ld within or clusters
a number of the sequenced or genes corresponded to several clusters between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb in size . we first retrieved snp with a maf >  <dig>  and calculated d' values for each pair of snp. the percentage of snp pairs with a d' value >  <dig>  varied from  <dig> to 66% for the five different clusters analysed within the whole population . contrasting results were obtained for analyses within breeds. for example, belgian malinois and greyhound, in cluster  <dig>  were weakly polymorphic and no ld value was calculated, whereas, for german shepherd dog and labrador retriever, 100% of snp pairs had a d' value >  <dig>  and, in pekingese, only 58% of snp pairs had a d' value >  <dig> . these results indicate that the constraints imposed on or cluster evolution are not identically distributed in the different breeds. the ld value calculated per breed was also higher than that calculated for the whole cohort . this result contrasts with the findings of sutter et al.  <cit> , showing that the ld value calculated at the whole-population level for regions devoid of or genes was similar to that obtained for individual breeds. however, our result is consistent with that reported by menashe et al.  <cit>  for the analysis of a human or cluster in different populations.

these values were identified within  <dig> clusters of  <dig> to  <dig> kb . nd: not determined .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown here that overall or gene diversity is very high, with a mean distance  between snp of  <dig> nt, slightly less than that calculated for non-coding sequences and much shorter than the distances calculated for exon sequences. however, this diversity is not uniformly distributed, some or genes having few or no snp, whereas others may have as many as  <dig> snp in their coding sequence. in addition, individual or genes may be highly polymorphic in one or a few breeds and devoid of snp in other breeds. thus, the overall level of polymorphism was found to differ between breeds, with a mean distance of  <dig> for the pekingese and  <dig> for german shepherd dog. an even higher n value was calculated for the boxer, consistent with previous suggestions of a lower level of genetic diversity in this breed  <cit> .

as the presence of different alleles of specific or genes has been shown to affect the perception of isovaleric acid and androstenone in humans  <cit> , this or genetic diversity, with 47% of snp leading to missense mutations, should clearly affect the odorant sensing capabilities of dogs. however, as the ligands of most of these or are unknown, it is not possible yet to correlate the or genetic polymorphism with variation in odorant perception. the level of polymorphism for about 50% of the or genes was found to be higher than that for anonymous sequences, for which all, or almost all mutations arising during dna replication are probably conserved. as there is no evidence to suggest that replication is itself defective, another mechanism, such as gene conversion, should be considered to account for this higher level of polymorphism, as suggested by the low ld values calculated within or genes.

this process, which is of great importance in maintaining sequence homogeneity in genes with multiple copies, such as histone genes, has been proposed as a mechanism guiding the evolution of paralogous or genes  <cit> . we suggest that this mechanism may be involved in the accumulation of snp, although some of these mutations may lead to a less functional or or may be nonsense mutations.

the accumulation of mutations diversifying or amino-acid sequences may have two opposite effects that must be balanced: an increase in odour pattern recognition and the risk of a loss of function. such losses of function do occur, as indicated by the ongoing pseudogenisation observed. however, the risk of losing the ability to sense a particular odorant is minimized by the highly combinatory code  <cit> . nonetheless, not all or genes are polymorphic, and up to 22% of the or genes in an individual breed may be entirely non-polymorphic. this raises the possibility that these non-polymorphic or may be involved in recognising odorants of particular importance or may have a unique binding specificity not shared by other or. finally, we observed that, for each breed studied, it was possible to define specific haplotypes for a number of or genes characteristic of the breed, which could be used as a genetic signature to determine whether or not a particular dog belongs to a particular breed.
