BACKGROUND
during the past years whole exome sequencing  has gained much popularity in research and diagnostics, as focussing on protein-coding regions reduces sequencing costs compared to whole genome sequencing  . concentrating on exonic regions minimises the sequencing target area of the human genome with about  <dig> gbp to less than  <dig> %  <cit> . there is a broad application area of wes such as variant calling  and analysis of copy number variations   <cit>  demonstrating its general usefulness in the genomic field.

in terms of quality validation, many research efforts were focussing on the comparison of different exome enrichment platforms  and their performance to wgs techniques  <cit> . apparently, one recurrent bias appearing with wes is its inhomogeneous coverage across targeted protein-coding regions, which is suggested to be resolved by increasing read depth. however, increasing depth for wes would also place the economic costs for the alternative wgs in similar range to wes  <cit> . for example, in one study the exome coverage of ≥ 20× needed an average of  <dig> × with wes, whereas wgs was sufficient with 44- <dig> ×  <cit> .

in the midst of this debate, we would like to propose a new aspect to the technical side of wes. during standard wes  of our cancer cell lines, we observed a strong irregular distribution of read coverage along exons, which had a size of ≥ <dig> kbp. in the following, the genomic dna fraction sequenced as paired-end reads and flanked by illumina adapters is denominated as insert, in order to confine these to sequencing library fragments including illumina adapters. calculation of the original dna insert size revealed that the genomic dna insert had a peak size of  <dig> bp. this prompted us to consider, whether longer purified dna inserts might improve the evenness of read coverage. in the past, dna insert lengths of 200– <dig> bp for  <dig> ×  <dig> paired-end reads were mentioned to contribute to library optimisation, nonetheless, results were not shown  <cit> . additionally, different fragmentation techniques improved coverage, yet dna insert length were indicated for sonication  but not for enzymatic fragmentation  <cit> . in another study short inserts of 100– <dig> bp are suggested instead of 500– <dig> bp  <cit> , however, at that time the development of exome capture design just started and more importantly, very short single reads of  <dig> bp were analysed. similarly, short reads of  <dig> and  <dig> bp were sequenced for a further publication, in which short insert sizes of  <dig> bp are recommended given the short median length of  <dig> bp of human exons  <cit> . apparently, no specific study on the effect of dna insert sizes to paired-end sequencing has been published to date.

therefore, we tested in this study, whether the genomic dna insert length influences the uniformity of read coverage within targeted regions. beside samples with  <dig> bp peak insert length, a sample group with  <dig> bp peak inserts was produced and validated. the evenness score  <cit>  was applied as metric for assessing the effectiveness of target region coverage. altogether, we would like to provide a short technical note on the effect of dna insert length on the evenness of coverage for paired-end sequenced reads.

RESULTS
production of wes libraries with two different insert sizes
for exploring the effect of different genomic dna insert lengths on the uniformity of coverage in whole exome sequencing , we varied the dna shearing by acoustic fragmentation . two dna inserts groups of six samples each were yielded with approximately  <dig> and  <dig> bp length . exome enrichment was conducted with agilent sureselectxt all exon v5+utr/v <dig> and sequencing produced 18– <dig> million reads per sample . after trimming, removing pcr duplicates and mapping the reads to the human gencode genome v <dig>  manual inspection of alignments to many exons exceeding  <dig> kbp indicated large amplitudes of coverage for  <dig> bp compared to  <dig> bp samples . this observation, that longer inserts might compensate for “mountain-valley” profiles in coverage, encouraged us to examine this in detail.

since the mean dna insert peak for each sample group with  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, was smaller than the resulting paired-end sequenced reads of  <dig> ×  <dig> bp, a high percentage of paired-end reads contained overlapping sequences. as these overlaps did not contain further information for e.g. variant calling and cnv analysis, paired-end reads were joined where overlapping sequences were found and aligned to the human genome. trimming, read mapping and joining statistics are summarised in table  <dig> and phred quality scores for the sequencing cycles are visualised in fig. 1d. nearly all sequenced bases for further analyses had quality scores ≥ <dig> 


in the following sections unmerged and merged sequences are compared along with contrasting  <dig> versus  <dig> bp insert results.

differences in exome capture and read depth
we applied two different exome enrichment kits in this study, namely agilent sureselectxt v5+utr and v <dig> on the  <dig> bp genomic dna insert and  <dig> bp group, respectively . the genomic target region both kits are covering were nearly identical except for the utr stretches which were exclusively contained in v5+utr: v <dig> target regions constitute  <dig> % of v5+utr  and  <dig>  % of v <dig>  were included in v5+utr . hence, for further comparison the specific target region needed to be considered.
fig.  <dig> target regions and relative read coverages. a agilent sureselectxt v5+utr target regions  consisted of  <dig> % overlapping bases to v <dig> and a unique fraction of  <dig> %. the target region of v <dig>  was nearly fully contained in v5+utr. b mean coverage of unmerged and merged paired-end reads considering the size of respective target regions  <dig> and  <dig> mbp for  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. the average coverage was higher in  <dig> bp inserts than in  <dig> bp. this difference declined substantially when merging joint paired-end reads. c recalculation of coverage of unmerged and merged paired-end reads on the respective specific target regions and on common target regions only. the mean coverage on the respective target regions was higher in  <dig> bp insert samples. d portion of respective target regions covered by at least  <dig> ×. despite higher coverage means for  <dig> bp, a smaller fraction of target regions was apparent at ≥10× depth for  <dig> bp samples. for overlapping target regions of v <dig> and v5+utr the fraction of covered regions was still not higher in  <dig> bp reads as would be implicated by the higher coverage means



although aiming to adapt the read numbers to the respective target regions during the sequencing process, the mean coverage to the target region sizes  <dig> and  <dig> mbp was increased for  <dig> bp compared to  <dig> bp inserts . however, this difference attenuated when computing coverage means for merged paired-end sequences. similar results were obtained when calculating the mean coverage of  <dig> and  <dig> bp inserts on their respective target regions and on overlapping target regions of v <dig> and v5+utr . intriguingly, concentrating on the fraction in the respective target region at ≥10× read depth revealed a smaller fraction of  <dig> bp samples covered at that mininum read depth than for  <dig> bp . low coverages in turn mean impaired mutation detection in these regions, whereas at the same time excessive coverage of target regions in  <dig> bp samples  seems dispensible.

comparing uniformity of coverage
as a measure for the skewed distribution of exome captured sequences in the coding regions, the evenness score was calculated allowing for target region and library size correction  <cit>  . hereby, after normalising the coverage of each sample to the integral for each coverage curve to  <dig> , the area below the curve between  <dig> and  <dig> is defined as the evenness score  <cit> . bearing in mind that the higher the evenness score, the more even the coverage, the evenness score for  <dig> bp insert samples was clearly higher than  <dig> bp and hence its coverage more even than the  <dig> bp group  despite the higher average coverage of  <dig> bp . excluding overlapping sequences within the paired-end reads yielded a substantial rise in evenness for both insert groups.
fig.  <dig> evenness between different insert groups and unmerged/merged sequences. before  and after  normalisation of coverage to the fraction of respective target regions for unmerged sequences. the complete integral of normalised coverage to the target region is summing up to  <dig>  c the evenness score computed from the area under the curve of unmerged  and merged sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> normalised coverage. the closer the evenness score is to  <dig>  the better the uniformity of base coverage. the impact of higher insert length was evident; merged inserts gained top evenness scores regardless of relating to the specific corresponding target region or to overlapping target regions



since using different enrichment kits for  <dig> and  <dig> bp samples respectively, the additional utr target region fraction might be the cause of the unevenness observed in  <dig> bp inserts. however, the differences in the evenness scores were comparable to the results above when calculated on the common target region of v <dig> for both  <dig> and  <dig> bp inserts . the augmented evenness score for  <dig> bp inserts in the common coding target regions compared to its v5+utr target region might even hint on inferior read coverage in the utrs or inversely enhanced coverage  and uniformity for the coding regions.

for wes applying paired-end sequencing, libraries with small genomic dna insert length produce overlapping sequences. these overlapping bases within one paired-end read provide no extra information on an alternate dna strand or another allele, since they stem from the identical original genomic dna sequence. the more overlapping bases within a paired-end read, the more bases remain unused, hence the effectivity to gain coverage shrinks with low insert sizes. moreover, joining paired-end reads yielded in higher evenness scores particularly for  <dig> bp inserts , thereby showing another negative impact of redundant overlapping sequences.

on the other side, the median size of human exons is  <dig> bp, thus many bases will map off-target with longer inserts  <cit> , however, the coverage in longer exons would reach higher uniformity and higher minimum depth  instead of distinct “mountain-valley” coverage silhouette. increasing coverage depth unfortunately would not yield in proportionally homogeneous coverage . higher evenness in turn is prerequisite to effectively detect mutations, which is achieved with longer inserts . these longer inserts can be produced by a plain technical adjustment in the dna sample fragmentation step. it may be speculated that peak library sizes of > <dig> bp will result in even better evenness and simultaneously minimise costly overlapping read bases and reduce excess coverages.

missing mutations in shorter insert samples
to demonstrate that shorter dna inserts do increase the false negative rate for mutation analysis, we included four isogenic subclones of the human cell line hg- <dig>  all four hg- <dig> subclones were sequenced at a comparable depth to their respective target regions. of  <dig> mutations found in at least one of the subclones,  <dig> and  <dig> were missed in the  <dig> bp samples but nearly twice as many mutations  in  <dig> bp , although coverage was slightly higher in  <dig> bp inserts for common target coding regions .
fig.  <dig> missed mutations exemplified on four isogenic subclones. a the dna of four isogenic subclones  were fragmented to  <dig> bp for hg3cd5n_cl <dig> and hg3cd5p_cl <dig> and to  <dig> bp peak insert sizes for hg3cd5n_cl <dig> and hg3cd5n_cl <dig>  several mutations were missed by variant calling for samples fragmented to  <dig> bp, but clearly less for  <dig> bp. b example mutation on gene or5h <dig>  with coverage depth of  <dig> × and  <dig> × for  <dig> bp and  <dig> × and  <dig> × depth for  <dig> bp insert samples. or5h <dig> does not contain any utrs in this single  <dig> bp exon. reads were sorted in igv to bases at the mutation site, hence all detected ts for  <dig> bp samples  are indicated. c specific target regions of v5+utr and v <dig> in gene or5h <dig> were identical to which the coverage histogram peaks map. target regions are given in the last two lines. the amplitudes were higher for the  <dig> bp samples as well as the maximum read depth in the visible region compared to  <dig> bp samples. at the same time pronounced amplitudes were also obvious for  <dig> bp within the gene region of or5h <dig> implying that sequencing longer dna fragments would have gained even smaller amplitudes and a higher coverage across the gene region. the four subclones carried four further mutations  beside the failed mutation of  <dig> bp samples  indicating sequence similarity of the subclones



manual inspection of  <dig> selected mutations with a minimum depth ≥20× in both  <dig> bp peak insert samples and simultaneously <10× in  <dig> bp samples and vice versa delivered mutations in four genes, that were discarded by longer insert samples, but mutations in  <dig> genes were missed by shorter inserts . many of the failed mutations by the shorter inserts were found in regions, where amplitudes between maximum and minimum depth were high in the target regions forming a “mountain-valley” pattern as for the mutation in or5h <dig> . although this mutation dropped out in the shorter insert samples due to low depth in a “valley”, the biallelic nature seen in the longer insert was also true for shorter inserts. here, higher coverage depth in target regions for  <dig> bp samples could not improve mutation detection in this gene. expanding the insert length resulted in mapping more reads to off-target regions of or5h <dig>  which was more appropriate for this bait design.

the question arose whether the bait-balancing differences between the two exome enrichment kits may account for the skewed coverage of  <dig> bp compared to  <dig> bp samples. bait-balancing is applied for adjusting the number of probes to the binding efficiency of the targeted regions. for or5h <dig> as an example all coverage histogram peaks reflected the target regions, which were identical to v <dig> and v5+utr . an unoptimised bait-balance between the given oligos within this single exon for both insert groups was apparent and the bait-balance of the v <dig> and v5+utr kit was similar if not identical. it seems, that the manufacturer’s recommended 130– <dig> bp peak insert fragmentation was insufficient to span the entire annotated exon of or5h <dig> on the basis of the target region rather than due to bait-balancing effects of the different capture kits used.

to overcome this technical shortcoming, the baits of the capture assay could be redesigned in closer proximity, or the potential of the current platform could be exploited by applying longer insert sizes. this would be a trade-off between too low as well as excessive read coverages and capturing off-target regions. since flanking sequences to target regions often reside within annotated gene regions, achieving higher uniform coverage should be prioritised.

CONCLUSIONS
although widely used, one major drawback of wes is its skewed coverage distribution within the targeted exome. by simply enlarging genomic dna fragment sizes before exome capturing, the evenness of coverage can be augmented. we think that wes with an average coverage of 80x in contrast to wgs will remain feasible for smaller studies with limited budget in the next years, therefore any optimisation of this technology is assumed to affect a broad community.

hence, increasing the dna insert length maybe even longer than  <dig> bp will gain better uniform read coverage for wes and thus provide an improved basis for variant calling and cnv analyses at minimised sequencing costs.
