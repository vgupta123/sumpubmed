BACKGROUND
oil palm , mainly cultivated in the equatorial tropics of africa, southeast asia and south america, is the world’s most efficient oilseed crop, as it produces about 25% of worldwide vegetable oil annually, 32% of global oils and fats output in  <dig> and 40% of worldwide edible vegetable oil in  <dig>  while accounting for just  <dig> % of global oil crop cultivation land use  <cit> . palm oil is not only widely used in cooking and factories, but is also used for producing biofuels, which resulted in a continuous rise in demand for palm oil in recent years  <cit> . planting higher yielding palms derived from improved germplasm genotypes is the most economically effective approach to guarantee adequate yield results in oil palm production. using the tenera genotype with thin shell , derived from crossing of dura with thick shell  and pisifera with no shell , resulted in a 30% increase in oil yield per hectare, hence improving the crude palm oil  yield in conventional breeding from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tons/ha in the last 50 years  <cit> . recently, the global average cpo yield is  <dig>  tons/ha of oil, still much lower than the estimated theoretical potential at  <dig> tons/ha  <cit> . hence, there is substantial potential to increase cpo yield  <cit> . although considerable genetic improvements have been made in yield in oil palm in the last several decades, the conventional improvement of oil palm is a complicated process, primarily due to long breeding cycles   <cit> . it is also difficult to select for complex traits such as oil content and oil quality. marker-assisted selection  and genomic selection  are expected to accelerate genetic improvement in breeding programs  <cit> .

qtl mapping refers to the identification of the molecular markers associated with quantitative traits on the whole genome  <cit> . it is the essential step towards mas  <cit> . dna markers, evenly covering a genome, are essential for qtl mapping. with the advent of next generation sequencing , single nucleotide polymorphisms  are attractive dna markers to use due to their high abundance, uniform distribution and compatibility with automated genotyping platforms  <cit> . a large number of dna markers are essential for constructing of high-density genetic maps and fine mapping of qtl for important economical traits  <cit> . restriction-site-associated dna sequencing  using ngs is an efficient approach to discover and genotype a large number of snp markers  <cit> . it has resulted in rapid and cost-effective massive marker discovery and has been successfully used to construct high-density linkage maps and fine qtl mapping in several plant species  <cit> . in oil palm, several linkage maps have been constructed with simple sequence repeats  markers and snps . the genomes of elaeis guineensis and another palm species elaeis oleifera have been sequenced  <cit> , supplying the necessary reference genomes to facilitate genotyping by sequencing   <cit> . in previous studies, qtl mapping has been conducted for shell thickness  <cit> , bunch number , fresh fruit bunch yield  and other yield traits  <cit> , oil yield, oil to bunch content , fatty acid composition , plant growth, sex ratio  <cit> , and embryogenesis in oil palm  <cit> . also, a genome-wide association study  identified three key loci for oil to dry mesocarp content  in two palm populations of deli × avros and nigerian × avros in malaysia  <cit> . however, the effects and locations of qtl identified for important traits in different palm populations are mostly different, suggesting that most qtl detected are population-specific. to facilitate mas in oil palm, it is necessary to further identify and verify qtl for important traits in different genetic backgrounds.

oil content traits  are important traits in oil palm production. usually, oil yield is positively correlated with oil content in the fruits of oil palm  <cit> . the aim of this study was to construct a high-density linkage map and map qtl for o/b and o/dm in an oil palm breeding population generated from a cross of deli dura × ghana pisifera. the markers were identified using gbs. using the markers closely linked with the significant qtl for oil content, the elite trees containing the qtl can be detected, which could accelerate improvement of oil yield in oil palm.

RESULTS
variation of oil content traits in a breeding population of dura × pisifera
the two oil content traits  of the palm breeding population used for mapping qtl were evaluated for two and three harvest periods during 2011– <dig>  respectively. the average of the trait o/b was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % whereas the average of the trait o/dm was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . a significant difference between individuals was found in the two traits . the coefficients of variation  across different years or periods were  <dig> – <dig> % for o/b and  <dig> – <dig> % for o/dm . statistical analysis of the phenotypic data showed that the two traits were normally distributed  , which indicates polygenic variation.

genotyping snps and ssrs in a breeding population
five sequencing libraries containing 177 f <dig> trees from the population and two parents were constructed by double-digest rad-seq approaches, and a total of  <dig>  million clean reads were produced by the illumina nextseq  <dig> platform. after sequential quality filtering and sequence trimming,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads were produced for the two parents, and an average of  <dig>  million clean reads were produced in each progeny. using the data sets of the parental samples, a catalogue containing  <dig>  loci was constructed. then, the catalogue was used as reference for snp discovery and genotyping in the mapping population using the program genotypes in stacks software package  <cit> . after filtering out the markers with more than 20% missing data across all data sets,  <dig> snp markers were used for the mapping. from the mapping population,  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals were discarded for further analysis due to high missing data. all the snp information of the remaining  <dig> palms, including map position and sequence, is shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  we also used a set of  <dig> microsatellites  showing polymorphism between the two parental palms for genotyping the palm population. a total of  <dig> informative ssrs were used in the mapping population. the detailed information of ssrs, including map position and primer sequences, is shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  all the snps and ssrs were used to construct a high-density linkage map.

constructing a high-density linkage map and mapping the unassembled scaffolds of the genome in elaeis guineensis
to construct a high-density linkage map and finer map qtl for important commercial traits, we developed and genotyped snp markers using gbs by an improved rad-seq approach  <cit> . the linkage map comprising  <dig> groups correspond to  <dig> lgs of previously published linkage map  <cit>  were constructed for the tenera population, of these lgs, two were each split into two smaller subgroups . the linkage map, shown in fig.  <dig>  contains  <dig> snps and  <dig> microsatellites, spans a total distance of 1527 cm and has an average marker space of  <dig>  cm. the lengths of lgs ranged from  <dig>  cm for lg <dig> to  <dig>  for lg <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  cm. the marker intervals ranged from  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> to  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  in all lgs, except on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  all markers spaces were smaller than 20 cm. a summary of the markers, marker densities and genetic distances for each linkage group, and the relation of linkage groups corresponding to the draft genome  <cit>  and the previous map  <cit> , are shown in table  <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> a high-density linkage map of oil palm  with  <dig> snps and  <dig> ssrs the bar on left side represents the map length in cm, whereas the horizontal bars in each linkage group  are positions of markers mapped

to facilitate the improvement of the assembly of the oil palm genome  <cit> , we tried to map unassembled scaffolds to our genetic linkage map. in our high-density linkage map,  <dig> snps and  <dig> microsatellites were assigned into  <dig> chromosomes. the sequences flanking  <dig> markers were successfully aligned to the reference elaeis guineensis genome. a total of  <dig> unassembled scaffolds  were successfully assigned to the  <dig> corresponding chromosomes. we investigated the genome syntenic relationships between lgs and chromosomes . a high level of genomic synteny was observed between each lg and its corresponding chromosome across the whole genome of elaeis guineensis.  <dig> % of markers with known chromosome location were matched correctly from their linkage groups to the corresponding chromosomes .fig.  <dig> synteny between genetic linkage groups and chromosomes of oil palm . the genetic linkage groups  and the chromosomes  are represented by blocks coloured in green and blue, respectively. the short red lines outside the green lg blocks represent the contigs unassembled by reference genome. for each marker in this study, the corresponding chromosome and its physical position were determined by aligning the flanking marker sequences to the reference genome. the linkage groups were arbitrarily scaled so that the linkage group positions  of the markers could be compared to their physical positions  in the chromosomes




mapping qtl for oil content traits
by qtl mapping, one significant qtl qoil_bunch_ <dig>  for o/b, explaining up to  <dig> % of phenotypic variance both in the first period and for averaged o/b among the three periods, was detected on lg <dig>  furthermore, one suggestive qtl qoil_bunch_ <dig>  for o/b on lg <dig> and two suggestive qtl  for o/dm on lg <dig> and lg <dig> were also identified both in the first period and for averaged value among the multiple periods in this study, explaining  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of phenotypic variance, respectively . the confidence intervals of the four qtl were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  cm , respectively. the markers egsnp <dig> and egsnp <dig> flanked the significant qtl qoil_bunch_ <dig> . the two genotype calls at and tt of egsnp <dig> had average o/b of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, and the three genotypes cc, ct, and tt of egsnp <dig> had average o/b of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, respectively , hence showing significant differences in o/b in the breeding population . the lod value and the nearest snps to the peak of each qtl region are listed in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> whole genome scan of qtl for oil content traits in oil palm . a qtl for averaged oil to bunch content  from  <dig> years, b qtl for averaged oil to dry mesocarp content  from 2 years. the dashed line shows genome-wide significance at p =  <dig>   and chromosome-wide significance at p =  <dig>

the effects of qtl combinations on the increase of oil content
to elucidate the effect of different qtl combinations on the increase of oil content in the palm breeding population, the association with phenotypic data of marker genotypes in four qtl was analysed: qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> , and qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> . the average o/b of individual palms containing one or two o/b qtl with beneficial genotypes were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of palms without those qtl with beneficial genotypes  . however, there was no significant difference between those having one and two o/b qtl with beneficial genotypes. the average o/b of individuals containing three or four qtl with beneficial genotypes for both o/b and o/dm were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. the average o/b of individuals containing any one qtl with beneficial genotype was  <dig> %. the average o/b of individuals containing three or four qtl with beneficial genotype was significantly higher than those individuals containing just one qtl with beneficial genotypes , and the more qtl with beneficial genotype contained in the palm individuals, the higher the average o/b . on the other hand, the differences in average o/b among palm individuals containing two to four qtl with beneficial genotype were not significant.fig.  <dig> effect of the combinations of beneficial marker genotypes at four qtl for oil content on the increase of oil content in a dura × pisifera breeding population of oil palm  a effect of the combinations of qtl with beneficial marker genotypes on the increase of oil to bunch content . b effect of the combinations of qtl with beneficial marker genotypes on the increase of oil to dry mesocarp content . the numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> represent number of the individuals containing the qtl number with beneficial genotypes. 1: individuals with one of qtl qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_bunch_ <dig> , or qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> , respectively. 2: individuals with qtl combinations qoil_bunch_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , and qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> , respectively. 3: individuals with qtl combinations qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , and qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig> , respectively. 4: individuals with qtls combinations qoil_bunch_ <dig>  + qoil_bunch_ <dig>  + qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  + qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> 





as for o/dm, the average phenotypic values were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % among individuals containing beneficial genotypes of qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> , qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> , and both qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  and qoil_mesocarp_ <dig> , respectively. these three groups had no significant difference between one another, but all had almost significant higher average o/dm values than those without any o/dm qtl with beneficial genotype . similarly, there was no significant difference in o/dm among individuals containing two to four qtl with beneficial genotypes for both o/b and o/dm but these individuals all had higher average o/dm  than those containing just one qtl with beneficial genotype  .

discussion
genotyping by sequencing  for the heterozygous oil palm breeding population
with the rapid advancement in next generation sequencing technologies, together with cost decrease, gbs is now feasible for high-throughput snp discovery and genotyping  <cit> . the ddrad-seq with psti-mspi used here for genotyping was an effective gbs method to get a large number of snps in plants  <cit> . we used 48 bar codes and  <dig> index  sets for the illumina nextseq  <dig> platform, which produced paired-end raw reads of 2 × 150 bp in length. the gbs approach has been used firstly in a f <dig> population of asian seabass for genotyping, which produced more than  <dig>  snps across all the samples, and finally  <dig> snps were genotyped in more than 80% of progenies  <cit> . compared to the ~700 mb asian seabass genome, oil palm has a huge genome ~ <dig>  gb  <cit> . we genotyped a f <dig> breeding population of tenera palms derived from crossing of dura and pisifera using the same gbs approach. only  <dig> snps were genotyped in more than 80% of the palm progenies. a similar low number of snps genotyped was reported in another study on gbs in an oil palm f <dig> population derived from crossing dura and pisifera  <cit> . the lower number of snps genotyped in oil palm may be because the tenera individuals, being derived from crossing two different forms, have a high heterozygosity in the genome, resulting in a lower digest efficiency of endonuclease and hence less common snps, than for crosses of the same forms or varieties. in the future, different endonucleases should be tested during the construction of ddrad-seq libraries to improve the efficiency of gbs.

the high-density linkage map and improved genomic assembly for unmapped scaffolds in elaeis guineensis
in our study, we have constructed a high-density linkage map for oil palm, with  <dig> dna markers. the marker density was down to  <dig>  cm in the intraspecific genetic map, from the previous  <dig>  cm  <cit>  and  <dig>  cm  <cit>  for the dura and pisifera intraspecific integrated maps, respectively. in previous studies on linkage mapping in oil palm, linkage maps were constructed with  <dig> to  <dig> genetic markers, including rapd, ssrs, and aflps . however, aflp and rapd markers are mainly dominant markers, and ssrs confer lower throughput and are more laborious to use than snp. in addition, these previous linkage maps of oil palm had a limited marker number due to few numbers of markers available and small oil palm population. the development of 200 k snps arrays and gbs technologies has enabled the genotyping of a large number of snps in larger oil palm populations, and thus the construction of high-density linkage maps  <cit> . in oil palm, a linkage map containing  <dig> snps was constructed using gbs  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, our linkage map is the densest linkage map of oil palm so far. the high-density linkage map will supply an essential tool for fine mapping qtl for mas to accelerate genetic improvement of important traits. however, we noticed that on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  in a few positions, marker spaces were bigger than 20 cm, more markers should be mapped in these positions to reduce marker interval for qtl mapping. and two lgs  contained four small subgroups  in this study, which could be due to the small number of markers called in the two lgs. one way to improve the marker density is to map the scaffolds of the sequenced genome  <cit>  and re-sequenced genomes  <cit>  to the linkage map using in-silico mapping  <cit> . using our high-density genetic map,  <dig> unassembled scaffolds from the sequenced oil palm genome  <cit>  were successfully assigned to the  <dig> corresponding chromosomes , which improved the genome assembly of oil palm. alignment of  <dig> markers mapped in our linkage map to the reference genome revealed a high level of genomic synteny between each lg and its corresponding chromosome across the whole genome of elaeis guineensis. however, we noticed that  <dig> % of aligned segments located on  <dig> chromosomes were not syntenic into corresponding linkage groups. some of these could be caused by recombination in the mapping population, and some could be caused by incorrect genotyping or annotation in reference pisifera genome sequence. further improvement of the linkage maps by genotyping more dna markers in larger mapping populations may improve the assembly of oil palm genome.

qtl mapping for oil content related traits in elaeis guineensis
o/b, o/dm and ffb yield are important components of oil yield in oil crops. simultaneously increasing both traits is difficult to achieve in practical breeding programs because of the complex interdependence between plant developmental traits and yield components. on the other hand, oil content in fruit traits has generally high heritability in oil crops , and is also a complex quantitative trait that is directly related to oil yield in oil palm production  <cit> . we identified four qtl for o/b and o/dm averaged among all the periods in the breeding population. the four qtl were found on lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig> in a tenera population generated by crossing deli dura and ghana pisifera, respectively. due to the variation of environments , the phenotypic data of o/b and o/dm were significantly different in different harvest periods , thus a significant environmental effect on the population can be inferred. the four qtl mapped in the population were for one harvest period and mean o/b and o/md from three and two harvest periods, respectively.

only a few qtl for oil related traits had been identified in these lgs in previous studies  <cit> . there were some differences in location as well as phenotypic effect between our qtl and other previously reported qtl. in these known qtl, the qtl on lg <dig> for oil yield/palm/year, palm oil to pulp ratio  <cit> , and o/dm  <cit> , were different from qoil_bunch_ <dig>  because of different traits and genomic location. the previous qtl for o/dm on lg <dig> was ~ <dig> mbp away from qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  based on the physical position of the former’s linkage marker megcir <dig> on the genome of oil palm  <cit> , and the qtl for o/dm on lg <dig> was ~27 m bp away from qoil_mesocarp_ <dig>  based on the oil palm genome  <cit> . furthermore, we used the three key snps on chromosome  <dig>  associated with o/dm detected by gwas  <cit> , to genotype two parental trees  by sanger sequencing in our mapping population. unfortunately, two snps  were not polymorphic in our mapping population, while the other  were polymorphic, but not informative . therefore, in our population, we were not able to know the effects of these three snps. compared to the previous studies on mapping of qtl for oil yield related traits in oil palm, the differences in the locations and effects of qtl for oil related traits suggest that the four qtl identified in this study could be novel loci and specific to our breeding population. all these data on qtl for oil content traits show that most qtl are population-specific. this population-specificity of qtl could be caused by different germplasms being used in the mapping populations, different planation conditions or different numbers of markers used for the studies. more work should be conducted on the other elite palm germplasms, to fully detect the loci for oil yield related traits for mas in oil palm improvement.

dna markers associated with oil content and qtl combinations for improving oil content
many studies have shown that marker-based strategies of qtl pyramiding are effective and practicable in breeding programs  <cit> . therefore, it is important to search for effective qtl associated with commercial traits. in our study, the genotypes with obvious negative and positive effects at four qtl associated with oil content traits were identified in an oil palm breeding population . varying the combinations of genotypes of markers at these four qtl associated with o/b or o/dm showed that an increased number of qtl with positive effect, resulted in increased o/b , and a slight increase for the o/dm trait in the same breeding population . the obvious dosage effect showed that pyramiding these two o/b qtl and one or two of the o/dm qtl has great potential for oil palm breeding. oil yield relative traits are complex and often controlled by large numbers of genetic loci with small additive effect  <cit> , hence combining multiple qtl with beneficial genotypes in an individual can be an effective strategy of oil yield improvement in palm breeding.

commercial seed production comes from crosses between phenotypically elite dura and pisifera trees, which produce higher yield tenera trees for commercial plantation. mas also can be used to identify the better dura and tenera individuals for the candidate of parents and tissue culturing, containing as many qtl as possible, in the early growth stage of the palms, instead of waiting till they are old enough for their yields to be measured. this reduces the generational interval and accelerates the genetic gain. another way that mas improves the efficiency of oil palm breeding is in the selection of dura and parental pisifera trees. the pisifera, due to being female-sterile, and thus having no oil yield, were normally selected based on progeny tests, such as combining ability or heritability analysis by random choice, which need long, complicated selection cycles in palm breeding. mas could be used to identify elite pisifera trees carrying beneficial qtl, thus reducing the need for progeny tests. in our study, the beneficial genotypes of markers at qtl associated with oil content traits were identified in a breeding population. the latter was derived from a cross between an elite deli dura and an elite ghana pisifera, two parents which were used widely in the breeding program. therefore, there is a great potential to pyramid these qtl in the breeding populations with similar genetic background as our mapping population. however, the effect of the qtl was based on statistical calculations in a particular breeding population, and the genetic background also has a great influence on the effect of qtl  <cit> . hence, we need to verify the effectiveness of these qtl in other breeding populations with different genetic backgrounds from our population.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a high-density linkage map with  <dig> dna markers. this map will provide a basis for fine mapping of qtl and improve the assembly of the genome of elaeis guineensis. four qtl for oil content traits and dna markers associated with these traits were identified in a breeding population. the qtl combinations have the potential to accelerate the improvement of oil content traits in our breeding population by mas. further verification of the detected qtl for oil content traits in other genetic backgrounds and plantation conditions is required to examine whether the qtl detected in this study can be used in mas in other palm populations.
