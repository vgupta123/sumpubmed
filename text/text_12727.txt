BACKGROUND
massively parallel short-read sequencing technologies have become commonly used not only for de novo genome sequencing, but also for a wide range of biological purposes, such as resequencing and large-scale genotyping studies. fragmentation at random nucleotide locations is an essential component of library construction for the various short-read sequencing instruments  <cit> , through delivery of multiple read initiation points in template molecules. sequence information may then be decoded through computational assembly of the short reads. physical shearing is recommended by the manufacturers of all second-generation massively parallel dna sequencing systems, due to the high reproducibility and randomness of fragmentation. however, the process is likely to require the use of dedicated instruments. the nextera technology  and the nebnext dsdna fragmentase kit  are alternative random dna fragmentation methods which require only standard laboratory instruments  <cit> . the nextera technology uses a transposon-transposase combination for random fragmentation of template dna and attachment of transposon ends at the cleaved sites, permitting subsequent pcr amplification and sequencing. with the nebnext dsdna fragmentase kit, double-stranded template dna is fragmented in two sequential steps: nicks are enzymatically introduced into dna, which is then cleaved at the nicked sites. these enzyme-based methods, however, require dna sample preparation  for effective digestion, and the size of products is sensitive to both dna sample quality and reaction duration, all of which require optimisation for each sample in order to achieve the desired outcome.

mspji is a recently characterised modification-dependent endonuclease  <cit> . the enzyme was isolated from mycobacterium sp. jls and recognises sites containing the sequence motif cnnr  when the first base is a 5-methylcytosine  or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and cleaves dna at n12/n <dig> bases distant from the modified cytosine on the 3′-side. enzyme activity is enhanced by short double-stranded dna that includes the mspji recognition site . digestion of genomic dna with the mspji enzyme generates fragments 32-34 bp in length, containing mcpg or mcng sites central to the fragment. methylation status of the human genome has been analysed through sequencing of such fragments  <cit> . due to these unique features as a methylation-dependent restriction enzyme with adjacent non-specific cleavage activity, mspji is expected to be highly useful for dna modification and epigenomic studies  <cit> .

fspei and lpnpi are also recently characterised modification-dependent endonucleases, derived from frankia sp. ean1pec and legionella pneumophila philadelphia  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the sequence recognition sites for fspei and lpnpi are 5’-cc-3’ and 5’-ccdg-3’ , respectively, when the second base is a 5mc or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. similar to mspji, activity of the two enzymes is stimulated by short dna templates containing the recognition site, and the enzymes produce dna fragments with 5’- termini including cohesive ends. these two enzymes hence provide potential alternatives to mspji as a tool for dna fragmentation.

the present study describes a simple and inexpensive method for generation of semi-randomly fragmented dna from amplicon templates. dna amplicons with randomly-incorporated 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine-5’-triphosphate  were synthesised with dna polymerase, and then digested with the mspji restriction enzyme. the size range of the mspji-digested fragments was capable of control through optimisation of 5-methyl-dctp concentration. a purification procedure is unnecessary for dna digestion with mspji, which permits high-throughput sequencing library preparation. short dna fragments were also generated from a range of templates with a whole genome amplification kit based on activity of the Φ <dig> dna polymerase, using the same methodology. illumina sequencing libraries with inserts of  <dig> or 550 bp in length were successfully prepared using the mspji-digested dna, and were processed on the illumina miseq platform.

RESULTS
dna amplification with 5-methyl-dctp and mspji digestion
pcr amplification in the presence of 5-methyl-dctp was performed with locus-specific primers and agrobacterium tumefaciens genomic dna  as template . no significant difference in yield of pcr amplicon due to 5-methyl-dctp concentration levels  was observed, based on the results of agarose gel electrophoresis, which was consistent with the previous studies   <cit> . the pcr amplicons of the agro_gc <dig>  agro_gc <dig> and agro_gc <dig> sequences, of which g/c content ratios were  <dig>   <dig> and 60%, respectively, were digested using the mspji enzyme to identify the consequence of 5mc-containing dna cleavage in the size-resolution range afforded by a  <dig> %  agarose gel . the size range of the digested dna largely depended on concentration of 5-methyl-dctp in the amplification solution, such that a lower range was obtained by a higher 5-methyl-dctp concentration. size range was also related to g/c content ratio, such that smaller dna fragments were identified when amplicons with a higher ratio were digested . this is probably due to the presence of at least one c-g base pair in the mspji recognition site , which will produce a small bias in incidence toward regions of higher g/c content ratio.figure  <dig> mspji-enzymatic digestion of 5mc-containing pcr and Φ <dig> products.  dna fragments amplified with the locus-specific pcr primers for the agro_gc <dig> sequence under the presence of 5-methyl-dctp .  mspji-digested dna fragments derived from pcr products with each locus-specific primers and agro gdna as dna template. molar concentration denotes the 5-methyl-dctp-concentration in pcr solution.  mspji-enzymatic digestion of Φ <dig> enzyme-amplified dna with randomly incorporated 5mc from a range of dna templates.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20 μm denote final concentrations of 5-methyl-dctp in the repli-g wga mixture.



the agro_gc <dig> sequence was also amplified with four types of dna polymerase. the sequence was successfully amplified with all polymerases in the presence of 5-methyl-dctp, and the amplicons were digested with mspji. no significant differences in size range were observed, suggesting that a variety of dna polymerases may be used for the proposed dna fragmentation method . a further characterisation of mspji enzymatic activity indicated that components of the pcr solution do not significantly affect activity of the mspji enzyme when diluted in the reaction mixture; the mspji-mediated digestion of amplicons is completed within 4 hours; and the digestion result is independent of input dna amount, when performed in an appropriate volume of reaction mixture .

whole genome amplification  was performed using the qiagen repli-g mini kit in the presence of 5-methyl-dctp  with genomic dna samples from arabidopsis thaliana  heynh. ecotype columbia , a field pea  poir.) genotype , a perennial ryegrass  genotype , a bovine  genotype , agro gdna, and a dna sample from soil harvested in south australia  as templates. amplified product was visualised on an agarose gel, revealing no significant differences in dna amplification due to variation of 5-methyl-dctp concentration. the amplified dna was digested with mspji . similar size distribution patterns were detected across varying 5-methyl-dctp concentrations: a majority of dna fragments from the 20 μm 5-methyl-dctp-containing solutions was shorter than 250 bp, and a proportion of dna fragments from 10 μm 5-methyl-dctp-containing solutions was close to  <dig>  bp, or larger, in size.

massively parallel sequencing of mspji-digested templates
for exemplification of the effects on distribution of fragments generated with the present method, sequencing libraries were prepared from agro gdna and arab gdna, using the mspji-based and standard physical fragmentation methods . the libraries were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform. totals of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads derived from Φ <dig> enzyme amplification were aligned with the agrobacterium circular and linear chromosomes . from the physically sheared dna, totals of  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads were aligned with the circular and linear chromosomes, respectively. when the short reads from the mspji-digested and physically sheared dna were aligned,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reference agrobacterium genome sequence was covered, respectively. when the sequencing reads derived from arab gdna were aligned with the reference sequence, 3- <dig> million reads were assigned to each chromosome . average depths of coverage from the enzymatically fragmented and physically sheared libraries were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times, respectively, which covered  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reference arabidopsis genome sequence. the results of resequencing activities suggested that mspji successfully generates dna templates with a moderate level of random fragmentation.figure  <dig> illumina miseq short read-sequencing results of the libraries constructed from mspji-digested and physically sheared dna. the sorted alignment was visualised using the tablet viewers.  alignment results of Φ <dig> enzyme-amplified agro gdna-derived reads and physically sheared agro gdna-derived reads to the reference agrobacterium genome sequences for the  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> -2250 kb regions of the circular and linear chromosomes.  alignment results of the arabidopsis genome with the mspji-enzymatic fragmentation and physical shearing methods. read coverage depth for the  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  kb regions of chromosome  <dig> was visualised.

for a further exemplification of the effects on distribution of fragments generated with a methylation-dependent restriction enzyme, the btkit1- <dig> and btkit27- <dig> sequences were amplified from btgdna, using the roche expand long range dntpack kit in the presence of  <dig> ,  <dig> and 60 μm 5-methyl-dctp . amplicons from the  <dig> ,  <dig> and 60 μm 5-methyl-dctp reactions were digested with mspji, fspei or lpnpi . illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from the enzyme-digested dna and sequenced on the miseq platform . totals of 3566- <dig>  reads were aligned with the reference sequences, covering each nucleotide position of the reference. cvs for each data set were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the read alignment result indicated that the read distribution from the lpnpi-digested library was more skewed than those from the other libraries, and there was no large difference in the cvs between the mspji- and fspei-digested libraries. the average frequencies of potential mspji-, fspei- and lpnpi-recognition sites were once in every  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  bp, respectively. this alignment result suggests that although the read distribution pattern depends on the frequency of the recognition sites, an incidence of once in every 8 bp is sufficient to generate reads with relatively even distribution.figure  <dig> short read-sequencing results of the libraries constructed from mspji, fspei and lpnpi-digested dna. read coverage depth was visualised using the tablet viewer.



potential application 1: sequencing of bac clones
although high-throughput dna sequencing technologies have delivered a cost-efficient whole-genome shotgun sequencing method for those species with large genome sizes, information from bac-based genomic libraries is valuable for effective dna sequence assembly  <cit> . sequence information from bac-ends is commonly used for de novo assembly of large genomes  <cit> . the bac-end sequencing procedure, however, requires a large investment, as it depends on the sanger sequencing method  <cit> . a simple sequencing method for bac clones using high-throughput sequencing technologies is described here.

bac dna was amplified in the reaction mixture of the repli-g mini kit, in which 30 μm 5-methyl-dctp were included . the amplicons were digested with mspji. a sequencing library was prepared from the mspji-digested dna and processed on the illumina miseq platform to generate  <dig> - <dig>  reads for each sample. totals of  <dig> - <dig>  reads  were aligned with the reference, which covered over  <dig> % of the reference sequences . the alignment result indicated that 81%-86% of reads were derived from the escherichia coli  genome. when a subset of  <dig>  reads was aligned, around 99% of the reference bac insert sequences were covered an average redundancy of 21- <dig> times. a single run of the illumina miseq platform may generate up to  <dig> million reads, permitting individual sequencing of a whole 384-well plate of bac clones with moderate depth of read coverage. with the illumina miseq platform, a single clone may be analysed at the cost of us$ <dig>  .figure  <dig> bac clone sequencing based on the mspji-based dna fragmentation approach.  amplified bac dna directly from glycerol stocks, using the Φ <dig> enzyme. in the amplification solution, 30 μm 5-methyl-dctp were included.  resequencing results of the bac clones. read coverage depth for each clone was visualised on the tablet software.

potential application 2: whole genome amplification and sequencing of bacterial and fungal genomes
high-throughput dna sequencing technologies also provide an efficient method for pan-genome studies, especially for bacterial and fungal species  <cit> . due to high levels of genomic diversity, a substantial number of bacteria or fungal strains must, however, be sequenced in order to define both core- and pan-genome constituents, and so a high-throughput library preparation method is required. previously, direct wga from fungal tissues was suggested as an efficient dna sample preparation method  <cit> . a combination of the wga and mspji-based dna fragmentation methods may permit high-throughput library processing.

genomic dna from the perennial ryegrass-associated endophyte  was amplified from a section of fungal mycelium . in the multiple displacement amplification  reaction mixture, 15 μm 5-methyl-dctp was included, and the amplified dna was digested with mspji . a sequencing library was prepared from the mspji-digested dna and processed on the illumina miseq platform. totals of  <dig>  million reads were generated, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads were aligned with the reference contig, which represent  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb sections, respectively, of a genome 30 mb in length . a previous study reported that wga was successfully achieved from as few as  <dig> fungal spores, which contribute to significantly reduced durations of dna sample preparation  <cit> . dna fragmentation with mspji does not require several procedures subsequent to wga, and so may enhance efficiency of the wga-based sequencing library preparation .figure  <dig> sequencing of the fungal endophyte genome with the mspji-based dna fragmentation method. two independent experiments  were performed using the single endophyte strain.  wga of the endophyte genome with the Φ <dig> enzyme in the presence of 5-methyl-dctp .  mspji digestion of the endophyte genome-derived amplicons.  flowchart of the mspji- and physical shearing-based library prep procedures from wga products.

potential application 3: sequencing of pcr amplicons
massively parallel sequencing technologies have permitted whole genome re-sequencing in a cost-effective manner  <cit> . subsequently, genome-wide association studies  have identified dna polymorphisms that are correlated with trait-specific variation  <cit> . the numbers of relevant dna polymorphisms identified through gwass have, however, been relatively small  <cit> . identification of trait locus variation-related dna polymorphisms could hence be usefully followed by conversion into specific pcr-based markers, permitting locus-targeted genotyping over larger numbers of individuals  <cit> .

through pcr with 5-methyl-dctp, candidate sequences for genes involved in the perennial ryegrass flowering signaling pathway were amplified from the dna samples of the p150/112 f <dig> genetic mapping population   <cit> . the pcr amplicons were digested with mspji, and sequencing library was prepared for the illumina miseq platform . the sequencing reads were aligned against the references, and snps, which could be utilised for genetic linkage mapping studies, were identified in  <dig> of the sequences . in the lpco and lpft sequence, no variation was identified between the two parental-derived sequence haplotypes. due to the residual presence of heat-resistant dna polymerase and dntps which could perform end-filling and adenine-tailing reactions during heat-inactivation of mspji, the dna fragments from restriction enzyme digestion could be directly used for dna adapter ligation . cost assumption analysis suggested that the mspji digestion method would be less expensive than the previously described cost-reduced physical shearing method   <cit> . due to a lesser requirement for capital expenditure on equipment, the mspji digestion method would become further cost-competitive when sample number is less than  <dig>   <cit> . the operator-specific time for the mspji digestion method was expected to be 40% less than the physical shearing method .figure  <dig> resequencing of pcr amplicons with the mspji-based dna fragmentation method.  pooled pcr amplicons containing 5mc. locus-specific amplification was performed for each sequence independently.  mspji digestion of the pcr amplicons.  flowchart of the mspji- and physical shearing-based library prep procedures from pcr amplicons.



CONCLUSIONS
the present study has reported a novel method for dna fragmentation using the mspji enzyme, which has been exemplified for a range of template types. a dna sample preparation procedure, such as buffer replacement and dna concentration adjustment, is not essential for mspji digestion, which permits a simple dna library preparation procedure from amplicons. a modified method involving combined use with other modification-dependent restriction enzymes may improve the random nature of the fragmentation. the size range of the resulting fragments was capable of control through adjustment of the 5-methyl-dctp concentration in the amplification reaction solution, providing various fragment ranges from <100 bp to >2 kb. the method may hence be applicable for recombinant dna purposes other than second-generation massively parallel short read sequencing technologies. development of a computational methodology may improve sequencing efficiency with this method, through optimisation of 5-methyl-dctp concentration and prediction of coverage for each nucleotide.
