BACKGROUND
bovine babesiosis is a parasitic infection caused by a protozoan of the genus babesia, order piroplasmida, phylum apicomplexa. babesia bovis and babesia bigemina are major species that impose a considerable economic burden on cattle industries because of their wide geographical distribution and pathogenicity  <cit> . the clinical symptoms of b. bovis are more serious than those of b. bigemina, including fever, extensive erythrocyte lysis leading to anemia, icterus, hemoglobinuria, and death. although antiparasitic drugs such as imidocarb successfully control these symptoms  <cit> , they have severe side effects and may promote the emergence of resistant strains and residual chemicals. therefore, safer chemical agents and vaccinations are required.

in general, the genome is an excellent tool for understanding all life forms. unique genes and pathways that are elucidated from genomes are often recognized as targets for chemical or vaccine development. because the genome sequence of b. bovis is publically available  <cit> , it may offer promising information for the development of novel approaches for controlling parasitic infections. according to a previous bioinformatics study, the b. bovis genome encodes  <dig>  nuclear protein-coding genes. however, estimated gene models based on bioinformatics lack accuracy in nonmodel organisms. inconsistencies in gene models have been reported between bioinformatics estimates and experimental observations of apicomplexan parasites  <cit> . therefore, to improve reliability, gene models require verification with experimental evidence.

the acquisition of mrna sequences is one of the most straightforward strategies for verifying gene models. specifically, full-length cdna libraries facilitate the identification of transcription start sites , exon and intron structures, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions , and polyadenylation sites. moreover, massive sets of tsss can be used to identify transcriptionally active regions , which are closely related to promoter regions  <cit> . therefore, the determination of full-length cdna transcriptomes is critical for revisions of gene models, and for elucidation of transcriptional mechanisms.

in this study, we collected 5′ and 3′ expressed sequence tags  from full-length cdnas of b. bovis that were synthesized using the oligo-capping method  <cit> . in brief, cap structures at 5′ ends of mrna were replaced with synthetic linker rna sequences using the oligo-capping method. subsequently, chimeric rna was used to synthesize cdna with fixed 5′ transcript sequences. this cdna was then sequenced, and the data was entered into an updated gene model to identify novel genes. in addition, consensus sequences around tsss and putative dna cis-elements for transcriptional control were identified by comparison with promoter regions identified in genome-wide analyses.

RESULTS
construction and analysis of full-length cdna
a total of  <dig>  clones were randomly selected for plasmid extraction . subsequent one-pass sequencing from 5′ and 3′ ends using the sanger method produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences, respectively . after assembly of paired 5′ and 3′ ests using cap <dig>   <dig>  sequences were successfully united into one sequence, and one-pass sequences with poor quality and genes with long transcripts were excluded by miss assembly. finally,  <dig>  sequences passed the filter for coding capacity and were selected. these were annotated and redundancy was eliminated, resulting in  <dig>  full-length cdna sequences , including  <dig>  cdnas that corresponded with preproposed gene models in piroplasmadb, and  <dig> newly annotated genes . among the  <dig> newly annotated genes,  <dig> showed sufficient homology to genes of other apicomplexan parasites . in addition, features of these  <dig> cdna sequences were sufficiently similar to those of the other gene sets , indicating that they may be newly identified protein coding transcripts. among these, numbers of the genes with multiple exons and average exon numbers per gene were higher than those in other gene models , indicating that genes with multiple exons are relatively difficult to predict from genome sequences and result in miss annotation. in contrast,  <dig> cdna sequences with little homology showed unique features. specifically, the median coding sequence  length was shorter, as indicated by the smaller numbers of genes with multiple exons and longer median exon lengths than those in other gene sets . these observations suggest that certain parts of the transcripts identified in this est analysis are noncoding rna, or were derived from genomic dna as artifacts. nonetheless, promising protein coding cdna sequences with large cds lengths and multiple exons such as xbbk <dig> contig, xbbk <dig> contig, and xbbk <dig> contig remained in this gene set. these b. bovis-specific novel genes may have b. bovis-specific functions in proliferation and host–parasite interactions. in general, gene finding algorithms such as glimmerhmm  <cit>  require training data sets for better prediction. although training data sets for model organisms have been constructed using experimental data, available babesia spp. training data sets are limited, potentially reflecting the observed discrepancies between experimentally observed cdnas and preproposed gene models. because a degree of consistency was observed between the  <dig>  full-length cdna sequences and preproposed annotations, we performed genome and amino acid alignments of these sequences . in these analyses,  <dig> sequences were identical to preproposed genes, whereas  <dig> were almost identical but with amino acid substitutions that probably originated from sequencing errors or polymorphisms among strains. the remaining  <dig>  sequences had partial homology to existing annotations, although they had structural inconsistencies that may reflect the alternative usage of start codons and/or splicing.table  <dig>

the 5′ utrs that lie between tsss and first in-frame initiation codons are known to play crucial roles in post-transcriptional regulation by modulating translational efficiency and mrna stability through the actions of ires and riboswitches  <cit> . this mechanism is observed in a wide variety of organisms, including humans, plants, and yeast , suggesting that apicomplexan parasites have similar functions. however, these functions have been poorly investigated. therefore, to elucidate the functions of the 5′ utrs of b. bovis, we constructed a genome-wide 5′ utr sequence data set using full-length cdna sequences and demonstrated that the median length of the 5′ utrs of b. bovis is  <dig> nts. the average 5′ utrs are  <dig>  nts in humans,  <dig>  nts in rodents,  <dig>  nts in invertebrates,  <dig>  nts in viridiplantae, and  <dig>  nts in fungi  <cit>  and the mode length is approximately  <dig> nts in toxoplasma gondii
 <cit> . these lengths agree with our observations in b. bovis. similarly, the median length of the 3′ utrs of b. bovis is  <dig> nts .

gene expression frequencies are also indicated in est data. therefore, we examined the  <dig>  5′ ests data set and selected  <dig>  sequences following successful mapping onto the b. bovis genome. to estimate expression frequencies, these were then mapped onto preproposed cdss with novel sequences identified in this study . the resulting ranking was not identical to that in a previous study of ests  <cit> , although it showed similar tendencies. these discrepancies may reflect differences in culture conditions and parasite strains or sampling errors associated with small data sets. logarithmic plots of expression levels and ranks of each gene resembled the power law  and indicated similar transcriptome distributions to those observed in previous studies  <cit> .

b. bovispromoter components and typical structure
transcription is controlled by the coordinated binding of promoter sequences by transactivators. in humans and model organisms, promoter structures have been intensively examined in a genome-wide manner  and have been shown to play pivotal roles in gene and phenotype expression. however, the promoter structure of babesia spp. remains unknown. therefore, we characterized the promoter structure of b. bovis using high resolution tss information derived from a full-length cdna data set.

genome-wide tss distributions were examined by mapping 5′ ends of 5′ ests. in briefly,  <dig>  reliable 5′ end sequences of  <dig> nts were selected from  <dig>  5′ ests. of these,  <dig>  were successfully mapped onto the b. bovis genome sequence,  <dig>  locations were assigned as tsss after considering redundantly mapped sequences, and  <dig>  tars were identified.

we selected motifs in the - <dig> to + <dig> regions of tsss from the tar data set and examined these using meme  <cit> . the estimated consensus sequence tyaywww was found in  <dig> of the  <dig>  tars, with p values of < <dig>  . we also examined the positional distribution of this motif around tsss. examinations of sequences around tsss  showed that the motif was distributed only on tsss . moreover, adenine residues at tsss and cytosine residues at the - <dig> position were clearly conserved and + <dig> to + <dig> positions tended to be thymidine, as shown in t. gondii
 <cit> . this ca motif was also conserved in initiator consensus sequences from vertebrates  <cit>  and dicotyledonous plants  <cit> , despite differences in the methods for identifying consensus and diversity of subject species. data sets for b. bovis and t. gondii were collected from single organisms, whereas the data sets from vertebrates and plants were collected from multiple organisms. according to molecular recognition analyses, the initiators taf <dig> and taf <dig> play pivotal roles . in plasmodium falciparum, pfl1645w and mal7p <dig>  are promising functional homologues of taf <dig> and taf <dig>  respectively, as predicted using bioinformatics methods  <cit> . moreover, their corresponding genes bbov_iv <dig> and bbov_ii <dig> were annotated in the b. bovis genome, implying that initiator recognition and tsss have evolved with closely related molecular mechanisms across taxonomic kingdoms.table  <dig>

in subsequent analyses, we identified a cis-element that is involved in transcriptional control. to generate a putative promoter set, - <dig> to + <dig> regions from typical tsss of the  <dig>  tars were selected and examined using cisfinder  <cit> , and -100– <dig> regions were examined using meme  <cit> . these analyses showed frequent distribution of atgggg and acaca within promoter regions.

to validate the atgggg motif, we examined positional distributions of these candidates around tsss and found a clear peak at  <dig> nts upstream . further investigations of the reciprocal sequence ccccat showed equivalent distribution to that of atgggg , implying that the motif may be functional regardless of its direction. the ccccat motif has been identified in theileria parva and theileria annulata using encyclopedic promoter analyses. although the reciprocal motif atgggg was not examined in these species, its peak was found at - <dig> nts from tsss, differing slightly from our observations  <cit> . in further investigations, we examined functional enrichments of genes carrying these promoter motifs, and identified genes corresponding to the  <dig>  tars by calculating relative distances. subsequently,  <dig>  tars were found with candidate initiation codons. among these,  <dig> tars had the atgggg or ccccat motifs in the - <dig> to - <dig> region from tsss. subsequent enrichment analyses using gene ontology terms from gostat  <cit>  indicated significant enrichment in “structural constituent of ribosome”  and “translation”  categories, with e-values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively. enrichments of protein synthesis have also been reported for the ccccat motif in t. parva and t. annulata
 <cit> , suggesting that the motif may be conserved in piroplasms as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in protein synthesis.figure  <dig>

to validate the acaca motif, we examined the positional distribution of these candidates and found periodical distribution around tsss . the reciprocal sequence tgtgt was also periodically distributed, but its phase was shifted . based on these observations, we examined all 5-mer repeat motifs comprising two nucleotides and found periodical distribution of tatat as an additional motif , with similar cycles but differing phases . the related motifs cacac, gtgtg, and atata also showed similar distributions . the only other combinations that showed distinguishing distributions were ggggg, ccccc, gcgcg, and cgcgc, with peaks around - <dig> nts . ggggg and ccccc motifs are closely related to atgggg and ccccat motifs, respectively. however, gcgcg and cgcgc motifs may be functional and gene ontology enrichment analyses showed frequent but insignificant presence of these in upstream promoter regions of ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis  genes . to confirm the specificity of these motifs for apicomplexan parasites, we examined periodical distributions in the tss database dbtss, which contains precise positions of tsss in the genomes of various organisms  <cit> . promoter regions from - <dig> to + <dig> of human and mouse tsss were obtained and the distribution of acaca, tgtgt, and tatat motifs were examined as in b. bovis. however, no periodical distributions were found in human  or mouse  databases, and no related periodical distributions of other combinations were observed as in b. bovis . in contrast, the acaca motif was reportedly observed in t. parva and p. falciparum
 <cit> , although periodical distributions have not been reported. rather than reflecting the differences in species, these discrepancies may have been caused by differences in the precision of tss identification. nonetheless, these observations imply that the motif is common among some apicomplexan parasites, and the present periodical patterns had interval lengths of 140– <dig> nts. minimum units of nucleosome repeat lengths comprise 147-bp dna sequences around core histone octamers and 20-bp dna linkers and are much longer than our observations. however, previous studies demonstrate that the minimum observed nucleosome repeat length is much closer to our observation of approximately 155 bp in schizosaccharomyces pombe and aspergillus nidulans
, and p. falciparum
 <cit> . on the other hand, these discrepancies may reflect the involvement of unconventional nucleosome structures. the conventional histone octomer comprises two h2a, h2b dimers and h <dig>  h <dig> tetramers. in contrast, unconventional histones comprising variants such as h2b.z, h2a.z, and cenp-a have specific functions that are distinguishable from the conventional one. crystal structure analysis of human centromeric nucleosomes containing cenp-a suggests that only 121-bp dna fragments tightly bind to nucleosomes, unlike conventional h <dig> nucleosomes  <cit> . in p. falciparum, it was demonstrated that the nucleosome with h2a.z specifically localizes to intergenic regions  <cit> . moreover, no homologue to the linker histone h <dig> has been identified in apicomplexan parasites  <cit> . faire-seq and maine-seq analyses in p. falciparum demonstrated that nucleosome binding to tsss is associated with gene expression  <cit>  and there are preferred dna motifs for nucleosome assembly  <cit> . these collateral data warrant the assumption that the observed periodical patterns in this study are involved in chromatin structure and regulate gene expression via chromatin remodeling processes.

in further analyses, we applied this scanning method to known apicomplexan and mammalian core promoter motifs. a previous study showed the distribution of gattcc in t. parva and t. annulata at regions that are - <dig> nts from tss  <cit> . moreover, gcatgc was identified as a pf14_0633-binding target in p. falciparum
 <cit> , an ap2-sp-binding target in plasmodium berghei
 <cit> , and a toxoplasma ribosomal protein -2-binding target in t. gondii
 <cit> . gtgcac is known as a subtelomeric variant gene promoter element - <dig>  <cit>  and a binding target of pff0200c_dld and pfsip <dig>  <cit> . tagcta is also reportedly a binding target of pb.ap2-o  <cit> . therefore, although the gtgcac motif was moderately concentrated in the -50-nt area, the other motifs did not show distinguishing distributions in comparison with the atgggg/ccccat motif . in particular, gattcc was not specifically distributed around tsss, as observed in t. parva and t. annulata, indicating that the motif is specific to theileria spp. and may be involved in specific biological phenotypes, such as infectivity in lymphocytes. according to mammalian motifs, we examined tata boxes, upstream tfiib-recognition elements , downstream bre , and downstream promoter elements , containing the consensus sequences tatawaar, ssrcgcc, rtdkkkk, and rgwyvt, respectively  <cit> . in these analyses, tata boxes showed periodical-like patterns . in contrast, tata boxes are known to be distributed around - <dig> nts from tsss , and tata box consensus sequences are closely related to tatat and atata motifs. these are also periodically distributed, suggesting that the observed pattern for tata boxes was residual and no functional motifs correspond with the tata box in b. bovis. this observation also indicates that other mammalian motifs are nonfunctional .

collectively, we speculate model promoter structures and transcriptional mechanisms in b. bovis that explain our observations . primarily, we identified the tss initiator-like motif tyaywww. in other taxonomic kingdoms, this initiator works as a binding site for the general transcription factors taf <dig> and taf <dig>  <cit> , and previous in silico analyses demonstrate that apicomplexan parasites express homologs of taf <dig> and taf <dig>  <cit> . therefore, b. bovis may also use this molecular mechanism at the final step of transcriptional initiation, as described previously in p. falciparum
 <cit> . similar to t. gondii and majority of other organisms, the average length of 5′ utrs was  <dig> nts, suggesting similar involvement in the regulation of gene expression, similar to that in other organisms. periodical distributions of acaca, tgtgt, and tatat were observed around tsss. however, this profile was not observed in human and mouse , and previous studies indicate that transcriptional mechanisms differ between apicomplexan parasites and other eukaryotes to a certain degree  <cit> . in particular, we assumed that the periodical distributions are involved in tight assembly of nucleosome structures and control transcription, although discrepancies of nucleosome repeat lengths remains to be clarified by additional experimental evidences. on the other hand, we observed clear peak distributions of atgggg and ccccat at -50-bp regions from tsss. although it remains unclear how this motif functions regardless of orientation, chromatin remodeling factors may be recruited to loosen nucleosome structures. therefore, the scheme shown in figure  <dig> proposes transcriptional arrest by histones and subsequent activation by putative chromatin remodeling factors that interact with atgggg or ccccat elements.figure  <dig>

previous investigations of plasmodium and toxoplasma demonstrate promoter structures , putative dna cis-elements , and the involvement of chromatin structures in transcription  <cit> . the present analyses of babesia parasites were almost consistent with these studies and warrant the expansion of the concepts related to babesia species. nonetheless, the use of fine tss mapping is a critical distinction between the present and previous studies and allowed more specific and sensitive assessment of the distribution of examined motifs, particularly for acaca, tgtgt, and tatat motifs that lack definition in previous studies  <cit> . therefore, the present analyses indicate that the distance from tsss may be a critical factor for functionality of dna cis-elements in apicomplexsan parasites.

CONCLUSIONS
the full-length cdnas dataset enable us to revise previous gene model derived from the genome. in parallel, location-specific consensus motifs in promoter sequences were discovered by virtue of tsss identification with one-base resolution of the method. these observations 1) indicate the utility of integrated bioinformatics and experimental data for improving genome annotations and 2) allowed the illustration of a model promoter composition, which supports the differences in transcriptional regulation frameworks between apicomplexan parasites and mammals.
