BACKGROUND
the development of early diagnostic biomarkers and innovative therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression of cancers is urgent. however, common biomarker development strategies, based on gene expression alone, have only limited potential to identify novel biomarkers. due several distinguishing characteristics, micrornas  have become new potential biomarkers in cancer genetics. mirnas are small noncoding rna molecules which "micro-manage" messenger rna  expression by reducing its translation and stability  <cit> . recent studies show that in particular, mirnas play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , angiogenesis  <cit> , metastasis  <cit> , and chemoresistance  <cit>  by changing the expression of both oncogenes and tumor suppressors  <cit>  in pancreatic cancer. these biological roles of mirnas represent their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.

an important step of estimating the gene-regulatory activity of mirnas is accurately predicting their targets and monitoring their expression levels. several computational target prediction tools have been developed, such as targetscan version  <dig>   <cit> , pita version hg <dig>  <cit> , and mirvestigator  <cit> . however, these in silico target prediction tools suffer from high false positive rates because the tools use only sequence complementarity and assume structural stability  to predict a specific mirna's target  <cit> . as mirna regulatory activation often depends on the distinct tissue being studied , the use of condition -specific mirna and mrna expression data is required to find true mirna activity  <cit> . therefore, the use of mirnas as potential biomarkers in dismal cancers such as pancreatic cancer remains difficult.

pancreatic cancer is one of the most hard-to-diagnose and aggressive malignancies, despite increasing knowledge of its etiology  <cit> . because of its highly lethal nature and silent symptoms, pancreatic cancer has remained one of the leading causes of cancer-related death  <cit> . among the several types of pancreatic cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  is the most abundant cancer type which accounts for about 85% of exocrine pancreatic cancers. although recent advances in gene expression profiling technology, such as microarray and massively parallel sequencing, enable researchers to discover gene-based biomarkers for pdac diagnosis, there are no highly effective diagnostic markers for pdac. in order to improve the survival rate of pdac patients, it is important to identify efficient diagnostic, prognostic, and therapy response markers.

in this study, we performed a novel approach to identify diagnostic markers for pdac by integrating mirna and mrna expression profiles. using paired mirna and mrna expression profiling, we successfully identified promising mrna and mirna markers. by determining differential mirna expression profiles and interaction with their target genes in pdac, as compared to normal pancreatic tissues, we estimated mirna expression levels in independent datasets lacking mirna expression , and validated the diagnostic performance of mirna marker candidates.

RESULTS
in this section, we firstly identified multi-markers using mrna and mirna expression data from  <dig> pdac tissues and  <dig> benign pancreatic tissues, using support vector machine  classification and leave-one-out cross-validation . then, using mirna target interactions constructed using publically available target prediction tools, we validated marker candidates in independent datasets to select more reliable markers. in the case of independent datasets lacking mirna expression, we used estimated mirna activity for validation . after validation of the selected candidates, we used other cancer datasets to evaluate and annotate their functions, as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

identification of multi-marker candidates from pdac expression data
for identification of multi-marker candidates for pdac, we used mirna and mrna expression data from  <dig> total pancreatic tissues of  <dig> pdac tumors and  <dig> benign tissues  <cit> . to prevent overfitting of imbalanced data, loocv and svm with sample class weights were applied, as described in the methods section. after evaluation analysis using pdac and independent datasets, we identified  <dig> multi-markers for  <dig> mirnas, and  <dig> genes for pdac diagnosis.

table
 <dig> shows the  <dig> identified multi-markers with high accuracy  for diagnosis of pdac in our training datasets and independent datasets. specifically, mir- <dig> was upregulated in pdac, and mir- <dig> was recently found to be silenced by promoter dna methylation in pancreatic cancer  <cit> . however, dna demethylation events could induce mir- <dig> expression showing that epigenetic mechanisms regulating mirna levels may be involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis. likewise, mir-135b was reported as a biomarker for pdac  <cit> , ovarian cancer, and colon cancer  <cit> , in which it promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis  <cit> , and mir-135b was similarly upregulated in our findings. by contrast, downregulation of mir-148a was reported in pancreatic, bladder, and lung cancers, and mir-148a was preventative of tumor angiogenesis and cancer progression  <cit> . mir- <dig> is also a well-known potential biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer. as most mir- <dig> targets are tumor suppressors, mir- <dig> is associated with various cancers such as those of the breast, ovary, cervix, colon, lung, liver, brain, esophagus, prostate, pancreas, and thyroid  <cit> . mir- <dig> has also been reported as differentially expressed in most pancreatic cancers, in which it promotes poor survival rates  <cit> .

 <dig>   <dig> mirnas were identified for efficacy in the diagnosis of pdac. of these,  <dig> were previously known to be differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer  <cit> . however, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-487a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> have never been reported in pancreatic cancer.

out of  <dig> target genes,  <dig> were coregulated by more than one mirna. table
 <dig> lists  <dig> target genes that were coregulated by more than  <dig> mirnas. although there are complex interactions between these target genes and mirnas, their expression direction was required to be negatively correlated  for pdac vs. normal conditions in mirna-target gene network . the function of most co-regulated target genes correlated with cancer metabolism and cancer progression, through such processes as attenuated apoptosis, abnormal development, angiogenesis, and transcriptional dysregulation.

estimating the relationship between mirna activity and mirna targets
in our previous study  <cit> , we used the average balanced accuracy , i.e., the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity of target-genes, as a metric for mirna activity performance. in this paper, we modified the estimation algorithm to improve accuracy of mirna activity . the main difference was that reliable mirna-target gene relationships were determined by testing pancreatic cancer datasets for estimating mirna activity.

using gse <dig> dataset  <cit>  with both mrna expression and mirna expression, we evaluated our current and previous mirna estimation algorithm by comparing the estimated and observed bas of specific mirnas. the mean-squared errors were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for our new and previous mirna estimation algorithms, respectively.

diagnostic performance of selected markers in other cancers
using our selected pdac multi-markers, we evaluated their diagnostic performance in lymphoma and breast, hepatocellular, and lung cancers. all independent datasets were collected from the geo. figure  <dig> presents our selected multi-markers for the four other cancers. most mirna markers showed weak association with other cancers .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we developed a novel single and multi-marker identification approach for pdac diagnosis by analyzing integrated mrna and mirna gene expression profiles. to overcome overfitting of imbalanced data, we applied a svm model with sample class weights and cross-validation, based on sample partitioning in our dataset and independent datasets. finally, we identified  <dig> multi-markers for  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> genes as promising potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.

methods and materials
expression profile datasets
to identify multi-markers in pancreatic cancer, we used mrna and mirna expression data from  <dig> pdac patients and  <dig> normal pancreatic patients, following surgery for kidney stones and non-malignant pancreatic disease at seoul national university hospital  . all human subjects studies were approved by the institutional review board of seoul national university hospital. in this dataset, mrna and mirna expression levels were profiled on affymetrix  hugene  <dig>  st  arrays and affymetrix genechip mirna  <dig>   arrays, respectively. we used  <dig>  human mirna probes, out of  <dig>  probes, on the affymetrix genechip mirna  <dig>  array.

for validation with independent datasets of selected multi-marker candidates, we collected expression datasets for pdac , lymphoma , breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , and lung carcinoma  from the gene expression omnibus   <cit> . all collected expressed data were performed using quantile normalization and rma normalization by r package.

mirna and mrna biomarker identification for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer
we developed a novel approach to identify candidate mrna and mirna multi-markers for pdac. the schematic workflow of our pipeline is depicted in figure  <dig>  paired mirna and mrna expression, and mirna-mrna networks were integrated to predict performance for diagnosis of pdac. this approach is composed of five steps. first, the relationships between mirna and its target genes were constructed by mirna target prediction tools. second, mrna and mirna biomarker candidates were detected using our pdac expression data. in the third step, mrna and mirna biomarker candidates were validated by independent datasets. fourth, diagnostic performances of the validated marker candidates were checked in other cancers. finally, in the last step, the biological functions of the validated marker candidates were annotated.

step 1: prediction of mirna-target gene interaction
although many mirna studies have been performed, only a few mirna targets have been well validated. to collect reliable mirna-target relationships covering almost all mirnas, we employed several in silico prediction algorithms. first, we used all validated target information for  <dig> mirnas from mirtarbase  <dig>   <cit> , and predicted target information for  <dig>  mirnas from three mirna target prediction methods such as targetscan version  <dig>   <cit> , pita version hg <dig>  <cit> , and mirvestigator  <cit> . these three prediction methods were evaluated as reliable methods in  <cit> . in this paper, we used  <dig> , <dig> mirna-target relationship data for  <dig>  mirnas and  <dig>  targeted genes. for detecting more reliable mirna-target relationships for specific conditions such as pdac, only negatively correlated expressed target genes  were chosen . finally,  <dig>  mirna-target relationship data points, for  <dig>  mirnas and  <dig>  targeted genes, were used in this study.

step 2: identification of multi-marker candidates with pdac data
to identify multi-marker candidates, we focused on classification performance with pdac tissues and benign tissues. in this step, support vector machine  was applied for qualitative classification evaluated with leave-one-out cross validation . in consideration of our imbalanced sample size , svm was employed with sample class weights   <cit> . ba, area under the curve , and p-values from the permutation tests were used for assessing the performance of each prediction model. using loocv, we calculated ba and auc values from the prediction accuracies of each marker in the testing dataset. ba is defined as an average of sensitivity and specificity, and is a more appropriate evaluation measure for imbalanced datasets than conventional accuracy . the permutation p-values were calculated from empirical null distribution of bas by  <dig> ×  <dig> sample permutations for markers with high bas.

using the mirna and mrna target relationships generated in step  <dig>   <dig> multi-markers for  <dig> genes and  <dig> mirnas were selected with bas >  <dig> , auc >  <dig> , and bonferroni adjusted p-values <  <dig>  for genes and mirnas, respectively.

step 3: evaluation of prediction performance in independent pdac datasets
to avoid selection of markers with specific data-dependency or specific platform-dependency, all identified single or multi-markers were evaluated using three public, independent pdac datasets collected from the geo  <cit>  . of the three, pdac dataset <dig> had both mrna and mirna expression microarray profiles from gse <dig>  <cit> , while pdac dataset <dig> and dataset <dig> had only mrna expression profiles using microarray data from gse <dig>  <cit>  and gse <dig>  <cit> . to select reliable and robust mirna-target gene multi-markers, mirnas and their putative target genes having negatively correlated expression, and bas >  <dig>  in pdac dataset <dig>  were selected.

to validate mirna prediction performance in the profile datasets  containing only mrna expression, we estimated the expression of specific mirnas using their predicted mirna-target gene relationships. in figure  <dig>  linear regression models were fitted with mirna and mrna expression data from the  <dig> cancer tissues and  <dig> benign tissues. then, the expression of the mirnas of interest was estimated by regression models and its targeted-gene expression data in the independent datasets. using this estimated mirna expression, its prediction performance could then be calculated. we extracted the multi-markers with bas >  <dig>  in one or more of the pdac datasets  <dig> and/or  <dig>  finally, after validation with the three independent pdac datasets, we selected  <dig> mirna-target gene multi-markers for  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> genes.

step 4: evaluation of prediction performance in other cancer datasets
to examine the feasibility of repurposing our identified marker candidates for other cancers, we collected other cancer datasets having mrna expression data for lymphoma  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> , and lung carcinoma  <cit>  from geo datasets. based on svm-loocv evaluation analysis, the selected single and multi-markers were evaluated.

step 5: gene ontology analysis and mirna-mrna network generation using the identified biomarkers
the targeted genes of the identified multi-markers were annotated for gene ontology pathways/processes  using panther  <cit> . in this analysis, markers with annotation results with bonferroni-corrected p-values <  <dig>  were selected. using this go annotation, mirna-target gene relationships of identified multi-markers were represented by the network generated by cytoscape  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  .
