BACKGROUND
amidated peptides act as hormones, neuromodulators and autocrine growth factors  <cit> . each amidated peptide is synthesized from a peptidylglycine precursor through the actions of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase . in mice engineered to lack the pam gene, peptide amidating activity is not detectable and embryos die at mid-gestation  <cit> . pam contains two catalytic domains, peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase  and peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase . the enzymes act sequentially, first converting the peptidylglycine substrate into a short-lived peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine intermediate and then cleaving the c-n bond to produce the amidated peptide and glyoxylate  <cit> .

the active site of phm contains two copper residues, each of which is essential for activity. copper is not tightly bound to phm and no other metal can substitute for it. atp7a, a p-type atpase, transports the copper it receives from cytosolic copper-binding chaperones into the lumen of the secretory pathway, where the copper is available to phm  <cit> . mutations in human atp7a cause menkes disease, a lethal disorder characterized by copper deficiency  <cit> . mice bearing a mutation in the atp7a gene display similar symptoms and survive for less than two weeks after birth. among the many deficits observed in these mice is the inability to produce normal levels of amidated peptides  <cit> . chelation of copper in vitro or in vivo also leads to a reduced ability to produce amidated peptides  <cit> .

the reaction catalyzed by phm is still not fully understood, but requires two single electron transfer steps. ascorbic acid  is present at high levels in the secretory pathway and is generally the source of the reducing equivalents needed to support peptide amidation  <cit> . in the absence of ascorbic acid in cell culture systems, peptide amidation fails to occur and other single electron donors or reducing agents , cannot fully substitute for ascorbate  <cit> .

previous studies of the production of amidated peptides in cell lines have had mixed results. using transfected cho and cos <dig> cells, takahashi et al.  <cit>  found very efficient amidation of salmon calcitonin , while hayashi et al.  <cit>  reported that amidation of gastrin  was efficient in cho cells but not in cos <dig> cells. these results are puzzling, since peptides terminating with –phe-gly are far better substrates for pam that peptides terminating with –pro-gly, using test tube assays and purified enzyme  <cit> . johansen et al.  <cit>  showed that amidation of npy , another excellent pam substrate, only proceeded to 50–80 % completion in different cho cell lines. work using neuroendocrine lines which express prohormone convertases along with pam consistently always shows complete amidation after transfection of preprohormone precursor cdnas . thus, it is difficult to predict which peptide precursors will be efficiently amidated in which cell lines, especially if the goal is to achieve essentially 100 % amidation without extraneous or unwanted endoproteolytic cleavages.

in an attempt to prolong the half-lives of amidated peptides, we engineered cho cells to produce fc-peptidylglycine fusion proteins in the absence and presence of exogenous pam; both soluble and integral membrane forms of pam were tested for their ability to support fc-peptidylglycine fusion protein amidation in cho cells  <cit> . the extent of amidation observed varied from  <dig> to 90 % for different fc- peptidylglycine substrates, but the expression of exogenous pam always increased the amidation of fc- peptidylglycine substrates  <cit> . the extent of amidation never reached 100 %, which would be essential for many pharmacotherapeutic applications. it is clear that pam activity is rate-limiting for peptide amidation in cho cells, since increasing pam increased amidation  <cit> , while decreasing pam lowered the extent of amidation  <cit> .

since phm requires both copper and ascorbate to function, we explored three ways to improve the ability of cho cells to secrete amidated fc-fusion peptides. first, we used known targeting signals to try to localize integral membrane pam to different subcellular locations in cho cells expressing an fc-glp1-gly fusion protein. second, we added exogenous copper or a copper chelator to the culture medium to vary the availability of copper. third, we added exogenous ascorbate to the culture medium to see if an increase in reducing equivalents would improve fc-peptidylglycine amidation.

RESULTS
design of targeting vectors
the isoforms of pam identified in rat, mouse, human and chinese hamster encode similar soluble and integral membrane proteins. each isoform includes an n-terminal signal sequence, but the largest isoforms also include a transmembrane domain, generating type i integral membrane proteins. the trafficking of rat pam <dig> has been studied extensively in both endocrine cells, which generate soluble phm from membrane pam, and in cells which lack the proteases required to make this cleavage. pam <dig> cycles between the trans-golgi network  and the plasma membrane, returning to the tgn after endocytosis  <cit> . when expressed in endocrine cells, the phm and pal catalytic cores are efficiently packaged in secretory granules; when expressed in cho cells, both active enzymes are secreted into the medium.

we used well characterized trafficking signals to try to target pam to different subcellular locations in cho cells producing an engineered pam substrate, fc-ap-glp1-gly  <cit> . to facilitate identification of cells expressing pam and analysis of trafficking, we used egfp-tagged rat pam . since we wanted to use the same tag for each targeting vector, egfp was inserted into the linker region that separates phm from pal in pam1;  <dig> amino acids of the linker region were replaced by egfp, with no deleterious effect on either enzymatic activity  <cit> . the paired basic cleavage site present in the linker region, which allows endoproteolytic cleavage of pam <dig> in neurons and endocrine cells, was eliminated in pam/gfp. for comparison, a soluble gfp-tagged pam protein was generated by truncating pam/gfp after the catalytic core of pal .fig.  <dig> targeted pam proteins. a. diagram of pam <dig> and gfp-tagged targeted pam proteins. the regions of ergic- <dig>  galactosyl transferase  <dig>  cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and lamp <dig> used to redirect rat pam/gfp are indicated. pam820s/gfp was truncated immediately after the catalytic core of pal. b. peak rapid cells, a derivative of hek <dig> cells, were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated proteins. after 24 h, cell extracts were prepared using 20 mm nates, 10 mm mannitol, 1 % tx- <dig>  ph  <dig> ; aliquots were subjected to western blot analysis and visualized using an antibody to the phm domain. c. phm activity was measured in each cell lysate and normalized to the amount of phm protein detected on the western blot; the phm activity/phm protein ratio for pam/gfp was set to  <dig>  for each of three experiments; error bars show the standard deviation. none of the differences were significant



well characterized targeting signals known to direct proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum , tgn, endosomes  and lysosomes  were used . the cytosolic domain of pam was replaced by the cytosolic domain of ergic- <dig>  generating pam/er  <cit> . galt, a type ii integral membrane protein, is targeted to the tgn by its n-terminal transmembrane and juxtamembrane region  <cit> ; the signal sequence and pro-region of soluble pam820s/gfp were replaced by this region of galt, generating pam/tgn, a putative type ii membrane protein. for endosomal targeting, the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of pam were replaced with the corresponding regions of the cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor in pam/endo  <cit> . the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of lamp <dig> were used in a similar manner to create pam/lyso  <cit> .

to evaluate the catalytic activity of the targeted pam/gfp proteins, each was expressed transiently. cell extracts were prepared for analysis of protein integrity  and phm catalytic activity . western blot analysis using an antibody to the phm domain revealed a single major protein of the expected molecular mass in each lysate. to compare the specific activities of the targeted proteins, phm activity in each lysate  was normalized to the amount of phm protein ; data for each targeted pam protein were normalized to the value for pam/gfp analyzed at the same time . normalized to phm protein, the catalytic activities of the targeted pam proteins did not differ significantly.

analysis of cells expressing targeted pam proteins
the goal of this work was to express fc-fusion peptides in cells with no prohormone convertases , but there are few good markers of intracellular organelles in cho cells, while pituitary cells have been studied extensively. since so much is known about pam trafficking in pituitary cells  <cit> , each gfp-tagged targeted pam protein was transiently expressed in att- <dig> corticotrope tumor cells, where its localization could be compared to that of pam/gfp and established markers for cis-golgi , tgn , secretory granules  and lysosomes . pam/er accumulated in the perinuclear region . gfp and gm <dig> staining overlapped extensively, but examination of the merged image revealed that the patterns were not identical ; pam/er staining was also distinguishable from tgn <dig> staining  and the small amount of diffusely distributed pam/er staining was distinct from staining for secretory granule granules or lysosomes. much like pam/er, pam/tgn was localized to the perinuclear region, overlapping extensively with gm <dig> and tgn <dig> . examination of the merged images suggested that pam/tgn staining in the perinuclear region overlapped more with tgn <dig> than with gm <dig>  pam/lyso staining concentrated in the perinuclear area and in vesicles distributed throughout the cytosol; based on their failure to stain with antisera to lamp <dig>  these vesicles were not lysosomes . based on their localization patterns in att- <dig> cells, the trafficking signals appended to pam were only partially successful in altering its subcellular localization. significantly more vesicular staining was observed in cells expressing pam/endo . vesicular staining of pam/endo was not coincident with staining for lamp <dig>  or acth . in the perinuclear region, pam/endo staining was coincident with tgn <dig> staining , but extended beyond the structures enriched in tgn <dig>  the fact that both luminal domains of pam are efficiently packaged into secretory granules, with no added routing information  <cit> , presumably limits the extent to which membrane pam can be re-directed.fig.  <dig> att- <dig> cells expressing targeted pam constructs. a. att- <dig> cells were fixed and permeabilized 24 h after transfection; targeted pam proteins were visualized using antibody to gfp and a fitc-tagged secondary antibody ; subcellular markers were visualized using a cy3-tagged secondary antibody  and nuclei were stained using hoechst . cells expressing pam/er were stained for gm <dig> ; three cells are shown, but only two were transfected. cell expressing pam/tgn were stained for tgn <dig> . cells expressing pam/lyso were stained for lamp <dig> . cells expressing pam/endo were stained for gm <dig>  or lamp <dig> . epifluorescence images were taken using a 60x oil immersion lens; scale bar, 20 μm



analysis of stably transfected cho cell lines expressing the fc-glp1-gly fusion protein and a targeted pam protein
since each targeting vector generated an active pam protein, we next attempted to generate cho cell lines stably expressing a targeted pam protein along with substrate by introducing the targeted pam protein into cho cells stably expressing fc-glp1-gly. the sequence of glp1-gly was appended to the c-terminus of the fc region of human igg <dig>  separated by an  <dig> linker and a human rhinovirus protease cleavage site   <cit> . we obtained stable cho cell lines expressing the fc-glp1-gly fusion protein and three of the targeted pam proteins, but were unable, despite multiple attempts, to derive a stable line expressing pam/lyso. since pam/gfp localization resembled that of pam <dig>  a previously generated cho line expressing fc-glp1-gly and pam <dig> was analyzed for comparison  <cit> .

western blot analysis of cell extracts revealed the presence of proteins of the expected mass; the targeted pam proteins were recognized by antibodies to both phm and gfp . cell lysates prepared in buffer containing 1 % tx- <dig> were assayed for phm and pal activity . enzymatic activity was five to 10-fold higher in the targeted pam lines and in the previously established pam <dig> line than in the fc-glp1-gly fusion protein cell line, which expresses endogenous cho pam. phm secretion rates for the different lines were determined by assaying phm activity in spent medium and ranged from 5 %/h for pam/er and pam/tgn to 11 %/h for pam/endo and 22 %/h for pam <dig>  cell content and secretion of fc-glp1-gly fusion protein were evaluated by western blot  and quantified ; fc content and secretion rate were similar in each of the lines.fig.  <dig> stably transfected cho cell lines expressing targeted pam proteins. a. western blots for phm, gfp and γ-adaptin. b. western blot for fc in cell extracts  and spent media; human igg was analyzed as a control



localization of targeted pam proteins in stable cho cell lines
the steady state localization in cho cells of each targeted pam protein was compared to that of recognized subcellular markers for the endoplasmic reticulum , cis-golgi  and endosomes . pam/er accumulated in puncta surrounding the nucleus; staining for calnexin revealed the expected widely distributed reticular pattern, with little overlap with pam/er . staining for pam/er showed significant overlap with compartments containing giantin, but little overlap with eea <dig> containing compartments . pam/tgn also accumulated in puncta surrounding the nucleus, overlapping compartments containing giantin ; very little dispersed vesicular staining was observed. although pam/endo also accumulated in puncta surrounding the nucleus , its distribution was more widespread, with tiny puncta of staining distributed throughout the cell. co-localization of pam/endo and eea was readily apparent in these widely dispersed vesicular structures ; little overlap was observed with calnexin positive compartments, and only partial overlap with giantin positive compartments was observed . unlike the separation observed between pam/tgn or pam/endo and a cis-golgi marker  in the transiently transfected att- <dig> cells, extensive overlap of both pam/tgn and pam/endo with a cis-golgi marker  was observed in the stably transfected cho cell lines.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of targeted pam proteins. the indicated cho cell lines were fixed, permeabilized and stained simultaneously with antisera to gfp  and to the indicated subcellular markers . cells expressing pam/er were stained for gfp and calnexin  or gfp alone . cells expressing pam/tgn were stained for gfp and giantin  or for gfp alone . cells expressing pam/endo were stained for gfp and eea <dig>  or for gfp alone . epifluorescence images were taken using a 60x oil immersion lens



analysis of fc-glp <dig> fusion protein glycosylation and amidation
fc-glp <dig> fusion proteins secreted by the pam <dig> and targeted pam cho cell lines were purified using hitrap protein a cartridges. the fc region of the fc-peptidylglycine substrate includes a single n-linked oligosaccharide. evaluation of the glycan distribution of fc-ap-glp <dig> purified from cho cells expressing pam/tgn, phmcc , pam <dig> and pam/endo was determined by reverse-phase hplc-ms intact mass analysis . the patterns were complex, perhaps indicating premature fc-glp <dig> fusion protein secretion from the medial golgi  <cit>  and/or interference with normal fc glycan processing by the engineered pam proteins.

in order to facilitate analysis of α-amidation, the purified fusion proteins were cleaved using the engineered site inserted into the linker region connecting human igg <dig> to glp1-gly and the mass of the released peptide was determined by mass spectroscopy . the expression of exogenous pam increased the extent of peptide amidation from 71 % in cells only expressing endogenous cho pam to 90 % or more in all of the lines synthesizing exogenous pam . pam-tgn and pam-er cells produced amidated glp <dig> significantly more effectively than did pam <dig> cells , which suggests that slowing the progression of membrane pam through the cell improves the efficiency of the amidation process, achieving one goal of these studies.table  <dig> mass spectroscopic determination of amidation of glp <dig> by various pam proteins. fc-glp <dig> secreted by the indicated cell lines was purified using protein a; after cleavage with the rhinovirus protease  <cit> , products were subjected to mass spectroscopic analysis; data for fc-ap-glp <dig> secreted by cho cells expressing pam <dig>  pam/er, pam/tgn and pam/endo are shown. mean ± sem



to expedite analysis of fc-glp1-gly amidation, we explored the use of enzyme-linked immunoassays . a solid phase eia for glp <dig> was shown to be specific for the amidated peptide ; neither the glp1-gly precursor nor a peptide terminating with -arg-oh instead of –arg-nh <dig> was recognized. use of the glp1-nh <dig> eia to assess fc-glp <dig> amidation in spent medium was validated by exposing cho cells expressing fc-glp1-gly without or with pam <dig> to bathocuproinedisulfonate , a cell impermeant copper chelator specific for cu   <cit> . after overnight  incubation of cells with 50 μm bcs, the molar ratio of glp1-nh <dig> to fc dropped more than 20-fold for both cell lines, demonstrating the utility of the eia. notably, secretion of the fc-glp <dig> fusion protein was not affected by the presence of bcs .fig.  <dig> glp1-amide enzyme immunoassay. a. validation of glp1-amide assay using synthetic peptides. the amidated peptide representing the c-terminal half of glp <dig> diluted in parallel with the glp1-nh <dig> standard, as did culture medium from all the cho cell lines producing fc-glp1-gly . both the gly-extended glp <dig> and the des-gly peptide  showed no cross-reactivity in the assay. b. cho cells expressing ap-glp1-gly  or ap-glp1-gly and pam <dig>  were plated onto 12-well plates and incubated with control medium or medium containing 50 μm bcs for 16 h; spent media and cells were harvested and subjected to western blot analysis for fc and eia for glp1-nh <dig>  the molar ratio of glp1-nh <dig> to fc is shown. c. western blot for fc from one of the experiments included in , demonstrating the lack of toxicity of the bcs treatment. d. dose response for bcs, demonstrating the similar effect of bcs on the ability of endogenous cho pam and exogenous pam <dig> to produce amidated glp1-nh2; average of  <dig> assays



we next compared the ability of different concentrations of bcs to limit the amidation of fc-glp <dig> produced in cho cells lacking exogenous pam and in cho cells expressing pam <dig> . in both lines, fc-glp <dig> amidation was almost entirely prevented by incubation of the cells with medium containing 10 μm bcs. the sensitivity of endogenous cho cell pam and exogenous rat pam <dig> to bcs was similar.

analysis of fc-nmu and fc-pyy fusion protein amidation
since fc-nmu-gly and fc-pyy-gly are amidated less extensively than fc-glp1-gly when expressed in cho cells  <cit> , we evaluated the ability of commercially available eia kits for these peptides to distinguish the amidated peptide from its precursor . the nmu eia recognized nmu <dig> and nmu <dig> equally, even though only the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of nmu <dig> are present in nmu <dig>  longer nmu peptides with a –gly residue appended to the –asn that is normally amidated gave only partial cross-reactivity . consistent with the fact that mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that ~70 % of the fc-nmu-gly secreted by cho cells expressing only endogenous pam was amidated  <cit> , samples of spent medium from cho cells expressing fc-nmu-gly with the ala-pro or the gly-gly-ser linker generated competition curves parallel to those of amidated nmu. as for fc-glp <dig> amidation, growth of cho cells in medium containing increasing concentrations of bcs eliminated the ability of the spent medium to generate competition curves parallel to that of the nmu standard; instead, partial competition was observed, with a curve resembling that generated by the gs-nmu-gly peptide . based on these observations, we concluded that amidated fc-nmu fusion protein was no longer being secreted.fig.  <dig> nmu and pyy enzyme immunoassays require amidation for full cross-reactivity. a. characterization of nmu-amide assay using synthetic peptides. left: the medium from pam/820 s cells exhibited a dilution pattern parallel to the amidated standard peptide. synthetic nmu-8-nh <dig>  was almost identical to the full 25-residue nmu-nh <dig> in the assay . by contrast, the gly-extended synthetic peptide and cho medium from pam/820 s cells after bcs treatment showed similar flat, partial dilution curves. right: bcs in a dose-dependent manner inhibited the amidation of nmu by the pam/820 s cells, using data from  <dig> to 6 μl of medium. secretion of fc-nmu was not affected . b. left: characterization of pyy-amide assay using synthetic peptides. left: medium from cho cells expressing pam <dig> diluted in parallel with the authentic pyy-nh <dig> standard, while the gly-extended peptide and medium from bcs-treated cells exhibited a much flatter dilution profile. right: 50 μm bcs inhibited amidation of pyy, using data from  <dig>  to 2 μl medium. for both nmu and pyy, data from several assays were normalized using their respective standards to enable the comparisons



we next assessed the ability of an eia for pyy to distinguish between amidated pyy and pyy-gly . as for nmu, the assay for pyy showed partial cross-reactivity with pyy-gly. samples of spent medium from cho cells expressing fc-pyy-gly generated curves parallel to those of amidated pyy and easily distinguishable from those of non-amidated pyy-gly. spent medium samples from cho cells expressing fc-pyy-gly and kept in medium containing bcs generated competition curves more parallel to those generated by pyy-gly than the full competition curve generated by amidated pyy ; inclusion of 50 μm bcs in the medium largely abolished secretion of the fully reactive pyy peptide.

enhancing fc-peptidylglycine amidation
since pam requires copper and consumes ascorbate, we explored the possibility that providing increased amounts of either required component might increase the ability of cho cells to secrete amidated fusion protein. the concentration of copper in dmem/f- <dig> is  <dig> nm . although cultured cells maintained in concentrations of cuso <dig> as high as 10 μm grow normally  <cit> , addition of this level of exogenous cuso <dig> to spent medium from cho cells producing phmcc demonstrated that phmcc was rapidly inactivated . we therefore asked whether a more modest increase in cu levels in the culture medium promoted amidation . cho cells expressing fc-peptide-gly were incubated in dmem/f- <dig> medium containing  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> nm additional cuso <dig> for 16 h. based on eia data and western blot analysis of the secreted product, the extent of amidation of fc-glp <dig>  fc-pyy and fc-nmu was not altered by the addition of cuso <dig> fig.  <dig> varying copper and ascorbate concentrations. a. copper. adding small amounts of cuso <dig> did not increase amidation of glp <dig> by endogenous cho cell pam or by exogenous pam <dig>  the amidation of nmu by exogenous pam/820 s, or the amidation of pyy by exogenous pam <dig>  the base medium contained  <dig> nm cu . b. ascorbate. adding a concentration of ascorbate equivalent to normal plasma levels   <cit>  did not increase amidation of glp <dig>  nmu or pyy by the same cell lines as in . the base medium did not contain ascorbic acid. for all three peptides, data from several assays were pooled



although cho cells express gulonolactone oxidase  and thus do not have the same genetic block to ascorbate synthesis present in humans and some other mammals, we next asked whether provision of additional ascorbate could increase the extent of fc-peptide amidation. cells were maintained in medium containing  <dig> or 50 μm ascorbate for 16 h; cells and media were harvested and eias and western blots were carried out. the provision of additional ascorbate had no significant effect on the extent of amidation of fc-glp1-gly, fc-nmu-gly or fc-pyy-gly . blood levels of ascorbate are around 50 μm  <cit> , and 50 μm ascorbate restores peptide amidation in rat pituitary cells maintained in serum-free medium  <cit> .

discussion
chinese hamster ovary cells are used to produce >70 % of all biopharmaceuticals  <cit> . it is now clear that cho cells producing monoclonal antibodies catalyze their α-amidation to varying extents . unlike monoclonal antibodies, where amidation could impair optimal functionality  <cit> , we investigated methods that would maximize the amidation of fc-peptidylglycine fusion proteins, wherein amidation would increase the biological potency of the product peptide. the only enzyme which can amidate the cooh-terminus of peptides is pam  <cit> . in most neuroendocrine cells the extent of peptide amidation is close to 100 %, even with only one functional allele of pam  <cit> . in neuroendocrine cells, most peptide amidation occurs in large dense core vesicles, which are stored for periods of many days, allowing plenty of time to complete the amidation process  <cit> . cho cells lack such long-term storage sites, so pam was targeted to various intracellular sites in an attempt to increase the access of pam to its peptidylglycine substrates and maximize the extent of amidation.

targeting pam to different locations in the cell turned out to be more difficult than anticipated. when preceded by the pam signal sequence, expression of the protease resistant catalytic cores of phm and pal yields active enzyme that is rapidly secreted by cho cells  <cit>  or efficiently stored in the secretory granules of att- <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, pam <dig> is largely localized to the tgn area in both cell types; in the perinuclear region of att- <dig> cells, pam <dig> has been identified in vesicular components of both the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . truncation of pam <dig> immediately after the stop transfer signal that follows its transmembrane domain  yields a protein that cannot undergo endocytosis and accumulates on the cell surface  <cit> ; this observation highlights the essential role played by endocytic trafficking in localizing membrane pam. the fact that pam <dig> fused to er, endosomal or tgn targeting signals localized primarily to the perinuclear trans-golgi network region is consistent with a major role for the luminal domains of pam in controlling its endocytic trafficking  <cit> . a strong influence of the luminal domain on efforts to redirect proteins to novel subcellular locations is well established  <cit> . the specific activity of phm did not differ when it was part of pam/tgn, a typeii integral membrane protein or part of pam <dig>  pam/er, pam/endo or pam/lyso, which are all type i integral membrane proteins .

each method for determining the extent of peptide amidation has its advantages and drawbacks. the mass spectrometry approach provides data for both the nonamidated and amidated peptide in a single run, but the relative recovery of the two peptides  is difficult to assess without synthetic standards for every case. the eia is very selective for the amidated end  and western blots allow assessment of protein stability. the large dynamic range of the genegnome facilitates analysis, but the dilutions needed for the eia complicate the analysis.

our data suggest that pam speeds the rate of trafficking of the fc-peptides through the secretory pathway, at least for the pam <dig> and pam/tgn lines . this change may parallel the changes seen in the trafficking of soluble products derived from pro-opiomelanocortin in pituitary corticotropes, where expressing pam <dig> increases the rate of basal secretion  <cit> . like chromogranin a, phm and pal are efficiently targeted to secretory granules in corticotrope tumor cells. while expression of exogenous chromogranin a in non-endocrine cells causes the formation of granule-like structures  <cit> , neither expression of phmcc, pam820s or pam <dig> caused granule formation in cho cells.

although extensive amidation of the fc-ap-glp1-gly substrate occurred in cells expressing only endogenous cho pam, expression of exogenous pam <dig> or targeted pam did significantly increase the percentage of substrate that was amidated. efforts were made to determine what factors control the extent of amidation of the fc-peptide substrates. as expected, removal of copper blocked amidation. although copper-dependent, pam does not bind copper tightly, making it susceptible to copper chelators. this raised the possibility that increasing copper delivery to pam could increase peptide amidation. however, the nanomolar levels of copper in dmem/f <dig>  appear to be adequate; raising the copper concentration in the medium five-fold had no effect on the extent of amidation. higher levels of copper inactivated phm and oxidized the secreted fc peptides.

since cho cells express gulonolactone oxidase, they can synthesize ascorbate and are not dependent on acquiring it from the medium; consistent with this fact, supplying additional  ascorbate did not increase the extent to which any of the fc-peptidylglycine substrates was amidated. in contrast, all human cells and rodent neurons and endocrine cells rely on ascorbate taken up from their environment. dmem/f <dig> does not contain ascorbate, and peptide amidation by rat pituitary cells maintained in serum-free medium is dependent on exogenous ascorbate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
elimination of cho cell pam expression and activity would avoid unintended amidation , which may have a therapeutic benefit   <cit> . however, there are apparently no adverse consequences of having a portion of the monoclonal antibodies amidated, since that is also true of antibodies produced endogenously  <cit> . the point of these studies was to determine whether cho cells expressing pam and a fc-peptide substrate could be made to amidate a high percentage of the fc-fusion peptide, for the purpose of producing biopharmaceuticals, and the answer is quite clearly in the affirmative. the broad specificity of pam and its ability to function when traversing the cell surface or when targeted to the endocytic pathway raise the possibility of using pam to catalyze other modifications of exogenously supplied substrates.
