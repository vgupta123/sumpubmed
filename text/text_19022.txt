BACKGROUND
plants are frequently challenged by unfavorable environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures, drought, and high salinity. upon exposure to harmful environmental conditions, many related genes are induced  <cit> . transcription factors  are one such related gene family. numerous studies demonstrated that tfs play vital roles in plant gene regulation, either activating or preventing target gene expression  <cit> . among tfs families, nac tfs and their corresponding cis-acting sequences act as molecular switches to regulate temporal and spatial gene expression  <cit> .

the nac superfamily is one of the largest tf families in plants. most nac proteins share a highly conserved nac domain at the n-terminal, and a diversified activation domain at the c-terminal  <cit> . nac tfs play a vital role in various plant developmental processes, including leaf senescence, phytohormone homeostasis, and responses to unfavorable environmental stresses  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, overexpression of anac <dig>  anac <dig>  rd26/anac <dig>  and ataf1/anac <dig> confer drought tolerance  <cit> . plants overexpressing ataf2/anac <dig> have a greater susceptibility to fusarium oxysporum  <cit> . overexpression of jub1/anac <dig> and vni2/anac <dig> delays senescence and enhances resistance to abiotic stresses  <cit> . in rice , overexpression of osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  and osnac <dig> significantly enlarges roots, and thereby enhances tolerance to drought stress, furthermore, these transgenic rice plants produce a higher grain yield under field conditions . osnac <dig> overexpression in rice enhances tolerances to salt, drought, and low temperature stresses, but in this case the transgenic rice exhibits low grain yield and growth retardation  <cit> . overexpressing osnac <dig> in rice enhances salt and drought tolerance  <cit> . when the rice stress-responsive nac gene snac <dig> was introduced into rice and wheat, the transgenic plants displayed significantly enhanced tolerances to multiple abiotic stresses  <cit> . kaneda et al.  <cit>  revealed that overexpression of osnac <dig> leads to hypersensitive cell death, whereas, in osnac <dig> knock-down transgenic lines, hypersensitive cell death is significantly reduced. osnac <dig> and osnac <dig> proteins are involved in the response to infection by magnaporthe grisea, and may play a role in the phytohormone-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> .

compared with arabidopsis, rice, and other species, there have been fewer investigations into nac in wheat. in bread wheat , transgenic lines overexpressing tanac <dig> produce more biomass in the shoot and root when grown under stress-inducing conditions  <cit> . overexpression of tanac <dig>  tanac2a, and tanac <dig> in plants improves tolerances to low temperature, high salinity, and drought stresses . quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  assays suggested that tanac <dig>  tanac <dig>  ttnamb- <dig>  and tanac69- <dig> participate in responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses . overall, these studies demonstrated that the factors mostly affecting expression of nac genes are salt, drought, and extreme temperatures; and several nac genes are simultaneously co-expressed in a developmental/organ-specific way.

in this study, a novel nac transcription factor gene tanac <dig> was cloned from wheat. gene expression pattern analysis demonstrated that tanac <dig> was upregulated by high salinity, dehydration, aba, and h2o <dig> treatments. tanac <dig> enhanced tolerance to high salinity and drought stress in transgenic arabidopsis, and exhibited an aba-hypersensitive response. morphological assays revealed that overexpression of tanac <dig> delayed bolting and flowering. our results provide evidence that tanac <dig> participates in the aba signal pathway, and plays important roles in stress responses and developmental processes.

RESULTS
tanac <dig> encodes a plant-specific nac transcription factor
a novel nac gene was cloned from bread wheat. this gene was designated as tanac <dig> as it had high homology to nac <dig> from aegilops tauschii. it is established that spontaneous hybridization of the wild grass aegilops tauschii  with cultivated wheat triticum turgidum  resulted in t. aestivum   <cit> . moreover, the ae. tauschii genome has been sequenced, and  <dig> tfs in  <dig> families, including the nac family, have been identified  <cit> . the full length cdna of tanac <dig> is 1198 bp long with a 1074 bp open reading frame , and encodes a protein with a predicted relative molecular mass of  <dig>  kda.

sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis  revealed that tanac <dig> had 96 % identity to w5bnh <dig>  from t. aestivum, 92 % identity to hvnac <dig>  from hordeum vulgare, and 89 % identity to nac <dig>  from ae. tauschii. additionally, tanac <dig> had relative high homology with osnac <dig>  and anac <dig> , demonstrating their biological functions  <cit> . as there was high identity between tanac <dig> and w5bnh <dig>  nucleic acid sequence alignment was conducted. this revealed that, including the orf and untranslated region , tanac <dig> was  <dig>  % identical to w5bnh <dig> . comparison results indicated that tanac <dig> and w5bnh <dig> may be the same gene, and similar to w5bnh <dig>  the novel tanac <dig> might be located on the 2bs chromosome. to further verify if tanac <dig> and w5bnh <dig> were the same gene, a wheat whole-genome survey was performed using the tanac <dig> sequence, and the dna sequence with the highest identity to tanac <dig> detected. use of a dna splicing program revealed that, excluding the intron, this cdna sequence was the same with the w5bnh <dig> sequence. therefore, the whole-genome survey indicated that tanac <dig> gene might be the same gene with w5bnh <dig>  to further examine whether slight differences existed, two tanac genes were selected from ncbi for a blastn against embl; this revealed that tanac2d  and tanac <dig>  shared  <dig>  and 98 % identity to wheat whole-genome cdnas, respectively. the slight difference between tanac <dig> and w5bnh <dig> may be a result of the different wheat cultivars used.

tanac <dig> contains a typical nac structure with a conserved nac domain  including five subdomains  consistent with nac conserved domain characteristics. four l motifs were identified at the divergent c-terminal region  using the multiple em for motif elicitation  tool . transactivation activity assays confirmed that tanac <dig> was a transcriptional activator, and the c-terminal region possessed transcriptional activation activity . kjaersgaard et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the l motif is sufficient for transactivation activity of hvnac <dig>  therefore, to further investigate the function of the l motif, the transactivation activity of seven truncated versions of tanac <dig> was examined. among these, six truncated versions containing the l motif had transactivation activity, whereas the tanac291– <dig> fragment without the l motif had no transactivation activity , suggesting that the l motif plays an important role in transactivation activity. expression of a tanac29-gfp fusion protein in wheat mesophyll protoplasts demonstrated that the green fluorescent protein  and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  were confined to the nucleus ; this is consistent with its function as a transcription regulator. moreover, pondr vl <dig> analysis  <cit>  indicated that the c-terminal region of tanac <dig> was intrinsically disordered  to a large degree , suggesting that the protein was largely unfolded in the c-terminal region.

expression of tanac <dig> is upregulated by abiotic stresses and signal molecules
temporal and spatial expression analyses revealed that tanac <dig> had relatively higher expression levels in the leaf, stem, flag leaf, and stamen, with the highest expression levels occurring in the leaf. however, tanac <dig> expressed at very low levels in the root, pistil, embryo, endosperm, coleoptile, and caryopsis . tanac <dig> transcripts were much higher in mature senescing leaves than in young green leaves. this suggests that tanac <dig> might be involved in the senescence process in wheat.

to investigate the response of tanac <dig> to abiotic stresses, tanac <dig> expression levels were examined following nacl, peg <dig>  h2o <dig> and aba treatments. qrt-pcr analysis revealed that tanac <dig> was greatly upregulated by nacl, peg <dig>  aba, and h2o <dig> treatments in the leaf, and by nacl, peg <dig>  and aba treatments in the root; it was only slightly upregulated by h2o <dig> in the root . interestingly, the expression level increase in the root was stronger than in the leaf following nacl and peg treatments, suggesting a close correlation with a relative low organ-specific expression in the root. these qrt-pcr results strongly suggest that tanac <dig>  like other stress-associated nac genes  <cit> , participates in plant stress responses.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of tanac <dig> in wheat after stress treatments. expression patterns of tanac <dig> in wheat leaves and roots after nacl, peg <dig>  aba and h2o <dig> treatments by qrt-pcr analysis. leaf and root were collected after different stress treatment. the 2−ΔΔct method was used in qrt-pcr analysis. transcript levels were normalized to taactin. values are means ± se of three replicates. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from mock . three independent experiments were performed



salt and drought tolerances of tanac29-overexpression plants
transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated to explore the functions of tanac <dig>  seven transgenic lines  were confirmed through kanamycin resistance analysis. among these, three overexpression  lines, designated oe <dig>  oe <dig>  and oe <dig>  showed higher tanac <dig> expression levels by semi-quantitative analysis . when grown in soil, phenotypes of the tanac29-overexpression plants were not significantly different from the wild type  at the vegetative phase, but showed delayed bolting and flowering at the reproductive stage under normal growth conditions . this delayed phenotype was similar to those observed in jub1- and ataf1-overexpressing plants  <cit> .

next, tanac29-overexpression plants were examined for tolerance to salt stress. twenty-five-day-old seedlings, grown in soil, were irrigated with 250 mm nacl solution for 4 weeks , wt and vector control  plants had a survival rate of ~20 %, while tanac <dig> overexpressing lines had survival rates of over 80 % . when 45-day-old and 65-day-old seedlings were treated for 21 days  in the same way, all wt and vc plants died, whereas oe <dig> plants still had a survival rate of over 50 % under these conditions . this indicated that overexpression of tanac <dig> could greatly enhance tolerance to salt stress.fig.  <dig> the tanac29-overexpression  lines have enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress. a phenotypes of wt, vc  and oe plants grown on salt soil supplemented with 250 mm nacl in different growth stage, including  25-day-old seedling,  45-day-old seedling and  65-day-old seedling. b phenotypes of wt, vc and oe plants treated with drought stress at different growth stage, including  25-day-old seedling and  65-day-old seedling. c quantitative analysis of survival rate of 25-day-old seedling after salt and drought stresses. values are means ± se of three replicates. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from wt 



to investigate the drought stress response of the tanac29-overexpression lines, twenty-five-day-old seedlings at the vegetative phase, were subjected to drought stress through withholding water for  <dig> d, followed by re-watering for  <dig> d. approximately 50 % of oe <dig> plants recovered from a dying status, whereas the survival rate for both wt and vc plants was ~15 % . when 65-day-old seedlings at the reproductive stage were treated in the same way, most transgenic lines still survived, but only 20 % of wt plants were recovered . these observations indicated that overexpression of tanac <dig> could confer resistance to drought stress. finally, statistical analysis of survival rate of 25-day-old seedling after salt and drought stresses revealed that over 50 % of transgenic plants were still alive, whereas ~85 % of wt and vc plants died .

to further verify whether tanac29-overexpressing plants with enhanced drought stress were associated with transpiration, the phenotype of detached leaves was examined by air-drying in a 25 °c environment. after  <dig> or 7 h, the leaves of wt and vc had severely curved, whereas the transgenic plant leaves displayed a slightly curled phenotype . water loss rate assays revealed that tanac29-overexpression lines had a lower rate of water loss at each time point , thus rendering tanac <dig> transgenic plants more tolerant to drought stress.

stress tolerance of plants overexpressing tanac <dig> was further examined by root length analysis. transgenic plants had a longer root than wt under drought stress conditions . when grown on 1/ <dig> murashige-skoog  medium containing 120 mm nacl, the growth of the primary roots of tanac29-overexpression line seedlings was significantly stronger than observed in wt and vc after  <dig> d of treatment . a dehydration assay indicated that tanac <dig> transgenic lines exhibited enhanced tolerance on 1/ <dig> ms medium containing 400 mm mannitol, at both  <dig> and  <dig> d after treatment . these results further demonstrated that tanac29-overexpression lines had increased tolerance to salt and drought stresses.fig.  <dig> root length assays of wt, vc  and overexpression  lines. a phenotypes of wt, vc and oe plants grown for  <dig> d on medium supplemented with  <dig> or 120 mm nacl  and primary root length . b phenotypes of wt, vc and oe plants grown for  <dig> and  <dig> d on medium supplemented with  <dig> or 400 mm mannitol  and primary root length . values are means ± se  in root length assays. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from wt 



tanac29-overexpressing plants exhibit aba-hypersensitive response
whether salt and drought tolerances of tanac29-overexpression line plants was associated with aba was tested by measuring root length. when grown on 1/ <dig> ms medium containing 10 μm aba, exogenous aba inhibited root growth of tanac29-overexpression line seedlings more severely than observed in wt and vc, suggesting that tanac <dig> transgenic lines were hypersensitive to aba . seed germination and seedling emergence  rate assays were performed to further verify the aba hypersensitivity of tanac <dig> transgenic lines. as shown in fig. 4b−i, when grown on 1/ <dig> ms medium without aba, there was no significant difference in seedling emergence between wt, vc, and transgenic seeds. however, the seedling emergence rate of wt and vc was higher than those of transgenic seeds on 1/ <dig> ms medium containing 2 μm aba . additionally, transgenic lines grown on aba-containing medium had shorter roots than those of wt and vc . these observations indicated that tanac <dig> transgenic lines displayed aba hypersensitivity during post-germination growth, suggesting that tanac <dig> was positively regulated by aba.fig.  <dig> hypersensitivity of tanac29-overexpression  lines to aba. a phenotypes of wt, vc  and oe plants grown for  <dig> d on medium supplemented with  <dig> or 10 μm aba  and primary root length . values are means ± se . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from wt . b seedlings of wt, vc and tanac29-overexpression lines observed  <dig> d after germination on 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with  <dig> or 2 μm aba  and quantitative analysis of seedling emergence rate . values are means ± se . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from wt . comparison of root length of wt, vc and tanac29-overexpression lines . three independent experiments were performed, each evaluating  <dig> to  <dig> seeds



expression of related marker genes under salt and drought stresses
to further understand the molecular basis of tanac <dig> function, the expression levels of related marker genes were analyzed. the expression levels of most related marker genes were significantly lower in tanac29-overexpression line plants than in wt plants . the transcript level of rd29b   <cit>  increased 72-fold in wt under drought stress conditions, this was much greater than observed in tanac29-overexpression line plants , indicating that tanac <dig> might participate in the aba signal pathway. as indicators for leaf senescence, relative expressions of sag <dig>   <cit>  and sag <dig>   <cit>  were lower in tanac29-overexpression line plants than in wt plants following salt and drought stresses , suggesting that tanac <dig> overexpression delayed leaf senescence effects of abiotic stresses. aib <dig> , a negative regulator of jasmonic acid  signaling  <cit> , was only slightly affected by salt and drought stresses . the expression levels of erd <dig>   <cit>  and abi <dig>   <cit>  significantly increased in wt plants, but were only slightly changed in plants overexpressing tanac <dig> . taken together, these results demonstrated that tanac <dig> was involved in regulating the expression of some key aba signaling regulators and senescence-associated genes.fig.  <dig> expression pattern of relevant genes  in wt and tanac29-overexpression  plants. seedlings of wt and oe were treated with 250 mm salt stress for  <dig> d and drought stress for  <dig> d, respectively. total rnas were extracted from leaves, and qrt-pcr analysis was performed. the 2−ΔΔct method was used in qrt-pcr analysis. values are means ± se of three replicates. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from wt . three independent biological experiments were performed



variations of chlorophyll, h2o <dig>  and malondialdehyde  content, of electrolytic leakage, and catalase , superoxide dismutase , and peroxidase  activities under salt and drought stresses
abiotic stress can increase the accumulation of reactive oxygen species , leading to increased oxidative stress  <cit> . to estimate the level of abiotic stress damage to plant material, related physiological indices in wt and transgenic lines at different time points after stress treatment were measured. under salt stress, the decrease in chlorophyll content was greater in wt plants than in tanac29-overexpression lines . there was no significant difference in h2o <dig> accumulation, relative electrolytic leakage, and mda content between wt plants and tanac29-overexpressing lines under normal conditions . however, under salt and drought stresses, wt plants showed a greater accumulation of h2o <dig> than transgenic lines at all time points. this demonstrated that wt plants were more seriously damaged, and overexpression of tanac <dig> protected transgenic lines from abiotic stress. the electrolytic leakage of the wt plants and tanac29-overexpression lines increased significantly, though the increment of the wt was higher than observed in transgenic lines, suggesting increased membrane damage might lead to increased solute leakage. mda content was significantly lower in tanac29-overexpression lines than in wt plants under stress conditions, indicating that the transgenic plants produced less ros.fig.  <dig> analysis of physiological indices under salt stress conditions. analysis of chlorophyll content , electrolyte leakage , mda content , h2o <dig> content  and sod , cat , pod  activities in wt and tanac29-overexpression  lines under normal and 250 mm salt stress conditions. seedlings leaves were sampled from wt and tanac29-overexpression lines at  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> dat to detect physiological indices. values are means ± se of three replicates. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from wt

to further estimate antioxidant enzyme activities, the relative activities of cat, sod, and pod  <cit>  in wt and tanac29-overexpression lines were measured at different time points following stress treatments. the enzyme activity of sod in tanac29-overexpression plants was significantly higher than in wt plants after subjection to salt and drought stresses , suggesting more superoxide radicals were converted into o <dig> and h2o <dig> via sod catalysis in transgenic plants  <cit> . cat is an important antioxidant enzyme involved in h2o <dig> detoxification  <cit> , levels decreased significantly in wt plants but only slightly changed in tanac29-overexpression lines following salt stress , indicating that tanac29-overexpression lines scavenged more h2o <dig>  pod activity in wt plants and tanac29-overexpression lines significantly increased, yet the increment had no significant difference after salt and drought stresses . the higher antioxidant activity of enzymes in transgenic plants may lead to greater scavenging of ros, thus increasing the survival rates of the transgenic plants  <cit> . these results demonstrated that tanac29-overexpression lines increased resistance to salt and drought stresses through greater scavenging of ros.

discussion
tanac <dig> plays important roles in abiotic stress response and senescence
the tanac29-overexpression plants had significantly increased tolerance to salt and drought stresses. numerous studies show that nac tfs play critical roles in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . ataf <dig>  anac <dig>  anac <dig>  and rd <dig> all enhance tolerance to drought stress  <cit> . overexpression of snac <dig>  osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  and osnac <dig> results in enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses . tanac <dig> confers significant enhancement of drought tolerance in transgenic wheat  <cit> . overexpression of tanac <dig>  tanac2a, and tanac <dig> in transgenic plants improves tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses . the expression level of tanac <dig> was much higher in senescent leaves, indicating that tanac <dig> maybe also involved in leaf senescence. in arabidopsis, anac <dig>  atnap/anac <dig>  ataf <dig>  and ore1/anac <dig> act as positive regulators of leaf senescence , whereas, jub <dig> and vni <dig> act as negative regulators of leaf senescence  <cit> ; plants overexpressing these genes exhibit a delayed senescence phenotype  <cit> , similar to the tanac29-overexpression lines. interestingly, these senescence associated nac tfs are also involved in abiotic stresses. anac016-overexpression plants have low drought tolerance  <cit> , and jub1-overexpression lines have enhanced tolerance to salt and h2o2-induced oxidative stresses  <cit> . thus, these senescence associated nac tfs play important roles in the crosstalk between leaf senescence and the abiotic stress response, and it is likely that tanac <dig> has a similar role in wheat.

the overexpression of numerous genes enhances tolerance to abiotic stresses; and overexpression of key genes regulates the relative expression levels of other marker genes  <cit> . rd29b is an aba-responsive marker gene in the snrk2s pathway, and is induced by abiotic stress  <cit> . lu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that 35s-abi <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants grow better than wt under high c/low n stress conditions, while rd29b relative expression in transgenic arabidopsis is significantly lower than observed in wt plants under high c/low c conditions. yang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that rd29b transcript levels gradually increased during leaf senescence, similar to vni <dig> expression. our results of rd29b relative expression are similar to these reports. sag <dig> expression levels were significantly reduced in tanac29-overexpressing plants, suggesting that tanac <dig> is involved in the regulation of sag <dig> expression. compared with wt plants, sag <dig> knockout plants show less water loss, more sensitive to aba, delayed leaf senescence, and enhanced tolerance to drought stress  <cit> ; this is similar to the tanac29-overexpression line plants. thus, down-regulation of sag <dig> expression in plants overexpressing tanac <dig> likely contributed to the enhanced salt and drought stresses tolerance observed.

tanac <dig> participates in the aba-mediated pathway in stress tolerance
aba is an important signaling molecule involved in plant responses to many unfavorable environmental stresses, including high salinity, drought, and extreme temperature  <cit> , indeed, aba is often considered as the second messenger. our results demonstrated that plants overexpressing tanac <dig> had enhanced tolerance to salt and drought, and exhibited hypersensitivity to aba. this increased sensitivity to aba might be a result of lower transpiration rates and faster stomatal closure in tanac29-overexpression plants, leading to lower water loss and enhanced tolerance. a close relationship between aba-hypersensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance has been demonstrated. for example, overexpression of k+uptake transporter  <dig>  in arabidopsis exhibits increased aba sensitivity through faster stomatal closure and enhanced tolerance to drought stress  <cit> . conversely, mutation in arabidopsis more axillary growth  <dig> , max <dig>  and max <dig> genes results in reduced aba sensitivity, impaired aba-mediated stomatal closing, and decreased survival rates under drought stress  <cit> . numerous studies have revealed how abiotic stresses trigger signal transductions necessary for plant survival via aba and other phytohormone signal molecules. in arabidopsis, ataf <dig> acts as a positive regulator of aba biosynthesis  <cit> . conversely, ataf <dig> expression is induced by methyl jasmonate  and salicylic acid, but is independent of aba signaling  <cit> . plants overexpressing ataf <dig>  anac <dig>  rd <dig>  and osnap show enhanced tolerance to drought, but increased sensitivity to aba  <cit> . overexpression of anac <dig> and anac <dig> increases ja-induced expression of defense genes  <cit> . ntm2/anac069-mediated salt signaling in seed germination is not related to aba and gibberellin , meaning ntm <dig> acts independently of the aba signal  <cit> . vni <dig> is induced by high salinity in an aba-dependent manner; this gene delays leaf aging and senescence  <cit> . thus, many genes participating in the aba signaling transduction network, such as pp2cs, snrk2s, nac, and wrky, are responsive to external influences  <cit> . hence, the aba hypersensitivity of tanac <dig> suggests that tanac <dig> is involved in cellular network cross-talk between the aba signal pathway and the abiotic stress-induced metabolic pathway.

the antioxidant mechanism is involved in tanac <dig> conferring salt and drought stresses tolerance
abiotic stress can lead to oxidation damage and membrane lipid peroxidation in plants  <cit> . therefore, the h2o <dig> content often increases under stress conditions. in arabidopsis, h2o <dig> treatment increases jub <dig> and ataf <dig> transcript abundance  <cit> . plants overexpressing jub <dig> counteract cellular accumulation of h2o <dig>  having decreased h2o <dig> levels and an enhanced tolerance to salt stress  <cit> . in contrast, ataf1-overexpression plants accumulate significantly higher h2o <dig> than wt plants; ataf <dig> mutant plants accumulate less h2o <dig> and display delayed senescence  <cit> . tanac29-overexpression plants also accumulated less h2o <dig> and had enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses. mda is often increased under stress conditions, and ros can be produced by membrane lipid peroxidation thus affecting protein synthesis and stability in plants  <cit> . hence, the extent of membrane lipid peroxidation was used to assess the severity of oxidation stress. antioxidant enzymes such as cat, sod, and pod play an important role in scavenging ros  <cit> . these antioxidant enzymes are often upregulated to defend protein systems after stress, however, several studies have demonstrated that activities of these antioxidant enzymes decline under salt and drought stresses over long time treatment conditions, suggesting that the defense mechanism of these antioxidant enzymes may have been destroyed  <cit> . thus, together with the higher enzyme activities of sod or cat , most tanac29-overexpression plants still survived under salt and drought stresses conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, tanac <dig> was upregulated by various abiotic stresses, and played important roles in senescence and tolerance to high salinity and drought. it was demonstrated that tanac <dig> participates in the aba-mediated pathway, and activates antioxidant enzymes to improve plant tolerances. these findings shed some light on the complex mechanisms and role of nac in a plant’s response to environmental stresses.
