BACKGROUND
esterases , lipases  and phospholipase, commonly referred to as lipolytic enzymes, principally catalyze the hydrolysis and synthesis of acyl glycerides and other fatty acid esters  <cit> . lipolytic enzymes produced from psychrophilic microorganisms in cold environment could be active and stable at low temperatures as compared to mesophilic enzymes. esterases have gained immense importance in pharmaceutical, polymer, food, flavor, oleochemical, biofuel and detergent industries  <cit> . the high catalytic activity of these lipolytic enzymes at low temperatures make these more useful for commercial applications  <cit> . recently, many cold-active lipolytic enzymes from psychrophiles and psychrotrophs have been discovered and characterized . in esterses, the catalytic triad is commonly formed by ser, his and asp residues followed the order ser-asp-his and the nucleophilic serine residue is usually embedded in a conserved pentapeptide motif   <cit> . in the past decade, a quick progress achieved in the production of recombinant esterases by directed evolution, mutagenesis, structural analysis, protein engineering  <cit> . therefore, attempts have been made to enhance the thermo-stability of lipolytic enzymes by directed evolution  <cit> . the directed evolution is generally used to generate desired variants and investigate the relationship of structure-function without any detailed structure information  <cit> . directed evolution creates molecular diversity by various methods such as error-prone pcr, site-specific saturation mutagenesis and dna shuffling . recently, an esterase of pig liver origin mutated at f407i was used to resolve the racemic mixture of clopidogrel  <cit> . our previous studies also confirmed that a cold active esterase , produced from psychrobacter pacificensis, was salt tolerant, highly active at low temperatures, and its biochemical characteristics made it important for commercial applications  <cit> . serratia is a genus of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria and is also a well-known source for chitinase production  <cit> . only few reports of esterase from serratia sp. are available in literature.

in this study, a gene encoding a cold-active esterase, termed ests, was cloned from the marine bacterium serratia sp. and expressed in e. coli. the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized. furthermore, the effect of altered amino acid on the thermo-stability of esterase was studied by 3d structural model of esterase and circular dichroism  analysis.

RESULTS
gene cloning and sequence analysis
the esterase gene, ests, was successfully cloned from serratia sp. genomic dna. the gene was 909 bp long and encoded a protein  of  <dig> amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the signalp  <dig>  server predicted no signal peptide for ests. blastp revealed that the translated protein sequences of ests showed a high sequence identity to esterase  from serratia liquefaciens atcc  <dig> , esterase  from serratia liquefaciens fk <dig> , and esterase  from serratia grimesii . a multiple sequence alignment of ests was performed with thermophilic carboxylesterase est <dig>  from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius , esterase peste  from pyrobaculum calidifontis , carboxylesterase este <dig>  from a metagenomic library , esterase lpest <dig>  from lactobacillus plantarum , and all of them were retrieved using blastp in the ncbi and pdb database . the classical catalytic triad consisting of ser  <dig>  asp  <dig> and his  <dig> was identified and the active site ser  <dig> residue was located within the conserved pentapeptide motif .fig.  <dig> multiple alignments of ests and other four esterases. the four esterases are est <dig>  from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, peste  from pyrobaculum calidifontis, este <dig>  from a metagenomic library and lpest <dig>  from lactobacillus plantarum. the identical and conserved residues are shaded. the conserved g–x–s–x–g motif and the catalytic triad  were indicated by red box and black triangle, respectively



screening of random mutant library
screening of random mutant library was based on retention of esterase activity after incubation at high temperature. a clone, designated as 1-d <dig>  which displayed higher thermo-stability than wt enzyme, was selected from over  <dig> clones. sequencing of gene revealed that 1-d <dig> showed three alterations in amino acid residues .

expression and purification
the protein wt and mutant fused with gst tag  were efficiently induced and overexpressed as a soluble, catalytically active form in host strain at 15 °c. the purified wt and mutant  were detected by sds-page as a single band, which was consistent with the value predicted from the deduced amino-acid sequence .fig.  <dig> sds-page analysis of purified ests protein. m: protein molecular weight marker; 1: uninduced cell lysate of e. coli bl <dig>  harboring pgex-6p-1; 2: iptg-induced of cell lysate of e. coli bl <dig>  harboring pgex-6p-1; 3: uninduced cell lysate of e. coli bl <dig>  harboring pgex-6p-ests; 4: iptg-induced of cell lysate of e. coli bl <dig>  harboring pgex-6p-ests; 5: purified ests. the protein gst-ests is indicated by arrow



substrate specificities
the substrate specificity of wt was determined against various aliphatic acyl-chain p-np esters . ests showed the maximum hydrolytic activity towards p-np acetate , but no activity toward p-np palmitate . the results indicated that purified protein was an esterase rather than a lipase due to its preference for short acyl-chain p-np esters.fig.  <dig> substrate specificity of the purified ests. the esterase activity of ests was tested with various chain lengths of p-np esters  in 50 mm tris – hcl, ph  <dig> , at 30 °c. the activity against p-np acetate  was taken as 100 %. all measurements were performed in triplicate



biochemical characterization of wt and mutant
the optimum activity of wt and mutant was measured over a temperature range of 0–80 °c and a ph range of 5– <dig> wt showed the maximum activity around 10 °c and retained nearly 92 % activity at 0 °c. the properties of higher hydrolytic activity at a low temperature indicated that ests was a cold-active enzyme. however, no change in optimum temperature of mutant esterase was observed when compared with wt . thermo-stability analysis showed that t1/ <dig> of wt esterase was about 50 min at 50 °c with  <dig>  % of its original activity after 1 h incubation. also, complete loss of wt activity was reported after 20 min incubation at 55 °c . in contrast, the mutant enzyme showed enhanced t1/ <dig> of 70 min at 50 °c and retained  <dig>  % of its initial activity after incubation at 50 °c for 60 min, which were about 22 % higher than wt. the ph activity profile of wt and mutant was examined over the ph range of 5– <dig> under optimized assay conditions . the optimal ph of wt and mutant esterase was found to be  <dig> . wt was stable over a wide ph range of  <dig> – <dig> , but almost inactive at ph  <dig> when compared with 1-d <dig> .fig.  <dig> effect of temperature and ph on enzyme activity and stability of wt and mutant. a the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. the temperature-activity profile was measured at a temperature range of  <dig> to 80 °c in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer . activity value obtained at 10 °c was defined as 100 %. b temperature stability. the wt and mutant enzyme was incubated at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 55 °c  for various time intervals and the residual activity was measured. the specific activity without incubation was taken as 100 %. c the effect of ph on enzyme activity. the ph-activity profile was determined in phosphate–citrate buffer  and 50 mm tris–hcl buffer  at 10 °c. the activity at ph  <dig>  was defined as 100 %. d ph stability. the activity was determined by pre-incubating enzyme solutions in different phs buffers at 4 °c for 24 h and the residual activity was measured under standard condition. the residual activity after treatment with ph  <dig>  buffer was shown as 100 %

the effect of nacl on the ests enzyme activity and stability was further investigated. ests was not significantly affected and remained robust even at a concentration of 4 m nacl . ests was nacl- tolerant and retained more than 80 % of its original activity after 24 h incubation at 4 °c in the solution of high salinity  as depicted in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> effects of nacl on activity and stability of ests. the enzyme activity  was assayed in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer  containing 0–4 m nacl and the residual activity  of ests was measured after incubating with 0–4 m nacl  at 4 °c for 24 h

discussion
in this study, we have identified and characterized an esterase  from a marine bacterium serratia sp. ests preferred short-chain p-nitrophenyl esters as substrate and unable to hydrolyze long-chain p-nitrophenyl esters . the specificity towards short chain acyl esters indicated that purified protein  was an esterase. ests demonstrated the t1/ <dig> of approximately 50 min at 50 °c and retained  <dig>  % activity after 1 h incubation. in addition, the activity of ests wt was increased by low concentration  of mg2+ and mn2+, partly inhibited by cu2+ and zn2+, and completely inhibited by the addition of acetonitrile, n-butanol and sds. ests retain its activity and stability between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  after 24 h at 4 °c. furthermore, we also report the engineering of ests by directed evolution. a thermo-stable mutant 1-d <dig> was selected from the random mutant library constructed by error-prone pcr. 1-d <dig> showed change in three amino acids . no change in optimum temperature and ph of 1-d <dig> was observed in comparison to ests. but the t1/ <dig> at 50 °c of 1-d <dig> was about 70 min and it retained  <dig>  % of activity at 50 °c for 1 h, which were about 22 % higher than wt.

interestingly, ests displayed a significant adaptation towards low temperature showing the optimal activity at 10 °c and retained 92 % residual activity at 0 °c . however, ests was considerably unstable at temperatures above 55 °c. these unique characteristics indicate that ests is a cold-active enzyme . the value of optimal temperature is certainly lower than other reported cold-active esterases⁄lipases, such as: estb from alcanivorax dieselolei b- <dig> which showed optimal activity at 20 °c and retained 95 % of its original activity at 0 °c  <cit> ; est <dig> from p. pacificensis displayed optimal activity at 25 °c and retained 55 % of its original activity at 0 °c  <cit> ; rest <dig> from deep-sea sediment had shown optimal activity at 35 °c and about 12 % relative activity at  <dig>  °c  <cit> ; lipase hilip <dig> from uncultured microorganism with the optimal activity at 35 °c and 44 % activity at 10 °c  <cit> . however, the ests is slightly more stable at high temperature than all these cold-active lipolytic enzymes, which were rapidly inactivated at 55 °c.

the adaptation of cold-active enzyme to low temperatures can be attributed to the conformational flexibility conferred by some structural features: more gly residues ; less pro and arg residues; more ser and met . comparatively, ests has higher percentage of small amino acids ala  and gly  than its thermophilic counterpart est <dig>  from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and peste  from pyrobaculum calidifontis  <cit> . besides, ests has less pro  than est <dig> and more met  than est <dig>  and peste , all this is a factor probably contributing to its adaptation to low temperatures.

additionally, another noteworthy property of ests was its strong tolerance to nacl. ests was active from  <dig> to 4 m nacl and retained nearly 94 % activity even at a salt concentration of 4 m nacl . unlike most halophlic enzymes which are inactive or unstable under low salt concentrations, ests was active even without nacl  <cit> . this unique characteristic indicated ests was halo-tolerant rather than halophilic. furthermore, the presence of nacl was unable to improve the activity of ests as compared with other halo-tolerant and/or halophilic lipolytic enzymes, such as: the esterase estpc from psychrobacter cryohalolentis k <dig>  which showed 179 % activity at  <dig>  m nacl  <cit> ; and esterase pe <dig> from pelagibacterium halotolerans b <dig>  which exhibited the maximum activity in the presence of 3 m nacl  <cit> . generally, halophilic proteins have a large number of acidic amino acids on the surface, whose negative charge acts to form protective hydrated ion network that keeps the protein stable in high salt concentrations  <cit> . in the present study, ests has a higher percentage of acidic amino acid  than the basic amino acid . ests showed high negative charges on the surface, which is consistent with the distribution of the electrostatic potential of its model , which clearly indicated that the halo-tolerance of ests was depends upon structure and amino acid composition. the overall results from this study, suggests that ests is a novel cold active and halo-tolerant esterase and it may prove useful for immense biotechnological applications.

the major factors responsible for thermostability of proteins includes ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds  <cit> . in this work, a mutant 1-d <dig> was more thermo-stable than wt and showed three amino acid changes . it was predicted that ala <dig> of ests is located in the loop near first β sheet  of enzyme and does not directly with the active center. the arg <dig> of ests, which replaced by trp in 1-d <dig>  is located in the loop between fourth β sheet  and second α helix  and the asp <dig> of ests is located in the loop near fifth β sheet  and the catalytic residue ser <dig> is on the other side of β <dig>  both position  <dig> and  <dig> are on the protein surface. the mutation r116w changed the polar amino acid residue to hydrophobic residues while the mutations a43v and d147n tend to increase the hydrophobicity of ests  <cit> . this increase in the hydrophobicity lead to higher thermo-stability of 1-d <dig> than wt.

cd results demonstrated that the mutation of ests did not affect the secondary structure of enzyme but improve the activity and stability.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel cold-active and salt-tolerant esterase was purified and characterized from marine bacterium serratia sp. ests showed remarkable catalytic activity at low temperature, extreme salt tolerance and good ph stability. all the characteristics collectively make it a potential candidate for industrial applications. furthermore, a more thermo-stable esterase was obtained by error-prone pcr, and the experimental results may provide useful information for further study.
