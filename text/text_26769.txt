BACKGROUND
thymoma is a thymic epithelial cell tumor having organotypic features and no overt cytologic atypia. although controversy still remains, the classical histological classifications of thymoma based on the proportion of reactive lymphocytes and tumor epithelial cells have been replaced by a histogenetic classification that basically subdivides thymoma into medullary, cortical, and mixed types, according to cytological features of epithelial cells  <cit> . several studies supported the validity of the histogenetic classification and the world health organization  classification adopted five subtypes of thymoma stratified in histogenetic classification  <cit> . the histological subtypes in the who classification have been reported to have independent prognostic significance, and types a and ab demonstrate indolent biological behavior compared with type b  <cit> . several studies have tried to demonstrate the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms to explain the different biological behaviors of thymoma, according to the histological subtype and stages by applying several markers, but no conclusive results have been demonstrated yet  <cit> .

a recent report on genetic alterations of thymoma using comparative genomic hybridization  and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods demonstrated that type b <dig> thymoma frequently occurred with losses of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> q,  <dig> q and gains of chromosome  <dig> q, while type a thymoma rarely showed cytogenetic abnormalities  <cit> . subsequent studies by the same group based on loss of heterozygosity  analyses inferred two different genetic pathways of tumorigenesis of thymoma, and heterogeneous genetic alterations in subtypes of thymoma, excluding type a, were identified by cgh and loh analyses  <cit> . however, a recent cgh study identified several new chromosomal imbalances even in a significant proportion of type a thymomas  <cit> .

the application of dna microarray technology has provided us a high-throughput evaluation of the whole genome as well as significant genetic information at a single gene level and has enabled us to classify different neoplasms based on the characteristic genetic patterns. so far there has been no report focusing on differences of genetic alterations between subtypes of thymoma using a cdna microarray based-cgh method . in our study, genetic alterations of all who-defined subtypes of thymoma were investigated using high resolution microarray-cgh followed by hierarchical cluster analyses of the data to identify specific patterns of genetic aberrations and genes associated with each subtype.

RESULTS
chromosome analysis of thymoma
for evaluating the pattern of genetic aberration of thymoma,  <dig>  unique genes were obtained after preprocessing, of which  <dig>  were mapped by source. commonly amplified or deleted regions were identified by averaging the log <dig> ratio values of each gene from  <dig> thymoma patients, plotted on the location of the chromosomes using the chromosome analyzer and map viewer using s-plus  . when we evaluated overall chromosome patterns based on the cut-off value of ±  <dig> , deletions in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified.

subtype specific analysis demonstrated losses of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  6q, and  <dig>  identified in type a , and losses of chromosomes 1p, 2q, 3q,  <dig>   <dig>  6q,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and a gain of chromosome 9q were identified in type b <dig> . type b <dig> demonstrated losses of chromosomes 1p, 2q, 3q,  <dig>   <dig>  6q,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , and type b <dig> revealed chromosome 2q,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  12q,  <dig>  and  <dig> losses, and chromosome 1q gain . type a therefore demonstrated the least degree of chromosomal abnormality while subtypes of type b thymoma showed overlapping pattern losses in many chromosomes. chromosome 9q gain was identified only in type b <dig> thymoma, while chromosome 1q gain was present only in type b <dig> thymoma. meanwhile, type ab showed the losses of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  6q,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, losses of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were observed in all subtypes.

overall genetic pattern analysis
to investigate the genetic differences of five subtypes of thymoma, we selected  <dig> distinctive genes at a false discovery rate  of  <dig> % by multi-class sam  . supervised hierarchical clustering of  <dig> cases of thymoma microarray-cgh data with the selected  <dig> genes demonstrated that types a and b were separately clustered . however, types b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> branches were intermingled with each other. in addition, eight samples of type ab were dispersed in various b branches, and three samples of type ab were included in type a. these results suggest that type ab has combined characteristics of types a and b, genetically . hence, type ab was excluded from further analyses to diminish error rate in understanding the genetic characteristics of thymoma subtypes. among the  <dig> selected genes,  <dig> are ests with unknown functions and six are located in the 1q region. cervical cancer oncogene- <dig>  was amplified in all subtypes except for type b <dig>  t-cell receptor gamma locus  was deleted in all subtypes except for type a .

comparison of genetic aberration patterns between subtypes of thymoma
a) comparison between type a and type b
sam was performed with types a and b in order to identify genetic alterations distinguishing tumors composed of medullary and cortical epithelium. we selected  <dig> genes at a fdr of  <dig> %, and the hierarchical clustering showed the clear separation of type a and type b . small branch pattern analyses showed more similarity between type b <dig> and type b <dig> than between type b <dig> and type b <dig>  and some similarity between type a and type b <dig>  among the  <dig> genes selected, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> included 10% each , and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each included 6% . we observed that these genes were closely located within each chromosome, suggesting the possible fragmental losses of thymoma chromosomes. for example, three genes were located nearby on 1p <dig>  and four genes were located nearby on the 5q arm. among the genes on chromosome  <dig>  flj <dig> ,  <dig> kda selenoprotein , leptin receptor gene related protein , and phosphatidylinositol glycan, class k , were frequently deleted in cortical subtypes.

b) comparison between type a and type b3
sam was performed with types a and b <dig> in order to identify genetic alterations responsible for the markedly different biologic behaviors of types a and b <dig>  seventy genes with different copy numbers were selected with a fdr of  <dig> %, and the cluster analysis using these  <dig> genes showed clear separation between type a and type b <dig> . gains of these genes were prevalent in type a while losses were prevalent in type b <dig>  twenty-five of the  <dig> genes were ests, and  <dig> genes were located on chromosome  <dig>  most of which were concentrated on the 6p <dig> -6p <dig> regions. in type b <dig>  frequent deletions were observed in chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig> , butyrophilin subfamily  <dig>  member a <dig> , and thiopurine s-methyltransferase , with a frequency of 75% ,  <dig> % , 75% , respectively. all the selected genes on chromosome  <dig> were on the 5q arm, and we observed that cervical cancer oncogene  <dig>  was more amplified in all type a cases than type b <dig> cases.

the id indicate genebank id and the symbol and the cytoband information are from their source . the incidence is the number oh cases having log <dig> ratio in the range of our criteria ±  <dig> . ests are expressed sequenced tags, clones of unknown functions. genes are listed according to order fdr values.

c) comparison of cortical subtypes
based on the previous results demonstrating that among cortical subtypes, the pattern of small branches showed more similarity between types b <dig> and b <dig> than types b <dig> and b <dig>  we divided cortical subtypes into types b1+b <dig> and b <dig> for evaluating genetic alterations. we selected  <dig> significant genes with a fdr of 11% by sam . as the fdr value of differential gene selection is relatively high, type b1+b <dig> and type b <dig> were not clustered clearly, but they showed a tendency of separation. twenty-nine of  <dig> selected genes were on chromosome  <dig>  and nine of them were ests. among the  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  were amplified in type b <dig> type, while only four  were amplified in type b1+ <dig>  the selected genes were concentrated in the 1q <dig> and 1q42-q <dig> regions.

d) comparison between type a, type b 1+ <dig>  and type b3
sam was carried out with three subgroups of types a, b1+b <dig>  b <dig>  and  <dig> significant genes were selected at  <dig> % fdr, most of which are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . when a clustering analysis was carried out with these  <dig> genes , type a was clearly separated from types b1+ <dig> and b <dig> 

the id indicate genebank id and the symbol and the cytoband information are from their source . the incidence is the number oh cases having log2ratio in the range of our criteria ±  <dig> . ests are expressed sequenced tags, clones of unknown functions. genes are listed according to order fdr values.

twelve of the selected  <dig> genes were ests, with six genes on chromosome  <dig>  four genes located on 1q, chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig> , putative dna/chromatin binding motif , protein phophatase <dig> regulator subunit 12b , and sec <dig> vesicle trafficking protein-like  <dig>  were amplified only in type b <dig> 

e) prediction analysis of thymoma subtypes
based on the previous results, thymoma could be divided into three genetically distinct subgroups  and genetically heterogeneous type ab. prediction analysis of microarray   as in the method was carried out to predict to which subgroup type ab belongs. to equilibrate each group, the training set evenly included six cases from types a, b1+ <dig>  and b <dig>  eleven cases of type ab were used as a test set in the prediction analysis. the cross-validation of the selected  <dig> subgroup classifier genes showed 100% accuracy with types a and b1+b <dig> and 50% accuracy with type b <dig> in the training set . the prediction analysis demonstrated that among the  <dig> cases of type ab, three cases were classified into type a, and the remaining eight cases into type b  , which is coherent with the dendrogram in figure  <dig> 

discussion
a number of study results on systemic genetic analyses of thymoma have been reported in the past few years after a few case reports on the chromosomal abnormalities of thymoma  <cit> ,  <cit> . zettl et al. demonstrated for the first time recurrent chromosomal imbalances in type b <dig> thymoma with cgh and fish methods  <cit> . they identified  <dig> cases of type b <dig> that showed chromosomal gains  and losses , while  <dig> cases of type a did not reveal any chromosomal abnormalities, with the exception of one case with a partial loss of 6p. subsequently, the same group, using cgh and microsatellite analyses, inferred two pathways of thymoma tumorigenesis by demonstrating that type a  presented with consistent loh in the region 6p <dig> - <dig>  only, while type b <dig> revealed various aberrations such as apc on chromosome 5q <dig> , rb on 13q <dig> , and p <dig> gene on 17p <dig>   loci, as well as loh in the region 6p <dig> - <dig>    <cit> . they expanded their samples to include types ab and b <dig> in addition to types a and b <dig> by using laser-assisted microdissection or short-term thymic epithelial tumor cell cultures and found that 1) the various who-defined subtypes of thymoma exhibited different profiles of genetic alterations, 2) only type a was genetically homogeneous with abnormalities mainly involving chromosome  <dig> while other subtypes showed genetic heterogeneity, and 3) some cases of type b <dig> were genetically closely related to type b <dig>  and might arise from this type by gain of genetic aberrations  <cit> . in addition, penzel et al  <cit>  reported a main cluster characterized by a gain of 1q and losses of 6q and 16q occurring only in type b <dig> . three of eight cases of type a thymoma demonstrated various types of chromosomal imbalances in contrast to the study results reported by zetti et al  <cit> . namely, the results of the cgh studies on thymoma by two groups demonstrated some discrepancies  <cit> .

we used cdna microarray based-cgh to investigate the genome-wide genetic aberrations of thymoma. in contrast to cgh and loh analyses, cdna microarray based-cgh could provide us a high-throughput evaluation of the whole genome and also with significant genetic information at a single gene level. the other advantages of using microarray-cgh are the utility of paraffin embedded tissue dna, the requirement of a small amount of genomic dna and the possible direct comparison with rna expression. with this technique there was no need to amplify the dna in order to obtain the genetic information of more than  <dig>  genes, which sometimes may blur the results. compared to rna expression analysis, for which we need the fresh, well-stored tissue samples , using the paraffin embedded tissues allowed us to do the retrospective studies using a large number of samples.

the main purpose of our study was to identify differential genetic patterns to explain distinct morphologic findings and different biologic behaviors, according to subtypes of thymoma. for this, we included all who-defined subtypes of thymoma for genetic analysis, as in the previous reports  <cit> . the previous studies using cgh and microsatellite analyses excluded subtypes with large numbers of lymphocytes  from the samples because cgh analyses generally require a tumor cell content of more than 50%  <cit> . as we consider the clinicopathological behavior of thymoma comes from the complex biology with thymic spindle epithelial cells and surrounding microenvironment including lymphocytes. hence, to understand the phenotypic biology of thymoma, whole tissues were used for genetic evaluation in this study. the results from the current data might support in-depth understanding of tumor biology with more clinically relevant information, resulting in potential clinically useful biomarker candidates for subtype classification. however, the careful explanation is needed for understanding pathogenesis of thymoma concerning the influence from the lymphocytes.

the camvs, which was developed in our institute for the effective analysis and visualization of microarray-cgh results, was used to identify the significant genetic aberrations of thymoma. chromosomal deletions in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were observed by the comparison of the mean log <dig> ratio after microarray-cgh of a total of  <dig> cases, suggesting the characteristic genetic aberrations of thymoma. the chromosome  <dig> loci, known to possess many tumor suppressor genes, well-established deletion sites in thymoma such as 6q <dig>  6q <dig>  and 6q25- <dig>  and the genes selected in our study, were also frequently located on 6q, confirming the previous data  <cit> .

subtype specific analyses demonstrated that losses of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified in all subtypes of thymoma. type a thymoma had the least number of chromosomal abnormalities while type b had many more chromosomal abnormalities in accordance with the previously reported data  <cit> . thymoma type b revealed increased genetic aberrations suggesting a rupture in chromosomal stability, and these findings correlate well with the indolent biological behavior of type a and the aggressive behavior of type b. although a loss of chromosome 6q had been reported as the only chromosomal abnormality in a rare case of type a thymoma, a recent report by penzel et al  <cit>  identified various types of chromosome gains such as 1q, 9q,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and losses such as 2q, 4q, 5q, 6q, 9p, and 13q in three out of eight cases of type a analyzed. we also identified losses of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  6q, and  <dig> in type a. so the results of our study support the genetic heterogeneity in a significant proportion of type a, although genetic aberrations were usually less prominent, as compared with type b.

furthermore, type b demonstrated heterogeneous and overlapping chromosomal aberrations in our study. losses of chromosomes 1p, 2q, 3q,  <dig>   <dig>  6q,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and a gain of chromosome 9q were identified in type b <dig>  type b <dig> demonstrated losses of chromosomes 1p, 2q, 3q,  <dig>   <dig>  6q,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and type b <dig> revealed chromosome 2q,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  12q,  <dig>   <dig> losses and chromosome 1q gain. we could confirm the type b <dig> specific 1q gain and losses of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in all three cortical subtypes, as in previous reports  <cit> . however, losses of chromosomes 2q,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also identified in all three cortical subtypes. so our results also confirm the presence of various other overlapping chromosomal abnormalities in three cortical subtypes in addition to well established b <dig> specific 1q gain and chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> losses. furthermore, we identified chromosomal abnormalities of type b <dig> for the first time. type b <dig> shared a similar pattern of chromosome losses with b <dig> but showed a 9q gain, which was identified only in type b <dig>  these diverse genetic variations in our data support the underlying genetic influence on the biology of thymoma subtypes, resulting in various clinical behaviors.

after the systematic insight into genetic aberrations of thymoma was achieved according to molecular characteristics, the types were dissected into genetically related subgroups for further detailed analyses. first, we identified that type ab is genetically heterogeneous, so we excluded type ab for further analyses. then, we identified that type a was distinct from type b, based on the molecular characteristics.

the cortical subtypes did not demonstrate clear separation by hierarchical clustering analysis. among cortical subtypes, type b <dig> morphologically maintains distinct cortico-medullary differentiation with indistinct tumor epithelial cells and usually shows indolent biologic behavior, as compared with types b <dig> and b <dig>  type b <dig>  which definitely shows more aggressive biologic behavior than type b <dig>  has more prominent tumor epithelial cells than type b <dig> and gray zones are sometimes present between type b <dig> and b <dig> histologically. furthermore, tumors having both type b <dig> and b <dig> areas are commonly present. so we expected genetic similarities between type b <dig> and type b <dig>  however the pattern of small branches showed more similarities between types b <dig> and b <dig> than between types b <dig> and b <dig> 

based on the hierarchical clustering analysis, we could assume that thymoma could be divided into four genetically different subgroup of types a, ab, b1+ <dig>  and b <dig>  we tried to assign  <dig> genetically heterogeneous cases of type ab into types a and b using the prediction analysis. the prediction analysis results were coherent with the clustering analysis results, showing that three clustered in type a were predicted to be type a, and eight clustered in type b were designated as type b. type ab was reported to be genetically more heterogeneous than type a and some chromosomal aberrations characteristic of type b were reported to be present in type ab  <cit> . type ab is defined as an organotypic thymoma, showing both features of medullary and cortical thymoma. in fact, there is a wide morphologic spectrum in type ab. some show a distinct nesting of spindled epithelium as in the regard type of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, while in others, epithelial cells are sprinkled individually as in the schmincke type of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

the who classification of thymoma is reported to be associated with the invasiveness and recurrence of thymoma. among the various gene sets, the  <dig> genes distinguishing types a and b <dig> might be related to the malignancy of thymoma, because b <dig> is the typical malignant tumor with a metastatic property among  <dig> subtypes. among the  <dig> genes, the significant number of genes were related to cell structure and adhesion. nedd <dig>  and ctnnb , which are known to be the adhesion-related genes, were deleted in type b <dig>  suggesting increased cell motility for metastasis. as penzel et al. reported the genetic amplification in chromosome  <dig> in malignant type b <dig> and b <dig>  frequently amplified genes chromosome  <dig> were observed in b <dig>  <cit> .

there have been no standard methods to detect the significant genes among the distinct groups in microarray-cgh. several reports mentioned the correlation of the cgh and expression profiling suggesting the possibility of using similar approach for both in selecting the significant genes  <cit> . among the several analytic methods for gene expression profiling, sam method has been used as one of the standard methods based on the t-test. therefore, sam method is applied in this investigation. recently, a few reports suggest new methods to detect numbers of significant genes between distinct groups in microarray-cgh  <cit> . as there is no valid method to analyze differentially gained or lost genes in microarrya-cgh, more appropriate method with biological validation should be evaluated.

only one concern of this study is the limited numbers of the samples in each type. especially with the microarray-cgh, which could evaluate thousands of genes simultaneously, the sample size is the significant matter. to overcome the over-fitting problem, one effort is to divide the samples into the training and the independent test set. however, the sample size is not large enough to select the genes based on this approach, requiring us to apply the cross-validation method in the same training set. as all these efforts to define the subgroups based on the clinicopathologic or molecular level result from the lack of good prognostic markers and treatment strategies of thymoma, the capacity of prediction of current proposed genes sets needs to be validated in more samples prospectively in accordance with the clinical parameters.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we evaluated the genetic characteristics of the who-defined five subtypes of thymoma using microarray-cgh. we observed that thymoma could be divided into four genetically distinct groups of a, ab, b1+ <dig>  and b <dig>  type ab was determined to be genetically heterogeneous in morphology. we identified sets of genes which characterize the molecular subgroups for the basis of understanding thymoma biology and the candidate biomarkers of each group. in conclusion, this study provides significant information on the genetic background of thymoma for classification purposes.
