BACKGROUND
microarrays, by making use of the sequence resources created in genomic projects, are a powerful technology capable of measuring the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and have dramatically expedited comprehensive understanding of gene expression profiles for disease development. for example, microarray technology has been used to compare gene expression profiles between normal and diseased cells and this has led to dramatic advances in the understanding of cellular processes at the molecular level  <cit> . several microarray platforms are currently available. the short-oligonucleotide-based affymetrix genechip® arrays utilize multiple probes for each gene with an automated control for the experimental process from hybridization to quantification and thus provide reliable and comparable data  <cit> . the multiple probe sets for each gene are typically scattered across the surface of the affymetrix microarrays. variations in intensity from probe to probe or chip to chip for samples need to be resolved to obtain a reliable level of expression. various statistical algorithms are available for probe-cell level normalization and expression-value summary.

researchers are still confronted with challenging questions after completing the expression profiling and these include how to validate and standardize the data processing using proper statistical analysis. quantitative-real time-reverse transcription pcr  is widely used and is a sensitive and robust technique for the detection and quantification of often rare mrna targets  <cit> . q-rt-pcr has also become one of the gold standards for both pathogen detection and gene expression studies and is the method of choice for corroborating microarray data  <cit> . in this study, the q-rt-pcr system is based on the detection of the fluorescent activity and quantification of the taqman® probe, which undergoes cleavage in proportion to the amount of pcr product formed  <cit> . by recording the amount of fluorescence emission at each cycle, it is possible to monitor the pcr reaction during the exponential phase where the first significant increase occurs and the amount of pcr product correlates to the initial amount of target template.

an appropriate internal control for q-rt-pcr should be expressed stably across all data samples and if this is true, measurement of genes relative to the internal control will reflect the real gene expression. it implies that a reference gene should have a small variance and a sufficient intensity when applied as an appropriate internal control. moreover, most published studies have focused on the identification of reference genes that can be used to normalize expression of a gene across patient samples or tissue types rather than within one specific type of tissue or cell line  <cit> . generally speaking, housekeeping genes, such as actb , gapdh , and 18s ribosomal rna, are commonly employed in q-rt-pcr analysis  <cit> . however, several studies have also demonstrated that the gene expression patterns of many commonly used internal controls may vary as a result of tissue type, experimental conditions or pathological state  <cit> . the "perfect" control gene for all q-rt-pcr does not exist because variability in q-rt-pcr data can also stem from differences in the expression of the reference gene, for example gapdh and atcb, on which the expression of all the other genes is based  <cit> . although 18s ribosomal rna has been shown to be a reliable control in many studies  <cit> , it does not undergo reverse transcription when using oligo  primers and is inappropriate for use when such primers are used. szabo et al. developed statistical models to assist in identifying appropriate housekeeping genes as q-rt-pcr normalization controls in one or multiple types of tissue samples  <cit> . however, their rigorous approach heavily relies on an assumption that there is a multivariate normal distribution for the microarray expression levels and may not fit a practical situation, especially without a large number of arrays. in addition, their models are only applicable to the analysis of random samples, not paired samples collected from each patient as in this study.

we aimed to address two unanswered questions associated with microarray target selections for q-rt-pcr validation. firstly, it is not certain which gene or genes can serve as better internal controls for q-rt-pcr simply because there is no perfect internal control  <cit> . secondly, a major challenge when scoring the correlation between microarray and q-rt-pcr measurements remains unsettled because different probe level normalization methods may result in different correlations. in this study, we propose a statistical re-sampling method to display the variation pattern or to calculate the inter-quartile range  and the variance of gene expression levels that are associated with different probe level normalization methods. we utilized the block bootstrap re-sampling technique to circumvent the within-block dependence of affymetrix microarray data when using paired adjacent normal and tumor samples from lung adenocarcinoma patients. moreover, we employed box plot results for lung adenocarcinoma gene expression and identified ddx <dig> as a novel internal control for q-rt-pcr. ddx <dig> is a highly conserved member of the dead box family and is known to be a rna helicase that is involved in both pre-mrna and pre-rrna processing  <cit> . twenty-three genes, which were differentially expressed between adjacent normal and tumor samples, were further selected for q-rt-pcr analysis and were examined by microarray analysis with several probe level quantile normalization methods using either ddx <dig> or gapdh as internal controls. no matter which probe level quantile normalization was used for comparison, ddx <dig> was a better internal control than gapdh for lung cancer datasets.

RESULTS
identification of a novel internal control through variation in gene expression levels
differentially expressed genes, identified by microarray through global normalization, require validation of their expression patterns through q-rt-pcr, which generally employees one internal control for normalization. this distinct normalization method calls for a correct internal control for the microarray and q-rt-pcr data comparison. to prioritize the potential internal controls for q-rt-pcr analyses and to study the possibility of general utilization of these potential internal controls, we first applied the block bootstrapping technique to rank genes with variance and iqr . this method was then used to evaluate the gene expression patterns of the various internal controls in a lung adenocarcinoma microarray dataset  with the goal to provide insights into which internal controls might be a best choice in this study. for illustration, we first used the rma for probe-cell level normalization and expression-value summary of the  <dig> microarrays in the nhri dataset. associated with each gene, the appropriate averages of  <dig>  bootstrap replicates for the  <dig> computed statistics produced a box plot that disclosed variation in gene expression. as a result, many potential internal controls were revealed. to prioritize the targets, we removed those with lower intensity signals and the multiple probe sets on affymetrix chip with potential cross hybridization contamination between genes as determined by netaffx™ analysis center  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> candidate internal controls, which exhibited small variance expression, were identified using the box plots and these were ddx <dig>  pkm <dig>  bhlhb <dig>  glo <dig>  laptm4a, set, kiaa <dig>  cltc, msn, abcf <dig>  ephb <dig>  ccl <dig>  ptpn <dig> and ddr <dig> . in addition, the box plots for  <dig> well-known internal controls  <cit>   are also shown in figure 2a. surprisingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> probe sets have various levels of cross hybridization as identified by the netaffx™ analysis center . the unique characteristics of these well-known internal controls for q-rt-pcr are their high expression levels and there are also huge variances.

the copy number of the individual housekeeping gene chosen for relative quantification should be in a similar range to that of the target gene to make comparative quantification possible  <cit> . further analysis indicates that we can identify a series of internal control candidates, which have characteristics of small variance in different microarray intensity intervals . these potential internal controls are presented in different intensity ranges in order to appropriately normalize different target genes. despite the fact that these potential internal controls may exhibit a greater variance than ddx <dig> or other internal controls listed in figure 2a, these potential internal controls have much smaller variance than actb and gapdh . this finding further supports a view that the intensities of normalized microarray data and the copy numbers of q-rt-pcr detections in gene expression patterns could be examined in a similar range. our approach may provide a method to identify potential internal controls to be in a similar range of expression as the selected target genes.

to prioritize the potential internal control for the lung cancer microarray data, two major public accessible lung cancer microarray datasets, which also used affymetrix chips, namely the boston and the ann arbor datasets  <cit> , were included for data comparison. eleven candidates, after the exclusion of abcf <dig>  bhlhb <dig> and laptm4a, were available in both boston and ann arbor datasets and were included in the analysis. figure 2b and 2c show the results of basic bootstrapping using these two datasets of unpaired design. all  <dig> candidates exhibited less variation than most well known internal controls, suggesting that all  <dig> candidates have potential to serve as an internal control, at least for lung cancer. to finalize the target for further empirical validation, these potential controls were sorted in the order of increasing gene expression intensities and decreasing iqr, respectively. as a result, cltc, ddx <dig> and msn were found to exhibit sufficient intensity. however, ddx <dig> gave the smallest variation among the three. therefore, in this study, we chose ddx <dig> for further characterization.

considering this study was a paired design with a moderate sample size, we applied the block bootstrapping technique and evaluated the gene expression patterns of various internal controls using the nhri dataset . a total of  <dig> blocks, resulting from  <dig> pairs of adjacent normal and tumor samples and  <dig> un-paired samples of microarrays, were used in the block bootstrap. the re-sampling process was repeated  <dig>  times to obtained  <dig>  bootstrap replicates of the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum for the expression level of each gene. the bootstrap replicates for all five statistics for ddx <dig> expression are roughly constants, but those for gapdh expression vary greatly .

ddx <dig> exhibited relatively similar expression patterns between adjacent normal and tumor samples as well as across various lung cancer cell lines when compared to gapdh . in addition to rma, we also employed the other two different methods, mas <dig> and gc-rma, for the probe normalization to analyze  <dig> affymetrix microarray chips using lung adenocarcinoma rna samples. the three different normalization methods displayed consistent expression patterns for ddx <dig>  suggesting that ddx <dig> may serve as a reliable internal control  <cit> .

q-rt-pcr validation and comparison with microarray
we employed affymetrix hg-u133a chips to elucidate the gene expression profiles for  <dig> pairwise primary lung adenocarcinomas. in total,  <dig> out of  <dig> differential expression transcripts between adjacent normal and tumor parts were clustered by the wilcoxon signed-rank test with p-value  adjusted for multiple genes in terms of the false discovery rate  <cit> . by examining  <dig> paired lung adenocarcinoma samples with q-rt-pcr, the results from  <dig> genes were subject to statistical analysis. two internal controls, ddx <dig> and gapdh, were used to obtain the relative expression patterns and the results compared. the correlation between microarray with rma normalization and q-rt-pcr were analyzed by pearson's and kendall's τ correlations and the summary is shown in table  <dig>  based on pearson's correlation coefficient, the percentage of genes with significant correlations between the microarray and q-rt-pcr expression was 70%  using ddx <dig> normalization, which is much higher than the 48%  for gapdh. if we only focus on the significant q-rt-pcr expressions  based on tumor vs. adjacent normal, the percentage of genes with similar patterns between microarray and q-rt-pcr expression was 91% . similar results were also observed using kendall's τ correlation coefficient . to address whether a good internal control for q-rt-pcr was able to reflect the gene expression pattern in microarray, differentially expressed genes identified by the wilcoxon signed-rank test with p values ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> were compared with the q-rt-pcr results. again, a percentage around 80% of significant correlation was found when ddx <dig> was used as an internal control.

the expression pattern comparisons of ddx <dig> in other microarray datasets
to explore the possibility that ddx <dig> can be generally utilized as an internal control, we further analyzed ddx <dig> expression patterns using a new affymetrix based nci <dig> dataset  <cit>  from genomics institute of the novartis research foundation . the expression patterns of ddx <dig> were investigated in  <dig> different types of cancer cell lines  and several additional cell lines with a total of  <dig> cell lines and ddx <dig> exhibited much smaller variation than gapdh for all cell types . moreover, the expression patterns of ddx <dig>  cltc and msn  were further compared with actb and gapdh in the lung cancer cell lines found in nci <dig>  all three candidates showed less variance than both well-known internal controls. similar patterns were also observed in our nhri dataset . additional cdna microarray datasets were also downloaded from stanford microarray database  <cit> , including lung cancers  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinomas   <cit>  and the hela cell cycle dataset  <cit> , which reported cell cycle related genes by synchronizing hela cells at different phases of cell cycle  <cit>  . based on these comparisons, we conclude that ddx <dig> is evidently a novel internal control with a relatively constant expression pattern in lung adenocarcinoma. in addition, using limited microarray datasets analyzed in this paper, the variation in ddx <dig> levels was also relatively small in other cancer cell lines, raising the possibility that ddx <dig> could serve as a novel internal control.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we adapted block bootstrap for using with a paired design to circumvent the within-pair dependence. this proposed re-sampling strategy together with the use of a box plot provides a useful distribution-free statistical procedure for exploratory data analysis. this systematic analysis procedure focused on identifying genes with minimal variation in their microarray data, which facilitates the essential internal control selection steps prior to q-rt-pcr analysis. finally, systematic microarray and q-rt-pcr analyses reveal that the proposed re-sampling technique of block bootstrap suits paired design experiments and adequately detects genes with minimal variation in a microarray dataset.
