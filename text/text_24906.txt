BACKGROUND
repetitive short interspersed elements  are ubiquitous eukaryotic retrotransposons. sine sequences are approximately 70– <dig> base pairs  averaging about 250 bp  <cit>  with most organized into an rna gene-derived region, a di-nucleotide repeat region and terminating in a poly a or poly a/t tail  <cit> . sines are “non-autonomous” such that amplification and integration is dependent on enzymes derived from the host genome and long interspersed nuclear elements   <cit> . proliferation is initiated via recognition of promoter boxes residing in the trna-related region of the genomic “master-copy” by host-derived rna polymerase iii and eventually results in novel retrotransposed copies  <cit> . sines constitute roughly 10% of the mammalian genome  <cit>  and classification into family or subfamily designations is based on sequence variation and presence in specific evolutionary lineages  <cit> .

initially viewed as “junk” dna without function, seminal studies in rodents  <cit>  and primates  <cit>  indicate a far more important role for sines in genome organization, gene evolution, and disease. for example, germ-line insertions are correlated with non-homologous genome rearrangements, generation of novel coding sequences, alteration of regulatory elements and are linked with the origin and evolution of highly conserved non-coding elements in mammals  <cit> . within somatic cells, de novo sine integration can disrupt pathways involved with cell differentiation  <cit> , modulate intracellular targeting of mrnas  <cit>  and potentially provide other cell-specific phenotypes  <cit> .

direct phenotypic variation is possible by altering gene expression via insertion into coding regions or interference from the internal rna polymerase promoters in sines  <cit> . analysis of the dog genome revealed sine insertion polymorphisms resulting in anti-sense transcription that provide alternate splice site junctions  <cit> . for example, alterations of fur color  <cit> , muscular disorders  <cit>  and body size diversity  <cit>  in canidae are correlated with sine insertions associated respectively with silv, ptpla and igf <dig>  in addition, sine insertion into an exon of stk38l causes retinal degeneration  <cit>  and an ancient sine locus serves as an enhancer for fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  during mammalian brain formation  <cit> .

sines are highly informative markers used in mammalian phylogenetic and population genetic studies of cetaceans  <cit> , carnivores  <cit> , primates  <cit> , rodents  <cit> , xenarthrans  <cit> , marsupials  <cit>  and the diverse assemblage of african species termed afrotheria  <cit> . with few mechanisms for precise removal, sine insertions are nearly homoplasy-free unidirectional markers and therefore informative in deciphering complex patterns of speciation  <cit> . in general, phylogenetic inferences rely upon presence and absence data of sine loci among taxa. however, instances of parallel insertions unrelated to phylogenetic associations have been detected through sequence data  <cit>  and indicate sines target specific sequence motifs during proliferation  <cit> . incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms via ongoing hybridization or introgression among populations may cause contradictory findings in sine-based phylogenetic reconstructions  <cit> . consequently, accurate species trees are required to serve as a reference phylogeny for interpreting patterns of insertion and sequence divergence at sine loci.

here we utilized the well-resolved phylogeny of felidae as a species tree to investigate the evolution a lesser known family of mammalian sines; those within the order carnivora, termed cansines. the two suborders of carnivora are caniformia  and feliformia . caniformia is organized into ursidae , canidae , otariidae , odobenidae , phocidae , mustelidae , mephitidae , procyonidae , ailuridae   <cit> . feliformia is composed of felidae , viverridae , prionodontidae , eupleridae , naniniidae , herpestidae , and hyaenidae   <cit> . initially discovered in multiple species of caniformia  <cit> , cansines were presumed absent from feliformia. this was revised upon further studies of the feline y-chromosome  <cit>  and through whole genome sequence analyses  <cit> .

we used comparative methods to sequence cansines within feliformia with specific focus on the felidae. thirty-seven cat species augmented by representatives from related feliform represent roughly  <dig> million years  of divergence   <cit> . the extant cat species diverged into eight lineages in a nearly starburst pattern over  <dig> my  <cit> , and have largely maintained synteny in chromosome architecture  <cit> . roughly 10-11% of a felid genome is comprised of sines  <cit> . we identified  <dig> new cansine loci, which were divided into quiescent and active subfamilies. in addition, we found empirical evidence of the effects of rapid speciation and imprecise sine excision on phylogenetic consistency.

RESULTS
we applied both in silico genome mining and pcr-based approaches to identify feliform cansine loci, which were then sequenced in  <dig> extant felidae species and five additional representatives from prionodontidae, viverridae, herpestidae, and hyaenidae. first, direct in silico genome annotation of the domestic cat , verified against the dog genome , identified  <dig> new cansine loci . second, a sine-to-sine pcr method  <cit>  isolated another  <dig> sine-flanked genomic regions in exotic felids . among the  <dig> total amplified regions,  <dig>  included two or more independent insertions in feliformia species. together these represent  <dig> previously uncharacterized cansine loci .

cansine insertion hotspots
cansines from different lineages targeted homologous loci during proliferation and retrotransposition within the genome. at least three inserts were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> multiple-insert loci  in felidae . for example, inserts at locus  <dig> occurred in unrelated lynx rufus, profelis caracal and pardofelis marmorata, along with a synapomorphic insertion shared in the seven species of the ocelot lineage . each of these four cansines was flanked by species-specific, overlapping target site duplication sequence . independence of the four insertion events is verified by multiple nucleotide indels in the microsatellite and poly a/t segments. furthermore, the l. rufus sine is in the reverse orientation. similarly, locus  <dig> contained six independent insertion events including: 1) a shared synapomorphy defining the bay cat lineage, 2) a shared synapomorphy of p. caracal/p. aurata and 3) autapomorphic insertions in felis nigripes, p. rubiginosus, p. bengalensis and p. planiceps. in the latter case, insertions in p. bengalensis  and p. planiceps  were unfixed .

an examination of patterns of sequence divergence of both trna and genomic flanking regions suggests the insertions at  <dig> occurred independently among species. in f. nigripes and p. bengalensis cansines were flanked by different tsds and the percent identity was  <dig> % within the sine regions compared to  <dig> % in the regions flanking the sine . similarly, p. planiceps and the bay cat lineage cansines are flanked by different, but overlapping, tsds and the percent identity was  <dig> % within sine regions compared to  <dig> % in the  <dig> nucleotides flanking the sine. while these sequence diversity estimates do not definitively preclude post insertion mutations, they are consistent with independent retrotransposition events by unique rna templates.

evolutionary assessment of feliform cansines
based on alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction of conserved trna regions, we identified major cansine lineages defined by distinct motifs, which we have designated as subfamilies and subtypes . subfamily i members share a diagnostic ‘tcctgat’ motif at position  <dig> within the 5’ trna-related region. additional variants within the trna-related region of ‘ca’ or ‘gt at position  <dig> and ‘ggga’ or aaga’ at position  <dig> were diagnostic for subtypes ia and ib respectively . loci in subfamily ii share a ‘ggctcgg’ motif at position  <dig> within the trna region and subtypes iia and iib are delineated by an insertion/deletion  at position  <dig> within the 5’ trna-related region . notably, there is an a > t polymorphism at position  <dig> within the rna polymerase b box that segregates nearly perfectly with subfamilies i and ii and a t > g polymorphism in the rna polymerase a box that is specific to subtype iib . in addition, published sine voucher sequences annotated from f. catus clustered within the two subtypes of subfamily ii .phylogenetic differences between the two subfamilies are concordant with ancestral versus recent nodes within the feliformia species tree. the most ancestral cansine lineage is subfamily i, composed of loci conserved among the  <dig> families in feliformia and thus likely arose in a common ancestor ~ <dig> mya . within subfamily ii, four of the  <dig> subtype iia cansines arose ~ <dig> mya in a common ancestor of felidae and priondontidae, in the progenitor of felidae or early in the initial felidae radiation, while the remaining six are scattered among more recent lineages . in contrast, all  <dig> of subtype iib insertions are localized to individual felid clades or are unique to a single species and thus likely arose within the last  <dig> million years .

if cansine proliferation and subsequent sequence divergence is correlated with evolutionary time, then more ancient inserts will have greater nucleotide variation then those of recent origin. the more ancestral subfamily i is three times more diverse  than subfamily ii  . the most variable cansine was subtype ia  and the least variable was subtype iib  . these results suggest that measures of average sequence divergence observed in cansine lineages, calibrated by the feliform phylogeny, are estimates of time since periods of active proliferation.

using an unpaired t-test, differences in the mean genetic distances between each subfamily and subtypes within each family were significant with p < <dig> .

cansine evolution in the cat family felidae
the phylogenetic fidelity of the  <dig> cansine loci varied among the hierarchical nodes within feliformia. the  <dig> species-specific loci were distributed among the eight major felidae lineages. an additional  <dig> cansines supported the monophyly of feliformia . another three insertions supported the monophyly of felidae and one cansine locus supported the sister group relationship between felidae and priondontidae . two unique insertions were found in non-felidae representatives of h. hyaena and c. ferox. twenty cansine loci were diagnostic for internal clades within felidae while seven of the eight major felid lineages had diagnostic loci . intra-lineage markers included loci defining clades within the panthera, asian leopard cat, caracal, ocelot and felis lineages .

discordant phylogenetic inferences correlate with polymorphic loci
the  <dig> cansine loci presented here were mapped to a phylogeny based on multiple optimality criterion described by johnson et al.   <cit> . however, alternate branch topologies and phylogenetic ambiguities are indicated by six of the  <dig> cansine loci. in the lynx lineage, an orthologous insertion at locus  <dig> was homozygous in all l. pardinus individuals while a second independently derived insertion, occurring 315 bp downstream of the first, was homozygous in l. canadensis. these orthologous insertions are polymorphic within l. lynx, with individuals either homozygous for one of the insertions or heterozygous, containing one copy of each . no correlation was observed between the geographic origin of l. lynx individuals and cansine profile . further ambiguity of the lynx genus topology was indicated by the presence of cansine locus  <dig> in all l. canadensis and l. lynx individuals with absence from l. pardinus .

likewise, cansines did not always map to expected species associations within the south american ocelot lineage. cansine locus  <dig> is fixed in leopardus pardalis, l. jacobita, l. tigrina, l. guigna and l. geoffroyi, yet absent in l. wiedii and l. colocolo . in the asian leopard cat lineage, locus  <dig> is polymorphic in p. rubiginosus and p. bengalensis, fixed in p. viverrinus and absent from p. planiceps .

to account for the possibility that the cansine profiles described above are the result of recent hybridization events between closely related species, mitochondrial profiles at the nadh <dig> gene were obtained from all individuals representing the lynx, ocelot and asian leopard cat lineages. we found most mtdna haplotypes to be consistent with species designation and the previously proposed phylogenetic relationships among the felidae species. the exception was p. rubiginosus, which had differing nadh <dig> haplotypes identical to those found among p. bengalensis .

two cansine loci that may be mapped to the “backbone” of the felidae tree were also inconsistent with prior estimations of the initial felidae radiation. locus  <dig> is present in all species of the domestic cat, asian leopard cat and lynx lineages, and absent in the puma, ocelot, caracal, bay cat and panthera lineages . locus  <dig> is present in all felidae species except those of the caracal and panthera lineages .

evidence for sine excision
cansine locus  <dig> is present in all feliform taxa with one exception. in puma concolor locus  <dig> includes an 18 bp reverse-oriented sine fragment rather than a full-length sine and mapped to 63 bp of upstream sequence . by contrast, the full-length sine locus  <dig> is fixed in the two puma lineage sister species, acinonyx jubatus and p. yagouaroundi.

discussion
genomic characterization of  <dig> novel cansines in feliformia clarifies, amends and extends existing hypotheses on sine evolution and strongly supports the phylogenetic fidelity of these retrotransposons. in using the well-supported phylogeny of the cat family, felidae, as a reference species tree, we provide empirical evidence for long speculated, but rarely observed, processes such as co-evolution of sine families with the host genome, targeted insertion during cansine proliferation, lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms among closely related species, and instances of sine excision from the genome.

cansine integration targets homologous loci
the discovery of  <dig> cansine loci includes a high frequency of multiple insertions within orthologous intergenic regions. some loci serve as apparent “hotspots” of cansine activity within the felidae. for example, cansine locus  <dig> displays four independent insertion events defined by different, yet overlapping tsds. likewise, locus  <dig> supports six independent insertions, three of which occur in a single genus, prionailurus. similar patterns of cansine integration have been observed in the caniformia suborder wherein amplification of five putative c. familiaris cansine loci revealed eight additional insertions in related species  <cit> , and amplification of  <dig> intronic segments amongst caniforms revealed  <dig> independent insertion events  <cit> . possible explanations for the likelihood of additional cansines co-occurring at orthologous loci involve signature motifs associated with the l <dig> long interspersed element  derived endonuclease  <cit> . in primates, integration of sines  is facilitated by the motif ttaaaa0-8tytnr  <cit> . a similar mechanism is hypothesized in whole genome assessments that found over 20% of c. familiaris cansine integration sites include a ttaaaa motif  <cit> . likewise, cansine integration sites within feliformia share similar at-rich motifs  indicating target site preferences  <cit> .

dynamic evolution of feliform cansine lineages
beyond the initial reporting of voucher sequences  within the domestic cat whole genome sequence  <cit> , little is known of cansine evolution in feliformia  <cit> . until now, even the most current sine resource  includes only one feliform specific voucher  <cit> . here, phylogenetic analysis of the conserved trna-like regions of the  <dig> newly described cansines reveal two distinct subfamily lineages defined by time of emergence within felidae and further differentiated into subtypes marked by specific sequence motifs and adaptive reverse transcriptase promoter sites .

subfamily i likely originated roughly 45– <dig> mya when the carnivore order first split to form two major lineages of feliformia and caniformia  <cit> . subfamily ii arose during the emergence of sister families of prionodontidae and felidae, with continuous diversification until present-day felidae. the relatively smaller mean genetic distance among subfamily ii cansines compared to subfamily i  is consistent with subfamily ii insertions being acquired more recently from either a single master copy or multiple yet similar master copies, whereas subfamily i insertions are derived from a now quiescent set of master copies and have since accumulated substitutions.

historic and ongoing patterns of cansine proliferation can be inferred by both position with the feliform phylogeny and the extent of sequence divergence among loci. the more basal subfamily i is comprised of subtypes ia and ib, which each arose in a common ancestor to feliformia . significant genetic distance estimates for subtype ia and ib  imply that each lineage may have originated from different master copies and that subtype ia may have proliferated before ib. within subfamily ii, subtype iia master copy or copies may have had an ancient origin, inserting into a common ancestor of felidae and priondontidae . however, this subtype apparently remains a source of extant species-specific insertions as indicated by species-specific presence in l. colocolo and n. neofelis . subtype iib cansines are more recent, not as genetically diverse as iia loci, and are the source of most phylogenetically informative sites in extant felidae .

while the genetic distances among each cansine subfamily provide substantial evidence for a progressive evolution of cansines from the feliform ancestor to present, the phylogenetic support scores for subfamily i, subtype iia and subtype iib remain relatively low, 50-65%. in addition, subfamily i cannot be resolved into subtypes based on consensus of  <dig> minimum evolution replicates . a possible explanation for this lack of resolution could be the existence of multiple master copies that can concurrently convey insertional mutagenesis, leading to the paraphyletic pattern observed in the cansine phylogeny. this mechanism, also known as the ‘sprout’ model, has been proposed for human alus and allows for secondary master copies to provide a minor portion of a subfamily’s members  <cit> .

in addition, cansine subfamilies have distinctive polymorphisms in the pol a and pol b rna polymerase iii binding sites that may indicate adaptive evolution. as non-autonomous transposable elements, changes in host polymerase specificity can cause sine quiescence or adaptation  <cit> . here, the a > t mutation in polymerase box b of the recent subfamily ii and the t > g transversion in polymerase box a of subfamily iib is not observed in the more ancestral subfamily i and thus could be evidence of functional adaptation driving ongoing subfamily ii proliferation . however, rna polymerase iii a and b boxes are known to contain degenerate sites  <cit>  and evidence of adaptive evolution during speciation, as opposed to accumulation of random mutations, awaits further sequence analyses of rna polymerases in felidae.

deciphering cansine proliferation against a backdrop of rapid speciation
sines are generally viewed as ideal markers of genetic divergence and phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit> . however, inconsistencies between sine-based results and other molecular data may occur and are tangible evidence of complex speciation events, revealing dynamic evolutionary histories. sines can provide an advantage over snp-based molecular phylogenetic analyses, wherein determining inconsistency due to homoplasy  versus hemiplasy  is ambiguous  <cit> . here, the felidae reference species tree as a framework for sine evolution is robust  <cit>  while the few alternate topologies  <cit> , provide an opportunity to test the accuracy cansines as cladistic markers during rapid speciation.

evolution of modern felidae is marked by a nearly star-burst pattern of speciation from a common ancestor approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . as such, cansine analyses presented here reveal limitations to correct phylogenetic interpretations even at higher-order nodes within the topology. for example, the insertion at locus  <dig> suggests that the lynx lineage  is more recently derived than the puma lineage, which is consistent with prior minimum evolution, maximum parsimony and bayesian analysis, yet inconsistent with maximum likelihood reconstructions  <cit> . similarly, the insertion at locus  <dig> suggests a more basal position of the caracal lineage within felidae rather than the bay cat lineage, while previous phylogenetic reconstructions place the bay cat lineage at a more basal position than the caracal lineage , with statistical support from 50-100% depending on the optimality criterion  <cit> . the insertion patterns at loci  <dig> and  <dig> can be attributed to the nearly simultaneous divergences of the lynx and puma lineages ~ <dig> mya and the bay cat and caracal lineages ~ <dig> mya  <cit> , resulting in “ancient” incomplete lineage sorting, a phenomenon previously observed in sine profiles of cichlid species that diverged during a similar span of time, ~5– <dig> my  <cit> .

similarly, rapid evolution has resulted in mosaic sine profiles that reflect complex intra-lineage speciation patterns. in the ocelot lineage, l. jacobita and l. colocolo diverged within  <dig>  years from the stem lineage , and l. tigrinus, l. guigna and l. geoffroyi all arose within a brief  <dig> -year interval   <cit> . in the lynx lineage,  <dig>  years separates the l. canadensis, l. lynx and l. pardinus species complex . likewise, in the asian leopard cat lineage p. bengalensis, p. viverrinus and p. planiceps diverged within a  <dig> -year interval   <cit> . in addition, documented instances of ongoing hybridization between species in the wild further complicate phylogenetic analyses and taxonomy  <cit> .

these instances of rapid speciation in felidae are correlated with incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms among cansine loci. in the lynx lineage, maximum likelihood phylogeny derived from concatenated segments of nuclear dna indicate l. lynx and l. pardinus are sister taxa  <cit> , contrary to recent bayesian reconstructions including mitochondrial dna  <cit>  that support a more basal position of l. pardinus with respect to l. lynx and l. canadensis. cansine distributions described here reflect the nearly simultaneous and successive speciation of the lynx, a process observed repeatedly amongst mammalian lineages  <cit> . in this instance, rapid divergence resulted an ancestral polymorphism at locus  <dig> becoming fixed for presence or absence in l. canadensis and l. pardinus while remaining polymorphic in l. lynx. in contrast, a fixed insertion at locus  <dig> supports a sister taxa relationship between l. canadensis and l. lynx . additional evidence, possibly from upcoming whole-genome efforts, should reveal a more comprehensive view of lynx phylogeny  <cit> .

previous analyses also failed to fully resolve the phylogenetic position of l. jacobita and l. colocolo within the ocelot lineage. depending on the molecular data types examined and the optimality criterion employed, these two species have been placed as sister taxa or as belonging to other clades within the ocelot lineage  <cit> . hence, whether the presence cansine locus  <dig> in l. jacobita is due to incomplete lineage sorting of a cansine that was present in the leopardus ancestor or due to a closer evolutionary relationship between l. jacobita and the l. tigrinus, l. geoffroyi and l. guigna clade, rather than l. colocolo, cannot be determined . intraspecific single nucleotide polymorphisms  present in the l. pardinus  <dig> locus indicate the insertion was present during the genesis of this species and not inherited more recently through hybridization .

in some instances cansines reflect ongoing and ancestral episodes of hybridization in felidae. for example an orthologous insert at locus  <dig> in p. rubiginosus, p. bengalensis, and p. viverrinus to the exclusion of p. planiceps is incongruent with prior strongly supported species associations and is in direct conflict with a fixed insertion site at chromosome c <dig> diagnostic of the p. bengalensis/p. planiceps/p. viverrinus clade  <cit>  . notably, the two heterozygous p. rubiginosus cansine sequences differ yet are each identical to cansine  <dig> copies in p. bengalensis. this in conjunction with the p. rubiginosus nadh <dig> haplotype, indicates hybridization with p. bengalensis after the initial radiation of prionailurus .

further, p. bengalensis serves as a model of an ongoing sine fixation process. p. bengalensis is divided into two putative subspecies that diverged ~ <dig>  mya: a ‘northern’ population on the asian mainland and a ‘southern’ population on the malay peninsula,  <cit> . the four individuals examined from the northern population are polymorphic at locus  <dig>  compared with four southern homozygous individuals. albeit a small sample size, the data suggest that the populations differ in cansine fixation at locus  <dig> and is perhaps linked with ongoing genetic drift.

overall, our findings suggest that rapid speciation results in mosaic genomes with conflicting phylogenetic signals  <cit> . in such instances a polytomy or split network, which recognizes shared alleles between paraphyletic groups, may be a more accurate depiction of evolutionary history. as with large scale genome sequences, cansine data did not unequivocally resolve the felidae into a series of bifurcating lineages, a pattern seen even in the reconstruction of basal mammalian lineages  <cit> .

sine locus loss
although rarely observed, perfect or near-perfect sine excision can occur via inter or intra chromosomal recombination between insertions of the same sine family or between flanking tsds  <cit> . the excision of locus  <dig> in p. concolor, marked by an inverted  <dig> bp segment, is consistent with a mechanism of non-homologous recombination. alternatively, simple repeats that surround the insertion site may have formed a loop structure that was omitted during dna replication  leading to excision. similar evidence of sine removal occurs in other vertebrate lineages, such as in the squamate darevskia subspecies  <cit>  and primates  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of whole genome sequences has dramatically increased our understanding of mammalian non-coding dnas. by employing comparative genomics methods to identify sine loci in domestic and exotic feliforms, two feliform-specific cansine subfamilies were defined based on sequence structure and taxonomic distribution. identification of a currently active sine subfamily with felidae will provide opportunities to test hypotheses about the role of cansines in somatic functional diversity. patterns of insertion also support species designations, affirming cansines as systematic markers and confirming complex evolutionary processes including incomplete lineage sorting following rapid species divergence, hybridization and sine mediated genome rearrangement.
