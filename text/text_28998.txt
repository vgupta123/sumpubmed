BACKGROUND
osteoarthritis  is a pathological change of a diarthrodial articulation characterised by the deterioration of articular cartilage, osteophytosis, bone remodelling, mineralisation in the periarticular tissues and a low grade non-purulent inflammation  <cit> . although oa is often used synonymously with the term degenerative joint disease , oa is a disease only of synovial joints whereas djd covers pathology of non-synovial joints such as spondylosis and degenerative lesions of joints which are not part of oa, such as traumatic enthesiopathies. awareness of oa and djd in the feline population has increased in recent years  <cit>  and a high radiographic prevalence of oa and djd has been observed in general cat populations  <cit> . the prevalence of oa and djd increase with age in cats  <cit> , mirroring the pattern of distribution of oa in human populations  <cit> . osteoarthritis commonly affects the elbow joint of cats  <cit> .

histological changes in the cartilage of joints with oa have been reported in many mammalian species. the development of clefts, the loss of proteoglycan, changes in cellularity and the loss of tidemark integrity of articular cartilage of oa joints are features which characterise the disease  <cit>  and which can be used to grade its severity. these features are not species specific, thus grading schemes such as the mankin histological and histochemical grading system   <cit>  have been used to record the severity of the disease in many different species. recognition of concurrent changes in other articular tissues such as synovium  <cit>  and subchondral bone   <cit>  has led to the widespread appreciation that oa is a disease which affects all the tissues in a joint.

the molecular changes characterising oa include the differential expression of matrix proteins, proteoglycans, collagens, metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in both cartilage and bone. the patterns of identified molecular changes are dependent on the species  <cit> , joint  <cit> , location within the joint  <cit>  and stage of the disease process  <cit>  although broad similarities in patterns of differential gene expression in end-stage oa are observed between species  <cit> .

the development of scb pathology in oa is believed to have a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease  <cit> . the thickness of the scb plate  <cit>  and density of trabeculae in the scb increases in naturally occurring oa  <cit> . the temporal relationship between the development of cartilage and scb pathology in naturally occurring oa is unclear, and has not been well defined in experimental models of the disease. changes in scb have been recorded at the same time point as cartilage pathology  <cit> , or they may be identified after the development of cartilage pathology  <cit> .

as the histological, and transcriptomic features of feline oa have not been correlated with gross or radiographic features, previously, the aim of this study was to report a preliminary description of the histological features and transcriptomic changes in the articular cartilage and scb of the humeral condyle in populations of cats with or without naturally occurring oa. our hypothesis was that there would be histological or molecular differences between cats with or without gross or radiographic oa change.

RESULTS
cats without elbow oa were younger  versus mean  <dig>  , p =  <dig> ), weighed significantly less  versus  <dig>  , p =  <dig> ) and had a significantly lower body condition score  than the oa group. the median radiographic score for oa and normal joints were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the median gross pathological score for the lateral and medial aspects of oa joints was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. signalment details are presented in additional file  <dig>

discussion
previous reports suggest that the feline elbow joint commonly develops oa with greater radiographic and macroscopic changes than are observed in other feline appendicular joints  <cit> . the gross pathological changes are reported to be focused on the medial aspect of the joint at the articulation of the medial coronoid process with the medial part of the humeral condyle  <cit> , which concurs with the histopathological changes found in the humeral condyle in this preliminary study. the microscopic pathological changes in articular cartilage, as assessed by the oarsi and hhgs grading schemes were limited in the population evaluated. end-stage pathologies such as a break in tidemark integrity and clefts to the calcified zone were not noted in any of the tissues evaluated. this reflects that the screened and studied population was not selected on the basis of their clinical presentation, and thus the oa tissues did not include samples from joints which had progressed to end stage disease. had the cohort consisted of older cats, reaching their natural end of life, more severe histopathological changes may have been expected. alternatively, the findings may reflect inherent difference in oa in felidae compared to other species.

the thickness of mammalian articular cartilage is broadly related to species size and weight  <cit> ; consequently it is unsurprising that feline cartilage is relatively thin. both articular cartilage thickening and a reduction in cellularity of articular cartilage have been reported in experimental feline oa  <cit> . the increase in articular cartilage thickness identified at the central part of the humeral condyle in oa joints was unexpected, as the other histomorphological changes in the oa cartilage were primarily observed in the medial aspect of the joint. however these findings were not observed when the average values of each cat were compared, and thus their significance is uncertain.

the positive correlation seen between hhgs and oarsi grades on the lateral, central and medial parts of the humeral condyle was anticipated, and consistent with a previous evaluation of these scoring systems in man  <cit> . as the oarsi score is comprised of a greater number of elements, it was used with the hope of increasing the sensitivity of detection of subtle articular cartilage lesions, compared to the hhgs alone, in light of speculation regarding the adequacy of this system  <cit> . the severity of the cartilage pathology, as measured by either grading scheme was only significantly different on the medial aspect of the joint and was not particularly marked, suggesting a relatively early stage of disease. alternatively, it may be the grading systems used were not appropriate for feline cartilage. pathology in the canine elbow joint is also almost universally observed on the medial side of the joint  <cit> , possibly as the result of abnormal loading or incongruency  <cit> . in turn this has led to the development of treatment strategies for end-stage disease which redistribute load through the healthier part of the joint  <cit> . no gross incongruency of the feline elbow was observed in the present study although incongruency was not specifically assessed, other than by gross visual and radiographic inspection post-mortem.

the osteocyte density in scb was decreased across the humeral condyle when comparing the oa joints, and in the central and lateral parts of the humeral condyle when comparing oa cats. a decrease in osteocyte density has been reported in dogs with fragmentation of the medial coronoid process   <cit> , and a decline in osteocyte density in the mcp also has negative correlations with the severity of cartilage pathology and radiographic oa score in dogs  <cit> . a reduction in osteocyte density has also been noted in femoral necks of human patients with coxofemoral oa, and is hypothesised to arise as a result of increased matrix levels of tgfβ in the oa cartilage  <cit> . however, increasing age also reduced the osteocyte density in human cancellous bone  <cit> . thus, without recourse to evaluation of age and weight matched groups we cannot definitively conclude whether the changes we identified are the result of the aging process or weight differences, which may explain their distribution across the humeral condyle, or whether they are part of, or the result of, the oa disease process.

the reduction in bone porosity  noted in the medial part of the condyle was thought to be part of the oa process, although this contradicts experimental studies which commonly reveal an increase in subchondral porosity  <cit> . whether this reflects a temporary, early-stage event  <cit> , or a species difference is unclear from this limited study.

a greater number of genes demonstrated differential expression in this study in subchondral bone compared to articular cartilage when analysed at the level of the joint, but not at the level of the individual cat. lumican expression was increased in feline elbow oa cartilage, as has been reported in canine elbow oa where its expression correlates with the radiographic severity of the disease  <cit> . lumican expression was also increased in scb. lumican is believed to have a role in the organisation of collagen fibrils of connective tissues. while knockout studies do not demonstrate a pivotal role for lum in isolation in bone or cartilage development  <cit> , it does impede the deposition of normal col <dig> fibrils in tissue engineered cartilage  <cit> . interaction between col <dig> and lum can diminish the ability of mmp <dig> to cleave col <dig>  <cit>  and so impede collagenolysis, thus the increased expression of lum observed in cartilage may be a protective mechanism to prevent the degradative process. differential expression of the remaining candidate genes profiled was not observed in feline oa cartilage, possibly reflecting the fact that these genes were selected on the basis of their previously reported expression in end- rather than early-stage oa  <cit> . comparison between these two disease states in human cartilage revealed that little differential expression of the external matrix proteins is observed in the early stage of the disease  <cit> .

since an extensive analysis was carried out on each humeral condyle, we were limited to relatively small tissue samples for each part of the study. whilst the anatomical position was consistent between different samples for the histological and molecular measures, they did not necessarily encompass the site of the worst pathology. only a single histological section was examined which may have resulted in a failure to recognise differences in adjacent tissue. at the time of data acquisition, no validated radiographic evaluation of osteoarthritis in cats was available. a modified iewg score was used, however, the validity of this score in cats is not known. joints without both gross and radiographic evidence of oa were excluded to reduce the potential for false assignment of joints. statistically significant differences in age, body weight and body condition score were found between the normal and diseased populations. the impact of these differences on the variables we assessed is unknown. however, due to the correlation between age and djd in cats, the high prevalence of oa in older cat populations means it would be very challenging to recruit meaningful numbers of geriatric cats without oa. body weight and condition score are associated with the development of oa in the canine population  <cit> , and indeed the same may be true in cats. we did not comprehensively evaluate every joint in these cats, and variations in djd-burden amongst the cats may have influenced the data. clearly our populations were highly stratified on the basis of their inclusion criteria, and thus further population studies of oa in cats are required to analyse these variables in more detail.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, histological changes in feline elbow oa appear to be concentrated on the medial part of the humeral condyle. pathology is seen in the scb, in the absence of histological pathology in the overlying articular cartilage which is similar to naturally occurring oa of other species. the changes in histological parameters and gene expression were identified in cartilage and scb, and thus future therapeutic strategies should consider both tissues in the treatment process.
