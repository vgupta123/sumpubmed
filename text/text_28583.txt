BACKGROUND
a multifunctional protein, nucleolin is ubiquitously expressed in exponentially growing eukaryotic cells. it was first described in  <dig> as a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and also in dna and rna metabolism  <cit> . more recently, nucleolin was shown to shuttle between cytoplasm and cell surface. in the cytoplasm, it provides a post-transcriptional regulation of strategic mrna, participates in rrna maturation and ribosome assembly and is involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport  <cit> . on the cell surface, it serves as a low affinity receptor for several ligands such as certain growth factors  <cit> .

following the first report of surface expression in hepatocarcinoma cells  <cit> , more data have been added for the enhanced expression of nucleolin on the surface of tumor and endothelial cells, and in endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature  <cit>  in which its expression is constantly induced  <cit> . these data, point out the involvement of cell-surface expressed nucleolin in cell proliferation in tumor cell growth but also in activated endothelial cells. the expression of nucleolin is enhanced on the surface of endothelial cells upon stimulation with the vascular endothelial growth factor , and the functional blockade or down regulation of surface nucleolin in endothelial cells inhibits the migration of endothelial cells and prevents capillary-tubule formation  <cit> .

several reports have pointed out molecules related to cell proliferation or cell differentiation as ligands for cell surface nucleolin. among these molecules are the hepatocyte growth factor, the heparin affin regulatory peptide, midkine, epithelial growth factor receptor erbb and endostatin, which all play a significant role in tumor development and angiogenesis processes  <cit> . in addition several molecules like laminin- <dig>  factor j, l- and p-selectins which regulate cell adhesion, leukocyte trafficking, inflammation and angiogenesis are also surface nucleolin binding proteins  <cit> . furthermore, urokinase which is involved in mechanisms regulating pericellular proteolysis, cell-surface adhesion and mitogenesis, binds and is co-internalized with surface nucleolin  <cit> .

in a previous study, we reported that the nucleolin binding multivalent pseudopeptide n6l suppressed both tumor growth and angiogenesis  <cit> . in vitro, n6l reduces tumor cell growth in soft agar assay in several carcinoma cell lines and the proliferation of endothelial cells. these activities in both tumor and activated endothelial cells lead to tumor growth inhibition in breast carcinoma mda-mb  <dig> xenografts in athymic nude mice without displaying any toxicity in normal tissues  <cit> . finally, n6l promotes tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo experiments  <cit> .

in this study, we have investigated the anti-angiogenic activities and the mechanism of action of n6l on human umbilical vein endothelial cells  and the role of nucleolin in these activities.

RESULTS
n6l inhibits adhesion, proliferation and migration of huvecs
the effect of n6l on the adhesion of huvecs was first investigated. as shown in figure 1a, n6l significantly inhibited the adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching a maximal effect at a concentration of  <dig> μΜ yielding 40% inhibition compared to the control . all cells will adhere if left for more than  <dig> h so we investigated the effect of n6l on the proliferation of huvecs. as shown in figure 1b, n6l inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration dependent manner, having a maximal effect at a concentration of  <dig> μΜ . the effect of n6l on huvec chemotaxis indicated that n6l inhibited chemotactic migration in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal effect  observed at the concentration of  <dig> μm . furthermore, the effect of n6l has been studied in wound-closure assays. as shown in figure 1d, n6l used at a concentration of  <dig> μm completely inhibits huvec motility.

to confirm that n6l has a direct effect on adhesion and migration and secondarily on proliferation without affecting cell survival, a cytotoxic assay using huvec, treated or not with various concentrations of n6l, has been performed. as shown in figure  <dig>  treatment of huvec with n6l for  <dig> h did not induce apoptosis. early apoptotic cells, which are in the beginning of apoptosis, are distinguished from already dead cells . the data indicated that treatment with n6l in various concentrations for  <dig> h has no effect on the survival of huvecs and confirmed that n6l has a direct effect on endothelial cells adhesion and migration and secondarily on their proliferation.

n6l down-regulates mmp- <dig> in huvec
we next studied the effect of n6l on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases  which are involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix and required for cell migration. mmps play a crucial role in angiogenesis, as they digest the ecm and facilitate the cell’s migration. mmp- <dig> is expressed in endothelial cells as well as in most of the cell types and is important for endothelial cell migration and vascular remodelling during angiogenesis  <cit> . it also facilitates the migration of tumor cells  <cit> . the results showed that mmp- <dig> activity was markedly reduced by  <dig> μm of n6l . we further demonstrated that n6l suppressed the expression of mmp- <dig> mrna determined by rt-pcr . the results indicated that both enzyme activity and expression of mmp- <dig> was inhibited by n6l.

the results suggested that n6l and therefore nucleolin might affect the expression of genes involved in proteolytic activation.

inhibition of src, fak, akt and erk1/ <dig> activation during n6l stimulation of huvecs in vitro
several studies have indicated that the src, fak, akt and mapk members are involved in the signaling cascade that regulates angiogenesis  <cit> . consequently, the effects of n6l on the phosphorylation status of these molecules in huvecs were investigated.

as shown in figure 4a, n6l promoted a decrease in src phosphorylation within  <dig> min in a concentration dependent manner with a maximal effect  at a concentration of  <dig> μΜ. similarly, we found that fak, akt and erk1/ <dig> were also inactivated after a15-min incubation with n6l in a concentration dependent manner with a maximal inhibition of more than 75% as compared to the control.

taken together, these data indicated that n6l inhibits the phosphorylation of all of these kinases in a dose-dependent manner . results showed that the anti-angiogenic action of n6l might partly occur through a suppression of src, fak, akt and erk pathways, but further research is needed in order to understand the mechanism of action of n6l and how it inhibits the activation of these signaling pathways.

down regulation of nucleolin expression inhibits adhesion and proliferation of huvecs and blocks the inhibitory action of n6l
previous reports have shown that n6l interacts specifically with cell surface nucleolin  <cit> . n6l has been reported to also bind nucleophosmin on the cell surface but with considerably lower affinity than nucleolin  <cit> .

in order to confirm that n6l exerts the previously described biological actions mainly through nucleolin, as well as the involvement of cell-surface nucleolin in these effects, we transiently transfected huvecs with a sirna targeting the mrna of nucleolin. in parallel, huvecs were transiently transfected with a sirna that does not target any mrna  .

the analysis of the expression of ncl indicates that using specific sirna targeting nucleolin mrna results in a reduction in the levels of mrna and protein up to 80% respectively .

as shown in , ncl knockdown blocked the inhibitory effect of n6l in huvecs proliferation and adhesion respectively. moreover, the same experiment shows that nucleolin is a crucial factor in the proliferation and adhesion of huvecs since the down-regulation of nucleolin expression by itself results in the inhibition of proliferation and adhesion.

down regulation of nucleolin expression inhibits src and erk1/ <dig> activation in huvecs and blocks the inhibitory action of n6l
in this study, we show that n6l inhibits phosphorylation of several kinases implicated in angiogenesis pathways in many ways.

to confirm that n6l signaling takes place mainly through nucleolin interaction, we tested the n6l effect on activation of src and erk1/ <dig> of transiently transfected huvecs with sirna for nucleolin mrna. as shown in , the phosphorylation levels of src and erk1/ <dig> are induced on transiently transfected huvecs compared with wild type cells, while nucleolin knockdown blocked n6l-induced src and erk1/ <dig> inactivation.

taken together, these results indicate that n6l/nucleolin interaction affects various signal transduction pathways that reduce the phosphorylation levels of these signal transduction molecules, and are involved in the inhibition of cellular adhesion and proliferation.

discussion
cell-surface nucleolin has been described by several studies as a molecule that is involved in the growth of tumor cells as well as in angiogenesis  <cit> . effective inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and impairment of angiogenesis have been succeeded by targeting surface nucleoproteins, like nucleolin, with n6l and hb- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, functional blockade of surface nucleoproteins seems to result in a general inhibitory mechanism that is not specific to a single pathway related to one growth factor implicated in carcinogenesis.

in previous studies, our group has shown the dual action of n6l and hb- <dig> on tumor and endothelial cells pointing out surface nucleoproteins as an important anticancer therapy target  <cit> .

n6l, which like hb- <dig>  binds nucleolin at the rgg domain of its c-terminal end, was synthesized aiming the improvement of hb- <dig> biological actions. n6l presents hexavalently the pseudo-tripeptide lysψ-pro-arg while hb- <dig> presents it pentavalently. the inhibitory action of n6l regarding hiv- <dig> entry is 4-fold compared to that of hb- <dig> and the down-regulation of surface/cytoplasmic nucleolin is greater in cells treated with n6l compared to cells treated with hb- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, n6l showed greater inhibitory action in tumor cells growth compared to hb- <dig>  <cit> . n6l, but not hb- <dig>  has been reported to also bind nucleophosmin on the cell surface but with considerably lower affinity than nucleolin  <cit> .

in this study, we sought to investigate the biological actions of n6l in huvecs. we found that n6l inhibits in vitro huvec cell adhesion, migration and motility in a concentration dependent manner . if left for more than  <dig> h, huvecs will adhere and migrate even in the presence of n6l, therefore we investigated the effect of n6l in proliferation of huvecs showing that it is also inhibited, even if it is a secondary effect . the inhibitory effect of n6l on angiogenesis  <cit> , as well as on huvecs migration and motility may be associated with down regulation of mmp- <dig>  hb- <dig>  which is similar to n6l, was shown to down regulate mmp- <dig> expression  <cit> . we found that both enzyme activity and expression of mmp- <dig> were inhibited by n6l . furthermore, we found that n6l treatment shows no toxicity in huvecs in vitro, as n6l didn’t induce apoptosis . n6l induces apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro and reduces tumor growth in mice without evidence of toxicity  <cit> . n6l and other nucants are reported to exert distinct inhibitory mechanisms depending on the malignant tumor cell type indicating that the capacity of nucant to induce cell death is by a selective mechanism  <cit> . the lack of translocation of n6l to the nucleus probably accounts for its lack of toxicity  <cit> . the mechanism through which n6l induces apoptosis in some tumor cells without affecting cell viability in other tumor cells and normal cells, like huvecs, remains to be investigated.

ligant binding to surface nucleolin could generate intracellular ca2+ membrane fluxes and initiate signal transduction events  <cit> . hb- <dig> binds the c-terminal rgg domain of cell-surface expressed nucleolin and blocks its function as a receptor or binding molecule for various ligands  <cit> . n6l also binds the c-terminal rgg domain of cell-surface expressed nucleolin and therefore it might exert its biological action in a similar way. in order to identify the signaling pathways that n6l affects and through which exerts its biological action, we investigated the effect of this peptide on well known angiogenic signaling pathways mediated by many of these ligands of nucleolin. we found that n6l inhibits the phosphorylation levels of src, fak, akt, and erk1/ <dig> in a concentration-dependent manner showing that the anti-angiogenic action of n6l might partly occur through suppressing src, fak, akt and erk pathways.

down regulating nucleolin, we found that the proliferation and adhesion of huvecs was inhibited, highlighting the importance of nucleolin in these biological actions . to confirm that our sirna was specific for ncl we examined the effect of sirna on the expression of gapdh mrna as shown in figure 5a and other molecules such as tubulin .

the inhibitory effect of n6l on cellular proliferation and adhesion was almost completely blocked in the transfected huvecs compared to the wild type . furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of src and erk1/ <dig> are induced on transiently transfected huvecs compared with wild type cells , while nucleolin knockdown blocked n6l-induced src and erk1/ <dig> inactivation . in figure 5b the reduction of hsc <dig> levels in sirna transfected cells does not indicate secondary inhibitory effects of our sirna on the expression of cellular proteins. we used hsc <dig> for western blot normalization and its reduced levels are a consequence of the reduced number of cells due to the inhibitory effect of ncl knock-down on cell proliferation. taken together, these results indicate that the complex n6l/nucleolin interaction triggers a signal transduction pathway that reduces the phosphorylation levels of these signal transduction molecules, and also that it inhibits cellular adhesion and proliferation. down regulation of mrna of ncl using sirna is reported to reduce surface nucleolin  <cit> . additionally, the expression of nucleolin on the surface of endothelial cells is due to the constant induction of nucleolin mrna, as ncl mrna and cell-surface-ncl have half-life time of about 45- <dig> min, whereas nuclear ncl has more than  <dig> h  <cit> . therefore, although we did not distinguish surface and nuclear nucleolin, we can presume with relative safety, that cell surface ncl levels were reduced in our experimental conditions. as a result, we can hypothesize the involvement of surface ncl in n6l action and consider ncl the main molecule through which n6l exerts its action, knowing that there is more research to be done in order to extrapolate that the mechanism by which n6l exerts its action is through surface ncl.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this study we shed light on the role of cell surface nucleoproteins in the regulation of their binding proteins signaling and activity in huvecs. these results indicate that n6l could constitute an interesting tool to inhibit angiogenesis. this possibility is reinforced by the fact that these multimeric pseudopeptides are synthetic molecules which are stable in serum, lack tissular toxicity and whose production can easily be up scaled, providing novel therapeutic opportunities in proliferative diseases.
