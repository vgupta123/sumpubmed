BACKGROUND
alzheimer’s disease  is the most common form of dementia affecting  <dig> million people world-wide. it is a complex disease caused by environmental and genetic risk factors. treatment is currently not available  <cit> . genetic analysis of families with rare, early onset ad implicated a few disease genes, such as app, psen <dig> and psen <dig>  <cit> . recently, additional rare variants in app, trem <dig> modulating the sporadic, late onset ad disease phenotype were discovered  <cit> . the most recent large scale dna analyses implicated, apart from the apoe locus,  <dig> loci containing common, small-effect, susceptibility variants in over  <dig> ad candidate disease genes, such as cr <dig>  clu, picalm, bin <dig>  epha <dig>  ms4a, cd <dig>  cd2ap and abca <dig> . pathobiological pathways such as insulin signalling, synaptic or mitochondrial failure, oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular effects and cholesterol metabolism have been implicated in ad  <cit> . however, the most important pathobiological hallmarks of ad are the progressive extracellular accumulation of ß amyloid peptide  in the brain and the intra-neuronal accumulation of aß and tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. extracellular overproduction of aß, insufficient aß-processing or too little aß clearance from the brain leads  to higher levels these peptides in the csf, extracellular plaques and neuronal dysfunction or death  <cit> .

studies on the involvement of the blood brain-barriers in ad disease were primarily focused on the  permeability of the endothelial bbb barrier and the potential deficient clearance of  aß peptides across it  <cit> . the endothelial  bbb is sealed by tight junction complexes made up by claudines, zonula occludens and junctional adhesion proteins, which do not exist in the “leaky” peripheral circulation. the endothelial cells of the bbb are surrounded by a basement membrane, in which pericytes reside. within the brain, the bbb capillaries are surrounded by the glia limitans, which consist of linked astrocyte end feet. all these cell types contain a variety of peptidases and cholinesterases. consequently, any  molecule, including actively transported aß, has to overcome several physical and enzymatic hurdles in order to cross the bbb from the blood to the brain parenchyma, or vice versa .

in contrast with the endothelial bbb barrier, the potential role of the blood-csf  barrier in ad has only recently drawn considerable attention. the epithelial  bcsfb barrier is located at the choroid plexus . the cps protrude as plated or lobular structures into all brain ventricles. they consist of folded monolayers of polarized neuro-epithelial cells  as an extension of the ependymal cell layer, and envelop a vascularized stroma. the cuboidal layer of cpe cells, linked together by tight junctions, forms the bcsfb barrier  <cit> . unlike the micro-vessels at the bbb barrier, capillaries in the cp stroma are fenestrated. thus, neither endothelial cells nor a local glia limitans structure form an obstacle for biomolecule transport over the bcsfb barrier. the main functions of the cpe are the production of csf, transport or production of a number of  molecules, and to act as a sink for a number of csf waste products  <cit> .

chalbot et al.  <cit>  pointed out that cpe damage may be among the first signs of ad, at least in a subset of patients. indeed, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and immunological evidence exists that the cp is involved in onset or progression of ad. the morphological and physiological changes of the cp in ad resemble those of strongly accelerated aging: ad-affected cpe cells show progressive atrophy and accumulate numerous lipofuscin vacuoles. compared to age-matched controls, the ad affected cp contains increased amounts of psammoma bodies  <cit> .

these structural changes are accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and increased cell death, which strongly affect the secretory function of the cp. silverberg  suggested that the csf pressure, primarily maintained by the cp, is first normal, than slowly rises in early stages of ad, and subsequently drops again in late stages of the disease  <cit> . in ad, not only water production into the brain, but also cpe production or transport of a range of  molecules may be compromised. these molecules include ions, vitamins, growth factors and hormones  <cit> . elegant studies on the cp in ad in in vitro and in in vivo models suggested that the cp takes up  aß <dig> and aß <dig> peptides from the csf and may clear them from the cns via lrp <dig> and other transporters  <cit> . interestingly, the cp uniquely produces and secretes transthyretin   <cit> , a tetrameric protein that binds and stabilizes soluble aß peptides in cpe cells and the csf. indeed, decreased ttr levels in the csf were previously correlated with dementia and ad  <cit> , although these findings are not unchallenged  <cit> : a recent literature review did not support cp failure in human subjects with ad or elderly with regards to production, transport or secretion of ttr, vitamin c, folate, and ions  <cit> .

the cp may also be involved in neuro-inflammation: initially, degeneration of neurons in the ad affected brain lead to a local pro-inflammatory immune cell response of activated resident glia cells. signalling by these locally activated glia cells, via the csf, may activate the cpe at the csfb barrier to recruit cpe resident or peripheral immune cells. peripheral inflammation-resolving macrophages cross, in part, the cp. interestingly, the fate of the local inflamed tissue  in the brain may thus depend on  the ability of the cp to transform parenchyma derived signals into other peripheral macrophages recruitment signals, or  the barrier properties of the cp with respect to inflammation-resolving macrophages migrating through the barrier  <cit> .

most interestingly, recent studies suggests that the cp also participates in the neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, most likely through secretion of growth factors and signaling molecules which can reach, via the csf, the sub-ventricular zone  <cit> . finally, bolos and co-workers  <cit>  very recently showed that healthy choroid plexus implants rescued ad linked pathologies in animal models. these findings highlight the importance of  choroid plexus in ad. in the current study, we investigate the human transcriptome differences between the cpe of healthy and ad-affected individuals. our data suggest that cpe damage strongly contributes to ad pathology.

methods
ethics statement
this study was performed after institutional approval of the netherlands institute for neuroscience , amsterdam, the netherlands. the human cp material was obtained from the netherlands brain bank . in accordance with the international declaration of helsinki, the nbb obtained written permission from the donors for brain autopsy and the use of brain material and clinical information for research purposes. all human data were analysed anonymously.

gene expression of healthy and affected human cpe
human cpe samples were obtained from donor brains by a team of expert neuro-pathologists of the nbb. we used freshly frozen human cpe samples from lateral ventricles of  <dig> healthy ), and  <dig> ad-affected )  <cit>  the donor age’s varied between  <dig> and  <dig> years and the post-mortem times between  <dig> and  <dig> h. apoe genotypes are available. all cpe donors were healthy  or had no history of other brain diseases than ad .

for a detailed description of our microarray studies, including  study design, sampling, staining, laser dissection microscopy, rna isolation and stringent quality control, single amplification, labelling and hybridization procedures, see our previous publications of booij et al.   <cit>  and janssen et al.   <cit> . we followed miami guidelines and submitted all our gene-expression data to the geo database submission no. gse <dig> .

in short, we used a study design with rna from human rpe/choroid as common reference, as described  <cit> . we selectively laser captured cpe cells out of  <dig> μm cryosections. cpe cells could be easily visualized using immunosytaining with anti-ttr and zo- <dig> antibodies , and histological stainings such as with cresyl-violet. after isolation and quality controls, rna was amplified once and then labeled and hybridized against human 4x44k catalogue microarrays .

the microarray image files were subsequently analysed and processed by agilent feature extraction software  and log <dig> mean intensities were assigned to the spots. next, we normalized the mean expression/intensity data of each individual sample against the common reference sample in the computer program r .

statistical analysis and functional annotation
our microarray analysis covered seven samples of healthy human cpe  and seven samples of ad-affected cpe . we used the normalized expression data of each individual sample for a statistical t-test in r  to investigate statistically significant gene expression differences between the healthy and ad-affected cpe disease state .

we selected and analysed two data-sets: genes whose expression was upregulated in ad cpe and genes downregulated in ad cpe. after the t-test, the resulting data-sets were processed, before functional annotation, as follows: final selections were made of genes  with p <  <dig> , fold change  >  <dig> . potential technical duplicates present on the array, which might otherwise skew functional interpretation, were removed. functional annotation was carried out with the knowledge database ingenuity . the core analysis of ingenuity delivers significantly enriched themes for the input dataset; in terms of biological functions, canonical pathways and molecular networks. the molecular networks are either  functional molecular networks  or structural molecular networks  proteins. for the core analysis ingenuity standard settings were used. all non-modified figures and tables derived from ingenuity are subject to copyright owned by qiagen inc.

immuno-histochemistry
immuno-histochemistry was done on  <dig> μm thick cryo-sections of cp from healthy donors and from donors diagnosed with ad . cryostate sections were fixed for  <dig> min in  <dig> % paraformaldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer. for staining we employed standard procedures. cldn <dig> was detected with cy <dig> coupled secondary antibodies after labeling with anti-claudin  <dig> antibody ab <dig> . double staining for transthyretin  and the tight junction protein  <dig>  was done using the anti-ttr/transthyretin antibody  ihc-plus™ ls-b <dig>  from lsbio, visualized with a cy <dig> coupled secondary antibody , and the zo- <dig> antibody , visualized with alexa  <dig> coupled secondary antibody . slides were photographed on a leica sp <dig> confocal microscope.

cpe molecular functional networks; ad disease labels from the literature
finally, we also compared our molecular functional networks of the cpe with  ad genes/proteins derived from the scientific literature. we compiled these ad literature lists  by hand, via pubmed, or we used the “functions and disease” entry of ingenuity. we labelled our data driven cpe molecular networks  with entries from these lists. the most obvious cp disease label in this context is, of course, ad, but we independently compiled also gene lists for multiple sclerosis  and parkinson disease .

previous literature studies also suggested that cpe function can be influenced or measured by aß  <cit> , aß removal ; apo-j, gelsolin, cystatin c, ptgds, igf1- <dig>  aat, megalin)  <cit> , oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> , mitochondrial respiratory chain defects   <cit> , aß transport , ascorbic acid  and folate transport from the blood   <cit> , csf ion   <cit>  and ph homeostasis , secretion of growth factors, csf production, as well as the immune function of the cpe during degenerative disease .

RESULTS

in total, we found  <dig> upregulated genes in  ad-affected cpe . the most highly upregulated individual genes were: lsmem <dig>  etnppl, hsapa1a/b and  <dig>  celsr <dig>  rcc <dig>  dnajb <dig>  serpinc <dig>  zbtb <dig> and zfand2a . we constructed a data driven heatmap of the  <dig> upregulated genes, which shows the correlation of gene expression among the samples used. indeed, the heatmap reveals two clusters of cpe control and ad-affected cpe samples . ingenuity core analysis of the  <dig> upregulated genes assigned overrepresented biological pathways, canonical pathways, and functional molecular networks to our dataset.table  <dig> the top  <dig> most down- , and the top  <dig> most up- regulated  genes in ad affected cpe versus healthy cpe

names of the genes are abbreviated according to genbank. for potential relationship with ad according to the scientific literature, see description in the main text

biological pathways
several biological pathways were identified in ad  cpe, but not in healthy cpe. some of these pathways also occur in cardiovascular, neurological, inflammatory, hematological and connective tissue disorders. functions assigned on a molecular and cellular level “more prominently present in  cpe than in  cpe” included: cellular compromise, cellular function and maintenance, post-translational modifications, protein folding as well as cell death and survival. more prominent physiological functions assigned to our upregulated gene expression dataset were: endocrine system development, embryological development, tissue morphology, hematological system development and function as well as increased immune cell trafficking .fig.  <dig> graph of the most significant over-represented and upregulated biological pathways in  ad cpe. the height of the bars indicates the level of statistical significance. the straight horizontal yellow line represents the cut off value of statistical significance. the yellow line jumping up and down indicates the ratio of the number of genes present in the experimental dataset, divided by the theoretical number of genes that together would make up the functionality



canonical pathways
the most important canonical pathways suggested that cellular stress in ad  cpe is increased. the most important functional annotations assigned to the upregulated pathways in our dataset were: the unfolded protein response , the endoplasmatic reticulum stress pathway, aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells, enos signalling and ran signalling .fig.  <dig> upregulation of the over-represented unfolded protein response in ad affected cpe. in the schematic drawing all regulated potential molecular players of the unfolded protein response are presented. the filled  symbols represent the entries which are actually statistically significantly upregulated in ad affected cpe  in our data set. other entries may also be expressed by the cpe, but are not regulated between healthy and ad-affected cpe



functional molecular networks
ingenuity analysis yielded  <dig> functional molecular networks. only the most relevant networks are presented , which also yielded literature labels related to ad. functional annotation of the networks largely overlaps with those of the canonical pathways.

gene expression downregulated in ad-affected cpe
we performed a t-test between our healthy human cpe  and ad  cpe gene expression data-sets . we found  <dig> statistically significant entries downregulated in ad affected cpe . we constructed a data driven heatmap of these  <dig> downregulated genes, which shows the correlation of gene expression between the samples used. indeed, the heatmap revealed two clusters of cp control and ad affected samples . the top ten most downregulated genes in  cpe vs  cpe were: brca <dig>  fabp <dig>  rps4y <dig>  prnd, c10orf <dig>  rbm <dig>  shisa <dig>  slc34a <dig>  rgs <dig>  prdm <dig> . functional annotation of the  <dig> genes revealed statistically significantly overrepresented biological functions, canonical pathways and functional molecular networks.fig.  <dig> cluster analysis of mean expression values for the down-regulated genes in ad  choroid plexus compared to healthy control choroid plexus . cluster analysis was performed using gene-e  with “one minus pearson correlation” and “average linkage method” http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gene-e/. on the y-axis the gene symbols are shown, on the x-axis the individual samples. blue and red colors indicate, respectively relatively low and high numerical expression values. the dendograms at the top and the left side denote the  relationships between, respectively, the samples and the genes. analysis parameter values are given below the figure. both the ad and control samples cluster nicely together. to view details, please use your pdf zoom function.



biological pathways: down in ad  affected cpe
the most prominent overrepresented gene expression features in our dataset pointed toward  basic cellular functions and disease. in terms of disease, ingenuity recognized similar patterns/molecular mechanisms underlying both hereditary and developmental disorders as well as underlying ophthalmic and neurological disorders. the most important downregulated molecular and cellular functions were: cellular development, growth and proliferation, carbohydrate metabolism, dug metabolism and molecular transport. most significantly, major changes in  cpe, compared to  cpe, were found in terms of embryonic/neural development and function as well as tissue development and morphology.

canonical pathways: down in  cpe
functional annotation of our dataset implicated down regulation of the following canonical pathways in  cpe compared to  cpe: glutathione mediated detoxification, lps/il <dig> mediated inhibition of rxr function, the urea cycle, dopamine and histamine degradation .

molecular functional networks of down-regulated genes in  cpe
we present the most relevant selection of functional molecular networks of genes down-regulated in  ad cpe. we show only those networks which also received ad- literature labels. obviously, the annotation of the canonical pathways and the molecular networks overlap .

cpe function or pathology, and ad literature labels
we labelled our data-driven functional molecular networks with relevant entries known from the literature . we only present those networks which received also ad literature labels. interestingly, multiple networks were labelled with multiple “ad” literature entries. this did not only, posteriorly, validate our dataset further, but also showed that defined molecular networks previously implicated in ad are  activated in cpe cells. oxidative stress labels, csf labels and iron, copper literature labels were assigned several times in the networks. in  cpe stages, a number of networks center on ubiquitin c, indicating an important role for the ubiquitin system in the pathogenesis of ad affected cpe .

individual gene expression changes and quality control microarray data
to validate the  outcome of our current gene expression studies, we performed several confirmatory rt-pcrs in triplicate as a quality control. overall, and similar to the results in our previous neuro-epithelial microarray studies  we found a very good match between the microarray and the qpcr results. the results are summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig> validation of microarray analysis by rt-pcr  of  <dig> selected genes

individual gene expression . in order to assess the validity of the rna expression data obtained by microarray, we performed rt-pcr analysis on cdna prepared from laser-dissected cpe of the same healthy control  and late stage ad samples  as used for the microarray. we essentially followed the procedure of van soest ss et al.   <cit> : in short, rt-pcr validation was done, in triplicate, on a selection of  <dig> genes. these genes were chosen on the basis of high expression level , significantly different expression between late stage ad and healthy control  and high fold change . next, we searched for unique and efficient primers in the last  <dig> kb of the 3′ region the mrna, as this area was used for the design of the oligo’s on the microarray and the microarray amplification procedure employed the poly a tail. we measured three times the expression levels of the resulting set of  <dig> genes by rt-pcr and calculated three times the fc and the relevant p values. table  <dig> summarizes the findings and compares rt-pcrs with the outcome of the microarray. the significant difference as indicated by the microarray was confirmed for  <dig> of these genes, whereas the 17th gene did not amplify well in our hands in the rt-pcr, and showed unexpectedly a very low expression, perhaps due to limitations in primer design. pearson’s correlation coefficient of the fc’s was remarkably high  and significant , confirming the gene expression results of the microarray. f c: fold change in mrna expression of cpe of ad  vs. healthy  donors. pearson’s correlation coefficient between f.c. of micoarray and rt-pcr was significant . rt-pcr# <dig>  rt-pcr# <dig>  rt-pcr# <dig> denote three independent rt-pcrs on  <dig> human control samples and  <dig> and ad affected samples. *some genes are represented with multiple probes on the array. if so, the value shown is the lowest p value. asome genes are represented with multiple probes on the array. if so, the value shown is the mean f.c. bour rt-pcr showed for this gene unexpectedly a very low expression, perhaps due to primer design



we were particularly interested in the downregulation of cldn <dig> mrna in ad affected cpe, since other investigators  <cit>  previously found variable or low expression of cldn <dig> in, respectively, ad affected brain neurons and endothelial cells in the bbb of aging mice. immunohistochemical staining of cldn <dig> in our freshly frozen cpe samples showed that expression of this protein is severely reduced in the ad affected cpe .fig.  <dig> decreased cldn <dig> immunostaining in ad affected cpe. in the healthy cp , choroid plexus epithelial  cells stained positive for cldn <dig> . in the ad tissue  the strings of cpe cells stain much less intensely for cldn <dig>  note that in the same ad tissue, cldn <dig> is clearly present in the blood vessel wall . immunohistochemistry for cldn <dig> on  cryo-sections of cp from a healthy donor  and a donor diagnosed with ad . cldn <dig> was visualized with cy <dig> coupled secondary antibodies after labelling with anti-claudin  <dig> antibody ab <dig> . cy <dig> fluorescence is shown in red. nuclei are stained with dapi . the green color shows the autofluorescence that is detected in the fitc channel. this channel was added to reveal autofluorescence possibly overlapping with the cy <dig> fluorescence marking the presence of cldn <dig>  bar is  <dig> μm



discussion
ad pathophysiology in the cpe: overall features
in this study, we aimed to find consistent gene expression differences between healthy and ad-affected cpe, with corresponding functional annotations. our gene expression data suggests that basic features of ad affected cpe cells change considerably. obviously, whether this is  the cause or  the consequence of ad, or both, need still to be established. nonetheless, our molecular data and functional annotations largely corroborate previous morphological, biochemical and  physiological studies on the same subject. these studies showed ad-related cellular atrophy of the cpe , impaired csf production, clearance and efflux capacity, and altered metabolism of biomolecules by the cpe. ; these themes were recently reviewed by perez-gracia et al.  and krzyzankova et al.   <cit> .

the unfolded protein response in ad-affected cpe cells
the most important canonical pathways upregulated in ad  cpe, compared to  cpe, indicate that cpe cells suffer from increased cellular stress: we found upregulation of the intracellular unfolded protein response, the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, and the protein ubiquitin pathway. the pathways e1f <dig> signalling and the nrf <dig> mediated oxidative stress response were also upregulated in ad affected cpe.

indeed, according to the literature, ad, and other late onset neuro-degenerative disorders, are associated with stress-induced intra-neuronal accumulation of misfolded proteins. affected neurons activate a number of protective mechanisms, such as the unfolded protein response  <cit> , perhaps nonsense mediated rna decay, as well as the er-integrated stress response   <cit>  and the protein ubiquitin pathway  <cit> . in early stages of ad, the isr temporarily decreases protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of eif-2-alpha to reduce the overall protein load in the cell  <cit> . nonetheless, prolonged stress may lead to reduction in the translation of cellular protein and, consequently, neural dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease.

obviously, the cpe is a neuro-epithelium with multiple receptors but, unlike neurons does not have axons, dendrites or synapses. however, by similarity, we hypothesize that, in ad, aβ induced prolonged oxidative stress impairs the major functions of the cpe .

bscfb integrity may be compromised in ad-affected cpe
we found that rna expression of cldn <dig> was down-regulated in the ad-affected cpe cells. we confirmed the much lower presence of cldn- <dig> protein in ad- affected cpe by immunohistochemistry . please note that the observed absence of cldn <dig> protein may be due to either down regulation of its corresponding rna and/or due to post-transcriptional down regulation of the cldn <dig> protein, for example through interaction with the abundantly present ubiquitin complex in the  cpe ; a mechanism suggested by mandel and co-workers in  <dig>  <cit> .

cldn- <dig> is a tight junction protein and the main gatekeeper for paracellular transport over cns-blood barriers. our data, combined with those of the literature, suggests that the integrity of the ectodermal bcsfb barrier, and, consequently, paracellular transport may be compromised in ad. our data corroborates and specifies previous morphological and physiological studies by chalbot et al.  and marques et al.   <cit> , which  directly point toward increased permeability of the bcsfb barrier in ad,

interestingly, in ad-brains, the cldn- <dig> protein appears to be reduced or absent in both the ectodermal bcsfb barrier  as well as in the endothelial bbb barriers  <cit> . nonetheless, given both the structural absence of a tight neurovascular unit at the bcsfb barrier, and the specific bcsfb functions , we hypothesize that cldn <dig> lesions at the bcsfb barrier may have a far more devastating effect on brain homeostasis.

csf production and sink action of ad-affected cpe
in general, two of the major functions of the cpe are csf production and sink-action for waste-products. literature evidence exists that the csf pressure slowly rises in early stages of ad, and drops again in late stages of the disease  <cit> . thus, if we analyse this aspect in healthy  cpe and ad affected  cpe, we expect to get a complicated and mixed molecular picture.

boassa and yool  <dig> previously implicated the aqp <dig> protein in csf production  <cit> . we found that the cpe expression of aqp <dig> remains high in both healthy and ad-affected cpe , which confirms that csf pressure  can only partly explained by the action of this protein  <cit> . we previously published a molecular model of aqueous humor and csf production  <cit>  and we identified a number of relevant genes whose expression was also significantly regulated in our current study: these include atp1b <dig> ; atpase ; kcnj <dig> ; aqp <dig> , kcne <dig>  and phosphates . as we expected, we could not deduce a clear picture which molecular mechanism in the cpe cause csf pressure, in part, to rise and drop again.

nonetheless, two canonical pathways in our data set may be important for csf pressure regulation  and cpe sink action . aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal cortex. it plays a major role in na+, k+, h+ and water homeostasis through transcriptional and translational regulation of electrolyte transport. aldosterone is well known for its role in blood pressure regulation, but was recently also implicated in regulation of csf pressure  <cit> . glutathione-mediated detoxification is a general detoxification pathway, where the first step is catalysed by glutathione transferases . glutathione binds to toxic electrophilic chemicals, forming conjugates, which are exported from the  cell, and, perhaps, removed from the brain. consequently, since the glutathione-mediated detoxification pathway is downregulated, our data may indicate that part of the sink action of the ad-affected cpe is compromised.

further specific observations in ad-affected cpe
we analysed the cpe expression of several genes previously implicated in ad, including app, apoe, psen <dig>  psen <dig>  clu, abca <dig> and ttr. most of these genes are moderately to highly expressed in the cpe. however, no statistical significant gene expression difference could be found for these genes between healthy and affected cpe samples. since the ttr expression was very high, and reached the saturated feature range in both healthy or ad- affected cpe on several microarrays, we could not formally establish a potential difference in ttr expression between healthy and affected cpe. our data indicate that the ad-affected cpe, despite partial loss of cellular integrity, produces at least the same or more ttr compared to non-affected cpe .

we observed in the top  <dig> genes of the highest and lowest gene expression -changes, between  cpe and  cpe, a number of genes with unknown function . we also found genes with more or less known function, but  unknown relationship with ad . finally, we found a number of genes with more or less known function for which a possible relationship with ad may be obvious, or has been described: for example, upregulation of the heat shock proteins hspa <dig>  hspa <dig> and dnajb1/hsp <dig> reflects increasing cellular cpe stress; the prion protein  <dig>  was downregulated. several authors reported conflicting  results of the possible relationship between prnd  and ad  <cit> .

the literature labelling of our molecular  cpe vs  cpe networks  yielded several ad relevant observations. while their exact role in the pathogenesis of ad is frequently not  known, a number of striking observations are briefly highlighted below. literature labelling did not implicate potential human choroid plexus failure in relation to folate processing. however, we did observe changes in several transport entities, such as copper and iron and vitamin c transport or homeostasis. we also observed upregulation of the vitamin d receptor gene  in ad-affected cpe. interestingly, durk et al.  <cit>  found recently that vitamin d <dig> reduces cerebral amyloid beta-accumulation and improved cognition in ad mouse models. in addition, lee yh et al.  <cit>  found, in a meta-analysis, genetic association between two vitamin d receptor  snps and ad. we found upregulation of both the acetylcholine  receptor  and of the ach esterase inhibitor cyp3a <dig> . indeed, several authors showed previously that ad is accompanied by a severe functional deficit in the cholinergic network, which affects both neurotransmission and immune reactions  <cit> . we also found upregulation of glutharedoxin  . glrx is essential to maintain a reduced intracellular environment under conditions of increased oxidative stress. interestingly, arodin and co-workers  <cit>  previously measured an increased release of grx protein in the csf of ad patients. we observed upregulation of the gonadotropin release hormone  gene. our data are in line with the findings of nuruddin et al.   <cit>  who found elevated mrna levels of gnrh and its receptor gnrhr in plaque bearing ad mouse models. next, we noticed upregulation of wiskott-aldrich syndrome family member  <dig> . already in  <dig>  takata and co-workers found co-aggregation of wave protein with modified hyper-phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles in both ad affected brain and 3xtg ad mouse models  <cit> . we found upregulation of the mtorc <dig> gene expression  in ad affected cpe. our data corroborate the findings of several authors, who found that the neuroprotective mtorc <dig> pathway is activated in human ad  <cit>  as well as in relevant mouse models  <cit> . we also observed downregulation of camk, which is most likely involved in phosphorylation of tau in ad  <cit> . finally, we noticed that expression of one or more genes of the g protein coupled receptor group  was downregulated . gpcrs mediate the proteolysis of app and degradation of amyloid beta. vice versa, amyloid supposedly beta perturbs gpcr function  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in ad affected cpe, we found and annotated specific cellular changes probably due to increased oxidative stress, such as the unfolded protein response, e1f <dig> and nrf <dig> signalling and the protein ubiquitin pathway. further, our data suggests that the ad affected bcsfb barrier becomes more permeable due to downregulation of “gatekeeper” cldn <dig>  finally, our data also predicted down regulation of the glutathione mediated detoxification and the urea cycle in the ad cpe, which suggest that the cpe sink action may be impaired. literature labelling of our functional molecular networks confirmed multiple previous  observations in the ad literature and revealed many new ones. we conclude, on the basis of our molecular and functional annotation data, that cpe failure in ad exists.

combining our data with those of the literature, we suggest the following, more or less chronological order of events taking place at the cpe in ad: increased amyloid burden on cpe; increased oxidative stress; despite continuous and high ttr production: decrease of cpe capability to handle increased amyloid burden;  inflammatory signalling; intracellular ubiquitin involvement; remodelling of adherens and tight junctions  causing increased permeability, and, finally, cellular atrophy and barrier disintegration. thus, in ad, the brain barriers, especially the bcsfb, remodel, and may become leaky. the bcsfb increasingly loses its function to support cns homeostasis . taken together, the available data strongly support the concept that cp failure contributes to ad pathogenesis.
