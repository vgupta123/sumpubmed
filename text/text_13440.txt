BACKGROUND
the human small and large bowel accommodates bacteria belonging to more than  <dig> known species, many of which play a mutualistic role in the digestion of dietary nutrients  <cit> . the concept of probiotic bacteria has evolved from a live active culture which improves the balance of the gut microbiota composition, to one that incorporates specific beneficial effects, including maturation of the mucosal adaptive immune system  <cit> . indeed consumption of probiotics such as bifidobacteria has been shown to maintain a healthy intestinal microbial balance and help protect against intestinal infections  <cit> . a significant goal of current research is to understand the complex nature of the probiotic interaction with the innate immune system. this ability to direct and modulate the immune system has significant implications in the areas of atopic disease, cancer and pathogenesis  <cit> . however, despite these potential beneficial properties and a growing industrial and consumer acceptance, bifidobacteria still remain poorly understood at the biochemical, physiological and especially the genetic level  <cit> . current efforts in the field of bifidobacterial genetics are focusing on developing vectors for the genetic manipulation of the species in vitro  <cit> .

in order to confirm a strain-specific probiotic action it is necessary to associate a given health-promoting function with expression of a particular gene product. gene reporter fusions have been used for decades to identify and monitor gene expression  <cit> . traditional reporter systems, based on enzymatic assays, are often limited to in vitro retrospective analysis, typically involving cell disruption and addition of an enzymatic substrate followed by an absorbance measurement. to date, the promoterless gusa gene is the only successful reporter system utilized for bifidobacterium  <cit>  and although valuable for in vitro analysis of gene expression, it is limited by the fact that it is semiquantative and cannot be applied in an in vivo model.

a novel reporter system based on quantified light emission  as a result of lux gene expression has achieved considerable attention in recent times  <cit> . light generation in naturally occurring bioluminescent bacteria is encoded by five essential genes organized in an operon such as luxcdabe. blue-green light is emitted from these bacteria with a peak at  <dig> nm as a result of a heterodimeric luciferase, an enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of reduced flavin mononucleotide  and a long-chain fatty aldehyde . although a number of additional lux genes have been identified, only luxa-e are essential for the biosynthesis of light  <cit> . to date the lux operon has been successfully expressed in a variety of gram-negative bacteria, conferring a bioluminescent phenotype  <cit> . since all identified species of naturally occurring marine and terrestrial bioluminescent bacteria are gram-negative, the generation of gram-positive bioluminescent bacteria has been limited. however, the introduction of gram-positive ribosome binding sites and shuffling of the gene order to luxabcde  <cit>  has facilitated the successful application of the luciferase system in a limited number of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> .

a recent study by guglielmetti  <cit>  reported the use of insect luciferase in b. longum biovar longum as a biosensor to analyze the metabolic state of cells. herein we describe for the first time the development of a lux  based reporter system for the species bifidobacterium. the reporter vector pluxmc <dig> is based on the recently described theta based plasmid pbc <dig> from b. catenatulatum  <cit>  and the luxabcde operon from ppl2lux  <cit> . derivatives of pluxmc <dig>  harbouring a bifidobacterial promoter  as well as a synthetically derived promoter   <cit>  placed upstream of luxabcde, were constructed and found to stably replicate in b. breve ucc <dig>  a strain originally isolated from nursling stool.

the subsequent analysis of these strains allowed us to assess the functionality of pluxmc <dig> both in vitro and in vivo. our results demonstrate the potential of pluxmc <dig> as a real-time, non-invasive reporter system for bifidobacterium. it has also allowed us, for the first time, to track the colonisation potential and persistence of this probiotic species in real time. an interesting and significant outcome of the study is the identification of the caecum as a niche environment for b. breve ucc <dig> 

RESULTS
construction of the luciferase based reporter system pluxmc1
the pluxmc <dig> vector  is a derivative of the shuttle vector pbc <dig>   <cit>  that contains a putative theta-type replication origin and a chloramphenicol  resistance marker. in addition, pluxmc <dig> contains luxabcde, a synthetic operon that contains optimized gram-positive translational initiation sequences upstream of luxa, luxc and luxe  <cit> . the luxabcde operon is divergently orientated with respect to flanking genes on pluxmc <dig> to minimize any potential read-through from upstream promoters. importantly, the use of the sali and swai restriction sites for cloning of pcr-amplified promoters into pluxmc <dig> allowed the creation of transcriptional fusions to the luxabcde operon. furthermore, since the ribosomal binding site and start codon of luxa are absent in pluxmc <dig>  such fusions are also required to include appropriate translational start signals, and thus allow direct identification of correct expression signal insertions by their bioluminescent phenotype in e. coli.

functionality and stability of pluxmc <dig> derivatives
to demonstrate the functionality of the pluxmc <dig> luciferase reporter system in b. breve ucc <dig>  the expression profiles of two promoters and associated translational signals were assessed. the first of these  is the promoter driving the expression of the repc gene from the cryptic b. catenulatum plasmid pbc <dig>  the second is a constitutive optimised promoter , from listeria monocytogenes, where it has been shown to elicit constitutively high activity  <cit> . vectors pluxmc <dig> and pluxmc <dig> containing each of these promoters respectively, were constructed in e. coli and transformed into b. breve ucc <dig> as described in materials and methods.

the stability of all constructs in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure was evaluated. cultures of b. breve ucc <dig> containing pluxmc <dig>  pluxmc <dig> or pluxmc <dig>  were grown for  <dig> generations in mrs medium without antibiotic selection, after which dilutions were plated every  <dig> generations to assess the presence of the plasmids in the resulting colonies by scoring for cm resistance encoded by the pbc <dig>  backbone. all  <dig> colonies tested for each of the three strains at each of the time points were cm-resistant , indicating that the plasmids were stably maintained without antibiotic selection pressure for at least  <dig> generations under the conditions tested. this high level of stability allowed use of the luciferase reporter system in animal experiments in which antibiotic selection pressure could not be maintained.

overnight cultures of the pluxmc-containing b. breve strains were diluted 1: <dig> in mrs medium supplemented with cysteine hcl. growth and bioluminescence were then monitored over time . no difference in growth rates or final optical density were detected between b. breve ucc <dig> harbouring either pluxmc <dig>  pluxmc <dig> or pluxmc <dig>  indicating that luciferase expression at the levels reached during the experiments described here does not influence the growth rate of b. breve ucc <dig>  no bioluminescence was detected at any time for the control strain b. breve ucc <dig> containing pluxmc <dig>  demonstrating the absence of any background signal . for the b. breve strain harbouring pluxmc <dig>  bioluminescence was detected throughout all growth stages, indicating constitutive expression of the lux operon . in contrast, for pluxmc <dig> bioluminescence declined during the late logarithmic phase of growth and further decreased in the stationary phase, until the signal eventually became undetectable. this significant difference in bioluminescence profiles observed for pluxmc <dig> and pluxmc <dig> during stationary phase suggests that differential expression can be monitored in b. breve ucc <dig> using the luciferase reporter system.

expression in a murine model
the suitability of the pluxmc <dig> reporter system to monitor gene expression in vivo was investigated in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. three groups of three mice were orally inoculated with b. breve ucc <dig> containing either pluxmc <dig>  pluxmc <dig> or pluxmc <dig>  whole body image analysis was performed  <dig> days following the final inoculation. no distinct luminescent signal was observed for any of the groups which may be explained by the findings of rice et al,  <cit>  who reported that cell numbers in excess of  <dig> are required to detect signals at  <dig> cm depth in tissue. shedding of b. breve ucc <dig> containing the pluxmc derivatives in the faeces was detected throughout the twelve-day trial period. the administered bacterial populations increased in number in the faecal samples up to day  <dig>  reaching a plateau at approximately  <dig> cfu g- <dig> stool, declining to around  <dig> cfu g- <dig> stool at day  <dig> post inoculation . nine days following initial inoculation the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the levels of bioluminescence in the intact gi tracts were determined and correlated with the numbers of bacterial cells recovered on selective medium . notably, the numbers of cfu recovered from the mice inoculated with all three strains were very similar, suggesting that luciferase expression does not influence the persistence of b. breve ucc <dig>  the results also confirm that the bioluminescence data is quantitative, correlating with the number of bacteria present. however, viable counts were found to have higher limits of detection than luminometry. no bioluminescence was detected in the gi tracts of the three mice in the control group. in contrast, the caecum obtained from the two groups of mice fed with either b. breve ucc <dig> pluxmc <dig> or ucc <dig> pluxmc <dig> displayed relatively high levels of bioluminescence. the detection limits of the ivis <dig> imaging system  were determined to be approximately  <dig> bacteria within a given focus, which correlates well with previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, in contrast to the in vitro expression profile, both vectors were detected to an equal extent in the gastrointestinal tract after  <dig> days. the data clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the pluxmc reporter system to monitor bifidobacterial gene expression in the murine gi tract.

dynamics of colonization and persistence of b. breve ucc2003
colonization and clearance of b. breve ucc <dig> harbouring pluxmc <dig>  or pluxmc <dig>  was monitored over a thirty-three day period by following bioluminescence and viable counts recovered from both the gi tract and faecal samples. two groups of mice  were orally inoculated with either the control or test strain. shedding of b. breve ucc <dig> control and test strains in the faeces was detected throughout the trial with no statistically significant differences observed between the two groups. the inoculated bacterial population increased in number , reaching a maximum of ~ <dig> cfu g- <dig> faeces at day  <dig>  from day 10– <dig> the level of ucc <dig> shed plateaus at ~ <dig> cfu g- <dig> faeces. following day  <dig> there is a steady decline to ~ <dig> cfu g- <dig> until days  <dig> and  <dig> when a marginal increase in faecal shedding was observed.

on day  <dig>  the gi tract recovered from a single test animal showed detectable bioluminescence originating from both the lower small intestine and the caecum, with little signal detectable in the colon. viable counts of both stool and tissue samples taken on day  <dig> from both test and control fed mice revealed that b. breve ucc <dig> was present within the colonic mucosa, suggesting that at this time point microcolonies, consisting of at less than  <dig> bacteria had formed. within  <dig> days of inoculation, the majority of the bolus of bacteria had travelled through the gut, with some of the inoculum remaining in the lower small intestine; bioluminescence on day  <dig> from this portion of the gi tract corresponded with the presence of a large food bolus. after the initial bolus had passed no detectable luminescence was observed from the small intestine and the level of bacteria detected by viable counts fell to ~ <dig> cfu g- <dig> 

while b. breve ucc <dig> numbers remained detectable by viable colony counts, verified by colony pcr, for both the small intestine and colonic samples at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and day  <dig> the counts remained close to  <dig> cfu g- <dig> tissue which is below the limits of bioluminescence detection of the xenogen ivis <dig> system for intact organs. interestingly, the caecum remained colonised throughout the trial . once again bioluminescence data strongly correlated with the number of bacteria present in homogenized tissue samples. colonisation of the caecum was evident from day  <dig> and by day  <dig> the caecum was the only portion of the gi tract where bioluminescence could be detected corresponding to a log increase in the number of cfu. colonisation of the caecum peaked at day  <dig> and by day  <dig> the caecum was the only portion of the gi tract containing significant numbers of the inoculated bacteria . the reduced levels of b. breve ucc <dig> observed in the caecum at day  <dig> correlated with a marginal increase in shedding observed on day  <dig> and  <dig> possibly reflecting the clearance of the administered b. breve ucc <dig> from the murine gi tract .

contribution of the native bifidobacterial population
previous studies have reported native bifidobacterial populations in the murine gi tract of  <dig> cfu g- <dig> for the small intestine and  <dig> cfu g- <dig> for the colon including the caecum  <cit> . to establish if this trend was evident throughout the persistence study, aliquots of homogenised tissue samples were plated on rca containing mupirocin, which has been previously reported as a selective agent for bifidobacterium  <cit> . total bifidobacterial counts from the caecum followed a similar trend to that of the inoculated bacteria levels, beginning at  <dig> on day  <dig>  rising to  <dig> by day  <dig> before reducing to  <dig> at day  <dig>  the bifidobacterial population in the colon remained relatively constant at ~ <dig> while the small intestine showed an initial total population of  <dig> on day  <dig> followed by a plateau at ~ <dig> throughout the remainder of the trial. random colonies displaying bifidobacterial morphology which were not chloramphenicol resistant were further analysed, chromosomal dna was extracted and a pcr targeting the 16s intergenic spacer region  <cit>  allowed us to identify five species of bifidobacteria native to these murine intestines with blast homology to b. longum, b. adolescentis , b. animalis and b. animalis subsp lactis.

discussion
in this study we describe the construction of a luciferase-based reporter system, pluxmc <dig>  and the successful application of this system to track b. breve ucc <dig> growth in vitro  and in vivo . the vector pluxmc <dig>  similar to ppl2lux  <cit> , allows for the construction of exact translational/transcriptional fusions of promoters to the luciferase-encoding genes. as consensus promoters in the genus bifidobacterium are not well defined, we chose to evaluate a native bifidobacterial expression signal , which is located upstream of repc on the cryptic plasmid pbc <dig> and which was previously shown to be essential for pbc <dig> replication  <cit> . we also examined phelp  <cit> , a promoter developed for constitutive gene expression in l. monocytogenes and a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative species  <cit> . both of the luciferase-expressing b. breve strains displayed growth characteristics similar to those of control strains and no background bioluminescence was observed during any of the experiments. this highlights the major advantage of luciferase-based reporter systems when compared to the glucuronidase-based reporter systems currently available for bifidobacteria  <cit> .

one potential caveat to the use of the luciferase-based system for b. breve is that the oxygen requirements for the effective functioning of luxabcde have to be fulfilled by an anaerobic bacterium in a supposedly anaerobic environment  <cit> . the oxygen dependence of bacterial luciferase has previously been critically studied in light of certain in vivo imaging applications and we concur with hardy et al.  <cit>  that the presence of a luminescent signal at a particular site indicates that sufficient oxygen is present for the reaction to occur, but that bacterial counts should in the first instance be determined to confirm that the level of luminescence is correlated to a certain number of cells under a given set of experimental conditions. the determination of a direct correlation was not possible through whole-body imaging of b. breve ucc2003-inoculated mice and indeed this analysis may not be possible using the current system as, regardless of the light source, transmission depends on the type of tissue and the depth of the light source in the animal  <cit> . future efforts to obtain such images may involve imaging the mice at a later stage of colonization, increasing lux expression levels or increasing the cell densities through the exploitation of bifidobacterial-specific growth promoting factors such as non-digestible oligosaccharides  <cit> .

the ability of b. breve ucc <dig> to express a lux+ phenotype in vivo was initially investigated over a period of twelve days using bioluminescence as well as viable count measurements. analysis of the two pluxmc-containing strains revealed that the in vitro expression profile was not reflected in vivo. the phelp promoter of pluxmc <dig> gives significantly higher bioluminescence expression to prep of pluxmc <dig>  during stationary-phase growth under laboratory conditions; however, under in vivo conditions the difference in expression is no longer apparent indicating that in the murine model the native bifidobacterial promoter prep is as suitable to drive luciferase expression as the constitutive promoter phelp.

the luminescence of microbial cells is strongly dependent on metabolic activity, making the lux+ phenotype an indicator of metabolic integrity  <cit> . during in vitro growth of many bacterial species harbouring the lux operon, bioluminescence declines when cells enter stationary phase  <cit> . this pattern of light production was observed in vitro for b. breve ucc <dig> containing pluxmc <dig> and this may be caused by a decrease in metabolic activity. the tight correlation between luminescence and viable counts obtained from both stool and organ homogenates during colonisation of mice with b. breve ucc <dig> suggests that, similar to what has previously been reported for citrobacter rodentium  <cit> , colonizing bacteria are metabolically similar to those seen during the exponential phase of in vitro growth and that intracellular cofactors are not limiting.

the bioluminescent b. breve ucc2003::pluxmc <dig> was subsequently exploited to investigate in situ and in real time, the dynamics of colonization of orally inoculated mice over a 33-day period. the short half-life  of the luciferase enzyme  <cit> , coupled with a very low level of background luminescence in mammalian tissue makes bioluminescence an excellent reporter system for analysing colonization of a host intestine by bacteria as observations occur in real time and do not reflect accumulated signal.

the most striking finding of this study is that primary colonization of the mouse by b. breve ucc <dig> takes place within the caecum. although bifidobacterial species have previously been isolated at  <dig> cfu/g from pig caecal contents  <cit> ,  <dig> cfu/g from rabbit  <cit> ,  <dig> cfu/ml from human  <cit> , and  <dig> cfu/g from hen  <cit> , this is the first time that the caecum has been implicated as the predominant colonization site for these bacteria. interestingly, pathogens such as ehec o157:h <dig>  <cit>  and c. rodentium  <cit>  also exhibit murine caecal colonization. histologically the organisation of the caecum is similar to peyer's patches  with domed villi containing m cells and dendritic cells. a variety of pathogens exhibit a tropism for pp. following adhesion, enteroinvasive yersinia, shigella, and salmonella sp. enter pp and are able to multiply within this tissue  <cit> . in s. typhimurium targeting of the pathogen to pp is mediated by surface components including the long polar fimbriae which when inactivated impairs the colonization of murine pp  <cit> . the first stage of colonization within the caecal patch of the mouse intestine by c. rodentium is also proposed to be mediated by the synergistic action of fimbriael operons  <cit> .

the caecum may be the site which allows certain pathogens to adapt to the intestinal environment, and where genes required for efficient colonization of the colon are activated  <cit> . the caecum may also act as a reservoir, shedding bacteria into the colon. it is interesting to note that for c. rodentium the caecal patch is also the first site to be cleared of infection and that clearance of the colon follows shortly afterwards  <cit> . evidence exists that the best protection against mucosal attachment and invasion by such pathogens is by keeping intestinal microbiota in a state that affords colonisation resistance against pathogens by modulation of the microbiota inducing luminal or systemic effects which are beneficial to the host's health  <cit> . it is conceivable that b. breve ucc <dig> may act through competitive exclusion in the caecum, at least in the murine model, and that their presence may prevent pathogenic bacteria from becoming established.

CONCLUSIONS
the application of pluxmc <dig> derivatives has significant potential to allow further study of the interaction of bifidobacteria with a mammalian host. the system has the distinct advantage of allowing direct comparison of different promoter activities in intact animal tissue. this reporter system is a valuable addition to the arsenal of genetic tools available for bifidobacteria as it can be employed for in situ real-time investigation of promoter activities both in vitro and in vivo. currently, the luciferase reporter system is being exploited in our laboratory to explore expression profiles for b. breve ucc <dig> chromosomal genes to further our understanding of transcription signals in this strain . the wealth of information regarding gene expression that will become available from this type of approach is expected to contribute significantly to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying b. breve ucc <dig> behaviour in situ.
