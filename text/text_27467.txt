BACKGROUND
the ovaries and testes both develop from an identical structure, the embryonic genital ridge  <cit> . germ cells do not originate from within the genital ridges but differentiate from clusters of cells located in the extra-embryonic proximal epiblast  <cit> . primordial germ cells  proliferate and migrate via the embryonal endoderm reaching the gonadal ridges at about 5th week of pregnancy in the human . within the genital ridge germ cells have been shown to express the pluripotency markers oct <dig>  and nanog  <cit>  and human embryonic germ cell lines, capable of differentiating into a number of cell lineages, have been established from early gonadal tissue  <cit> . we have previously reported that during the 1st trimester of pregnancy the germ cells  in the testicular cords all express oct <dig> but that only a subpopulation of germ cells remains oct <dig> positive during the 2nd trimester  <cit> . in previous studies oct <dig> positive germ cells were detected in the cortical region of human fetal ovaries recovered during the 2nd trimester  <cit> ; however expression of oct <dig> has not been investigated in the 1st trimester ovary.

studies in knockout mice have identified a number of genes the expression of which is critical for germ cell survival and functional maturation in both ovary and testis. one such gene is dazl, an rna binding protein that is a member of a conserved gene family members of which include boule and daz  <cit> . a second example is mvh  a gene that encodes an rna helicase which is specific to the germ cell lineage  <cit> . in mice dazl mrna is first detectable in post-migratory germ cells on e <dig>   <cit>  and the protein has been immunolocalised to the cytoplasm of fetal and adult germ cells  <cit> . targeted deletion of the dazl gene results in germ cell loss in both males and females  <cit> . in dazl -/- females germ cell loss occurred in fetal ovaries at the time of meiotic entry and adult ovaries did not contain oocytes  <cit> . in dazl -/- males the pattern of germ cell loss is variable and in some studies has been reported to occur during fetal life  <cit>  whilst in others it was associated with spermatogonial differentiation  <cit>  or entry to meiosis  <cit> .

vasa is a member of the dead box family of genes first identified in drosophila where it was shown to be essential for female germ cell development  <cit> . in mice with targeted deletions of mvh ovarian function appeared normal but males were infertile with demise of germ cells at the zygotene stage of meiosis  <cit> . mvh has been detected in germ cells on e <dig>  immediately after colonisation of the gonad but not in migratory pgcs  <cit> . information on expression of vasa in human fetal gonads is limited but protein was detected in oct <dig> negative cells in a testis at  <dig> weeks gestation  <cit> . first trimester ovaries have not been examined but in the 2nd trimester vasa has been localised to oocytes within primordial follicles  <cit> .

in the present paper we have extended our studies on the germ cell subpopulations within the human fetal ovaries and testes to determine when and where dazl and vasa proteins are expressed and have performed co-staining for oct <dig> as this is commonly used to delineate the germ 'stem cell' population  <cit> . these studies have revealed a dynamic and overlapping pattern in the expression of these germ cell markers, revealed that nuclear localisation of dazl parallels the onset of vasa expression, and highlighted similarities in the development of male and female germ cell lineages.

RESULTS
expression of mrnas for oct <dig>  dazl and vasa in first and second trimester gonads
in ovaries oct <dig> mrna was detected in both the 1st and 2nd trimester samples with a slight, but non-significant decrease in the older samples . in contrast the amount of mrna for dazl and vasa was very low in 1st trimester ovaries but was markedly increased in the 2nd trimester dazl  <dig> fold and vasa  <dig> fold ,. analysis of individual ovarian samples showed a very high correlation between expression of dazl and vasa mrnas . in the testis, oct <dig> and dazl mrnas were detectable in both 1st and 2nd trimester with no significant difference between ages . expression of vasa mrna in the testis was low/barely detectable in the 1st trimester and showed a significant increase in the 2nd trimester  although this was less marked than that seen in ovarian samples .

western analysis of total protein levels
in both ovaries and testes vasa protein was not detected in samples from the 1st trimester  but an increase in the amount of vasa was noted during the 2nd trimester  which was particularly striking in the ovarian samples .

dazl protein was detected in both 1st and 2nd trimester testes  but only in the 2nd trimester ovaries . oct <dig> was detected in extracts from ovaries and testes obtained during both 1st and 2nd trimesters .

immunolocalisation of oct <dig>  dazl and vasa revealed differential patterns of expression in both ovary and testis
immunoexpression of oct <dig>  dazl and vasa was germ cell specific in all samples. oct <dig> positive germ nuclei were detected in both 1st and 2nd trimester ovaries  and testes . in both sexes immunopositive cells were distributed throughout the organ during the 1st trimester. in 2nd trimester testes oct <dig> positive germ cells were detected in all seminiferous cords whereas in the ovary expression of oct <dig> positive nuclei was largely confined to the peripheral cortex . dazl was immunolocalised to the nuclei of germ cells in 1st trimester gonads in both sexes. in 2nd trimester ovaries dazl immunostaining was largely cytoplasmic and appeared to be most prominent in groups of cells , whereas in the testes germ cells with nuclear or cytoplasmic staining were detected throughout the organ . no vasa immunopositive cells were detected in 1st trimester gonads from either sex . in the 2nd trimester ovaries vasa staining was cytoplasmic and more intense in germ cells less peripherally located than those expressing oct <dig> ; in testes vasa positive cells were distributed throughout the organ.

co-localisation of oct <dig> and dazl
in 1st trimester ovaries and testes  oct <dig> and dazl were co-expressed in germ cell nuclei. in the 2nd trimester ovaries  germ cells containing intense positive nuclear immunoreactivity for oct <dig> were immunonegative for dazl; in a few cells with low levels of oct <dig>  a small amount of cytoplasmic dazl was detected. in contrast, intense immunoexpression of dazl was detected in the cytoplasm of less peripherally located groups of oogonia . however in 2nd trimester testes dazl immunoexpression was heterogeneous with nuclear  as well as cytoplasmic staining in oct <dig> positive cells as well as cytoplasmic expression in cells that were oct <dig> negative .

differential expression of oct <dig> and vasa
in 1st trimester ovaries and testes all germ cells contained oct <dig> positive nuclei but were immunonegative for vasa . in the 2nd trimester, oct <dig> positive germ cells were located at the periphery of the ovary whereas the most intense immunoexpression of vasa was detected in the cytoplasm of oct <dig> negative germ cells  located in nests  in the central region. expression of oct <dig> and vasa was almost mutually exclusive although some cells in a transition zone between the peripheral cells that contained intense oct <dig> staining and the nests of vasa positive cells  did appear to have low levels of vasa in their cytoplasm and some nuclear oct <dig>  in the testes a the majority of germ cells  containing intense immunoexpression of oct <dig> were located in the central portion of the seminiferous cords and these cells were vasa negative . as in the ovary germ cells that contained intense cytoplasmic staining for vasa were oct <dig> negative, these were often found in groups at the periphery of the cords. nuclear expression of vasa was detected in some germ cells . as in the ovary rare germ cells containing very low levels of cytoplasmic vasa as well as low intensity staining for oct <dig> were observed .

differential and overlapping expression of dazl and vasa
the above data suggested that expression of dazl and vasa was similar but not identical, in both ovary and testis. this was directly investigated by dual immunohistochemistry for dazl and vasa in the 2nd trimester . this identified the presence of three populations of germ cells in both ovary and testis based on their patterns of expression of dazl and vasa. firstly a rare population of cells that expressed nuclear dazl alone, secondly cells which co-expressed both proteins , and thirdly cells which were vasa positive/dazl negative  which were the most prevalent. although only few cells in population  <dig> were detected in testes these germ cells were found as distinct groups within the ovary . oocytes within primordial follicles expressed vasa with low/absent expression of dazl.

in the ovarian samples the pattern of expression was further investigated by measuring germ cell diameter at  <dig> representative gestations  as our previous studies have established that cell diameter provides an indication of the maturational status of the human fetal female germ cell  <cit> . this demonstrated that dazl-predominant germ cells were smaller than germ cells showing marked expression of both proteins, which were in turn smaller than germ cells expressing vasa alone . these differences were significant at each gestational age examined . this analysis also demonstrated that germ cells expressing only dazl showed an increase in diameter from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks gestation, the cells found in groups that expressed both dazl and vasa increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  and those predominantly expressing vasa from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm .

discussion
germ cells within the male and female gonads develop from an apparently homogeneous bi-potential population of pgc. in both male and female human fetal gonads germ cells initially proliferate but thereafter their fates diverge with female germ cells entering meiotic prophase as early as  <dig> weeks gestation  whereas meiotic entry is does not occur until puberty in males. in rodents male germ cells removed from the testicular environment and placed in vitro can spontaneously enter meiosis emphasising the common developmental potential of the germ cells in the two sexes and the critical role played by the testicular environment in modifying germ cell fate  <cit> .

in the current study we have used oct <dig> immunohistochemistry to identify the subpopulation of putative 'germ stem' cells in human fetal testes and ovaries. studies from our own laboratory  <cit>  have already established that expression of oct <dig> is restricted to the gonocyte population of human testicular germ cells whilst others  <cit>  have reported that this protein is localised to oogonia in the ovary. expression of dazl and vasa was compared to oct <dig> as studies in knockout mice have reported that both genes are essential for germ cell maturation in that species  <cit> . analysis of ovarian extracts revealed a striking increase in the total amount of both dazl and vasa mrna and protein in the ovary as development progressed into the 2nd trimester. a similar trend in expression was noted in the testes but was less striking. expression of oct <dig> was maintained in both ovary and testis at all gestational ages examined consistent with persistence of a putative germ 'stem cell' population for many months in the human gonads although the extent to which these cells can acquire/maintain pluripotency in vitro remains unresolved . in the 2nd trimester testis all seminiferous cords contained a mixture of oct <dig> positive and oct <dig> negative germ cells a situation which is different to that in rodents where the expression of oct <dig> is down regulated synchronously in all germ cells within the cords before birth  <cit> . in the human fetal ovary expression of oct <dig> protein was restricted to oogonia in the peripheral zone of the organ, in agreement with the observations of stoop et al. <cit> . in mice expression of oct <dig> mrna is extinguished in a rostro-caudal wave coincident with meiotic entry of germ cells  <cit> .

co-incident and overlapping patterns of expression of these germ cell specific proteins were revealed by fluorescent co-immunolocalisation on fixed specimens from a range of gestational ages. previous studies have immunolocalised dazl in a small number of samples recovered in the 2nd trimester  <cit>  but we believe this is the first study to document expression in 1st trimester samples and to compare expression with that of oct <dig> and vasa. in the 1st trimester, dazl was detected in the nuclear compartment in oct <dig> positive germ cells in both sexes. in a previous study we immunolocalised dazl to the nuclei of male germ cells in a single sample at  <dig> weeks gestation and in the cytoplasm of female germ cells at  <dig> weeks  <cit> . other studies have claimed that dazl is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of male germ cells at 20– <dig> weeks  <cit> . we have extended these observations and demonstrated that dazl is localised to the nuclear compartment in oct <dig> positive cells . in the ovaries localisation of dazl to the cytoplasmic compartment appeared to be transient occurring as oct <dig> expression but thereafter the amount of protein declined and was low in the largest ovarian germ cells, i.e. those that had formed into primordial follicles and those approaching that stage. this was evident when a morphometric analysis was performed showing that the germ cells immunopositive for dazl alone were smaller than those containing both dazl and vasa, which were in turn smaller than those only immunopositive for vasa.

two studies on human populations have provided preliminary evidence that expression of dazl is important for normal functioning of the human germ line. the first study reported a strong association between several common single nucleotide polymorphisms  and age at menopause in a sample population of  <dig> women  <cit> . in a second study a patient with premature ovarian failure at age  <dig> was found to contain a homozygous mutation of dazl  in a region of the protein critical for rna binding  <cit> . the situation in men is complicated by the presence of multiple copies of the closely related daz gene on the y chromosome, deletions of which have been frequently documented as a cause of male infertility  <cit> . however a patient with a homozygous mutation in dazl  was reported to be azoospermic  <cit> .

the marked increase in expression of vasa between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks gestation suggested to us that this was coincident with the entry of female germ cells into meiosis. however increases in both protein and mrna were also demonstrated in male germ cells suggesting that the onset of expression of vasa was associated the maturation of the gonocytes into prespermatogonia rather than meiotic entry per se. in the ovary vasa was detected in the cytoplasm of in slightly larger, more mature germ cells than dazl, and was also present in oocytes within primordial follicles. previous studies that have detected expression of vasa in cytoplasm of germ cells within the fetal ovary and testes at  <dig> weeks gestation  <cit> . co-staining of sections with oct <dig> and vasa has extended these findings by demonstrating that vasa protein is not expressed in gonocytes or oogonia in the 1st trimester and provides a useful method for identifying the different populations of germ cells present within the 2nd trimester gonads.

examination of the 3' utr of the mvh mrna has revealed a number of putative dazl-binding sites that are conserved between human, rat and mouse  <cit> . our data provide some additional support for a role for dazl in initiating expression of vasa although further studies are required preferably using isolated human germ cells. dazl has also been implicated in the regulation of other conserved germ-cell rna-binding proteins including pum <dig>  <cit> , the human homolog of pumilio that is required for maintenance of germ line stem cells in drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans.

CONCLUSIONS
by documenting the differential and partially overlapping patterns of expression of oct <dig>  dazl and vasa proteins in the human fetal ovary and testis we have gained new insight into parallels in the maturation of germ cells in these two organs. our findings clearly demonstrate changes in overall germ cell maturation with increasing gestation, and indicate a switch from oct <dig> expression in the less mature germ cells  to vasa expression in the more mature germ cells . in testicular samples germ cells at different stages of maturation co-exist within the same seminiferous cords. both male and female germ cells showed a similar pattern of change with development, despite the onset of meiosis in the female but not in the male, suggesting that although increases in expression of dazl and vasa in the ovary may be related to meiotic entry there are underlying developmental patterns common to both sexes.
