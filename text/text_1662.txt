BACKGROUND
it is estimated that  <dig> - <dig>  million persons in the united states are living with long-term or lifelong effects of traumatic brain injury   <cit> . approximately  <dig>  million new tbis are sustained each year  <cit>  resulting in  <dig>  deaths  <cit>  and as many as  <dig>  additional people that have long-term behavioral deficits  <cit> . efforts to implement preventative measures for the leading causes of tbi  are critical  <cit>  but will not eliminate tbi as a major public health problem. development of effective clinical treatment protocols post-tbi and potential prophylactic agents for military usage are necessary to address those tbis that cannot be prevented.

injury to the brain results in irreversible damage at the site of impact and initiates cellular and molecular processes that lead to delayed or secondary neural injury in the surrounding tissue  <cit> . neuroprotective strategies target these processes in an attempt to halt the progression of or prevent the delayed injury  <cit> . these processes include inflammation, damage to the blood brain barrier, release of excitatory amino acids, oxidative stress, cerebral edema, reduced cerebral blood flow, hypoxia, and ischemia  <cit> . in the current study, we used gene microarray analysis to determine which genes, pathways and networks were significantly altered after unilateral controlled cortical impact , an experimental model of tbi.

microarray technology is a very powerful tool that allows the user to examine expression profiles for thousands of genes at one time. the true power of microarray technology can be maximized when the expression profiles can be attributed to significant alterations in biological functions and molecular pathways. fortunately, the recent development of advanced bioinformatic analysis tools has made the utilization of microarray data more practical and allows for easier replication. one such tool is the ingenuity pathway analysis  software program which uses a database built from published scientific literature to draw direct and indirect interactions between genes and to assign genes to specific biological functions and canonical pathways  <cit> . ipa was used here for functional, canonical pathway, and network analysis of the genes that were altered by tbi. we examined gene expression on both sides of the brain in order to understand the alterations both locally  and remotely on the opposite side of the brain . we observed that the contralateral side of the brain, which has often been used as a control in similar experiments, exhibited significant alterations in gene expression following tbi.

the bioinformatic analysis tools we used also allowed for both identification of key molecules and elucidation of their interactions with each other. we used these interactions to identify molecules and molecular pathways central in the response to tbi that could provide novel targets for therapeutic strategies. understanding how local and remote gene expression profiles change following tbi, when compared to non-injured brain, will provide valuable insight into delayed neuronal injury mechanisms as well as intrinsic neuroprotective processes.

RESULTS
principal component analysis
the ipsilateral, contralateral, and naïve gene datasets generated 24 hours post-tbi were analyzed by principal component analysis  to assess the variability of our microarray data. nine principal components were generated and the first  <dig> principal components explain  <dig> % of the variance in our microarray data. the 3d score plot generated from these identified injury status as the major source of variability . similarity between data points in the pca was determined by the distance between the points, with shorter distance indicating increased similarity. each data point represents one animal's gene expression profile. ipsilateral, contralateral and naïve all clustered together by injury status and each group was well isolated from the other two groups.

functional analysis
a total of  <dig> biological functions met ipa's threshold and cutoff conditions for the tbi-i  dataset. inspection of the top  <dig> biological functions associated with the dataset in ipa showed that  <dig> of these functions are explicitly cellular in nature; cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular development, cell death, cell cycle, cell morphology, and immune cell trafficking . of the other top functions,  <dig> are disease and disorder related; cancer, neurological disease, genetic disorder, skeletal and muscular disorders, and dermatological diseases and conditions. we posited that the majority of these functional categories had an inflammatory component and inflammatory response  itself was ranked as the 15th most significant biological function for our dataset. to further investigate this, we calculated the percentage of gene overlap each function had with inflammatory response. this overlap ranged from 26% to 93% with  <dig> biological functions falling in the 35% to 55% range . the cumulative overlap of ir with the other  <dig> top biological functions was  <dig> %. therefore, we chose to focus our subsequent analysis techniques on the inflammatory response genes in this study because of the significant involvement of inflammatory genes in all of the top ranked biological functions and the role of the ir in secondary neural injury  <cit> .

histology and immunohistochemistry
histology and immunostaining were used to assess damage to and the inflammatory state of the brain. figure  <dig> demonstrates cortical damage to the brain tissue ipsilateral to the injury by fluoro-jade b  and dapi staining . near the site of impact, the integrity of the cortex is disrupted and there is obvious tissue loss. ed- <dig> immunostaining showed that many activated microglia/macrophages were present in the area of tissue damage . the contralateral side of the brain showed no overt structural damage or ed- <dig> immunoreactivity .

the hippocampal region did not display overt structural damage on either side of the brain  but did show cellular damage ipsilaterally when stained with fjb . ed- <dig> staining similarly showed only macrophage/microglial activation in the hippocampus on the ipsilateral side of the brain . no cortical or hippocampal labeling was seen in negative control sections . any apparent staining in the contralateral hemisphere represented autofluorescence and was similar to levels detected in negative controls.

in contrast to ed- <dig>  cd11b stains all microglia regardless of activation state. when the microglia transform into activated macrophages they also undergo a morphological transformation from a resting ramified state to an amoeboid state. figure  <dig> demonstrates that this morphological shift only occurred in areas of cellular damage. there were no amoeboid shaped microglia detected on the contralateral side . ipsilaterally, both microglial morphologies were observed. ramified microglia were seen in subcortical regions that did not exhibit cellular damage  and amoeboid microglia were present at the site of impact  and in subcortical regions where cellular damage had occurred. this duality can be seen definitively in the ipsilateral hippocampal region where there is cellular damage interspersed between structurally intact tissue . no immunostaining was seen in the cortex or hippocampus in negative control sections .

inflammatory gene expression patterns
focusing on the inflammatory response genes in our datasets, we determined that  <dig> ir genes had a greater than 2-fold change in expression. of these genes,  <dig> genes changed on both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the brain. in order to determine whether these common genes changed differently on one side of the brain compared to the other, we calculated the ratio of the tbi-i fold change to the tbi-c  fold change. those genes that had a tbi-i/tbi-c ratio greater than  <dig>  were determined to have change differently. we observed that  <dig> of the common ir genes  changed similarly . of the genes that changed similarly,  <dig> genes  increased in expression and  <dig> genes  decreased in expression. the remaining  <dig> common ir genes  were changed differently  . table  <dig> shows the  <dig> common ir genes that change differently. these genes span all cellular compartments  with diverse molecule types. the expression of all these genes was lower on the contralateral side of the brain. because of their different expression patterns, these genes became our first group of genes of interest . notable genes identified included ccnd <dig>  spp <dig>  erap <dig>  lyn, thra, timp <dig>  the transcription regulators stat <dig>  cebpd, and cbl, and the plasma membrane receptors and signaling molecules il6st, cd <dig>  egfr, itga <dig>  and sdc <dig> 

tbi-i/tbi-c ratio: gene increased on both sides: ratio = /; gene decreased on both sides: ratio = 1/;

gene increased ipsilaterally and decreased contralaterally: ratio = /-.

there were  <dig> ir genes that changed uniquely on the ipsilateral side of the brain.  <dig> of those genes  increased while  <dig> genes  decreased in expression . only  <dig> ir genes change uniquely on the contralateral side of the brain and, in contrast to what we observed on the ipsilateral side, only  <dig> genes  increased while  <dig> genes  decreased in expression .

canonical pathway analysis
we used canonical pathway and network analysis in ipa to identify genes in our datasets that were most relevant to the observed ir. because ipa displays only the relative expression values, we defined goi, in this context, as those genes that either increased or decreased on one side of the brain and showed no change in expression on the other side or genes that had opposite changes in expression. these genes were easily identified by side-by-side comparison of the canonical pathway and gene networks overlaid with the expression values of the tbi-i and tbi-c ir datasets. canonical pathways in ipa are well-characterized metabolic and cell signaling pathways derived from information found in specific journal articles, review articles, text books, and kegg ligand  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the il- <dig> signaling canonical pathway. ipa determined that this pathway was highly associated with the tbi-i dataset. additionally, this pathway also includes elements of il- <dig>  tnf-α, and lipopolysaccharide  signaling. il- <dig> and tnf-α were previously associated with tbi and inflammation  <cit>  and tbi induced inflammation has been shown to be exacerbated by lps challenge  <cit> . by overlaying the relative expression values for all tbi-i ir genes  and all tbi-c ir genes , we were able to identify a number of goi that were increased in tbi-i and were either unchanged or decreased in tbi-c, including il1b, several transmembrane cytokine receptors and the transcriptional regulators nfkb, stat <dig>  cebpb , and fos.

gene network analysis
in contrast to canonical pathways, which are relatively immutable in ipa, gene networks are generated de novo in ipa based on the list of genes that are imported. ipa takes “seed” molecules from the gene list, searches the ingenuity knowledge base, and uses a network algorithm to draw connections between molecules based on biological function  <cit> . in order to generate networks that included ir genes that changed on both sides of the brain, we combined the tbi-i and tbi-c datasets and performed an ipa core analysis on that union dataset. ipa scores the networks in order to rank them according to their degree of relevance to the network eligible molecules in your dataset  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the highest scored network associated with our union dataset. for this network, we overlaid the relative expression values for the unique tbi-i ir genes  and unique tbi-c ir genes  and were able to identify  <dig> goi, such as the chemokine cxcl <dig>  a number of cytokine and toll-like receptors, heat shock proteins, and transcriptional regulators that were increased in tbi-i and were either unchanged or decreased in tbi-c. interestingly, irf <dig> was upregulated on the contralateral side of the brain.

figure  <dig> shows another network that was scored in the top three networks associated with our union dataset. for this network, we overlaid the relative expression values for all tbi-i ir genes  and all tbi-c ir genes  and were able to identify  <dig> goi including the cytokine cxcl <dig>  a number of genes in the jak/stat pathway, nfkb and several genes associated with apoptosis.

because the ir is, in part, humoral in nature, we created a network within ipa by seeding it with ir cytokines and growth factors expressed uniquely in the tbi-i dataset and “growing them”  to the tbi-i/tbi-c union dataset. figure  <dig> shows the resultant network. by overlaying the relative expression values for all tbi-i ir genes  and all tbi-c ir genes , we were able to identify  <dig> more goi. notable genes were il1b, chemokines ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig>  peptidases mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  and mmp <dig> and many inflammation associated transcription factors.

compiling the gene interaction hierarchy 
by combining the goi identified through canonical pathway and network analysis with those in table  <dig>  we identified a total of  <dig> goi. in order to determine which genes might be most relevant in the ir, we ranked these genes relative to each other by the number of direct interactions each had with the other goi. our analysis showed that  <dig> of the goi formed an interconnected network, leaving  <dig> “orphan” genes . genes having more than  <dig> connections  within the main goi network were considered “primary” in this analysis . genes having 5– <dig> connections were considered “secondary”  and those with less than  <dig> connections were considered “peripheral”. the resultant gih is displayed in table  <dig> 

primary: > <dig> connections in goi network ; secondary: 5– <dig> connections in goi network;

peripheral: < <dig> connections in goi network; orphan: no connections in goi network;

discussion
in this study, we used microarray technology to examine cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with secondary brain injury following tbi. our findings indicated that the inflammatory response and its associated genes and pathways are significant in the post-tbi molecular response. this is consistent with our published studies indicating that inflammation is involved with delayed, secondary neuronal injury following other acute brain injuries  including stroke and neurotoxin exposure  <cit> . activated microglia, astrocytes and macrophages have been shown to be the source of several of the inflammatory molecules identified in this study  <cit> . the presence of activated inflammatory cells ipsilaterally and their absence contralaterally was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. this cellular inflammation offers further evidence for pro-inflammatory molecules being produced in the region of tissue damage following tbi.

despite the absence of activated inflammatory cells on the contralateral side of the brain, our results also showed that tbi resulted in a significant alteration of the inflammatory gene response on the both sides of the brain. the observed ir gene expression pattern suggests that there is a baseline ir throughout the whole brain due to unilateral cci. this is demonstrated by the nearly 30% of all ir genes that change similarly on both sides of the brain . above this baseline of inflammation, a distinct ir gene expression pattern emerges. the expression level is higher on the ipsilateral side for all the remaining genes expressed on both sides of the brain. 95% of the ir genes expressed only in ipsilateral tissues increase in expression while 74% of the ir genes expressed only in contralateral tissues decrease in expression. examination of the contralateral gene expression in our gih showed that  <dig> genes  decreased in expression contralaterally while either remaining unchanged or increasing in expression ipsilaterally. only  <dig> genes  increased contralaterally and remained unchanged ipsilaterally. this demonstrated that the most significant contralateral ir genes in this analysis show decreased expression.

taken together with the cellular inflammation data, we can surmise that increased expression of the majority of ir genes ipsilaterally results in the development of functional inflammation that can contribute to secondary neural injury. similarly, it is likely that the suppression of the majority of ir genes contralaterally prevents this development in brain regions remote to the injury. this summary of the overall ir gene expression does not take into account that some ir genes may be classified as anti-inflammatory in certain contexts. however, any counter effects of anti-inflammatory molecules seems to be negligible as the cellular inflammation pattern follows the ir gene expression pattern assuming the majority of ir genes are pro-inflammatory. the contralateral inflammatory response without detectable cellular inflammation also fits well with the idea that some inflammation may actually be beneficial following tbi  <cit> .

through canonical pathway and network analysis combined with identification of the common genes that change differently on each side of the brain, we identified  <dig> goi. many of these genes have been previously associated with the ir following abi’s  including ccl13/ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cdkn1a, cebpb, cebpd, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  csf <dig>  fos, hbegf, hspa1a/hspa1b, icam <dig>  ier <dig>  il-1β, irf <dig>  irf <dig>  jak <dig>  lcn <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  myd <dig>  nf-κb, psmb <dig>  s100a <dig>  spp <dig>  stat <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tnfrsf1a  <cit> . these results support the utility of our methods for identifying the significant genes related to this biological function. additionally, several ir genes that appear to be novel in the context of tbi were also identified, providing new targets for future study. these genes included hsp90aa <dig>  erap <dig>  psmb <dig>  cbl, btk, rora, thra, and itga <dig>  we wanted to take our analysis one step further and determine which genes were likely the most critical in the observed ir. we accomplished this by creating a network of these genes and determining how many 1st order connections each gene had with the other genes in the network. a gih was created based on these numbers and there were some intriguing findings in terms of which tier certain molecule types predominated.

not surprisingly, a large number of transcription regulators were included in the primary and secondary tiers as these molecules are the point of convergence for many of the inflammatory pathways and the regulatory step in the production of new proteins. somewhat surprising was the large number of cytokines that fell into the peripheral tier since considerable focus has been placed on cytokines as mediators of inflammation and targets for therapeutic intervention  <cit> . this result may be due to a near 1-to- <dig> relationship that these cytokines have with their receptors, limiting the 1st order connections in the goi network. while cytokines clearly play an important role in initiating the ir, they may not be the most critical molecules in modulating the ir. only one cytokine, il1b, is in the primary tier of our hierarchy while ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and spp <dig> are in the secondary tier. this suggests that neuroprotective strategies directed at one of the lower tier cytokines may not be sufficient for limiting the ir  <cit> . further, while therapeutic hypothermia after tbi has been shown to improve outcome, inflammatory cytokine levels were unaffected, implying minimal cytokine involvement in the observed neuroprotection  <cit> . however, targeting the cytokines in the higher tiers may produce effective modification of the ir  <cit> . our gih shows that regulation of transcription, phosphorylation , extracellular matrix/cell adhesion , and receptors  figure prominently  in the post-tbi ir. these molecules may, therefore, be more efficient targets for therapeutic strategies to combat post-tbi inflammation because they are activated regardless of the initiating factor.

two well characterized signaling pathways stood out in our gih: toll-like receptor/nf-κb signaling and jak/stat signaling. there was some concern that our choice of canonical pathway may have skewed our analysis towards these signaling pathways  because large portions of both of these pathways are included in il- <dig> signaling . while  <dig> goi are included in that pathway,  <dig> of these genes were also identified by other analyses used to identify goi, further supporting their importance to the post-tbi ir. additionally, interconnection of the genes in il- <dig> signaling could not account for the total number of 1st order connections for these genes in the goi network used to build the gih. this was especially true for genes in the primary tier.  <dig> goi were either a part of , a product of , or associated with  toll-like receptor/nf-κb signaling  <cit> .  <dig> of these genes were in the primary tier of the gih. secondarily,  <dig> goi  were a part of jak/stat signaling  <cit> , and three of these genes were in the primary tier. based on our analysis, these signaling pathways are likely candidates for the induction of post-tbi ir. therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at the molecules in these pathways may reduce tbi-induced inflammation and, by extension, post-tbi neuronal death.

it should be noted that this study only takes a snapshot at 24 hours post-injury of a dynamic and evolving molecular process initiated by tbi  <cit> . therefore, significant molecular events that precede and follow this time point are not reflected in these data. for a more complete examination of the molecular response to tbi, a study including multiple time points before and after 24 hours will be necessary and are underway in our laboratory. further, confirmation of the biological relevance of any observed gene expression profile following tbi is a critical next step to exploring potential therapies for brain trauma  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
microarray analysis is a powerful tool that allows for the analysis of thousands of genes simultaneously. we demonstrated that tbi was associated with a powerful pro-inflammatory response in ipsilateral brain tissues. we also noted the distinct ir gene expression pattern that suggests a remote anti-inflammatory response. the use of multiple network and pathway analyses to identify goi aided in making our datasets manageable and revealed  <dig> distinct pathways, toll-like receptor/nf-κb signaling and jak/stat signaling, associated with post-tbi secondary neural injury. our gih provides a starting point for investigating therapeutic targets in a ranked order that is somewhat different than what has been presented previously in microarray studies. in addition to being a vehicle for identifying potential targets for post-tbi therapeutic strategies, our gih can also provide a context for evaluating the potential of therapeutic agents currently in development.
