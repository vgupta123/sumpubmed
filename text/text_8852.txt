BACKGROUND
apoptosis or programmed cell death features stereotypical morphological changes such as shrinking of cell, cell deformation, condensation of chromatin and finally cell fragmentation into apoptotic bodies. these changes are the consequences of several biochemical and molecular events occurring within the cell  <cit> . such events are executed and regulated by various molecules within the animal cell  <cit> . one such regulator, dad <dig>  was identified and proved to be interacting with mcl <dig>  providing a new perspective on its putative role in apoptosis. the dad <dig> gene was originally isolated during complementation studies of a mutant hamster cell line undergoing apoptosis upon incubation at non-permissive temperatures. further, these tsbn <dig> cells could be rescued at the non-permissive temperature upon transfection with the dad <dig> wild-type gene  <cit> .

involvement of dad <dig> in regulation of apoptosis or apoptosis related pathways have since been widely reported. dad <dig> was reported to be involved during development of c. elegans embryos  <cit>  and bombyx mori  <cit> . involvement of dad <dig> in temperature induced apoptotic cell death was reported in araneus ventricosus and argopecten irradians  <cit> . in the plant kingdom, the role of dad <dig> homologues has been reported in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , pea  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . differential regulation of dad <dig> gene was observed in flower petals during the senescence phase  <cit> . results of these investigations indicated the important role played by dad <dig> in apoptosis and development in both animal and plant systems. up-regulation of dad1-like anti-apoptotic genes was speculated in insect pests upon stress encountered due to plant defense molecules  <cit> . interestingly, dad <dig> homologue was up-regulated in one such insect pest, hessian fly , feeding on resistant wheat , suggesting its role in inhibition of unwanted apoptosis triggered due to the defense response of the host  <cit> . as observed in the hessian fly-wheat interaction, the asian rice gall midge  infestation in rice is known to induce a similar type of defense response. however, no reports on the role of any anti-apoptotic genes in the rice-gall midge interaction are available.

the asian rice gall midge is the third major insect pest of rice. estimated economic loss incurred upon gall midge attack amounts to $ <dig> million in india alone  <cit> . more recently, as a result of extensive research towards understanding the galling interaction  and with the availability of vast amounts of sequence data  <cit> , rice-gall midge is emerging as a useful model system for understanding the molecular and physiological events that enable insects to overcome the host defense machinery. the gall midge-rice interaction is either compatible or incompatible  <cit> . during compatible interaction, the gall midge manipulates the host to survive and induces gall formation; whereas during incompatible interaction the host defense overcomes the strategies adopted by the insect leading to the mortality of the gall midge. incompatible interaction can be classified into two types: hr+ and hr-. hr+ type interaction is manifested by a hypersensitive response and cell death in the plant at the region of entry of the gall midge maggots whereas hr-type interaction is non-hypersensitive mediated defense response. inability of the insect maggots to feed due to production of plant allelochemicals/defense molecules results in the death of the maggots in an incompatible interaction and the maggots usually die within 96 h post egg hatching  <cit> .

various studies have described the hypersensitive mechanism in the host plants  <cit> . however, there are few studies that investigated and compared the response of the insect during hypersensitive incompatible or compatible interaction. this work was initiated with the hypothesis that the maggots feeding on resistant rice plants encounter greater stress-induced challenge when compared to maggots feeding on susceptible rice plants. this stress encountered by the insect in the resistant host, generated by the plant defense molecules  <cit>  and the inability to feed thereafter, leads to initiation of apoptosis within the insect. in order to survive, the likely survival mechanism in the insect would be the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes  <cit> . dad <dig> is an important apoptotic suppressor gene and till date there has been no report on dad1-like genes from the asian rice gall midge. also, it is still unclear, if secretions from the gall midge feeding on the rice pant trigger apoptosis in the host plant or not. therefore, we deemed it pertinent to clone, characterize and express dad <dig> from the gall midge and evaluate its role in the insect and corresponding host responses, if any.

the current study describes characterization of dad <dig> from the asian rice gall midge and its transcriptional expression patterns in the insect during compatible and incompatible interactions with its host. orseolia oryzae dad <dig>  was isolated from a cdna library generated from maggots feeding on susceptible and resistant host varieties  <cit> . transcriptional over-expression of oodad <dig> observed in maggots during compatible and incompatible interactions suggested its role in regulation of unwanted apoptosis. in addition, this study for the first time demonstrated that the host plant recognizes dad <dig> from the insect, leading to the induction of a hypersensitive mediated response. results of the present investigation revealed the important role played by dad <dig> in insect-plant interaction.

RESULTS
characterization of oodad1
the full-length cdna of oodad <dig> consisted of  <dig> nucleotide bases  coding for  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the cdna clone was designated oodad <dig> and the genomic sequence was designated goodad <dig> . the latter consisted of one intron of 85 bp and two exons of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides.

the estimated pi of the predicted protein oodad <dig> was found to be  <dig> . there were eight non-polar and seven polar amino acid residues. the instability index, as computed by expasy-protparam tool, was  <dig>  that classified the protein as a stable protein. topcons predicted oodad1 to possess three trans-membrane helices . bioinformatics analysis using smart predicted the absence of a secretory signal sequence in the predicted protein while topcons confirmed that the protein was likely to be localized to membranes. maximum homology of the deduced amino acid sequence was observed with dad <dig> from mayetiola destructor  dad <dig> followed by dad1 from anopheles gambiae . secondary structure prediction tool, robetta, predicted  <dig> probable structures for oodad <dig> . of all the predicted models the fifth model was found to have lowest score  and the maximum stability. oodad <dig> was predicted to possess four large alpha-helices, as reported in mdesdad <dig>  with no beta strands across the entire deduced protein sequence.

a multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of dad <dig>  from different insects with oodad <dig> revealed several homologous domains and conserved regions. results indicated that the protein was highly conserved at the c-terminal region as compared to the n-terminus. the highest degree of homology  was  <dig>  % in case of mayetiola destructor .fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of oodad <dig> with its orthologues from blood-feeding, sap-sucking and phytophagous insects. black line indicates the variable n-terminal region of the proteins compared. shaded boxes highlight conserved domains. accession numbers are in parenthesis. conserved amino acid residues are shown below the shaded boxes



phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic analysis of oodad <dig> revealed the degree of relationship of oodad <dig> with respect to those from other organisms . however, this study clearly classified dad <dig> of plant and animal taxa into two large clades. the clade containing dad <dig> from animals were further sub-divided into vertebrates and invertebrates. the dipterans were clustered in a sub-clade under the invertebrates group. oodad <dig> was grouped within the clade containing other insects belonging to the order diptera. the tree also revealed close relationship of oodad <dig> with orthologues from the hessian fly  and aphid  both of which are also plant feeders.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree showing relationship between orthologues of dad <dig> reported from different organisms. the tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method and the pair-wise distances were calculated using the poisson-corrected distance method included in the macvector suite of programs. branch lengths are arbitrary. this tree was arrived at using  <dig> replications and figures at nodes represent detected bootstrap values above 50 %. accession numbers are in parenthesis



southern analysis
southern hybridization, using a 339 bp oodad <dig> fragment as probe, revealed that oodad <dig> existed as a single copy in all the three biotypes  analysed . a single hybridization signal was observed in all the three biotypes digested with restriction enzymes ecori, ecorv and drai. further, no restriction fragment length polymorphism  was detected between these biotypes.fig.  <dig> southern analysis of genomic dnas of asian rice gall midge biotypes . the dnas were digested with ecori, ecorv and drai and probed with a 339 bp fragment of oodad <dig>  molecular mass  of the hybridization signals is indicated by figures on the left



differential expression analysis of oodad <dig> in maggots feeding on susceptible and resistant rice varieties
the transcript level of oodad <dig> was assessed in a set of compatible  and incompatible interactions  . the expression level of oodad <dig> transcripts at 24 h in maggots feeding on the susceptible  host was used as a baseline and the expression at all other time points were scored relative to this. in the interactions involving gmb <dig> with jaya  and rp <dig> , over-expression of oodad <dig> was observed in both cases. however, the expression level in maggots feeding on jaya gradually increased by more than 3-fold at 72hai and peaked to  <dig> -fold at 96hai   in comparison to maggots feeding on jaya 24hai. however, in case of maggots feeding on rp <dig> there was sudden increase of expression level to 8-fold from 24hai  and this enhanced expression was sustained at 48hai , 72hai  and 96hai .fig.  <dig> expression of oodad <dig> in the asian rice gall midge. relative expression evaluated in midges feeding on susceptible  and resistant  rice varieties determined using quantitative real-time pcr. the time points mentioned are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96hai. rq values describe the relative expression values of transcripts with reference to expression level of oodad <dig> in maggots feeding on jaya variety . error bars represent mean ± sd



generation of recombinant oodad1
the use of pet 28a vector for protein expression resulted in the production of his-tagged oodad <dig> protein with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda,  as expected. anti-his antibodies were used to confirm the expression and the size of the protein .fig.  <dig> heterologous expression of oodad <dig> and western analysis. a coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel showing over-expression of recombinant oodad <dig> in bl <dig>  plyse escherichia coli-based expression system using pet 28a expression vector. lanes:  <dig>  lysate of induced, transformed cells with oodad1;  <dig>  supernatent of induced, transformed cells with oodad1;  <dig>  pellet of induced, transformed cells with oodad <dig>  m, protein ladder. b western analysis of polyacrylamide gel shown in  and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-his tag antibodies . lane designation is same as in . arrows indicate the location of the his-tagged oodad <dig>  numbers on the left represent molecular weights in kilodaltons 



plant assay and dab  staining
the purified oodad <dig> protein , the protein elution buffer and water injection into the host variety rp <dig>  initiated hr. however, the observed spread of hr in rp <dig>  was more in plants injected with oodad <dig> when compared with the plants injected with buffer and bsa. however, no hr was observed in jaya plants after injection . the injection region of the plants when stained with dab showed brown coloration in suraksha after 48 h post injection and after 72 h post injection in rp <dig> . dab staining produces brown coloration in tissues having increased peroxidase activity  and is used as a marker for hypersensitivity in plants.fig.  <dig> hr response of gall midge resistant rice injected with recombinant oodad <dig>  plant injection assay showing induction of hr response in the gall midge resistant rice variety, rp <dig>  upon injection with recombinant oodad <dig>  rp <dig> injected with a purified protein; b protein elution buffer; c bsa dissolved in protein elution buffer. black dots indicate the markings made prior to injection for easy localization of injected regions

discussion
for a better understanding of the molecular basis of insect-plant interaction, studying the defense response initiated by the avirulent maggots, feeding on a resistant host, is equally important as gaining insight into the mechanism of infestation of virulent maggots. initiation of hypersensitive response as a result of apoptosis in the plants has been well documented in case of plant-microbe interaction  <cit> . however, other than the study on hessian fly-wheat interaction, there are no additional reports that delve into the modulation of genes related to apoptosis in the insect during its interaction with the host plant  <cit> .

the current study indicated that oodad <dig> is transcriptionally modulated in the pest depending on whether it is feeding on a susceptible or resistant host. in addition, this is the first report of the heterologous expression of a dad <dig> from an insect which when injected into resistant rice hosts induced a hypersensitive response.

blast and phylogenetic analyses not only showed high homology between dad <dig> orthologues of insects and oodad <dig> but also a high degree of conservation of the predicted amino acid residues of oodad <dig> with those reported for dad <dig> from other species including plants and vertebrates. such a high degree of conservation is likely indicative of an important functional role played by dad <dig> in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. earlier reports confirm dad <dig> to be a member of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex responsible for n-linked glycosylation  <cit> . it has also been observed that the c-terminal amino acid residues, which are known to be crucial for n-terminal glycosylation function  <cit> , are conserved in dad <dig> from a wide range of organisms.

however, despite a high degree of homology between dad <dig> from different organisms, a few dissimilar amino acid residues amongst the proteins provide each with specific signatures that can be used to classify dad <dig> of different organisms corresponding with their evolutionary relationship. moreover, these specific signatures are capable of differentiating dad <dig> of plants from those in the animal kingdom. in addition, these signatures also differentiate dad <dig> from invertebrates and vertebrates and also those from phytophagous and haematophagous dipterans.

dad <dig> has been shown to play an important role as a suppressor of the apoptotic pathway in many organisms  <cit> . hence, the differential expression pattern of oodad <dig> in maggots feeding on susceptible and resistant hosts is likely indicative of its important role in the apoptotic pathway in the rice gall midge too. while controlled apoptosis is induced in the cell during developmental stages, apoptosis can also occur when cell is under stress  <cit> . in the case of gall midge-rice compatible interaction, the midge undergoes its normal life cycle. on susceptible plants, maggots establish a feeding site between  <dig> and  <dig> hai and genes involved in growth and development are up-regulated, as also observed in the hessian fly-wheat interaction . and therefore, the minor increase in the oodad <dig> transcript observed in maggots feeding on susceptible host during  <dig> to 96hai as compared to 24hai could be a part of normal homeostasis and development  <cit>  of maggots.

however, on the resistant plants, the transcript levels of oodad <dig> registered an instant increase and these levels were sustained till 96hai. in previous studies involving hessian fly-wheat interactions, it was observed that hessian fly maggots failed to establish a feeding site on resistant wheat varieties, and as a result stress responsive genes and those involved in disruption of homeostasis were up-regulated  <cit> . further, it is likely that on resistant hosts the maggots face nutritional stress owing to its inability to maintain feeding, probably due to toxic plant compounds and/or feeding deterrents, and as a result face starvation and eventual death. this could result in a cascade of events connected with the defense pathways of which one could be over-expression of dad <dig> to prevent it from succumbing to stress-induced apoptosis.

interestingly, results from the plant injection assays, using recombinant oodad <dig>  showed increased hr in gall midge resistant rice hosts which contradicts the reported role of dad <dig>  a plausible explanation for the observed results could be the presence of certain motifs in the insect-derived dad <dig> that the gall midge resistant host recognizes and as a result initiates the hypersensitive reaction against the foreign protein. this is also supported by data from the phylogenetic analysis that clearly differentiates dad <dig> of plant and animal origin. moreover, it has also been suggested that dad <dig>  of one organism may not proceed with the conserved mechanism of pcd signaling pathway in another organism  <cit> . furthermore, staining of rice tissues with dab, after injection of recombinant oodad <dig>  showed increased hr in suraksha at 48hai while in rp <dig> it was observed at 72hai. this may be due to inherent genotypic differences in the two resistant rice varieties. our earlier studies have also shown that these two resistant rice varieties carry gall midge resistance genes gm <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively. though both rice varieties behave differently upon gall midge attack the final outcome in both cases is mortality of the maggots  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the experiments described here show the crucial role played by oodad <dig> in gall midge-rice interaction. oodad <dig> is transcriptionally up-regulated in maggots, feeding on resistant host, in an attempt to overcome the challenge faced by the maggots in the resistant host. in addition, plant assays involving recombinant oodad <dig> suggested that the insect protein is detected by the resistant host resulting in hr. however, more detailed studies would be required for further unraveling the role played by oodad <dig> in the gall midge-rice interaction. in addition, rnai-based studies in conjunction with studies on oodad <dig> mutants would help in understanding the role of dad <dig> in insect-plant interaction in general and gall midge-rice interaction in particular. besides, immuno-localization studies with oodad <dig> would help in furthering our understanding of the molecular events during insect-plant interactions.
