BACKGROUND
transcriptional regula tion is one of the crucial mechanisms used by living systems to maintain homeostasis. disregulation of gene expression underlies toxic effects of many chemicals  <cit> , and gene expression changes are often reliable markers of a disease  <cit> . the specificity of transcriptional initiation of a eukaryotic gene is maintained through a complex interaction of one or more sequence-specific transcription factors, regulatory dna regions harboring corresponding dna regulatory motifs, chromatin-remodeling proteins and the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> . while not all modes of expression regulatory controls are known, it has been shown that in many important biological processes the initiation of transcription requires binding of one or more transcriptional factors to their cognate regulatory motifs within regulatory dna regions. two key high-throughput  experimental technologies are capable of producing data offering insights into the expression regulatory mechanism on a genome scale. the first technology are expression microarrays facilitating simultaneous monitoring expression of virtually all genes in a genome  <cit> . the second technology is the chromatin immuno-precipitation on chip  technology facilitating assessment of transcription factor binding events on a genomic scale  <cit> . optimal joint modeling of data generated by these two complementary biological assays, with the goal of identifying and characterizing tms, is an important open problem in computational biomedicine.

earliest applications of microarray technology included attempts at discovering shared regulatory motifs and corresponding transcription factors within groups of co-expressed genes identified by cluster analysis  <cit> . groups of co-expressed genes were first identified by clustering gene expression profiles. putative regulatory motifs inducing the co-expression were then identified de-novo using the meme algorithm  <cit> . the inefficiency of procedures in which different data-types  are analyzed separately is due to the inability of patterns in different data-types to re-enforce each other. for example, due to the noise in microarray data, the correlation between expression levels of two co-regulated genes could be too weak to be detected by clustering expression data alone. however, if evidence exists that promoters of these two genes are bound by the same tf, this information could enforce the weak signal in the expression data and allow us to identify these two genes as being parts of the same tm. in the traditional two-step approach such co-regulation will be lost since the second step regulatory motif analysis is conditional on co-expression of the two genes.

several heuristic algorithms have been developed for constructing tms by integrated analysis of gene expression and binding  data. genetic regulatory modules  algorithm  <cit>  uses binding data to identify a gene set bound to common tfs . it then searches for other genes at a lower level of significance  that are bound by those tfs and have similar expression levels to the initial gene set core . remodiscovery  <cit>  follows similar stringent and relaxed two step procedures and infers tms from chip-chip, motif and expression data. module finding algorithm  also uses two level p-values, but additional criteria for selecting genes regulated by a specific tf is the correlation between expression levels of such genes and expression level of the tf  <cit> . statistical-algorithmic method for bicluster analysis  algorithm  <cit>  transforms expression and binding data items to properties of genes/genes or genes/proteins, then generates a genes-properties bipartite graph. the algorithm aims at discovering sets of genes with statistically significant common properties. samba requires discretization of inherently continuous gene expression and binding data based on more or less ad-hoc cut-offs which will almost certainly reduce the information content of the data.

in a model-based approach to find tms based on gene expression and tf binding data, one postulates the probabilistic model of all data and then estimates parameters of the model which define tm membership. three such models based on bayesian networks have been proposed. in the first approach  <cit>  both gene expression and chip-chip data are directly modeled within the same bayesian hierarchical model. in the other model, chip-chip data is used to calculate prior probabilities of tm memberships  <cit>  based on an extension of the bayesian module networks model  <cit> . in both of these models, the number of the modules has to be first be estimated from the data  and all inference is valid conditional on the number of modules being correct. since both of these models can also be thought of as extensions of the basic finite-mixture model, it is very likely that they will share inherent instability with respect to misspecification of the "correct" number of modules  <cit> . earlier, a bayesian casual network inferred from discretized expression data was used to describe the gene regulatory network with the binding data used to establish the constraints for the network structure  <cit> . the number of genes participating in the network construction is limited because of the complexity of model search. cogrim  <cit>  algorithm uses a bayesian hierarchical framework to fit a gene-by-gene linear regression model of a gene's expression levels as function of is a quadratic function of all tfs' expression levels and their pair-wise interactions. the chip-chip binding data and the tf binding motif scores based on predefined position weight matrices  are integrated as the prior information in the model. genes are grouped into same tms if they are regulated by the same set of tfs.

we developed a novel expression-chip infinite mixture  model for identifying tms by jointly modeling gene expression and tf binding data. the model is constructed by extending the context-specific infinite mixture model   <cit>  in such a way that expression and binding data are represented by two separate contexts with different probabilistic models. we also constructed a novel probabilistic representation for the chip-chip data that seems to capture all relevant information from this data and use it within the binding-context of the model. the overall approach makes use of the bayesian infinite mixture framework  <cit>  to circumvent the issue of identifying the 'correct' number of global and local patterns in the data. context-specificity not only allows the use of different probabilistic models to represent expression and binding data, but it also allows for discordances between patterns of co-expression and co-regulation. posterior distribution of model parameters is estimated using gibbs sampling  <cit> . tms are formed based on posterior pairwise probabilities  of co-membership and posterior binding probabilities . it has been previously shown that ppps can be directly interpreted as measures of statistical significance of co-membership  <cit> .

the new computational procedure can be used in more or less the same way as one would use simple hierarchical clustering without need to perform any special transformation of data prior to the analysis. in the results section we show that pbps are able to identify binding relationships not revealed by chip-chip binding data alone. we demonstrate the ability of this procedure to integrate information from gene expression and tf binding data by assessing the functional coherence of tms constructed from real-world datasets.

RESULTS
data preparation
we constructed four expression-binding datasets to examine the performance of ecim and alternative methods. for each dataset, binding data consisted of chip-chip data assessing binding affinities for  <dig> tfs to promoters of  <dig> genes  <cit> . expression datasets we used were the sporulation data set consisting of gene expression measurements throughout the sporulation process for the yeast strain sk <dig>  <cit> ; the sporulation data set consisting of gene expression measurements during sporulation for the yeast strains sk <dig> and w303y  <cit> ; the cell cycle data set consisting of gene expression measurements spanning two complete yeast cell cycles  <cit> ; and the combined sporulation-cell cycle dataset which we previously used to validate the csimm model  <cit> . dual channel data  <cit>  was processed by:  adjusting for background signal intensities;  calculating log-intensity ratios of intensities in two channels;  adjusting log-ratios using local regression of log-ratios on average log-intensities in two channels; and  centering each gene's log-ratios by subtracting the gene-specific average log-ratio. affymetrix data  <cit>  was processed by:  setting any measurement below one to one;  log-transforming measurements; and  centering each gene's log-measurements by subtracting the gene-specific average log-measurement. genes with the maximum signal strength of less than  <dig> were excluded from the analysis. to make results comparable across different datasets, we used only data for genes represented on all microarray platforms .

sensitivity and specificity of co-memembership in tms
using the gibbs sampler, we generated a sequence of tms approximating the marginal posterior distribution of tms given data. this distribution was summarized by calculating ppps of two genes belonging to the same tm, and pbp of a specific tf binding to the promoter of a specific gene. for each dataset we constructed an expression-chip infinite mixture  based hierarchical clustering of genes using ppps as the similarity measure with the average-linkage principle. the precision of such analysis was compared to results obtained by using alternative analytical approaches and by using the equivalent models with only expression or only binding data. following are descriptions of all methods compared:

ecim expression and binding
hierarchical clustering based on ppps derived from ecim analysis of both expression and binding data.

ecim expression
hierarchical clustering based on ppps derived from ecim analysis of expression data.

ecim binding
hierarchical clustering based on ppps derived from ecim analysis of binding data.

binding p-values
tm's formed based on p-values of binding calculated in the original publication <cit> .

binding pbp
tms formed based on pbps from ecim analysis of expression and binding data.

euclidian distance
hierarchical clustering based on euclidian distances of expression data.

gram
tms formed using the gram algorithm with default parameters, expression and binding data.

samba
tms formed using the samba algorithm with default parameters and expression data only.

roc curves were constructed by correlating results for the  <dig> kegg-associated genes where "functional clusters" are based on the co-membership of these  <dig> genes within any kegg  <cit>  pathway. it is obvious that this is not the perfect "gold standard" as some co-regulated genes will not be categorized to belong to a common pathway and vice versa. however, the assumption behind using membership in specific pathways as a gold standard, which is that co-regulated genes are more likely to participate in the same pathway than randomly grouped genes, is reasonable. other well-known annotation databases, such as go  <cit>  or mips  <cit> , are more complicated to use since they are hierarchically structured and results would depend on the level of specificity used to construct functional grouping.

roc for hierarchical tms based on hierarchical clustering using ppps and euclidian distance
the tree was cut at different depths to create clustering with every possible number of clusters. for a fixed number of clusters a pair of genes  belonging to the same cluster was assumed to be a "true positive" if the two genes both belonged to at least one specific kegg pathway, and it was considered to be a "false positive" if they did not share a single kegg pathway. true and false positive rates were then obtained by dividing the number of true/false positives with the total number of gene pairs sharing a common kegg pathway and total number of gene pairs not sharing a kegg pathway respectively. when the number of clusters is equal to the number of genes and all genes are placed in their own individual clusters, both true and false positive rates are equal to zero. a roc curve is defined when we reduce the number of clusters and both true and false positive rates increase. at the extreme when all genes are placed in the same cluster, both true and false positive rates are equal to one.

roc curves for ecims based on binding p-values and pbp
the significance cut-off was varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  for each cut-off level, two genes were considered to be co-regulated if they were bound by at least one common tf at this significance level. true and false positive rates were established in the same way as for the clusters formed by hierarchical clustering with kegg "gold standard".

gram and samba
true and false positive rates for tms produced by the two algorithms with default parameters were calculated in the same way as for the previous two situations. there was no recommended way to vary specificity and sensitivity of these two algorithms so we report only a single true and false positive rate for each algorithm.

since just 5% of gene-pairs annotated in kegg shared the same pathway, only when the true positive rate  is at least  <dig> times higher than the false positive rate  do true positive pairs outnumber the false positives. therefore we only show roc curves for each dataset/method combination for statistically relevant false-positive rates . the fprs achieved by gram and samba are around or less than  <dig> , thus we plotted left most part of roc curves  to make a clear comparison . roc curves on the expended rage of fprs  are shown figure  <dig> 

ecim-derived tms based on the expression and binding data clearly outperformed all other approaches. in all three datasets, ecim framework was able to successfully integrate information from both data types and significantly improve precision of analysis over individually analyzing any one of two data types. when using only binding data, it made no difference whether we simply use p-values to construct modules or apply ecim procedure using only the binding data context, which was expected since the binding data was the only information source even we use different processing methods. on the other hand, tms constructed by either hierarchically clustering genes using ppps or using pbps derived from the same analysis, were equally precise. this suggests that either ppp or pbp summarizes the posterior distribution of tms generated by the ecim analysis of two data types and carries all the meaningful information about the underlying tm structure.

to demonstrate the seamless integration of ecim framework with more sophisticated expression data models we re-analyzed the combined sporulation-cellcycle data set we previously described  <cit>  using csimm model for multiple expression data contexts . as expected, the ecim with csimm expression data contexts outperformed all other approaches, indicating the ability of the csimm model to effectively integrate information from different expression data sets and the ability of the ecim model to integrate further such complex expression data with chip-chip binding data.

the performance of two previously described computational procedures for constructing tms based on joint analysis of expression and binding data was relatively poor. points defined by single pairs of true/false positive rates for both methods with default parameters fall below all roc curves including the one that uses only binding p-values. for the combined sporulation-cellcycle dataset we manipulated the parameters for the two algorithm with the goal of obtaining roc points for a range of false positive rates. detailed tables of parameters used and resulting fprs and tprs are shown in supplemental tables  <dig> and  <dig>  . roc points obtained by these two algorithms with non-default parameters are depicted by smaller dots in figures  <dig> and 3d. while we managed to expand the range of fprs, the overall conclusions did not change.

in the case of samba we used only expression data because we could not establish with certainty the appropriate transformation for the binding data used in the original study  <cit> . this is appropriate because the statistical procedure implemented in samba is same for both the gene expression and appropriately transformed chip-chip data. furthermore, samba has been originally described in the context of clustering gene expression data alone and the web page manual describes only this kind of use. however, it is important to emphasize that samba's performance should be compared to results of other procedures that use only gene expression data . given the poor precision of tms generated by samba when compared to ecim using only expression data, we conjecture that adding binding data is unlikely to improve samba's results to the point of performing better than ecim using both data types. for the sporulation data in figure 1a both samba and gram failed to identify any tms. same was the case for gram with cell-cycle data in figure 1c.

in the original publications, both samba and gram were used to analyze larger expression datasets than we used here. to assess the scalability of results presented here we also analyzed a significantly larger dataset with  <dig> microarray experiments assessing yeast transcriptional responses to various environmental perturbations  <cit> . the functional coherence of produced tms was also compared to the functional coherence of tms previously constructed using a large scale gene expression data analysis  <cit>  for  <dig> different cut levels provided by authors, and two latest algorithms   <cit>  for constructing tms from jointly analyzing gene expression data, chip-chip data and dna motif scores obtained by scanning gene promoters using predefined pwm. the comparisons to remodiscovery and cogrim were based on results published in original publications describing these two algorithms. these results were based on analyzing the gene expression datasets that contained the gasch dataset  <cit> , and on the same tf binding dataset we used in our analyses . we downloaded module definitions from the respective support web sites and constructed roc points using again kegg pathways as the gold standard. for remodiscovery we used two modules definitions discussed in the paper . for cogrim we used two modules defined by authors  and the combined module corresponding to all modules constructed by cogrim. unfortunately, after multiple attempts we were not able to construct tms using samba on this dataset. this could be a consequence of the large number of missing values in this dataset or our inability to correctly format missing values. we again manipulated gram parameters  to expand the range of false positive rates.

basic conclusion still held and all algorithms we tested produced improved roc results when compared to the smaller expression datasets . however, although ecim performed as well or better than any other algorithm, significant improvements in precision from adding chip-chip data were visible only when pbp's are used to construct the modules. this could be the consequence of the additional noise in the algorithm for constructing hierarchical clustering from ppps. ecim also outperformed tms constructed by the large gene expression datasets alone  <cit>  as well as two algorithms that use expression, binding and dna sequence motif information to infer tms  <cit>  despite the dramatically smaller number of data points used in the analysis. cogrim outperformed gram and matched the functional coherence of modules that were based on a much larger gene expression dataset alone. this could be due to the additional regulation information used in the analysis or simply due to the more efficient use of the expression data alone.

finally, we performed additional comparisons between tms produced by gram and ecim using gene ontologies as the gold standard  <cit> . in this comparison, we constructed tms by cutting the hierarchical tree constructed by the ecim algorithm so that the total number of genes in resulting tms was about the same as the number of genes implicated by gram . for each gene-pair we identify the most specific go category to which both of them belong by defining the specificity as i =  where s is the number of genes annotated in this go item and n is the total number of genes annotated in go. it has been shown that such a measure of specificity is a good way to represent the level of information about functional relationship between genes based on go groupings  <cit> . for a specific cut-off i, a pair of genes is true positive if the corresponding i>i and are placed in at least one common tm. a pair of genes is false positive if i>i, but the two genes do not share a commong tm. roc curves in figure  <dig> are constructed by systematically changing the threshold i and calculating corresponding true and false positive rates for tms constructed by gram and those constructed by ecim. results of this analysis are concordant with results obtained by using kegg pathways as the gold standard.

in addition to constructing roc curves we examined the coherence of tms identified in this analysis in terms of statistical significances of over-represented gene ontologies. for each tm, we identified the most over-represented gene ontology as measured by the p-value of the fisher's exact test. the distribution of tm sizes and the statistical significances of most over-represented gene ontologies is depicted in figure  <dig>  assuming that the false discovery rate of  <dig>  to be statistically significant, the results of the analysis are summarized in table  <dig>  overall, the higher proportion of tms constructed by ecim  were statistically significantly associated with at least on gene ontology. the number of genes in statistically significant tms constructed by ecim was more than twice the number of genes in statistically significant tms constructed by gram.

the comparison of gene ontologies significantly associated with tms constructed by ecim and gram  reveals that several key gene ontologies were implicated by both algorithms . on the other hand,  <dig> out of  <dig> ecim modules and  <dig> out  <dig> gram modules were algorithm specific. all of these  <dig> algorithm specific categories could be linked in one way or another to the two basic process investigated by expression data . consequently, it seems that both algorithms are identifying relevant tms, it is just that ecim is assigning a greater number relevant genes to these tms. the list of all tms along with the associated gene ontologies is given in the supplemental table  <dig>  .

constructing tm's and identification of associated regulators
to demonstrate the simplicity of use and interpretation of ecim results we constructed tms based on results of the combined sporulation-cell cycle dataset.  <dig> genes were selected based on the fact that their average linkage distance based on ecim-derived ppps to at least one other gene or group of genes was below  <dig>  and their cluster size is larger than  <dig>  previously we demonstrated that such average linkage distance cut-offs have direct interpretations in terms of statistical significance of implicated associations  <cit> . the heatmap in figure  <dig> depicts clusters of co-regulated genes and their associated tfs as well as the strength of this association based on pbps. on the right hand side of the heat-map, are gene ontologies most significantly associated with each tm. all tfs associated with different tm's  are identified based on either the high pbps between individual genes and individual tfs, or by over-representation of genes with statistically significant binding p-values  for a tf in the chip-chip experiment . descriptions of resulting tms are given in the supplementary table  <dig>  . the biological meaning of identified tms is discussed in the next section.

we also investigate the utility of pbps in identifying novel regulatory relationships not implicated by chip-chip data alone. we used experimentally verified binding site lists from transfac  <cit>  consisting of  <dig> binding sites involving  <dig> genes and  <dig> tfs as our gold-standard. among all gene/tf pairs with binding p-values less than  <dig> , 35% are verified in transfac. the threshold  <dig>  was carefully selected to balance the specificity and sensitivity of binding between all tfs and gene promoters  <cit> . we selected  <dig> gene/tf pairs  with highest pbps among all  <dig>  pairs in transfac. none of the  <dig> pairs had binding p-values less than  <dig> . however,  <dig> of the  <dig> gene/tf pairs  are listed in transfac. the accuracy rate  is almost same as binding p-value's, which suggests that pbp is able to identify novel regulation information. another two gene/protein pairs  are very good candidates for further investigation. spr3's promoter region has sum1's putative binding site mse and its transcription is increased with the presence of sum <dig>  <cit> , opi3's promoter region has ino4's putative binding site uasino element, its transcription is depressed with the presence of ino <dig> <cit> .

description of transcriptional modules detected
sporulation
clusters associated with the biological processes of synapsis/recombination and spore wall assembly were clearly discerned in the primig sporulation dataset . genes within each of the clusters for both yeast strains sk <dig> and w <dig> were all upregulated late in the sporulation process. joint data clustering showed enrichment in the number of clusters associated with sporulation as well as the number of regulators identified . in addition to modules regulated by sum <dig> and pho <dig>  the ecim algorithm identified a third transcriptional module associated with synapsis/recombination  that consisted of three additional regulators; gln <dig>  otu <dig> and rcs <dig>  gln <dig> positively regulates genes that are subject to nitrogen catabolite repression  <cit> ; under conditions of nitrogen limitation, gln <dig> localizes to the nucleus and activates ncr-sensitive genes. gln <dig> was likely detected due to the use of nitrogen-deficient sporulation media. in addition to its role as a deubiquitylation enzyme, otu <dig> has been suggested by database mining to affect pis <dig> expression, which is required for the final step in phosphatidylinositol synthesis <cit> . previous work has demonstrated that s. cerevisiae inositol auxotrophic strains require inositol for the completion of sporulation <cit> . rcs <dig> is a transcription factor involved in iron utilization and homeostasis  <cit> . previous studies have found that it is also involved in controlling cell size  <cit>  as well as biotin uptake and biosynthesis, nitrogen assimilation and purine biosynthesis <cit> . using joint data clustering, two transcriptional modules separately detected sum <dig>  sum <dig> is required for middle sporulation element-mediated repression during meiotic development in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

amino acid metabolism
a single transcriptional module involved in the biological process of amino acid metabolism was detected using expression data exclusively. this ten gene gcn4-regulated module could not be further specifically annotated. in contrast, joint data clustering identified a transcriptional module that was significantly associated with methionine biosynthesis . genes in this module were cell cycle regulated and had increased expression in the s/g <dig> transition . this "met" cluster has similarly been observed using microarrays to study s. cerevisiae cell cycle-regulated genes <cit> . in addition to gcn <dig>  the primary regulator of the transcriptional response to amino acid starvation, joint data clustering identified met <dig>  met <dig>  cbf <dig> and ino <dig> . met <dig> is responsible for the regulation of the sulfur amino acid pathway and requires different combinations of auxiliary factors including met <dig> and cbf <dig>  in the primig sporulation dataset  <cit> , genes in the cluster associated with methionine biosynthesis show a derepression early in the sporulation process prior to sporulation clusters associated with spore wall assembly. ino <dig> is required for derepression of inositol-choline-regulated genes involved in phospholipid synthesis. previous work has shown that the completion of sporulation requires inositol  <cit> .

protein biosynthesis
three clusters associated with the biological processes of rrna processing and metabolism, rna processing and ribosomal gene expression, and mitochondrial ribosomal protein metabolism were detected using expression data exclusively. however, only one transcriptional module was identified, consisting of the regulators fhl <dig>  rap <dig> and yap <dig>  this same cluster was identified using joint data clustering  and two additional regulators were identified; met <dig> and pdr <dig>  patterns identified in both sporulation and cell cycle datasets suggested that genes regulated by this module were upregulated in g1- and s-phases and/or early in sk <dig> sporulation. the forkhead-like transcription factor fhl <dig> plays a key role in the control of rrna processing  <cit> . rap <dig>  in its role as a positive regulator, activates a number of ribosomal proteins  <cit> . yap <dig> is a bzip protein, shown to be regulated at the g1/s transition  <cit> . pdr <dig> is a master drug regulator involved in the recruitment of other zinc cluster proteins to pleiotropic drug resistance elements to modulate the regulation of multidrug resistance genes  <cit> . met <dig>  also identified above in the amino acid metabolism transcriptional module category, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the sulfur amino acid pathway.

the second transcriptional module involved in the biological process of rrna processing and metabolism  was identified using joint data clustering and consisted of three additional regulators; arg <dig>  hap <dig> and rcs <dig>  patterns identified in the cho cell cycle dataset  <cit>  suggested that genes regulated by this module were upregulated in s-and g2-phases. the remodiscovery algorithm similarly identified arg <dig> associated with ribosome biogenesis  <cit> , a transcription factor involved in regulation of arginine-responsive genes. likewise, the gram algorithm identified rcs <dig> associated with protein synthesis  <cit> . rcs <dig>  also identified above in the sporulation transcriptional module category, is a transcription factor involved in a variety of different processes, including iron homeostasis, control of cell size, biotin biosynthesis, nitrogen assimilation and purine biosynthesis. hap <dig> is a subunit of the ccaat-binding factor , which activates genes required for respiratory metabolism; the hap <dig> and hap <dig> subunits of cbf are also required for optimal expression of asn <dig>  an asparagine synthase  <cit> .

cell cycle
two transcriptional modules involved in the biological processes of chromatin cohesion and dna repair and g2/m cell cycle transition were detected using expression data exclusively. joint data clustering also identified these two modules , but found several more regulators. in addition to dot <dig>  mata <dig>  mbp <dig>  mcm <dig>  ndd <dig> and swi <dig>  the csimm algorithm identified fkh <dig>  ino <dig> and swi <dig>  further, two additional transcriptional modules associated with the biological processes of late-g1-specific transcription  and cytokinesis  were detected  and included the regulators ace <dig>  ash <dig>  mbp <dig>  skn <dig>  stb <dig> and swi <dig> as well as fkh <dig>  ino <dig> and mcm <dig> 

in diploid cells, mata <dig> has been shown to interact with another homeodomain protein, matalpha <dig>  and bind dna as a heterodimer to repress transcription of haploid-specific genes  <cit> . mbp <dig> is a dna-binding protein that forms the mbf complex with swi6; mbf is a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates gene expression during the g1/s transition of the cell cycle  <cit> . in addition to mbp <dig>  swi <dig> has been shown to form the sbf complex with the dna-binding protein swi <dig> to regulate transcription at the g1/s transition  <cit> . the mbf and sbf complexes regulate late-g1-specific transcription. although skn <dig> is required for induction of heat-shock genes by oxidative stress  <cit> , it has recently been shown to associate with mbp <dig>  forming a transcription factor independent of mbf that may be involved in the bud-emergence process  <cit> . stb <dig> binds to swi <dig> and has a role in the regulation of mbp-specific transcription  <cit> . mcm <dig> has been shown to be required for the coordination of g2-specific transcription  <cit> . ndd <dig> is essential for the expression of a set of late-s-phase-specific genes  <cit> . fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> are transcription factors of the forkhead family that regulate the cell cycle  <cit> . ace <dig> has been shown to activate the expression of early-g1-specific genes  <cit> . dot <dig> is a protein of unknown function involved in telomeric silencing  <cit>  and filamentation  <cit> . ino <dig>  also identified above using joint expression and binding data clustering in the amino acid metabolism transcriptional module category, is a transcription factor that regulated genes involved in phospholipid synthesis. in diploid cells deprived of nitrogen, ash <dig> has been shown to be asymmetrically localized to the nuclei of daughter cells during pseudohyphal growth  <cit> .

finally, the transcriptional coherence of the genes in these tms and associated regulators were assessed by calculating average correlations between expression levels of genes in a tm and the expression levels of associated tfs . the statistical significance of these average correlations  was assessed by calculating p-values based on resampling-based null-distribution of average correlations. briefly, for each tm-tf pair a random set of genes of the same size as the original tm was selected from the list of all genes used in the analysis. the average correlation between the expression levels of the tf and all genes in such random set was calculated and compared to the actual average correlation for this tm-tf pair. this was repeated  <dig> times. for r> <dig>  one-sided p-value assessing the statistical significance of r was calculated as the proportion of times when r was larger than re-sampled average correlations. for r< <dig>  one-sided p-value was calculated as the proportion of times when r was smaller than re-sampled average correlations. two-sided p-values were obtained by doubling the one-sided p-values and are reported in table  <dig>  p-values that were equal to zero by this calculations were set to the smallest observable non-zero p-value .  <dig> out of  <dig> tm-tf pairs were significantly positively or negatively correlated . expected number of pairs with p-value< <dig>  under the global null hypothesis that none of the tm-tf pairs were correlated is less than  <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> tfs were positively correlated with respective tms representing putative inducers.  <dig> tm-tf pairs were negatively correlated implicated potential repressors.

in this paper we utilized the chip-chip dataset of lee et al  <cit>  instead of the newer chip-chip dataset <cit> . the reason for this was the "higher information density" in the lee dataset which has about  <dig> statistically significant binding events while the newer dataset has about 25% more binding events for twice as many transcription factors examined. however, we did perform similar analysis using the newer dataset for comparative reasons. roc curves resulting from this analysis ) and tms  were similar to the ones discussed here.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented a novel probabilistic model and related computational procedures for jointly modeling the gene expression and tf binding data within the context specific bayesian infinite mixture framework. the algorithm identifies transcriptional modules consisting of groups of co-regulated genes and tfs that regulate expression of genes within such groups. the method does not require prior knowledge of number of modules. we demonstrated the improved functional coherence of tms by analyzing real world data. we also demonstrated that novel regulatory relationship can be identified which would not be implicated by either analyzing gene expression or binding data separately. the new method also produced more functionally coherent tms than two alternative algorithms for joint analysis of gene expression and binding data. in the original publications, both of these algorithms were tested on much larger expression datasets than we used here. however, the functional coherence as measured by the sensitivity and specificity of predicting the co-membership in kegg pathways remained significantly improved for the ecim algorithm in analyzing an order of magnitude larger dataset  <cit> . furthermore, most of the expression datasets examining a specific biological process are similar in size to datasets we used here and so the comparisons we made are very relevant.

since there are no free parameters to adjust or tune during clustering phase, users only need to provide the data and the time consuming sampling process will go by itself, then user can select or change either stringent or relaxed criteria to search qualified gene group and corresponding tfs immediately. the output will show results of the analysis in a familiar form without the need to completely understand the mathematical/computational machinery used. we believe that this is an appealing characteristic of ecim. the model presented here does not account for combinatorial interactions of different tfs in regulating expression. however, the modular nature of the model allows straightforward incorporation of more precise models for chip-chip data which will most likely further improve the performance of the method.
