BACKGROUND
sesquiterpenoids, widely distributed in the plant kingdom, are  <dig> carbon natural products derived from farnesyl diphosphate  by the reactions of sesquiterpene synthases via carbocation intermediates  <cit> . sesquiterpene hydrocarbons are volatile compounds and well known for their contribution to the scent of essential oils or ripe fruits  <cit> . many of these compounds show cyclic chemical structures and exhibit a wide range of biological properties from herbivore defence to signalling info-chemicals in plant-insect interactions  <cit> . biosynthesis of these compounds occurs in various plant organs like conifer resin ducts, leaves, roots, or fruits  <cit> .

sesquiterpene lactones  are a sub-class of sesquiterpenoids and are typical secondary compounds of the asteraceae plant family  <cit> . because of their diverse cytotoxic properties, these compounds are generally separated from the cellular metabolism and stored in specialized cells and compartments like laticifers or glandular trichomes  <cit> . stls show anti-microbial activities and, due to their bitter taste, serve as anti-feedants  <cit> . from sunflower, helianthus annuus, several stls with germacranolide skeleton have been identified from capitate glandular trichomes, which are found on various aerial plant parts, particularly on leaves and anthers of the disk florets  <cit> .

in the last several years, the potent bioactivities of stls, such as anti-malarial activity of artemisinin  <cit> , drew significant interests in the biochemistry of stls. the first committed step in biosynthesis of all cyclic sesquiterpenes and stl is the cyclization of fdp by sesquiterpene synthases in the cytosol  <cit> . germacrene a synthases, catalyzing the first step of stl biosynthesis  <cit> , have been identified from different asteraceae species in the young leaves of ixeris dentata  <cit> , etiolated chicory heads  <cit> , or whole lettuce seedlings  <cit> . from a glandular trichome cdna library of artemisia annua, a germacrene a synthase has been identified which is the first and so far only sesquiterpene synthase which was isolated directly from secretory glandular cells  <cit> .

on the leaves of helianthus annuus, two different types of glandular trichomes are observed: uniserial glandular trichomes producing sesquiterpenes with bisabolene skeleton  <cit>  and capitate glandular trichomes which secrete stl of the germacranolide type  <cit>  and 5-deoxy-flavons  <cit>  into an apical cuticular globe. generally, trichomes on the leaves of asteraceae plants develop in early leaf stages. this strongly complicates the isolation of these specialized chemical factories for identification of enzymes involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis and does not allow a stage-specific analysis of gene expression and secretion process. besides the sunflower leaves, the same glandular trichomes are found at the anther tips of disk florets  <cit> . trichome development in these flower parts proceeds simultaneously with the floret and pollen growth, thus allowing an exact visual assessment of the trichome developmental stages  <cit> . it was shown by microscopic observations and hplc analysis that secretion of stl takes place during the expansion of the subcuticular globe. using a micropreparation technique, sunflower capitate glandular trichomes from anthers could be isolated in specific developmental stages ranging from the pre- to the post-secretory phase. the accessibility of differentially developed trichomes by means of this simple and effective micropreparation technique enabled us to use the sunflower inflorescence as a promising model system to study sesquiterpene lactone metabolism.

besides the germacrene a synthases, only a limited number of terpene synthases have been described from asteraceae. two enantiospecific - and -germacrene d synthases from solidago canadensis  <cit>  have been characterized. in addition, caryophyllene-, epi-cedrol- and amorpha- <dig> -diene synthases were isolated from young leaves of artemisia annua  <cit> .

in this paper, we report the isolation of three sunflower sesquiterpene synthases and their functional characterization in vitro after expression in escherichia coli and in vivo in saccharomyces cerevisiae. furthermore their expression patterns in different sunflower tissues and in different biosynthetic stages during trichome development is analyzed.

RESULTS
identification of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases
sunflower capitate glandular trichomes were isolated in the biosynthetically active stage from anther appendages as previously described  <cit> . degenerated primers for the conserved sequences of sesquiterpene synthases  <cit>  were used in reverse transcription -pcr to retrieve partial sesquiterpene synthase sequences. the deduced amino acid sequences of the two pcr fragments displayed high sequence similarity to other sesquiterpene synthase genes in the public database. the 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cdna ends  led to the identification of two distinct full-length cdnas. the mrna for hatps <dig>  showed a length of  <dig>  bp, containing an orf of  <dig>  bp coding for  <dig> amino acids. the mrna sequences for hatps <dig>  showed a length of  <dig>  bp with an orf of  <dig>  bp coding for  <dig> amino acids. both genes encoded proteins with high similarity to germacrene a synthases from other plant species. the molecular weight of the enzymes was calculated to  <dig> -kda for hatps <dig> and  <dig> -kda for hatps <dig>  falling into the typical mass range of plant sesquiterpene synthases  <cit> .

for further systematic classification of the identified sesquiterpene synthases, the genomic dna  sequences were obtained. pcr amplification of gdna with specific primers for hatps <dig> resulted in a single amplicon. the complete nucleotide sequence showed a length of  <dig>  bp . in contrast to hatps <dig>  pcr amplification with primers for hatps <dig> showed two gdna fragments which differed in length. sequencing of both products resulted in the identification of a third sesquiterpene synthase that showed 95% deduced amino acid identity to the hatps <dig>  thus, the orf of the hatps <dig> and its close homolog was designated as hatps1a and hatps1b , respectively. the gdna sequences for hatps1a/b consisted of highly similar exon structures but differed considerably in their intron length and sequence in particular for the intron  <dig> and  <dig> . the gdna for hatps1a showed a length of  <dig>  bp  while the gdna for hatps1b contained  <dig>  bp . all three sunflower sesquiterpene synthase genes displayed an assembly of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, typical for class iii terpene synthases  <cit> . they belong to the tpsa-gene family  <cit> , a group of genes mainly consisting of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases  <cit> . the orf size in hatps1b was identical to hatps1a  with 95% sequence identity. the hatps1a/b shared 63% amino acid identity with hatps <dig> and shared 94% similarity to germacrene a synthases from asteraceae like lactuca sativa  or cichorium intybus . comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of hatps <dig> with entries in public database showed 62% similarity to asteraceae germacrene a synthases from lettuce or chicory but showed only about 40% identity to δ-cadinene synthases from gossypium arboretum and g. hirsutum  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of all three sesquiterpene synthases contained the common sequence motifs for the sesquiterpene synthase family  <cit> , such as the highly conserved ddxxd and rxr motifs, responsible for the divalent metal ion-substrate binding .

functional characterization of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases hatps <dig> 
for functional characterization, all three synthase genes were heterologously expressed in e. coli as thioredoxin-fusion proteins. the hatps <dig> fusion protein was purified through ni-nta affinity chromatography . the gas chromatograph mass spectroscopy  analysis of the in vitro enzyme assay products with substrate fdp showed the presence of the parental mass of sesquiterpene  but with a very low product yield  which prevented the identification of conversion products. to solve this problem, hatps <dig> was expressed heterologously in vivo in s. cerevisiae using high-copy plasmid pesc-leu2d in the epy <dig> strain which was previously engineered to synthesize copious amount of fdp from simple carbon source  <cit> . the transgenes were induced by the addition of galactose to the medium, and non-volatile dodecane was overlaid on the culture to trap volatile sesquiterpene products. the gc-ms analysis of recombinant enzyme product showed a much higher product yield compared to the in vitro assay , but the fragmentation pattern of the obtained products still did not allow unambiguous product identification. in this analysis, significant accumulation of farnesol was detected in the negative control  and in the products obtained by expression of hatps <dig> in epy <dig>  indicating an incomplete conversion of fdp to sesquiterpenes. to improve the activity of the enzyme, hatps <dig> was expressed as a thioredoxin-fusion protein  in epy <dig>  similar to the expression in e. coli. this modification resulted in a notable increase of synthesized products without altering the overall product profile. farnesol was completely absent in this in vivo assay, indicating a complete conversion of fdp to sesquiterpenes probably due to the significantly enhanced hatps <dig> activity. products of hatps <dig> were identified by comparison with the reference spectra in the nist <dig> library and also with the authentic standards.

one of the two main products was identified as δ-cadinene with α-muurolene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and α-copaene as minor products. this result characterized hatps <dig> as an asteraceae sesquiterpene synthase involved in the biosynthesis of mainly δ-cadinene and other minor sesquiterpenes , and hence it was named as hacs . the second main product remained unidentified, but its fragmentation pattern  showed high similarities to that of an authentic γ-cadinene standard, but differed slightly in the retention time indices . the ri of authentic γ-cadinene was  <dig>  whereas the ri of peak  <dig> was  <dig>  spiking the yeast terpene products with the standard showed a fused, broader peak than the original peak  <dig> or γ-cadinene standard, indicating that peak  <dig> is not γ-cadinene . comparison of this fragmentation pattern with that of δ-cadinene and γ-cadinene indicates that this so far unidentified compound is also a product with a cadinene skeleton, but its chemical identity remains unknown. the fragmentation patterns of peaks  <dig> and  <dig> were very similar to each other  and both showed high similarities to the fragmentation pattern of γ-gurjunene from the nist <dig> library.

multiproduct terpene synthases are known from different plant families. for example, γ-humulene synthase and δ-selinene synthase from abies grandies produce  <dig> and  <dig> products, respectively, from the fdp  <cit> . within asteraceae, only the epi-cedrol synthase from artemisia annua  <cit>  has been described to produce more than one product in significant amount. the only other two sesquiterpene synthases producing sesquiterpenes with the cadinene skeleton were found in gossypium hirsutum and g. arboretum  <cit> .

gc-ms analysis of pentane extracts from isolated glandular trichomes showed small amounts of sesquiterpenes. peaks representing α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene and the unidentified compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  were detected. spme headspace-analysis of sunflower volatiles showed a whole bouquet of different mono- and sesquiterpenes. again sesquiterpenes produced by hacs were detected, this time in larger amounts . these results are in accordance with the report from schuh et al.  <cit>  where β-caryophyllene and α-humulene were detected as volatile emissions from h. annuus. besides the compounds produced from hacs, several other sesquiterpenes were detected in the headspace experiments, indicating the activity of yet unidentified terpene synthases in sunflower. generally, terpene synthases form a large gene family  <cit> , and hence it is evident that more terpene synthases are expressed in different sunflower tissues or still remained unidentified in glandular trichomes.

functional identification of hatps1a and hatps1b as germacrene a synthases 
hatps1a and hatps1b were expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins in e. coli to produce soluble protein. in vitro enzyme assays with purified enzyme showed a single product with the expected mass of m/z  <dig> in the gc-ms measurements . a peak with the same retention time and fragmentation pattern was observed by the analysis of a germacrene a standard, produced by the expression of the previously characterized germacrene a synthase lsltc <dig> from lactuca sativa  <cit> . the identity of the peak from the in vitro assays was determined as β-elemene by an authentic standard. β-elemene is the known cope-rearrangement product of germacrene a due to the hot injection port temperature for gc measurements  <cit> . thus, the hatps1a and hatps1b were named as hagas <dig> and hagas <dig>  respectively.

the performance of both sunflower germacrene a synthases was tested in vivo by expression in yeast and for comparison of the product spectra between in vitro and in vivo expression. hagas <dig> and hagas <dig> were cloned into the pesc-leu2d plasmid and used to transform s. cerevisiae epy <dig>  to produce the germacrene a reference standard, a previously characterized germacrene a synthase from lactuca sativa  was also cloned and expressed under the same conditions. gc-ms analyses of these products showed two identical peaks for all three germacrene a synthases . the earlier eluting peak was identified as β-elemene, whereas the later peak represented germacrene a, as it showed identical fragmentation pattern to the literature data and terpene products from reference gene   <cit> . in contrast to the gc-ms measurements of the in vitro assays, germacrene a produced from in vivo assays was not completely converted to β-elemene. the complete rearrangement of germacrene a to β-elemene depicted in figure 5a is likely due to the high injection port temperature used . these results showed that hagas <dig> and hagas <dig> are germacrene a synthases, which catalyze the first committed reaction for sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis in sunflower. in contrast to hacs, both germacrene a synthases are single product enzymes.

biochemical characterization of sunflower germacrene a synthases
to obtain native hagas <dig> and hagas <dig> enzymes, the e. coli-expressed fusion proteins were digested with enterokinase and further purified to remove the thioredoxin and the enterokinase before biochemical characterization. sds-page showed nearly homogeneous proteins. for determination of the influence of the thioredoxin fusion part on the biochemical properties of hagas <dig>  thioredoxin-hagas <dig> fusion protein was also characterized. hacs did not show reproducible results in vitro and its biochemical properties were not determined.

measured ph-optima were  <dig>  for thioredoxin-hagas <dig>   <dig>  for native hagas <dig> and  <dig>  for native hagas <dig>  apparent km values for fpp were calculated as  <dig>  μm for hagas <dig>   <dig>  μm for thioredoxin-hagas <dig> and  <dig>  μm for hagas <dig>  indicating a similar range like previously reported for sesquiterpene synthases  <cit> . these results indicate that the fused thioredoxin protein part has only minor effects on the properties and catalytic activity of hagas <dig>  in contrast to thioredoxin-hagas <dig> and native hagas <dig>  hagas <dig> showed substrate inhibition characteristics; because the activity decreased with substrate concentrations above  <dig>  μm. substrate inhibition has also been reported for monoterpene synthases from citrus limon  <cit> .

tissue-specific expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases
in order to assess the relative transcript level of sesquiterpene synthase, semi-quantitative rt-pcr experiments were carried out using cdna templates from roots, stem, cotyledons, young and old leaves, ray flowers, and trichomes . the transcript level for farnesyl diphosphate synthase  was also analyzed as this enzyme provides the substrate farnesyl diphosphate  for the sesquiterpene synthases. it could be shown that fdps was expressed in all tissues observed, but was upregulated in those tissues where expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes was detected at highest level . due to very high sequence similarity, the transcripts for hagas <dig> and hagas <dig> could not be distinguished in the rt-pcr analyses. therefore, pcr products for hagas represent the transcripts from both germacrene a synthase genes. the fdps was detectable with different expression intensity in all organs except for cotyledons. hagas and the hacs showed a much more differentiated expression. transcripts of all three genes were traceable in roots and young leaves, but in contrast to hagas, hacs was not expressed in old leaves. the strongest expression of all three genes was detected in capitate glandular trichomes. these results showed the predominant expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthase genes in the highly specialized trichome stalk cells. as the transcript for fdps was also detectable in rna samples from these secretory cells, it is predicted that the whole biosynthetic pathway from the precursor molecules to the secreted stl is located in the sunflower trichomes. transcripts detected in the leaf samples are likely to show the expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes in trichomes located on the leaf epidermis. the expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes in young roots, even though low in comparison to the expression in trichomes, showed that both hagas1/ <dig> and hacs were not exclusively expressed in the aerial parts of the sunflower. these results were confirmed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr experiments . expression of terpene synthases in roots has been described for many plant species and seems to be a common biosynthetic process in plants  <cit> .

as the hagas <dig> and hagas <dig> were not distinguishable by pcr, a restriction digestion was performed to confirm the expression of both genes. the full-length cdna of both synthases was amplified from root and trichome cdna with the same primer pair, and their amplicons were subjected to the differential restriction enzyme digestion. the restriction enzyme drai was identified to cut only hagas <dig> but not hagas <dig>  paui cut hagas <dig> but not hagas. gel separation of the digested products clearly demonstrated the expression of both germacrene a synthases in roots and trichomes .

two lettuce germacrene a synthases were induced in cotyledons by infection with the downy mildew pathogen bremia lactucae  <cit> . in contrast, inoculation of sunflower seedlings with plasmopara halstedii  <cit> , the sunflower downy mildew pathogen, did not induce the expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases in cotyledons or stem and did not have influence on the expression intensity in roots . this indicates that expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the developmental program of the trichome secretory cells and is not induced by the infection with these pathogens.

developmentally regulated expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes in sunflower capitate glandular trichomes
the low density of glandular trichomes and the early termination of the secretory active phase in young leaf stages complicate the isolation of biosynthetically active trichomes from sunflower leaves. however, trichomes from the anther appendages provided an excellent alternative to study developmental gene expression along the trichome development  <cit> . using glands from disk florets of different ages, trichome rna could be isolated from the pre-secretory to post-secretory stage as previously described  <cit> . in order to assess transcriptionally active stages of sunflower trichome cells, semi-quantitative rt-pcr experiments were performed to amplify hagas, hacs, and fdps . while fdps was expressed with the same level in all but the last trichome stage, hagas and hacs were highly regulated and expressed only during the active secretory phase of the capitate glandular trichomes. real-time rt-pcr data indicated that the combined expression level of hagas <dig> and hagas <dig> seems to be significant higher than that of hacs . a stage-specific expression of terpene synthase genes during trichome development has not been reported before. these semi-quantitative rt-pcr results are in line with the biosynthetically active phases of sunflower trichomes determined by microscopic observations of fluorescent flavones in trichomes and hplc-measurements of stl content  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
three sesquiterpene synthase genes isolated from pure trichomes were functionally expressed in e. coli and s. cerevisiae. the terpene product analysis by gc-ms showed that they encode two distinct types of sesquiterpene synthases – germacrene a synthase  and δ-cadinene synthase . the expression of hagas1/ <dig> and hacs in engineered yeast significantly increased the yield of terpene production and thus benefited the identification of terpenes without the need to purify enzymes and to use expensive substrate. all three sesquiterpene synthases were predominantly expressed in the stalk cells of capitate glandular trichomes at active secretory stages. the use of trichomes from anther appendages provides an excellent model system for the analysis of differentially expressed genes during stl biosynthesis. since the trichomes can be isolated at specific biosynthetic stages, the isolated trichomes can be used to generate expressed-sequence tags or microarray probes, hence providing valuable experimental tools to study stl biochemistry in asteraceae.
