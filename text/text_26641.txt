BACKGROUND
at the time of the first settlers over  <dig> years ago  <cit> , madagascar harboured a greater faunal and floral diversity than today. pygmy hippos and the world's largest bird – the great elephant bird aepyornis maximus – are just two striking examples of those endemic species that began to decline and finally disappeared completely in the centuries following human colonization  <cit> . albeit emblematic of madagascar , lemurs do not stand as an exception  <cit> . some  <dig>  years ago, they inhabited a wide variety of wooded terrains, from forests to open woodlands and marshlands  <cit> . a spectacular array of life history traits derives from a single ancestral primate that colonized madagascar around 60mya  <cit> . but human activities, such as overhunting and habitat modifications related to farming and pastoralism, led at least  <dig> species – belonging to nine different genera – to eventual extinction  <cit> . several entire families – the archaeolemuridae, palaeopropithecidae, and megaladapidae – disappeared.

because all of the extinct species were larger than extant species, they are called 'giant' lemurs. some of them displayed particularly spectacular features . the palaeopropithecidae, including the most specialized genus, palaeopropithecus and its close relative archaeoindris, as well as the smaller-bodied babakotia and mesopropithecus, were so convergent on tree sloths that they have been dubbed the "sloth lemurs"  <cit> . however, archaeoindris, despite its specializations for climbing, would have had to spend most of its time on the ground due to a body mass  rivalling that of male gorillas  <cit> . the megaladapids, some of which rivalled female gorillas in body mass at ca.  <dig> kg  <cit> , were slow climbers capable of suspension but not leaping  <cit> . they sported peculiar cranial specializations for consuming leaves and converged postcranially with koalas; they have thus been dubbed "koala lemurs."

extinct and extant lemurs exhibit an extraordinary range in body size and diversity of locomotor and dietary patterns. ecologically driven convergences have considerably confounded interpretations of the phylogenetic relationships among lemurs. however, morphological data  have aided in the construction of a number of different phylogenetic hypotheses  <cit>  some of which have been tested using molecular tools. for instance, crovella et al.  used hybridization features of highly repeated dna probes to support the proximity of the extinct pachylemur insignis to the ruffed lemurs   <cit> . more recently, using pcr to recover short overlapping fragment over the cytochrome b gene, yoder et al.   <cit>  and karanth et al.   <cit>  were able to confirm palaeopropithecidae as a sister group of extant indriids but challenged the long-standing proximity of megaladapis to lepilemur.

other thorny phylogenetic questions still await a molecular contribution. such is the case for the least arboreal and most terrestrial lemurs, the archaeolemuridae  <cit> . among lemuriformes, this family is presumed to belong to the superfamily indrioidea and consists of three extinct species: archaeolemur edwardsi, archaeolemur majori, and hadropithecus stenognathus  <cit> . hadropithecus survived until the end of the first millennium a.d. whereas archaeolemur experienced at least a half-a-millennium reprieve  <cit> , possibly thanks to a greater plasticity of resources/habitat exploitation  <cit> . all of the archaeolemuridae were extremely powerfully built  <cit>  and exhibited characters reminiscent of cercopithecoids  <cit> . on the basis of cranial anatomy and dental morphology, archaeolemuridae have been considered the sister taxon of extant indriids and the palaeopropithecids   <cit> . however, developmental features  <cit>  as well as the postcranial characters of a newly excavated hadropithecus subadult  recently challenged this consensual scenario and underscored striking similarities with lemurids . the debate is therefore still open  <cit> .

none of the  <dig> archaeolemurid specimens analysed so far by molecular biologists yielded amplifiable dna  <cit> . in this study, we undertook an extensive analysis of  <dig> new archaeolemur and hadropithecus subfossil remains. we report for the first time the successful characterization of 94– <dig> bp along two mitochondrial genes . this sequence data provides a good support for a sistership between archaeolemurids and extant indriids, in agreement with the most generally accepted morphological phylogenetic scenario but in contrast to recent suggestions made on the basis of analyses of dental developmental and postcranial data.

RESULTS
to further investigate the evolutionary history of giant lemurs, we performed an ancient dna study on  <dig> subfossil remains representing  <dig> individuals belonging to three extinct giant lemur genera . short, overlapping segments of three mitochondrial genes  and one nuclear gene  were targeted by pcr . the maximal amplicon length was about  <dig> bp . among the  <dig> specimens analyzed, only  <dig> yielded amplifiable dna although numerous extractions and pcr reactions were performed . it is noteworthy that none of the control region fragments targeted gave positive results, suggesting poor efficiency of the pcr primers used here. even for samples that delivered authentic mtdna fragments, no nuclear dna was recovered although fragments as short as  <dig> bp were targeted . the specimen under collection number 1937– <dig> at the mnhn yielded authentic dna fragments when a bone fragment  was sampled but no result when a molar root  was analyzed . all in all, these results suggest poor dna preservation conditions in the subfossils, which is consistent with what is known about dna decay in warm subtropical environments  <cit>  and with a previous ancient dna survey of malagasy subfossils  <cit> .

column 'ancient dna' summarizes the samples that gave authentic ancient dna fragments.

despite such difficulties, we managed to recover authentic ancient dna sequences from individuals belonging to each of the three genera sampled . sample ch <dig>  allowed the recovery of a 190-bp cytochrome b sequence that exhibited one and three transitions with the two megaladapis sequences reported in  <cit>  . notably, all these sequences were highly divergent  from the megaladapis haplotype described in  <cit>  . this haplotype  was already criticized by karanth et al.   <cit>  and is now definitively confirmed as a probable pcr-contaminant. archaeolemur majori samples  delivered respectively 269-bp and 335-bp in cytochrome b . both sequences were identical over the  <dig> shared nucleotides but markedly different from all available lemur sequences. archaeolemur edwardsi sample ch <dig> instead yielded a 190-bp cytochrome b sequence  that exhibited only a minimum number of  <dig> substitutions with archaeolemur majori haplotypes while the 94-bp cytochrome b sequence obtained from hadropithecus stenognathus sample ch <dig> was found to exhibit a larger divergence from the archaeolemur sequences . raw divergences were in good agreement with what was expected from morphological similarities between these species and genera  <cit> . because our procedures respect the most stringent criteria of authenticity , we are confident that the ancient dna sequences reported here are authentic and we used them in phylogenetic analyses .

accordingly, we retrieved all strepsirrhine cytochrome b and 12s rrna sequences available in genbank and generated  <dig> different datasets . for each of these datasets, phylogenetic trees were built using both maximum likelihood and bayesian methods. including the new archaeolemur and hadropithecus sequences in the dataset confirmed the indisputable monophyly of malagasy lemuriformes. this provided supplemental support to the scenario of a single origin for all malagasy primates  <cit>   and therefore to the authenticity of our sequences . furthermore, most phylogenies showed the best bootstrap values and posterior probabilities for a sistership between archaeolemur  and indriids . alternative topologies relating archaeolemur  to either lemurids, cheirogaleids, lepilemurids or lorisiformes received no more than marginal bootstrap values or posterior probabilities . therefore, regardless of the phylogenetic method or the sequence dataset used, the ancient dna sequences recovered in this study supported the existence of an archaeolemuridae-indriidae clade . interestingly, despite significant variation among datasets , approximately unbiased  and kh tests  <cit>  come to similar conclusions by rejecting the  <dig> latter alternative topologies and by showing maximal p-values for the sistership between archaeolemur  and indriids. it is noteworthy, also, that the molecular topology presented here  matches exactly that presented for extant taxa only by delpero et al.   <cit>  on page 440) as one of the "two remarkably similar topologies that were strongly supported at most of the internal nodes". however, a phylogenomic toolkit using extensive nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data came to different conclusions regarding the position of propithecus  and lepilemur   <cit> . interestingly, the former position shows conflict between loci since three of them strongly support the classical view of a sistership of propithecus and lemurids. furthermore, the authors of this analysis note possible taxonomic bias in their analysis since except for propithecus, no taxa from the family indriidae  have been considered. this added to the limited amount of sequence information used in our study could explain these discrepancies. in any case, the sequences presented in this study sustain the sistership between archaeolemur  and indriids as the most likely phylogenetic scenario. consequently, we can now define a true series of synapomorphies for archaeolemurids, palaeopropithecids, and indriids  at both the dental and postcranial levels .

phylogenetic supports for the nesting of archaeolemur  within different taxa  are given in the  <dig> last columns. bootstrap percentages or posterior probabilities are given for likelihood and bayesian analyses, respectively. * in this topology, archaeolemur actually appears as the sister taxon of the aye-aye but both are nested within paraphyletic indriids. this finding most likely results from a long branch attraction artifact.

interestingly, if our molecular data unambiguously link archaeolemurids to indriids, they do not give insights into the phylogenetic relationships within the indrioidea, as ingroup nodes do not receive conclusive bootstrap values and posterior probabilities . however, morphological and developmental characters have recently provided unambiguous support for considering the palaeopropithecids as the sister to the indriidae  . for this reason, this is our preferred phylogeny.

discussion
the idea that the archaeolemuridae, palaeopropithecidae and indriidae comprise a clade within the lemuriformes is not new. indeed, affinities of archaeolemur to indriines were recognized by lorenz von liburnau in  <dig> when he named "protoindris globiceps" on the basis of a photograph of a skull  that had been collected by franz sikora in  <dig> at andrahomana cave in southeastern madagascar  <cit> . standing  treated archaeolemur as an indriid  <cit> , and g. e. smith  discussed the indriid character of its brain  <cit> . since that time, craniodental studies have consistently recognized the phylogenetic affinity of indrioidea and their separation from other lemurs. often, the three families are treated as subfamilies within the family indriidae, which in turn is placed within the lemuroidea. in their review of the craniodental evidence, tattersall and schwartz  came to the same conclusion  <cit> . however, they and other researchers since have recognized that the clade as a whole is not supported by a large number of morphological traits, and that different suites of morphological traits might be used to defend very different phylogenetic hypotheses. moreover king et al.  examined the sequence of fusion of postcranial epiphyses, dental eruption, and closure of cranial sutures in archaeolemur and two living lemurs  in an effort to evaluate functional and phylogenetic implications of developmental data  <cit> . these authors noted that the sequence data failed to demonstrate similarities of archaeolemur to propithecus, but rather showed greater likeness to eulemur. in addition, studies of recently-found carpal elements of palaeopropithecus, archaeolemur, and hadropithecus have demonstrated greater likenesses of the archaeolemurids to lemurids  <cit> .

given that the archaeolemuridae-lemuridae sistership is not supported by our molecular data, one interpretation is that the lemurid-likenesses of the archaeolemuridae are primitive  for indriids, palaeopropithecids, archaeolemurids, and lemurids. another is that they represent convergences of archaeolemurids and lemurids due to shared quadrupedalism, although this cannot account for developmental likenesses. godfrey  reconstructed the common ancestor of the indrioidea as a versatile and probably arboroterrestrial quadruped with limb proportions and a positional repertory not very different from those of the lemurids, varecia or pachylemur  <cit> . such a scenario  would explain the manual similarities of the archaeolemuridae and the lemuridae. this author also reconstructed the common ancestor of the indriids and palaeopropithecids as a generalized quadrupedal climber/hanger, with striking synapomorphies of the upper limb, hands, and feet. according to this interpretation, an initial split divided the indrioidea into two clades, one of which  specialized in terrestrial quadrupedalism while the other  specialized in slow quadrupedal climbing and hanging. the latter subsequently split into two clades, one of which  sacrificed rapid locomotion of any sort to perfect deliberate hanging skills, the other of which  sacrificed quadrupedalism to develop a new form of 'vertical clinging and leaping' while retaining sloth-like hanging skills.

this unique combination of locomotor/postural features and dental adaptations in archaeolemurids is probably the reason why their phylogenetic status has been so difficult to decipher. this study demonstrates the value of the ancient dna approach in solving the phylogenetic relationships among extinct and extant taxa, especially in situations involving rampant morphological homoplasy, morphological plasticity with rapid change in body size  <cit> , or sexual dimorphism  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have been successful in amplifying and sequencing the first ancient dna sequences of all the members of an enigmatic lemur family: the archaeolemurids . these 'giant lemurs' lived in madagascar centuries ago but have been led to extinction by human activities. our new sequences solve the phylogenetic position of archaeolemurids as close relatives of both the sloth lemurs and the indriids. this appears in sharp contrast with most recent ontogenetic studies as well as new discoveries of postcranial elements of the archaeolemurids that indicate striking similarities with lemurids. in light of our new phylogenetic framework, we were able to reinterpret the available cranial and postcranial data. our data offer support for a particular scenario of the evolution of the indrioidea locomotor apparatus .
