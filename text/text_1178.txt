BACKGROUND
chromosome y  stands out from all other chromosomes: it is comprised for most of its length of sequences that do not recombine , it contains many repetitive dna sequences of unclear significance, and it harbors only a small number of active genes  <cit> . genes from the male-specific part of chry are clearly not essential for life, as demonstrated in female organisms. besides sry , most of what is known about the functions of other chry genes relates to their effects on male reproductive and sex accessory organs  <cit> . nonetheless, genetic variants of chry have been shown to have an impact on functions unrelated to male reproductive biology, including the severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in mice  <cit> , the incidence of prostate cancer in humans  <cit> , and several cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and high plasma cholesterol in either humans or animal models  <cit> . the mechanism explaining these particular effects of chry genes are still unclear, and cannot be explored by using classical genetic methods because chry genes do not recombine.

recently, we have reported that chry accounts for a large part of the genetic variance of the size of adult male heart muscle cells  isolated from mice derived from crosses between a/j and c57bl/6j  <cit> . in agreement with the linkage mapping results, we also found that when chry from the parental strain c57bl/6j  was substituted for that of a/j mice , cms from the resulting "chromosome substitution"  c57bl/6j-chrya strain  were smaller than that of their c57bl/6j counterparts. in reverse, when chrya from a/j mice was substituted for that of chryc <dig>  cms from the resulting a/j-chryc <dig> strain  were larger than in their a/j counterparts. since the only genetic differences in these unique animal models are those possibly existing between c57bl/6j and c <dig> ya, we used these strains to further test whether, in addition to affecting the size of cms, the origin of chry could also be linked to differences in the profile of gene expression in the hearts of adult male mice. moreover, since: 1) one of the most obvious consequences of chry is to foster the development of male gonads and the production of testosterone, and 2) there is preliminary evidence that chry polymorphisms may interfere with some biologic effects of testosterone  <cit> , we tested whether postpubertal testosterone could play a role in the differential morphologic and/or molecular effects of chryc <dig> and chrya on cardiac cells.

RESULTS
in extension to our previous findings showing that cms from strains carrying chryc <dig> were larger than that from their counterparts carrying chrya  <cit> , we found that prepubertal castration  decreased the size of cms in adult animals from strains carrying yc <dig> , but not in their counterparts carrying chry from a/j , i.e. a/j and c <dig> ya mice . the effect of castration  was not the result of testosterone production being higher in c57bl/6j mice, as plasma testosterone in adult male c57bl/6j mice  was in fact lower than in their a/j  or c <dig> ya  counterparts, this result being in agreement with another report showing that the levels of plasma testosterone are lower in male c57bl/6j mice than in several other mouse inbred strains  <cit> . likewise, the abundance of androgen receptor mrna and protein was similar in the hearts of all strains . however, chronic treatment of mice that had been castrated at  <dig> weeks of age with  <dig> dosages of testosterone from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of age increased the size of cms of c57bl/6j in a dose-dependent fashion, but not in the consomic strain c <dig> ya . in contrast, testosterone also increased the size of cms from consomic a.yc <dig> in a dose-dependent fashion, although we had found that cardiomyocytes from the parental a/j strain were not affected by cx. altogether, these results showed that the difference in size of cms from intact  c57bl/6j and c <dig> ya male mice resulted from the fact that cardiomyocytes from c <dig> ya were not sensitive to the hypertrophic effects of post-pubertal testosterone.

we next compared the cardiac transcriptosomes of  <dig> sham-operated and  <dig> cx adult male mice from the c57bl/6j and c <dig> ya strains. the numbers of probes and corresponding genes showing differential expression between groups  are summarized in table  <dig>  we found that the effects of post-pubertal testosterone and/or the origin of chry affected the profile of cardiac gene expression in a manner that was very different than their respective effects on the size of cms. for instance, although post-pubertal testosterone had no effect on the size of cms from c <dig> ya male mice, it affected the expression level of many cardiac genes in that strain, and even of a greater number of genes than in their c57bl/6j counterparts. this indicated that the lack of hypertrophic effects of post-pubertal testosterone on cms from c <dig> ya was not the manifestation of an insensitivity of cells from this strain to androgens, but rather the result of a differential molecular response to the hormone. likewise, despite the fact that the effect of chry on the size of cms was observed only in sham intact c57bl/6j mice but not in their cx counterparts, more cardiac genes showed chry-dependent differential expression in cx than in sham intact animals. this indicated that the presence of post-pubertal testosterone was not required in order to observe an effect of chry. finally, in addition to the marginal effects of strain and surgery, we also tested for interaction between these two factors, which allowed us to identify within the genome  <dig> unique genes  whose expression was affected by cx  differentially according to the genetic origin of chry . most interactions genes showed rather large differences in gene expression, as ~44% of them displayed either strain-dependent differences or surgery-dependent changes were greater than  <dig>  fold. to validate the results of the microarray analysis, we performed real-time rt-pcr quantifications for  <dig> of the interaction genes. the differences detected by rt-pcr were similar to those that had been detected with the microarray .

to further determine 1) which particularly surgery group comprised genes where the strain-dependent differences in expression varied according to the surgery status, and 2) to which particular strain corresponded genes where the effect of cx varied according to the origin of chry, we performed post-hoc analyses on the hybridization results obtained with probes from all interaction genes. accordingly, we found that the expression of interaction genes was differentially affected by strain to a greater extent in cx  than in intact sham  mice  . likewise, genes responded to cx in a strain-specific manner to a greater extent in c <dig> ya  than in c57bl6/j  mice  .

in order to assess the biological significance of the interaction genes, we performed a set enrichment test for every pathway in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  to calculate the probability of observing a given number of selected genes in a pathway by chance. the six following kegg pathways showed enrichment for interaction genes using a p-value â‰¤  <dig>  as a criteria for selection: circadian rhythm , p <dig> signaling pathway , melanoma , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , leukocyte transendothelial migration , and tight junction  . however, it should be noted that there is some overlap between the groups of genes assigned by kegg to each pathways: melanoma shares  <dig> genes with either p <dig> signaling pathway or cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, it also shares  <dig> genes with tight junction, and the latter shares  <dig> genes with leukocyte transendothelial migration. this is likely to result from the fact that the kegg classification is somewhat arbitrary, and sometimes assigns genes on the basis of particular biologic manifestations rather than regulatory pathways or functions. nonetheless, overlap between kegg pathways suggests that a common biological process underlies the selection of these particular genes. of note, one additional limitation of the set enrichment test is that the coverage of kegg pathways is still incomplete at the current time. for instance, although dbp, tef, nr1d <dig> and rora are all well-known downstream effectors of clock genes  <cit> , none of them have been included yet within the kegg circadian rhythm pathway. likewise, myl <dig> has not been assigned to either leukocyte transendothelial migration or tight junction despite being highly homologous to myl <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> interaction genes enriched within kegg pathways display strain-dependent differences or surgery-dependent changes that were greater than  <dig>  fold , which may constitute one other indication that these particular genes play biologically important roles.

listed kegg pathways correspond to those showing significant enrichment  for "interaction genes". size corresponds to the number of genes assigned by kegg within each particular pathway. expected count corresponds to the number of interaction genes could be expected to be found if there was no significant enrichment, count corresponds to the effective number of genes showing significant enrichment  .

circadian rhythm, in addition to being the kegg pathway showing the most significant enrichment for interactions genes, also comprised genes showing some of the largest differences in expression among interaction genes. if we consider all  <dig> genes that could be classified as "circadian" on the basis of both kegg pathway database and additional annotation from the literature, we found that expression of  <dig> of them were significantly affected by cx in c <dig> ya mice in contrast to only one gene in c57bl/6j . although only  <dig> genes were included in the interaction genes set, the post-hoc tests revealed evidence for interaction in two extra circadian genes, i.e. csnk1e and csnk1d, that showed 20% increase in castrated animals but only in the c <dig> yastrain. as a consequence of this differential response to post-pubertal testosterone, most circadian genes showed strain-dependent differences in cardiac expression between intact c57bl/6j and c <dig> ya mice, but not in their cx counterparts . one caveat concerning these experimental results is that expression of circadian genes is, by definition, very sensitive to time. although we took care of killing all mice at the same time of day , further validation requires additional experiments using mice from both strains killed at different times of the 24-hour nyctemer. nonetheless, there are currently other lines of evidence suggesting that the current results are biologically pertinent, since: 1) recent reports showed that androgens are major regulators of clock genes in c57bl/6j mice and that they are responsible for sex-dependent differences in circadian activity  <cit> , and 2) male c57bl/6j mice do not show  circadian oscillations of heart rate   <cit> . moreover, it has also been reported recently that arntl/bmal <dig> is a major regulator of cdkn1a  and that arntl-dependent changes in the concentration of the corresponding p21waf1/kip <dig> protein correlate with changes in the rate of liver cell proliferation, in keeping with the known functions of this cyclin inhibitor  <cit> .

genes were considered as "circadian" on the basis of information from both the kegg pathway database and additional annotation from the literature. fc: fold change of cx over sham operated animals; fdr: p-values for the interaction between strain and treatment effects after adjustment for multiple comparisons with an fdr transformation ; fdr values <  <dig>  are formatted in bold.

within the p <dig> signaling pathway , ccnd <dig>  pten and cdkn1a may be of particular interest. indeed, ccnd <dig> encodes for cyclin d <dig> which is considered as one of the few bona fide ar-specific co-repressors, both in androgen-dependent and-independent environments  <cit> . cyclin d <dig>  can be silenced by akt  <cit> , and the latter may be more active in cx c57bl/6j because its inhibitor pten is down-regulated vs. cx c <dig> ya. cyclin d <dig> can also be silenced by the p21waf1/kip <dig> cyclin inhibitor protein   <cit> , the latter being upregulated in cx c57bl/6j vs. cx c <dig> ya. finally, an active akt pathway may stimulate the androgen pathway in part via phosphorylation of the androgen receptor  <cit> . if all these strain-dependent differences in gene expression in cx animals translate into changes at the protein level, the balance between co-repressors and co-activators would tip towards the latter in cx male c57bl/6j mice . of note, some degree of constitutive activation of the ar in cx male c57bl/6j might explain why fewer genes respond to post-pubertal t in this strain than in c <dig> ya mice, and why there are fewer differences in gene expression in intact c57bl6/j and c <dig> ya than in their cx counterparts. likewise, increased sensitivity of the ar might explain why plasma testosterone is lower in intact c67bl6/j than in c <dig> ya mice, as measured by ourselves  and in agreement with a previous report  <cit> .

expression of cdkn1a is increased ~5-fold in the hearts of intact vs. cx c <dig> ya , which is in keeping with previous reports showing that this gene is an important target of activated androgen receptors  <cit> . however, there was also striking strain-selectivity in the response, as there are no changes in expression between intact and cx c57bl/6j mice. interestingly, cdkn1a  has been shown to escape from androgen-dependence in some types of prostate cancers, and this phenomenon has been implicated as one of the possible factors leading to an increase in the growth properties of these cells  <cit> . although cardiac cells are post-mitotic, p <dig> may act on these cells as a negative regulator of hypertrophy  <cit> . the lack of response of cdkn1a to post-pubertal testosterone in c57bl/6j might thus provide an explanation for why pubertal androgens increase the size of cardiomyocytes in this strain, but not in c <dig> ya.

thirteen genes have been reported on the male-specific portion of mouse chry. the short arm of mouse chry  contains the best characterized sequences to date, i.e. sry and the  <dig> following genes: ube1y <dig>  zfy <dig>  zfy <dig>  jarid1d, eif2s3y, uty, ddx3y, usp9y and rbmy1a <dig>  <cit> . three other genes, i.e. ssty <dig>  ssty <dig> and sly, are present on the long arm  in multiple copies  <cit> . out of these  <dig> genes, we found only  <dig> of them to be expressed in hearts, i.e. ddx3y, uty, eif2s3y, jarid1d and sly . these genes appear to be expressed in a ubiquitous fashion, as we have detected by rt-pcr corresponding amplification products in many other non-cardiac tissues . the first four of these genes were present on the illumina mouseref- <dig> v <dig>  beadchip, whose analysis revealed possibly significant differences among experimental groups. for ddx3y, the effect of strain was significant , but not that of surgery nor the interaction between the two. for eif2s3y, the interaction  was significant . however, quantification of the level of expression of ddx3y and eif2s3y in the same samples by quantitative rt-pcr did not reveal any significant effect of strain or surgery in hearts from adult mice . we also measured by quantitative rt-pcr the level of expression of all  <dig> genes in hearts of c57bl.6j and c <dig> ya mice at different times during development. at the time of birth , both ddx3y and eif2s3y showed lower levels of expression in hearts from c57bl/6j male mice compared to their c <dig> ya counterparts . however, no polymorphism was found between the  <dig> strains for the regions including ~ <dig> kb of upstream promoter and each exon . it therefore remains to be determined whether the perinatal differences in expression of these two chry genes may relate to differences in the effects of post-pubertal testosterone during adult life, and if so, by which mechanism. likewise, which polymorphisms on chry may be responsible for such differences needs additional sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
the increased size of cardiomyocytes from adult male c57bl/6j mice compared to c57bl/6j-chrya resulted from the absence of hypertrophic effects of post-pubertal testosterone on cells from the latter strain. however, gene profiling revealed that the lack or hypertrophic effects could not be explained on the basis of an insensitivity of cells from c57bl/6j-chrya to androgens, because post-pubertal testosterone affected the expression of more genes in hearts from in c57bl/6j-chrya than in that from c57bl/6j. moreover, several cardiac genes responded to post-pubertal testosterone in a strict strain-selective manner. these findings provide possible mechanisms explaining how chry may, in part via interference with androgen regulatory events, be linked to morphologic differences of cardiac cells of adult male mice. of note, there are well-known differences in the manifestations of cardiovascular diseases between men and women  <cit> . despite the important contributions of post-pubertal sex steroids, the latter do not account for all differences, and there is now evidence that genes present on sex chromosomes also play important roles as well  <cit> . in light of the current data, it becomes worth testing further to which extent: 1) chry related associations can be explained in terms of modulation of the effects of androgens, and 2) chry may participate to male/female differences in cardiovascular diseases.
