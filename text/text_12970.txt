BACKGROUND
different classes of herbicide act on plants through direct induction of oxidative injury. herbicides of the triazine, phenolic and urea families, which bind to the d <dig> protein, inhibit photosystem ii , and block electron transfer to the plastoquinone pool  <cit> , thus causing the production of triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen . in cyanobacterial cells, 1o <dig> has been shown to cause direct photodamage to psii and d <dig> protein and to prevent psii repair by suppressing elongation of d <dig> protein  <cit> . furthermore, 1o <dig> may generate other reactive oxygen species , such as hydroxyl radical   <cit> , and probably superoxide anion   <cit> . 1o <dig> can also act as a signalling molecule inducing stress and necrotic responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . the lethal effects of psii inhibitors can thus be ascribed to ros injury rather than to nutritional stress and carbon starvation  <cit> .

exogenous treatment with sucrose, and to a lesser extent with glucose, was found to confer to arabidopsis plantlets a very high level of tolerance to the triazine herbicide atrazine  <cit> . sugar-treated plants were able to maintain psii activity and phototrophic growth in the presence of atrazine concentrations, up to  <dig> μm, that are otherwise lethal, in the absence of sugar treatment. moreover, sucrose-protected atrazine-treated arabidopsis plantlets maintained active growth and oxygen evolution  <cit> , thus suggesting that other mechanisms than phototrophic-photoheterotrophic transitions may be involved in sucrose-based protection against atrazine and ros injury. since notable differences of protection were conferred by glucose and sucrose for the same supply of carbon equivalents  <cit> , we reasoned that protection also involved other physiological effects than metabolic feeding to energy and anti-oxidative pathways.

the demonstration that sugars acted as regulators of gene expression in plants  <cit>  has led to the characterisation of a growing number of sugar-regulated genes. thus, glucose or sucrose treatment in the absence of abiotic stress usually represses photosynthesis-related genes in plants  <cit>  and in cyanobacterial cells  <cit> . this is the case for psba mrna and d <dig> protein accumulation in higher plants  <cit> . in the cyanobacterium synechocystis, glucose feeding depresses the steady-state mrna levels of psii genes  <cit>  and, under dark conditions, induces the destabilisation of psba transcripts  <cit> . surprisingly, sucrose treatment of arabidopsis plantlets in the presence of atrazine results in markedly enhanced accumulation of psba mrna and d <dig> protein, which could be interpreted as derepression of sugar-induced repression of photosynthesis-related genes  <cit> . moreover, application of ros, especially h2o <dig>  or changes of the glutathione redox state in the dark enhance psba gene expression, which may thus help replenish d <dig> protein under conditions of oxidative stress  <cit> . given that atrazine treatment itself had negative effects on d <dig> protein levels, the observed derepression in the presence of sucrose and atrazine  <cit>  was therefore likely to result from interactions between sugar and oxidative stimuli. on the other hand, typical markers of ros response have been shown to respond to interacting sugar and oxidative cues. thus, sulmon et al.  <cit>  showed that, during sucrose-induced protection against atrazine treatment, fsd <dig>  gene expression, which was slightly increased by sugar treatment per se and did not respond to atrazine treatment per se, was greatly enhanced in the presence of both sucrose and atrazine.

however, the extent of these interacting effects is not known. as outlined by thum et al.  <cit>  in their study of light and carbon signalling, the general picture of how interactions between sucrose and xenobiotic affect gene regulation must be gleaned from large-scale transcriptomic studies. in order to characterize these interactions and to obtain further insight into the roles of exogenous sugars in the tolerance to herbicides and oxidative stress, a catma whole arabidopsis genome array  <cit>  approach was undertaken. the microarray analysis was used to characterise the responses of arabidopsis plantlets treated for  <dig> h in the presence of atrazine alone, sucrose alone, and sucrose plus atrazine and was complemented with a time-course study of a subset of genes using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . this genome-wide approach revealed that the primary effects of atrazine affected seedling physiology at a much larger scale than usually described in the literature, with the potential impairment of protein translation and of ros defence mechanism, and that, correlatively, sucrose conferred atrazine protection through important modifications of transcript levels, not only as an effect of sucrose itself on stress response genes, but also as a result of sucrose and atrazine interactions that revealed the induction of novel stress defence genes. finally, since sucrose application, which enhances xenobiotic tolerance, accumulation in plants, and consecutively decontamination of surrounding soil, appears to be potentially useful for phytoremediation  <cit> , characterization of gene markers related to xenobiotic protection will be important to analyse phytoremediation properties in the field.

RESULTS
physiological effects of atrazine and sucrose treatments
in order to obtain insight into sucrose-induced atrazine tolerance, to characterize specific and beneficial effects of sucrose and to establish an analysis of gene functions under tolerance or stress conditions, the first step was to determine a treatment yielding plantlets at an early stage of injury, and presenting effects on gene transcription prior to advanced and visible effects of cell death. thus, at  <dig> h of transfer, atrazine-treated plantlets could be compared to mannitol-treated, sucrose-treated, and sucrose plus atrazine-treated plantlets which had not yet undergone significant developmental changes resulting from the treatment and were therefore in a comparable physiological state . in order to study the same developmental stage of plantlets, arabidopsis plantlets were grown on murashige and skoog agar medium and transferred at the  <dig>  development stage  <cit>  to murashige and skoog agar medium supplemented with mannitol  as osmotic control , mannitol  plus atrazine  as herbicide treatment , sucrose  as sugar effect control  and sucrose  plus atrazine  as protective treatment . ma treatment induced complete bleaching of plantlets after  <dig> to  <dig> days of stress application, thus leading to seedling death within  <dig> days . in contrast sa treatments allowed plantlets to maintain growth and development beyond  <dig> days of transfer. the herbicide treatment produced root growth inhibition upon  <dig> h of transfer, while the other conditions resulted in recovery of root growth within  <dig> days of treatment. chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were identical for all treatments upon  <dig> h of transfer . pigment contents were maintained between  <dig> and  <dig> days of sa treatment whereas these values decreased between  <dig> and  <dig> days of ma treatment. this difference between ma and sa treatments resulted in complete death of ma plantlets and in maintenance of growth and development in sa plantlets. this was correlated with measurements of photosystem ii efficiency , which stayed unchanged for all treatments after  <dig> h of treatment . after  <dig> days of sa treatment, psii still showed significant efficiency, while no psii efficiency was detected for the herbicide treatment.

given that ma treatment induced significant injuries on shoot physiology and root growth from  <dig> h to  <dig> days, thus resulting in various secondary effects related to injury and bleaching, we chose to study plantlets at  <dig> h of treatment where primary effects of atrazine exposure could be analysed.

effects of atrazine and sucrose on global gene expression
mannitol treatment  was chosen as the control for all comparisons in order to filter osmotic-responsive genes . differentially expressed genes, i.e. showing at least one p-value ≤  <dig>  after bonferroni correction, in ma/m, sa/m or s/m comparisons were selected. among the  <dig>  <dig> gene-specific tags, corresponding to  <dig>  <dig> genes plus  <dig> chloroplastic and mitochondrial probes,  <dig> probes  were significantly differentially expressed in at least one of the  <dig> comparisons with only  <dig> belonging to the mitochondrial genome and  <dig> to the chloroplastic genome.

in order to define specificity and crosstalk among the transcriptomic responses for the studied treatments, we analysed overlapping of downregulated and upregulated genes for s, sa and ma treatments . the data set clearly demonstrated that the stress condition  was responsible for downregulation of a large quantity of transcripts:  <dig> specifically atrazine-repressed genes compared to  <dig> and  <dig> genes specifically repressed by the sucrose-atrazine combination and sucrose alone, respectively. the low number of genes commonly repressed  or induced  by sucrose alone or by atrazine alone and unaffected by sa treatment revealed the important differences of the gene expression modifications between the two treatments. atrazine-tolerant plantlets  presented a larger number of upregulated genes  than plantlets under the other conditions . given that the sa treatment shared one parameter with the other treatments, the large number of genes specifically induced  or repressed  in the simultaneous presence of atrazine and sucrose strongly indicated a combined effect of the two factors.

the normalized log <dig> generated by the statistical analysis was used to describe the extent of transcriptional change between the ma/m, sa/m and s/m comparisons. in order to focus the study on highly repressed or induced transcripts, genes whose log <dig> was greater than  <dig>  or lower than - <dig>   in at least one comparison were considered as highly-responsive. these criteria gave a total of  <dig> highly-responsive genes available in additional file  <dig>  among these selected genes,  <dig> and  <dig> loci were found to be, respectively, upregulated and downregulated by atrazine treatment. sucrose alone was responsible for increase of expression of  <dig> genes and decrease of expression of  <dig> genes. under tolerance conditions, atrazine and sucrose generated induction of  <dig> genes and repression of  <dig> genes. contrary to other treatments, sucrose-treated atrazine-tolerant plantlets therefore showed strong increase in upregulated genes correlated with a decrease in downregulated genes, thus suggesting induction of specific protective mechanisms.

the expression profiles of  <dig> genes, belonging to various functional categories and showing various expression patterns in the microarray, were analysed by qrt-pcr under the same conditions as those of the microarray experiment . in all cases, due to the normalization steps, the fold changes obtained with the qrt-pcr were higher than those on the microarray, but gave comparable expression profiles relatively to the different treatments.

identification of protection-related functional categories
in order to investigate biological processes involved, transcripts showing 3-fold variations of expression were assigned to functional categories based on the munich information centre for protein sequence database   <cit>  . transcripts with no clearly ascertainable role were labelled as unclassified. the statistical significance of differences of repression and induction is described in additional file  <dig> 

the majority of sucrose-induced transcripts  were involved in protein synthesis/protein fate, nitrogen and sulphur metabolism, dna and rna processing, cell fate, development and biogenesis, and c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism. such effects of exogenous carbohydrates have been described in previous studies  <cit> .

the concurrent presence of atrazine and sucrose was associated with large induction of gene expression particularly related to cellular communication and signal transduction mechanism, detoxification and degradation of foreign compounds, oxidative stress responses, and protein degradation/cell aging . genes linked to detoxification and degradation of foreign compounds, oxidative stress response and cellular communication and signal transduction mechanism were thus largely induced in comparison with the atrazine alone or sucrose alone treatments, thus suggesting strong synergic effects of sucrose and atrazine on protection pathways. induction of dna/rna processing, nucleotide metabolism  and transcription  categories by sucrose plus atrazine was significantly higher than that by sucrose alone, and also contrasted with the significant repression of these categories in the atrazine alone treatment.

in order to distinguish induction or repression resulting from the effect of atrazine and sucrose combination, we used the comparison of mannitol-atrazine treatment against sucrose-atrazine treatment  for detecting expression variations resulting only from the effect of atrazine, and for expression variations resulting only from the effect of sucrose, we used the comparison of sucrose treatment and sucrose plus atrazine treatment . transcripts presenting a p-value >  <dig>   in these comparisons were subtracted from the list of  <dig> highly-responsive genes, and then all the genes whose expression was not modified by addition of atrazine in the presence of sucrose  and which were constant between the stress condition and the tolerance condition  were also removed. among the  <dig> resulting genes, thus largely controlled by the combination of atrazine and sucrose, only  <dig> genes were strongly downregulated  against  <dig> genes strongly upregulated . these data, which corroborated the venn diagram distribution , reinforced the idea of induction of specific stress tolerance mechanisms against the harmful effects of the atrazine treatment.

in order to identify relationships between sucrose- and atrazine-responsive genes, the  <dig> highly-responsive genes previously selected were subjected to hierarchical clustering  using euclidian distance for the similarity distance and the average linkage clustering for the linkage rule . this analysis classified genes into  <dig> clusters  according to their expression profiles for the  <dig> comparisons  described in methods. these  <dig> clusters were organised into  <dig> groups representative of specific patterns . for group i , the sa/ma comparison revealed no differential expression and was correlated to similar log <dig> for sa/m and ma/m comparisons with positive values for clusters e, h and o and negative for cluster l. group i included genes with similar expression for atrazine treatment in the presence or absence of sucrose, thus corresponding to loci principally regulated by atrazine. in contrast, group ii included genes with similar expression for sucrose or sucrose-atrazine treatment , thus corresponding to genes principally regulated by sucrose. indeed, these genes were not differentially expressed in the comparison sa/s and showed comparable log <dig> for the sa/m and s/m comparisons with positive log <dig> for cluster j and negative log <dig> for clusters b and c. group iii  comprised genes whose expression was repressed by atrazine alone  and induced by sugar alone  and for which the atrazine-sucrose combination  averaged expression values by balancing negative effects of atrazine and positive effects of sucrose. group iv  presented a similar behaviour to that of group iii but with opposite effects of sucrose alone and atrazine alone on gene expression. finally group v  exhibited high induction of expression by combined sucrose-atrazine treatment, which was not produced by additional effects of sucrose alone and atrazine alone. transcripts from that group seemed to be highly-induced specifically by sucrose-atrazine combination.

characterization of atrazine xenobiotic and oxidative effects: evidence for deleterious effects on gene regulation
genes showing large induction or repression of expression for atrazine treatment were principally ascribed to groups i, iii and iv . in a context of ros injury, atrazine induced some potentially adaptative responses , such as induction of an abc transporter  and a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family protein mate  involved in detoxification of glutathione-conjugated xenobiotics and their transport from cytoplasm to vacuole  <cit> . moreover, atrazine upregulated the glutathione-mediated system of methylglyoxal detoxification, which involves glyoxalase i  and putative glyoxalase ii   <cit> .

nde: not differentially expressed, genes with a bonferroni p-values higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described in lurin et al.  <cit> .

atrazine also upregulated pds <dig> transcripts , encoding a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase involved in biosynthesis of plastoquinones, tocopherols and carotenoids  <cit> , which are essential elements of photosynthetic electron transport chain and of antioxidative systems. the antioxidant properties of tocopherols arise from their ability to scavenge lipid peroxy radicals before they react with lipid substrates. carotenoids play a key role in protection of psii against photoinhibition, since they are able to quench 1o <dig> responsible for photooxidative damage  <cit> .

atrazine stress thus induced protective mechanisms that seemed to be partial and inefficient inasmuch as they did not eventually prevent plant death. moreover, analysis of atrazine treatment showed repression of numerous genes potentially important for xenobiotic or oxidative response , such as  the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme l-ascorbate peroxidase  <dig> apx <dig>  which belongs to the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and can scavenge oxygen free radicals, thereby minimising injury caused by oxidative stress  <cit> ,  glutathione s-transferases  atgstu <dig>  and atgstf <dig> , which are detoxifying enzymes present in all aerobic organisms and catalyse conjugation of glutathione  with a variety of electrophilic compounds, including triazines. gst isoforms presented different patterns of gene expression: some of them were largely repressed by atrazine whereas the concomitant presence of herbicide and sucrose resulted in a return to basal level observed in the presence of sucrose alone. this was the case for atgstf <dig>  which has been shown to be active both as a gst and as a glutathione peroxidase  <cit> .

nde: not differentially expressed, genes with a bonferroni p-values higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described in lurin et al.  <cit> .

the cytosolic methionine sulfoxide reductase b <dig> mrsb <dig>  was also downregulated by addition of atrazine. ros-mediated oxidation of methionine into methionine sulfoxide  is a major component of oxidative damage to proteins. methionine sulfoxide reductase  systems reduce meto to protect plant cells from cytotoxic effects and thereby prevent excessive accumulation of oxidized proteins and premature death during defence mechanisms  <cit> . vieira dos santos et al.  <cit>  showed that msrb protein amount increased after photooxidative stress, thus suggesting a role in the protection of cells against oxidative damage. vignols et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that thioredoxins  directly interact with msr in vivo and could then act as electron donor to msr proteins, thus suggesting the existence of a linked antioxidative mechanism. however, our results showed that transcripts of at2g <dig>  encoding a protein disulfide isomerase-like  protein, a member of a multigene family within the trx superfamily, were repressed by atrazine as observed for msrb <dig>  trx are involved in the regulation of cellular redox balance by reducing disulfide bridges, and in a large panel of mechanisms like defence, development and antioxidative responses  <cit> . meyer et al.  <cit>  suggested a crosstalk between trx and glutaredoxins, thus leading to a potential link between trx, glutathione and glutathione reductase. one of the proposed trx targets in arabidopsis is the apx <dig> protein  <cit> , whose transcripts were repressed in the presence of atrazine. in our analysis, all of these transcripts involved in xenobiotic and oxidative stress defence belonged principally to group iii  and were downregulated by atrazine, thus probably preventing their protective role.

all of these results strongly suggested a lack of an efficient anti-oxidative response in the presence of atrazine. moreover, atrazine treatment was associated with strong repression of genes involved in nucleic acid and protein dynamics . indeed, among the  <dig> highly-responsive genes selected for data analysis,  <dig> belonged to the protein dynamics category  and 60% of these genes were found to be downregulated by the herbicide. among the  <dig> genes involved in nucleic acids dynamics, 35% of transcripts were repressed by atrazine, whereas the sucrose/atrazine treatment induced about 40% of them.

other potentially negative effects of atrazine on plant cell physiology  involved repression of tubulin tua <dig>  transcription, or downregulation of expb <dig>  and exp <dig>  transcripts, which are involved in cell elongation. the mitochondrial nadh-cytochrome-b <dig> reductase  involved in electron transport through its oxidoreductase activity was negatively controlled by atrazine, which may thus hamper mitochondrial respiration. finally, the fkbp15- <dig> immunophilin , which has peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase  activity involved in protein folding processes, was repressed by atrazine, which may lead to inefficient protein conformations.

nde: not differentially expressed, genes with a bonferroni p-values higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described in lurin et al.  <cit> .

moreover, table  <dig> shows that, in presence of atrazine, an atp-dependent clp protease  was induced. clp proteases in chloroplasts degrade misfolded or unassembled proteins in an atp-dependent manner, in relation to the activity of molecular chaperones, in order to target specific polypeptide substrates and avoid inadvertent degradation of others  <cit> . accumulation of transcripts of clp protease is upregulated during several stresses  <cit> . moreover, genes involved in amino acid catabolism, such as at1g <dig>  encoding the 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme a carboxylase , at3g <dig>  encoding a isovaleryl-coa-dehydrogenase , and genes involved in nitrogen salvaging such as at5g <dig>  encoding glutamine synthetase gs <dig>  were upregulated during atrazine stress. their implication during protein degradation has been previously described  <cit> . this increase may reflect a situation of carbohydrate starvation  <cit> . however, other typical markers of carbohydrate starvation and autolysis regulation  <cit> , such as the at3g <dig> myb transcription factor , catalase  <dig>  and apg <dig> autophagy genes , did not respond to atrazine treatment, thus confirming that atrazine effects could not be primarily ascribed to carbohydrate starvation.

specific effects of combined sucrose plus atrazine treatment on tolerance-related gene regulation
previous studies have already described the transcriptomics of sugar treatment in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the sucrose-alone control treatment was therefore compared in detail with previous studies in order to detect any anomaly or specificity of the sucrose-treated plantlets used in the present study. our conditions of sucrose treatment resulted in modification of typical markers of carbohydrate responses in accordance with previous studies   <cit> . however, the observed gene expression modifications due to sucrose alone could not explain enhanced tolerance to atrazine, thus emphasising the importance of comparing sucrose-alone and sucrose plus atrazine treatments.

in group v, transcripts from cluster p  exhibited an expression pattern strongly suggesting specific regulation by sucrose-atrazine combination. only a small number of genes in this group have been functionally characterised in previous studies . thus, the type 2c protein phosphatase  has been described as aba-inducible and involved in aba signal transduction  <cit> . the hema <dig> gene , which is involved in heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis, was also highly-induced by sucrose plus atrazine treatment. the pattern of expression of hema <dig> may thus be related to maintenance and repair of chloroplasts in the presence of atrazine and sucrose.

nde: not differentially expressed, genes with a bonferroni p-values higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described in lurin et al.  <cit> .

among group v, cluster n  showed further evidence for specific effects of sucrose and atrazine interactions . this cluster contained genes encoding detoxifying enzymes like glutathione s-transferase atgstu <dig> . lacomme and roby  <cit>  demonstrated that expression of atgstu <dig> is induced in response to salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate and in response to avirulent pathogens causing a hypersensitive reaction. at5g <dig>  encodes an in2- <dig> protein that is induced in response to iron treatment  <cit> . however, analysis of at5g <dig> sequence shows the presence of two conserved domains corresponding, respectively, to the n- and c-terminal domains of glutathione s-transferase, thus suggesting a role of this gene in detoxification mechanisms. a pdc gene  encoding a pyruvate decarboxylase was induced by sucrose and to a much more higher level by the presence of sucrose plus atrazine. this at4g <dig> locus is highly-expressed during anoxia  <cit> , and exogenous sucrose, which enhances anoxia tolerance, correlatively increases at4g <dig> transcript accumulation. since induction of pdc genes has been described as a response to situations of abiotic stress leading to mitochondrial impairment  <cit> , the present induction of the at4g <dig> pdc gene may contribute to promote a back-up fermentative pathway that compensates mitochondrial impairment. indeed, we have shown above that atrazine injury was associated with downregulation of a mitochondrial nadh-cytochrome-b <dig> reductase , while a return to the basal level was observed under tolerance condition . the mitochondrial aox1a  is known to use excess reductant capacity of the cytochrome c oxidase pathway, thus preventing ros formation from an over-reduced ubiquinone pool  <cit> . aox1a is induced by sucrose alone and much more by atrazine plus sucrose, which may thus increase potential antioxidative properties of this detoxifying enzyme through the glyoxylate pathway.

the sucrose plus atrazine treatment induced more than 22-fold the expression of a cytochrome p <dig> cyp710a <dig> , responsible for a c <dig> desaturation reaction which produces stimasterol  <cit> , which may thus contribute to maintain proper sterol composition of membranes and associated cell functions.

a number of genes involved in abiotic stress response were upregulated by the sucrose-atrazine combination . two genes encoding aaa type atpases  presented an important induction. this large protein family is involved, via chaperone-like activity, in numerous cellular activities including membrane fusion, proteolysis, dna replication and repair, protein folding, and cytoskeletal regulation  <cit> . they were identified as highly upregulated after genotoxin application  <cit> , and may thus contribute to defence/stress response or cell cycle control. sucrose-atrazine treatment also activated a zinc finger tf  that is induced during senescence, pathogen infection and in the ozone-sensitive vtc <dig> mutant  <cit> . the embryo-abundant protein  induced by sucrose-atrazine treatment has been described as induced by uv-b irradiation and ozone fumigation  <cit> . the at5g <dig>  and at5g <dig>  genes, of unknown function, have been shown to be induced by cesium treatment in roots  <cit> .

differential expression of specific transcription factors during sucrose-induced atrazine tolerance
plant acclimation to atrazine treatment may be controlled by a complex network of regulatory genes. it is estimated that approximately 5% of genes in the genome of eukaryotic organisms encode transcription factors   <cit> . among our selection of  <dig> genes corresponding to 3-fold variation, about 8% belonged to tf category. in order to focus on genes potentially involved in tolerance response, only tfs highly-regulated by the sucrose-atrazine treatment were selected . among these tfs, two wrky tfs  and one ap <dig> domain-containing tf  have already been considered as hallmarks for the general oxidative stress response responding to a signal related to oxidative cellular damage  <cit> . sib <dig>  interacts with sibi, a protein with unknown function whose gene expression is tissue-specific, light-dependent, and developmentally-timed  <cit> . the bzip tf atbzip <dig>  was nearly exclusively induced by the sucrose-atrazine association. iwata and koizumi  <cit>  demonstrated that atbzip <dig> is induced by the endoplasmic reticulum  stress response  and may regulate expression of er chaperones. the zinc finger protein zat <dig> , which is also upregulated under tolerance condition, seems to play a central role in reactive oxygen and abiotic stress  signalling  <cit> . moreover, some results may suggest that zat <dig> is part of a transcriptional or signal transduction complex required for apx <dig> expression, essential to prevent oxidative stress  <cit> . another zinc finger tf , induced by sucrose alone and by sucrose-atrazine combination, is related to biotic stress response and to senescence  <cit> . the induction by sucrose-atrazine combination of ap <dig> tf , a putative dre2b , could also reflect its implication in stress response pathways. nakashima et al.  <cit>  had shown that dre2b gene was induced by dehydration and high salinity that generate oxidative stress in plant. other wrky tfs, such as at2g <dig> , were strongly induced by sucrose-atrazine combination. although these genes have not been specifically characterized, tfs of wrky family are generally able to recognize various motifs present in promoters of many defence-related genes, and they are often upregulated in response to various stresses, including infections by pathogens, wounding, and oxidative stress conditions  <cit> . they regulate various aspects of plant development and cell death connected with ros signalling events  <cit> .

nde: not differentially expressed, genes with a bonferroni p-values higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described in lurin et al.  <cit> .

the potential involvement of these tfs was further investigated by the research of cis-acting regulatory elements in promoters of genes presenting high induction by the sucrose-atrazine combination . identification of cis-acting regulatory elements was carried out using the atcisdb database  <cit> . the most repeated and frequent motifs found were cis-acting regulatory elements corresponding to the wrky, bzip, myb, and lfy tfs families . thus, the selected genes from group v , highly-responsive to sucrose-atrazine combination and potentially important for tolerance mechanisms, presented promoters with identified cis-acting regulatory elements corresponding to two of the tf families of table  <dig>  the wrky and bzip families.

in contrast, the myb and lfy cis-acting regulatory elements did not correspond to tfs described in table  <dig>  thus suggesting that these myb and lfy cis-elements may be regulated by tfs showing lower level of induction or expressed at earlier or later steps of the response. however, it was surprising that the identification of ap <dig> and zinc finger tfs in table  <dig> did not correspond to any cis-element in the promoters of group v genes. this may be due to the partial information contained in atcisdb database, where the binding sites of the seven ap <dig> and zinc finger genes of table  <dig> are not described, thus suggesting that these specific binding sites are significantly different from consensus cis-elements.

time-course of induction of transcription factors during sucrose-dependent atrazine protection
using expression angler with the atgenexpress stress set  <cit> , we selected, from table  <dig>  tfs which presented an expression pattern that was highly correlated  with that of genes potentially related to sucrose-induced atrazine protection, such as aox1a  or aaa type atpases . this analysis highlighted the potential importance of four genes encoding different families of tfs: zinc finger protein zat <dig> , bzip family protein atbzip <dig> , sigma factor binding protein sib <dig>  and ap <dig> domain-containing tf .

the importance of these tfs in the development of sucrose-induced tolerance was assessed by a time-course study . the results of this time-course analysis confirmed results of the catma microarray, thus constituting further validation of the experiment for these four additional genes. the protective sucrose plus atrazine medium induced the expression of these transcription factors whereas the atrazine treatment had little effect. this increase in expression in the presence of atrazine plus sucrose started as soon as  <dig> h for at5g <dig>  and at3g <dig> . the ap <dig> domain-containing tf expression level remained relatively high all along the time course, while at5g <dig> presented a constant increase of expression until  <dig> h. expression level of at1g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  increased steadily with a peak of expression after  <dig> h of treatment in the presence of sucrose and atrazine. conversely, the atrazine treatment repressed or did not modify gene expression relatively to the mannitol control, except at  <dig> h for at5g <dig> and at3g <dig> which presented a slight induction. these inductions during the first hours of sucrose plus atrazine treatment were consistent with an essential role of these tfs in the regulation of sugar-induced atrazine tolerance. it was also particularly interesting to identify early-induced genes such as at5g <dig> and at3g <dig> 

discussion
gene regulation was shown to be affected on a large scale by atrazine treatment, prior to the development of atrazine injury, in accordance with previous studies of exposure to other toxicants such as  <dig> -d  <cit>  or explosives  <cit> . moreover, a number of these gene expression effects , such as repression of ros defence mechanisms or repression of protein translation, were found to be potential components of atrazine sensitivity. this is, to our knowledge, the first report that atrazine can cause such large-scale primary and deleterious effects at the gene expression level.

in contrast, sucrose-induced atrazine-tolerance was characterized, on the one hand by the induction of several pathways linked to transcription, ros defence, cellular repair and protection, signal transduction, cellular communication, photosynthesis and unknown functions, and on the other hand by a return to basal level of atrazine-affected pathways . global analysis clearly showed that the transcriptome of arabidopsis plantlets under conditions of sucrose-atrazine treatment was not the mere addition of atrazine-dependent and of sucrose-dependent transcriptomes. thus, the number of genes specifically responding to sucrose-atrazine treatment amounted to nearly one third of all the genes that were differentially regulated under the sucrose plus atrazine treatment. the observed sucrose-atrazine transcriptome was therefore likely to depend on interacting signalling between sucrose and atrazine or between sucrose-derived and atrazine-derived, possibly ros-related, stimuli. soluble sugars have been involved in a number of stress-related processes, as metabolites that accumulate in response to stress conditions  <cit> , as substrates of carbon metabolism  <cit> , and as signals modifying gene expression  <cit> . whereas, in some situations such as carbohydrate starvation, glucose and sucrose appear to have similar effects on gene expression  <cit> , in some abiotic stress responses, such as response to anoxia  <cit> , synthesis of anthocyanins  <cit> , and response to psii herbicides  <cit> , sucrose treatment is more efficient than glucose treatment in providing protection mechanisms against the stress condition. these differential effects of glucose and sucrose greatly contrast with the similar effects of metabolisable sugars on the hexokinase-mediated signalling pathway  <cit> , and would therefore agree with the existence of hexokinase-independent sucrose-specific signalling pathways, which have been postulated  <cit> , but have remained elusive up to now, except for the characterization of a small number of transcription factors like the atb2-type subgroup of atbzip tfs  <cit> . in our study, sucrose-specific tfs showed patterns of mrna-level repression by sucrose alone, which were coherent with previous studies. thus, the atb2/atbzip factor, atbzip <dig> , was repressed by the sucrose treatment . such atb <dig> transcripts are subjected to sucrose-induced repression of translation, resulting in a low level of atb <dig> protein at  <dig> mm sucrose  <cit> . target genes of these atb <dig> tfs are expected to be specifically sucrose-responsive  <cit> .

interestingly, atrazine alone and the combined presence of sucrose and atrazine resulted in derepression of the sucrose-repressed atbzip <dig> transcription factor. the differences between the sucrose-atrazine and the individual sucrose transcriptomes were therefore strongly reflected at the level of tf gene expression. it thus seemed that development of tolerance response depended on sets of original tfs integrating signals from sucrose and from atrazine. the ability of atrazine to generate ros  <cit>  and the existence of ros-signalling pathways  <cit>  could suggest that atrazine-related signalling may involve ros signalling. moreover, our results  strongly suggest interactions with salicylate, aba and jasmonate signalling pathways. since abiotic stress situations seem to involve signalling interactions between sugar and ethylene  <cit> , it is therefore clear that the analysis of signalling pathways involved in sucrose-atrazine effects should use a panel of mutants affected not only in sugar signalling, but also in ethylene, salicylate, aba and jasmonate signalling.

since the initial ros generated by atrazine is 1o <dig>  <cit> , it may have been expected to observe similar gene expression modifications between atrazine treatment and the effects of the flu mutation, which results in higher 1o <dig> production upon dark/light shifts  <cit> . however, important differences were identified. for instance, the allene oxide synthase gene  , which is upregulated in the flu mutant, was strongly downregulated  in the atrazine treatment. these differences could be ascribed to differences of ros production and dynamics in terms of the chemical nature of generated ros, in terms of time-course of accumulation, or in terms of signal intensity, between the atrazine treatment and the flu mutation. however, since the overall effect of the atrazine treatment seemed to result in partial induction of some ros defence genes and in unexpected repression of other important ros defence genes  <cit> , such as the cytosolic apx <dig>  and allene oxide synthase , it was tempting to speculate that a xenobiotic signalling-pathway may exist. even though xenobiotic-related signalling pathways are strongly suspected to exist in plants  <cit> , none of them has yet been identified, in contrast with the detailed identification of xenobiotic receptors in animal cells. it would thus be interesting to investigate whether atrazine and other xenobiotics also develop their toxicity through signalling effects leading to the silencing or overcoming of ros stress defences. thus, the cytosolic apx <dig> , which is a central component of the ros gene network according to davletova et al.  <cit> , was the most significantly atrazine-repressed gene among the six genes of the apx family.

in contrast, under the situation of protection combining sucrose and atrazine, the most expressed gene was at2g <dig> , which corresponds to an expressed protein of unknown function, that has been found to be upregulated in most experiments of oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, tfs, which are strongly induced by atrazine plus sucrose, such as at3g <dig> , at2g <dig> , and at5g <dig> , have been described as common ros-upregulated tfs  <cit> . these three tfs were also significantly, but to a lesser extent, upregulated by sucrose alone. in other words, sucrose appeared to be useful in re-establishing the expression of tfs that may be important for ros defence. sucrose lifting of atrazine-mediated tf repression was apparently not sufficient to establish tolerance to atrazine, since other tfs were significantly enhanced by the combination of sucrose and atrazine. such is particularly the case for the at5g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  genes encoding respectively the zinc finger protein zat <dig> and atbzip <dig> . both these tfs are likely to be important for atrazine tolerance, since zat <dig> and atbzip <dig> have been respectively involved in the response to oxidative stress  <cit>  and in the regulation of endoplasmic stress response  <cit> . moreover, our results show that these genes were sequentially expressed in the course of the sucrose plus atrazine treatment , with zat <dig> induction preceding that of atbzip <dig> 

the set of tfs that is induced by the sucrose-atrazine treatment results in typical differential expression of multigene families that are involved in oxidative and xenobiotic stress responses, such as the gst multigene family. besides the effects on ros defence, sucrose treatment also allows plants to accumulate very high levels of atrazine in root and shoot tissues  <cit> . whereas complete mineralization of atrazine does not seem to occur in sucrose-treated plants, radiolabelling experiments strongly suggest that conjugation processes are likely to occur  <cit> . according to the different mechanisms described in higher plants, these processes could involve conjugation to glutathione, glucose or macromolecular cell wall components  <cit> . among the different pathways that may be involved in conjugation, the strongest differential effects of sucrose-atrazine treatment affected the p <dig> and gst multigene families, thus emphasising the importance of further work on the possibility of sucrose-induced atrazine-glutathione conjugation in arabidopsis. these mechanisms, which depend on gene induction, would facilitate atrazine accumulation, while hampering binding of free atrazine to psii, thus resulting in the observed maintenance of photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the comparison of the atrazine-induced stress situation and of the sucrose-atrazine protection situation through the transcriptomic approach therefore sheds a new light on xenobiotic-signalling pathways, on xenobiotic tolerance pathways, and in identifying novel xenobiotic tolerance pathways, that would have otherwise, in the presence of lethal concentrations of atrazine, remained cryptic.

the study of early tfs and target genes involved in sucrose-induced tolerance will therefore be useful to investigate whether sugar-induced tolerance towards other xenobiotics involves the same general mechanism. preliminary results indicate that sucrose can induce tolerance towards other xenobiotics.
