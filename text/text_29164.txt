BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi is a unicellular eukaryotic organism that causes a deadly condition referred to as chagas disease indigenous to central and south america. approximately 18- <dig> million people are infected with t. cruzi, with between  <dig>  and  <dig>  deaths per year due to chronic chagas disease. thirty-percent of patients infected show chronic stage chagas disease symptoms, including mega syndromes such as enlargement of the esophagus, colon or heart, or complications in the nervous system, ultimately causing death  <cit> . transmission of t. cruzi to humans occurs via a blood-sucking vector, the triatomine bug, a.k.a. the assassin bug, which is part of the reduviidae subfamily. as the triatomine takes a blood meal from the human host, the bug leaves behind t. cruzi-contaminated feces on the skin of the host. scratching of the wound causes self-infection, as t. cruzi enters the blood stream and replicates in macrophages, but eventually settles in smooth and cardiac tissues.

the members of the order trypanosomatida have a distinguishing factor: the kinetoplast. the kinetoplast is a disk-like structure that contains mitochondrial dna  in the form of dozens of maxicircles  and thousands of minicircles  in a catenated network with varying sizes depending on species  <cit> . the astounding process known as uridine insertion/deletion rna editing produces the dramatic alterations required to convert skeletal primary transcripts into functional messages through the post-transcriptional addition of up to half of the coding information. the editing process is directed by the largely minicircle-coded guide rnas  that specify the insertion or deletion of uridines within some of the maxicircle-encoded transcripts  <cit> .

the population structure of t. cruzi has been of great interest in the quest to link parasite genetics to clinical disease. the non-meiotic exchange of genetic information  <cit>  between the major lineages may have occurred only twice in the entire history of the species  <cit> , although more regular exchange among close relatives may provide a unique form of intra-strain copy correction  <cit> . currently six classes of t. cruzi groups are defined, termed discrete typing units   <cit>  and referred to as t. cruzi i-vi, or tci-vi  <cit> ; in this updated nomenclature, tci is the equivalent of dtu i, tcii of dtu iib, and tciii-vi of dtus iic, iia, iid and iie, respectively.

kinetoplast biology may play a direct role in disease and pathogenesis  <cit> . minicircles can integrate into the host genome  <cit> , with the potential to effect gene expression in host cells and trigger an autoimmune response. maxicircle gene deletions were associated with asymptomatic patients infected with t. cruzi  <cit> , although the correlation was not sustained  <cit> . both minicircles and maxicircles have been used as taxonomic markers  <cit>  in the effort to correlate specific strains with clinical manifestations, although the usefulness of the heterogeneous minicircles is debatable  <cit> .

the genealogical relationship of  <dig> t. cruzi strains was constructed using the  <dig> -kb maxicircle coii-ndi region, defining three clades, a, b and c, in which a and b form a monophyletic group, with a basal clade c  <cit> . the analysis of mitochondrial gene cyb in  <dig> t. cruzi strains also showed a similar pattern of clades and clade relationship  <cit> . the cl brener and esmeraldo strains, members of dtus tcvi and tcii, respectively, were the focus for whole genome shotgun sequencing  <cit> . using the sequence reads generated from both strains, complete maxicircle sequences for both esmeraldo and cl brener were assembled  <cit>  and the minicircle components analyzed  <cit> . the cl brener maxicircle is a representative of mitochondrial clade b, which includes strains from dtus tciii-vi, and the esmeraldo maxicircle a mitochondrial clade c exemplar. complete open reading frames , partial orfs, frame shifts, and genes with missing start codons are representative of the mitochondrial genes found on the maxicircle coding region, most of which are corrected at the transcript level by the rna editing process. strikingly, both of the t. cruzi maxicircles contain frameshifts in areas not usually subject to rna editing, with esmeraldo carrying a substantial deletion encompassing the 5' end of two opposing genes. these degenerations were attributed to the time the strains spent in laboratory culture, however the finding of the esmeraldo deletion in the human population  <cit>  indicates that maxicircle deletions are a normal part of maxicircle biology. speculation has begun as to how the cells survive with partial mitochondrial function due to the lack of complex i  <cit> ; the bioenergetic consequences are minimal in t. cruzi strains with compromised maxicircle genes  <cit> , consistent with survival of experimentally compromised t. brucei lines that demonstrate complex i participation in electron transport  <cit> .

to further examine t. cruzi maxicircles and better understand their genetic variation, we amplified and sequenced the coding region of a clade a/dtu tci representative sylvio x <dig> to compare and contrast gene synteny and content. comparison of non-edited genes and 5'-edited genes showed functional genes in sylvio x <dig> and cl brener that are mutated in esmeraldo. analysis of the three clades showed strain specific insertion/deletion mutations and small nuclear polymorphisms in both edited and non-edited regions. the high variance within the edited genes in particular may be a fertile source of taxonomic markers to further understand the mitochondrial dna evolution and rna editing in t. cruzi and other kinetoplastids.

RESULTS
conserved synteny among the three clades
the three maxicircle coding regions from the three clade taxon representatives sylvio x <dig> , cl brener  and esmeraldo  were syntenic beginning with the 12s rrna gene and ending with the nd <dig> gene . comparing the coding region sequence lengths beginning at the 12s rrna and ending near the 3' end of nd <dig> at the equivalent nucleotide sequence for the three maxicircles, sylvio x <dig> has  <dig>  bp, cl brener has  <dig>  bp, and esmeraldo has the shortest coding region of  <dig>  bp. only dtu tcii strain esmeraldo shows a 236-nt deletion at the 5' end of the cr <dig> and nd <dig> genes, although this deletion is not characteristic of the dtu  <cit> ; otherwise, the lengths of the coding regions were comparable for individual genes among the three strains. the sylvio x <dig> nd <dig> gene is incomplete due to the absence of conserved sites for oligonucleotide placement within the adjacent maxicircle divergent region, and ~ <dig> nt of the anticipated ~ <dig> nt were sequenced.

a major revision is included in the annotation of the murf <dig> gene for the cl brener and esmeraldo strain maxicircles. whereas murf <dig> is described as 5' edited and 147- <dig> nt in length, the corrected identification is for a non-edited gene of 261- <dig> nt, depending on the strain. the gene sequence is provided in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  along with the predicted translation in alignment including the t. brucei predicted protein. murf <dig> was notable for the relatively high number of insertion/deletion  mutations throughout the gene, disrupting the open reading frames at the carboxyl-terminus in cl brener and esmeraldo.

evolutionary relationship between the clade coding regions
phylogenetic analysis was performed using the three t. cruzi clades and the t. brucei and l. tarentolae maxicircles spanning the 12s rrna gene through the partial nd <dig> gene from sylvio x <dig> . clades a and b formed a monophyletic group to the exclusion of lineage c in a neighbor joining  tree rooted by l. tarentolae. the a and b clades are supported by 100% of the bootstrap replicates, offering significant statistical support for this branching order among clades a, b and c. the tree topology supports previous phylogenetic analyses using either coii-ndi or cyb genes  <cit> .

the relationship between clades a and b validates the model that a dtu tci strain contributed to the genetic make-up of the heterozygous hybrid dtus tcv and tcvi. in our genealogy tci is a 'grandparent' of the heterozygous hybrids, and the maxicircle genome was passed down through a homozygous hybrid tciii strain  <cit> .

maxicircle-encoded grna in sylvio complements cl brener
a predicted grna gene was found in the sylvio x <dig> maxicircle at positions 11764- <dig> . an equivalent grna from the cl brener maxicircle is located between the genes for cr <dig> and nd <dig> at positions 11744- <dig> in the intergenic region, containing the information to direct the rna editing of the murf <dig> gene  <cit> . the sylvio x <dig> maxicircle grna overlaps the start codon of the nd <dig> gene; the post-transcriptionally added poly tail could provide the base pairing downstream of the grna coding region for both.

along the 41-nt length of the predicted grna gene, six transitions differentiate the sylvio x <dig> and cl brener grna genes. due to the permissive nature of the grna-mrna interaction, the two grnas impart identical editing information, although the 8-bp anchor region that provides the initial interaction between the partially edited mrna and the grna in cl brener is less stable due to the presence of two wobble pairs. the esmeraldo maxicircle murf <dig> grna is lost in the 236-nt cr4/nd <dig> deletion  <cit> ; a second cl brener maxicircle grna was found downstream of the nd <dig> gene, beyond the region sequenced for sylvio x <dig> 

average percent identities among clades a, b, and c
the percent identities for the coding and intergenic regions and the non-edited proteins were calculated using the global alignment feature in bioedit  <dig> . <dig> by pairwise comparisons of the three clades . for this analysis, each category of sequence was assembled into a single file for each strain to generate an overall percentage of identity. minor differences were seen at this level among the three clades in the rrna or protein-coding genes or for the predicted translations of the non-edited genes, although there is a bias toward a closer relationship between clade a and clade b. the combined intergenic regions showed a wider differentiation among the strains, with clades a and b showing the higher levels of identity. indel corrections were not made for any strain prior to the comparisons, and the absence of an entire intergenic region in esmeraldo was likewise not compensated in the other strains. thus, the equivalent comparisons using strains with intact maxicircles may show higher levels of identity among the protein sequences in particular.

single nucleotide indels in two non-edited regions of sylvio x10
the presence of indels outside of regions anticipated to be edited relative to the cl brener maxicircle implied that esmeraldo was degenerate in at least five genes  <cit> . while the functional implications for mitochondrial biology are unclear, the maxicircle coding region of esmeraldo is useful for taxonomic purposes. in the sylvio x <dig> coding region, two genes showed indels in their nucleotide sequences that created early stop codons.

the cytochrome b  gene produces a transcript that is 5'-end edited. this 1080-bp gene contained intact reading frames downstream of the presumptive edited region in cl brener and esmeraldo, but contained an extra thymidine at nucleotide  <dig> in the sylvio x <dig> sequence  that resulted in an early stop codon at amino acid  <dig> . an intact  <dig> amino acid orf is found in cl brener and esmeraldo, and deletion of the extra nucleotide in sylvio x <dig> restored a conserved orf through the carboxyl-terminus of the protein .

the nd <dig> gene produces transcripts that do not require editing in cl brener, however in sylvio x <dig> this gene contained a single nucleotide insertion at position  <dig>  that created an early stop codon at position  <dig> in the predicted amino acid sequence . when the nucleotide was deleted manually in the sylvio x <dig> sequence, the nd <dig> transcript can be translated into a complete orf similar to that of cl brener . the esmeraldo gene contains a major deletion of the 5'-end of the first  <dig> nts, however the remaining sequence showed conservation of the nd <dig> coding information.

for both cyb and nd <dig>  the relatively high levels of sequence identity flanking the sylvio x <dig> indels indicated that the overall selective pressure to carry a functional gene is present. the same is true of the compromised gene sequences found in cl brener and esmeraldo. indeed, the indels found in all three genomes point to the poor quality of maxicircle replication, and beg the question of how genome integrity is maintained.

snp analysis supports the clade a-clade b relationship
comparative analysis of maxicircle protein coding genes with little or no rna editing and their predicted amino acid sequences showed different indels and unique snps among the three clades . for the alignments used in this analysis, the basic rules that apply to extensively edited genes were used: namely, pyrimidines and purines were scored as functional equivalents. thus, where an alignment program would introduce an indel where a c and t fell, it was scored as a snp rather than an indel for this analysis. for the purposes of amino acid comparison, any internal frameshifts were compensated for prior to protein alignment.

*for region beyond esmeraldo 5' deletion; translation includes correction of frameshift in sylvio

**through available sylvio sequence, ~ <dig> of ~ <dig> nts; esmeraldo translation corrected for frameshifts

the prevalence of snps varied between  <dig> % and 14% among this subset of genes. a total of  <dig> aa changes resulted from  <dig> snps, revealing that one in six nucleotide mutations resulted in an alteration of amino acid sequence and supporting presence of a selective pressure to maintain the primary protein identity. in contrast to the snp distribution, the frequency of amino acid alterations varied among the genes within a range of  <dig> % for coi to  <dig> % for the analyzed portion of the nd <dig> gene. the presence of indels in specific genes correlated with the nonviable mutations in each strain. the esmeraldo maxicircle carried the greatest number of indels in this category of gene, with  <dig> in murf <dig>   <dig> in murf <dig>   <dig> in murf <dig>   <dig> in nd <dig>  and  <dig> in the partial sequence of nd <dig>  the presence of indels in cyb and nd <dig> in sylvio x <dig> leave only nd <dig>  coi and coii in functional condition in all three maxicircles among the genes requiring no or minimal editing of their transcripts; the extensively edited genes cannot be judged as easily.

the addition of the sylvio x <dig> murf <dig> gene to the alignments altered the previous annotations of the cl brener and esmeraldo murf <dig> genes  <cit> , extending their sequences by over  <dig> nt each and revealing frameshifts in both at the extreme 3' end of the genes. the resulting orf is conserved with the t. brucei murf <dig> gene, lending confidence to the analysis . the murf <dig> gene displayed a high number of deletions for its relatively small size, with a trio of three-nt frame shifts in the front half of the gene that may be acceptable for protein function. in the sylvio x <dig> maxicircle, the 3' end of murf <dig> overlapped with the first  <dig> nt of the adjacent nd <dig> gene, which is transcribed in the same orientation. thus, the frameshifts in cl brener and esmeraldo that throw the termination codon out of frame may result in longer proteins that are still functional. the conservation of primary nucleotide sequence at the 3' end of the genes indicates that the sylvio x <dig> frame represents the biologically relevant reference.

at both the cumulative levels of snps and of amino acid changes, the linkage between clades a and b was the most pronounced, although not always significant for any particular individual gene. the variability of amino acid replacement for each gene product may reflect the biological tolerance to change as selected by function.

extensively edited genes contain abundant thymidine indels
a similar comparative analysis was performed at the nucleotide level for the extensively edited gene set, emphasizing the snp and indel variability relative to clade . due to the primary sequence variability afforded to these genes by the rna editing process, standard sequence alignments were not particularly useful, and alignments were performed by eye. for some genes, the actual rna editing patterns from t. cruzi or, in the absence of the t. cruzi edited sequence, t. brucei were included for comparison.

*beginning after the esmeraldo deletion

the coiii gene illustrated the dramatic effect of rna editing on the primary sequences among the strains . although the snp pattern within these genes were not strong differentiators, the indel patterns were revealing in their associations. a comparison of indels was performed for the coiii gene, revealing  <dig> shared indels between clades a and b, eight between clades b and c, and five for clades a and c. due to the unique mechanism of the uridine insertion/deletion rna editing process, indels involving thymidine residues would be tolerated with a wide degree of latitude. the association of the indel patterns with particular clades cannot be assessed without a broad survey of t. cruzi strains, and the permissive nature of the process may prove too accommodating to provide useful taxonomic information. given the abundance of indels detected among the three clade representatives relative to the size of their respective coding regions, candidate genes for broader indel analysis emerged, including coiii, nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> 

taken individually each gene showed a wide range of associations among the three clades when considering snp variability, however the sum total of these differences revealed the bias toward the clade a/b relationship. the number of indels surpassed the snps substantially, making them provocative markers for these genes.

non-edited genes have higher evolutionary pressure to remain intact when indels cannot be corrected by rna editing. the indels in areas typically free of rna editing are summarized for the three clades ; this schematic differs from a previous incarnation  <cit>  in that the sylvio x <dig> indels have been added, along with several additional indels for esmeraldo, and genes judged not to be edited in t. brucei and l. tarentolae despite the absence of canonical start codons are marked accordingly.

discussion
the majority of the coding region for t. cruzi strain sylvio x <dig>  a dtu tci/mitochondrial clade a representative, was sequenced to complete the maxicircle trilogy first defined by machado and ayala . the close association between the sylvio x <dig> and cl brener coding regions supports a model in which an ancestor strain of dtu tci provided the maxicircle to the progeny of a tci-tcii hybridization event, resulting in the generation of dtus tciii and tciv  <cit> ; a subsequent 'back-cross' hybridization between tcii and tciii strains resulted in the tcv and tcvi strains that carry the maxicircle from their tciii/clade b ancestor  <cit> . the percent identity of clades a and b is the highest across comparisons of rrna sequences, edited and non-edited genes, amino acid and intergenic regions when compared to the percent identity of clades b and c. the pedigree of the maxicircles provides strong evidence of the parental contribution of dtu tci in the first fusion event in the genesis of the extant t. cruzi population structure. in order to generate useful markers for taxonomic purposes, additional representatives of all clades must be integrated into the analysis; with the complete genome sequencing of other key t. cruzi strains in process, the usefulness of the maxicircle will be clarified in the coming years. to better understand the genesis of the extant clades, maxicircles from dtu tciii are of particular interest as the kdna donor to the nuclear heterogeneous hybrid lines in dtus tcv and tcvi.

perhaps the most striking finding in the study of t. cruzi maxicircles is that genes producing transcripts that are not anticipated to be rna edited in all three strains are compromised in terms of sequence content. the t. cruzi clade representatives have the same gene order in the coding region with different number and location of indels and snps. early stop codons are created by indels in the cyb and nd <dig> genes of sylvio x <dig>  in the murf <dig> and nd <dig> genes of esmeraldo, and in the murf <dig> gene of cl brener; in addition, the esmeraldo maxicircle has a 236-bp deletion affecting the opposing cr <dig> and nd <dig> genes, including the deletion of a grna in the intergenic region, and four individual indels in the murf <dig> gene. the 5'-edited gene cyb and the non-edited nd <dig> found in sylvio x <dig> have indels that result in early termination codons that, when adjusted manually, result in conserved orfs, a general characteristic of all the non-edited region indels. the absence of drift in the sequences downstream of the indels suggests that they are relatively recent. the commonality of affected genes, murf <dig> in cl brener and esmeraldo and nd <dig> in esmeraldo and sylvio x <dig>  may reflect a hierarchy of tolerable genes for functional loss. given the ability of the rna editing mechanism to overcome frameshifts, transcripts from all of the compromised genes must be sequenced. with only two non-edited genes unscathed in any of the three genomes, specifically coi and nd <dig>  the functional necessity of these genes versus their fortuitous exclusion from indel mutation will be clarified with the sequencing of additional maxicircles. the mechanism for the maintenance of these extra-nuclear sequences thus becomes an interesting challenge for the organism. intriguing suggestions of mitochondrial fusion in the hybridization process may provide the answer  <cit> , as maxicircles could share content information across a heterogeneous population and a form of intercellular copy correction; the occurrence of the fusion event within strains would have to be frequent, whereas a combining of two disparate strains, such as would be required to produce one of the genetic hybrid lines, would be exceedingly rare.

the extensively-edited genes from the sylvio x <dig>  cl brener and esmeraldo strains show that clades a and b share the most snps, followed by clades b and c have the second highest and clades a and c having the fewest shared snps. although the gene sequence may vary in the number of thymidines, rna editing will insert or delete the correct number of uridines to create orfs that can be translated to produce a functional protein. each strain has its unique number of indels and snps, and comparison of sylvio x <dig> and cl brener shows their close association in comparison to cl brener and esmeraldo by this criterion as well.

phylogenetic analysis of the t. cruzi population through the use of microsatellite data has given rise to a different postulated inheritance of the maxicircle genomes, in which clade b  is the mitochondrial donor of hybrid dtus tcv/vi  <cit> . the maxicircle genealogy shows clade a  as the mitochondrial donor of hybrid dtus tcv/vi  <cit> . maxicircle coding region comparison of the three clade representatives shows that cl brener, a dtu tcvi, is associated with the clade a sylvio x <dig> strain rather than the clade c esmeraldo strain. therefore, the maxicircle was donated from dtu tciii, an ancient hybrid that inherited its maxicircle from tci  <cit> .

with the maxicircle sequence available for clade b and c representatives and the majority of the coding region sequenced for clade a representative now complete, further phylogenetic analysis can better define the t. cruzi population structure by comparing the editing patterns across the three strains, or sequencing additional maxicircles to see if the similar snp and indel patterns are followed within clades. the three-clade scheme was based on the two non-edited genes coii and nd <dig>  <cit> . use of the extensively edited genes for comparison across strains from each clade might result in a more refined clade scheme as compared to the phylogenetic relationship observed from maxicircle non-edited genes, and provide further insight into the t. cruzi population structure. alternatively, edited gene indels may behave as microsatellites and prove useful for recent changes in population structure, but be unhelpful for larger analyses.

the existence of complex i involved in electron transfer from nadh to coenzyme q in trypanosomes has been debated due to the viability of trypanosomes with or without a functional complex i in varying environments and strains  <cit> . a viable strain without a functional complex i is the uc strain l. tarentolae  <cit> . some trypanosoma strains can survive with a partial maxicircle, or even with complete loss of kdna. trypanosoma brucei relatives such as t. equiperdum and t. evansii are examples that showed gradual reduction or loss of kinetoplastid dna  <cit> . t. equiperdum has a partial kdna and t. evansi no longer has kdna, and survive only in the bloodstream stage dependant on glycolysis and down-regulation of the mitochondria  <cit> . the ability of t. brucei strains to find a biological niche for parasitism that frees them from the insect life stages demonstrates the versatility of the kinetoplastids, and may apply equally to t. cruzi.

analysis of the sylvio x <dig> maxicircle points to a dtu tci strain as the mitochondrial donor to hybrid dtus tciii/iv, and strengthens our understanding of the clade structure and evolution of t. cruzi. with sequencing becoming ever more affordable and accurate  <cit>  we will be able to sequence the mitochondrial maxicircle from representatives of each dtu and re-evaluate the three-clade scheme to redefine or further confirm the population structure as well as uncover markers for strains and clades to better understand chagas disease.

CONCLUSIONS
with the promise of additional maxicircle genome sequences on the horizon  <cit> , extensive studies will be possible, allowing the quantification of the preliminary observations made with the three clade representatives used here. the use of extensively edited genes as useful taxonomic markers provides a leap beyond the standard mitochondrial dna, long favored due to its rapid accumulation of mutations. the flexibility afforded by the uridine addition and deletion process may prove to be too high for broad phylogenetic conclusions. the unusual genetic exchange mechanism employed by t. cruzi must also be taken into account, as the frequency of this event and its participants are not yet clear. indeed, the relative lack of diversification within mitochondrial clade b, encompassing both the nuclear homozygous and heterozygous hybrid strains, is surprising, and remains to be examined within the clade.
