BACKGROUND
microbial source tracking  is important to trace the source of a pathogen in an outbreak situation. pulsed field gel electrophoresis  is one of the tools for mst and is the method of choice for a number of bacterial pathogens as it is highly discriminative, reproducible  <cit>  and standardized protocols are available. however, certain bacterial species such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and many more are susceptible to dna degradation, resulting in smeared dna, which can be improved by the addition of thiourea into the pfge running buffer  <cit> . the dna degradation phenotype  was first observed during an electrophoretic separation of dna of a gram-positive bacterium, streptomyces lividans  <cit> . a dna modification system  was then found to be responsible for the dnd phenotype by mediating the incorporation of sulphur into the dna backbone via a process called phosphorothioation  <cit> . the dna modification renders the dna susceptible to cleavage by peracetic acid generated during a pfge run  <cit> . while the 5-gene cluster  is found in bacteria across different families , enterobacteriaceae including e. coli only harbour a 4-gene dndbcde operon, lacking the dnda gene. iscs, a cysteine desulfurase, which has a similar function as dnda was then identified in e. coli to support dna phosphorothioation  <cit> .

dnd operons are often located in chromosomal islands, where highly diverse genetic contexts were observed across different bacterial species  <cit> . however, there is dearth of studies on the diversity of the dnd-encoding gis from the same bacterial species. to date, only one dnd-encoding genomic island has been described for the enteric pathogen salmonella enterica  <cit> . a more distantly related bacterium, mycobacterium abscessus, was reported to have conserved regions flanking their dnd-encoding gis but the description of the dnd-encoding gis itself was not available  <cit> . the lack of data regarding the genetic environment of dnd operons makes comprehensive comparative analysis between the same and different bacterial species difficult. although there are ample bacterial genome sequences in the public domain, comparative studies on the dnd clusters of e. coli are still lacking. in this study, we aimed to  improve the typeability of e. coli affected by dna degradation ;  investigate the genetic diversity of dnd+e. coli strains using pfge;  develop a pcr assay to detect the dnd operons in dnd+e. coli;  determine the association between the presence of the dnd operon and the dnd phenotype;  determine the genetic diversity and genetic environment of dnd operons;  investigate the background of e. coli harbouring dnd operons. the outcome of the study may provide further insights into the diversification of dnd operons in e. coli.

RESULTS
addition of thiourea improved the typeability of dnd+ strains by 100%
without the addition of thiourea to the pfge run, all  <dig> dnd+e. coli strains from previous studies  <cit>  yielded degraded dna despite repeated attempts  , lanes s1-b2). however, when thiourea was added to the running buffer, there was a 100% marked improvement in typeability for all the e. coli strains , lanes s1-b2). strains with blni-digested chromosomal dna were also typeable when thiourea was added in the pfge run . seven zoonotic vtec strains  and two clinical strains  shared two indistinguishable pulsotypes  ) while another  <dig>  were genetically different.figure  <dig>

sequence analysis of dndb-e genes and association of the dna degradation phenotypes and genotypes
pcr detection of dndc gene using primers described previously  <cit>  revealed that out of  <dig> dnd+e. coli strains, only  <dig> zoonotic vtec  and  <dig> clinical  dnd+ strains were positive for the dndc gene. another  <dig> dnd+ strains  were negative for the dndc gene and these strains were obtained from the same medical center and source. the failure to amplify the dndc gene from  <dig> out  <dig> dnd+ strains using previously described primers  <cit>  prompted us to develop a pcr assay targeting the internal regions of dndb, dndc, dndd, and dnde based on the dndbcde dna sequences of e. coli available in dnddb  <cit> . all  <dig> dnd+ strains yielded the expected pcr amplicons for all  <dig> genes  . all dnd− strains  that did not display degradation phenotype were negative for the dnd genes. significant correlation was also found between the presence of the dnd gene cluster and the dnd phenotype .table  <dig>

at least two sets of the amplified dndb-dnde genes from different strains with a similar pulsotype were sequenced. it was found that the dndb-dnde genes from different strains with the same pulsotype shared identical  nucleotide sequences. multiple sequence alignment  of the nucleotide sequences of the dndb-dnde genes with e. coli se <dig>   <dig> and b7a were also carried out. using e. coli  <dig> as reference, the pairwise alignments showed that e. coli s1-s <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> shared dndb-e sequences that are highly similar to e. coli  <dig> . strains a <dig> and a <dig> harboured identical dnd genes but are different from e. coli  <dig> . the dndb-e sequences of strain a <dig> are most distantly related to those of e. coli  <dig>  but are highly similar to e. coli b7a  . hence, the inability to amplify the dndc genes using primers described previously  <cit>  for strain a1-a <dig> might be due to the diversity in the sequences of the dnd operons in various e. coli strains. further in silico analysis also revealed that mismatches at the primer priming sites  were found for e. coli  <dig>  se <dig> and b7a. however, it should be noted that primers described by wang et al.,   <cit>  were for the expression studies of the dnd operon from salmonella enterica . furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no other appropriate primers available for the detection of the dndbcde gene cluster in e. coli. it should also be noted that the dna sequences of the dndb-e genes included in the msa are partial cds. the dna sequences of dndb-dnde genes from each pulsotype have been deposited in genbank under accession nos. kj702391-kj <dig> 

pcr detection of iscs revealed that all e. coli , salmonella spp. and shigella strains were positive for the iscs gene. in fact, iscs is also found in citrobacter spp., klesiella spp., and morganella spp. using blastn indicating that this cysteine desulfurase gene may be ubiquitous in different enterobacterial strains, thus supporting its suggested importance in sustaining fundamental life processes  <cit> . however, this also indicates that the presence of the iscs gene is not a good genotypic marker for the dnd+ phenotype. representative iscs sequence obtained from this study have been deposited in genbank under accession no kc <dig> 

dnd operons from different bacterial genera were grouped into separate distinct clusters
a total of  <dig> positive hits  were obtained from both databases of non-redundant nucleotide collection  and whole genome shotgun contigs  using the three dnd operons  as queries. all three queries also yielded the same number of positive hits including genomes from other species from enterobacteriaceae besides e. coli, including serratia spp., erwinia spp. and citrobacter spp.. only  <dig> out of  <dig> dnd operons were included in the comparative analysis because the remaining dnd operons were located in the gaps of their respective draft genomes and were thus, incomplete. the accession numbers of all  <dig> genomes with positive hits were summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> which also included the e. coli strain background information.

a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the multiple sequence alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the  <dig> dnd operons . all dnd sequences from salmonella spp.  and erwinia amylovora  were grouped into two distinct separate clusters. on the other hand, the dnd sequences from the genomes of other enterobacteriaceae such as citrobacter spp., cronobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. were generally not clustered into any groups . as for e. coli ,  <dig> out of  <dig> of them were grouped together into one main cluster. the remaining  <dig> were placed at different nodes. another phylogenetic tree was constructed using the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> dnd operons  together with their respective immediate vicinity   to determine whether the immediate genetic environment will cause any changes to the phylogenetic tree. surprisingly, both trees  yielded highly similar results with only slight differences. for example, cronobacter turicensis z <dig> is more closely related to enterobacter mori lmg  <dig>  than to dickeya dadantii  <dig> by comparing their dnd operons only . on the other hand, cronobacter turicensis z <dig> is more closely related to salmonella enterica strains when the dnd operons and their respective immediate vicinity were included in the analysis . overall, both trees yielded similar results.figure  <dig>

based on the sequence similarity of the immediate upstream and downstream regions  of the  <dig> dnd operons of e. coli, a total of  <dig> subgroups were further identified. the  <dig> subgroups were designated a, b, ci, cii, d, e and f and were included in figure  <dig>  it was observed that genomes harbouring highly conserved dnd operons also shared similar immediate genetic environments and vice versa. of the  <dig> subgroups identified, groups ci and cii share similar immediate downstream but different upstream regions while all other groups were very different with respect to their immediate genetic environment. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> dnd operons from e. coli genomes belonged to two e. coli draft genomes . msa analysis revealed that the two copies of the dnd operon and their associated genetic environment in the same e. coli genome are different and are distantly located from each other in the phylogenetic tree generated  .

upstream and downstream regions of  <dig> dnd+e. coli strains resemble three different types of genetic environment
pcr detection of the immediate upstream and downstream regions of the dnd operon for the  <dig> dnd+e. coli strains revealed three types of immediate genetic environment. strains s1-s <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> shared dnd operons with associated genetic environment similar to group a; a <dig> and a <dig> to cii; and a <dig> to group f. all three types of immediate genetic environment identified in the dnd+e. coli strains using pcr matched to those determined by in silico analysis, indicating that there were only  <dig> types of different immediate genetic environment identified to date for e. coli.

diverse dnd-encoding genomic islands were observed for various representative e. coli genomes
a genome from each of the seven subgroups determined by the sequence similarity of their respective immediate genetic environment was selected for further genomic analysis. only  <dig> genome was selected from each subgroup because it was impossible to determine all complete gis carrying the dnd operon as most of the genomes in the public database were partially sequenced. all  <dig> dnd operons from the selected e. coli genomes were found to be associated with gis. the  <dig> dnd-encoding gis were then designated based on the naming system described in the methods section. thus, the dnd-encoding gi located in e. coli  <dig>  was designated “dndi_iec 55989”; koege  <dig>  acyxm- supercont <dig> .c <dig>  as “dndi_iec koege 7”; koege  <dig>  acyxt-supercont <dig> .c <dig>  as “dndi_iec koege 118”; umea 3200- <dig> acywy- supercont <dig> .c <dig>  as “dndi_iec umea 3200-1”; se <dig>  as “dndi_iec se11”, kte <dig> acasr-supercont <dig> .c <dig>  as “dndi_iiec kte 9” and umea 3176- <dig> acyyh-supercont <dig> .c <dig>  as “dndi_iec umea 3176-1”. the genetic maps of the  <dig> types of dnd-encoding gis are illustrated in figure  <dig>  based on the genetic maps of the  <dig> dnd-encoding gis, it was found that the genetic contents of the gis harbouring the dnd operons were variable  although all the gis described were obtained from e. coli. this indicates the potential contribution of gis to the evolution and diversification of closely related bacteria. all  <dig> dnd-encoding gis were also associated with trna and integrase genes . further exploration of the genetic environment revealed the presence of three conserved genes , found upstream of the dnd operons, where both gene clusters were often separated by  <dig> to  <dig> hypothetical proteins . the three conserved genes were found in the vicinity of the dnd operon of all e. coli genomes included in the msa analysis using blastn with the exception of strains e. coli c496_ <dig> and e. coli o <dig> where only draft genomes were available. thus, we could not be certain if these genes were absent or they were lost in the gaps of the incomplete genome sequences.figure  <dig>

e. coli koege  <dig> and kte  <dig> harboured  <dig> copies of dnd operons each, and all were associated with gis as well. the dnd-encoding gis in koege  <dig> were designated dndi_iec koege  <dig>  and dndi_iiec koege  <dig>  whereas in kte <dig>  they were designated dndi_iec kte  <dig>  and dndi_iiec kte  <dig>  with their genetic maps depicted in figure  <dig>  interestingly, both dndi_iec koege  <dig> and dndi_iec kte <dig> are identical whereas dndi-iiec kte <dig> is identical to dndi-iiec koege  <dig>  but dndi-iiec koege  <dig> had an additional  <dig> kb segment containing a type vi secretion system  that was absent from dndi-iiec kte <dig> . thus, in terms of the dnd operon and its immediate genetic vicinity, both dndi_iiec koege  <dig> and dndi_iiec kte  <dig> were grouped within the same group e . it should be noted that not all genomes from the same subgroup shared identical gis as they are often very large in size, and variation may have occurred within the gis caused by other mobile genetic elements  <cit> .

dnd-encoding genomic islands displayed mosaic structures
due to the great diversity of the islands harbouring dnd operons, three representative islands from e. coli strains b7a,  <dig> and koege  <dig> belonging to different groups  were selected for further investigation to determine the evolutionary forces driving the great variation between the dnd-encoding gis. based on the gc content , the dnd-encoding gis displayed mosaic structures and can be separated into several modules. further examination on the presence of orfs from the dnd-encoding gis in other e. coli genomes further supported their mosaic characteristics. the dnd modification systems, dpt restriction systems, together with the hypothetical proteins in between the two systems were collectively found associated with dnd-positive genomes only . on the other hand, majority of the orfs outside the dpt- and dnd-clusters are present in both dnd-positive and dnd-negative e. coli genomes , with the exception of an integrase gene  and  <dig> orfs at the immediate upstream of dnd operon in koege <dig>  which are found associated with dnd-positive genomes only. intriguingly, some hypothetical proteins are strain-specific, which can be observed in e. coli strain  <dig> .

different genetic contents were identified at the leu trna insertion sites of dnd-negative and dnd-positive e. coli genomes
all dnd-encoding gis determined in our study were associated with trna, an integration hotspot in bacterial genomes  <cit> . this prompted us to investigate the genetic contents at the same trna gene site  in dnd-negative e. coli genome. the trna insertion sites of four genomic regions  from e. coli strains cft <dig>  umea 3176- <dig> , b7a and  <dig> were compared . upstream flanking regions of the genomic islands which were inserted into the leu trna gene sites for all  <dig> e. coli genomes are highly conserved, indicating similar upstream backbone . while a  <dig>  kb non-dnd-encoding gi  was found attached to the leu trna gene site of e. coli cft <dig>  the similar attachment sites in e. coli strains b7a, umea 3176- <dig> and  <dig> were occupied with dnd-encoding island of variable sizes . the downstream flanking regions of genomic islands for dnd-negative  and dnd-positive  genomes are also conserved , indicating that the leu trna gene site in e. coli is a variable region with other types of gis found in dnd-negative strains. despite the highly conserved upstream and downstream flanking regions for dnd-encoding gis for e. coli strain umea 3176- <dig> and b7a, slight variations within the highly similar gis were still observed with transposases found in the variable regions .

discussion
pfge is often regarded as the “gold standard” for subtyping e. coli. however, dnd+e. coli strains that were untypeable from our previous studies yielded incomplete molecular epidemiological data. the addition of thiourea to the pfge running buffer has enabled us to overcome the untypeable problem of all  <dig> dnd+e. coli strains. in our study, 9/ <dig> dnd+ strains were represented by two distinctly different pulsotypes  , suggesting that the dnd+ phenotype might be an inherent clonal trait for strains with the two respective pulsotypes. no dnd− strains were found to share similar pulsotypes with the dnd+ strains when we compared the pulsotypes with previous studies  <cit> . the  <dig> dnd+ strains were multidrug resistant with  <dig> extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  producers and 7/ <dig> were pathogenic vtec and were clonal  <cit> . the resistance and pathogenic state of these dnd+ strains may therefore pose possible threats to public health, hence improvement in their typeability is important to generate valuable epidemiological data. the pathogenic state of the dnd+ strains also prompted us to further explore the strain background of all  <dig> e. coli genomes that carried dnd operons. surprisingly, majority of them  were pathogenic in nature with  <dig> being diarrheagenic e. coli and  <dig> extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli. to the best of our knowledge, no study has reported this finding before and the link between virulence and dnd operons has yet to be explored. undoubtedly, bias might be present as pathogenic e. coli strains have higher level of public interest, and hence the availability of their genome data might be more compared to non-pathogenic e. coli. nevertheless, this finding may provide a caveat for future studies on the possible interesting relationship between pathogenicity and the presence of the dnd operon in e. coli.

the dnd clusters of different bacterial species have reportedly a diverse nature  <cit> , not only with regard to their respective sequence similarities, but also the genetic context of the dnd clusters as well. some bacterial species harboured a 4-gene dndbcde operon whereas others carried a five-gene dnd cluster . in fact, dnda is not found in the dnd clusters of all enterobacteriaceae reported in dnddb , indicating that the gene contents in the dnd clusters for closely related bacteria are similar. this is also the reason why dnda gene was not included as a target gene for prediction of degradation phenotype of e. coli in our study. although dnda might be absent in some dnd clusters, studies have revealed that isca can serve as functional homologues of dnda and may be found in more than one copy in the genome  <cit> . as previously reported  <cit> , the dnd cluster of e. coli belonged to the 4-gene dndbcde operon. all  <dig> dnd+e. coli strains in this study were positive for the dndb-dnde genes and the presence of dndb-dnde genes was significantly associated with the dna degradation phenotypes . this indicates that the presence of these genes can be a potential genetic marker to predict the phenotype of dna degradation. a previous study  <cit>  developed an assay to predict the dna degradation phenotype of mycobacterium abscessus based on the fact that the dnd gene cluster was associated with a genomic island of the m. abscessus complex and the genetic environment of the dnd- encoding gi was highly conserved. one pair of primers targeted the dndc gene while another pair confirmed the absence of the dnd operon. if the dnd operon is present, the amplicon will be too large to be amplified. on the other hand, if the dnd-encoding gi is absent, a short bridge amplicon spanning the gi insertion site will be generated for dnd−m. abscessus strains  <cit> . however, this approach was not applicable in our study due to the variable genetic environment of the e. coli dnd operons based on msa analysis. hence for e. coli, the detection of all  <dig> dndb-dnde genes would be a better alternative to confirm the presence of the dnd operon.

the dissemination of dnd operons was reportedly facilitated by mobile genetic elements especially gis  <cit> . hence, representative e. coli genomes harbouring dnd operons were subjected to genomic island determination. our data showed that all the dnd operons in the selected genomes were in fact located in gis. out of  <dig> dnd operons described in dnddb,  <dig> were also reported to be located in chromosomal islands, one was plasmid-encoded while another one is located in a plasmid-derived chromosomal segment. these results showed the potential role of genomic islands in facilitating the horizontal gene transfer of dnd operons. genomic islands have also been known to be the mechanism of diversification contributing to bacterial evolution  <cit> . however, it should be noted that majority of the genomes of e. coli in this study were draft genomes. thus, we were unable to ascertain if the dnd-encoding gis identified were chromosomally located or plasmid-encoded. further analysis would be necessary to verify their location.

the genetic environment of the dnd operon in e. coli is very diverse . on the other hand, the dnd operon together along with its immediate vicinity in erwinia amylovora and salmonella enterica appeared to be conserved within the same bacterial species , indicating that their genetic environment could be similar. analysis of representative e. coli genomes has shown that their respective dnd operons were associated with genomic islands that possess diverse genetic context. different genetic fragments of the island that corresponded to regions of different types of e. coli genomes  indicate that the genetic elements were likely acquired from different origins. genetic variation can also be observed among highly conserved dnd-encoding gis due to insertion or deletion of transposases along with other hypothetical proteins . a large cluster of t6ss was also found inserted into the upstream of another dnd-encoding island . furthermore, marked difference in gc content was also observed across the dnd-encoding gis, supporting the mosaic composition of the gis carrying dnd operons. the mosaic structure of the dnd-encoding gis , presence of phage-like integrases and presence of transposable elements flanking the gis as well as across the dnd-encoding gis , suggest multiple integration or recombination events, which has also been reported by he et al.,   <cit>  for the dnd-encoding gi of streptomyces lividans  <dig>  insertion and deletion of genetic elements as well as recombination appear to play an essential role in the constant evolution of these gis.

besides the diverse genetic context of the dnd-encoding gis of e. coli, the trna genes associated with the islands can also be variable. the 3′-end of trna genes frequently served as the insertion sites for foreign dna fragments  <cit> . all  <dig> dnd-encoding gis described in this study were associated with trna genes, but only limited to three types  , which have also been reported to be among the most frequently targeted trna genes for insertion in e. coli  <cit> . one of the possible reasons that particular trna genes often served as an integration hotspot is that the integrases of gis may have specificity for certain trna genes  <cit> . for e. coli koege  <dig> and kte  <dig> which harboured two dnd-encoding gis within the same genome, their respective dnd-encoding gis were also associated with different trna genes  . however, it should be noted that not all gis are associated with trna genes  <cit> .

this is the first report describing two dnd operons found in the same bacterial genome. however, the benefits to its host, if any, are unknown. several advantages to bacteria with dna phosphorothioation modification have been proposed. one of them is that the modified host dna is able to act as an antioxidant as phosphorothioation gave the modified dna chemical reduction property. thus, the modified dna is resistant to growth inhibition and oxidative double-stranded dna breakage caused by h2o <dig>  <cit> . h2o <dig> is generated during aerobic metabolism and studies have revealed that aerobic e. coli can generate high levels of h2o <dig> that are toxic enough to cause damage to their own dna. on the other hand, exogenous h2o <dig> can also be found in the environment as competing organisms can release h2o <dig> as toxin to suppress the growth of competitors  <cit> . bacteria can get killed by high levels of h2o <dig> generated endogenously and exogenously. hence it is essential to protect the host bacteria against damage caused by peroxide and dna that has been modified by phosphorothioation was hypothesized as one of the mechanisms that can offer protection to the host  <cit> . nevertheless, the biological implication of having two copies of the dnd operons within a genome is currently unknown.

all the dnd-encoding gis identified in this study also harboured dptfgh, a set of three conserved dnd-linked orthologs which are often found near the dnd operon. e. coli kte <dig> and koege <dig> which harboured  <dig> dnd-encoding gis in the same genome also carried the three conserved genes within the islands. the conserved dnd-linked orthologs have been proven to function as restriction systems in salmonella enterica serovar cerro <dig>  <cit>  and recently, in e. coli b7a  <cit> . the restriction system is able to restrict foreign dna  that lacks the specific phosphorothioation modification when the host dna is protected by the modification, and hence prevents the invasion of heterologous dna  <cit> . phosphorothioate dna modifications incorporated by dnd proteins  that work together with the dptfgh- restriction system function as a restriction-modification  system, which is evident in e. coli b7a  <cit> . however, the same study also ruled out other known r-m mechanisms, namely the types i, ii, iii and iv r-m systems  <cit> , implying that the dpt-dnd system is likely a new r-m-type mechanism. these two systems which are located in the same genomic island provide selective advantages to the bacterial host and hence may be stably maintained  <cit> . nevertheless, the three conserved dnd-linked orthologs were not identified in all dnd encoding gis described in previous studies  <cit>  but only in several diverse bacterial strains such as e. coli, hahelia chejuensis, oceanobacter sp., and bacillus cereus. this serves to underline not only the diversity of the genetic environment surrounding the various dnd operons but also their possible roles in their respective hosts. perhaps they are like toxin-antitoxin systems which have multiple biological functions depending on their location in the genome and their respective hosts  <cit>  which have adopted and adapted these genetic modules for cellular function. intriguingly, previously described dnd-encoding gi of geobacter uraniireducens rf <dig> was also found to carry putative toxin-antitoxin loci  <cit> . the presence of the dnd operons in such varied genomic islands in e. coli and their biological implication will hopefully be revealed in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
the designed pcr assay and the use of thiourea in pfge may improve the detection and typeability of dnd+e. coli strains. our study showed that genomic islands not only play a potential pivotal role in facilitating the horizontal gene transfer of dnd operons, but also essential in generating diversity within the genomic islands of closely related bacteria. different dnd-enoding genomic islands with mosaic compositions were identified within e. coli. since the dnd operon is often associated with mobile genetic elements, the operon may be integrated into genetically diverse strains followed by dissemination. therefore the dnd+ phenotype can be observed in both genetically closely related and diverse strains. the finding that dnd operons were more often found in pathogenic e. coli may provide caveat for future study on their possible linkage.
