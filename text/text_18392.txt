BACKGROUND
fruit ripening and senescence are active processes initiated by internal and environmental factors. considerable evidence suggests that cellular energy supply is a key factor controlling ripening and senescence events, and that aging and browning of postharvest horticultural crops may be related to inadequate supplies and reduced efficiency of cellular energy generation  <cit> . a salient feature initiating the aging process is a decline in adenosine triphosphate  levels. for instance, increased membrane permeability and enhanced reactive oxygen species  production by harvested fruit are related to low atp and energy charge  levels  <cit> . preharvest application of boron  and calcium   <cit> , and postharvest treatments, including ethylene inhibitors  <cit> , high oxygen  <cit> , anaerobic conditions  <cit> , controlled atmosphere  storage  <cit> , an exogenous carbon source  <cit>  and atp  <cit> , can maintain tissue levels of atp and ec, thereby delaying pericarp browning of litchi and longan and internal flesh browning in 'conference' pears. in addition, exogenous atp elevates atp levels, inhibits ros accumulation, and maintains unsaturated fatty acid levels and membrane integrity, thus delaying senescence and deterioration of horticultural products  <cit> . therefore, browning and senescence are closely related with cellular energy status, and measures to maintain energy levels can delay aging and inhibit occurrence of browning and deterioration to a certain extent. however, the mechanism contributing to the energy deficit remains unclear owing to the diversity of energy regulatory elements and complexity of energy production, transfer and control. moreover, a growing body of evidence indicates that cellular energy levels are closely related to the activity, transcription and translation of certain regulatory elements  <cit> . among these regulatory elements, proteins that synthesize , dissipate , transport  and regulate  atp have attracted considerable attention.

f1f0-atp synthase is a multimeric enzyme that catalyzes the final step of oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation, the synthesis of atp from adp and inorganic phosphate   <cit> . the general structure of the core subunits of the enzyme are highly conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and are designated as αβγδε  <cit> . as a novel cell death regulator, subunit β  plays a pivotal role in stress responses. up-regulation of atpb transcription marks initiation of the aging process  <cit> . complex v cannot be assembled successfully and respiration rates are reduced resulting in inhibition of atp synthesis in the absence of the β subunit  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether atpb acts as a senescence marker gene in fruit as in photosynthetic tissues.

aox and ucp are ubiquitous in plants and have various physiological roles. these include heat production and protection against oxygen free radicals mediating the non-phosphorylating bypasses that affect atp synthesis  <cit> . in plants ucp and aox belong to multigene families, of which members exhibit specific organ and temporal expression patterns that respond differentially to stress conditions  <cit> . aox expression and activity are generally induced under stress conditions, and consequently aox is used as a marker for cell reprogramming under stress  <cit> . the alternate oxidation pathway may slow down the aging process and quality deterioration of postharvest horticultural crops  <cit> . furthermore, changes in aox and ucp accumulation in vine-ripened fruit differ significantly from those of postharvest-ripened fruit  <cit> . this implies that a complementary relationship exists between the two energy dissipation pathways. several reports have described the complex regulation of aox and ucp at the translational and posttranslational levels. however, most research on these two genes has focused on climacteric fruit, such as tomato, apple, banana, and mango  <cit> , and their roles in non-climacteric fruit remains unclear.

adp/atp carrier  belongs to the high-abundance mitochondrial transporter protein family  <cit> . it catalyzes a counter-exchange of cytosolic adp with matrix atp, enabling mitochondria to supply the cytosol, and subsequently other organelles, with energy  <cit> . in higher organisms aac is the core protein of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator and the main regulator of mitochondrial atp concentration  <cit> . as ‘the energy regulator’ in the cell, sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase  can sense the internal energy status by measuring cytosolic atp/  ratios and controlling the expression and phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, no report has documented these two genes in the development and senescence of fruit.

overall, in contrast to the relatively well-known physiological roles of these genes in stress responses, little information is available on how these genes contribute to the energy status of developing and senescing fruit. studying the transcript level of these genes in relation to cellular energy status is crucial to identify causal agents contributing to energy deficits and their role in fruit ripening and senescence. this knowledge may provide opportunities to develop new strategies to control fruit ripening and the aging process and ultimately extend the storage life of harvested fruit.

litchi is a non-climacteric, tropical and subtropical fruit with a high commercial value on the international market. litchi fruit deteriorate rapidly after harvest because of water loss, pericarp browning and rot development  <cit> . our previous studies reported that an exogenous atp supply enhanced antioxidant systems and maintained membrane integrity to delay browning and senescence of litchi fruit  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain unclear. in the current study, full-length sequences of atpb, aox <dig>  ucp <dig>  aac <dig> and snrk <dig> were cloned from litchi fruit. transcript abundance of these energy-related genes, respiration intensity and fruit energy status were determined for developing and postharvest-senescent litchi fruit.

RESULTS
preharvest
growth curve and pericarp color of litchi fruit
figure 1a shows the appearance of fruit at five developmental stages ranging from  <dig> days after flowering   to  <dig> daf  at 10-day intervals. fruit growth was divided into two stages. stage i  represented a rapid growth phase, whereas stage ii  was a slow growth phase as fruit approached maturity . lightness values significantly increased during stage i , but chroma values increased more markedly at 50- <dig> daf, which indicated that color intensity rose before it decreased . hue angle decreased slowly at 50- <dig> daf, but more substantially from  <dig> to  <dig> daf before attaining a plateau , which was consistent with the change in color of the pericarp .

data are the mean ± standard deviation .

respiration intensity, oxygen consumption rate and cyanide-resistant respiration
whole-fruit respiration intensity decreased significantly during stage i, but increased slightly during stage ii . the decrease in respiration intensity during stage i may be feedback to enhanced adp accumulation . oxygen consumption rate  declined significantly after  <dig> daf and thereafter did not change . cyanide-resistant respiration capacity  increased significantly during fruit development and ripening at 50– <dig> daf , which implies it has a pivotal role in the balance between respiration and production of ros at these stages.

energy status
atp concentrations were correlated strongly with fruit fresh weight , and increased rapidly between  <dig> and  <dig> daf before slowing at the final stage of maturation  . adp concentrations increased during stage i but decreased progressively during stage ii . amp concentrations decreased gradually throughout fruit development, but increased slightly in the last  <dig> days before harvest . total adenylate levels increased steadily between  <dig> and  <dig> daf, and did not change thereafter . the ec level of the fruit remained relatively constant in young fruit, and increased markedly as the fruit ripened between  <dig> and  <dig> daf . the atp/amp ratio peaked at  <dig> daf, and thereafter declined until maturity .

isolation and sequence analysis of energy-related genes
partial sequence fragments of energy-related genes were isolated by reverse transcription- pcr  using degenerate primers . sequencing of several of these fragments revealed the existence of one isoform for each gene. these genes were lcatpb , lcaox <dig> , lcucp <dig> , lcaac <dig>  and lcsnrk <dig> . full-length sequences of these genes were obtained after 3′ and 5′-race. these sequences were compared with known sequences from other species using the ncbi blast server. the genbank accession codes of the sequences are listed in table  <dig> 

atpb, atp synthase β subunit; aox <dig>  alternative oxidase 1; ucp <dig>  uncoupling mitochondrial protein 1; aac <dig>  adp/atp carrier 1; snrk <dig>  sucrose non-fermenting-1-related kinase  <dig> 

see legend for table  <dig> for names of genes.

the coding region of lcatpb was  <dig> bp in length, encoding a deduced 459-amino acid  sequence, with a predicted mw of  <dig>  kda and a calculated isoelectric point  of  <dig> . lcatpb was 92% homologous with the atpb from koelreuteria paniculata, a close relative of litchi. the c-terminal domain of the β subunit contained the highly conserved ‘delseed’ motif  involved in mechanochemical coupling of atp synthase  <cit> . aox belongs to a multigene family in many plants, including mango, tomato and other horticultural crops. two types of aox genes are present in angiosperms  <cit> , of which isoforms may be differentially expressed in fruit and other tissues, such as in tomato  <cit> . while in the present study, transcript evidence showed support for a single predicted isoform  for all candidates in litchi fruit pericarp and consequently only this isoform was detected during experimental validation. lcaox <dig> , encoding a  <dig> aa sequence , showed 71% identity with that of nicotiana glutinosa. site-directed mutagenesis has shown that several residues are required for aox activity  <cit> . the highly conserved residues were identified in litchi fruit using multiple sequence alignments of aox proteins from diverse organisms . ucp family from diverse organisms are grouped into five subfamilies, plant ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> belong to subfamilies ii. moreover, investigations have identified  <dig> to  <dig> genes that encode ucps in different plants  <cit> . the major feature of ucps from plants is the presence of three energy transfer protein signatures   <cit>  conserved in all ucp isoforms . in the present study, three copies of the etps signature were identified in lcucp <dig>  which contained an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> aa protein, with a predicted mw of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . a blast search of genbank revealed that lcucp <dig> shared 66% identity with atucp <dig>  from arabidopsis thaliana and 65% identity with rcucp  from ricinus communis at the protein level. a neighbor-joining cladogram further showed that lcucp <dig> was most similar to ucp from r. communis . there are four groups of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide carriers presented in the five eukaryotic clades, among which the adp/atp carriers are the best known. furthermore, three mitochondrial aac genes: ataac <dig>  ataac <dig>  and ataac <dig> were presented in the genome of a. thaliana <cit> . in the present study, lcaac <dig> gene isolated from litchi fruit pericarp contained an orf of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> aa protein , and exhibited 71% identity with aac <dig> from a. thaliana and 75% identity to aac from r. communis. lcaac <dig> contained a highly conserved rrrmmm signature motif   <cit> . on the basis of sequence similarity, domain structure and cellular function, the plant snrk family can be divided into three subfamilies: snrk <dig>  snrk <dig> and snrk <dig>  among these subfamilies, snrk <dig> is unique to plants and is involved in responses to environmental stresses  <cit> . in the present study, snrk cdna isolated from litchi pericarp was  <dig> bp in length with a  <dig> bp orf encoding a predicted polypeptide of  <dig> aa . the deduced amino acid sequence showed homology with counterpart snrk <dig> family members, namely r. communis, glycine max, zea mays, and a. thaliana. similar to other snrk <dig> genes, the n-terminal catalytic domain was highly conserved, containing an atp-binding site  and protein kinase activating signature , whereas the c-terminal regulatory domain contained an acidic ‘patch’, which is essential for kinase activity . in a neighbor-joining cladogram lcsnrk <dig> and its counterparts ossapk <dig>  zmsnrk <dig> , gmsark <dig>  and rcsapk <dig> were clustered in subclass  <dig>  as reported by zhang et al.  <cit> .

spatial and temporal expression of energy-related gene transcripts
expression analysis of energy-related genes indicated ubiquitous expression in all tissues tested . the most notable features of the tissue expression profiles were that lcucp <dig>  exhibited strongest expression in the root in which transcript levels were some 100-fold greater than those detected in the other tissues. in contrast, the remaining genes exhibited high expression in vegetative tissues . lcatpb and lcaac <dig> were expressed most strongly in the leaf . lcatpb and lcaox <dig> showed the highest expression in the root and leaf, with lower levels of expression detected in the stem, and weakest expression was observed in the fruit pericarp, aril and seed . thus, lcsnrk <dig> exhibited strongest expression in the stem, root, leaf, and pericarp, and weakest expression in the aril and seed .

expression of lcatpb was up-regulated by 114% at 80– <dig> daf , which was consistent with changes in atp concentration . increased transcript abundance of lcaox <dig> peaked at 14-fold at  <dig> daf but significant differences in transcript abundance at other stages of fruit development were not observed . abundance of lcucp <dig> declined by 43% between  <dig> and  <dig> daf before increasing by 363% at  <dig> daf and thereafter declining rapidly by 48% at  <dig> daf . lcaac <dig> and lcsnrk <dig> exhibited similar changes in transcript levels . transcription of these two genes increased significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> daf before decreasing to the lowest levels between  <dig> and  <dig> daf, but recovered partly in the final stage of maturation .

postharvest
disease incidence, pericarp browning, proportion of edible fruit, and membrane permeability
the fruit disease and pericarp browning indices increased after harvest, whereas the proportion of edible fruit decreased. exogenous atp treatment reduced disease incidence and delayed tissue browning of the fruit significantly . the disease and browning indices were 19% and 80% in the non-atp-treated  fruit, but only 3% and 49% in atp-treated fruit, by the end of storage. the proportion of edible fruit significantly increased after atp treatment, by 21% and 28% compared with control fruit, after  <dig> and  <dig> days of storage, respectively . membrane permeability reflects senescence and deterioration of plant tissue and is usually measured as relative conductivity. this parameter increased in harvested fruit with no significant difference between atp-treated and control fruit observed during 0– <dig> days of storage, but was significantly lower in atp-treated fruit at the end of storage. these results suggested that exogenous atp treatment protected the membrane system and, thus, delayed senescence and deterioration of litchi fruit in storage .

respiration intensity, oxygen consumption rate, and cyanide-resistant respiration
respiration intensity fluctuated and was significantly blocked by atp treatment . the oxygen consumption rate peaked after  <dig> days of storage and was enhanced significantly by atp application . in the first  <dig> days of storage ρvalt/vt decreased significantly, then rose slowly during the medial period of storage and increased sharply by the end of storage; exogenous atp treatment significantly slowed down these effects . in the atp-treated fruit ρvalt/vt was relatively stable throughout the storage process, which indicated that stability in ρvalt/vt played an important role in maintenance of fruit storability.

energy status
the atp concentration significantly decreased by 69% during  <dig> days of storage, and the severity of the decline was reduced in atp-treated fruit . no significant difference in adp concentration was observed during the  <dig> days of storage, whereas atp treatment reduced adp levels by 37% compared to that of control fruit after  <dig> days of storage . the amp concentration significantly increased during the first  <dig> days of storage before decreasing as storage progressed, and atp treatment significantly depressed  amp levels . the total adenylate concentration decreased significantly during postharvest storage and was 57% lower by the end of storage, but was up-regulated by atp treatment . energy charge showed the same pattern but no significant difference in ec level between control and atp-treated fruit was observed by the end of storage . the atp/amp ratio decreased significantly after harvest. atp treatment significantly attenuated the decrease in the atp/amp ratio until  <dig> days of storage .

abundance of energy-related gene transcripts
lcatpb expression significantly increased and peaked  <dig> days after harvest before declining, whereas exogenous atp treatment blocked the expression peak at  <dig> days postharvest . lcaox <dig> transcript abundance remained stable until  <dig> days of storage, and thereafter increased constantly to 17-fold higher than the initial level at  <dig> days of storage. exogenous atp significantly inhibited the rise in lcaox <dig> transcript level after  <dig> days of storage . the lcucp <dig> transcript level declined during the first  <dig> days of storage, with a slight increase observed thereafter, and atp slowed both of these changes . the lcaac <dig> transcript level rose slowly after harvest and no marked effect was imposed by exogenous atp application . the transcript abundance of lcsnrk <dig> decreased within the first  <dig> days of storage and subsequently increased, and atp slowed both of these changes .

discussion
preharvest
atp level increased and energy charge remained relatively constant during fruit development and ripening
changes in energy levels may be a key factor in switching on fruit ripening and senescence. initiation of senescence is characterized by a reduced atp level  <cit> . in the present study, atp, ec, and total adenylate levels and the atp/amp ratio increased rapidly, whereas the amp concentration decreased gradually, during fruit development  . atp is produced mainly by oxidation of carbohydrates and is regulated by transcription of key proteins catalyzing nucleotide synthesis  <cit> . the respiratory rate of pericarp tissue of litchi fruit declined during fruit development, whilst the cyanide-resistant respiration to total respiration ratio  and energy production were enhanced . a declining respiratory rate and enhanced alternative respiration is an overflow protection mechanism to prevent ros production  <cit> .

color-breaker stage at  <dig> daf may be a key turning point in fruit energy metabolism
we isolated total rnas from the root, stem, leaf, pericarp, aril and seed from fruit  <dig> daf for real-time rt-pcr analysis. five gene transcripts were predominantly expressed in the root, stem, and leaf at this specific developmental stage and increased significantly in developmental stage i except for lcucp <dig>  which was predominantly expressed only in the root, and lcatpb, which was up-regulated by the end of developmental stage ii. the lcatpb expression level rose continuously during fruit development and maturation consistent with the increased atp concentration . transcript abundance of lcaox <dig>  lcucp <dig>  lcaac <dig>  and lcsnrk <dig> reached peaks at  <dig> daf in the rank order lcaox <dig> >lcsnrk <dig> >lcaac <dig> >lcucp <dig> . their transcription peaks coincided with the peak in adp concentration . transcription peaks of aox1b and ucp were also observed in mango fruit at the turning stage  <cit> , which indicated that the color-breaker stage may be a key turning point in fruit energy metabolism. lcaox <dig>  lcucp <dig>  lcaac <dig> and lcsnrk <dig> transcript levels significantly decreased after  <dig> daf, allowing a surge in atp synthesis. under the combined effects of atpb, aox <dig>  ucp <dig>  aac <dig>  and snrk <dig>  the ec level remained relatively constant during fruit development and ripening. lcaox <dig> expression spiked at  <dig> daf, which probably reduced levels of ros generated by high rates of fruit photosynthesis. recent studies indicate that the snrk <dig> family plays key roles in stress responses, such as hyperosmotic stress and abscisic acid  signaling. aba is involved in the maturation of many climacteric and non-climacteric fruit. commonly, endogenous aba concentrations increase during fruit maturation, whereas exogenous application of aba accelerates fruit ripening or maturation  <cit> . sugar signaling also regulates senescence in a complex network with other signals  <cit>  resulting from biotic or abiotic stress. snrk <dig> has been implicated in stress and aba-mediated signaling pathways  <cit> . enhanced transcript abundance of lcsnrk <dig> at  <dig> daf might be a consequence of increased aba and sugar accumulation during maturation of litchi fruit  <cit> .

postharvest
atp and energy charge levels decreased significantly in postharvest litchi fruit
the levels of atp, total adenylate, and ec, and the atp/amp ratio significantly decreased, but the amp concentration significantly increased, in stored harvested fruit . similar results were reported for apples, pears, cut flowers, and other horticultural products  <cit> . atp content decreased significantly in ‘jonagold’ apples during controlled atmosphere storage. brown heart disease of ‘conference’ pears during storage was partly attributed to energy depletion  <cit> . as the petals of carnation cut flowers wilt , atp synthesis decreases  <cit> . atp concentrations were negatively correlated with the browning index and proportion of edible fruit, which was consistent with our previous work  <cit> . atp and ec levels in horticultural crops can be maintained by appropriate handling, thus effectively postponing senescence. application of ethylene inhibitors, high oxygen, anaerobic conditions, exogenous sucrose, or atp can maintain the atp content and ec levels in litchi, longan, tulip and carnation flowers, thereby delaying pericarp browning and extending flowering longevity  <cit> . in the present study, the decrease in atp, total adenylate, and ec levels and the atp/amp ratio were significantly slowed by exogenous atp. at the same time, the disease and browning indices were lower and commodity rates were higher in atp-treated fruit . these data support the hypothesis that intracellular energy depletion or atp deficiency induce senescence of horticultural crops. respiratory intensity decreased in harvested litchi fruit but increased rapidly during 2– <dig> days in storage. respiration rates might be activated by adp accumulated during the first  <dig> days of fruit storage . energy levels, oxygen consumption rate, and ρvalt/vt were increased by exogenous atp treatment. a reduced respiration rate is apparently favorable to extend the storage life of litchi fruit. the highly flexible nature of respiratory metabolism in plants allows survival under varying and often stressful environmental and nutritional conditions  <cit> . in the present study, exogenous atp treatment extended the storage life of litchi fruit by reducing respiration intensity, which differed from the results of klotz et al.  <cit>  that suggested adenylates did not limit respiration in stored sugarbeet roots.

decrease in atp and energy charge levels may have resulted from imbalanced accumulation of lcaox <dig> and lcatpb transcripts in postharvest litchi fruit
lcatpb transcription was up-regulated in harvested litchi fruit, which might restrain the rapid decline in atp level during 0– <dig> days of storage. exogenous atp treatment inhibited lcatpb expression, possibly by feedback inhibition by atp. chivasa  <cit>  reported a new role for atpb as a pro-cell death protein. in the current study, in preharvest  or postharvest  litchi fruit, the rapid increase of lcatpb expression followed by rapid senescence and decline in fruit quality suggested that the increase in lcatpb transcript level marked initiation of the aging process. during abiotic stresses, such as heat shock and hypoxia, ampks  switch off atp-consuming processes and activate atp-generating catabolic pathways through direct enzyme regulation and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . snrk may sense atp deficiency and trigger downstream transcription of atpb <cit> . in the present study, the transcript abundance of lcatpb was significantly increased in postharvest litchi fruit, which might be regulated by lcsnrk <dig> 

ucp and aox energy-dissipating systems play similar roles in mitochondrial energy-linked processes in plants, either through tissue-specific thermogenesis or by protecting plant cells against oxidative stress. the initial steps of cellular death are accompanied by an oxidative burst, depletion of atp, and a strong stimulation of aox expression  <cit> . in the present study, the transcript abundance of lcaox <dig> in litchi fruit was significantly up-regulated during storage. the lower atp level in control fruit might have resulted from enhanced transcription and activity of aox. mitochondrial inner membrane ucps catalyze a proton conductance that dissipates the proton electrochemical gradient established by the respiratory chain, thus affecting atp synthesis. lcucp <dig> continued to decline in the first  <dig> days of storage, but thereafter rebounded slightly. differential expression and complementary function of aox and ucp is reported in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and plant tissues, and may be regulated by ethylene, low temperature, and other factors  <cit>  through different catalytic efficiencies under distinct physiological conditions  <cit> . adp/atp carrier  is unable to modify the net content of adenine nucleotides  because it always exchanges one nucleotide for another, whereas mutation of the aac signature sequence  inhibits atp synthesis in cells and isolated mitochondria. in addition, loss of endogenous nucleotides is responsible for impeding adp/atp transport  <cit> . in the present study, lcaac <dig> was up-regulated, and its transcript abundance negatively correlated with a decreased adenylate pool, in litchi fruit during storage. furthermore, lcaac <dig> was not significantly affected by exogenous atp treatment , which indicated that lcaac <dig> was not sensitive to adenylate content. transcript abundance of lcatpb, lcaox <dig>  and lcaac <dig> were significantly up-regulated, whereas lcucp <dig> and lcsnrk <dig> expression decreased before being enhanced, in harvested fruit and atp supplementation slowed all these changes . moreover, lcaox <dig> transcript abundance was significantly higher than that of lcatpb. under the joint action of lcatpb, lcaox <dig>  lcucp <dig>  lcaac <dig>  and lcsnrk <dig>  the ec remained relatively balanced between  <dig> and  <dig> days of storage. however, the dynamic energy equilibrium was eventually broken, probably because of dramatic increases in the transcript level of lcaox <dig> after  <dig> days of storage, causing a significant decrease in atp and ec levels by the end of storage, which was correlated with rapid fruit deterioration .

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated energy characteristics and the level of five transcripts that are involved in the modulation of atp levels during preharvest development and postharvest senescence of litchi fruit. measurements were also recorded after atp treatment of harvested fruits. senescence and deterioration of litchi fruit during storage was closely related to atp content and ec levels. dramatic increase in lcatpb expression either in planta or postharvest suggested that lcatpb expression may mark the onset of senescence of litchi fruit. the energy status in litchi fruit seems to be controlled by the combined effects of genes responsible for energy production, dissipation, transfer and regulation, in which lcatpb and lcaox <dig> play a decisive role. given their importance for energy regulation, these genes could be used to generate markers for the breeding of new litchi cultivars that show increased atp production or fruit with a longer postharvest storage life.
