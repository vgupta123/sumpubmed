BACKGROUND
the latest version of the public human genome assembly ncbi build  <dig>  has been released and is considered to be the successor to ncbi build  <dig>  currently, different types of human genetic variation studies including single-nucleotide polymorphisms , deletions, insertions and structure variation are all based on the human reference genome  <cit> . moreover, the reference genome is the fundamental resource for the researches in genomics and transcriptomics, such as investigating the transcriptional structure of genes, inferring splicing patterns and quantifying the expression level of each transcript  <cit> . therefore, the completeness of human reference genome is crucial for comprehensively understanding the structure of human genome.

although the annotation information on the human reference genome has provided important information in the study of evolutionary history, population diversity, gene regulatory mechanisms and various biological events, it is still incomplete. in previous studies, khaja et al.  <cit>  and kidd et al.  <cit>  have reported that a notable portion of human genomic sequences were absent from ncbi build  <dig> or build  <dig>  suggesting that the updated human reference genome is still not completely assembled and annotated. during the processes of mapping transcriptome sequencing reads onto the human reference genome to quantify the gene expression and infer alternative splicing or transcripts, the reads that cannot be mapped onto the human reference genome are usually simply discarded. in fact, some of those unmapped reads could be generated from certain functional genes that not present in the reference genome. simply discarding such sequences can result in the loss of important information.

by comparing to the human reference genome ncbi build  <dig>  li et al. also identified a significant amount of asian  and african  novel sequences that not present in ncbi build  <dig>  and they speculated that most of those novel sequences are specific to asian and african  <cit> . the new version of human reference genome ncbi build  <dig> resolves some problems existed in ncbi build  <dig> and provides us the opportunity to further explore these potential asian  and african  novel sequences. besides, the high sequencing throughput and feasibility of the sequencing technology for transcriptome  <cit>  allow us to better understand the genome structure of the human genome. here we further investigated the completeness of human reference genome and revealed a significant number of human genes and novel transcript contigs that are absent from ncbi build  <dig> 

our findings show that the asian  and african  novel sequences that are absent from ncbi build  <dig> contain a significant portion of regions that can be transcribed. and our results indicate that many of those transcribed sequences are not specific to asian  and african , but are also present in caucasian populations. we also found that about half of  <dig> refseq genes that are unalignable to the human reference genome are expressed in human brain or cell lines. in addition, we identified hundreds of novel transcript contigs in human brain and cell lines through de novo assemblies of brain and cell line transcriptome. our study suggests that the human reference genome is still missing a significant number of genes that can be transcribed and many of those missing genes are likely functional. with the help of de novo transcriptome assembly, we can further detect the missing information of the reference genome and better understand the structure of human genome. the comparative approach of genome sequences between reference genome and other related human genomes based on the transcriptome provides an alternative approach to refine the human reference genome.

RESULTS
detecting transcribed regions in asian and african novel sequences
we used two transcriptome sequencing datasets from two reference rna samples established by the microarray quality control  project  <cit>  with illumina next-generation sequencing technology to carry out our study . the two reference rna samples consist of the universal human reference rna  from  <dig> human cell lines of various origins  <cit>  and the human brain reference rna  from several regions of the brain of  <dig> adult donors . the two datasets consist of ~ <dig>  million and ~ <dig>  million of sequencing reads, respectively, with read-lengths of  <dig> bp .

in a previous study, by comparing to the human reference genome ncbi build  <dig> with >  <dig> bp long and < 90% identity criteria, li et al. identified ~ <dig> mb of asian  and ~ <dig> mb african  novel sequences were not present in ncbi build  <dig>  and they inferred that most of those novel sequences are individual or population specific  <cit> . to examine how many of these asian  and african  novel sequences have been incorporated into grch <dig>  we aligned  <cit>  these novel sequences to grch <dig>  using 90% identity and 98% coverage as threshold, we found that only  <dig>  kb  asian  and  <dig>  kb  african  novel sequences could be aligned to grch <dig>  and the rest were still unalignable to grch <dig>  the results suggest that those alignable asian  and african  novel sequences are part of gaps or unsolved issues in ncbi build  <dig> 

to verify whether genes contained in asian  and african  novel sequences are expressed in brain and/or cell lines, we first predicted the genes in these novel sequences using augustus  <cit> . predictive results showed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes  are contained in asian  and african  novel sequences, respectively. to further verify the prediction, we mapped  <cit>  brain and cell line  <dig> bp reads onto the asian  and african  novel sequences respectively to identify the splice junctions between the exons  <cit> . we inferred that there were  <dig> and  <dig>  junctions in asian  novel sequences, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> junctions existed in african  novel sequences, respectively.

we next carried out transcript assembly and quantification  <cit>  using asian  and african  novel sequences as reference sequences. we obtained  <dig>  brain  and  <dig>  cell line  transcripts from asian  novel sequences . meanwhile, we identified  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  transcripts from african  novel sequences . those transcripts were the assembled fragments generated from cufflinks  <cit> . in the asian  novel sequences, the brain transcripts covered  <dig> predicted genes and the cell line transcripts covered  <dig> predicted genes, with  <dig> predicted genes in common to both samples. in the african  novel sequences, brain transcripts covered  <dig> predicted genes and cell line transcripts covered  <dig> predicted genes, of which  <dig> predicted genes were in common. we also found that  <dig> brain and  <dig> cell line transcripts from asian  novel sequences could be aligned to grch37; and  <dig> brain and  <dig> cell line transcripts from african  novel sequences could be aligned to grch <dig>  revealing that some genes are absent from ncbi build  <dig>  and part of them have been refined in grch <dig>  in sum, we observed  <dig> %  asian  and  <dig> %  african  novel sequences transcribed in brain, and  <dig> %  asian  and  <dig> %  african  novel sequences transcribed in cell lines. moreover, the ethnic group of brain donors  indicates that many of these transcribed sequences are not specific to asian  and african , but also present in caucasian.

quantifying the expression of unalignable refseq genes
to gain insights into the expression profile of those human ncbi refseq genes that are unalignable to grch <dig>  we first aligned the human ncbi refseq gene sequences onto grch <dig>  we collected  <dig> refseq genes with identity < 90% or coverage < 95% to grch <dig>  defining them as "unalignable refseq genes". the reason we chose 95% coverage as the threshold is that if a refseq gene sequence is  <dig> kb long in length, 5% deletion of its length is  <dig> bp. this small deletion can have a strong effect on its annotation on the reference genome and the number of reads mapping to this refseq gene. next, we used mortazavi's approach  <cit>  to estimate the expression level of these unalignable refseq genes in brain and cell lines . using  <dig>  rpkm as threshold, we observed  <dig> unalignable refseq genes expressed in brain and  <dig> unalignable refseq genes expressed in cell lines, with  <dig> unalignable refseq genes in common . among these unalignable expressed refseq genes,  <dig> from brain  and  <dig> from cell lines  are hypothetical genes with unknown functions, the rest are from different gene families including phospholipase inhibitor loc <dig>  non-coding rna ncrna <dig>  neuregulin nrg <dig> . for those unalignable expressed refseq genes curated in ncbi , they have diverse important functions. for example, the kcnip <dig> gene, which is the regulatory subunit of kv4/d -type voltage-gated rapidly inactivating a-type potassium channels, is annotated in ncbi as partial on reference assembly. another example is the fgf <dig> gene, which is a member of the fibroblast growth factor  family and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion, but its annotation category in ncbi also belongs to the partial on reference assembly. those unalignable expressed refseq genes could result from the misassembly of the human reference genome and their absence will restrict our understanding of the complete structure, the function of the human genome, and limit our interpretation of the related biology processes those genes are involved in.

to check whether those unalignable expressed refseq genes in brain and cell lines are conserved, we mapped them onto chimpanzee and macaque genomes, respectively. using 90% identity and 90% coverage as threshold,  <dig> unalignable expressed refseq genes could be aligned to chimpanzee and  <dig> unalignable expressed refseq genes could be aligned to macaque for brain sample ; while  <dig> unalignable expressed refseq genes could be aligned to chimpanzee and  <dig> unalignable expressed refseq genes could be aligned to macaque for cell lines . among those  <dig> unalignable expressed brain refseq genes and  <dig> unalignable expressed cell line refseq genes that are aligned to both chimpanzee and macaque,  <dig> are in common. the results signify that those unalignable expressed refseq genes that could be both mapped to chimpanzee and macaque genomes are highly conserved across human, chimpanzee and macaque, indicating their potential significant function and biological importance. among the unalignable expressed refseq genes between brain and cell lines,  <dig> have been annotated as predicted with unknown functions, we then mapped those  <dig> human refseq genes to the refseq genes of chimpanzee and macaque. using blast with a cut-off of e-value < 10- <dig> and identity > 80%, we found  <dig> predicted human refseq genes matching with the refseq genes of chimpanzee and macaque, but most of those matched refseq genes of chimpanzee and macaque are also annotated as predicted and only two of them have related functional annotation  and another is autophagy related  <dig> homolog ). the nfkbil <dig> gene may be a negative regulator of nf-kappa-b activation. the atg <dig> gene has been annotated as an autophagy factor required for autophagosome formation and it is conserved in human, chimpanzee, mouse, dog, cow, rat, chicken and zebrafish.

these results suggest that when based on only the incomplete human reference genome, it will certainly miss many expressed genes not presented in the reference genome. as we can see from figure  <dig>  the expression levels of some unalignable refseq genes are high, indicating that those unalignable refseq genes are active in brain or cell lines. over two thirds of these unalignable expressed refseq genes in brain and cell lines are hypothetical genes and may have important unknown functions. therefore, it would be essential to examine the expression profile of those genes and elucidate their biological functions through various experimental and/or computational approaches in the future.

de novo assemblies of brain and cell line transcriptome
to examine whether any other novel gene expressed beyond the human reference genome, human refseq genes and est sequences, we carried out de novo short-read assemblies using velvet  <cit>  on both brain and cell line transcriptome sequencing data. since the assembly errors are usually enriched in the short and low coverage assembly contigs, we removed the contigs with length <  <dig> bp and coverage <  <dig>  using this threshold, we obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcript contigs from brain and cell lines, respectively . the n <dig> contig size is  <dig> bp for brain and  <dig> bp for cell lines, the max contig size is  <dig>  bp for brain and  <dig>  bp for cell lines.

we then aligned  <cit>  brain and cell line contigs onto grch <dig>  human ncbi refseq genes and est sequences with 90% identity and 90% coverage as threshold. after removing the contigs that can be aligned to them,  <dig>  brain and  <dig>  cell line contigs were left unalignable , we denoted them as "unmapped contigs", and used them to explore novel transcript contigs.

*the brain and cell line transcript contigs were aligned to the human reference genome , refseq genes and est sequences with 90% indentify and 90% coverage as threshold. the unalignable brain and cell line transcript contigs were then aligned to human fosmid sequences, huref genome, celera genome, asian  and african  novel sequences, chimpanzee and macaque genomes with 90% identity and 100% coverage as the threshold.

identifying novel transcript sequences
to determine how many of those unmapped contigs were truly novel transcript contigs in brain and cell lines, we first aligned them to human fosmid sequences, huref  <cit>  genome, celera genome, the asian  and african  novel sequences. with the same criteria of > = 90% identity and 100% coverage,  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  unmapped contigs could be aligned to these human sequences or genomes. we further aligned these unmapped contigs of brain and cell lines to chimpanzee and macaque genomes. using 90% identity and 100% coverage as threshold, we found that  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  unmapped contigs can be aligned to chimpanzee genome;  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  unmapped contigs can be aligned to macaque genome . among them,  <dig> brain and  <dig> cell line unmapped contigs are in common between chimpanzee and macaque, suggesting that those novel transcript contigs are conserved among human, chimpanzee and macaque. besides those novel transcript contigs that can be aligned to human fosmid sequences, huref genome, celera genome, asian  and african  novel sequences,  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  unmapped contigs can only be aligned to the chimpanzee genome, and  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  unmapped contigs can only be aligned to the macaque genome.

in all, we identified  <dig> brain  and  <dig>  cell line novel transcript contigs that are unalignable to grch <dig>  refseq genes and est sequences . we then mapped those identified brain and cell line novel transcript contigs to the refseq genes of chimpanzee and macaque, using blast with the cut-off of e-value < 10- <dig> and identity > 80%,  <dig> brain and  <dig> cell line novel transcript contigs can find homologs from the refseq genes of chimpanzee and macaque. but all those matched refseq genes of chimpanzee and macaque have been annotated as predicted and still have no clear functions, suggesting that the related homologous genes of those novel transcript contigs are also not well annotated in chimpanzee and macaque.

our identified novel transcribed sequences may be missed by the limitation of previous technologies or their low expression. we found that besides those novel transcript contigs that mapped to asian  and african  novel sequences, many novel transcript contigs could still be aligned to either one of the huref genome, celera genome, fosmid sequence, chimpanzee and macaque genomes, or several of them. this indicates that some of those novel transcript contigs might be caucasian specific transcribed sequences. we also found that some novel transcript contigs have high similarities  among human, chimpanzee and macaque, implying that these novel transcript contigs are generated from conserved functional regions. in the end, the majority of brain and cell line unmapped contigs remain to be identified. those unidentified contigs could result from the following aspects: the limited number of available human genomes; the stringent selection criteria in each step; sequence alterations in mrnas from rna editing  <cit> ; variations in transcribed regions ; or the assembly errors in contigs due to the limitation of assembly algorithms  <cit>  and etc.

locating the positions of novel transcript contigs
to determine the location of those novel transcript contigs on the human chromosomes, we used huref and celera two human genomes as references to map them. among those novel transcript contigs,  <dig> brain  and  <dig> cell line  contigs can be aligned to huref or celera genomes.  <dig> brain and  <dig> cell line contigs can be only found an unique match location on huref or celera chromosomes , yet some of the remaining contigs can be aligned to more than one position , and others can be mapped onto the human unplaced genomic contigs.

to further position those novel transcript contigs onto grch <dig>  we extended  <dig> kb on both sides of those contigs with huref genome as the reference and then mapped the extended sequences onto grch <dig>  through alignment, we found that some of those novel transcript contigs could result from the small deletions of grch <dig>  some other contigs could be transcribed from the large deletions  of grch <dig> . however, we still could not find the appropriate locations for the rest extended sequences on grch <dig>  and these contigs could be generated from the huge deletions of grch <dig> 

*the "estimated deletions" were calculated by aligning the extended contigs  onto grch <dig> to find the distance between two broken sequences of each extended contigs.

rt-pcr validation of conserved novel transcript contigs
in the brain and cell lines,  <dig> brain and  <dig> cell line novel transcript contigs can be aligned to huref, celera, chimpanzee and macaque genomes, indicating that those contigs were transcribed from the conserved regions and might be functional. we then chose  <dig> of the conserved novel transcript contigs longer than  <dig> bp to validate their expression using rt-pcr, six of them were detected expressed in three different types of human normal cells . the experiment results further confirmed the reliability of our identification of those novel transcript contigs.

discussion
in this study, we detected a significant number of human genes and novel transcript contigs are still missing from the reference genome with human brain tissues and  <dig> mixed cell lines two transcriptome sequencing datasets. we verified that over 4% of asian  and 5% of african  previously identified novel sequences that are absent from ncbi build  <dig> can be transcribed in brain and cell lines, and many of those transcribed regions might be not specific to asian  and african , but also present in caucasian. we estimated the expression levels of  <dig> human ncbi refseq genes that are unalignable to grch <dig>  and found that about half of these unalignable refseq genes expressed in brain or cell lines, and some of them have been annotated with important functions. the majority of those unalignable expressed refseq genes are previously predicted by automated computational analysis with unknown functions, suggesting they have not been well studied yet. further analysis shows that over  <dig> of those unalignable expressed refseq genes are highly conserved across human, chimpanzee and macaque, indicating their importance in human biological processes. last, we carried out de novo transcriptome assemblies on both brain and cell line transcriptome, and identified hundreds of brain and cell line novel transcript contigs that cannot be aligned to ncbi build  <dig>  refseq genes and est sequences, indicating that there are still missing genes expressed beyond them. some of those novel transcript contigs are conserved among human, chimpanzee and macaque, and they might be transcribed from the functional genes that absent from the human reference genome. by locating those contigs onto the human genome, we found some large deletions of human reference genome. using rt-pcr, we validated six of those conserved novel transcript contigs expressed in three different types of normal human cells.

our findings show that about a hundred refseq genes that are unalignable to grch <dig> are expressed and a significant number of our identified novel transcript contigs could be positioned to grch <dig>  suggesting that those refseq genes and novel transcript contigs were from the gaps or misassembled regions of grch <dig>  some of our identified novel transcript contigs could be found more than one match locations on huref or celera genomes, indicating that those contigs might be caused by cnvs or were transcribed from the repetitive or homologous sequences. in addition, there are still a portion of identified novel transcript contigs that could not be located to grch <dig> or huref or celera genomes, implying that some of them might be specific to caucasian and belong to the population or individual specific transcript sequences. accordingly, due to the limitations of technologies and computational approaches, many reasons could lead to specific sequences missing from the human reference genome. these include:  the collection of the sequencing samples might be incomplete or even contaminated;  the different sequencing technologies have certain bias in genome sequencing, and some genomic regions like at-rich and gc-rich regions are difficult to sequence  <cit> ;  the genomic sequences, especially mammalian genomes are very complex and might contain large amounts of repetitive and homologous sequences;  the assembly algorithms also have limitations for whole genome assembling and hardly assemble the sequencing reads into complete sequences  <cit> ;  individual specific sequences could also contribute to the unalignable phenomena to the human reference genome and etc.

the sequencing technologies are undergoing fast development, it is expected that sequencing accuracy, read length and sequencing depths will be greatly improved  <cit> . in addition, many powerful bioinformatics algorithms are expected to be developed. these new developments will enable us to explore the structure of human genome more comprehensively and accurately, and realize personalized medicine in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that there are still a significant amount of human genes not incorporated into the human reference genome, and their absence would result in the incomplete recognition of human genomics or transcriptomics. our findings also show the importance of de novo assembly of transcriptome, which could help us to further explore the missing sequences beyond the reference genome. in addition, our study indicates that comparative analysis of human reference genome with other assembled human genomes provides an alternative approach to refine the human reference genome. to thoroughly explore and comprehensively understand the human genome, it is crucial to continue to refine the human reference genome, and to identify and characterize the genes that are not present in the reference genome.
