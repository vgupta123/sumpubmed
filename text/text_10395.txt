BACKGROUND
the pig is one of the most important agriculture animals, which has provided the largest amount of consumable red meat protein. the pig is also a valuable model for studying human diseases because pigs are more similar in genomic structure to human than mice are  <cit> . pigs are used as models in genetics analysis and gene knockout or knock-in studies of human diseases such as cystic fibrosis, alzheimer’s disease, and brca1-associated mammary carcinogenesis. genetic studies of pig models of human diseases led to the identification of novel quantitative trait loci for cutaneous melanoma and a novel mutation in the ldl receptor that contributes to spontaneous hypercholesterolemia  <cit> . gene expression profiling in pig models led to the identification of rack <dig> as a potential marker of malignancy for human melanocytic proliferation  <cit> . the pig has also been used to study autoimmune, congenital, and bone diseases, as well as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension.

however, the genetic similarity between pig and human has not been assessed in large, systematic studies. thus, pigs may be underused as models for human diseases. here we surveyed about 500 f <dig> animals in a swine cross using a high density 60 k snp array and examined phenotypic traits of interests to both agriculture and human diseases, including anemia traits, limb bone length, and number of ribs.

integrated network or systems biology approaches, which combine genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data into network views, have been applied to understand obesity  <cit> , cancers  <cit> , and other human diseases. integrated network approaches are powerful tools for analyzing complex high-throughput data. they have provided many new insights into diseases  <cit>  and identified many novel candidate genes that cause human diseases  <cit> , and were later validated experimentally  <cit> .

by applying integrated analysis on phenotypic traits and genotype data, we show that both swine and human genome wide association candidates for anemia traits are related to lipid metabolism in liver. by integrating phenotype and genotype data with human adipose bayesian causal network, we identified plag <dig> for limb bone length . we then integrated genetic association result and human protein-protein interaction network to identify two novel candidate causal genes tgfb <dig> and dab2ip as well as the known regulators mesp <dig> and mesp <dig> as responsible for the variation in rib number and illustrated the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. tgfb <dig> knockout together with tgfb <dig> in mice decreases number of ribs, which supports tgfb <dig> as a regulator for rib number in pig.

RESULTS
a large-scale f <dig> intercross comprising  <dig>  pigs was constructed by crossing the western breed white duroc and the chinese breed erhualian  <cit> . these breeds differ in growth, fat, meat quality, and other phenotypic traits. phenotypic traits including anemia traits, number of ribs and limb bone length were measured at day  <dig> .

high density snp genotypes for  <dig> f <dig> animals were successfully generated. of  <dig>  snps ,  <dig>  informative snps were selected for further analysis based on their call rates, minor allele frequencies, and hardy-weinberg equilibrium  tests . the average distance between informative snp markers was  <dig> kb . we therefore defined the most likely regions of major loci as regions within  <dig> kb on each site of the most significant snps in genome-wide association results. to scan phenotypes against the genome-wide snp genotype data for association between trait and snp, we used the single-marker mixed model  <cit>  . at a false discovery rate  <5% , there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for anemia, bone length, and rib number traits, respectively. then, we applied systems biology approach to identify potential causal genes underlying qtls of phenotype traits.

causal genes for anemia traits
hematopoietic disorders are associated with a variety of human diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and liver diseases. one founder breed of our f <dig> resource population, the white duroc pig, has the dominant coat color and lower hemoglobin concentration, an indicator of macrocytic anemia  <cit> . two blood parameters related to macrocytic anemia, mean corpuscular volume  and mean corpuscular hemoglobin  at day  <dig>  were recorded for this f <dig> cross. since mcv and mch are tightly correlated , we used mch as the representative of anemia traits in the downstream analysis. we previously identified a significant qtl for mch at day  <dig> in a 3-cm region on ssc <dig> using  <dig> microsatellite markers  <cit> . in the current study, the snp association results of mch revealed  <dig> significant loci ; the strongest association was on ssc <dig> , as in our previous results. the qtl for mch peaked at snp marker marc <dig> . the  <dig> kb flanking region on each side of the marker contains only one gene, kit, a finding which suggests kit is the causal gene for mch at locus ssc8: <dig>  mb. kit regulatory mutations, including a gene duplication and a splice mutation that leads to the skipping of exon  <dig>  are responsible for the dominant white phenotype in pigs  <cit> . these regulatory mutations have profound pleiotropic effects on peripheral blood cell measures in western commercial pigs  <cit> . the second strongest association was centered at marc <dig> . the  <dig> kb flanking region on each side contains only one gene, aco <dig>  which encodes aconitase  <dig>  also known as iron regulatory element binding protein  <dig> , aco <dig> regulates cellular iron homeostasis and is linked to anemia in human  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
comparison of pig and human genetic architecture of anemia related traits such as mean corpuscular hemoglobin . a) pig snp association result for mch. there is a strong qtl at chromosome  <dig> along with  <dig> other significant qtls. the black line represents a p-value threshold  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  corresponding to fdr =  <dig> . b). both pig genome wide association candidates  and human gwas candidate  for mch are in a liver subnetwork that involves in lipid metabolism. hepcidin  is a sensor for iron and inflammation. the subnetwork provides a molecular link between anemia and lipid metabolism.



in addition, there were multiple significant qtls for mch, suggesting complex genetic regulation of the mch trait. multiple loci for mch have been identified in human gwas  <cit>  . however, only one gene, kit, was present in the candidate sets from human gwas and from our swine cross. bone marrow, kidney, and liver are important tissues for red blood cell production and homeostasis. instead of directly comparing the two candidate sets from swine and human, we examined how these genes are regulated in a human liver transcriptional network .  <dig> swine and  <dig> human gwas candidates for mch were included in the human liver network. the average shortest distances were  <dig>  and  <dig> , corresponding to empirical p-values =  <dig>  and  <dig>   for the swine and human gwas candidates, respectively, suggesting the swine candidate genes were likely to be transcriptionally co-regulated in human liver. we then sought to determine whether candidate genes identified in swine and human gwas involve in similar subnetworks and similar biological processes. subnetworks around swine candidates for mch were significantly enriched in the gene ontology  biological process cellular lipid metabolism  while subnetworks around human gwas candidates were enriched in the go biological processes immune response and lipid metabolism  . the enrichment of multiple go biological processes in the human gwas candidates subnetwork explains why human gwas candidates were not significantly co-regulated in the human liver network as a whole . the swine candidate subnetwork and human candidate subnetwork overlapped significantly , and genes in the go biological process cellular lipid metabolism were even more enriched when considering the two subnetworks together  . anemia has been linked to lipid profiles such as cholesterol and apolipoprotein levels, triglycerides, and lipid peroxidation in both animal and human studies  <cit> . many genes in the anemia-associated subnetwork we identified participate in diverse lipid-related functions, such as cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid transport, and lipid oxidation, providing mechanistic support for the phenotypic connections between anemia and lipid metabolism. in addition, anemia, inflammation, and obesity have been linked in many studies  <cit>  and are linked transcriptionally  <cit> . hepcidin  is a body sensor for iron and inflammation  <cit>  and is increased in obese individuals  <cit> , which is a potential molecular connection between anemia and inflammation.

in sum, our results suggest that both swine and human candidate genes for the anemia trait mch involve in a similar subnetwork related to lipid metabolism, which supports a link between anemia and obesity.

identification of plag <dig> and hmga <dig> as causal genes for pig limb bone length and human height
human height is a typical polygenic trait. hundreds of loci that affect human height have been identified in gwas  <cit> . however, there are no good models for studying mechanisms by which these loci affect human height. we illustrated here that qtls for the length of pig limb bones are in good concordance with human gwas results, suggesting that the pig is such a model.

two loci were strongly associated with limb bone length . these loci were centered at ssc4: <dig>  mb and ssc7: <dig>  mb with p-values of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively, consistent with the result of a previous qtl study on the length of individual bones  <cit> . the flanking regions  of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> loci contain  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes , respectively. leg length is generally proportional to height. our results are similar to those of gwas of human height. the syntenic regions on human genome of the two loci we identified in pigs matched perfectly with two human loci  associated with human height in gwas  <cit> . the concordant results of genetic studies of pig and human indicate that these loci have profound effects on bone development, so it is worth identifying causal candidate genes at these loci. hmga <dig>  has been suggested as the causal gene for height, possibly through a mechanism involving modification of chromatin structure  <cit> . however, it is unclear which gene or genes at locus 8q <dig> are causal for human height  <cit> . therefore, we compared subnetworks around swine candidate genes with the subnetwork derived from genes known to affect human height.figure  <dig>

we selected  <dig> genes potentially related to human height on the basis of their disease associations in the omim database . osteoblasts and adipocytes are very close in cell lineage  <cit>  and can be converted to each other by molecular signals  <cit> . subnetworks in a human gene regulatory network for omental fat representing a bone regulatory network  were extracted by using the  <dig> omim genes as seeds .  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were included in the omental fat network. the largest subnetwork in figure 2b contained  <dig> of the  <dig> omim genes, which indicates that height related genes are coherently regulated in ometal fat. using genes at the human 8q <dig> locus as seeds, we extracted subnetworks from the omental fat network as well . there were two subnetworks, one centered on lyn and one on plag <dig>  only plag <dig> subnetwork overlapped with the height-related omim gene subnetwork:  <dig> of  <dig> nodes were in the omim subnetwork . this result strongly suggests that plag <dig> is a candidate gene at the 8q <dig> locus. plag <dig> knockout mice have reduced litter weight and retarded embryonic and postnatal growth  <cit> , which further implicates plag <dig> in regulating body size. in addition, variants modulating the expression of a chromosome domain encompassing plag <dig> influence stature in cattle  <cit> . some studies suggest that plag <dig> is associated with human height  <cit> , while others suggest sdr16c <dig> as the causal gene at the 8q <dig> locus  <cit> . our network analysis result objectively indicates that plag <dig> is a causal gene for human height.

identification of tgfb <dig>  dap2ip, mesp <dig>  and mesp <dig> as causal genes for the number of ribs
pigs have  <dig> to  <dig> ribs  <cit> , and meat production increases with extra ribs  <cit> . in human, one extra rib can increase cancer risk by 120-fold  <cit> . previous studies indicate that loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> affect the number of ribs in pigs  <cit> . the number of vertebrae and the number of ribs are tightly correlated. two major qtls for the number of vertebrae were found on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , and nr6a <dig> and vrtn were suggested as the causal genes underlying the two loci, respectively  <cit> . in our f <dig> intercross, we recorded rib number, and tested its association with the snp genotypes. our snp association results  also revealed two loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> figure  <dig>

the chromosome  <dig> locus had the strongest association with rib number  and is centered on marker alga <dig> at  <dig>  mb . genes within the flanking region  of the snp marker are tgfb <dig>  ift <dig> , and c14orf <dig>  the chromosome  <dig> locus  is centered on the marker drga <dig> at  <dig>  mb. the flanking region  contains one gene, dab2ip.

to prioritize the candidate genes at these loci, we explored the network structures around them. transcriptional regulatory networks of mature tissues may not reflect regulation during early embryo development. however, protein-protein interactions  are not identified in a specific physiological state and thus may capture interactions or regulations during embryonic development. we therefore collected ppis from multiple sources . the ppi subnetwork around the candidate genes  was significantly enriched for genes in the kegg wnt signaling pathway . in the early development of vertebrate embryos, the thoracic spine forms during somitogenesis, a process controlled by segmentation clock, whose key regulators include notch, wnt, and fgf  <cit>  . we found that tgfb <dig> and dab2ip interact with genes in the wnt signaling pathway in the ppi subnetwork , suggesting that these genes are the candidate genes for the two loci.

tgfb <dig> and tgfb <dig> overlap in function and compensate for each other. in tgfb <dig> knockout mice, tgfb <dig> regulates rib number. tgfb3+/− and tgfb3−/− mice have fewer ribs than their wildtype littermates  <cit> . tgfb <dig> plays a key role in embryogenesis, and abnormalities in this and other genes in the fgf pathway contribute to human diseases such as oral cleft  <cit> . dab2ip  interacts with dab <dig>  <cit> . dab <dig> plays an essential role in mesoderm differentiation  <cit>  and inhibits wnt/beta-catenin signaling in embryos  <cit> . a beta-catenin  gradient determines the arrest of clock oscillation and maturation of somitogenesis  <cit> . besides affecting the common wnt signaling pathway, tgfb regulates the translation of dab <dig> mrna  <cit> . we hypothesized that both loci influence rib number by interacting with the wnt signaling pathway and then affecting the beta-catenin gradient and maturation of somitogenesis .

somitogenesis is regulated by the notch, wnt and fgf pathways  <cit> . the mechanisms of both potential regulators, tgfb <dig> and dab2ip, are related to the wnt and fgf pathways but not to the notch pathway. to further explore causal regulators for the number of ribs, we regressed the number of ribs on the genotypes at tgfb <dig> and dab2ip loci using the following model y = μ + sex + batch + g + gtgfb <dig> + gdab2ip + e, where y is the number of ribs, μ is the mean, g is the kinship, gtgfb <dig> and gdab2ip are the genotypes at the tgfb <dig> and dab2ip loci, and e is the residual. we then tested whether other loci and their interactions with tgfb <dig> and dab2ip loci explain the residual variance e using the following models e ~ g + g * gtgfb <dig> and e ~ g + g * gdab2ip. at snp marker dbkk <dig> , there was one locus whose genotype and interaction with the tgfb <dig> locus was associated with the residual variance  . the flanking region of this locus contains eight genes: wdr <dig>  plin <dig>  pex11a, mesp <dig>  mesp <dig>  c7h15orf <dig>  apn, and ap2s <dig>  among them, mesp <dig> and mesp <dig> are known regulators in somitogenesis  <cit> , during which mesp <dig> is a key regulator of the notch pathway  <cit> . thus, mesp <dig> and mesp <dig> are likely to be causal genes at this locus for rib number in pigs and they interact with the tgfb <dig> locus to regulate both the notch and wnt signaling pathways.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study shows that causal genes for traits of interests to both agriculture and human diseases can be identified by combining high-density snp genotyping and systems biology approaches. by comparing pig and human candidate genes from gwas for phenotypic traits related to anemia, bone length , and rib number, we identified putative causal genes and uncovered the mechanisms for these phenotypes. specifically, we showed that both human and pig causal genes for anemia are related to lipid metabolism in liver. we confirmed that hmga <dig> and plag <dig> are candidate genes for bone length, which corresponds to human height.

in genomic structure  <cit>  and physiologically, pigs are more similar to humans than are mice, one of the most widely used models for human pathophysiology studies. pig organs are similar to their human counterparts in size and shape and are a potential source for human organ transplants. humans and pigs also have similar blood lipid profiles, whereas mice lack high density lipoprotein  particles. a study based on a complete pig genome assembly  <cit>  shows that selection pressure in pigs is closer to that in humans than in mice. the dn/ds ratio  is  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the pig, human, and mouse, respectively  <cit> . these lines of evidence suggest that the pig is a good model for studying complex human diseases. indeed, we found that genetic complexity of human disease related traits in the pig is similar to the complexity in human. for example,  <dig> loci are significantly associated with mch/mcv in human gwas  <cit> . we found  <dig> loci associated with mch at genome-wide significance in the pig. in contrast, only one or two loci are associated with mch in mouse crosses  <cit> . on the other hand, the mouse is still an important model for biomedical research and has unique advantages, including a shorter life and hence experimental cycle, greater availability of genetic, genomic, and molecular resources, and ease of genetic manipulation. the mouse is also a better model for target validation. thousands of knockout or transgenic mice have been generated, and can be used to assess physiological and molecular changes due to genetic perturbations.

even though there are  <dig> naturally occurring disease-causing mutations common to humans and pigs  <cit> , a large overlap between most of disease causal loci in the two species is unlikely. humans and pigs are under different selection pressures. since naturally occurring snps differ in the two species, gwas candidate loci in the two species may not significantly overlap when compared directly. the systems genetics and integrative network approach we used here is suitable for identifying potential causal genes underlying loci associated with complex human disease and, more importantly, to uncover potential biological processes underlying these causal loci.

for the rib number trait, we identified candidate genes in the wnt and notch pathways, which are known to influence rib development including tgfb <dig> and dab2ip as well as the known genes mesp <dig> and mesp <dig>  using network approaches, we not only identified candidate genes, but also further dissected the mechanisms that mediate their effects on the phenotype. abnormal rib number is associated with at least  <dig> different human diseases and syndromes , such as herrmann-opitz craniosynostosis, spondylocostal dysostosis, and campomelia cumming type. in humans, one extra rib in human can increase cancer risks 120-fold  <cit> . our network analysis of the number of pig ribs not only revealed good markers for selecting pig breeds, but also showed that the pig is a good model for studying embryogenesis process in general and human congenital diseases.

an snp in nr6a <dig> has been implicated as the causal gene for vertebrae number at the chromosome  <dig> locus  <cit> . we genotyped this snp and compared the genotypes of other snps in the chromosome  <dig> region. the genotypes of the nr6a <dig> snp and those around nr6a <dig> on the 60 k chip were similar . specifically, the genotypes of the nr6a <dig> snp and snp marker drga <dig>  were 90% identical. in addition, the nr6a <dig> snp and the neighboring snps on the 60 k snp array had similar association results, and the nr6a <dig> snp explained less variation in rib number than drga <dig> , for which dab2ip was implicated as the candidate causal gene in our study. these results suggest that dab2ip is also likely to be a causal gene for rib number.

in addition to the three traits analyzed in the systems genetics study, there are over  <dig> phenotypic traits related to growth, fatness  <cit> , meat quality  <cit> , blood lipid profiles  <cit> , and body strength  <cit>  in the swine f <dig> cross. the three complex traits  are not well studied in other animal models and are highly relevant to complex human diseases. by applying systems genetics and integrative network approaches, we were able to identify putative causal genes and mechanisms underlying the snps associated with these traits. however, systems biology approaches have some limitations in identifying causal genes of phenotypic traits. if gene expression data from relevant tissues is unavailable, one must rely on published networks and ppi networks, which have not been linked to many novel genes. in this case, the ability to find truly novel causal genes is limited. alternative approaches such as genome-wide rnai screening are needed to complement the systems biology approach.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results show that humans and pigs share similar genetic architecture for complex traits, providing proof of concept for using swine as a model organism for complex human diseases. furthermore, the coherent genetic and phenotypic data generated in the study can provide a rich resource for future agriculture and human disease studies.
