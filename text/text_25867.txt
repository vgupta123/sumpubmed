BACKGROUND
neuroendocrine neoplasms  or nets represent 1-2% of all neoplasia and are comparable in incidence to testicular cancer, gliomas and hodgkin’s lymphoma  <cit> . the most common variety, constituting approximately 29% of all nets, develops within the small intestine or “midgut” and are the most common tumor of the small intestine  <cit> . although previously considered to be benign, they are indolent cancers  exhibiting a better survivals than adenocarcinomas of the same location  <cit> . although their biological behavior is generally non-aggressive, metastatic invasion is evident in 50% of tumors <1 cm  <cit> . the modest prognosis reflects the inherent clinical difficulty in diagnosis of small intestinal malignancy; disease may often have been present for some time before identification  <cit> .

nets are considered to be derived from neuroendocrine cells within the diffuse neuroendocrine system  <cit> . like normal neuroendocrine cells, tumors exhibit a functional secretory apparatus e.g., chromogranins and proteins involved in amine uptake e.g., vmats, as well as vesicular trafficking and fusions e.g., snap <dig> . in addition, well-described signaling pathways involving g-protein coupled receptors such as somatostatin and dopamine have been defined e.g., camp/pka  <cit> . these have provided the basis for establishment of a histological classification, the development of targeted agents e.g., peptide receptor radiotherapy, as well as imaging strategies that utilize identification of cellular amine uptake mechanisms  <cit> . the transcriptomic basis of tumor development and malignancy, however, remains largely unknown.

chromosomal-based studies  <cit>  e.g., cgh and high resolution snp arrays  <cit>  and molecular profiling through exome analyses have identified alterations e.g., loss of 18q22-mer  <cit>  or smad <dig> loh  <cit> , that may be associated with neuroendocrine neoplasia. similarly, gene expression profiling has identified a plethora of “marker genes” that include nap1l <dig>  <cit> , nkx2- <dig>  <cit> , tgfβr <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . however, no studies have been undertaken to generate an integrated molecular view of these neoplasms – the “interactome”. the relevance of such an analysis is that the delineation of the transcriptome, as a global measure, offers a complete overview of the cellular machinery at an rna level – the cellular “toolbox”. this information provides the basis whereby network analysis can be utilized to identify specific interactive pathways associated with e.g., proliferation and metastasis rather than individual components. the establishment of the integrative pathways regulating the biological functions that constitute malignancy will likely have substantial translational applications.

transcriptomic analysis can thus be utilized to provide a better understanding of tumor development as well as neoplasia. such analyses have been demonstrated to be of considerable utility in other tumor types e.g., breast, particularly when translated to the clinical setting. thus, considerable advance has occurred by upgrading histopathology, where gene-based analyses have allowed for the development of pcr-based arrays as well as custom-built chips to assess breast cancer classification , metastases  <cit>  as well as predict therapeutic responsiveness  <cit> . circulating tumor cells can readily be detected through pcr applications – such approaches appear to be more sensitive than current capture-based techniques – and may be more informative especially because multiple, biologically informative genes identified from rna analyses can be assessed e.g., in non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> , prostate cancer  <cit>  or colon cancer  <cit> . finally, a logical framework for the development of therapeutic targets can be generated through in silico-based reverse engineering of transcriptome data – this has previously been used to identify signaling pathways e.g., creb targets  <cit>  as well as master regulators – cardinal, potentially targetable genes that regulate nodes in pathways  <cit> .

given the absence of any large-scale transcriptome study and the lack of analytical homogeneity between different net transcriptome studies, we reanalyzed two publically available small intestinal net microarray datasets  <cit>  . in order to identify genes that constitute the intestinal “network”, we used a strategy that included stringent quality control techniques consistent with differential expression and validated network-based approaches . thereafter, we undertook qpcr to corroborate transcript alterations in candidate targets in an independent collection of nets. finally, we screened public databases  and published literature  to focus on validated signaling pathways and critical transcription factors. this approach allowed us to confirm or reconsider known disruptions in signaling pathways in small intestinal nets and identify pathways involved in development as well as novel transcription targets with putative therapeutic and biomarker potential.

pcr validation in independent set
qpcr analysis confirmed up regulated expression of 13/ <dig>  genes in small intestinal nets compared to normal mucosa. of the most expressed genes , scg <dig> , pcsk <dig> , scn3a , pnma <dig> , nkx2- <dig> , bex <dig>  and aplp <dig>  were all highly expressed as was the transcription factor st <dig>  . transcripts associated with the cosmic database and predicted to be down-regulated included sdhd  and cebpa  . core regulatory genes involved in neurodevelopment were also expressed  .

discussion
the precise basis of small intestinal tumor genomic profile has proven to be a complex subject and an integrated, cellular transcriptomic appreciation of neuroendocrine tumors has heretofore not been possible. this reflects a number of issues namely the paucity of studies available, the low number of tumor samples analyzed, the divergent analytical tools utilized and dissimilar focuses of the investigative groups e.g., focus on identifying metastatic genes  <cit> . we sought to define the issue using an integrated transcriptome analysis based on gene network-approaches that has successfully been proven to identify associations not previously apparent . additionally, while it is likely that the current paradigm in tumor sequencing calls for tumor samples to be matched with control samples from the same individual  <cit> , we hypothesized that comparing diverse population may shed light on tumor-specific behavior rather than on sample-specific behavior. overall, the information derived  demonstrates four areas of novelty and considerable interest. firstly, expression of core regulatory secretory regulatory elements, including genes involved in depolarization, was identified. the data therefore provide a complete overview of genes involved in regulated secretion and demonstrate the conservation of secretory apparatus in these tumors. secondly, a set of transcription factors associated with neurodevelopmental processes including insm <dig>  nkx2- <dig> and bex <dig> were identified indicating that the regulation of neuroendocrine differentiation occurs in tumors and that aberrations of this process may be of biological relevance in the evolution of the neoplastic phenotype. thirdly, we confirmed loss of sdhd expression, a phenomenon associated with “benign” conditions in other tumors e.g., paragangliomas  <cit> . finally, our data may suggest that at a genomic level small intestinal nets may be distinguished by at least two distinct, secretory subtypes, serotonin-producing neoplasms and serotonin/substance p -producing lesions. as such, this is supported by previous studies in small intestinal nets with “carcinoid syndrome” i.e., produce excess serotonin which suggests at least two subtypes of tumors. these include: 1) the demonstration that elevated luminal concentrations of substance p  are only measured in 12% of patients  <cit> ; 2) fasting circulating substance p concentrations are elevated in <20% of carcinoids  <cit> ; and 3) at least two distinct serotonin producing net lesions have been identified – serotonin producing nets in the pancreas are tac1/substance p negative  <cit> .

serotonin-secreting tumors 
genome-wide co-expression analysis of these lesions  <cit>  revealed processes including ‘nervous system development’ , ‘immune response’ , and ‘cell-cycle’ . importantly, gene network topology and differential expression analysis identified over-expression of the gpcr signaling regulators, camp synthetase , and the protein kinase a, prkar1a. adcy <dig> was confirmed to be elevated in expression in our independent set; prkar1a and the role of camp-signaling have been previously studied in detail  <cit> .

serotonin/substance p -secreting tumors 
a reanalysis of the microarray data  <cit>  identified over-expression of common genes with set  <dig> including aplp <dig>  scn3a, bex, insm <dig> and st <dig>  however, the most highly and uniquely expressed gene was tac <dig>  or substance p/tachykinins. our secretory subnetwork analysis suggests that these tumors may not be classical serotonin-producing lesions.

combinatorial-analysis
this interactome assessment of the highly expressed genes identified canonical elements of secretory regulation including secretogranins, vesicle trafficking and hormone processing. the chromogranins , secretogranins , and additional related proteins e.g., pcsk <dig> and  <dig> , pnma <dig> , aplp <dig> , as well as carboxypeptidase e  have essential roles in the regulated secretory pathway or as products of this pathway  <cit> . elevated expression of these genes was confirmed by qpcr in an independent set and provides evidence corroborating the secretome fingerprint of the tumor cells. of interest was the identification of high expression of scn3a . this tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel gene mediates membrane depolarization in excitable cells  <cit> . this suggests that this gene may be involved in regulating aspects of neuroendocrine secretion which mechanistically require a depolarization event. it is clinically well recognized that small intestinal tumors are sensitized to paroxysmal increased release of serotonin or substance p/tachykinins by secretagogues  <cit> . in this respect, nav <dig>  is increased in expression following nerve injury with the concomitant phenomenon of hyperalgesia in dorsal root ganglia  <cit> . we speculate that this elevated expression of nav <dig>  in neuroendocrine tumors may be related.

an assessment of the twenty-nine enteroendocrine-related transcription factors  <cit>  identified that st <dig>  insm <dig> and nkx2- <dig> were commonly expressed in both tumor sets. st <dig>  is a candidate tumor suppressor in breast cancer; ectopic expression in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells strongly inhibits colony formation in soft agar and the formation of tumors in a xenograft mouse model  <cit> ; it is also known to function as an pro-apoptotic effector  <cit> . this gene, however, is involved in neuronal differentiation  <cit>  as well as in normal pancreatic islet cell development  <cit> . interactome analysis of small intestinal net transcriptomes identified neuroendocrine developmental pathways to be a key feature of these lesions. insm <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  and neurod <dig> were all identified to co-exist and elevated expression levels of these genes were confirmed by qpcr. identification of other genes for example, tbx family members, in each transcriptome dataset supports a common activation of developmental pathways in these lesions and suggested the existence of a network of transactivating factors that function together to regulate the neuroendocrine phenotype. further support for this is provided by over-expression of bex <dig> which is considered a regeneration-associated gene  <cit>  and may be involved in tumorigenesis  <cit> . bex <dig> is epigenetically activated in neurosphere cells and is considered relevant as a marker of reactivation of stem cell and pluripotency-associated genes; bex <dig> expression enlarges the differentiation potential of precursor cells  <cit> . these data suggest that transcription factors that regulate neuroendocrine cell development or lineage specification are upregulated in neuroendocrine tumors as has been noted in lung tumors  <cit> . this may indicate an active control of the neuroendocrine phenotype in tumors but also raises the question as to whether an abnormal phenotype  could occur as a consequence of a disruption in the tfs  that co-ordinate the neurodevelopmental pathway. a similar phenomenon has been identified for tumor progenitor cells in small cell lung cancer  <cit> .

at a developmental level, insm <dig>  apart from regulating neural and olfactory development  <cit> , is essential for proper specification of both gastrointestinal and pancreatic endocrine cells  <cit>  through interruption of cell cycle signaling, and cellular proliferation inhibition  <cit> . endocrine transdifferentiation in bon cells is mediated by insm <dig> through activation of ngn <dig>  <cit> . the plasticity of the neuroendocrine phenotype is controlled by nkx2- <dig> which regulates cell fate choices within the intestinal enteroendocrine population  <cit> . when this transcription factor is down-regulated, pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell development is impaired; the ghrelin-expressing cell population, in contrast, is augmented  <cit> . upregulation of nkx2- <dig> is considered one of the primary regulatory events required for the maintenance of beta-cell identity  <cit> . although the precise role of these genes in nets is unclear, given the known roles in neuroendocrine development, it seems plausible that activation of neuroedevelopmental pathway  can be implicated in net proliferation. insm <dig>  at least, functions through disruption of the cell cycle by targeting the cdk4/cyclind <dig> complex.

a second gene linked to this complex is cebpa . this is a basic/leucine zipper transcription factor that integrates transcription with proliferation to regulate the differentiation of tissues involved in energy balance. in the pituitary, c/ebpalpha functions to prolong the cell cycle in g <dig> and s in pituitary progenitor cells  <cit> . an assessment of the  <dig> genes in the cosmic database verified to be associated in a dominant or recessive fashion with cancer identified that cebpa was down-regulated in both net groups we studied. qpcr confirmed decreased expression of this gene . loss of function of this gene is associated with aml and mds, largely through regulation of differentiation; this gene product inhibits cdk2/ <dig> and the cyclin d <dig> pathway  <cit> . we postulate that a similar mechanism exists in small intestinal nets; elevations in cdks and cyclin expression are well-recognized in nets particularly as a consequence of igf- <dig> stimulation  <cit> . it is noteworthy that inhibition of proliferation using interferons specifically inhibits these effectors in vitro
 <cit> .

a consistent loss or decrease in expression of sdhd, a recessive gene involved in paragangliomas, was noted in both tumor sets. mutations in sdhd result in loss of complex ii function and are associated with loss of stabilization of hif <dig> under normoxia and generation of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . mutations in this gene are considered to result in a “benign” phenotype in paraganglioma, the mechanisms of which are considered to be due to activation of cellular hypoxia responses  <cit> . although no mutations have been detected in sdhd in intestinal nets  <cit> , loh has been identified in ~30% of lesions  <cit> . interestingly, loh alone could lead to a complete loss of function since sdhd is an imprinted gene  <cit> . qpcr, in an independent dataset, confirmed decreased expression  of sdhd indicating a potential role for hypoxia in intestinal tumor biology.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified two subtypes of intestinal neuroendocrine tumors, both associated with metastases, that express common signaling pathways involved in neuroendocrine secretion, nervous system and neuroendocrine development, as well as hypoxia and cyclin/cdk <dig> regulation. transcriptome analyses have previously been leveraged to identify markers either of metastases  <cit>  or blood-based antigens  <cit>  or circulating transcripts  <cit> . the latter has evolved from a single transcript approach to a multiple gene screen –  <dig> marker genes – that are closely correlated with neuroendocrine tumor biology  <cit>  and overlap with genes e.g., aplp <dig> family, pnma <dig> and cd <dig>  in the current study. detection of this enhanced gene signature has been shown to be significantly more effective than measurements of chromogranin a by elisa as a peripheral blood tool for detecting nets  <cit> . in addition, because it is based on assessment of multiple net transcriptomes it is also effective at identifying all gastroenteropancreatic lesions irrespective of the organ of origin and tumors including in the absence of metastasis.

this manuscript provides an integrated transcriptomic view of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors and identifies that these lesions are regulated at a developmental level, have key activation of hypoxic pathways  as well as activation of genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation. further analyses and leverage of these data should provide novel tissue and blood-based tools to better understand, diagnose and ultimately treat these neoplasms.
