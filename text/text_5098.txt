BACKGROUND
citrus is one of the most important fruit crops in the world with a total production of  <dig> million tons in  <dig>  <cit> . citrus fruits are hesperidium berries with a very special organization composed of two morphologically distinct regions: the pericarp  and the endocarp , which is the edible portion of the fruit and consists of segments, the ovarian locules, containing the juice vesicles. growth and development of citrus fruit follows a sigmoid curve divided into three stages  <cit> . after an initial two months interval of slow growth mostly due to cell division , most of the fruit growth results from cell enlargement and water accumulation during the next  <dig> to  <dig> months . finally, during phase iii, growth is mostly arrested and fruits undergo a non-climacteric ripening process. research on citrus fruit ripening has received considerable attention because of both the uniqueness of this physiological process and the importance of citrus fruits for the human diet as a supply of ascorbic acid, fibre and several phytochemicals with contrasted benefits for health  <cit> .

although color break, the pivotal metabolic event characterizing external ripening, takes place during phase iii  <cit> ; internal quality traits are acquired along both phases ii and iii  <cit> . during the first half of phase ii, citrus fruits accumulate a considerable amount of organic acids in the vacuoles of the juice sac cells and these acids are progressively catabolized during the second half of phases ii and iii  <cit> . the physiological roles of organic acids in fruit cells are not fully understood, although it has been suggested that low ph could result in an enhanced sink strength, increasing carbohydrate uptake  <cit> . the characteristic decline in titrable acidity shown by many citrus fruits is due to the utilization of citric acid, the most abundant organic acid in citrus juice  <cit> .

mature citrus pulp contains a high percentage of water and many other different constituents, including acids and sugars among other determinants of taste and organoleptic quality  <cit> . thus, the control of fruit acidity loss has a strong economical relevance since it is related to the consumer perception and hence constitutes a main constraint for the citrus industry. recent advances in this field resulted in the identification of the main metabolic processes involved in citrate utilization  <cit>  including a tonoplast citrate/h+ symporter potentially involved in citrate efflux from the vacuole  <cit> . according to the current hypothesis, indirectly supported by proteomic data  <cit> , citrate is released from the vacuole into the cytosol and then sequentially isomerized into isocitrate by cytosolic aconitase and then metabolized into 2-oxoglutarate by nadp+-isocitrate dehydrogenase. the utilization of 2-oxoglutarate involves transamination into glutamate and then either conversion into glutamine and further utilization for thiamine biosynthesis, or conversion into succinate through the gamma-aminobutirate shunt, eventually leading to carbohydrate synthesis. alternatively, citrate may be converted to oxaloacetate and acetyl-coa in a reaction catalyzed by atp citrate lyase. however, since a decrease in atp citrate lyase mrna level during citrus fruit ripening has been reported  <cit>  all steps involved in citrate utilization are initially dependent on its isomerization into isocitrate, the step controlled by aconitase.

aconitase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via the intermediate product cis-aconitate. two isoforms of aconitase have been detected in all eukaryotic cells: mitochondrial aconitase that is involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and cytosolic aconitase that participates in several processes, such as cytosolic citrate metabolism  <cit>  and the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . it is also worth mentioning that aconitases are multifunctional proteins. in addition to the enzymatic activity, it has been shown, for instance, that the yeast mitochondrial aconitase is a component of the mitochondrial nucleoid and interacts with mitochondrial dna  <cit> , while the cytosolic aconitase has rna binding activity related to iron homeostasis in animals and to resistance to oxidative stress in both animals and plants  <cit> .

the aconitate hydratase family has been only described in detail in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, the large number of vegetal genomes sequenced to completion in the last years allows performing extensive phylogenetic analysis in these species. besides the ones from arabidopsis, rice  <cit> , poplar  <cit>  and vitis  <cit> , released several years ago, the genome sequences from many other plants are now available, and only during  <dig> and the beginning of  <dig> the genomes of corn  <cit> , sorghum <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and false purplebrome  <cit>  have been completely sequenced. in this work, we have first characterized the aconitase gene family of citrus and performed, taking advantage of the availability of complete genome sequences, a phylogenetic analysis of the aconitate hydratase family in  <dig> species, which allowed an unprecedented view of the evolutionary history of this family in plants. in addition, the role of the citrus aconitase genes in the acid homeostasis has been investigated studying their expression in several acidic and acidless citrus genotypes.

RESULTS
molecular characterization of the citrus aconitate hydratase genes
in order to identify cdnas coding for aco proteins, a blastx search was performed against  <dig>  citrus ests available at the genbank, using the arabidopsis thaliana aco proteins as queries.  <dig> ests produced significant similarity with the arabidopsis aco proteins, using an e value cut off of 1e- <dig>  assembly of the reads with gap <dig> resulted in all the ests but one clustering into  <dig> contigs. the only singleton corresponded to a putative immature mrna with an intron that prevented its assembly. the fact that all the ests clustered into  <dig> unigenes strongly supports that the aconitate hydratase family from citrus is composed, at least, of three transcription units. three genes have been also reported in a. thaliana, the only plant species in which this family has been described in detail  <cit> .

one cdna clone representing each transcription unit was selected from a normalized full length library constructed from a variety of tissues and organs at different developmental stages and subjected to different abiotic stresses  <cit> . clones ic0aaa40bb02rm <dig>  ic0aaa5be08rm <dig>  and ic0aaa7dc07rm <dig> were sequenced to completion with a primer walk strategy, resulting in  <dig> sequences of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp respectively, that were submitted to genbank . conceptual translation of the cdna sequences showed that clones ic0aaa40bb02rm <dig>  ic0aaa7dc07rm <dig>  and ic0aaa5be08rm <dig> contained orfs coding for proteins of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> aa, respectively, named aco <dig>  aco <dig> and aco <dig> genes, based on their similarity with the arabidopsis ones . an aconitate hydratase gene from citrus limon that was previously reported  was 99% identical to aco <dig> from c. clementina.

a multiple alignment of the arabidopsis and clementine proteins with clustalx exhibited a high degree of conservation between the six proteins, with  <dig> identical residues, and  <dig> conservative changes, representing an overall similarity higher than 85%. analysis of the citrus predicted proteins with pfam  <cit>  showed conservation of the catalytic and the swivel domains  <cit> , suggesting that the citrus proteins are able to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and citrate via a cis-aconitate intermediate .

phylogenetic analysis of the aconitate hydratase family in plants
in order to study the evolutionary history of the aconitate hydratase family in plants, the complete genome sequences of the dicot species populus trichocarpa  <cit> , vitis vinifera  <cit> , carica papaya  <cit> , ricinus communis  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , and glycine max  <cit> ; the monocot species oryza sativa  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , sorghum bicolor  <cit> , and in brachypodium distachyon  <cit> , and the moss physcomitrella patens  <cit>  were searched for aco genes. the blastx search identified  <dig> aco genes in all but  <dig> species, which is in agreement with the results from arabidopsis and citrus. soybean and poplar displayed  <dig> and  <dig> aco genes, respectively, while only  <dig> transcription units were discovered in purple false brome. table  <dig> shows the aco orfs obtained, indicating the species and their accession numbers.

a multiple alignment with  <dig> aco sequences was carried out, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed as described in methods. the tree obtained  shows six main clusters that include all but one aco orfs. as expected, sequences from p. patens group in a single cluster with the largest genetic distances respect to the other sequences, which reflects the evolutionary distance between bryophyta and angiosperm taxa. all the remaining sequences but sbi_02g <dig>  group into  <dig> clusters, that have been named aco <dig>  aco <dig>  aco <dig>  aco <dig>  and aco <dig>  based on the arabidopsis naming system.

sequence sbi_02g <dig> from sorghum, annotated as a member of the aconitate hydratase family in the blast searches, is not included in the previous clusters. genetic distances with respect to the other sequences are also in the same range than the ones obtained for p. patens suggesting that it should not be considered as part of this family.

aco <dig> cluster is composed of sequences from both mono and dicot species, indicating that their ancestor was present in plants previously to the split of mono and dicotyledonous groups. subclusters aco <dig> and aco <dig> only gather genes from dicot species, while aco4-aco <dig> clades are formed only by monocot ones. this fact suggests that these clusters appeared after the monocot and dicot split, and have diverged to give rise to new subfamilies. it is noteworthy that all the dicot species, except poplar and soybean, display  <dig> aco genes, that are distributed into the aco <dig>  aco <dig> and aco <dig> clusters. the organization of the monocot subclusters was found to be similar. analogous evolutionary patterns with sequences from mono and dicot species distributed among mono and polyphyletic clades have been also found for the polygalacturonase  <cit> , lignin biosynthesis  <cit> , or dof  <cit>  gene families.

the aco family in poplar and soybean displays a different organization since both genomes lack aco <dig> homologs, and their genes group in aco <dig> and aco <dig> clusters with very small genetic distances between them, suggesting the occurrence of recent duplication events. in fact, xm_ <dig> and xm_ <dig> are located on homologous genome blocks from chromosomes ii and xiv, produced in a salicoid-specific genome-wide duplication event described in poplar that is still detectable over approximately 92% of the poplar genome  <cit> . the salicoid duplication has been also related to the fact that populus has the largest number of major intrinsic proteins  identified in any single plant species  <cit> , with the duplication of several cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  genes  <cit> , or with the fact that the neutral invertases  gene family has  <dig> members in the arabidopsis genome,  <dig> in rice,  <dig> in vitis, while  <dig> in poplar  <cit> . similarly, the  <dig> aco genes found in soybean might be originated by succeeding whole-genome duplications, one of them legume specific  <dig> mya ago, and by an extraordinary level of gene retention occurred in this species, resulting in 75% of the soybean genes present as multiple copies  <cit> .

in order to find how many of the predicted orfs were transcriptionally active, a blast search against the genbank est database was performed with the species analyzed in the phylogenetic study. for each species, the predicted orfs and the ests producing significant scores were assembled with gap <dig> , which resulted in contigs containing the orf sequences and all the ests associated with each hypothetical gene . considering the large number of analyzed ests in several species , the difference in the number of ests found between the aco genes may reflect the different expression levels of the genes in them.

it is noteworthy that in poplar, with more than  <dig>  ests analyzed, only one predicted gene per cluster, xm_ <dig>  and xm_ <dig> , show significant levels of expression, while their pairs  only show none and  <dig> associated ests. chaudhary et al.  described a similar expression asymmetry in the analysis of the carotenoid biosynthesis genes in rice, arabidopsis and poplar  <cit> . the analysis of the polygalacturonase gene family in arabidopsis and rice also showed that tandem duplicated regions had one relatively highly expressed gene while the rest had either low or no expression levels  <cit> , finally, unequal expression of homologous neutral invertase genes was observed by quantitative rt-pcr in vitis  <cit> . these changes in the level of expression of duplicated genes have been related with neofunctionalization after gene duplications  <cit> .

expression of aconitase genes
to understand the physiological roles of ccaco <dig>  ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig> genes and their involvement in the control of fruit acidity levels, their expression in pulp tissues was determined by real-time rt-pcr along fruit development in selected varieties of mandarins, oranges and lemons. total acidity was also determined in juice extracts to correlate fruit acidity with aconitase gene expression. in mandarins, analyses were performed on two varieties differing in fruit acidity: clemenules  and fortune . three varieties of sweet orange  were also used: an acidless orange  and two normal acidic ones . the two lemon varieties  studied were cv. dulce, that is an acidless lemon and cv. fino that shows normal acidity levels.

in clemenules mandarin, total acidity was low during phase i of fruit development , started to increase at the beginning of phase ii , reached the maximum levels around  <dig> days post anthesis and decreased thereafter during the second half of phase ii and during phase iii . fortune mandarin acidity showed a similar profile, although acid content was significantly higher at the acidity peak  and remained higher during the second half of phase ii and in mature fruit , when acid content was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml in clemenules fruits and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml in fortune fruits. similarly, acidity in comuna and valencia late orange varieties also showed a peak in the middle of phase ii at  <dig> dpa, with acidity levels of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml respectively . total acidity was extremely low in the acidless sucreña orange and acidity at  <dig> dpa was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml. in cultivar fino, a normal acidity lemon, acid content also increased during the second half of phase ii reaching levels much higher than that of mandarin and orange varieties . as above, in acidless dulce lemon, no acidity increase was observed and acid levels remained low and slightly higher than those of sucreña orange .

quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses  allowed transcript detection for ccaco <dig>  ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig> indicating that these sequences correspond to functional aconitase genes. ccaco <dig> was constitutively expressed although at low levels along all phases of fruit development in all citrus varieties used for this study . thus, this expression pattern suggests that ccaco <dig> would not be deeply involved in the acidity reduction process taking place in the cytosol during pulp ripening and that the ccaco <dig> protein might have a mitochondrial localization and therefore be involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle taking place in the mitochondrial matrix. however, cytosolic and mitochondrial compartimentalizations are not mutually exclusive since evidences for the simultaneous localization of plant and yeast aconitase proteins in cytosol and mitochondria have been reported  <cit> .

in general, increase of ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig> gene expression started during the first middle part of phase ii . thus, induction of these genes was coincident or slightly preceded the acidity peak while expression was high at the beginning and during the reduction in acid level. this suggests that ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig> proteins are presumably related to the cytosolic aconitase activity metabolizing the citrate released from the vacuole during ripening  <cit> . interestingly, clemenules fruits did not show ccaco <dig> induction, an observation suggesting a possible mutation in the regulatory regions of this gene, since no alteration was detected in the coding sequence . in spite of the lack of ccaco <dig> induction in clemenules, acidity and ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig> mrna levels in fortune were still higher than those in clemenules. thus, differences in citric acid content between these two varieties may be related to additional regulatory steps such as the activity of the membrane transporters mediating citrate efflux from the vacuole during ripening  <cit> . although the mechanisms controlling citrate vacuolar compartmentalization in citrus are not fully understood, several regulatory points have been proposed for the transport of citrate anions across the tonoplast, including a thermodynamically favoured transport through rectifying anion channels  <cit>  and an active atp-driven transport mechanism  <cit> . in addition, shimada et al  <cit>  isolated a novel citrate-h+ symporter induced during fruit acidity decrease in washington navel. the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the control of vacuolar citrate compartmentalization may thus help to understand the differences in acidity found between these mandarin varieties.

the highest mrna levels of ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig> genes were found in the pulp of acidless sucreña orange and these levels were already high at the onset of phase ii, when the expression of these genes was still arrested in normal acidity oranges  mandarins and lemons. the overexpression of these genes when citric acid is being produced in the mitochondrial matrix, released to the cytosol and exported to the vacuole may be responsible for the acidless phenotype of the variety, since a higher aconitase activity would degrade citric acid, avoiding its vacuolar accumulation.

the comparison of dulce, an acidless lemon variety with fino, a normal acidity lemon, showed no significant differences in the expression of the putative cytosolic aconitase genes. this suggests that different mechanisms are responsible for the phenotypes of orange  and lemon . furthermore, in limes, a derived species from lemon, an explanation involving additional players has been previously proposed for the acidless trait of sweet lime  <cit> . sadka et al.  <cit>  reported that during the initial stages of fruit development a partial inhibition of the enzymatic activity of lemon mitochondrial aconitase allowed the production of high amounts of citric acid in the mitochondria during the initial stages of fruit development. this activity decrease was correlated with a previously reported increase in citramalate, a competitive inhibitor of aconitase activity  <cit>  in acidless sweet lime, citramalate level was lower  <cit> , suggesting that the acidless phenotype of this variety mostly related to citric acid production instead of citric acid removal. this possibility is compatible with the observation that in acidless dulce lemon, expression of the genes involved in citrate removal was normal  and expression of one aconitase gene observed at  <dig> and specially at  <dig> dpa  was slightly increased.

an additional finding of this work is that despite the strong accumulation of citric acid in lemons , ccaco <dig> aconitase mrna levels were similar to those found in oranges and mandarins . this suggests that citric acid in ripening lemon fruit may not be accessible to the aconitase proteins and reinforces the above idea that regulatory differences in the citrus tonoplast transporters may be relevant to understand the diversity of patterns of citric accumulation and homeostasis in the several citrus fruits.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic studies showed the occurrence of five different subfamilies of aconitate hydratase genes in plants that derived from one common ancestor of mono and dicots. the analysis of the sequence of the aconitase family in citrus showed that it is composed of three active genes. the pattern of expression of two of these genes, ccaco <dig> and ccaco <dig>  was normally associated with the timing of citrate reduction in most genotypes including mandarins, oranges and lemons. in addition, two exceptions to this general observation suggest the occurrence of additional regulatory steps of citrate homeostasis in citrus.
