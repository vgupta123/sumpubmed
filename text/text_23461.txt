BACKGROUND
the articulating ends of bones in the diarthrodial joints are covered with a thin layer of articular cartilage . during early development ac functions as a surface growth plate for the underlying bone  <cit> . in adult life, ac functions as a load bearing surface that transmits loads and provides a low friction environment. between birth and skeletal maturity, ac has to accommodate both developmental and load bearing demands.

ac has been shown to develop from a fairly homogeneous tissue to a tissue with site specific composition  <cit>  and site specific mechanical properties  <cit> . it is accepted that this development is affected by mechanical loads  <cit>  that vary over the joint surfaces  <cit> . it is reasonable to assume that mechanical loads also affect the development of the collagen network, and that the differences in mechanical properties in adult life partly reflect differences in collagen network.

it is well known that the composition of the collagen network in ac changes during postnatal development: e.g. collagen type i is replaced by collagen type ii  <cit> , and the amount of collagen increases  <cit> . structural remodelling of the collagen network in terms of the three zones has also been described for postnatal development  <cit> . however, the remodelling capacity of the collagen network in adult ac is limited  <cit> . therefore, differences in collagen structure in adult ac are most likely already present at birth, or developed during postnatal cartilage maturation.

in adults, collagen fibre orientation and organisation are important parameters for the mechanical functions of ac  <cit> . the collagen network partly determines ac stiffness  <cit>  and poisson ratio  <cit>  and in transient loads it also influences interstitial fluid flow  <cit> . across species and anatomical sites, adult ac shows what is known as 'a benninghoff structure'  <cit> . this structure is characterised by three layers in ac: from articular surface to tidemark there is first a thin layer with collagen fibres mainly oriented parallel to the articular surface, second there is a thicker transitional zone where the collagen fibres appear to lack a predominant orientation, and third there is the deep zone where collagen fibres are mainly oriented perpendicular to the tidemark.

recently,  quantitative studies into collagen fibre orientation in stillborn and juvenile animals versus adults have confirmed that the benninghoff structure is absent at birth and that it is developed during early postnatal life  <cit> . van turnhout et al.  <cit>  looked at equine ac in stillborn and mature animals. they found that collagen fibre orientation in the stillborn animals was predominantly parallel to the articular surface throughout the complete cartilage layer. in the adult animals, they confirmed the benninghoff structure. they also noticed that some zonal differentiation was already present in the stillborn ac, although this was not reflected in the depth-dependent collagen orientation. rieppo et al.  <cit>  looked at juvenile and adult porcine ac. for the juvenile animals, they also found that a major part of the collagen fibrils was predominantly oriented parallel to the articular surface throughout the complete cartilage layer. in the adult animals, they confirmed the benninghoff structure. julkunen et al.  <cit>  looked at rabbit ac from age  <dig> weeks to  <dig> months at six time points. their results confirm the findings by van turnhout et al.  <cit>  and rieppo et al.  <cit> .

since the collagen network is an important factor for ac mechanics, these 'remarkable structural alterations during development and growth'  <cit>  in part explain the stiffening of the ac layer during development  <cit> . investigations into how the collagen network affects cartilage mechanics during postnatal development and the mechanical implications of the absence of a benninghoff structure, can be performed with fibril reinforced finite element models, e.g.  <cit> , provided that we have  data on the collagen network at the time points of interest. knowledge on the dynamics of collagen network development is also important for the validation of collagen remodelling algorithms, e.g.  <cit> . and finite element modelling of the time line of collagen structure development in ac will provide insight into the mechanical environment that goes with this development. finally, better insight into the mechanobiology of cartilage development will help to mimic this process in vitro, which is important in the field of cartilage tissue engineering.

last year's studies  <cit>  showed evidence of postnatal collagen network remodelling in ac, but they had their limitations in showing its dynamics. van turnhout et al.  <cit>  used two sample points  and had a limited number of animals. rieppo et al.  <cit>  used three sample points  that did not include perinatal animals. the study by julkunen et al.  <cit>  does contain more and earlier sample points in a time resolved manner. however, perinatal animals were not included in this study and the number of early sample points is still too limited to convincingly show the dynamics of collagen structure remodelling. these authors did show differences in collagen structure development between different joint surfaces .

the objective of the present research is therefore to quantify the development of the collagen network in a model animal from birth to maturity. we further aim to shed more light on the zonal differentiation at birth as noted by van turnhout et al.  <cit> , and to assess differences in  the collagen network between different anatomical sites of a single joint surface. we will look at anatomical sites that are expected to have different loading histories. we use quantitative polarised light microscopy , sometimes called 'the gold standard of histology'  <cit> , to investigate properties of the collagen network and we use the sheep  as our model animal.

for the factor hind leg/fore leg, there is a main effect  and an interaction with age jk, p =  <dig> ). for the main effect, the model predicts that cartilage is  <dig> % ±  <dig> % thicker in the fore legs than in the hind legs. for the interaction with age, cartilage in the fore legs is thicker than the cartilage in the hind legs at all ages but  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks . the interaction with age results in significant differences at  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> weeks .

for the factor lateral site/medial site, there is no main effect , but there is an interaction with age jl, p <  <dig> ). this interaction does not show a trend  and is only significant at age  <dig> weeks .

for the factor caudal site/distal site/rostral site, there is a main effect  and an interaction with age jm, p <  <dig> ). for the main effect, the model predicts that cartilage is  <dig> % ±  <dig> % thicker at the distal site than at the caudal site, and cartilage is  <dig> % ±  <dig> % thicker at the rostral site than at the caudal site. the interaction with age does not show a trend , but there are significant differences at ages  <dig> weeks ,  <dig> weeks ,  <dig> weeks ,  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> weeks .

in the following sections, we present overviews of azimuth and retardance as a function of age. for these figures, cartilage depth as a function of age is estimated from an exponential fit through the data for all samples. this fit is given by   

with df the cartilage depth in μm and t the age in weeks.

collagen orientation
predominant collagen orientation changes with age . predominant collagen orientation is parallel to the articular surface for most of the cartilage depth for the youngest animals. as age increases, predominant collagen orientation in the deep cartilage changes, first at a depth where the future transitional zone will appear for animals of age  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks. at the age of  <dig> weeks, we first see a benninghoff structure: predominant collagen orientation changes from parallel to the articular surface to a predominant orientation more towards the perpendicular with the subchondral bone in the deep cartilage. with increasing age, predominant collagen orientation in the deep cartilage aligns further towards the perpendicular to the cartilage/bone interface. the patterns in figure 3a appear to converge to an azimuth between 120° and 160° near the cartilage/bone interface. thus for the youngest samples, azimuth decreases in the deep zone near the cartilage/bone interface, and in the older samples, azimuth increases in the deep zone near the cartilage/bone interface. figure 3b shows an overview of the dynamics of the azimuth results for all samples  per age taken together . the final model for the covariate orientation index  with logit-link and binomial variance function on the logit scale is:   

the results are gathered in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  there is a main affect of age on the orientation index  . as expected,  is close to  <dig> for the youngest animals and decreases with age , as less collagen fibres are predominantly oriented parallel to the articular surface. at  <dig> weeks,  is  <dig>  lower than at  <dig> weeks. after  <dig> weeks, no significant differences between successive age groups occur, although  at  <dig> weeks  does differ significantly from  at  <dig> weeks .

results for the statistical model for orientation index  with logit-link and binomial variance function. letters for the fixed terms represent: aj - age, bk - fore/hind, cl - lateral/medial and dm - caudal/distal/rostral. combinations represent interactions between these factors.

there is a main effect for lateral sites versus medial sites . the model shows that  is  <dig>  higher at the lateral site. inspection of the average orientation patterns for these sites per age  indicates two differences: 1) the medial site appears to be further in the development of the benninghoff structure at ages  <dig> weeks,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks; and 2) the depth where the predominant collagen fibre orientation is halfway in the transition from superficial zone to deep zone, is smaller for the medial site than for the lateral site at ages  <dig> weeks,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks. both effects result in a lower value of .

for the factor caudal site/distal site/rostral site, there is a main effect  and an interaction with age jm, p =  <dig> ). for the main effect, the model predicts that  is  <dig>  higher at the distal site than at the caudal site, and  is  <dig>  higher at the rostral site than at the caudal site. the interaction with age shows significant differences between  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks .  is higher at the rostral site than at the caudal site at  <dig> weeks ,  <dig> weeks ,  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> weeks .  is higher at the distal site than at the caudal site at  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> weeks . inspection of the average orientation patterns for these sites per age  shows that the caudal site develops its benninghoff structure earlier in life than the rostral and distal site: predominant collagen orientation at a depth of  <dig> μm at  <dig> weeks is 104° at the caudal site against 127° at the rostral site and 125° at the distal site. the average orientation patterns do not show a trend for differences between development for the rostral site and distal site. at  <dig> weeks of age, all site-dependent variation in collagen orientation has vanished .

retardance
the retardance values change during development, but the general retardance patterns appear indifferent to age . for all ages from articular surface towards the bone, retardance first has a maximum near the articular surface, followed by a minimum at a depth of ≈  <dig> μm that is in turn followed by another maximum deeper in the cartilage . figure 5b shows an overview of the dynamics of the retardance results for all samples  per age taken together . the position of the retardance minimum is marked with a dashed white line.

the final model for the maximum retardance near the articular surface Δmax with log-link and gamma variance function on the log scale is:   

the results are gathered in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  there is a main effect of age with the maximum retardance near the articular surface Δmax . Δmax increases with age until  <dig> weeks when it is 164% ±  <dig> % higher than at  <dig> weeks . no significant changes occur after  <dig> weeks: at  <dig> weeks, Δmax is 154% ±  <dig> % higher than at  <dig> weeks,

results for the statistical model for the maximum retardance near the articular surface Δmax with log-link and gamma variance function. letters for the fixed terms represent: aj - age, bk - fore/hind, cl - lateral/medial and dm - caudal/distal/rostral. combinations represent interactions between these factors.

there are no other main effects, but there are two significant interactions with the factor caudal site/distal site/rostral site jm, p =  <dig>  and km, p =  <dig> ). the interaction with age jm shows significant differences at ages  <dig> weeks ,  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> weeks , but no trend . the interaction of caudal site/distal site/rostral site with hind legs/fore legs is due to the caudal site: Δmax is  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, higher in the hind legs than in the fore legs for the caudal site. the model shows no differences between hind legs and fore legs for the rostral and distal site.

the final model for the position of the retardance minimum near the articular surface d|Δmin with log-link and gamma variance function on the log scale is the same as for the orientation index . there is a main effect of the factor age on d|Δmin . with increasing age, d| Δmin first increases until  <dig> weeks and next deceases until  <dig> weeks of age . at the maximum at  <dig> weeks, d| Δmin is  <dig> % ±  <dig> % higher than at  <dig> weeks. at  <dig> weeks of age an older, the model shows no difference for d|Δmin with  <dig> weeks of age.

discussion
the results on cartilage thickness are mostly in line with previous work. brommer et al.  <cit>  for instance, analysed site-dependent development of cartilage thickness in the equine proximal phalanx. as we did in our study, they found that cartilage thickness decreases during development, and they found no site-dependent differences in cartilage thickness in mature animals. in our study, cartilage at the caudal site is thinner than at the rostral and distal site and cartilage in the fore legs is thicker than in the hind legs, although the differences are small . cartilage thickness has been shown to respond to mechanical loads during development  <cit>  and the results for the development of the collagen network suggest influences of different loading regimes at different anatomical sites. however, cartilage thickness in the mature animal is thought to relate to joint congruency, i.e. the similarity of the two articulating cartilage surfaces  <cit> . this explains why we find only small site-dependent differences in cartilage thickness in the nearly congruent joint that we investigated. this leaves us with the difference in cartilage thickness between hind legs and fore legs. contrary to the remark by simon  <cit>  that cartilage is in general thicker in the hind limbs, we find that cartilage is thicker in the fore limbs, and that the difference increases slightly between birth and maturity.

as in previous studies on collagen structure in horses  <cit> , pigs  <cit>  and rabbits  <cit> , we find that the perinatal predominant collagen fibre orientation is parallel to the articular surface throughout most of the cartilage depth and that this arrangement changes to an arcade-like benninghoff structure as the cartilage matures. we also confirmed the presence of a retardance minimum in the perinatal animals as noted earlier by van turnhout et al.  <cit> . the collagen remodelling process appears finished at  <dig> weeks of age in our sheep in this joint : the differences in qplm results are small after this age and three of the four measured parameters  do not change significantly between  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks of age. hunziker et al.  <cit>  found no noteworthy changes after puberty in the structural organization of rabbit ac and  <dig> weeks is also approximately when the sheep are sexually mature: the first ovulation or puberty in the sheep occurs at ≈  <dig> months of age or at a mass of  <dig> kg to  <dig> kg, and this transition lasts ≈  <dig> weeks  <cit> . it is well before skeletal maturity, which occurs around  <dig> months of age  <cit> . also, the slaughter mass results  show that the animals still developed after the age of  <dig> weeks.

the fact that collagen orientation appears to vary in the deep zone  is related to our decision to average sample profiles up to the mean depth of the sample pool. there are samples that are shorter than this mean depth and the number of samples that we  use to average therefore decreases from the minimum depth in the sample pool to the mean depth. the benefit of this procedure is that it better captures the superficial and transitional zones: e.g., the observation that the absolute depth of the retardance minimum appears invariant to age is evident when analysed in this manner. the downside is that from the minimum depth to the mean depth in the sample pool, we have an increasing proportion of data that is very close to the cartilage/bone interface. the azimuth data in particular may deviate from the deep zone data at the cartilage/bone interface, where the collagen ensures the integration of these two tissues. inspection of the individual orientation patterns has shown that the azimuth is in fact fairly constant in the deep zone , and that the deviations towards the cartilage/bone interface in figure 3a are largely due to the increasing influence of cartilage/bone interfaces as described above. we find site dependent differences in collagen network remodelling . both  and d|Δmin are higher at the lateral site than at the medial site .  is higher for less advanced benninghoff structures and for benninghoff structures with higher d|Δmin. the results for d|Δmin suggest that its smaller value for the medial sites is correlated to the smaller values of . thus, the transitional zone is at a larger depth at the lateral side, i.e. the superficial zone is thicker at the lateral side.

also, the caudal site develops different from the distal and rostral sites: it develops its benninghoff structure earlier in life  and maximum retardance is higher in the hind legs for the caudal site, but not for the distal and rostral site km, p =  <dig> ). these observations suggests a loading regime during development that is different for the caudal sites compared to the rostral and distal sites. in the last sample point however, we find no site dependent differences in predominant collagen orientation patterns  or the orientation index  . gründer  <cit>  reports a faster structural development for sheep tibial ac compared to femural ac, julkunen et al.  <cit>  showed that collagen structure development and adult collagen structure both differ between femur and tibia in rabbits, and brama et al.  <cit>  showed changes in collagen structure in juvenile foals as a result of exercise training. however, egger et al.  <cit>  did not find differences in collagen structure in adult elephant knee cartilage and they propose that this is due to the congruency in the elephant knee. this hypothesis is supported by our data: in the examined nearly congruent joint that was subjected to physiological loads, we also find no differences in collagen orientation between sites on the same cartilage surface for the oldest  animals.

our data shows that the predominant collagen orientation first changes at a depth that marks the proximal boundary of the transitional zone in the mature animal . the resulting intermediate pattern for predominant collagen orientation that we find at  <dig> weeks, is similar to the intermediate pattern found in a  <dig>  month year old horse  <cit> , in  <dig> month old pigs  <cit> , and in rabbits of  <dig> weeks to  <dig> weeks  <cit> . this intermediate pattern is present for all anatomical sites in the current study. this suggests that the depth-dependent pattern of collagen remodelling is similar across species, joints and anatomical sites, except for the timing . the difference in species  and anatomical location  can explain why rieppo et al.  <cit>  found that collagen remodelling was not finished when their pigs reached sexual maturity.

the absence of a benninghoff collagen structure at birth may have implications for postnatal morphogenesis. results of simulations with finite element models  <cit>  and in vitro experimental results  <cit>  show correlations between hydrostatic pressure and inhibition of ossification and between shear strains and promotion of ossification. an effect of the benninghoff collagen structure is that it limits cartilage swelling, and it thereby effectively increases the hydrostatic  pressure in the deep zone  <cit> . the development of the benninghoff structure might thus serve to prevent ossification and maintain a functional cartilage layer in the adult animal. it would be interesting to see if cartilage ossification is promoted when the benninghoff collagen structure cannot develop.

the retardance minimum near the articular surface is traditionally associated with the transitional zone, a layer with a weak anisotropic collagen arrangement, in adult animals  <cit> . our special interest in this retardance minimum appears to have been justified. not only is it present at birth without evidence of differentiation in collagen orientation, which is confirmed by earlier work on equine  <cit>  and porcine cartilage  <cit> , it is also the only parameter that is similar in the youngest and oldest animals . during cartilage maturation, its thickness decreases to about one third of the perinatal thickness; collagen fibre orientation changes from a network predominantly parallel to the articular surface over the cartilage depth to a benninghoff structure; and maximum retardance increases to about twice that of neonatal cartilage. compared to these developmental changes, the depth of the retardance minimum  appears relatively indifferent to the remodelling process . thus, a layer with a weak anisotropic collagen arrangement, or less collagen, or both, is already formed before birth. this can for instance be a result of in utero movement and muscular loads on the joint  <cit> . if so, then apparently the mechanical state in this layer does not change enough after birth to result in a much stronger anisotropic collagen fibre arrangement. if in utero joint loading is responsible for the emergence of this layer, we would predict its absence in animal models that e.g. lack skeletal muscle activity  <cit> . finite element models may help to explain what is so special about this layer, and its location.

with this paper, we provide essential information for analysis of the role of the collagen fibre network during development, e.g. by fibril reinforced finite element models  <cit> . it is the first time that the dynamics of post natal remodelling of collagen fibre organisation have been time and space resolved from birth to maturity. therefore, we were able to present the first solid observation of a retardance minimum in perinatal animals, more or less at a fixed distance  from the articular surface. this is an important step towards a better understanding of the mechanobiology of articular cartilage development. with additional information on collagen densities during development, we will be able to interpret the retardance minimum as a region with less collagen or a region with more anisotropic collagen and see how much this interpretation changes during development. with additional information on the development of glycosaminoglycan concentrations and fixed charge densities in the ac, it becomes possible to estimate the mechanical environment that drives the depth-dependent ac development in general, and depth-dependent collagen orientation remodelling in particular.

CONCLUSIONS
the collagen network in articular cartilage remodels between birth and sexual maturity from a network with predominant orientation parallel to the articular surface to a benninghoff network. changes in predominant collagen orientation occur first at a depth that marks the proximal boundary of the transitional zone in adult animals. this is the first solid observation of the dynamics of collagen structure remodelling, and provides important information for the further investigation of articular cartilage mechanobiology.

the fact that the retardance minimum near the articular surface is present at all ages shows that a zonal differentiation is already present in the perinatal animals. however, the zonal differentiation can not be correlated to changes in collagen network orientation in these animals. furthermore, we were able to show that the depth of this retardance minimum is fairly constant during development. without information on the development of collagen densities, we cannot tell if this retardance minimum is the result of a region with less collagen or a region with collagen with less anisotropic predominant orientations; and we cannot tell whether the relative contributions  change during development. we intent to address this in a future publication.

we observe differences in the dynamics of collagen remodelling between different anatomical sites, but in the adult animals we see no difference in collagen structure  or cartilage thickness. we expect that this is due to the congruency of the joint that we investigated. comparison of the data in the current paper with other data on collagen remodelling in literature, suggests that the general pattern of collagen remodelling  is similar between joints and species.
