BACKGROUND
bovine placental lactogen  and bovine prolactin-related protein  <dig>  are members of the growth hormone /prolactin  family  <cit> . the homology between bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> is 62% for nucleotides and 36% for amino acids  <cit> . bovine pl is classified as a classical member of the gh/prl gene family  <cit> . in contrast, thirteen isoforms of bprp have been identified and are categorized as nonclassical members of this family  <cit> . bcsh <dig> has been detected in various mammalian species including humans  <cit> , while orthologues of prp <dig> have been detected in several animals   <cit> . in the ruminant placenta, bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> are concurrently detected in trophoblastic binucleate cells   <cit> . the expression of both transcripts becomes apparent in bnc from about day  <dig> of gestation. coincidentally, the earliest detection of the transcripts parallels the appearance of bnc in the fetal trophoblast, and studies indicate that bcsh <dig> is a reliable marker of bnc morphogenesis  <cit> . however, the temporal profile of these two genes are disparate during gestation such that the expression level of bcsh <dig> increases with the progression of pregnancy; whereas, the bprp <dig> expression pattern is biphasic with a gradual increase up to mid-gestation followed by a period of steady decline  <cit> . despite advances in the unraveling of gh/prl gene sequences, structural characteristics, expression sites, and cell localization, little is known about their molecular regulatory mechanisms in bovines. recent studies have revealed the transcriptional regulatory factors of the pl-family in other species; for example, sp <dig> has been identified as an important factor for the expression of human pl; mouse pl-i has been shown to be activated by activator protein  - <dig>  gata <dig>  and gata3; rat pl-ii is reported to have binding sites for ets and ap-1; and ovine pl is documented to be activated by ap- <dig> and gata  <cit> . however, there is limited information on the factors that regulate the expression of the prp gene, particularly in the artiodactyl species  <cit> . recently, we reported that the ap- <dig> family may be involved in the regulation of these genes in bovine species  <cit> , although additional studies are necessary to confirm this finding. however, a growing body of evidence suggests that mechanisms involving epigenetic changes regulate the expression of some genes  <cit> . epigenetic modification involving dna methylation has been demonstrated to be central to tissue-dependent gene expression, embryogenesis, and carcinogenesis  <cit> . we hypothesized that the differential expression patterns of bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> are controlled by dna methylation, and in this study we investigated whether dna methylation regulates the expression of the bcsh <dig> and bprp1genes in trophoblast cells.

RESULTS
the effects of 5-aza-dc on bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> expression in cultured cells
the bcsh <dig> expression was moderately induced in 5-aza-dc-supplemented fibroblast cultures ; whereas, there was an increase in the overall expression intensity in bt- <dig> 5-aza-dc treated cultures  . in contrast to bcsh <dig>  bprp <dig> expression was decreased in bt- <dig> cells, but no bprp <dig> expression was detected in fibroblasts .

determination of cpg sites in the 5'-flanking region of bcsh <dig> and bprp1
the cpg sites in the 5'-flanking region of bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> were examined using day  <dig> cot. in all,  <dig> cpg sites were detected in bcsh <dig>  from - <dig> to the transcription starting site, as is shown in figure 2a. bprp <dig> had  <dig> cpg sites from - <dig> to the transcription starting site, as is shown in figure 3a.

the dna methylation statuses of cotyledon and fetal skin
using samples from day  <dig> cot and fetal skin , the dna methylation status of the 5'-flanking region of the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes was examined using bisulfate sequencing.

bcsh1
we divided the 5'-flanking region of bcsh <dig> into  <dig> regions  depending on the distribution of the cpg sites. dna was hypomethylated in the cot but not in the skin samples. in all,  <dig> cpg sites  showed a significantly low methylation status . seven of these  <dig> cpg sites were assumed to be located between regions  <dig> and  <dig> .

bprp1
we divided the 5'-flanking region of bprp <dig> into  <dig> regions . the dna methylation status was similar between the cot and skin samples. only  <dig> cpg sites  in region  <dig> had a significantly low-level of methylation  .

dynamic changes in the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> gene methylation levels in cotyledonary tissue during gestation
bcsh1
we selected  <dig> cpg sites in regions  <dig> and  <dig> to compare their methylation status during gestation  based on our findings of the cpg sites that exhibited significantly low methylation levels in the day  <dig> cot samples, as shown in figure  <dig> 

on day  <dig> of gestation, the methylation ratios at two cpg sites  were lower  in comparison to the other sites . these lower ratios were maintained at the above loci throughout gestation. however, no results were significantly different .

bprp1
we examined a total of  <dig> cpg sites in regions  <dig> and  <dig> during gestation . on day  <dig> of gestation,  <dig> out of the  <dig> sites showed a relatively low methylation ratio . in particular, two cpg sites  showed extremely low methylation ratios, and the observed ratio was maintained up to day  <dig> of gestation at these sites. the methylation levels increased at sites - <dig> and - <dig> by day  <dig>  and the hypermethylation status was maintained up to day  <dig> at these sites. the methylation ratios at sites - <dig> and - <dig> decreased to half the values observed on day  <dig>  one specific site, - <dig>  exhibited a very low methylation ratio  on day  <dig> of gestation . a steady pattern of hypomethylation was observed at cpg sites - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> throughout gestation.

the dna methylation status of bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> in bt-1
bcsh1
seven cpg sites in bcsh <dig> regions  <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed by sodium bisulfate sequencing using bt- <dig> genomic dna. a lower  methylation ratio was found at the - <dig> site in bt- <dig> cells compared to the levels detected in bovine fibroblast cells .

bprp1
nine cpg sites in bprp <dig> regions  <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed by sodium bisulfate sequencing using bt- <dig> genomic dna. seven of the  <dig> cpg sites were hypermethylated in the bt- <dig> cells , and six out of the  <dig> sites were hypermethylated in the fibroblasts. the - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> sites showed a higher  methylation ratio in the bt- <dig> cells than in the fibroblasts. whereas, the methylation rate at the cpg - <dig> site was lower  in the bt- <dig> cells .

the transcriptional activity in the 5'-flanking region of the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes
bcsh1
the - <dig> bcsh <dig> luc construct had the highest transcriptional activity in the bt- <dig>  cells. the - <dig> and - <dig> luc constructs had  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher activity relative to the no-promoter controls, respectively. a reduction in promoter activity was noted for the methylated - <dig>  and - <dig> constructs in the bt- <dig> cells. the transcriptional activity of these constructs in fibroblasts was comparable: the - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> constructs showed  <dig>  ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold activity, respectively. in contrast, methylation of the - <dig>  and - <dig> constructs dramatically reduced the promoter activity  in the fibroblasts.

bprp1
the first two fragments of the 5'-flanking region  demonstrated no transcriptional activity, in bt- <dig> or fibroblast cells. the highest activity in the bt- <dig> cells was found with the - <dig> luc construct , and increased activity was also found in the - <dig>  and - <dig>  constructs. whereas, in the fibroblasts, only the - <dig> construct had a higher transcriptional activity than the control. three methylated constructs from - <dig> to - <dig> displayed repressed transcription in both cell populations  .

discussion
cell to cell interactions are crucial to the development of the placenta and the exchange of stage-specific molecular signals between the fetal and maternal units  <cit> . specifically, these interactions are paramount to programmed fetal growth, maternal adaptation to pregnancy, and coordination of parturition. trophoblast-specific bnc is a source of an array of biochemical products including bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig>  <cit> . the expression profiles of bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> are dynamically distinct during gestation, which suggests an intrinsic regulatory role in placental formation and fetal growth in cattle  <cit> . although, bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> stem from the same bnc, the mechanism by which endogenous mediators regulate the transcription and translation of these transcripts remains to be established  <cit> . the stage-specific differential gene expression may be directly or indirectly regulated by transcription factors  <cit> ; however, recent studies have established that epigenetic regulation, particularly dna methylation, is an important mode of control  <cit> . here, we show evidence of epigenetic regulation of the bcsh <dig> transcript in bovine trophoblasts.

treatment of bovine fibroblasts with 5-aza-dc induced an increase in the level of bcsh <dig> expression in parallel with a decrease in the expression of bprp <dig>  ectopic expression of bcsh <dig> in endometrial fibroblasts and subsequent sequence analysis following 5-aza-dc supplementation provided proof of the concept as well as the practicality of the technique, as has been described for other genes  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of bcsh <dig> was restricted to bnc and could not be induced in fibroblasts, including cot fibroblasts , implying that the source of the cells as well as the cell microenvironment influences mrna expression. additionally, the impact of the length and position of methylation zones may be unique for each gene, and the influence of 5-aza-dc may be quenched depending on the cell/gene milieu. in contrast, compelling evidence obtained over the past decade has demonstrated that histone acetylation is linked to transcriptional activation  <cit> . studies involving the nanog gene, which is a key factor in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells, revealed that its expression is not affected by 5-aza-dc; however, a combination treatment including trichostatin a facilitated expression  <cit> . this indicates that gene transcription is intricately regulated by a functional link between dna methylation and histone acetylation. in this study, we did not examine the biological role of histone acetylation in relation to bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> regulation, and this remains to be clarified. although the precise regulation of bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> remains obscure, our study provides the first evidence of a methylation-based regulatory mechanism for bovine pl-related transcripts.

we envisioned that a number of cpg islands in the 5'-flanking region of bcsh <dig> will be hypomethylated in the cot, taking into account that the bcsh <dig> gene is a trophoblast-specific transcript  <cit> . on the other hand, we predicted that the majority of cpg sites associated with bcsh <dig> in somatic cells, such as skin will likely be hypermethylated. the bisulfite sequencing confirmed the above notion, particularly, the results from the day  <dig> samples . we further demonstrated that the methylation status of bprp <dig> is distinct from that of bcsh <dig>  generally, the methylation pattern of both genes mirrored their expression profiles throughout gestation, particularly at the - <dig> site of bprp <dig>  however, it remains to be elucidated whether the changes observed in the methylation levels of both genes are to some extent dependant on the proportion of somatic versus trophoblast cells in placentomes throughout the various stages of gestation. hence, it is important to delineate the stage-specific regulatory role of methylation patterns in relation to cell populations to facilitate interpretations of the activation/suppression of trophoblast-specific transcripts. on the other hand, we only detected three cpg sites of bprp <dig> that were significantly different between the cot and skin samples at day  <dig> . the biological significance of the variation in the methylation levels observed between the fibroblast cells and skin at day  <dig> is not clear. however, these differences could be attributable to their divergent expression patterns during gestation  <cit> . additionally, the evidence from in-vitro cultures of hela cells indicates that the dna methylation pattern undulates during the cell cycle of a mature somatic cell  <cit> . therefore, the likelihood of some dynamic alterations in global methylation levels with progressive subcultures of fibroblasts needs verification.

during gestation, bcsh <dig> expression continuously increases with the progression of gestation, while bprp <dig> also increases up to mid-gestation followed by a steady decline  <cit> . the question is what controls this disparate pattern of expression of these co-expressed molecules. accordingly, we first confirmed the transcriptional activities of both genes and detected no marked difference in bcsh <dig> activation between the bt- <dig> cells and bovine fibroblast cells. similarly, unmethylated bprp <dig> constructs retained activity in both cell lines. notably, the levels of bprp <dig> transcriptional activity for the individual constructs were different between the fibroblasts and bt- <dig> cells. also, the unmethylated bprp <dig> constructs had lower transcriptional activity, while the methylated constructs augmented suppression. although these results indicate that the expression of both genes is affected by their methylation status, other factors may be participating in their regulation, such as, histone acetylation or ubiquitination and/or transcription factors  <cit> . in this study, the efficiency of the transfection constructs in bt- <dig> cells was lower than that in the fibroblast cells . so the efficiency of transfection may be affected by the intensity of luciferase activity, and more effective transfection methods need to be developed for precise analysis of luciferase activity. the dna sequences of the 5'-flanking region in bovine and ovine csh <dig> are highly conserved, and the binding site of ap- <dig> was detected in bcsh <dig> as a consensus cis-element that is similar to the cis-element  that has been recognized in ocsh <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, sp <dig>  and gata  consensus binding sites exist within the - <dig> region, which was confirmed by genetyx ver. <dig> . these binding sites might interact with ap- <dig>  as these transcriptional factors are documented to regulate some placental specific genes  <cit> . to date, there are no reports concerning the interplay between transcriptional factors and bprp <dig>  but ap- <dig> may be a regulatory factor since its expression profile in bovine placenta parallels that of bprp <dig>  <cit> . ushizawa et al.  <cit>  reported two ap- <dig> consensus binding sites in the upstream region within - <dig> , but surprisingly in this study, the constructs containing these two sites showed no transcriptional activity in either the bt- <dig> or fibroblast cells. therefore, the role of the above sites in transcription regulation needs further elucidation  <cit> . in the present study, we detected a new ap- <dig> consensus binding site  using genetyx ver. <dig>  and the constructs containing these sites, - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  exhibited high bprp1transcriptional activity in bt- <dig> cells. therefore, it is plausible that ap- <dig> is involved in the transcriptional regulation of bprp <dig>  additionally, sp <dig>  and gata  consensus binding sites were also detected in the upstream region of bprp <dig> by genetyx ver. <dig> analysis. this likely denotes combinatorial regulation of the transcriptional activation and/or suppression of bprp <dig> 

in summary, our findings demonstrate that dna methylation may regulate dynamic changes in gene expression during bnc morphogenesis, placental formation, and trophoblast differentiation in bovine species. however, further studies are necessary to understand the precise transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of bcsh <dig> and bprp to comprehend their role in placentogenesis, fetogenesis, maternal recognition and adjustment to pregnancy, and coordination of parturition. this may also provide an insight into the roles of the various homologous and orthologous members of the gh/prl family that are detected in the placenta.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicates for the first time that there are different regulatory mechanisms for the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes and demonstrates that bcshi may be subject to transcriptional regulation by dna methylation. these data unravel the novel kinetics of the induction of the synchronously expressed bnc-specific bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> transcripts, which may aid the understanding of the intricate regulation and the specific role of these important molecules in bovine placentogenesis and the progression of pregnancy.
