BACKGROUND
grape  is the most widely grown fruit crop globally. the area under grape cultivation is approximately  <dig>  million hectares with a production of about  <dig>  million tons. the berries are categorized mainly into table grapes  and wine grapes , as well as for several value-added products  <cit> . china is the leading grape-producing country, accounting for 14% of the global grape production  <cit> .

there are several developmental and metabolic processes that occur in the buds and twigs of grape plants during the winter period. these processes include enzyme synthesis, respiration, cell division, photosynthesis, growth stimulator production and growth inhibitor down-regulation. dormancy is a controlling mechanism that enables woody perennials to adapt seasonal environmental changes and thus affects the following season’s vegetative growth and fruit production. currently, global warming has a substantial influence on winter chilling accumulation and dormancy release of fruit trees  <cit> . to ensure sustainable fruit production, it is necessary to investigate the underlying genetic factors responsible for controlling dormancy  <cit> . extended dormancy is a key hindrance for the large scale fruit production, including grape, in warm or mild winter regions under temperate and subtropical climates  <cit> . several studies have been conducted to determine the association between natural and chemical-induced ed, analyze gene expression during long and short photoperiods, and identify the transcript profile of bud development and signaling of bud dormancy break in grape . dormancy is generally classified into three main types: paradormancy , endodormancy , and ecodormancy   <cit> . pd is the plant growth suspension initiated by factors outside the meristem. it is essentially the effect of one organ on another and involves the dominance of apical buds. ed is regulated by internal growth inhibitors, even under favorable conditions; without exposure to cold temperature for a specific duration , endodormant buds  cannot initiate growth. exposure to low temperature  shifts the ed state of the plant to ecd. ecdbs can break and grow when exposed to suitable growth conditions  <cit> . when edb’s chilling requirement are fulfilled, the ed is released. edbs steadily transition to the ecd state, especially under adverse environmental conditions. summer buds , which are green in color and small in size and grow on one side of winter buds that have no scales, can be observed after dormancy release during the new growth period and remain active for a short time during the transition from dormancy release to early summer dormancy. like other perennial deciduous fruit plants, grape undergoes a characteristic dormant period during its growth cycle. in southeast china, grape buds fulfill their chilling requirement in the end of february and blossom in following spring. inadequate cold accumulation hours during this period lead to irregular flowering, which consequently decreases fruit production.

the investigations have been made on dormancy at physiological as well as molecular levels in different deciduous fruits. mads-box  genes associated with dormancy-have been isolated to investigate their expression pattern in some fruit plants during dormancy  <cit> . for example, dam <dig> through dam <dig> have been identified in peach and japanese apricot  <cit> , while mads13- <dig>  mads13- <dig>  mads13- <dig>  ppmads <dig> and ppmads <dig> were found in japanese pear and chinese white pear   <cit> . the expression profile of these genes during the induction and release of endodormancy indicated that dams serve as dose-dependent inhibitors of bud break  <cit> . additionally, several other genes are involved in the complex molecular network regulating dormancy in deciduous plants. therefore, segregating single gene is not sufficient for illuminating underlying molecular processed associated with bud dormancy  <cit> .

recently, the next-generation sequencing  technology has uplifted the transcriptomic by allowing the rna-sequencing using cdna libraries on a large scale. rna-seq is a highly efficient and modern tool that involves deep sequencing technologies to generate millions of short cdna reads which is considerably more efficient than microarray analysis  <cit> . in previous studies, rna-seq was successfully applied to investigate dormancy based on direct sequencing of cdnas in several woody plants using 454-pyrosequencing technology  <cit> . moreover, in another study the transcriptomic analysis revealed the dormancy-related regulatory pathways involving photoperiod, hormones and circadian clocks . although previous studies have investigated the physiological as well as the molecular mechanism of bud dormancy using the transcriptomic approach in deciduous fruits as well as other crops  <cit> , no attempt has yet been made to study grape bud dormancy at the transcriptomic level.

this study was undertaken to investigate underlying molecular processes regulating bud dormancy in grape and to develop robust foundation for molecular research. rna-seq technology was used to categorize and characterize the expression profile of differentially expressed genes  during three different grape bud dormancy stages. this novel transcriptome and transcript expression profiling data generated through rna-seq will offer an improved understanding of underlying molecular process of bud dormancy and will pave the way to identifying key genes involved in dormancy for the ultimate improvement of table grape industry.

discussion
grape, being one of the most important fruit crops, is globally consumed fresh as well as in the form of several value-added products  <cit> . dormancy is a very complex and highly programmed mechanism used by perennial plants to cope with unfavorable environmental conditions. the beginning of dormancy requires sensing and development of regular environmental signals  <cit> . in grape, a shorter photoperiod and low temperatures cause the alteration of buds into ed  <cit> . dormancy can be generally categorized into three dormant states, ed , ed  and ecd   <cit> . the molecular and physiological aspects of bud dormancy in grape have been previously examined in several studies . this is first ever report on application of rna-seq technique to classify a large number of transcripts from grape buds of different dormancy stages. using a transcriptomic approach, we observed that the number and expression profiles of degs differed during dormancy stages. a sum of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed in the pd vs ed, sb vs ed and sb vs pd comparisons, respectively. transcripts with a like expression patterns might be functionally correlated during bud dormancy. a cluster analysis of degs during three comparative dormancy stages was carried out to know the expression pattern of the  <dig>  transcripts that were differentially expressed during dormancy stages. the cluster analysis revealed that the most of transcripts were up-regulated while a relatively smaller number of transcripts were down-regulated. our findings revealed that a number of degs were highly expressed in sb vs ed than in the other two stages of dormancy. previous studies showed that gene activity in black current was minimum at early stages of dormancy and maximum at the moment of bud break  <cit> . in our study, very high transcript activity in sb vs ed as well as very low activity in sb vs pd was likely due to growth-conducive conditions or signaling from other plants. additionally, using kegg analysis, we found that these degs belonged to several pathways. substantial variations were noticed in five pathways, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, ribosome, starch and sucrose metabolism in pd vs ed and sb vs ed stages, while secondary metabolites biosynthesis, signaling of plant hormone and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were represented in sb vs pd stage of dormancy. our findings were in consensus with previous work on chinese pear, in which comparison of transcriptomic analysis between ed and ecd during the whole dormancy cycle showed substantial variations in five kegg pathways, plant-pathogen interaction, metabolism of ether lipid, ribosome, endocytosis in glycerophospholipid and metabolic pathways  <cit> . enriched go terms recognized in our study, oxidation-reduction process, hormone metabolism and jasmonic acid stimulus, were also in agreement with previous reports  <cit> .

oxidative stress is proposed to be an important process involved in ed release  <cit> . consistent with this perspective, h2o <dig> has been reported to be a signaling factor increasing the expression of genes related with release of ed  <cit> . an increase in h2o <dig> levels take place earlier to release ed in grape buds, proposed that h2o <dig> could be a signal molecule that triggers gene expression for release of ed. recent researches have figured out the key role of hydrogen cynamide and calcium signaling in bud break of perlette grapevines  <cit> . the higher expression of calcium signaling-related genes corresponds with the optimum bud break potentiation in v. riparia, additionally proposing a key role for calcium in the transition from ed to ecd  <cit> . a significantly down-regulated group of  <dig> genes was identified during the alteration from ed to ecd at chilling accumulation time in grape and in leafy spurge, and included proline-rich protein, glutathione s-transferase, peroxidase,, serine decarboxylase, thaumatin, serine carboxy peptidase and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase  <cit> . our data demonstrated the up-regulated expression of catalase along with down-regulated expression of some peroxidase genes among all three dormancy stages. down-regulation of peroxidase genes and up-regulation of catalase genes could enhance or decrease the h2o <dig>  thus increase release of ed. therefore, further investigation into the relationship between activity of catalase and levels of h2o <dig> after ed is required. generally, metabolic networks are controlled by hormone function and signaling. the involvement of aba to maintain and promote bud dormancy in woody plants has been projected . a gradual decreas of aba contents during ed to ecd have been reported in leafy spurge and pear buds previously  <cit>  and peaked in poplar after few weeks of short days  <cit> . moreover, an aba related transcript has showed down-regulation during the chilling phase essential for ed release in grape  <cit> . similar to these findings, our study showed higher aba expression in the pd vs ed comparison, while lower expression was observed in the sb vs ed comparison. based on previous reports, we speculate that aba might play acrucial role in initiation and maintenance of ed in grape.

gibberellin  are plant hormones that control several growth processes including seed germination; stem elongation, growth regulation and dormancy. previous reports have depicted the involvement of ga in bud break, and an increase in ga levels has been considered to be essential for ed release  <cit> . ga signaling via gid <dig> receptors is essential for seed germination in arabidopsis  <cit> . five transcripts in the gid <dig> and della families were identified and validated by qrt-pcr in the present study. these transcripts also showed different expression patterns during the three dormancy stages. gid <dig> family transcripts were up-regulated while della family transcripts were down-regulated during the three dormancy stages. overall, these results suggested that ga was not associated with release of ed activities, with the exception of bud burst initiation.

basipetally transported auxin is considered as a key signal regulating pd. cytokinin synthesis is inhibited by auxin. several genes have been identified in arabidopsis and pea which involved in auxin-regulated growth inhibition  <cit> . cytokinin and auxin signaling have been identified in regulation of pd; however, their involvements in ed are not yet clear  <cit> . the auxin and cytokinin-responsive transcripts are differentially expressed as plants alteration from pd to ed  <cit> . in our study, transcripts related to signaling pathways of cytokinin and auxin showed lower expression in all three stages of dormancy. based on previous studies, we speculate that auxin and cytokinin might be associated in pd and ed regulation of grape buds.

the functional category of identified transcription factors was significantly enriched in the transcript expression profile of this comparative study. among these identified transcription factors, within the ap2-like transcription factor family, erf subfamily with two transcripts was significantly enriched  <cit> , while many of them can regulate the ethylene responses during dormancy and similar responses of erf-like transcription factor have also been reported in poplar  <cit> . in fact, potato, leafy spurge, and poplar all exhibited the momentary peak in ethylene or ethylene perception that is linked with ed induction as verified by several studies on similar aspect  <cit> . another finding on leafy spurge showed contradictory results during pd as revealed by microarray analysis; at least ten ethylene responsive genes were highly induced but were repressed during ed and ecd  <cit> . in our study, transcripts related to ethylene signaling pathway showed synchronized expression patterns, with higher etr levels in sb vs pd and lower levels of ctr1-like transcripts in pd vs ed. based on our results, we suggest that ethylene signaling might be involved in endodormancy release.

CONCLUSIONS
as stated above, the results obtained so far allow for the development of a hypothesis regarding the molecular mechanism underlying bud dormancy. by comparing the transcriptomes among three stages, the potential contribution of various pathways in this method became evident. this work implicated several pathways, including plant hormone signaling as well as secondary metabolites biosynthesis. further confirmation of most enriched pathways and degs will be the major emphasis of future studies.
