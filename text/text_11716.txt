BACKGROUND
fruit-bearing plants can be broadly classified into two groups based on the type of fruit ripening: climacteric or non-climacteric  <cit> . in climacteric species, e.g. apple, banana, tomato and avocado, there is a sudden rise in respiration at the onset of ripening, which is accompanied by autocatalytic ethylene synthesis  <cit> . by contrast, there is little or no ethylene production in mature non-climacteric fruits, e.g. grape, citrus spp, strawberry and pineapple  <cit> . however, there are many features of fruit ripening that are common to both climacteric and non-climacteric species indicating that there is overlap in the molecular mechanisms underlying the ripening process in both types, despite the differences in respiration and ethylene production. ripening has a major impact on the organoleptic properties of the fruit, such as aroma, flavour, sweetness, acidity, colour and firmness . although the quality of some climacteric fruits generally deteriorates rapidly after peak maturity, limiting the potential market available to commercial fruit producers and providing suitable conditions for pathogen infection, there are some climacteric fruits that store for longer periods . in contrast, some non-climacteric fruits tend to have a longer shelf life with fewer post-harvest losses during storage and transport, but non-climacteric fruits that are very perishable are also found   <cit> . in nature, fruit ripening must be tightly coordinated with seed development to ensure that fruit consumption and seed dispersal by animals occurs only when the seeds are fully mature and viable. thus there is both scientific and commercial interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms that differentiate climacteric from non-climacteric fruit ripening.

climacteric fruit ripening has been extensively investigated in tomato  . most of the enzymes, receptors and other factors involved in ethylene synthesis, perception and signalling were first identified from analysis of ethylene response mutants in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , and orthologous proteins that are key components of the climacteric response have been found from comparative studies in tomato . in addition, analysis of tomato mutants with impaired fruit ripening has revealed a number of transcription factors that are positive regulators of ripening including: ripening inhibitor  <cit> , non-ripening  <cit> , colorless non-ripening  <cit> , tomato agamous-like- <dig>  <cit>  and the homeobox protein hb- <dig>  <cit> . a member of the apetala <dig> family has been identified as a negative regulator of ripening  <cit> . despite these advances, the molecular mechanisms involved in the initial triggering of the climacteric and the factors that determine the fruit’s responsiveness to exogenous ethylene remain largely unknown  <cit> . furthermore, our knowledge of how metabolic changes and other aspects of fruit ripening are coordinated is fragmentary in both climacteric and non-climacteric species . only recently, epigenetic studies in tomato have suggested that epigenome modifications are important for the control of fruit ripening, and that they may work in concert with ethylene and fruit-specific transcription factors for the transition of fruit to the ripening competent stage  <cit> .

non-climacteric ripening has mostly been studied in strawberry, grape and citrus spp . however, comparison of these species with tomato has had limited success in elucidating the mechanisms that differentiate climacteric and non-climacteric ripening because of interspecific differences in gene/protein profiles and expression patterns that are unrelated to ripening. integrative comparative analyses of transcript and metabolite levels have been performed in pepper and tomato during ripening  <cit>  revealing new information about the metabolic regulation during climacteric and non-climacteric fruit development in these two closely related species. melon is highly unusual in having both climacteric and non-climacteric varieties within the one species, making this an ideal subject to investigate the fundamental basis of the different ripening programs .

climacteric melon varieties, such as the reticulatus and cantalupensis groups , exhibit a characteristic burst of respiration and ethylene production at maturity  <cit> . this is usually accompanied by softening of the fruit, production of aromatic volatile compounds , fruit abscission, and ethylene-independent biosynthesis of β-carotene  <cit> , which gives a characteristic orange colour to the flesh . in contrast, non-climacteric melon varieties, such as the inodorus type  <cit>  do not undergo a respiratory burst or autocatalytic ethylene production. the fruits also have little aroma as they do not produce volatile esters, remain firm when ripe, are generally white-fleshed, and do not abscise from the mother plant. the lack of aroma or other obvious signs of ripeness make it more difficult for the grower to assess the optimal time for harvesting of these types, but this is offset by their longer shelf life.

to date, most investigations performed to improve knowledge of melon fruit ripening have been focussed on the analysis of climacteric types  <cit> . a transcriptional analysis during fruit development and ripening in melon has been performed in the climacteric lines pi  <dig> and dulce  <cit> , but the study was limited to genes associated with sugar accumulation  <cit>  and the transcript data are not publicly available. a detailed transcriptomic analysis of the mature-fruit abscission zone in the védrantais climacteric melon type has also recently been reported, identifying candidate genes associated with the induction of fruit abscission  <cit> . so far there are no studies describing transcriptomic changes during fruit development in non-climacteric fruit types.

the aim of the work presented here was to identify genes specific to climacteric or non-climacteric ripening by comparing patterns of gene expression during fruit development in melon varieties of the two types. comparative transcriptomics in melon has been made possible by the development of a microarray with probes for over  <dig>  melon unigenes  <cit>  and sequencing of the melon genome  <cit> . we relate the observed changes in transcript abundance with changes in ethylene production, sugar levels, carotenoid content, and fruit firmness to identify candidate genes involved in determining these and other traits associated with fruit ripening.

RESULTS
climacteric and non-climacteric fruit types display distinct patterns of ethylene production and sugar and carotenoid accumulation
two melon varieties, cv. védrantais  and cv. dulce , were chosen as representatives of the climacteric type and compared with cv. piel de sapo  and accession pi  <dig>  as non-climacteric types . ved and dul fruits showed a burst of ethylene production, peaking at  <dig> and 37 days after pollination , respectively, while ps and pi had lower and constant levels of ethylene production . when 1000 ppm of exogenous ethylene was applied to melons at the pre-ripe stage for 24 h at 20 °c, ved and dul fruits increased the production of endogenous ethylene, whereas ps and pi did not respond to the external treatment. we measured the expression of several ethylene related genes on ps, pi and dulce, both in control and in ethylene treated fruits by qrt-pcr . these results showed that the climacteric dulce fruit increases the expression of ethylene inducible genes, compared with control fruits, when fruits where exogenously treated. however insensitive fruits, such as ps and pi, seem not to be affected by external ethylene . these results confirmed the expected climacteric/non-climacteric behaviour of the four genotypes and suggest that the non-climacteric phenotypes of ps and pi may be due to impairment in ethylene production and/or sensing and downstream responses to exogenous ethylene.fig.  <dig>

ripe ved and dul fruits have orange flesh, whereas the flesh of ps is white . pi has an outer region of green flesh and an inner core of orange flesh. consistent with these visual phenotypes, the concentration of carotenoids increased in orange-fleshed melons during ripening , whereas ps had very low carotenoid levels even in the mature fruits . in mature fruits, β-carotene was by far the most abundant carotenoid, with trace amounts detected even in the white-fleshed ps . in addition to β-carotene, accession pi also accumulated substantial amounts of lutein, violaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and α-carotene . lutein and violaxanthin are accessory pigments in photosynthetic tissues, suggesting that these may have originated from the outer, green-fleshed regions of the pi fruit. for all genotypes there was a gradual decline in the firmness of the fruit during development, but in ps firmness remained constant from  <dig> dap onwards .table  <dig> carotenoid content of mature melon fruit from védrantais , piel de sapo , dulce  and pi  <dig> . data are mean ± s.d. . n.d. not detected



in climacteric melon varieties, fruit maturity is recognisable by the distinct aroma of the fruit, softening of the fruit, and often by the abscission of the fruit from the plant. in contrast, non-climacteric varieties do not show such obvious signs of ripeness, making comparison of genotypes at equivalent stages of development problematic. however, increasing sweetness is a feature common to some varieties from both climacteric and non-climacteric melons as they ripen and is one of the most important quality traits for the consumer. therefore, we measured fruit sugar content at 5-day intervals to assess whether this could be used as an objective measure of ripeness for the non-climacteric varieties. within each genotype there was little variation over time in the glucose and fructose content of the fruits between 5 days after pollination  and maturity at  <dig> dap  or abscission of the fruit at 45– <dig> dap  . sucrose levels were very low in young developing fruits  of all genotypes and then rose dramatically from  <dig> dap  or  <dig> dap  onwards , suggesting that sucrose accumulation could be used as a marker for the onset of ripening. in all four genotypes there was considerable variation in sucrose content between individual fruits during the later stages of ripening, but the average sucrose content of ps fruits reached a plateau at  <dig> dap, changing little thereafter up to  <dig> dap. in contrast, pi fruits showed a clear drop in sucrose content by  <dig> dap. in subsequent experiments, maturity was defined by abscission of the fruits for ved  and dul , while for ps  and pi  maturity was considered to be the last time point where the fruits had high sucrose content. statistical analysis supporting differences in sugars accumulation is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> soluble sugar content of melon fruits. developing fruits were harvested from ved, dul, ps and pi at 5-day intervals from pollination until maturity, and the concentrations of glucose, fructose and sucrose at each sampling time were measured enzymatically



microarray analysis: microarray design, validation and global analysis
an oligo-based microarray was designed for transcriptomic analysis of melon fruits. the microarray contained  <dig>  probes based on a previously validated microarray  <cit>  but arranged in a modified 4-plex design, covering  <dig>  melon unigenes derived from expressed sequence tags. the microarray has already been used to study the transcriptomic response during infection of melon with watermelon mosaic virus  <cit>  or monosporascus cannonballus  <cit> . these unigenes represent  <dig>  genes in the melon genome , with an additional  <dig> unigenes with no assigned hit in the annotated melon genome . triplicate samples of developing  and mature fruits  were collected for extraction of total rna. after quality control checks, the rna was reverse transcribed and the resulting cdna hybridized to microarrays.

the microarray expression data were validated by real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  of  <dig> gene transcripts in the four genotypes at each sampling time, using cyclophilin <dig>  as a reference gene . from pairwise comparisons of microarray and qrt-pcr data, the mean  pearson’s correlation coefficient for the  <dig> genes was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating good overall agreement between the two methods .table  <dig> validation of microarray expression data by quantitative rt-pcr . pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for microarray and qrt-pcr data for  <dig> gene transcripts. icugi indicates the international cucurbit genomics initiative version  <dig>  gene identifiers for each unigene 



hierarchical clustering analysis of the normalized microarray data gave three main clusters . immature  fruits from all four genotypes were clustered together along with slightly older fruits  from the two climacteric varieties . fruits at intermediate stages of development  and mature fruits from ps and pi were clustered together with dul fruits at  <dig> dap . the most divergent group  included mature fruits from ved and dul, along with ved fruits at  <dig> dap, which coincided with the peak in ethylene production .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering analysis by upgma  with bootstrap, according to the differentially expressed genes, using the average of three biological replicates. pi , dul , ps  and ved  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> dap and h . bootstrap values are only shown when lower than  <dig>  a: ripe non climacteric fruits, b: unripe climacteric and non climacteric fruits and c: ripe climacteric fruits



microarray significant profiles  analysis  <cit>  was conducted, with time as a continuous variable, to identify genes in each genotype that were differentially expressed at the four stages of development . ps, pi, ved and dul showed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes, respectively . genes that were differentially expressed with time were compared across the four genotypes and classified into groups that were common to two, three or four genotypes, or were uniquely changed in only one genotype . there were  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed over time in all four genotypes and a further  <dig> genes in at least three genotypes . among the pairwise comparisons, there were  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed only in the non-climacteric genotypes , and a much larger number  only in the climacteric varieties .fig.  <dig> venn diagram containing the differentially expressed genes shared by the four genotypes



the differentially expressed genes were classified into gene ontology  categories using fatigo  <cit> . for most metabolic and developmental pathways there were no significant differences between genotypes for genes linked to those pathways. the main exceptions were the under-representation of genes associated with metabolism of nitrogen compounds and the over-representation of genes in the multicellular organism process category in ps compared with the other three genotypes .

further global analysis of the data was done by k-means clustering. this separated the  <dig> differentially expressed genes into nine different clusters based on their temporal profiles during fruit development . the genes in each cluster are listed in additional file 8: table s <dig>  the corresponding go terms from each cluster were analysed and the over-represented go terms for each cluster are also shown in additional file 8: table s <dig>  in cluster c <dig>  genes showed decreasing expression throughout development in ved, dulce and ps, but not in pi. pi genes also showed weaker responses than the others in clusters c <dig> and c <dig>  expression of the genes in cluster c <dig>  showed a strong downward trend as the fruits approached maturity in pi, ved and dul, with a weaker decrease in ps. based on their go terms, many of the  <dig> genes in this cluster are related to photosynthesis and other plastid-related processes . down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis during fruit development has also been reported in grape  <cit> . the genes in cluster c <dig>  showed a sharp rise in expression from  <dig> dap in the two climacteric varieties, but were only marginally up-regulated or not at all in the two non-climacteric genotypes. many of the  <dig> genes in this cluster are related to biosynthetic processes and translation .fig.  <dig>

climacteric and non-climacteric genotypes differ in expression of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling related genes
ethylene is synthesized from s-adenosyl methionine in a two-step pathway catalyzed by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase . the melon genome contains eight acs and five aco genes  <cit> . four acs genes were represented on the melon microarray: cmacs <dig>  cmacs <dig>  cmacs <dig> and cmacs <dig> . cmacs <dig> is known to be fruit specific and ripening related as its expression increases in climacteric fruit after the burst of ethylene  <cit> . as this gene was not present on the microarray its expression was measured by qrt-pcr. expression of cmacs <dig> increased up to  <dig> -fold during ripening not only in the two climacteric varieties  but also in non-climacteric pi . from the microarray analysis, it was observed that cmacs <dig>  a previously uncharacterized member of the melon acs gene family, was strongly induced in ved and dul fruits, coinciding with the climacteric burst of ethylene production . only two ests for cmacs <dig> are present in the international cucurbit genomics initiative  database, both from fruit tissue from climacteric melon types, suggesting that it is specifically expressed in climacteric fruit types.fig.  <dig> expression of deregulated genes involved in the ethylene and carotenoid pathways. a: cmacs <dig> , b: cmacs <dig> , c: cmaco <dig> , d: cmath , e-h: cmerebp , i-j: cmnam , k-l: cmmads , m: cmhd-zip , n-o: cmf-box , p: cmorg , q: cmsgr  and r: cmagm 



four out of the five melon aco genes annotated in the melon genome were represented on the microarray: cmaco <dig>  cmaco <dig>  cmaco <dig> and cmaco <dig>  cmaco <dig> expression increased during ripening in both the climacteric varieties and in pi, but was relatively constant throughout fruit development in ps . the changes in cmaco <dig> expression were also confirmed by qrt-pcr .

the expression of genes related to ethylene perception and signalling was also analysed. three ethylene receptors have been identified in the melon genome . cmetr <dig> and cmetr <dig> are represented on the microarray and their transcripts detected, but neither showed substantial differences in expression between genotypes or sampling times . similarly, expression of the melon ethylene-insensitive3-like transcription factor genes  was constant throughout fruit development and ripening in all genotypes . a putative n-acetyltransferase hookless <dig> gene , similar to an ethylene response gene from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , was strongly induced during ripening in climacteric fruits and pi, but showed no significant change in expression in ps during ripening .

there are several classes of transcriptional regulators implicated in downstream ethylene signalling pathways, such as trans-acting ethylene-responsive element binding proteins . fifty-four melon unigenes with homology to known erebp genes were represented on the microarray, and expression of some of these differed greatly between the melon genotypes during fruit development and ripening. expression of the melon erebp-like unigenes ccl2943contig <dig>  ccl6170contig <dig>  ccl5010contig <dig>  cci_03-a07-m13r_c and ccl1517contig <dig> increased during ripening in all genotypes except ps . two other related unigenes, c15d_17-c05-m13r_c and ccl3475contig <dig>  were constantly and highly expressed in ps, but down-regulated in climacteric fruits concomitantly with the burst of ethylene production .

other gene families involved in ethylene regulation and signalling during ripening encode several classes of transcription factors as mads, nam/nac, f-box and hd-zip  <cit> , and differentially expressed genes belonging to these classes are discussed below in a specific section dedicated to transcription factors.

differential expression of carotenoid related genes
genes encoding enzymes or regulators of carotenoid biosynthesis were identified from the melon genome sequence  <cit>  and those represented on the melon microarray are listed in additional file 10: table s <dig>  a cmggh gene  encoding a putative geranylgeranyl reductase  was much more strongly expressed in the genotypes with orange  or green/orange  fruit flesh than in the white-fleshed ps . this enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytyl moiety of chlorophyll  <cit> , but might also be involved in salvaging the phytyl moiety when chlorophyll is degraded, producing geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which is the precursor of carotenoid biosynthesis. other genes encoding enzymes of carotenoid biosynthesis did not show major differences in expression between the orange or orange/green and white-fleshed genotypes. however, a lycopene epsilon cyclase  gene was strongly induced in pi from  <dig> dap to maturity but not in the other three genotypes . this enzyme catalyses the initial reaction in the main pathway of lutein synthesis via α-carotene  <cit> , so increased expression of lycopene epsilon cyclase might account for the higher α-carotene and lutein contents of mature pi fruit compared to the other genotypes .

a number of transcription factors have been associated with regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in other species, and nine melon homologs of these were represented on the microarray . expression of the tomato apetala <dig> gene was reported to be negatively correlated with carotenoid accumulation  <cit> , and a similar correlation was seen for its homolog in melon, cmerebpf  . another ethylene responsive transcription factor gene, cmerebp/rap2- <dig>  was more highly expressed in orange-fleshed melon fruits than in ps  and showed a positive correlation with carotenoid accumulation like its rap2- <dig> homolog in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . expression of a leucine zipper homeobox protein gene, cmhd-zip , increased during ripening in orange-fleshed melons but not in ps . repression of the homologous tomato gene  inhibited ripening and carotenoid accumulation in the fruits  <cit> .

carotenoid accumulation can be also affected by changes at the whole-plastid level. chloroplastic heat shock proteins  affect the conversion of chloroplasts to non-photosynthetic chromoplasts, which in turn affects the pigment profile of the plastids  <cit> . expression of cmorg , which is orthologous with a dnaj-like protein encoding gene in the orange  mutant of cauliflower, was relatively constant in ps, but increased from  <dig> dap in the orange-fleshed melons, especially ved . accumulation of β-carotene in the cauliflower org mutant is associated with a metabolic process that triggers the differentiation of plastids into chromoplasts rather than changes in expression of genes encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . the cmorg gene maps to a region of the melon genome containing the white flesh colour  locus  <cit> , and thus is a strong candidate gene for this locus.

the tomato stay green  mutant is unable to degrade chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins during senescence, leading to retention of chlorophyll and has effects on fruit ripening  <cit> . a melon ortholog of the tomato stay green gene, cmsgr , was more strongly induced during ripening in orange or orange/green flesh than in white-fleshed ps . over-expression of tomato agamous-like <dig> , a mads box transcription factor, decreased carotenoid and ethylene levels, suppressed chlorophyll breakdown, and down-regulated expression of ripening-associated genes in the fruit  <cit> . expression of a melon agamous  homolog was higher in ps and pi than ved and dulce at  <dig> dap, consistent with the lower carotenoid content of the former two varieties, but the expression pattern of this gene shifted at later time points and its expression was similar in all four genotypes at maturity .

differential gene expression between vedrantais and piel de sapo
although many genes showed differential expression in the two climacteric varieties compared to non-climacteric ps, the expression patterns in pi were intermediate, suggesting that pi shows some characteristics of climacteric varieties, even though it does not display a classical climacteric burst of ethylene production . the near isogenic line sc3-5- <dig>  which contains two introgressions of pi in the background of ps, shows a climacteric ripening phenotype  <cit> , indicating that pi alleles of qtls ethqb <dig>  and ethqv <dig>  are capable of inducing ethylene production in ps, and that the absence of ethylene production in pi may be due to mutations in other genes. as the inclusion of this genotype in the comparative transcriptomic analysis might obscure some of the differences between climacteric and non-climacteric varieties, we analysed differentially expressed genes between only one variety of each ripening type, ved and ps, to see if this might reveal more clearly genes that are specifically associated with climacteric or non-climacteric ripening. these two varieties are representative of the two major types of melon in commercial production for the fresh fruit market. the ved and ps microarray datasets were compared using the significance analysis of microarrays  tool in the tm <dig> software package  <cit>  and differentially expressed genes are listed in additional file 11: table s <dig>  the data were also analysed using robin software  <cit>  and differentially expressed genes were categorised using mapman ontology to identify which processes are likely to be transcriptionally regulated during ripening of climacteric and non-climacteric fruits  <cit> .

ethylene biosynthesis and signalling
mapman displays of genes that are differentially expressed in mature ved and ps fruits are shown in figs.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the red squares represent genes that were more highly expressed in ved and the blue squares the genes that were more highly expressed in ps. the genes and their expression levels are listed in additional file 11: table s <dig>  in the pathway of ethylene biosynthesis , cmsam <dig> , cmacs <dig>  and cmaco <dig>  were more highly expressed in ved than in ps . similarly, two genes for downstream components of the ethylene signalling pathway, cmath  and cmert  were  <dig> to 5-fold more highly expressed in ved than ps. the cmrap2- <dig> gene , encoding an erebp ethylene-responsive transcription factor was also more highly expressed in ved, whereas related ethylene-responsive element-binding factors such as c15d_17-c05-m13r_c and ccl3475contig <dig> unigenes were more highly expressed in ps.fig.  <dig> differential expression of ethylene biosynthesis related genes in mature ved and ps fruits. differences in gene expression were visualised using mapman  <cit> . the red squares represent genes that were more highly expressed in ved and the blue squares the genes that were more highly expressed in ps. the genes and their expression levels are listed in additional file 11: table s8

carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis related genes
among genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis, cmchye/lut <dig>  and cmpsy <dig>  were more highly expressed in ved than ps, whereas cmpsy <dig> , cmcrtiso  and cmzep  were preferentially expressed in ps . carotenoids are synthesized from the isoprenoid precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate , and the cmggps gene  was expressed at a higher level in ved than ps fruits, as was the cmggh  involved in metabolism of ggpp and the phytyl moiety of chlorophyll . genes encoding proteins involved in light harvesting and the photosynthetic electron transport chain were strongly expressed in both genotypes at  <dig> dap. during ripening, there was a large decrease in expression of photosystem ii related genes in ved so that at maturity their expression was much higher in ps than ved . however, some chlorophyll a-b binding protein and atp synthase  genes showed the opposite pattern .

transcription factors
a total of  <dig>  transcription factor genes were represented on the microarray and  <dig> of these were differentially expressed at different stages of development. at maturity,  <dig> transcription factor genes were more highly expressed in ved fruits than in ps, while  <dig> showed the opposite pattern . among the differentially expressed transcription factor genes, the most common classes were nac/nam, myb, ap <dig> domain, bzip, mads-box, bhlh and sbp-box proteins, which are also the main types of transcription factors that are differentially expressed during tomato fruit ripening  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> fruit-expressed unigenes encoding nam/nac-domain proteins were represented on the array. there was very wide variation in expression of these genes between genotypes and developmental stages. of particular interest was a nac domain transcription factor gene, cmnac/ja , which is homologous with the tomato nor gene  <cit> . cmnac/ja was expressed at a lower level in ps than in ved and dul at harvest. in contrast, the expression of the nac-domain unigene ccl3226contig <dig> increased during ripening in ps but decreased in pi, ved and dul .

the mads box protein ripening-inhibitor  was proposed to function early in the transcriptional activation cascade regulating ripening-related processes, including ethylene production and/or signalling  <cit> . seven mads-box related genes were represented on the microarray. two of these genes, cmmads <dig>  and ccl5689contig <dig>  were specifically down-regulated and up-regulated in the climacteric genotypes, respectively .

an hb- <dig> homeobox protein transcription factor  was recently reported to regulate fruit ripening in tomato  <cit>  by binding to the slaco <dig> promoter, thereby activating this gene’s expression and therefore fruit ripening. the melon unigene ccl1434contig <dig> has homology with hd-zip transcription factors. its expression strongly declined during development of climacteric fruits, showed a smaller decrease in pi but increased during ripening in ps . the expression of other transcription factor genes from this family increased during ripening in climacteric fruits, but not in ps .

f-box proteins are involved in regulation of key proteins involved in ethylene signalling by targeting them for degradation via the polyubiquitin-26s proteasomal pathway. in tomato, silencing of the f-box genes sl-ebf <dig> and sl-ebf <dig> resulted in a constitutive ethylene response phenotype, an accelerated plant senescence and earlier fruit ripening, suggesting that they are integral components of ethylene-dependent developmental processes  <cit> . the role of these f-box proteins in tomato ripening would be to target ein <dig> for degradation, thus down-regulating ethylene signalling. several f-box protein genes were found to be differentially expressed between genotypes during fruit development and ripening . among these, unigene ccl2643contig <dig> was strongly induced in climacteric fruits, and to a lesser extent in pi, during ripening, but was expressed at a lower level and decreased during ripening in ps . in contrast, expression of unigene ccl891contig <dig> was relatively constant in the non-climacteric genotypes but decreased after the burst of ethylene production in ved and dul .

there was also differential expression of erebp, myb and wrky protein genes and transcription factor genes associated with auxin signalling and the ubiquitin pathway, but different members of these gene families showed opposite trends, with some more highly expressed in ved while others were preferentially expressed in ps .

sugar and cell wall metabolism
fruits of all four melon genotypes accumulated high levels of sucrose as they ripened . sucrose is stored primarily in the vacuoles of the pericarp parenchyma cells and is the major determinant of fruit sweetness, which is one of the most important organoleptic traits for the consumer. melon, in common with other cucurbits, is a symplastic phloem loading species that exports raffinose and stachyose as well as sucrose from source leaves to sink tissues, such as developing fruits  <cit> . imported raffinose family oligosaccharides are hydrolysed by α-galactosidases, releasing sucrose and galactose. the latter is phosphorylated by galactokinase  and the resulting galactose 1-phosphate converted to other hexose-phosphates, providing the substrates for synthesis of sucrose by sucrose-phosphate synthase  and sucrose-phosphate phosphatase . there are multiple genes encoding α-galactosidase in melon  <cit>  and several were highly expressed in developing melon fruits , although the predominantly expressed α-galactosidase gene differed between ved and ps . there were only minor differences in expression of gk, sps and spp genes between the two varieties .

sucrose can be catabolised by sucrose synthase or invertase. expression of a cminv gene , encoding a soluble  acid invertase, was almost  <dig> times higher in ved than ps . in contrast, one of the cmcwinv genes , encoding a cell wall invertase, was preferentially expressed in ps. expression of two cminvinh genes , encoding invertase inhibitor proteins, was about  <dig> times higher in ps than ved. the highly expressed vacuolar invertase in ved might limit the accumulation of sucrose during ripening, and contribute to rapid post-harvest decline in sucrose levels. catabolism of sucrose by invertase will not only diminish the sweetness of the fruit, but also feed sugars into respiratory pathways that produce organic acids, such as malate, that impart a stale flavour to the fruit. even though one of the cmcwinv genes was highly expressed in ripe ps fruits, cell wall invertase might not have access to intracellular  stores of sucrose. the high expression of invertase inhibitors might be expected to inhibit the invertase. these invertase and invertase inhibitor expression patterns could be an important factor in maintaining high sucrose levels in ps at maturity and also limit post-harvest losses of sucrose, thus contributing to the long shelf life of this variety.

the overall firmness of melon fruits decreases as they ripen in non-climacteric as well as climacteric varieties , although localized softening at the proximal end of the fruit is particularly pronounced in climacteric types. genes encoding polygalacturonases , glucan endo- <dig> -β-glucosidases  and β-d-xylosidases  are known to be induced by ethylene  <cit>  and several of these were more strongly up-regulated during ripening in ved than ps . increased expression and activity of these enzymes is expected to promote cell wall degradation and softening of the fruit. however, other cell wall related genes  were more highly expressed in ps than in ved, suggesting that loss of fruit firmness in ps is mediated by a different set of enzymes and is probably independent of ethylene signalling.

other differentially expressed genes
when the sam analysis was performed, a total of  <dig> unigenes showed a ≥2-fold higher expression in ved than in ps and  <dig> unigenes showed a ≥2-fold higher expression in ps than in ved . apart from genes already described before, genes that were notably up-regulated in ved compared to ps included: two udp-glucosyltransferases cci_13-f09-m13r_c and cpsi_24-f06-m13r_c , an anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase cci_35-a04-m13r_c , a β- <dig> -glucanase-like protein ccl3761contig <dig> , an l-allo-threonine aldolase ccl2708contig <dig>  and a bidirectional sugar transporter ca_19-h06-m13r_c. apart from genes already described before, genes that were more strongly expressed in ps than ved included: a cytochrome p450-like protein c15d_31-d11-m13r_c , hsf <dig> cssh6a3_c , a deoxyhypusine synthase ccl449contig <dig> , f-box proteins c15d_35-a07-m13r_c and cps_21-e08-m13r_c, and several proteins related to auxin or gibberellin signalling. auxin signalling is known to be involved in the initiation of ripening in the non-climacteric strawberry fruit  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
there is massive re-programming of transcription during fruit development and ripening in climacteric and non-climacteric melon varieties, with many gene expression changes common to both types. however, major differences in gene expression were observed in the climacteric varieties, ved and dul, when compared with non-climacteric ps, especially genes related to ethylene biosynthesis and signalling. changes in flesh colour during ripening appear to be linked to conversion of chlorophyll containing chloroplasts into carotenoid containing chromoplasts, including chlorophyll degradation and recycling of the phytyl moieties, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . an up-regulation of genes involved in the synthesis of isoprenoid precursors of carotenoids during ripening of orange-fleshed ved melon, but not the white-fleshed ps, was recently reported  <cit> . by contrast, only minor changes were observed here in genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the carotenoids themselves.

many transcription factors showed differential expression when climacteric and non-climacteric fruits where compared, suggesting that transcriptional regulatory networks differ between varieties and contribute to differences in fruit ripening behaviour. neither ps nor pi exhibited a burst of ethylene production during fruit ripening, and so were classified as non-climacteric varieties. however, other features of pi fruits, such as the high carotenoid content and induction of some ethylene biosynthetic genes, were more similar to the climacteric varieties ved and dul. in many respects, the transcript profile of pi represented a midpoint between the climacteric and non-climacteric genotypes. this intermediate behaviour suggests that ripening behaviour in melon should be considered as a continuous spectrum with classical non-climacteric varieties such as ps at one end and climacteric varieties such as ved and dul at the other. this suggests that climacteric ripening is not determined by a single gene but by the interactions of multiple genes, in agreement with the identification of multiple loci affecting ethylene biosynthesis in several mapping populations  <cit> . sucrose content can be used as a marker of melon fruit ripeness, even in non-climacteric varieties that show no visible or other signs of ripeness. the sucrose content of mature fruit and post-harvest losses of sucrose might be influenced by up-regulation of a specific soluble  acid invertase in climacteric melon fruits, while expression of two invertase inhibitors could explain the high and stable levels of sucrose in non-climacteric melon fruits, and thus be an important factor in their longer shelf-life.
