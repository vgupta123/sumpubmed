BACKGROUND
the high mobility group a <dig> gene  is highly expressed in virtually all poorly differentiated or refractory cancers studied to date, although its role in this setting is poorly understood  <cit> . hmga <dig>  encodes the hmga1a and hmga1b  chromatin remodeling proteins, which function in modulating gene expression  <cit> . these protein isoforms result from alternatively spliced mrna and differ by  <dig> internal amino acids present in the hmga1a isoform  <cit> . hmga <dig> proteins are members of the superfamily of hmg proteins named for their rapid electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels . the hmga family is distinguished by at-hook dna binding domains that mediate binding to at-rich regions in the minor groove of chromatin and includes hmga <dig> and hmga <dig> proteins  <cit> . after binding to dna, hmga <dig> proteins recruit additional transcription factors and histone modifying proteins to alter chromatin structure and form a higher order transcriptional complex or enhanceosome  <cit> . in concert with these factors, hmga <dig> proteins modulate gene expression. although its role in transcription is well-established, the downstream transcriptional targets regulated by hmga <dig> proteins are only beginning to emerge.

hmga <dig> proteins were first linked to cancer over  <dig> years ago when they were discovered as abundant, nonhistone chromatin binding proteins in human hela cervical cancer cells  <cit> . subsequent studies showed highly expression levels in poorly differentiated cancers, refractory hematologic malignancies, and the developing embryo, with low or undetectable levels in most adult, differentiated tissues  <cit> . hmga <dig> proteins induce oncogenic phenotypes in cultured cells, including enhanced proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, migration and invasive properties, and xenograft tumorigenesis when implanted into immunosuppressed mice  <cit> . hmga <dig> also promotes metastatic progression and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in a breast cancer model  <cit> . transgenic mice misexpressing hmga <dig> develop aggressive tumors involving all three germ layers  <cit> . conversely, inhibiting hmga <dig> expression or function in experimental models blocks transformation phenotypes such as proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, tumorigenesis, and metastatic progression  <cit> . further, hmga <dig> gene expression and protein levels correlate with adverse clinical outcomes  <cit> . for example, hmga <dig> gene expression was identified as a marker of poor outcome in pediatric brain tumors  <cit> . high hmga <dig> protein levels correlate with poor differentiation in pancreatic and breast cancers  <cit>  and decreased survival in pancreatic and lung cancers  <cit>  by immunohistochemical analysis in primary tumors. more recently, hmga <dig> was identified as a key transcription factor enriched in embryonic stem cells and poorly differentiated cancers of the breast, bladder, and brain  <cit> . expression of hmga <dig> and  <dig> other transcriptional regulators predicted poor survival in these cancers. hmga <dig> is also enriched in hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . together, these studies implicate hmga <dig> as a key regulator in tumor progression, poor differentiation, and refractory disease.

to better elucidate the role of hmga <dig> in tumor progression, we used genome-wide expression profile analysis in our hmga1a  transgenic mouse model for lymphoid malignancy. these mice succumb to acute lymphoid leukemia by 8- <dig> months of age with complete penetrance. here, we identified genes dysregulated by hmga <dig> early in tumorigenesis and in well-established tumors. our studies reveal distinct pathways activated by hmga <dig> at different stages in tumor development. although further studies are needed, our results uncover cellular pathways that could serve as potential therapeutic targets in lymphoid and other tumors with aberrant expression of hmga <dig> 

methods
hmga <dig> transgenic mice lymphoid samples
the hmga <dig> mice have been previously reported  <cit> . briefly, the murine hmga1a cdna is driven by the h-2k promoter and immunoglobulin μ enhancer, which is expressed in b and t cells. all mice develop lymphoid malignancy by 5- <dig> months and die from their disease by 8- <dig> months  <cit> . the female mice also develop uterine sarcomas  <cit> . rna was isolated from the splenocytes at different stages of developing tumorigenesis, including  <dig> months , and at  <dig> months . splenic rna was chosen because these organs are abundant sources of lymphoid cells and they become uniformly infiltrated with leukemic cells in all transgenics by 9- <dig> months. splenocytes from nontransgenic littermates were harvested at the same time points as controls.

isolation of total rna
total rna was isolated from control and transgenic mouse spleens that were harvested at necropsy and immediately suspended in rnalater  to prevent rna degradation. from each spleen sample, approximately 15- <dig> mg of spleen tissue was homogenized in rlt buffer  with the power gen  <dig> homogenizer . total rna was purified using the rneasy mini kit with dnase treatment  to eliminate genomic dna according to the manufacturer's instructions. rna was measured with the nanodrop  <dig>  and purity was assessed with a  <dig> bioanalyzer . total rna was isolated from  <dig> spleens from each age group and pooled as a single sample to a final concentration of  <dig> ng/μl for microarray analysis. two independent, pooled samples were prepared at each time point from transgenic and control mice.

microarray analysis
the microarray analysis was performed at the johns hopkins university school of medicine microarray core facility as previously described  <cit> . briefly, mrna was converted into double stranded cdna using a t7-oligo  promoter primer sequence and purified for use as a template for in vitro transcription. transcription reactions were performed with t <dig> polymerase and biotinylated nucleotide analog/ribonucleotide mix for crna amplification. the biotinylated crna was prepared in the hybridization mix with oligonucleotide b <dig> and four control bacterial and phage cdna. labeled crna was hybridized to the mouse  <dig>  <dig>  genechip array  containing  <dig>  probesets corresponding to  <dig>  unique genes according to the manufacturer's instructions. experiments were performed with two independent samples at each time point from the transgenic and control mice. all reported microarray data are miame compliant and stored in the gene expression ominbus . the data can be accessed at geo under accession number gse <dig> 

data analysis
we used both a parametric statistical approach  and a nonparametric approach  <cit>  to generate a list of differentially expressed genes. the overlapping, differentially expressed genes from both approaches were then analyzed for specific cellular pathways and gene set enrichment patterns.

all data were analyzed using the partek genomics suite v <dig>  . the data was adjusted for gc content, normalized with quantile normalization and mean probe summarization by robust multichip average   <cit> , and expression fold change values were determined. significantly dysregulated probesets were identified using spotfire decisionsite  <dig> . probes were selected if they fulfilled two criteria: 1) change in expression of ≥  <dig> , and, 2) a paired p-value indicating significance. paired p-values were obtained through partek's paired sample t-test to reduce batch effects by comparing samples prepared at the same time. we generated lists of probesets with a p ≤  <dig>  in addition to a more selective list with a p ≤  <dig> . further pathway and gene set enrichment analysis were conducted on the dataset with p ≤  <dig> .

as an alternative method to the parametric approach, a nonparametric approach  was implemented as previously described  <cit>  and the results from the two statistical approaches were compared for concordance. briefly, the cam approach was developed for high-dimensional data analyses from microarray gene expression studies with limited sample numbers per comparison group. because we noted a batch effect with different scale and expression distributions in the replicate experiments, we separately analyzed the data generated from the comparison of the transgenic and control samples from each experiment and compared the differentially regulated gene sets between replicates for concordance to identify a common gene set from each time point.

the list of probesets was filtered for duplicates. all probesets that were not annotated or ambiguously annotated were checked by blast comparison of their sequences against the online ncbi37/mm <dig> mouse genome sequence in the ucsc genome browser  to ensure accuracy.

pathway analysis
to elucidate cellular pathways regulated by hmga <dig> early in tumorigenesis, ingenuity pathway analysis  of selected genes from our microarray data was used. the ipa score was generated for each comparison and indicates the likelihood that the focus genes present in the network could have been obtained solely by chance. a score ≥  <dig> was considered significant because it represents a 1/ <dig>  chance that the network contains the specific focus genes by random chance alone  <cit> . for each network, pathways or functions from the following categories were generated:  <dig> ) disease or disorder-related functions,  <dig> ) molecular and cellular functions, and,  <dig> ) physiological system development and function. the pathway with the most significant p value was determined from each analysis and the top biologic function was defined as the pathway or function from all categories with the most significant p value.

gene set enrichment analysis
gene set enrichment analysis was performed as previously described using gsea v <dig>  software to identify published gene expression profiles that share genes with the profiles identified in this study   <cit> . the p value indicates the significance of the overlap.

quantitative real-time pcr validation 
the change in expression of candidate genes that were differentially regulated by hmga <dig> by microarray approaches was confirmed by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr was performed as we described  <cit> , except for the following modifications. total rna was isolated from mouse spleens using the rneasy kit  as recommended by the manufacturer. cdna was generated by reverse transcription of total rna  and subsequently analyzed by qrt-pcr using the abi sybr green assay kit. reaction conditions were  <dig> min at 50°c,  <dig> min at 95°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 95°c and  <dig> s at 60°c. qrt-pcr results were analyzed by normalizing expression to the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . primers for all genes excluding hmga <dig> and gapdh were designed using the idt primer quest software and the primer sequences are listed . the hmga <dig> and gapdh primers have been previously reported  <cit> .

knock-down of hmga <dig> in human leukemia cells
hmga <dig> expression was knocked-down using sirna to hmga <dig>  as we previously described  <cit> , but with the following modifications. jurkat cells , a human t-cell acute lymphoblastic cell line, were transfected with the hmga <dig> sirna  by nucleofection with the amaxa nucleofector kit v  according to the manufacturer's instructions. control jurkat cells  were treated with the sigenome control non-targeting control sirna . cells were subsequently seeded onto six well plates and collected at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours for protein and mrna. to document hmga <dig> knock-down, both qrt-pcr for mrna and western analysis for protein were performed as previously described  <cit> .

RESULTS
the genes differentially regulated by hmga <dig> early and late in tumorigenesis
nonparametric cam approach
early in tumorigenesis ,  <dig> probes representing  <dig> unique genes were significantly up-regulated and  <dig> probes or  <dig> unique genes were significantly down-regulated in the hmga <dig> transgenics compared to controls in replicate samples by the nonparametric correlative analysis of microarrays  approach  <cit> . in established tumors at  <dig> months,  <dig> probes or  <dig> unique genes were significantly up-regulated and  <dig> probes or  <dig> unique genes were significantly down-regulated in the transgenics compared to controls in replicate samples .

the number of differentially expressed probes hits and corresponding unique genes identified by a parametric  approach or nonparametric  approach are shown the overlap of genes identified by both approaches is also shown for p ≤  <dig>  or ≤  <dig> .

parametric partek analysis
by the parametric approach  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated by ≥  <dig> -fold with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated  early in tumorigenesis. with a more stringent p value of ≤  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated by ≥  <dig> -fold with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. in the established tumors at  <dig> months,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated  with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . with the p value of ≤  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated by  with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated . there was a very high correlation between the differentially regulated genes identified in experiment  <dig> compared to experiment  <dig>  with an r >  <dig>  at both the early and late time points.

the cellular pathways dysregulated by hmga <dig> early in tumorigenesis
nonparametric analysis
to identify pathways regulated by hmga <dig> early in tumorigenesis, we first analyzed the differentially expressed genes at  <dig> months identified by cam using ipa . from the list of differentially regulated genes,  <dig> pathways had a significant network score  and the pathways involved in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, hematologic system development and function, and inflammatory response had the most significant network score . in this network, interferon beta  is an important node, which functions as a cytokine in antiviral defense and was previously identified as a transcriptional target of hmga <dig>  <cit> . ifnβ is involved in cell surface signaling, b cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and the positive regulation of innate immunity. interferon alpha  is another major node in this network, which also functions as a cytokine involved in antiviral defense. in addition, the nuclear factor-κb  transcription factor complex was identified as a major node and members of this family are known to interact with hmga <dig> and form a higher order transcriptional complex or enhanceosome that functions to regulate gene expression of specific transcriptional targets, such as ifnβ  <cit> . nfκb plays an important role in immune function and mediating inflammatory signals. nfκb also appears to have a central role in tumorigenesis, particularly in cancers linked to inflammation  <cit> . jnk, or the family of c-jun n-terminal kinases, was also identified as a central node. jnks were originally defined as kinases that phosphorylate c-jun within its transcriptional activation domain and include the mitogen-activated protein kinases   <cit> . these proteins belong to a family of serine/threonine kinases that modify the activities of nuclear and mitochondrial proteins through phosphorylation. mapks respond to stress stimuli and are involved in inflammation and cytokine production as well as regulating proliferation, survival, migration, metabolism, apoptosis, transcription and translation. the p <dig> mapk complex was also identified as a node and includes mapk <dig>  mapk <dig>  mapk <dig>  and mapk <dig>  like the jnk complex, these protein kinases also respond to extracellular stress stimuli, including cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic changes  <cit> , transducing extracellular signals into diverse cellular pathways involved in cellular homeostasis. the top disease-related function identified in the network was the inflammatory response while cellular development  was the most the top biologic function and the most significant molecular and cellular function . the most significant physiologic system development and function category from this network was the hematologic system, which includes normal development of all hematopoietic cells .

the top functions identified by ingenuity pathway analysis from each category are shown and include:  <dig> ) diseases and disorder-related function,  <dig> ) molecular and cellular functions, and,  <dig> ) physiological system development and function. * denotes the top biologic function, defined as the function from all  <dig> categories with the most significant ipa score.

parametric analysis
we also analyzed the differentially expressed genes at  <dig> months identified by partek with ipa. from the list of differentially regulated genes, there were  <dig> significant networks, and the most significant network  was involved in immunological disease, cell-mediated immune response, and cellular development. in this network, important nodes include  <dig> ) erk 1/ <dig> complex  which function in responding to cellular stress or dna damage and induce apoptosis, chemotaxis, migration, proliferation, and inhibit differentiation  <cit> , and,  <dig> ) the interleukin  <dig> complex , which function as pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in t-cell mediated cytotoxicity, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, the immune response, cell cycle arrest, migration, and t cell and b lymphocyte proliferation  <cit> . similar to the ipa analysis of the cam data at  <dig> months, jnk, p <dig> mapk, infβ, and nfκb were also identified as important nodes. cellular function and maintenance , was the top biologic function and the most significant molecular and cellular function. as with the nonparametric analysis, the inflammatory response was the most significant disease-related function and the hematological system was the most significant physiologic system function . differentially expressed genes with a p value of ≤  <dig>  were also assessed by ipa and identified pathways involved in gene expression, cell death, and hematologic development and function .

analysis of concordant genes identified by the parametric and nonparametric approaches
finally, we analyzed the overlap of the differentially expressed genes identified using the nonparametric cam and the parametric partek approaches at  <dig> months with ipa. there were  <dig> significant networks, and the most significant network  was involved with immunological disease, cellular development, and cellular function and maintenance. in this network, the nfκb and interleukin  <dig> complexes were important nodes. the inflammatory response was the top biologic function and the most significant disease-related function. cell-to-cell signaling interaction was the most significant molecular and cellular function . as before, the hematologic system was the most significant physiologic system function . of note, the metastasis suppressor protein  <dig>  gene was repressed and appears as a node in networks from all three analyses early in tumorigenesis . in addition, the eomes  stem cell gene was up-regulated and identified as a node from all three analyses. the eomes gene plays a crucial role in embryogenesis during both trophoblastic development and gastrulation. it is also involved in brain development and the differentiation of cd8+ t cells.

the transcriptional networks dysregulated by hmga <dig> late in tumorigenesis
nonparametric analysis
from the list of differentially expressed genes identified by cam at  <dig> months, there were  <dig> significant networks, and the pathway with the most significant network  was involved in inflammatory response, immunological disease, and neurological disease . in this network, important nodes included:  <dig> ) interleukin  <dig>  an anti-inflammatory cytokine induced by inflammation, cellular stress, and the immune response which down-regulates th <dig> cytokines and enhances b cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production  <cit> ,  <dig> ) t-cell receptor complex, which is involved in t-cell activation  <cit> , and,  <dig> ) the nfκb complex, which was also a prominent node in the pathway analyses at  <dig> months. in contrast to the pathways identified early in tumorigenesis, the top disease-related function was cancer. cellular development was the top biologic function and the most significant molecular and cellular function. as with the analysis early in tumorigenesis, the hematological system was the most significant physiologic system function .

parametric analysis
there were  <dig> significant networks identified from the list of differentially expressed genes at  <dig> months identified by partek and the most significant network  was involved in dna replication, recombination, and repair, cancer, and cell cycle . in this network important nodes included:  <dig> ) the tp <dig>  tumor suppressor, which is mutated in many cancers and involved in apoptosis, genomic instability, inhibition of angiogenesis, and cell cycle arrest  <cit> ,  <dig> ) cdk <dig> , which is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that is a key regulator of cell cycle progression  <cit> , and,  <dig> ) the alcohol group acceptor phosphotransferases, which include multiple proteins such as mapks, protein kinases, and cyclin dependent kinases  <cit> . as above, cancer was the most significant disease-related function. cell cycle was the top biologic function and the most significant molecular and cellular function. cell-mediated immune response was the most significant physiological system function . differentially expressed genes with a p value of ≤  <dig>  were also assessed by ipa and identified pathways involved in cancer, gene expression, and reproductive system disease .

analysis of concordant genes identified by parametric and nonparametric approaches
we identified  <dig> significant networks from the overlap of the differentially regulated genes at  <dig> months with the most significant network score  involved in cell cycle, cellular development, and cellular growth and proliferation . in this network, important nodes included:  <dig> ) cyclin b <dig>  which regulates the g2/m transition in cell cycle progression, mitosis, apoptosis, checkpoint controls, growth and maturation, and is up-regulated in diverse cancers  <cit> ,  <dig> ) cyclin a , which regulates cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and checkpoint controls and is also elevated in diverse tumors  <cit> ,  <dig> ) the e2f complex, which includes important regulators of proliferation and cell cycle progression  <cit> , and,  <dig> ) cdkn2a tumor suppressor, which is involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence  <cit> . the cdkn2a locus is deleted or silenced in many forms of cancer, including t- and preb cell leukemia  <cit> . as before, nfκb was a central node. cell cycle progression was the top biologic function and the most significant molecular and cellular function. cancer was the most significant disease-related function and the hematological system was the most significant physiologic system function .

validation of selected genes dysregulated by hmga1
to validate our microarray gene expression profile analysis, we performed qrt-pcr for candidate genes identified as differentially expressed by microarray analysis . at the early time point in tumorigenesis , we assessed  <dig> genes and confirmed differential expression of all  <dig> , with  <dig> up-regulated  and  <dig> down-regulated . moreover, the fold-changes of these genes by microarray analysis and qrt-pcr were similar . at the  <dig> month time point, we assessed expression of  <dig> candidate genes and confirmed differential expression in all cases. six genes were up-regulated  and one  was down-regulated. many of these genes function in inflammation   <cit> , metastases   <cit> , poor outcome cancers   <cit> , or stem cells   <cit> . in addition, a subset of these genes have been identified as markers for poor outcomes in lymphoid and other cancers   <cit> . thus, our validation studies confirmed the differential expression of all of the genes we assessed .

a subset of genes identified as differentially expressed by microarray analysis were validated by qrt-pcr at both the early and late time points. the fold-change found by microarray and qrt-pcr were similar for all genes assessed by qrt-pcr.

hmga <dig> transcriptional targets found in cells from human lymphoid tumors
to determine if any of the genes dysregulated by hmga <dig> in the transgenic model are relevant to human lymphoid malignancy, we knocked-down hmga <dig> in jurkat cells  and assessed the expression of the  <dig> genes validated in the transgenic model by qrt-pcr . we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were also significantly down-regulated in the jurkat t-all cells, including eomes, il2rb, and cd8b1; see additional file 2). these data indicate that a subset of the genes dysregulated by hmga <dig> in our transgenic model are also relevant in human t-all cells.

geneset enrichment analysis
to determine if the gene expression profiles identified in our study overlap with previously reported gene sets, the molecular signatures database  was interrogated  <cit> . we found that the gene set derived from up-regulated genes in the established tumors by both the parametric and nonparametric approaches had the most significant overlaps  with previously published gene sets . the three gene sets with p ≤ 10- <dig> included progenitor t cells  <cit> , embryonic stem cells  <cit> , and neural stem cells  <cit> . the gene set with the highest significant overlap  was derived from a gene expression profile study of human intrathymic t cells at different stages in maturation  <cit> . the overlapping gene set from this study was from transcripts enriched in intrathymic t progenitors  and double positive  t cells compared to more mature t cells. these results indicate that the hmga <dig> tumors share gene expression profiles with the dp, less differentiated, thymic progenitors. the second gene set with highly significant overlap  was derived from a study of gene expression profiles in mouse embryonic stem cells compared to differentiated brain and bone marrow cells  <cit> . similarly, the third gene set was derived from the same study  and included genes enriched in neural stem cells compared to differentiated brain and bone marrow cells  <cit> . not surprisingly, this prior study reported overlap between the embryonic and neural stem cell gene sets. these results suggest that hmga <dig> drives transcriptional networks that promote the maintenance of a poorly differentiated, stem-like phenotype in our transgenic model.

the molecular signature database was interrogated for overlaps with the gene sets identified in our analyses. the most significant overlaps  are shown above with the relevant p value. 

discussion
here, we report for the first time cellular pathways induced by hmga <dig> at different stages of tumorigenesis. despite its widespread overexpression in virtually all poorly differentiated tumors and aggressive hematologic malignancies studied to date  <cit> , there were no prior studies to identify transcriptional targets dysregulated by hmga <dig> during tumor progression. moreover, fewer than  <dig> bona fide hmga <dig> transcriptional targets have been reported to date  <cit> . the ifnβ gene is the most extensively studied downstream gene target of hmga <dig>  hmga <dig> binds to the 5' utr of this gene and promotes cooperative binding of nfκb  and additional transcription factors  <cit> . together with these factors, hmga <dig> bends dna and forms a transcriptional enhancer complex or "enhanceosome" that is essential for the expression of this gene. emerging evidence indicates that hmga <dig> is a key transcription factor in embryonic stem cells and diverse tumors with poor outcomes  <cit> . these findings suggest that hmga <dig> drives a refractory, stem-like state in cancer by inducing specific genes and their cellular pathways. hence, studies to identify the hmga <dig> transcriptome during tumorigenesis should have important implications, not only for cancer, but also for development and the stem cell phenotype.

early in tumor development, we found that genes involved in the inflammatory response are dysregulated by hmga <dig>  nfκb was identified as a key node involved in hmga <dig> signaling, consistent with prior studies demonstrating that hmga <dig> forms an enhanceosome with nfκb  <cit> . our results also indicate that nfκb is intimately involved with malignant transformation in this model, both early in tumor initiation, and later, in established tumors. notably, most of the previously reported hmga <dig> transcriptional targets include nfκb regulatory elements in their promoter regions and many participate in mediating inflammatory pathways . given the recent evidence that inflammation is a precursor lesion in some cancers, this link between hmga <dig>  nfκb, and inflammation are consistent with a model whereby these proteins cooperate to induce inflammatory signals and drive transformation. this result also opens up potential avenues for therapeutic and even preventive interventions to block tumor initiation and/or progression. in preliminary studies, we found that crossing the hmga <dig> transgenics with mice null for the p <dig> subunit of nfκb results in an increase in lymphoid tumor burdens . the nfκb transcriptional complex is comprised primarily of p65:p <dig> heterodimers in which p <dig> functions as an activator, and p <dig>  which lacks a transcriptional activation domain, is thought to function as an inhibitor. the p50/p <dig> heterodimers are thought to activate transcription of canonical nfκb genes, whereas p <dig> homodimers repress transcription. indeed, mice deficient in p <dig> have been shown to have enhanced nfκb activity and inflammatory responses  <cit> . although further confirmatory studies are needed, our preliminary results suggest that excess nfκb activation  could lead to enhanced tumorigenesis induced by hmga <dig> 

the up-regulation of inflammatory pathways during hmga1-induced tumorigenesis is also consistent with our previous studies demonstrating that anti-inflammatory agents  interfere with sarcomas in our hmga <dig> transgenics  <cit> . the anti-inflammatory drugs did not significantly affect the lymphoid tumors, however, suggesting that cox- <dig> may not be consistently up-regulated in these tumors. indeed, we assessed cox- <dig> expression in the lymphoid tumors and found up-regulation in only 50% of lymphoid cells early in tumorigenesis; it was not up-regulated in the established tumors . moreover, the tumor size was decreased in ~50% of the treated tumors, suggesting that the inhibitors function only in tumors up-regulating cox- <dig>  we also identified the ifnβ gene as a node involved in hmga <dig> function early in tumorigenesis, which further validates both our model system and experimental approach because this is an established hmga <dig> target gene. moreover, we uncovered additional cytokine nodes that further support the role of hmga <dig> in driving inflammatory pathways during lymphoid tumorigenesis, including ifnα and il- <dig>  in addition, jnk, erk1/ <dig> and map kinases were key nodes early in tumorigenesis, additional pathways that could be pharmacologically manipulated in therapy. interestingly, all networks from this early time point show down-regulation of the mtssi gene, which encodes the metastasis suppressor protein  <dig>  repressing a suppressor of metastases represents a previously undescribed pathway through which hmga <dig> promotes tumor progression. the eomes gene was also up-regulated in all networks and this gene is crucial in embryonic development. previous studies also show that eomes are overexpressed in colorectal cancer  <cit> .

later in tumorigenesis, we identified genes involved in cell cycle progression as a central pathway. although hmga is thought to induce cellular proliferation in some settings  <cit> , its role in cell cycle progression has not been extensively studied and warrants further investigation, particularly because cell cycle inhibitors are available and newer agents are under development. our results suggest that hmga <dig> up-regulates expression of the e2f proliferation genes, and at least three key cyclins or cyclin complexes, including the cyclin a complex, cyclin b <dig>  and cyclin e, the latter of which is a downstream transcriptional target of e2f <dig>  these findings are consistent with previous studies in adipocytes expressing a carboxyl-terminal, truncated hmga <dig> that showed increased e2f <dig> protein levels and e2f <dig> dna binding activity  <cit> . subsequent studies demonstrated that hmga <dig> interacts with the rb protein and interferes with rb-mediated repression of e2f <dig> transcription and cell cycle progression in neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . thus, hmga <dig> could promote tumor progression by inducing a molecular program for cell cycle progression and proliferation with up-regulation of e2f <dig> and cyclins. cdk <dig> was also identified as a node in the parametric analysis of differentially expressed genes in the established tumors, which could further augment cyclin function through activation by phosphorylation. the tcr complex was identified as a node in the nonparametric analysis and functions in t cell activation and function. interestingly, hmga <dig> null mice have a paucity of t cells, further substantiating an important role for hmga <dig> in t cell development and function  <cit> . in addition, two prominent tumor suppressor loci were identified as major nodes in the established tumors, namely cdkn2a and tp <dig>  notably, the cdkn2a locus is deleted in up to 90% of cases of t-cell leukemia  <cit> , while this locus is silenced through methylation in other forms of leukemia. the cdkn2a locus encodes the ink4a and arf tumor suppressor proteins which function upstream of rb and p <dig>  respectively, and serve to maintain the tumor suppressor function of rb and p <dig>  it is not clear if cdkn2a is mutated in our mouse tumors, although we have preliminary evidence that expression of at least the ink4a is decreased in a subset of the lymphoid tumors . tp <dig>  the other tumor suppressor node identified in our analysis, is among the most frequently mutated tumor suppressors in cancer with mutations occurring in most human tumors. tp <dig> functions by helping cells respond to dna damage and other cellular stresses, acting as a "gate keeper" of the integrity of the genome  <cit> . it is possible that tp <dig> is inactivated through ink4a/arf mutation or inactivation in our tumor model, similar to myc-induced lymphoid tumors in mice  <cit> . future studies are needed to assess the functional status of these tumor suppressors in the hmga <dig> transcriptional networks and are likely to uncover additional pathways that could be targeted in hematologic and other malignancies driven by hmga <dig> 

we also found that gene sets regulated by hmga <dig> overlap with stem cell gene sets, including embryonic and neural stem cells compared to differentiated cells. the gene set enrichment analysis also showed overlap with immature t cells. these results indicate that hmga <dig> drives transcriptional pathways shared by poorly-differentiated, stem-like cells. because prior studies demonstrate that cancers with stem-like molecular signatures have poor outcomes  <cit> , it is likely that hmga <dig> drives a refractory, advanced tumor by inducing these pathways in tumor cells. hmga <dig> is also highly expressed during embryogenesis and it may regulate similar cellular pathways during development and promote tumorigenesis when these pathways are re-activated in the postnatal period.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we found that hmga <dig> induces genes involved in inflammatory pathways early in lymphoid tumorigenesis and genes involved in embryonic stem cells, cell cycle progression, and proliferation in established tumors. hmga <dig> also dyregulates genes and pathways that function in stem cells, cellular development and hematopoiesis at both early and late stages of tumorigenesis. these results provide insight into hmga <dig> function at different stages in tumor development and point to cellular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets in lymphoid and other human cancers with aberrant hmga <dig> expression.
