BACKGROUND
ever since the essential role of angiogenesis in tumor formation and metastasis was proposed by folkman in  <dig>  increasing attention has been paid to vascular targeted therapy  <cit> . the vasculature is an attractive target because vascular endothelial cells are more genetically stable than tumor parenchymal cells and less likely to acquire drug resistance, and vascular targets on endothelial cells are readily accessible to systemically delivered agents  <cit> . based on these advantages, efforts have focused on identifying specific molecules expressed on the surface of tumor vascular endothelial and perivascular cells  <cit> . finding such tumor vascular targets may help make anticancer drugs more selective, through their targeted delivery, thus providing higher therapeutic efficiency while simultaneously decreasing systemic toxicity.

with this goal, we previously used in vivo screening of a phage-displayed peptide library to identify a cyclic 7-mer peptide, cgnsnpksc, called gx <dig>  which binds specifically to the human gastric cancer vasculature  <cit> . immunohistochemical staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and immunofluorescence confirmed the targeting activity of gx <dig> peptide, indicating that gx <dig> might be used as a novel vascular marker for human gastric cancer  <cit> . the potential bioactivities that might accompany the targeting function of gx <dig>  and how it might be combined with other agents for antitumor therapy, are investigated here. we conducted a series of tests to determine the effects of gx <dig> on vascular endothelial cells, and on tumor angiogenesis and growth. in addition, we fused gx <dig> to recombinant mutant human tumor necrosis factor , a variant of the tnfα cytokine that is well known for its potent antitumor activity and is less toxic than tnfα  <cit> , to see if the fusion protein could achieve synergistic therapeutic efficacy. these studies provide important preclinical evidence for the use of gx <dig> in targeted antitumor therapy.

RESULTS
gx <dig> inhibits endothelial cell proliferation in vitro by inducing apoptosis
gx <dig> was tested for its ability to inhibit both endothelial cells and tumor cell proliferation by the tetrazolium salt  assay. the results showed that gx <dig> could reproducibly suppress, in dose-dependent manner, the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  and huvec with tumor endothelial cell characteristics , generated by culturing the cells in tumor-conditioned medium  <cit> . differences in the relative cell number between cells treated with gx <dig> and the control peptide  were significant at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm for co-huvec  , and were significant at  <dig> and  <dig> μm for huvec  . in addition, gx1-induced inhibitory effects were more obvious in co-huvec than in the non-tumor conditioned huvec . in contrast, no such differences were detectable in gastric adenocarcinoma sgc <dig> cells , further demonstrating the selectivity of gx <dig> 

subsequently using flow-cytometry , it was found that gx <dig> , but not pep <dig> , induced apoptosis in co-huvec compared to the phosphate-buffer saline  control  . however, assessment of cell cycle distribution by fcm showed no significant difference between the test and control groups. these results indicated that inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation by gx <dig> was, at least in part, through induction of apoptosis. we further detected the expression level of the apoptosis related molecule caspase  <dig> by western blot. as shown in figure 1f, the expression of cleaved caspase  <dig> was up-regulated in gx <dig>  treated co-huvec. in contrast, no changes were detected in pep <dig>  or pbs treated cells. in brief, gx <dig> appeared to induce apoptosis of co-huvec by up-regulating the expression of caspase  <dig> 

gx <dig> inhibits angiogenesis in vivo by a chorioallantoic membrane  assay
since gx <dig> could repress vascular endothelial cell proliferation in vitro, we carried out cam assays to see if the peptide could inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. disruption of angiogenesis was observed in gx1-treated chicken embryos, with attenuated and tortuous microvessels in the cam and fewer angiogenic vessels contacting the disk, when compared to the pbs control group. no significant differences existed between the pep  <dig> and pbs control groups, with both showing well-developed and leaf vein-like vascular nets .

gx <dig> conjugated to rmhtnfα concentrates in gastric cancer
in addition to proapoptotic and anti-angiogenic activity, gx <dig> was also assessed for its ability to act as a targeting delivery vector in combination therapy for gastric adenocarcinoma. gx <dig> was fused to rmhtnfα as previously reported  <cit>  and its tumor-targeted distribution was investigated. elisa was used to analyze the amount of gx1-rmhtnfα in tumor and non-tumor tissues, and the results showed that gx1-rmhtnfα accumulated in tumor tissues over time. the radioactivity of gx1-rmhtnfα relative to rmhtnfα  significantly increased in tumor tissue from  <dig>  at  <dig>  h to  <dig>  at  <dig> h . in contrast, this ratio decreased in liver within  <dig> h after administration of the agent , and no evident trend was observed in other major organs .

we took planar scintigrams of tumor-bearing mice injected with 99tcm-gx1-rmhtnfα, to further confirm the in vivo tumor-targeting. compared to 99tcm-rmhtnfα , the radioactivity in tumor tissue was much higher in the 99tcm-gx1-rmhtnfα group . the tumor/muscle radioactivity ratios of 99tcm-gx1-rmhtnfα and 99tcm-rmhtnfα were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, at  <dig> h . simultaneously, immunofluorescence was used to detect the specific location of gx1-rmhtnfα. gx1-rmhtnfα, but not rmhtnfα, was found to co-localize with cd <dig> which was used as a positive control in tumor vasculature . collectively, these results suggest that the fusion protein acquired the ability to target tumor vessels and may lead to more selective drug delivery to tumors.

gx1-rmhtnfα inhibits co-huvec proliferation in vitro by inducing apoptosis
the mtt assay was used to detect the effects of gx1-rmhtnfα on endothelial cell proliferation, and showed that the fusion protein was significantly better at inhibiting co-huvec proliferation than rmhtnfα, with inhibition rates of 61% vs. 45% at  <dig> μm  .

to address whether the decrease in cell number was due to apoptosis induced by gx1-rmhtnfα, fcm was used to determine the apoptosis rate in co-huvec. the results showed that the apoptosis rates induced by  <dig> μm gx1-rmhtnfα or rmhtnfα were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively  . in contrast, no significant differences in cell cycle distribution were detected between the test and control groups. these results indicated that inhibition of vascular endothelial cells by gx1-rmhtnfα might be partly caused by induction of apoptosis.

effects of gx1-rmhtnfα on tumor growth in vivo
subsequently, using an in vivo tumor formation test, gx1-rmhtnfα was assayed for its effects on tumor growth. nude mice bearing human gastric adenocarcinoma xenografts were injected intravenously on alternate days with gx1-rmhtnfα , rmhtnfα , gx <dig>  or normal saline . mouse body weight, which is used as a major indicator of tnf toxicity  <cit> , and tumor mass volumes were assessed over time. tumor growth was significantly delayed by gx1-rmhtnfα treatment, and the average tumor volume of the gx1-rmhtnfα group was much smaller than that of the rmhtnfα group  . in addition, at the end of the test, mice treated with gx1-rmhtnfα had a higher average body weight than those treated with rmhtnfα  , suggesting that the fusion protein had less systemic toxicity than rmhtnfα alone.

since tnfα is known to alter vascular barrier function, we performed evan's blue assay to assess the effect of gx1-rmhtnfα on tumor perfusion. compared to rmhtnfα-treated mice, the gx1-rmhtnfα treated group showed a greater leakage of evan's blue dye in the tumor parenchyma. differences were statistically significant at  <dig>  mg/kg  . we therefore hypothesize that the gx1-rmhtnfα fusion protein selectively increases tumor vascular permeability and leads to higher local drug levels, which may play an important part in the antitumor mechanism of gx1-rmhtnfα.

discussion
to improve therapeutic indices and decrease systemic toxicity, more specific and selective anticancer agents that can discriminate between tumor and nonmalignant cells are urgently needed, along with the development of antitumor radiochemotherapy  <cit> . the discovery that angiogenesis plays a crucial role in tumor formation, and that vascular targeting approaches exhibit the advantages of easy accessibility and lower incidence of drug resistance, provides a possible path to creating these new anticancer agents  <cit> . several studies have pursued this strategy, including the application of phage display technology to pan for peptides that bind specifically to defined tissue targets  <cit> . using this technique, several homing peptides have been identified, including rgd, ngr and f <dig>  and many have showed promising results for imaging diagnosis and treatment of various tumors in preclinical or clinical investigations  <cit> . furthermore, some of these peptides have been conjugated to bioactive agents, including drugs, cytokines, procoagulant factors, photosensitizers and radionuclides, and have been included in antineoplastic therapies. initial results of these studies showed more selective and targeted drug delivery and fewer side effects  <cit> . however, to date, no such peptide has been identified that targets human gastric cancer.

previously, we used in vivo screening of a phage displayed peptide library to identify gx <dig>  a cyclic 7-mer peptide cgnsnpksc that binds specifically to the human gastric cancer vasculature  <cit> . autoradiography on different cell lines confirmed the targeting activity of gx <dig> toward the gastric cancer vascular endothelium, by showing that the binding affinity of gx <dig> was significantly higher in huvec cultured in tumor-conditioned medium than in huvec cultured in non-conditioned medium. no specific binding was observed in the human gastric carcinoma cell line sgc <dig> or in the immortalized gastric epithelial cell line ges cells  <cit> . furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence showed positive staining for gx <dig> in the vascular endothelium of human gastric adenocarcinoma, but not in heart, liver, muscle, spleen or normal gastric tissues  <cit> . in another study, using single photon emission computed tomography , gx <dig> labelled with 99tcmo4-  was observed to concentrate in tumor xenografts in nude mice  <cit> . collectively, these results indicate that gx <dig> is a novel vascular marker of human gastric cancer, and may lead to a new way of imaging diagnosis and targeted gastric cancer therapy.

since gx <dig> selectively targeted the vascular endothelium of gastric cancer, we investigated whether it had specific effects on tumor angiogenesis and growth. in this study, in addition to targeting, gx <dig> showed bioactivity by both mtt and cam assay, inhibiting vascular endothelial cell proliferation and hampering neovascularization. to probe into the possible mechanisms of these effects, the cell cycle distribution, cell apoptosis and the expression level of apoptosis related molecule caspase <dig> were detected by fcm and western blot assays. inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation by gx <dig> was observed, at least in part, to be through the up-regulation of caspase  <dig> expression and the induction of apoptosis. further tests including rt-pcr and gene microarray are underway to investigate the precise mechanisms.

in vitro analysis showed that huvec cultured in tumor-conditioned media partially acquire the characteristics of tumor vascular endothelial cells, such as enhanced tubule formation, cell proliferation, and migration  <cit> . furthermore, some proteins like vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and the integrin αvβ <dig> may be up-regulated in co-huvec, as is the case for other cancer endothelia  <cit> . these findings lead us to the hypothesis that gx <dig> receptors are up-regulated in co-huvec, reflecting the case in tumor vessels, and that more receptors may lead to greater selective affinity and stronger anticancer effects. this hypothesis is consistent with the mtt assay results, in which gx <dig> showed more significant inhibitory effects on co-huvec than on the parental huvec culture that was not exposed to tumor-conditioned medium.

to assess the possibility of using gx <dig> as a targeted delivery vector in combination with another antitumor molecule for treatment of gastric cancer, gx <dig> was conjugated to rmhtnfα. tnfα is a well-known, antitumor cytokine whose clinical application is hampered by severe systemic toxicity  <cit> . the novel mutant cytokine rmhtnfα shows higher antitumor efficacy and has been approved for clinical use in china  <cit> . our data showed that after fusion to gx <dig>  rmhtnfα was selectively delivered to target tumor vasculature sites. most important, gx1-rmhtnfα delayed tumor growth in vivo, with less loss of body weight compared to rmhtnfα alone . these results indicated that more targeted and efficient antitumor activity might be achieved by combining gx <dig> with other anti-tumor agents , for a significant reduction in systemic toxicity.

despite the encouraging results, some questions are still open, such as what the receptor is for gx <dig> on vascular endothelial cells, and how ligand-receptor interaction interferes with tumor angiogenesis. further studies are underway to answer these questions, and several candidate receptor molecules have been obtained. identification of the gx <dig> receptor will be a great help in understanding the mechanism of gx <dig> and will accelerate the development of clinical applications for gx <dig> in diagnosis and targeted treatment of gastric cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the data presented here, taken together with previously published results, demonstrate that gx <dig> is a novel vascular marker of human gastric cancer. for the first time gx <dig> is shown to have properties other than homing, including proapoptotic effects on vascular endothelial cells, and in vivo inhibition of neovascularization. furthermore, when conjugated to rmhtnfα, gx <dig> selectively delivered the fusion protein to target tumor sites, leading to higher antitumor efficiency with less systemic toxicity. these findings demonstrate great potential for developing gx <dig> both as a targeted vector and as an antiangiogenic agent in the diagnosis and treatment of human gastric cancer.
