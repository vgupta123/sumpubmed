BACKGROUND
identification of plant gene function is important not only to better understand how plants grow and develop, but also for potential exploitation of this information for molecular and/or traditional crop breeding. however, extensive gene duplication and polyploidy events during evolution mean that plants carry multiple copies of the same gene as well as large numbers of closely-related genes  <cit> . therefore, for gene function studies, it is important to determine whether different copies of the same or related genes are functionally redundant or whether polymorphisms have been selected through evolution and led to functional specialisation  <cit> . reverse genetics approaches to answering these questions range from the development of transgenic plants where individual gene copies are silenced  <cit>  to the identification of mutants where gene copies have been either modified, inactivated by sequence alterations  <cit> , or completely deleted  <cit> . for the model plant arabidopsis, the availability of large numbers of t-dna  insertion lines makes it increasingly likely that knock-out insertion mutants can be identified for specific copies of selected closely-related genes to test for redundancy or a specific function  <cit> . in many other plants, including most of the important crop species, this task is not so straightforward and new technical approaches for the identification of mutations in specific gene copies are needed  <cit> .

mutant populations of many crop species including wheat have been developed through chemical mutagenesis, and mutations in a range of target genes have been identified in such populations using 'targeting induced local lesions in genomes'   <cit>  techniques. in tilling, a gene region is amplified from pools of genomic dna, amplified fragments allowed to re-anneal, and mutations detected by testing for mismatches between wild type and mutant heteroduplexes  <cit> . this technique is capable of detecting the point mutations, re-arrangements, and small deletions  <cit>  that chemical mutagens predominantly produce  <cit> , but it is not directly applicable to screening for whole-gene deletions. an additional technical difficulty in applying tilling to polyploid crop species such as wheat is that tilling requires independent amplification of homoeologous gene copies to prevent heteroduplexes forming between these closely-related sequences, as this can confound the subsequent data analysis. therefore, the development of new high-throughput methods that allow simultaneous detection of mutations in homoeologous genes in a single assay, as has recently been reported  <cit> , is certainly highly desirable for functional genomics studies in wheat and other polyploidy crop species.

recently, physical mutagenesis such as heavy ion irradiation  has been used to generate mutant populations of model, crop and ornamental plant species  <cit> . in contrast to chemical mutagenesis  which generates frequent point mutations and small deletions, hii generates a relatively high frequency of large  deletion mutations. however, the difficulty of detecting mutants that contain deletions of homoeologues of target genes has been a major factor limiting the application of this method to polyploid species.

bread wheat  is one of the most important food crops in the world and is hexaploid, comprising the a, b and d genomes with theoretically all genes present on each of the three homoeologous genomes  <cit> . similar to other plants, availability of genetic mutants that facilitate understanding of gene function is highly desirable in wheat. in addition, new genetic variation in mutants can be exploited in traditional plant breeding  <cit> . in wheat, well-recognised examples of the types of genes that are candidates for mutational inactivation are those that encode allergenic and nutritionally poorly tolerated grain proteins  <cit>  as well as grain quality genes such as those that influence starch composition  <cit> . an emerging new category of genes for which null mutations will be sought are disease susceptibility genes  <cit> . it has become apparent that pathogens often exploit essential cellular processes of their hosts for their own benefit during infection and that multiple host genes may be required to permit a susceptible infection  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated that inactivation of the pft <dig> gene of arabidopsis led to increased resistance to the fungal pathogen fusarium oxysporum  <cit> . the pft <dig> gene was initially identified as a positive regulator of shade avoidance  <cit> , and subsequently shown to encode a subunit of the plant mediator complex - a conserved multi-protein complex involved in the fine-tuning of gene expression in all eukaryotes  <cit> . we are interested to test whether the inactivation of orthologues of pft <dig> in wheat would have a similar effect on fungal disease resistance. the pft <dig> gene is highly suited for reverse genetic analysis and the development of a new screening method, because it is a single copy gene in the genomes of diploid species such as arabidopsis and rice, and a full-length cdna sequence from wheat is available  <cit> .

in the present study, we have developed a taqman single nucleotide polymorphism  detection method suitable for high-throughput screening of a hii population of hexaploid wheat to identify homoeologous deletion mutants. this method relies upon uniquely fluoro-labelled homoeologue-specific taqman snp-detection probes to identify the presence or absence of homoeologous copies of a gene of interest. although the taqman snp-detection pcr system has been widely used as a high-throughput method for allelic discrimination in humans  <cit> , this method has not been used extensively in plants, with some limited application to the differentiation of snps in genes that confer herbicide tolerance  <cit> . the application of taqman probes to screening for gene deletions in drosophila has been demonstrated  <cit> . however, the methodology used in that study differed significantly to the method presented here as gene specific primer/probe combinations with generic probe fluoro-labelling were used in drosophila to assess the presence of diploid loci by comparing fluorescence from individual gene specific qpcrs on the same dna samples.

here we describe in detail the design, optimization, validation, and application of a new method for the identification of deletions for each of the three homoeologues of a wheat gene, using tapft <dig> as a model. using this method we have subsequently identified multiple deletion mutants for three additional wheat genes putatively involved in plant defence.

RESULTS
identification of tapft <dig> homoeologues in wheat
based on an existing full-length cdna sequence for a wheat orthologue   <cit>  of the arabidopsis pft <dig> gene in conjunction with the conserved intron-exon structure that exists in the orthologous single copy rice gene for pft <dig> , it was possible to design pcr primers  that would generically amplify overlapping fragments of all homoeologous copies of tapft <dig>  multiple  dna fragments amplified with conserved tapft <dig> primers from the wheat cultivar chara were cloned and sequenced. this resulted in the identification of five unique contigs  putatively corresponding to sequences that partially spanned between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted exons of three tapft <dig> homoeologues . the consensus exon-intron structure of the tapft <dig> gene in regions used for the design of the taqman probe assay and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  assay for validation are depicted diagrammatically in figure  <dig>  sequences corresponding to tapft <dig> homoeologues in chara were deposited into the ncbi database . the total polymorphism amongst tapft <dig> homoeologous sequences is given in table  <dig> 

probe-based detection of tapft <dig> homoeologues
the high-throughput technique we describe here for reliable amplification of tapft <dig> homoeologues from wheat is modified from a dual-labelled probe snp detection assay originally reported by livak  <cit> . based on sequences obtained for putative tapft <dig> homoeologues, a region of tapft <dig> suitable for the design of short fluorescent hybridisation probes that would distinguish different tapft <dig> homoelogues was identified  and three homoeologue specific taqman probes labelled with the fluorescent dyes fam, ned and vic were designed and synthesised. these probes were then used in qpcr together with a pair of conserved flanking pcr primers that would simultaneously amplify all three tapft <dig> homoeologues . as shown in figure  <dig>  this assay successfully amplified tapft <dig> homoeologues from the genomic dna isolated from chara.

validation of assay
before an extensive screening of mutagenized wheat populations was undertaken for identification of tapft <dig> deletion mutants, we hoped to validate the specificity of this assay by determining the chromosomal location of tapft <dig> using genetically well-characterized wheat lines . we obtained a series of nullisomic-tetrasomic wheat lines, each missing a single chromosome  substituted by an additional copy of a homoeologous chromosome   <cit>  as well as a comprehensive smaller deletion series of wheat lines  <cit> . these lines were generated using the cultivar 'chinese spring'. the probe assay functioned successfully against wild type 'chinese spring' , indicating that sequence in the targeted region was conserved between 'chara' and 'chinese spring'. this was confirmed in silico by performing a blast search of 5× chinese spring whole genome sequence  <dig> raw reads  with tapft <dig> sequence obtained from chara - reads with identical sequence to each of the homoeologous sequences in the region of assay design were detected. as shown in figure  <dig>  wheat lines individually missing chromosomes 5a, 5b and 5d lacked fluorescence from vic-, fam- and ned-labelled probes, respectively. this indicated that tapft <dig> was located on chromosome  <dig>  the location of tapft <dig> on homoeologous chromosomes 5a, 5b, and 5d, respectively, was confirmed independently using the tapft <dig> caps screen , which was also designed based on the obtained 'chara' sequence , but shown to function successfully for 'chinese spring' samples, as confirmed by blast searches at http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net.

to more specifically determine the genomic location of tapft <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  we screened additional deletion lines that contain smaller deletions on homoeologous chromosome 5a  <cit> . these experiments revealed that one line, 5al- <dig>  lacked the a genome homoeologue of tapft <dig> designated here as tapft1-a. 5al- <dig> was the largest long-arm chromosome  <dig> deletion available in the series and the absence of the amplification of tapft1-a indicated that this gene was located between the break point of 5al- <dig>  and the break point of the next largest chromosome  <dig> deletion, 5al- <dig>   <cit> . together, these experiments also confirmed that the assay was able to reliably detect presence and/or absence of tapft <dig> homoeologues in wheat.

identification of tapft <dig> deletion mutants
we next applied this assay for the identification of hii mutants that lack at least one of the tapft <dig> homoeologues. from the screening of approximately  <dig> individual hii mutant  lines of chara, nine 'definite' mutants were detected, with an additional two 'possible' mutants identified. mutants were considered 'definite' if efficient fluorescence increases for two of the three probes, with cts  below  <dig> was observed, in conjunction with very low or no fluorescence increase for the third probe for both replicates. mutants were considered 'possible' if one replicate failed, or if fluorescence from probes had a ct value greater than  <dig>  indicative of very low dna concentration in the sample. of the screened mutants, five samples  lacked fluorescence from vic-labelled probe  <dig>  indicating the absence of tapft1-a ; two samples  lacked fluorescence from fam-labelled probe  <dig>  indicating the absence of tapft1-b ; and four samples  lacked fluorescence from ned-labelled probe  <dig>  indicating the absence of tapft1-d . of the eleven putative mutants, seed stocks were not available for bw18m3- <dig> and bw19m3-132; and seeds of bw19m3- <dig> failed to produce viable seedlings. dna extracted from the remaining lines were screened using the probe-based screen in conjunction with the tapft <dig> caps screen and in this case, caps gels were also blotted and hybridised to a tapft <dig> probe to ensure specificity . the results of caps screening and hybridisation  demonstrated that genome-specific bands present in chara were missing in the designated mutants for samples even including the ones that were considered possible in the initial screening.

application of method to identification of deletions in other target genes
to confirm that the method described here performs routinely, we have subsequently chosen three additional wheat genes putatively encoding negative regulators of plant disease resistance and screened our hii mutant population to identify homoeologue deletions in these genes. the genes selected were: tanfxl <dig>  tacesa <dig>  and tapldb <dig>  tanfxl <dig> is the orthologue of the arabidopsis atnfxl <dig> gene demonstrated to be a negative regulator of salicylic acid  accumulation and sa-dependent defence genes. arabidopsis mutants lacking atnfxl <dig> show increased resistance to the compatible pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig>   <cit> . tacesa <dig> is the orthologue of the arabidopsis cesa <dig> gene shown to encode a susceptibility factor for the bacterial pathogen ralstonia solanacearum and the necrotrophic fungus plectosphaerella cucumerina. resistance in cesa <dig> mutants is believed to be conferred via an increase in aba-dependent defence gene expression, and alteration of cell wall structure, leading to the activation of novel defence pathways  <cit> . tapldβ <dig> is the orthologue of ospldβ <dig>  a rice phospholipase d gene demonstrated to act as a negative regulator of resistance to magnaporthe grisea and xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. knockdown of ospldβ <dig> results in induction of a range of defence related genes in rice  <cit> .

cdna sequences corresponding to putative wheat orthologues of these additional target genes were identified using arabidopsis and/or rice protein sequences as queries in tblastn searches of the ncbi wheat est sequence database. sequences for rice orthologues of atnfxl <dig> and atcesa <dig> were obtained by performing a tblastn search against the ncbi rice cdna sequence database. full genomic sequences are available for all annotated rice cdnas. therefore, putative intron/exon structure of corresponding wheat genes was determined by aligning wheat cdna sequences to rice genomic sequences for all genes. based on these alignments pcr primers were designed. pcr products were cloned and more than  <dig> individual clones were sequenced for each gene and, based on these sequences, the three putative homoeologous sequences were deduced. using these homoeologous sequences, assays were designed as for tapft <dig> and applied to the screening of the hii wheat lines. consequently,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> deletion mutants were identified for tanfxl <dig>  tacesa <dig>  and tapldβ <dig>  respectively, demonstrating that the assay is broadly applicable to deletion screening in wheat. details of the design and application of these assays are provided in table  <dig>

discussion
a greater understanding of the genetics underlying the phenotypic properties of crop species has improved our ability to manipulate genes responsible for unwanted characteristics. genes encoding certain grain proteins which can be allergenic or nutritionally poorly tolerated are well recognised examples of genes with unwanted characteristics  <cit> . many desirable characteristics are also known to be controlled by recessively inherited loci  <cit>  some of which have been shown to be non-functional alleles  <cit> . furthermore, in the last decade 'negative regulators' of plant resistance have been reported. loss-of-function mutants of these genes show increased resistance to specific pathogens  <cit> . it therefore seems likely that reverse genetics approaches that exploit the use of gene deletions in crop improvement will increase, especially whilst gm approaches for specific gene inhibition may be restricted in commercial use due to prohibitive legislation in many parts of the world.

in this article we outline a taqman snp-detection probe-based assay optimized for high-throughput screening to identify whole-gene deletion mutants in wheat and other polyploid species. the following strategy was followed to develop and validate the assay. first, sequence analysis was undertaken on the tapft <dig> gene to identify homoeologous sequences. this sequence information was then used to design a qpcr assay using specific taqman snp-detection probes that would discriminate the three tapft <dig> homoeologues in a single reaction. to confirm the ability of the assay to detect wheat lines missing a specific tapft <dig> homoeologue, it was applied to the screening of nullisomic-tetrasomic wheat lines  <cit> . chromosomal locations of tapft <dig> homoeologues were thereby identified, and validated using an independent caps-based assay. finally, automated qpcr screening of a wheat hii population to identify mutants for each tapft <dig> homoeologue was performed and identified mutants validated using the caps-based assay. after developing and validating this method using tapft <dig>  we applied it to the detection of homoeologue deletions of three additional target genes  and successfully identified multiple deletions for each within the hii population .

we used patented applied biosystems mgb-nfq taqman snp-detection probes for all assays . we chose this supplier because abi provided a flexible custom probe design service and assistance with the design of these assays to our specific criteria. however, a range of other snp-detection fluorogenic qpcr probes are available from other suppliers, and these may also be adaptable to this assay.

as outlined above, using the assay developed we were able to determine the chromosomal location of tapft1-a by screening nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of the wheat genotype chinese spring. we subsequently screened chinese spring deletion lines to narrow down its genomic location to a region between fl  <dig>  and fl  <dig>  on chromosome 5a, close to the centromere region . similarly, using nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of chinese spring, tapft1-b and tapft1-d were shown to reside on chromosomes 5b and 5d, respectively. lines with 5b and 5d chromosome deletions that are large enough to exclude these loci based on the location of tapft1-a were not available, and all screened 5b and 5d deletion lines possessed the respective tapft <dig> homoeologues. however, from the results of the nullisomic-tetrasomic lines in conjunction with the largest 5b and 5d long and short arm deletions screened, we could putatively assign tapft1-b to a location between 5bs fl  <dig>  and 5bl fl  <dig> ; and tapft1-d to between 5ds fl  <dig>  and 5dl fl  <dig> , and these locations are consistent with the location determined for tapft1-a. however, since none of the smaller 5b and 5d deletion lines screened lacked the respective copies, these finer chromosomal locations of tapft1-b and tapft1-d will require further definition in the future.

the location of tapft <dig> homoeologues on their respective homoeologous chromosomes was confirmed using a tapft <dig> caps assay  designed for validation of the probe-based assay. the chromosomal location of tapft <dig> in wheat is consistent with the demonstrated location of ospft <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which is syntenic to wheat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, blasting tapft <dig> against the phytozome v <dig>  database http://www.phytozome.net has revealed that putative sorghum bicolor sbpft <dig> and brachypodium distachyon bspft <dig> are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively - sorghum chromosome  <dig> and brachypodium chromosome  <dig> are indeed syntenic to wheat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . however, our results assigning tapft <dig> on wheat chromosome  <dig> conflict with a location of a  <dig> bp putative tapft <dig> est , which shows approximately 97% homology to tapft <dig> sequence that we obtained, on chromosome 7ds in the graingenes  <dig>  database http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/gg2/index.shtml. one possible explanation for this discrepancy might be the existence of a duplicate tapft <dig> locus. however, the results of our sequencing of tapft <dig> clearly showed the presence of only three distinct sequences in the hexaploid wheat genotype we used, arguing against the presence of such a duplicate locus. another possibility could be that a translocation of a tapft <dig> locus has occurred in the specific genotype used in mapping. another, more probable, explanation is that this est has been incorrectly mapped in the graingenes database.

prior to the development of this technique, screening of the hii lines used in this study for homoeologue deletions of a number of candidate genes had been performed using caps assays similar to that performed in this study for validation purposes. the key disadvantages of caps screening include: difficulty in identifying sufficient polymorphism for design of the assay, and high labour and time costs of performing large-scale screening. by exploiting probes designed to effectively discriminate between sequences differing by as little as a single base pair, this new assay requires only the most minimal polymorphism between homoeologues. the minimum requirement for successful design of the specific probes are the presence of individual snps specific for each homoeologue occurring within a region of suitable length for a qpcr amplicon , that can be amplified from each homoeologue in a single reaction. where possible, a single primer pair has been used for an individual assay. however, polymorphism in an otherwise desirable site for primer design can be accommodated via the multiplexing of primers showing identity to each of the polymorphic sequences, as for the tapldβ <dig> assay . with our previous screening using caps, a single researcher could process approximately  <dig> samples per day. in contrast, this new assay allows us to screen up to  <dig> individual samples  in approximately  <dig> hours. the time taken to perform the qpcr assay is the limiting factor for screening - a robotic set up of individual plates takes approximately one hour. using our equipment that allows pre-prepared optical plates to be stacked and continuously loaded and analysed, this theoretically allows for the processing of approximately twelve 384-well plates, corresponding to up to approximately  <dig> duplicated samples, in a  <dig> hour period, in an automated manner, by a single researcher.

it should be noted that, as for genome-specific pcr and caps-based deletion screening techniques, this assay is not suitable for the detection of hemizygous individuals  and is not amenable to sample pooling due to its reliance on detection of the lack of specific target sequence. although the ability to detect individuals hemizygous for a target locus would be advantageous, the accurate identification of hemizygous lines is inherently challenging as the target sequence remains present in these lines, albeit at half the concentration. whilst it is theoretically possible to discriminate copy number of a target locus using qpcr, we have found that when dealing with variation in dna sample concentration and quality that can be present in any large collection of samples such as those screened here, hemizygous individuals may not be identified with confidence using this method.

we chose to screen samples in duplicate to provide additional validation of putative mutants, and to cater for failure of a single reaction due to technical error. during the process of screening for homoeologous deletions of the four target genes, we have assessed approximate frequencies of conflicting screening results between duplicate reactions. technical errors leading to one successful and one failed reaction are indeed very low ; whilst mutant/non-mutant fluorescence profiles, indicative of false positive or negative results, are absent where ct values are <  <dig> and very rare for dna samples with low concentrations yielding ct values > <dig> . therefore, duplication for deletion screening using this method is arguably unnecessary, especially since downstream validation of indexed seed will be required for any identified mutant lines. by eliminating duplication, throughput of this method could be doubled, and cost per sample halved.

another technology that could be potentially explored for deletion screening in polyploid plant species is automated single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis -based capillary electrophoresis. theoretically, this technology could allow for the detection of homoeologue-specific target gene deletions. however, the logistics of such an application for this method are unknown, and a recent protocol for mutation screening using this technique indicates that throughput for sample screening   <cit>  is unlikely to be capable of matching that of the presented method .

recently, a modified tilling protocol for the screening of hexaploid wheat for mutations has been developed  <cit> . this method appears to be an extremely powerful tool for screening to detect point mutations and small deletions simultaneously within homoeologues of mutagenized wheat lines, such as those generated using ems  <cit> . the technique outlined here is not appropriate for the screening of homoeologues for non-specific point mutations and small deletions. rather, it is useful for detection of presence or absence of homoeologous copies of candidate genes in a mutagenized population within which lines possess frequent whole-gene deletions such as the hii population used in this study. for this purpose, this method has significant advantages over any other currently available technique. in addition, hii lines are considered non-gm; therefore, mutants with beneficial characteristics can be integrated into crop improvement programs. however, as for lines generated using chemical mutagenesis, hii lines can possess 'background' mutations. for reverse genetics approaches to crop improvement using this method in conjunction with a hii population, identified lines with beneficial characteristics can be relatively easily 'purified' by successive rounds of backcrossing and re-screening to remove the majority of such background mutations.

as reported here, our design and optimization of this technique has been performed in hexaploid wheat, which globally is the most significant polyploid crop plant. like wheat, many important plant species including cotton, canola and potato , triticale and oat , strawberry , and sugarcane  are polyploids. therefore, this technique has the potential to be adapted to many other polyploid species. in addition to screening for homoeologues in other polyploid species, this assay would be readily adaptable to the screening for duplicated gene copies or closely-related gene family members within diploid species so long as snps that allow the design of gene-specific fluorescent probes exist in the sequences to be identified. whole-genome sequencing efforts are currently underway in many polyploid and diploid crop plants including wheat. the availability of assembled whole-genome sequence information would facilitate the efficient design of assays for virtually any gene/s using this method.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a method for automated, high-throughput screening to detect and distinguish individual homoeologues of any wheat gene. we designed this method for the purpose of identifying homoeologous deletions of target genes within a resource of hii mutagenized wheat lines featuring frequent whole-gene deletions. this method is potentially applicable to the identification of homoeologous copies of a target gene within any polyploid species. it may also have utility for the identification of highly homologous genes  within diploid species.
