BACKGROUND
the cytokine transforming growth factor beta  is a member of the tgf-β superfamily consisting of  <dig> members including tgf-βs   <cit> . tgf-β <dig> is the predominant and more ubiquitous form. tgf-β ligands signal canonically through type i  and type ii serine/threonine kinase receptors  <cit> , and via the accessory  receptor endoglin in vascular endothelial cells  <cit> . tgf-β binding leads to phosphorylation of intracellular r-smads  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> , which then complex with co-smad <dig>  enter the nucleus and associate with transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors to regulate the expression of target genes.

tgf-β plays a dual role in angiogenesis by orchestrating a switch from vascular inhibition to pro-angiogenic activity . in particular, there is evidence that tgf-β <dig> induced angiogenesis acts with vegf to mediate apoptosis of excessive vascular sprouts and may even be required for initial sprouting from an existing vascular network  <cit> . the nature of the angiogenic response to tgf-β depends on the balance of alk <dig> versus alk <dig> signaling input, with alk <dig> predominantly promoting sprouting and alk <dig> favoring the resolution/stabilization phase of angiogenesis  <cit> . thus, tgf-β is either pro- or anti-angiogenic, depending on which tgf-rii/smad pathway is engaged  <cit> . differences also exist in the kinetics and dose responses of these pathways: alk <dig> mediated signaling is transient and maximal at low concentrations of ligand while alk <dig> mediated signaling is sustained and maximal at higher doses of ligand  <cit> . increased expression of endoglin led to inhibition of tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling  in a dose dependent fashion  <cit> .

activation of vascular sprouting during angiogenesis entails the specification of endothelial cells into tip and stalk cells. endothelial tip cells are mainly migratory and polarized with minimal proliferation while stalk cells proliferate throughout sprout establishment and form the nascent vascular lumen cells  <cit> . the delta-like ligand  <dig> -notch <dig> signaling pathway is involved in tip-stalk cell identity  <cit> . tip cells express high levels of dll <dig> and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- <dig> , and have low levels of notch signaling activity  <cit> . the specification of endothelial cells as tip or stalk cells is transient and its reversibility is contingent on the balance between pro-angiogenic factors. here we quantify the effect of tgf-β <dig> on in vitro angiogenesis using a matrigel cord formation assay, and determine the impact of this angiogenic cytokine on expression of molecules associated with endothelial tip and stalk cell identity.

methods
cells and culture conditions
primary bovine aortic endothelial cells  were isolated and characterized as described  <cit>  and used between passage  <dig> and  <dig>  cultures were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium  with 10% fetal bovine serum  and 1 mm sodium pyruvate  at 37 °c in 5% co <dig> and 95% atmospheric air. confluent monolayers were serum starved 16 h prior to treatment.

tgf-β <dig> dose-response
serum starved baec were treated with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  ng/ml of recombinant human  tgf-β <dig>  in serum free dmem for up to 24 h, ± 5 μm sb- <dig> . cell supernatant  was collected and centrifuged at  <dig> × g for 4 min, and adherent cells lysed for protein or rna analysis. for some assays, conditioned medium was subjected to additional ultracentrifugation  prior to western blotting.

protein isolation and western blotting
cells were lysed on ice with cell lysis buffer  supplemented with 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail  <dig> , 2 μg/ml aprotinin  and 1 mm pmsf . total protein was quantified using the bio-rad system and electrophoresis was performed with 20–30 μg protein plus β-mercaptoethanol; samples were heated prior to sds-page electrophoresis. proteins were transferred to pvdf membrane, blocked in 5% skim milk or 5% bsa for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °c. the antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal anti-adam  <dig>  and goat polyclonal anti-adam  <dig> ; both santa cruz biotechnology; rabbit monoclonal anti-endoglin , anti-notch <dig> , anti-vegfr <dig> , anti-pvegfr <dig> tyr  <dig> , rabbit polyclonal anti-hsp <dig>  and anti-psmad <dig> , mouse monoclonal anti-smad <dig> , all from cell signaling; rabbit polyclonal anti-dll <dig>  and anti-mmp- <dig> , rabbit monoclonal anti-vegfr <dig> , all from abcam; anti-α tubulin . membranes were washed and incubated with a secondary antibody  for 30 min at room temperature. bands were visualized with luminata classico or luminata forte western hrp substrate  and membranes imaged using a chemidoc mp imaging system . protein loading was normalized by stripping and re-probing for α-tubulin, followed by densitometry analysis.

rna isolation and gene expression analysis
cells were lysed in ribozol  and rna isolated using aurum total rna columns  according to manufacturers’ protocols. rna was reverse-transcribed with 4 μl iscript  before amplification using primers for target and housekeeping genes . ssofast evagreen supermix  was used to determine primer efficiency and for quantitative pcr. no-template controls and quantitative pcr reactions were run in triplicate with an initial 2 min denaturation at 95 °c, 40 cycles of 95 °c for 5 s, 60 °c for 5 s, followed by melt curve analysis of 65 °c to 95 °c in  <dig>  °c increments on the cfx <dig> realtime system . full length and soluble splice variant mrna for vegfr <dig> were first normalized to both hprt and gapdh housekeeping genes, and then results from tgf-β1-treated samples were expressed as relative amounts normalized to control  samples. data were analyzed using cfx manager .table  <dig> sequences of primers used for qpcr

matrigel cord formation assay
the impact of tgf-β <dig> and inhibitors on in vitro angiogenesis was determined by cord formation assay. 10 μl of growth factor containing bd matrigel matrix  was added to each well of cold angiogenesis μ-slides  and allowed to gel at 37 °c for 30 min. 50 μl of baec cell suspension containing  <dig> ×  <dig> cells in media- <dig> made with complete supplements  plus or minus tgf-β <dig> and inhibitors were added to each well. slides were incubated for 8 h at 37 °c, and one image/well was captured with phase contrast microscopy using a 4x objective. the generation of cord networks was quantified using the tube formation assay analysis service wimtube ; analyzed parameters were total cord length, # of branching points, and # of loops. # of tip cells was also determined by manual count of phase contrast images; tip cells were defined as free-ended cells/sprouts with visible filopodia.

statistical analysis
all statistical analysis and graphing were performed using graphpad prism  <dig> software . means for at least three biological replicates were calculated and plotted with standard error bars. data were analyzed by using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis test followed by dunn’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, as appropriate. differences between means were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than  <dig> . assays were performed in triplicate unless otherwise indicated.

RESULTS
exogenous tgf-β <dig> induced a dose-dependent decrease in endothelial cord formation on matrigel, with significant reductions in cord length, cord branching, loop formation and tip cell generation detectable with doses of tgf-β1 ≥  <dig>  ng/ml . western blotting of whole cell lysates from baec treated with exogenous tgf-β <dig> under serum free conditions confirmed our previous findings  <cit>  of significant downregulation of vegfr <dig>  and no alteration in vegfr <dig> expression . vegfr <dig> was detected as a doublet, with one band approximately 230 kda , and a smaller  putative ‘immature’ isoform  <cit> . reduction in cell associated vegfr <dig> protein was seen in both mature and immature forms, and was sustained for at least 24 h after removal of exogenous tgf-β <dig> . there was also significant reduction in the levels of notch <dig> but no changes in its ligand dll <dig> . tgf-β <dig> induced a profound upregulation of the type iii receptor endoglin  and concomitant activation of smad <dig> signaling, as revealed by enhanced levels of phosphorylated smad <dig>  . smad <dig> activation was maximal at  <dig>  ng/ml tgf-β <dig>  thus subsequent assays were performed with this concentration.fig.  <dig> tgf-β <dig> induced dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cord formation. a representative phase contrast images showing endothelial cell cord formation 8 h after plating on matrigel™ in the presence of exogenous tgf-β <dig> . note higher magnification control panel , showing tip cells  and loop of endothelial cords . wimtube automated quantification of cord formation showed that tgf-β <dig> significantly inhibits total cord length , cord branching , formation of loops , and generation of tip cells . tgf-β <dig> doses of  <dig>  ng/ml or higher significantly inhibited cord formation compared to control  or  <dig>  ng/ml. **p ≤  <dig> ; **p ≤  <dig> ; n = 4; kruskal-wallis test. scale bars = 300 μm

the mechanisms of the observed changes in angiogenic signaling pathways were then investigated. as demonstrated by treatment with the alk <dig> signaling inhibitor sb- <dig> , blockade of alk <dig> signaling significantly eliminated the ability of  <dig>  ng/ml tgf-β <dig> to inhibit matrigel angiogenesis . sb inhibitor alone had no significant effect compared to dmso vehicle  in these assays. exogenous tgf-β <dig> led to a reduction in vegfr <dig> phosphorylation  and expression levels, but addition of the sb inhibitor rescued vegfr <dig> signaling . similar results were obtained using sd- <dig>  another alk <dig> signaling inhibitor . tgf-β <dig> activation of smad <dig> phosphorylation and endoglin upregulation was also blocked by sb . notch <dig> levels showed a trend towards significant differences with sb inhibitor , but expression of dll <dig> was not altered . smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation was also not altered in these samples. thus, alk <dig> appeared to mediate the effects of tgf-β <dig> on the observed altered angiogenesis signaling pathways.fig.  <dig> tgf-β <dig> induced reduction in endothelial cord formation occurs via an alk <dig> related pathway. a representative phase contrast images showing endothelial cell cord formation 8 h after plating on matrigel™ under control conditions , 5 μm sb- <dig>  in dmso , 5 ng/ml exogenous tgf-β <dig>  or  <dig>  ng/ml tgf-β <dig> plus 5 μm sb- <dig> . b wimtube automated quantification of cord formation showed sb inhibitor significantly blocked the ability of  <dig>  ng/ml tgf-β <dig> to significantly inhibit total cord length, cord branching, formation of loops, and generation of tip cells. sb inhibitor, either alone or in combination with  <dig>  ng/ml tgf-β <dig> was not significantly different from dmso control. **p ≤  <dig> ; ***p ≤  <dig> ; n = 4; kruskal-wallis test

the basis of vegfr <dig> downregulation was further investigated. loss of vegfr <dig> from whole cell lysates of tgf-β <dig> treated baec was accompanied by concomitant increasing levels of full-length protein in serum free conditioned media  collected from the same cells . qpcr analysis showed that both full-length and the soluble vegfr <dig>  splice variant mrnas were expressed by these cells, with the full-length isoform being the predominant species, expressed approximately  <dig> fold higher than the svegfr <dig> message. both isoforms of vegfr <dig> message were significantly downregulated in tgf-β <dig> treated cells compared to control. however, the ratio of full-length to soluble vegfr <dig> mrna was not altered by  <dig>  ng/ml tgf-β <dig> treatment , supporting the finding from fig. 5a that a truncated soluble form of vegfr <dig> protein is not released from these cells upon tgf- β <dig> exposure.fig.  <dig> tgf-β <dig> reduces vegfr <dig> expression via multiple mechanisms. a western blot showing tgf-β <dig> induced loss of cell associated vegfr <dig> protein and concomitant increase in full-length vegfr <dig> detected in conditioned medium. b quantitative pcr analysis showed that there was no change in the relative ratio of full length vegfr <dig> mrna to alternative spliced svegfr <dig> mrna upon tgf-β <dig> treatment. c tgf-β <dig> treatment induced increased expression of adam family sheddase enzyme adam  <dig>  tgf-β <dig> treatment had no effect on the expression of adam  <dig> or the membrane-associated metalloproteinase mmp- <dig>  d ultracentrifugation of endothelial conditioned medium demonstrated that soluble vegfr <dig> is associated with the extracellular vesicle/exosome marker hsp <dig> in tgf-β <dig> treated cells




no change in mmp- <dig>  or adam <dig> protein levels were detected, and adam <dig> was weakly upregulated in tgf-β <dig> treated cells, suggesting enzymatic shedding was not the mechanism for increased cm-associated vegfr <dig> . in contrast, increased levels of the extracellular vesicle/exosome-associated protein hsp <dig> were also detected in serum-free conditioned medium from tgf-β <dig> treated cells . these data suggest that in addition to transcriptional downregulation, full-length vegfr <dig> is released from tgf-β <dig> treated endothelial cells as a mechanism to regulate angiogenesis.

discussion
tgf-β <dig> induced a dose dependent inhibition of endothelial cord formation and modulation of endothelial angiogenic receptor expression in an alk <dig> dependent fashion. we observed enhanced endoglin expression, and reduced notch <dig> and vegfr <dig> expression, which collectively abrogated tip cell formation and stalk elongation. during sprouting angiogenesis, combined increased vegfr <dig> and reduced notch <dig> signaling lead to gain tip cell phenotype, and increased notch <dig> signaling promotes loss of tip cell phenotype  <cit> . our results suggest that tgf-β <dig> interferes with tip/stalk cell identity when alk5/smad <dig> signaling pathways are activated.

tgf-β-mediated alk <dig> signaling serves to enhance sprouting angiogenesis in part by indirectly inhibiting tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling  <cit> . endoglin modulates the balance between alk <dig> and alk <dig> signaling, favouring a pro-angiogenic phenotype  <cit> . however, in our study, endoglin expression was highest in cells treated with ‘anti-angiogenic’ levels of tgf-β <dig> , which were also associated with alk5/smad <dig> activation. interestingly, activated  smad1/ <dig> was readily detected independent of tgf-β <dig> treatment. thus, in our system, tip cell identity may be the default phenotype, which is repressed upon activation of alk5/smad <dig> signaling, possibly via loss of notch  <dig> and vegfr <dig> expression.

we saw concomitant loss of cell-associated full-length vegfr <dig> and increased levels of cm-associated full-length vegfr <dig> upon tgf-β <dig> exposure. endothelial cells are known to produce an alternatively spliced vegfr <dig> mrna, leading to transcripts lacking the transmembrane domain coded for by exon  <dig>  <cit> . this transcript codes for a soluble form of the receptor , which could potentially account for the presence of cm-associated vegfr <dig> in our samples. however, while both full length and alternatively spliced vegfr <dig> transcripts were detectable in baec, the full length vegfr <dig> mrna was by far the predominant isoform, and we found no evidence for a preferential shift in production of message for svegfr <dig> in tgf-β <dig> treated cells. further, the cm-associated vegfr <dig> was full-length protein as assessed by estimated molecular mass. thus, the source of vegfr <dig> found in conditioned medium is unlikely to be due to preferential translation of a svegfr <dig> variant mrna upon exposure to tgf-β <dig> 

alternatively, vegfr <dig> could be cleaved from the baec cell surface through proteolytic activity. the matrix metalloproteinase mmp- <dig>  is known to cleave the tgf-β type iii receptor endoglin from endothelial cells, generating a soluble form  <cit> . in our study, levels of mmp- <dig> were weakly detectable by western blotting, and qpcr revealed cq values >  <dig> . this, combined with the lack of detectable soluble endoglin in baec conditioned medium, suggests that mmp- <dig> cleavage of surface protein is not a significant determinant of cm-associated vegfr <dig> in our system. a disintegrin and metalloprotease  family of enzymes act as ‘sheddases’, cleaving surface bound proteins to general soluble isoforms. adam- <dig> is known to shed vegfr <dig> from endothelial  <cit>  and non-endothelial  <cit>  cell surfaces, and vegfr <dig> is a target of adam- <dig> mediated cleavage in endothelial cells  <cit> . both adam- <dig> and adam- <dig> were produced by baecs, and there was weak induction of adam- <dig> by tgf-β <dig> in our cells. however, such sheddase activity would generate cm-associated vegfr <dig> molecules of ~130 kda  <cit> , but we only detected full length  vegfr <dig> in conditioned medium, consistent with an alternative mechanism for release of this receptor from endothelial cells. recent reports suggest that prolonged surface residence of vegfr <dig> in huvecs leads to protease-mediated cleavage and the generation of a soluble fragment of ~100 kda and a residual cell associated 130 kda fragment  <cit> . as well, enhanced ubiquitination of vegfr <dig> upon internalization in huvecs leads to endosome-lysosome pathway mediated fragmentation into  <dig> and 120 kda fragments  <cit> . the absence of such vegfr <dig> fragments in our samples suggests that tgf-β <dig> is not modulating vegfr <dig> levels via these mechanisms in these baecs.

there is growing evidence that vegfr <dig> signals cells in an ‘autocrine’ or ‘intracrine’ fashion, leading to increased receptor activity within the cytosolic  and/or nuclear compartments . endothelial cells can also release exosomes containing sequestered molecules that then modulate neighbouring cells . endothelial cells expressing high levels of endoglin also upregulate autophagy  <cit> . autophagy may enhance extracellular vesicle/exosome release via the mutivesicular body pathway, especially in serum starved endothelial cells  <cit> . these pathways may also be relevant for tip/stalk cell specification during sprouting angiogenesis, as tips cells display enhanced vegfr <dig> turnover via endocytosis and transfer from early endosomes to multivesicular bodies  <cit> . further, dll <dig> containing exosomes can be shed from endothelial cells, and dll <dig> containing exosomes modulate tip cell phenotype during sprouting angiogenesis  <cit> .

in agreement with the aforementioned findings, our results extend this activity to include the possibility that shedding of vegfr <dig> containing extracellular vesicles  by vascular endothelium may be enhanced upon exposure to tgf-β <dig>  we detected full length vegfr <dig> in serum free conditioned medium along with the exosome marker hsp <dig>  retinal pigment epithelial cells also shed exosomes containing vegfr <dig> which subsequently modulate endothelial cord formation in vitro  <cit> , but to our knowledge this is the first report that vegfr <dig> might be shed from endothelial cells themselves.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report that tgf-β <dig> alters levels of key angiogenic receptors, and interferes with tip/stalk cell identity when alk5/smad <dig> signaling pathways are activated. our results suggest that downregulation of surface vegfr <dig> and concomitant increase in vegfr <dig> levels in endothelial cell conditioned medium may be a direct response to alk5-mediated tgf-β signaling. exosome shedding of vegfr <dig> may rapidly limit the effects of angiogenic stimuli on the cells and stop further sprout formation, but the role of these events in physiological and pathological angiogenesis requires further investigation.
