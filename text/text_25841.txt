BACKGROUND
calorie restriction , defined as a reduction of caloric intake with adequate nutrition, ameliorates common diseases of aging, such as insulin resistance, type  <dig> diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer  <cit> . cr is effective in extending lifespan in most every organism examined to date, including yeast, drosophila, and several mammalian species  <cit> . the mechanism underlying these beneficial effects is not well understood and elucidation of the molecular signaling pathways downstream of cr might enable pharmacological intervention into this pathway  <cit> .

silent information regulator  <dig>  was first identified as a mediator of cr-induced lifespan extension in yeast  <cit> and subsequently has been shown to regulate this process in lower metazoans, such as drosophila melanogaster and c. elegans  <cit> . the mammalian ortholog of sir <dig>  sirt <dig>  is an nad+-dependent protein deacetylase that catalyzes the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues in substrate proteins. sirt <dig> deacetylates a number of cellular proteins including p <dig>  foxo, pgc-1Î±, and lxr  <cit> . following a regimen of cr in both rodents and in humans, sirt <dig> expression levels are increased  <cit> . sirt <dig> belongs to the sirtuin family that consists of seven enzymes that share a conserved core catalytic domain but differ in their flanking amino- and carboxy-terminal sequences, cellular localization, tissue distribution, and substrate proteins  <cit> . increasing evidence implicates mammalian sirtuins as regulators of cr-induced physiological responses, including lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, stress responses and insulin secretion  <cit> .

as potential mediators of cr in vivo, the sirtuin enzymes may represent novel intervention points for developing therapeutics to treat diseases of aging such as type  <dig> diabetes. in particular, sirt <dig> activators have been described and these show promise in improving metabolic profiles in both genetic and diet induced obese rodents. the first sirt <dig> activator described, resveratrol, is a polyphenolic compound found in red wine. resveratrol is a micromolar activator of sirt <dig> in vitro and has been shown to improve the metabolic profile of mice fed a high fat diet  <cit> . in this model of type  <dig> diabetes resveratrol increases mitochondrial biogenesis and ameliorates insulin resistance.

recently, we reported novel small molecule activators of sirt <dig> that are  <dig> times more potent than resveratrol  <cit> . these compounds are structurally distinct from resveratrol but act through the same enzymatic mechanism, binding to an allosteric site exposed in the enzyme-substrate complex and thereby lowering the km of sirt <dig> for its acetylated peptide substrates. most notably, these molecules exhibit good oral bioavailability in rodents and like resveratrol, improve both glucose and insulin homeostasis in ob/ob mice, diet induced obese mice, and zucker fa/fa rats.

in this report we characterize the early molecular signaling events that are shared between treatment with two structurally distinct sirt <dig> activating compounds, srt <dig>  a proprietary formulation of resveratrol with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties and improved oral bioavailability, and srt <dig>  a chemically distinct compound with nanomolar potency toward sirt <dig>  <cit> . using a causal network modeling  approach empowered by transcriptional profiling data from mice treated with the sirt <dig> activators and a global knowledgebase, we determined that srt <dig> and srt <dig> recapitulate a molecular signature which overlaps with that of cr. furthermore, we characterize several key hypotheses underlying the cr network for sirt <dig> activator mechanism of action, and show that metabolism mediated by ppar family members is upregulated, mitochondrial biogenesis is enhanced, and pro-inflammatory signaling is decreased. in addition, both srt <dig> and srt <dig> show significant overlap in the signaling pathways they modulate supporting the concept that these structurally distinct compounds act on the same molecular target, sirt <dig>  in vivo. finally, we provide complementary in vivo and in vitro evidence that supports the hypothesis that sirt <dig> activation in vivo by small molecules mimics calorie restriction.

RESULTS
small molecule activators of sirt <dig> improve metabolic parameters in several rodent models of t2dm. to elucidate the pathways downstream of sirt <dig> activation responsible for the observed efficacy in these in vivo models, we performed causal network modeling  of gene expression data from livers of mice fed a high fat diet  and treated with sirt <dig> activators, srt <dig>  or srt <dig>  for three days . both compounds exhibit good oral bioavailability in mice.

cnm utilizes a species-specific knowledge assembly model derived from a global knowledgebase  as the substrate for automated reverse causal analysis powered by gene expression changes  from the experiment under analysis  <cit> . automated reverse causal analysis generates a list of statistically significant upstream explanations, or hypotheses, for changes in rna expression in response to sirt <dig> activator treatment. these hypotheses are subsequently evaluated for biological integrity and experimental relevance and assembled into causal biological networks. automated reverse causal analysis identified  <dig> statistically significant hypotheses that could explain the changes in gene expression observed in the livers of dio mice treated with srt <dig> for  <dig> days versus controls . three key pathways, comprised of  <dig> of the  <dig> hypotheses are the focus of this report: 1) calorie restriction-resveratrol treatment, 2) increased metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis and 3) decreased pro-inflammatory signaling. these pathways were chosen because to date, they have been validated by in vitro and in vivo experimental data. initially, we characterized the molecular pathways induced by srt <dig> and in order to determine if the mechanisms identified for srt <dig> treatment were congruous with srt <dig> treatment, the directionality of the individual expression changes supporting the hypotheses identified from srt <dig> treatment were compared to those observed after srt <dig> treatment using a statistical comparison at the probe set level. finally, the results of our modeling efforts were confirmed by in vitro and in vivo experimental data.

statistical analysis of the microarray data identified  <dig> genes whose rna expression was significantly modulated in response to srt <dig> treatment. while all molecular state changes can be mapped to the knowledgebase, only the subset of these changes that have one or more upstream causal assertions in the knowledgebase are considered causally modeled. if there is no information in the knowledgebase for the transcriptional control of a given gene, then it is not possible to identify hypotheses that can explain this state change. in the case of the srt <dig> dataset, 78%  of the state changes were causally modeled. the high percentage of modeled state changes indicates that the knowledgebase is sufficiently enriched with causal information about the experimental outcome to be competent for reverse causal analysis.

srt <dig> and srt <dig> generate a gene expression profile similar to that of calorie restriction
one of the strongest hypotheses generated from reverse causal analysis on the srt <dig> dataset comparison is cr, supported by  <dig> independent changes in gene expression, corresponding to ~20% of the causally modeled state changes . reverse causal analysis on the srt <dig> dataset comparison identified two processes downstream from srt <dig> treatment that are supported by causal networks of statistically significant hypotheses: the increased metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis network and the decreased inflammation network . together, these two networks along with the cr and resveratrol treatment hypotheses  make up the larger cr network for sirt <dig> activator mechanism of action. to determine whether the cr hypothesis was also supported in the srt <dig> dataset comparison, we analyzed the  <dig> probe sets mapping to the  <dig> state changes underlying the cr hypothesis. importantly, all  <dig> probe sets were modulated in the same direction in the srt <dig> and srt <dig> dataset comparisons  suggesting that these two structurally distinct sirt <dig> activators act via the same mechanism in vivo. these findings support the hypothesis that srt <dig>  like srt <dig>  induces a gene expression profile similar to cr.

notably, resveratrol treatment was identified as a statistically significant hypothesis supported by  <dig> state changes . the resveratrol treatment hypothesis is supported by data encoded into the knowledgebase from prior studies demonstrating that this compound recapitulates many of the metabolic benefits of cr in rodent models of obesity and insulin resistance  <cit> . as with the cr hypothesis, analysis of the state changes underlying the resveratrol treatment hypothesis determined that probe sets mapping to these state changes were modulated in the same direction after srt <dig> treatment compared to srt <dig> treatment .

in vivo efficacy data for srt <dig> and srt <dig> in multiple rodent models for t2dm also agree with the cr network shown in figure  <dig>  where these compounds exhibit similar effects to calorie restriction. we recently reported that these sirt <dig> activators, like calorie restriction, improve glucose and insulin homeostasis in three models of t2dm: a c57bl/ <dig> mouse diet-induced-obesity model, an ob/ob mouse model and a zucker fa/fa model  <cit> . figure  <dig> demonstrates efficacy of these two compounds in the diet-induced obesity model using c57bl/ <dig> mice. after  <dig> weeks of dosing mice with srt <dig>  and srt <dig> , fasted blood glucose is decreased by 24% and 20% in srt <dig> and srt <dig> treatment groups respectively compared to vehicle control animals. similarly, fed insulin levels are decreased by ~60% and ~50% respectively in animals dosed with srt <dig>  or srt <dig>  compared to vehicle control animals. these data are consistent with our previously reported findings that srt <dig> and srt <dig> improve glucose and insulin homeostasis in rodent models of t2dm  <cit> .

srt <dig> and srt <dig> increase metabolic signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis
the hypotheses supporting the increased metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis network downstream of srt <dig> treatment are displayed in figure  <dig>  one key hypothesis supporting this process is increased transcriptional activity of ppargc1Î±  which is supported by  <dig> state changes. several reports have demonstrated that deacetylation of ppargc1Î± by sirt <dig> at multiple lysine residues leads to increased transcriptional activity of ppargc1Î± towards its target genes . furthermore, ppargc1Î± is known to function as a coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors, such as ppar Î±,Î³,Î´ and esrrÎ± , all of which are predicted to have increased transcriptional activities in the srt <dig> dataset comparison with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> supporting state changes respectively . ppargc1Î±, pparÎ± and pparÎ³ also have reported roles in transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . the increased metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis network in figure  <dig> also includes increased transcriptional activity of esrrÎ± which can upregulate mitochondrial respiration genes  <cit> . finally, nrip <dig>  is a known transcriptional repressor of genes involved mitochondrial biogenesis and a corepressor of esrrÎ± and pparÎ±, and the reduced transcriptional activity of nrip <dig> hypothesis is supported by  <dig> state changes .

to determine if the hypotheses underlying the increased metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis network are supported in the srt <dig> dataset comparison, we examined the probe sets for the state changes supporting the increased transcriptional activity of pparÎ± ) and increased transcriptional activity of ppargc1Î± ) hypotheses to determine whether their directionality upon srt <dig> treatment was conserved. increased taof is the most statistically significant hypothesis in figure  <dig>  supported by  <dig> state changes and all  <dig> probe sets mapping to these  <dig> state changes in the srt <dig> dataset comparison are modulated in the same direction after srt <dig> treatment . similarly, for the  <dig> state changes supporting increased taof in the srt <dig> dataset comparison, we determined that all  <dig> probes mapping to these state changes were modulated in the same direction after srt <dig> treatment . finally, we observed conserved directionality between the srt <dig> and srt <dig> dataset comparisons for the state changes supporting increased taof, increased taof, increased taof and decreased taof . taken together these data suggest that srt <dig>  like srt <dig>  increases transcriptional activities of ppargc1Î± and the other ppar family members. ultimately, these molecular signaling events contribute, at least in part, to efficacy of srt <dig> and srt <dig> in improving glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in animal models of t2dm .

although, figure  <dig> predicts activation of ppar family members as a molecular signaling component downstream of sirt <dig> activation, neither srt <dig> nor srt <dig> recapitulates key pharmacological activities of known ppar agonists, fibrates  and thiazolidinediones . in animals dosed with srt <dig> or srt <dig>  there were no increases in molecular markers of peroxisomes in liver nor were there increases in liver mass , as one would observe in animals treated with the fibrate class of drugs. there also were no observed side-effects indicative of thiazolidinedione treatment, such as edema, increased adipocyte proliferation and increased body weight . thus, while small molecule activation of sirt <dig> impinges on ppar activation at the molecular signaling level, srt <dig> and srt <dig> are pharmacologically distinct from both fibrates and thiazolidinediones.

in order to further validate the predicted increase in mitochondrial biogenesis upon srt <dig> treatment, which is also activated in response to srt <dig> treatment, we performed a number of in vitro and in vivo studies. it has been previously shown that resveratrol  <cit>  and srt <dig>  <cit>  increases citrate synthase activity, an enzymatic marker for mitochondrial content, in skeletal muscle of mice treated with these compounds. to demonstrate that these sirt <dig> activators can directly increase mitochondrial content in a cell based model, we measured cs activity in c2c <dig> myotubes treated with vehicle, srt <dig> or srt <dig> for  <dig> hours. as shown in figure  <dig>  both srt <dig>  and srt <dig>  induced statistically significant increases in cs activity, suggesting increased mitochondrial content in these cells. finally, we measured atp, an indirect marker for mitochondrial energy output, in nci-h <dig> cells treated with srt <dig>  or srt <dig>  for  <dig> hours. figure  <dig> demonstrates that both srt <dig> and srt <dig> increase atp levels with statistical significance compared to vehicle. in conclusion, these data, combined with previous reports on resveratrol and srt <dig>  strongly support the network shown in figure  <dig>  in which small molecule activators of sirt <dig> increase mitochondrial biogenesis.

srt <dig> and srt <dig> blunt inflammatory signaling pathways
another well characterized hallmark of cr is decreased inflammation  <cit> . tnfÎ± and egf are known inducers of nf-Îºb complex transcriptional activity, and nr3c <dig>  represses nf-Îºb complex-induced transcription by a direct binding event as well through indirect mechanisms such as transactivation of the iÎºb gene . reverse causal analysis identified these inflammatory mediators as statistically significant hypotheses after srt <dig> treatment. figure  <dig> depicts the decreased inflammation network with the following support: decreased tnfÎ± protein abundance , decreased egf protein abundance , decreased transcriptional activity of the nf-Îºb complex  and increased transcriptional activity of nr3c <dig> . in this model, decreased nf-Îºb complex transcriptional activity is supported by decreased tnfÎ± and egf abundance, as well as increased nr3c <dig> activity. in order to determine whether the state changes consistent with decreased inflammatory signaling were observed in the srt <dig> dataset comparison, we examined the  <dig> probe sets that map to the  <dig> state changes supporting the decreased taof hypothesis and determined that  <dig> of  <dig> probe sets were modulated in the same direction between the srt <dig> and srt <dig> dataset comparisons . similar analyses were performed for the other three hypotheses in figure  <dig> , supplementary data), and it was determined that in each case, the underlying changes in gene expression were consistently modulated in the same direction.

next, we examined whether srt <dig> and srt <dig> could affect inflammatory signaling in an in vitro cell based model, lps-induced tnfÎ± secretion in raw <dig>  macrophages. cells were pre-incubated with compounds at the indicated doses for  <dig> hour and then were treated with  <dig> ng/ml lps for an additional hour. tnfÎ± concentrations in cell supernatants were then measured by elisa. figure  <dig> shows that srt <dig>  and srt <dig>  inhibit tnfÎ± secretion by ~50% and ~40% respectively. taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that srt <dig> and srt <dig> inhibit inflammation and are consistent with prior reports suggesting that sirt <dig> may inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways  <cit> .

discussion
we have previously described the identification and characterization of small molecule activators of sirt <dig>  these compounds increase sirt <dig> enzymatic activity by lowering the km of sirt <dig> for its acetylated substrates. importantly, these drug-like molecules are efficacious in improving glucose and insulin homeostasis in multiple animal models of insulin resistance and t2dm  <cit> . in the present study, we characterize the early molecular signaling mechanisms potentially underlying the therapeutic efficacy of sirt <dig> activation by small molecules in a diet induced obesity model. to this end we employed a combination of causal network modeling of transcriptional profiling data and supporting in vivo and in vitro data.

reverse causal analysis identified cr as a statistically significant hypothesis in the srt <dig> dataset comparison. to determine whether this hypothesis is also supported in the srt <dig> dataset comparison, we analyzed the underlying state changes at the probe set level. in doing so we determined that all  <dig> probe sets covering  <dig> changes in gene expression displayed conserved directionality between the two dataset comparisons . hence, these two chemically distinct small molecule activators of sirt <dig> recapitulate many of the molecular events of calorie restriction in vivo and importantly work via the same molecular mechanism in vivo â sirt <dig> activation, a conclusion which is supported previous studies which have shown that srt501-resveratrol and srt <dig> increase the deacetylation of sirt <dig> substrates  in vivo and in vitro. additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that srt <dig> <cit>  and srt <dig> <cit> , like calorie restriction  <cit> , enhance oxidative metabolism, protect against diet induced obesity, increase exercise endurance, and improve glucose and insulin homeostasis in rodent models of metabolic disease. these findings are consistent with the role of sirt <dig> downstream of calorie restriction, which, as a therapeutic strategy, has proven efficacious in improving the metabolic profiles in rodents, large mammals, monkeys and humans  <cit> .

reverse causal analysis also identified increased metabolism, mediated primarily by transcriptional activation of ppar family members, as a network supported by six statistically significant hypotheses in the srt <dig> dataset comparison. furthermore, we determined that the changes in gene expression which support these hypotheses are modulated in the same direction in the srt <dig> and srt <dig> treatment groups. ppar-mediated signaling is a well documented molecular event downstream of calorie restriction  <cit> . these nuclear hormone receptors regulate a multitude of physiological pathways including lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, inflammation and development  <cit> . notably, pparÎ± and pparÎ³ are respectively the molecular targets of the fibrate and thiazolidinedione  classes of drugs  <cit> . fibrates are commonly used for therapeutic intervention of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and dyslipidemia. tzds, on-the-other-hand, are insulin-sensitizing reagents frequently used in the treatment of t2dm and metabolic syndrome. it is important to note that, while reverse causal analysis identified ppar activation as a hypothesis downstream of small molecule activation of sirt <dig>  we did not observe the full range of pharmacological effects associated with fibrate or tzd treatment, such as increased peroxisome mass, body weight gain, increased adipocyte proliferation and edema. we speculate that the levels of ppar activation and/or the subset of upregulated ppara gene-targets generated by treatment with srt <dig> or srt <dig> are likely more consistent with those observed downstream of calorie restriction.

the exact mechanism by which srt <dig> and srt <dig> increase transcriptional activation of ppars is an area for future investigation. however, it is likely due, at least in part, to deacetylation and transcriptional activation of ppargc1Î±, a phenomenon supported by transcriptional data in this study. ppargc1Î± has been well characterized as a co-activator for numerous nuclear hormone receptors including ppars  <cit> . also, ppargc1Î± is known to be deacetylated at multiple lysine residues by sirt <dig>  leading to increased ppargc1Î± transcriptional activity  <cit> .

importantly, the effect of sirt <dig> activation on ppar activity is likely tissue-specific and family member-specific. for example, previous work in rodents has demonstrated that sirt <dig> represses pparÎ³ mediated transcription, leading to increased fat mobilization and inhibition of adipogenesis  <cit> . future studies may elucidate whether ppar activation in tissues other than liver is important for the efficacy of sirt <dig> activating compounds and what the relative contribution of specific ppar family members is in a tissue-specific context.

closely linked to the increased metabolism and ppar family activity is increased mitochondrial biogenesis, a phenomenon strongly associated with cr  <cit> . the key node of this network is transcriptional activation of ppargc1Î±, which, as mentioned previously, is deacetylated by sirt <dig>  leading to increased transcriptional activity of ppargc1Î±  <cit> . this network is also supported by the increased transcriptional activities of pparÎ±, pparÎ³ and essrÎ± and by decreased transcriptional activity of nrip <dig>  pparÎ±, pparÎ³ and essrÎ± can be coactivated by ppargc1Î±, leading to increased expression of target genes, many of which are involved in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis  <cit> . conversely, nrip <dig>  acts a transcriptional co-repressor of several nuclear hormone receptors, including esrrÎ±, leading to decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> .

within the context of the liver, the increased mitochondrial biogenesis may contribute to an improved metabolic profile via increased efficiency in fatty acid oxidation and lowering of serum triglycerides, both of which have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues  <cit> . furthermore, it is certainly plausible that increased mitochondrial biogenesis in other tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, also contributes to therapeutic efficacy of sirt <dig> activating compounds. in fact, previous reports have indicated that both resveratrol and srt <dig> increase mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle  <cit> . this increase in mitochondrial capacity allows for efficient substrate switching between lipids, during times of fasting, and carbohydrates in response to insulin  <cit> . moreover, mitochondrial oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle has been shown to be a strong predictor of insulin sensitivity in humans  <cit> .

finally, srt <dig> and srt <dig> mimic calorie restriction as demonstrated by the hypotheses consistent with decreased inflammation. as previously mentioned, calorie restriction is well known to inhibit inflammatory processes. this hypothesis is based upon decreases in signaling of tnfÎ±, egf and nf-Îºb complex and upon increased transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor, nr3c <dig>  tnfÎ± is a well characterized inflammatory cytokine and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancer, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome  <cit> . similarly, the nf-Îºb complex, which lies downstream of the tnfÎ± signaling cascade, is a transcriptional complex, which regulates the transcription of wide variety of target genes including inflammatory signaling factors, such as tnfÎ±  <cit> . egf also has an established role in inflammatory signaling, most notably implicated as a fibrogenic factor underlying the pathogenesis of copd, cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular disease  <cit> . finally, the glucocorticoid receptor nr3c <dig> is a central regulator of inflammatory responses, capable of transcriptionally repressing pro-inflammatory genes and of transcriptionally activating anti-inflammatory genes . in summary, the predicted decrease in inflammation is comprised of a combination of upregulation of anti-inflammatory pathways and downregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways. elucidation of the exact mechanism by which sirt <dig> activation leads to these events will be an area for future investigation.

notably, this network is supported by in vitro data, which demonstrates that both srt <dig> and srt <dig> induce dose-dependent inhibition of lps-stimulated tnfÎ± secretion in a cultured macrophage cell line. also, several prior reports have implicated sirt <dig>  <cit>  and resveratrol  <cit>  as negative regulators of inflammation both in vitro and in vivo.

the decreased inflammation network supports the calorie restriction model, as cr has been shown to inhibit inflammation in multiple animal models, including humans. whether this decreased inflammation contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of our sirt <dig> activating compounds remains under investigation. certainly, there is increasing evidence that the development of insulin resistance in obese individuals involves paracrine interplay between white adipose tissue and infiltrating macrophages. at the molecular level, this pathogenic progression is characterized by an increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as tnfÎ±, il- <dig> and mcp- <dig>  and a decrease of anti-inflammatory adipokines, such as adiponectin . exacerbation of this pathogenic inflammatory response to include tissues such as the liver and vasculature can ultimately contribute to the onset of t2dm and/or metabolic syndrome. it has been reported that the anti-inflammatory effects of tzds, mediated through pparÎ³, are essential for the therapeutic efficacy of that drug class in treating t2dm  <cit> . hence, it is quite plausible that sirt <dig> activating compounds improve glucose and insulin homeostasis, in part, by inhibiting inflammatory signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our modeling effort provides evidence that sirt <dig> activating compounds mimic many of the benefits of calorie restriction in vivo. these compounds increase metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, primarily through transcriptional activation of ppargc1Î± and ppar family members. additionally, these molecules decrease inflammatory signaling, which could theoretically improve cytokine and adipokine profiles and reduce macrophage burden in key target tissues. the total effect of such phenomena could result in increased insulin sensitivity in multiple tissues, including liver, muscle and fat. additionally, these compounds enhance glucose homeostasis and abrogate the diabetic phenotype in multiple animal models of t2dm. although calorie restriction has been characterized as an effective strategy in the treatment of diseases of aging, such as t2dm, it is logistically very difficult to adhere to such a regimen due to the hunger and pleasure drives for food intake. hence, we speculate that sirt <dig> activating compounds, currently in clinical trials for multiple indications, could be a promising alternative to cr in combating these diseases.
