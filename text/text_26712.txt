BACKGROUND
carotenoids are a diverse class of c <dig> isoprenoids that have multiple physiological and nutritional functions in many organisms. carotenoids have received considerable attention from the food industry, medicine and cosmetics because of their interesting pigment properties, and more importantly, their potential beneficial effects on human health. lycopene is an effective antioxidant  <cit>  and has beneficial biological and pharmaceutical activities, including anti-cancer  <cit> , anti-inflammatory  <cit> , and antioxidative activities  <cit> . lycopene is widely used as a supplement in functional foods, animal feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals and as an additive in cosmetics.

potential commercial applications mean that efficient biotechnological production of lycopene has become increasingly necessary, and a number of reports have described its production using metabolic engineering  <cit> . however, all of these above studies focused on the deletion of undesirable genes and plasmid overexpression of key genes. such plasmid-based expression systems have several drawbacks, including structural instability, segregational instability or allele segregation  <cit> . these plasmid instabilities cause genetic instability, which reduces the production of the compound of interest. tyo et al. reported that plasmid-carrying strains lost poly-3-hydroxybutyrate  productivity after  <dig> generations with antibiotics  <cit> . moreover, antibiotic resistance genes are the most commonly used markers for selecting and maintaining plasmids in hosts during cultivation. however, antibiotics are both costly and banned from food and pharmaceutical production processes. there is also a potential risk of the spread of antibiotic-resistant marker to other microbes in nature, leading to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms   <cit> .

these drawbacks of using plasmids can be overcome by integration of genes into the chromosome. recently, tyo et al. developed a plasmid-free method for the over-production of metabolites that can achieve high copy numbers of the desired genes, termed chemically induced chromosomal evolution   <cit> . genes of interest were inserted into chromosome of escherichia coli by the λinch genomic integration method, and then evolved to the desired gene copy number by chemical induction. however, the λinch genomic integration protocol is complicated and time-consuming, because it contains three steps that involve two recombination steps. chiang et al. modified the conditional-replication, integration, and modular plasmid system produced by haldimann and wanner  <cit> , and developed a replicon-free and markerless method  for the chromosomal insertion of genes  <cit> . genes of interest can be directly integrated into the bacterial attachment site of the e. coli chromosome as single copies, through transformation. however, the ciche strains reported by tyo et al. still have an antibiotic resistance marker   <cit> . to avoid the use of antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotics, goh and good developed a novel system using the widely used the biocide triclosan as the selective agent and the essential growth gene fabi of e. coli as the selective marker  <cit> . thus, to overcome the drawbacks of ciche as originally developed by tyo et al., we developed a series of integration expression vectors, pxkf3t5b, for triclosan induction chromosomal evolution in our previous paper  <cit> . using these vectors, genes of interest can be inserted into e. coli site-specifically by transformation using rmm. the gene copy number can then be evolved to the desired value by triclosan induction. in this study, we constructed a lycopene hyper-producer e. coli that does not carry plasmid or antibiotic marker, using the ciche integration expression vector. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of metabolic engineering of an e. coli that does not carry a plasmid or antibiotic marker using a multiple gene expression system for lycopene production.

RESULTS
ciche of e. coli for lycopene production
to overcome the drawbacks of ciche as originally devised by tyo et al., we developed a series of integration expression vectors, pxkf3t5b, for triclosan induction chromosomal evolution in our previous paper  <cit> . using these vectors, genes of interest can be inserted into e. coli site-specifically by transformation using rmm. the gene copy number can then be evolved to the desired value by triclosan induction. thus, strains constructed using our ciche integration expression vectors have no antibiotic resistance and are environmentally safe.

the ciche integration expression vector containing the lycopene biosynthetic gene cluster  was transferred into e. coli bw <dig>  and then increasing triclosan concentration was used to induce ciche. figure  <dig> shows the results of lycopene production in ciche strains resistant to different triclosan concentrations. lycopene production in ciche strains increases with increasing triclosan concentration during chromosomal evolution. the maximum lycopene production of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g dry cell weight  was obtained by the ciche strains resistant to  <dig> μm triclosan cultured in 2yt medium. figure  <dig> shows that the crti gene copy number of the ciche strains increases with triclosan concentration during chromosomal evolution. at a triclosan concentration of  <dig> μm, the copy number reached about  <dig> in the ciche strains, which is the equivalent copy number of a medium to high copy plasmid. when the triclosan concentration was above  <dig> μm, the gene copy number still increased; however, the lycopene production of the ciche strains did not increase. the results indicated that there is an optimal copy number of the crt genes for efficient production of lycopene. thus, the reca gene of the ciche strain that was resistant to  <dig> μm triclosan was deleted to obtain e. coli cbw <dig>  in which homologous recombination, which could reduce the copy number, is inhibited. the crt gene number of the reca-deleted strain did not change . the genetic stability was also assayed . the level of lycopene production in e. coli cbw <dig> remained constant after  <dig> rounds of subculturing without triclosan. however, the plasmid-bearing strain e. coli bw <dig>  lost lycopene productivity sharply, whether cultured with antibiotics or not. with antibiotics, the level of lycopene production in the plasmid-bearing strain, e. coli bw <dig> , was only about 30% of that of the parent strain after  <dig> rounds of subculturing. without antibiotics, the lycopene productivity of the plasmid-bearing strain e. coli bw <dig>  dropped to zero after  <dig> rounds of subculturing. these results are consistent with previous reports wherein the gene copy number and phb production of a ciche strain remained constant after  <dig> rounds of subculturing  <cit> . they also found that phb productivity of the plasmid-carrying strain cultured with antibiotics was completely lost after  <dig> generations. the loss of productivity in the plasmid system with antibiotics may be due to allele segregation. it is likely to occur regularly, despite antibiotic selection, particularly in subculturing experiments or in chemostats  <cit> .

a cells were cultured in sbmsn medium supplemented with  <dig> g/l kac without triclosan at 37°c for  <dig> h. data represent means of triplicate cultures ± standard deviation.

optimization of the lycopene synthetic pathway
overexpression of the idi, dxs, pck, pps, rpos, appy, yjid, ycgw, wrba and atpe genes are reported to improve lycopene production in e. coli <cit> . thus, the effects of over-expression of these genes in e. coli cbw <dig> on lycopene production were investigated. the results are presented in table  <dig>  surprisingly, only the over-expression of appy slightly enhanced the specific lycopene content. this may reflect the different genetic backgrounds of the strains. in e. coli cbw <dig>  isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is overexpressed by chromosomal evolution of ipihpi. thus, overexpression of the idi gene in e. coli cbw <dig> was not beneficial to lycopene production. zhao et al.  <cit>  reported that the dxs gene from bacillus subtilis functioned more efficiently to enhance isoprene production in e. coli than the native dxs gene. however, overexpression of the dxs gene from bacillus subtilis significantly inhibited lycopene production in e. coli cbw <dig>  possibly because the t <dig> promoter has replaced the native promoter of the dxs gene in e. coli cbw <dig>

to reduce the metabolic burden caused by the plasmid, the native promoter of the appy gene was replaced with the t <dig> promoter to obtain e. coli cbw <dig> . as shown in table  <dig>  the replacement improved cell growth and lycopene concentration. kang et al. used a shotgun approach and found that overexpression of the appy gene improved lycopene production  <cit> . the appy gene encodes a transcriptional activator of two regulator energy metabolism operons, hya and cbdab-appa, which are induced by anaerobiosis. they reasoned that the appy gene might help rescue the strain from energy insufficiency caused by lower ubiquinone levels.

a comparative transcriptome and proteome analysis demonstrated that the deletion of the transcriptional repressor iclr of the glyoxylate pathway increased lycopene production  <cit> . thus, we deleted the iclr gene and examined lycopene production. the deletion of the iclr gene in e. coli cbw <dig> caused a slight inhibition of growth and did not affect the specific lycopene content. the deletion of the iclr gene in the promoter replacement strain, e. coli cbw <dig> , slightly improved specific lycopene content, from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g dcw to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/gdcw, and improved the lycopene concentration from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l . in the iclr gene knockout strain, the glyoxylate pathway is constitutively active  <cit> . furthermore, there are other examples of metabolic engineering involving deleting iclr to increase productions of compounds. sanchez et al. successfully knocked out iclr to boost the glyoxylate pathway flux for succinate overproduction  <cit> . lee et al. observed aceba upregulation in the threonine-overproducing e. coli, and when iclr deleted, a 30% higher threonine production was recorded  <cit> .

many reports have been published about lycopene production using recombinant e. coli <cit> . however, these strains contain plasmids, which can cause genetic instability and can have a negative environmental impact. chiang et al.  <cit>  constructed a lycopene hyper-producer e. coli strain that did not carry the replicon or a selective marker using rmm. however, rmm is a single gene copy expression system. tyo et al.  <cit>  constructed a lycopene producer e. coli using ciche, a plasmid-free, high gene copy expression system. however, this strain still contained a chloramphenicol resistance marker. in the present study, we engineered a lycopene producer e. coli that does not carry a plasmid or an antibiotic marker. the ciche strain only contains the fab i gene, which is essential for the growth of e. coli. the strain does not present the safety problems associated with antibiotic resistance genes in plasmids. moreover, the strain does not require the presence of the resistance compound  during the fermentation process. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of engineering an e. coli that does not carry a plasmid or antibiotic marker using a high gene copy expression system.

the maximum specific lycopene content  of e. coli cbw <dig>  was higher than that of the ciche strain reported by tyo et al.   <cit> . the value was also higher than other plasmid-carrying strains, which achieved  <dig> mg/g dcw  <cit> ,  <dig> mg/g dcw  <cit>  or  <dig> mg/g dcw produced by the engineered e. coli containing heterologous lycopene and mevalonate pathways  <cit> . however, the yield is slightly lower than that reported by chiang et al.   <cit> . in their study, the rmm strain e. coli bl21-crtd1k has an additional chromosomal copy of dxs fused to the t <dig> promoter. however, plasmid-based overexpression of the dxs gene in the ciche strain did not further enhance lycopene production. moreover, e. coli cbw <dig>  containing an additional chromosomal copy of the dxs gene, produced lycopene at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/gdcw, which was lower than e. coli cbw <dig>  .

although the yield of our engineered e. coli harboring only a heterologous lycopene pathway achieved the advanced levels quoted in the literature, many papers have reported that the introduction of a heterologous mevalonate pathway improved production of isoprenoids such as lycopene  <cit> , coq <dig> <cit> , α-farnesene  <cit> , terpenoid  <cit> , taxol  <cit>  and amorphadiene  <cit> . thus, integration of a heterologous mevalonate pathway into the chromosome of the engineered e. coli cbw <dig>  may further improve lycopene production.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a lycopene producer e. coli strain that does not carry a plasmid or antibiotic marker using ciche, replacement of a promoter as well as knockout of a gene. no resistance compound was required during the fermentation process using this strain. this is the first report of engineering an e. coli that lacks a plasmid and an antibiotic marker using a high gene copy expression system. the engineered strain remained stable, as determined by its lycopene production, after  <dig> sequential transfers.
