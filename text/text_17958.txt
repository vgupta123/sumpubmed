BACKGROUND
rapeseed  is one of the most important oil crops in the world. the annual planting acreage is about  <dig> mh in china, which accounts for a quarter of the world's total rapeseed production. over the past  <dig> years, with the rape cultivar upgrades, china's rapeseed production has experienced tremendous advancement. the substantial improvement in yield and quality has greatly expanded the cultivation area and improved production efficiency in china.

before  <dig>  almost all rapeseed cultivars in china were high in erucic acid and glucosinolate levels . zhongyou  <dig>  dominated rapeseed planting along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river at that time, with an annual planting area of around  <dig>  mh in the late 1980s and early 1990s. with intense breeding toward high oil content and double low quality , zhongshuang  <dig> , bred using zy <dig> as one of the crossing parents, was released in  <dig>  due to better comprehensive agronomic characteristics, zs <dig> has rapidly replaced zy <dig> and become one of the most popular double-low rapeseed cultivars in china. from  <dig> to  <dig>  the total planting acreage of zs <dig> was in excess of  <dig>  mh. zs <dig> is characterized by a  <dig> % higher oil content,  <dig> % higher oleic acid content,  <dig> % lower erucic acid content and  <dig> % lower eicosenoic acid content than zy <dig> . the double high cultivar zy <dig> and the double low cultivar zs <dig> have been two of the most popular rapeseed cultivars in china, representing two generations of chinese rapeseed cultivars and reflecting the major achievements in rapeseed quality improvement over the past  <dig> years.

*means different character, **means larger different character.

significant improvements in oil quality must be accompanied by changes in gene activities involving fatty acid biosynthesis in developing seeds. the elucidation of gene transcription patterns associated with a specific stage of seed development is critical for understanding the molecular and biochemical events related to oilseed quality improvement. characterization of these genes and their regulatory elements would provide not only new genetic information for understanding b. napus seed development, but also alternative seed promoters for controlling gene expression in developing seeds. liu et al. analyzed the proteomic pattern and the gene transcripts of early germs with high-oil content and normal inbred lines in maize and found that three enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, namely, putative enoyl-acp reductase , putative stearoyl-acp desaturase  and putative acetyl-coa carboxylase , had more abundant expression in high-oil lines than in the normal lines  <cit> . high expression of sad, enr and accase was associated with increasing oil concentration in high-oil maize. dong et al. described the tissue-specific expression of  <dig> highly expressed mrnas during early stages of seed development in b. napus and found that the majority of the seed-specific genes that are expressed at early stages of seed development encoded proteins with high similarity to hypothetical arabidopsis proteins  <cit> . genes in various metabolic and storage pathways exhibit distinct timing patterns, indicating that different sets of transcriptional factors turn on oil and protein pathway genes  <cit> . knowledge of the expression of multiple genes and their regulation during oil biosynthesis is needed to further understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling oil metabolism  <cit> . this understanding will aid in the development of suitable tools for altering seed development and seed quality traits by molecular genetics.

rapeseed seed quality in china has been drastically improved under selective pressure against fatty acid composition and oil content, but no reports have been made on the associated changes in related gene activities. in this study, we investigate how the transcriptional profiles of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis respond to the selective pressures against oil content and fatty acid composition and how the genes coordinate with each other. our results provide a first glimpse of the gene expression and regulation breeding response to selective pressures in rapeseed, which is critical to metabolic engineering and the quality improvement of oilseeds.

RESULTS
seed development and fatty acid accumulation patterns
during the first few weeks of seed development, the seed coat expanded until the seed was almost full size. at this stage, the seed was somewhat translucent and resembled a water-filled balloon. it was difficult to dissect ovules from the pod at  <dig> dap but it became possible after  <dig> dap. the seed's embryo now began development and grew rapidly within the seed coat to fill the space previously occupied by fluid. the mature seed was harvested at  <dig> dap.

in the zs <dig> cultivar, the total fatty acid content continued to increase and peaked at about  <dig> dap, followed by a gentle drop with seed maturation . in contrast, zy <dig> showed a similar pattern of accumulation of total fatty acids except that it had higher levels at  <dig> dap . nine fatty acids were found in zy <dig>  but only five in zs <dig> . among the five common fatty acids, only oleic acid  showed different accumulation patterns , whereas the other fatty acids accumulated in similar patterns in both cultivars . in zs <dig>  the oleic acid content increased continuously and became a major component at the end , whereas in zy <dig>  oleic acid ascended in the early stages  but decreased from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap and then remained constant until the end . the initial content of all saturated fatty acids  was relatively high but decreased from  <dig> dap and reached a minimum at about 25– <dig> dap, ultimately comprising a minor proportion of the fatty acids in mature seeds . the content of c18: <dig> was as high as 35–42% during the initial stages  and decreased continuously to a final content of about 20% . the c18: <dig> content fluctuated from 6% to  <dig> % and was fixed at about 7% in mature seeds .

relative transcript levels for the  <dig> genes
different genes had different transcript levels but with very similar tendencies between the two cultivars in general . in both cultivars, zy <dig> and zs <dig>  the top  <dig> genes, including napin, oleosin, β-ct, caleosin, β-actin, fae <dig> and cruciferin, accounted for over 95% of the transcript levels from the  <dig> genes . the genes coding for storage proteins alone accounted for 87%, of which the napin transcript was 77~78% of the total, oleosin 6~8%, and caleosin and cruciferin about 1~2%. for other non-storage protein genes, β-ct, gapdh, fae <dig> and sad showed relatively higher transcript levels and accounted for 11% of the total transcripts . the other  <dig> genes accounted for only about 3% of the total transcripts, of which aapt <dig>  kas <dig>  mcat, fatb, suc <dig> and α-ct had the lowest transcript levels .

tl means mean transcript level, c.v. of tl means coefficient of variation of transcript level, and rtl means relative value of the transcript levels, dap means days after pollination, or days between the pollination and the transcript peak occuring.

comparison of the mean transcript levels between zy <dig> and zs9
for most of the genes investigated, the transcript levels changed with time during seed development . comparison of the mean transcript levels of zs <dig> and zy <dig> revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  were upregulated by 20% to 109%, whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  were downregulated by between 20% and 50% .

among the upregulated genes, fad <dig>  accase and fae <dig> were the most remarkable. during 20– <dig> daps, the transcripts of fad <dig> were 130~180% more abundant in zs <dig> than in zy <dig> . in zy <dig> the accase transcript stayed stable at low levels, whereas in zs <dig> it displayed high and low peaks at 25– <dig> daps and  <dig> dap, about  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold the levels in zy <dig>  respectively . fae <dig> gene transcripts were 150%–480% more abundant in zs <dig> than in zy <dig> during 15– <dig> daps. at  <dig> dap, more than 4-fold higher fae <dig> transcript levels were observed in zs <dig> than in zy <dig> . caleosin and gktp transcripts were more abundant only during the final stage of seed development .

among the downregulated genes, kas <dig> showed significantly lower expression at  <dig> and  <dig> daps , fata at 10– <dig> daps , bcrk <dig> and p <dig> at  <dig> dap , β-ct at 20– <dig> daps  and oleosin at 40– <dig> daps .

comparison of the zy <dig> and zs <dig> transcript peak levels
the value and time of a transcript's peak levels are an indication of gene activity and regulation. zy <dig> and zs <dig> had different peak values and times for the expression of many of the genes investigated. the peak value was 338%, 288% and 162% higher in zs <dig> than in zy <dig> for fad <dig>  accase and gktp, respectively , and 40–60% higher in zs <dig> than in zy <dig> for kas <dig>  mcat, agpase, pepc, kacd, fae <dig>  caleosin, kas <dig> and gapdh . the peak value was over 60% lower for aapt <dig> and 20–40% lower for oleosin, kas <dig>  fata, bcrk <dig>  sad and p <dig> in zs <dig> than in zy <dig> .

according to the peak time of gene expression, the  <dig> genes can be clustered into  <dig> groups. in zs <dig>   <dig> genes  peaked at  <dig> or  <dig> daps,  <dig> genes  at 20– <dig> daps,  <dig> genes  at 30– <dig> daps and  <dig> genes  at 40– <dig> daps. in zy <dig>   <dig> genes  peaked at  <dig> or  <dig> daps,  <dig> genes  at 20– <dig> daps,  <dig> genes  at 20– <dig> daps, and  <dig> genes  at 40– <dig> daps. in most cases, the difference in peak times between the two cultivars was no more than  <dig> days, but lpaat and agpase peaked  <dig> days later in zs <dig> than in zy <dig>  whereas suc <dig> and napin peaked  <dig> days earlier.

comparison of gene expression patterns between zy <dig> and zs9
different genes showed different degrees of variation in their transcript levels over the course of seed development, as shown by the variation coefficients in table  <dig>  in zy <dig>  aapt <dig>  oleosin, cruciferin, napinb, caleosin, fae <dig>  p <dig> and kas <dig> had relatively higher variation, whereas in zs <dig>  cruciferin, napinb, p <dig>  gktp, caleosin, oleosin, bcrk <dig> and suc <dig> did. β-actin had the lowest variation in both cultivars, serving as a satisfactory control gene in this study.

the  <dig> genes can be divided into five groups according to their expression patterns.

the first group is characterized by a basic transcript level at the initiation of seed formation, a rapid rise to a peak at 35– <dig> dap, and then by a gradual decline. the genes for storage proteins, such as napin, caleosin, cruciferin, and oleosin, possessed this pattern . the expression patterns of these genes were much like the accumulation pattern of the total fatty acids, c18: <dig> in zs <dig>  and c22: <dig> in zy <dig> .

the second group is characterized by a bell-shape transcript curve, with a moderate level of expression at the initial stage followed by a gradual increase in transcripts at the middle stage and a decline to the initial level at the final stage. the genes sad, fad <dig>  fad <dig>  kas <dig>  agpase, mcat and fae <dig> possessed this pattern . these enzymes may function in fatty acid synthesis. the accumulation of the fatty acids c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> in zy <dig>  also fell into such a pattern.

the third group is characterized by a low transcript level at the beginning, followed by further decreasing expression throughout seed development, as exhibited by fad <dig>  fata, fatb, α-ct, bc, pepc, kcr <dig>  and kacd . the fatty acids c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c20: <dig>  and c22: <dig>  which are minor components in mature seeds once synthesized in early seed development, also showed such a pattern .

the fourth group is characterized by a stable expression or a gently rise and fall in expression pattern. gktp, accase, kas <dig>  dgat <dig> and β-actin are included in this group . the fatty acid α-c18: <dig> had a similar pattern to this group . the fifth group is characterized by a high level of expression at the initiation of seed development, peaking at  <dig> or  <dig> dap, followed by an abrupt decline, as exhibited by β-ct, bcrk <dig>  kas <dig>  aapt <dig>  suc <dig> and p <dig> .

a comparison of zs <dig> and zy <dig> indicated that most of the genes displayed similar expression patterns, although a few of the genes, such as accase, fae <dig> and gktp, had obvious differences between zy <dig> and zs <dig> . accase had a bell-shape expression pattern in zs <dig>  putting it in the second group, whereas it had a flat pattern in zy <dig>  putting it in the third group . fae <dig> was in the first group of expression pattern in zy <dig> but had a bell-shape pattern in zs <dig>  putting it in the second group . gktp also showed a significant difference, with a significant rise in transcript levels at the mature stage of seed development in zs <dig>  placing it in third group, although it had a very low level throughout all stages of seed development in zy <dig> .

correlation between fatty acid accumulation and gene expression
correlation analysis was performed between transcript profiles of the genes and accumulation patterns of the fatty acids. the results showed that the two cultivars had different correlation patterns . for the low erucic acid rapeseed  zs <dig>  the total amount of fatty acids was highly correlated with caleosin and correlated with cruciferin and oleosin; the amount of c16: <dig> was highly correlated with bc, pepc and fad <dig> and correlated with oleosin, α-ct, kas <dig>  β-ct, bcrk <dig>  suc <dig>  dgat <dig>  fata, p <dig>  fatb, aapt <dig>  and kcr2; c18: <dig> was highly correlated with suc <dig>  β-ct, bc, pepc, fad <dig>  fata, p <dig>  fatb, and aapt <dig>  positively correlated with kcr <dig>  dgat <dig>  kas <dig>  bcrk <dig>  kas <dig>  and α-ct, and negatively correlated with oleosin; c18: <dig> was highly negatively correlated with bc, fad <dig> and pepc, negatively correlated with aapt <dig>  fatb, suc <dig>  p <dig>  β-ct, fata, kcr <dig>  bcrk <dig>  kas <dig>  dgat <dig>  α-ct, and kas <dig> and positively correlated with caleosin and oleosin; c18: <dig> was highly positively correlated with bc, fatb, aapt <dig>  fad <dig>  suc <dig>  pepc, p <dig> and kcr <dig> and correlated with β-ct, fata, bcrk <dig>  kas <dig>  dgat <dig> and α-ct; c18: <dig> was highly positively correlated with accase and correlated with fad <dig>  for high erucic acid rapeseed  zy <dig>  the total amount of fatty acids was highly negatively correlated with kcr <dig>  negatively correlated with accase and positively correlated with fae <dig>  c16: <dig> was highly positively correlated with kcr <dig>  positively correlated with agpase, pepc, fad <dig>  accase, fata, gktp, lpaat, and fatb and negatively correlated with fae1; no significant correlation for c18: <dig> was found with any gene; c18: <dig> was highly positively correlated with kcr <dig> and highly negatively correlated with fae <dig>  positively correlated with fatb, accase, and pepc and negatively correlated with caleosin; c18: <dig> was correlated only with fad3; c20: <dig> was highly positively correlated with kcr <dig> and correlated with agpase, accase, and gktp; c20: <dig> was highly positively correlated with fae <dig>  highly negatively correlated with kcr <dig> and negatively correlated with pepc; c22: <dig> was highly positively correlated with caleosin and cruciferin, highly negatively correlated with kas <dig>  bc, kcr <dig> and β-ct, positively correlated with napin, oleosin, and fae <dig>  and negatively correlated with kacd, fad <dig>  fata, fatb, and lpaat.

discussion
many efforts by plant breeders have focused on strategies to enhance both the quantity and the quality of seed storage reserves and, more recently, molecular genetics approaches have been used to modify seed components. the biochemical pathways that produce these different storage components are largely known  <cit> , but the factors that determine the relative proportions of the different storage components are not well understood. this study has provided a new data set describing the patterns of expression of  <dig> rapeseed genes during storage product accumulation in seed development and characterizing the response of gene expression to quality improvement in rapeseed.

the present study indicated that the expression levels of specific genes changed with the selection pressures when zs <dig> and zy <dig> were compared. seven of the  <dig> genes  were upregulated by 30% to 109%, whereas  <dig> genes  were down-regulated 50%–30% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  these changes may come from selection pressures or from genetic drift during breeding.

genes studied
lipid synthesis depends on the correct spatial and temporal activity of many gene products  <cit> . these genes execute their function in three stages: fatty acid synthesis in the plastid, triacylglycerol  synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum  and assembly into an oil body  <cit> .

the first fatty acid synthesis stage commences with accase, catalyzing the carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa  <cit> . most plants have two forms of accase, the homomeric form in the cytosol, composed of a single large polypeptide catalyzing the individual carboxylation reactions  <cit> , and the heteromeric form in plastids, composed of four subunits, including biotin carboxylase   <cit> , biotin carboxyl carrier protein   <cit> , α-carboxyltransferase   <cit>  and β-carboxyltransferase   <cit> .

the next enzyme is mcat , which catalyzes the transfer of malonyl-coa to the holo acyl carrier protein , generating malonyl-acp  <cit> . beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii  catalyzes the subsequent condensation and transacylation of acetyl-coa with malonyl-acp  <cit> . kas <dig> catalyzes the subsequent condensation from c4- to c14-acp in the plastid  <cit> , and kas <dig> elongates 16:0-acp to 18:0-acp in the plastid  <cit> .

the synthesized 18:0-acp is converted to oleic acid  by sad  <cit> . in hear cultivars such as zy <dig>  the oleic acids  continue the elongation process to synthesize c20- to c22- fatty acids such as erucic acid , which involves four enzymatic steps: condensation by 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase   <cit> , reduction by 3-ketoacyl-coa reductase   <cit> , dehydration by 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratase   <cit>  and finally reduction by trans- <dig> -enoyl-coa reductase. in lear cultivars, such as zs <dig>  fatty acids do not elongate any more due to the disfunction of fae <dig>  <cit> .

oleic acid  can be further desaturated to oleate acids  by fad <dig>  <cit>  and fad <dig>  <cit>  in the cytosol and the plastid, respectively. cytosolic and plastid ω- <dig> desaturations that result in the production of linolenic acids  are controlled by fad <dig>  <cit>  and fad <dig>  <cit> , respectively.

the final step in the plastid is the release of fatty acids from acp by thioesterase, resulting in the formation of dissociated fatty acids  <cit> . two distinct but related thioesterase gene classes exist in higher plants. fata is an acyl specificity 18:1>>18:0>>16: <dig> thioesterase  <cit> . in contrast, fatb, encoding thioesterases, has a specificity for 16:0>18:1>18: <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . fatty acids are exported to the cytosol and activated to their acyl-coa derivatives.

in the following stage, fatty acids are incorporated into glycerolipids through the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate by acyltransferases, producing tag. de novo phosphatidic acid biosynthesis in plants occurs in three steps: first, the acylation of the sn- <dig> position of glycerol-3-phosphate gives rise to lysophosphatidic acid, which is catalyzed by glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase   <cit> ; second, the acylation of the sn- <dig> position forms phosphatidic acid, which is catalyzed by a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase   <cit> . diacylglycerol acyltransferase  catalyzes the final step of the tag synthesis pathway  <cit> .

the tag assembles with oil body proteins to form oil bodies. there are four predominant seed storage proteins: cruciferin, caleosin, oleosin and napin. cruciferin is a high molecular weight neutral complex of 12s proteins, composed of six subunit pairs  <cit> . napin is a low molecular weight basic  <dig> s protein, composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains  <cit> . caleosin is a ca2+-binding oil-body surface protein  <cit>  playing a role in both the normal modification of storage vacuole membranes and the interaction of oil bodies with vacuoles  <cit> . oleosins are oil body-associated proteins that cover and stabilize oil bodies during tag accumulation  <cit> .

relative transcript levels of genes in the developing seed
according to delisle and crouch  <cit> , mrna is about 1% of the total rna in b. napus embryos. cruciferin and napin represent  <dig> and 8%, respectively, of embryonic mrna based on mass  <cit> . cruciferin and napin constitute 20% and 60% of the total protein content of mature seeds, respectively  <cit> . moreover, napin  is about  <dig> fold smaller in mass  than cruciferin   <cit> . all of this implies that napin mrna is the most abundant and is much higher in copy number than cruciferin mrna during rapeseed development, in agreement with our results. with the strongest expression in seed, the napin promoter has been popularly used for genetic engineering of seed components.

no estimate of the relative mrna abundance has been reported for oleosin and caleosin in b. napus thus far, but it has been reported that oleosins are low molecular weight  alkaline proteins that represent about 2–8% of the total seed proteins  <cit> , and caleosins are present at relatively low levels and are mainly bound to microsomal membrane fractions  <cit> . our data are the first on the relative abundance of oleosin and caleosin transcripts in rapeseed development, indicating that oleosin transcripts are the second most abundant in copy number after napin among the  <dig> storage proteins .

no significant difference was found in the relative abundance of seed mrna between zy <dig> and zs <dig>  indicating that the genes are expressed in a highly organized and coordinated way and in a stable molar amount during seed development.

upregulated genes 
pepc, upregulated by 39% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  is an enzyme in the family of carboxylyases that catalyzes the addition of co <dig> to phosphoenolpyruvate  to form the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate. seeds of transgenic bean plants expressing corynebacterium glutamicum pepc in a seed-specific manner had a more rapid shift in metabolic fluxes from sugars/starch into organic acids and free amino acids  <cit> , resulting in an accumulation of up to 20% more protein per gram dry seed weight in the transgenic seeds and a 20–30% higher seed dry weight  <cit> . we show that pepc upregulation may result in increased c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18:  <dig> but decreased c18: <dig> .

accase, upregulated by 105% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  is the homomeric accase that catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis, the carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa. targeting a homomeric accase to rapeseed plastids under the control of a seed-specific promoter resulted in higher accase activity and increased oil yield by 3–5% on a dry seed weight basis  <cit> . over-expression of accase in the amyloplasts of potato tubers led to an increase in fatty acid synthesis and a more than 5-fold increase in the amount of tag  <cit> . accase is a key target to increase seed oil by genetic engineering  <cit> . in the present study, increased accase activity was accompanied with increased c18: <dig> in zs <dig> and with increased c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c20: <dig> and c18: <dig> and decreased total fatty acids in zy <dig>  considering that c18: <dig> does not change much with seed development, increased c18: <dig> must be consumed at a similar amount during seed development.

fae <dig>  upregulated by 80% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  is a key gene responsible for fatty acid elongation from 18: <dig> to 22: <dig> or erucic acid biosynthesis in brassica. seed-specific expression in arabidopsis thaliana resulted in up to a 12-fold increase in the proportion of erucic acid. on the other hand, in transgenic high-erucic brassica carinata plants, the proportion of erucic acid was as high as  <dig> % in the best transgenic line, a net increase of 40% compared with wild type  <cit> . fae <dig> mrna was normally transcribed in both hear and lear cultivars but a  <dig> kda protein was found only in hear seeds, whereas it was absent in all lear cultivars using an antibody against fae <dig>  <cit> . it was beyond our expectation that the fae <dig> transcript was more abundant in lear zs <dig> than in hear zy <dig> . the upregulated fae <dig> transcript observed in this study  might be due to synthesized fae <dig> mrna that was not used for the blocked synthesis of functional fae <dig> enzyme.

fad <dig> was upregulated by 109% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  and was significantly correlated only with c18: <dig> in the present study . no significant difference in c18: <dig> content is found during seed development between zy <dig> and zs <dig> . why the fad <dig> transcript level was up-regulated by so much and no more c18: <dig> was found in zs <dig> needs further investigation. it is worthwhile to notice that the fad <dig> and fae <dig> changed coodinately , consistent with previous reports that they are both regulated by abscisic acid   <cit> . some key transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism are under the influence of aba signaling  <cit> . the upregulation of fad <dig> found in this study may be linked through some regulation cofactors with the upregulation of fae <dig> in zs <dig> 

abscisic acid induces oleosin expression  <cit> , and fad <dig> and fae <dig> also are regulated by abscisic acid  <cit> . the upregulation of fad <dig>  fae <dig> and oleosin found in this study might be owing to the same regulation cofactor. the breeding pressure may have selected for the action of this cofactor.

caleosin, one of the storage proteins, was upregulated by 60% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig> . it was significantly correlated with total fatty acids and c18: <dig> in zs <dig> and with c22: <dig> in zy <dig> . meanwhile, transcrips of other storage proteins  were all downregulated. unlike oleosin, caleosin may be involved in signal transduction via calcium binding or phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in processes such as membrane trafficking and lipid-body fusion  <cit> . during germination caleosin plays a role in the degradation of storage lipid in oil bodies  <cit> . upregulation of caleosin implies enhanced oil deposition and improved seed germination in zs <dig> 

gktp , upregulated by 66% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  codes for the precursor of glyoxysomal 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase, the last enzyme in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in plant glyoxysomes. expression of this enzyme is required for the timely onset of natural and dark-induced leaf senescence in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the transcript abundance of gktp is correlated with c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> in zy <dig> but not with any fatty acid in zs <dig>  the reason for this difference is not clear.

gapdh, upregulated by 56% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  encodes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and thus serves to break down glucose for energy and carbon molecules. in addition to this long established metabolic function, gapdh has recently been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation, initiation of apoptosis, and er to golgi vesicle shuttling. in this study, gapdh showed relatively stable and high expression among the non-storage protein genes during seed development. the activity of gapdh was not found to be correlated with any fatty acid biosynthesis in this study .

down-regulated genes 
kas <dig> was down regulated by 51% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig> . it was also found to be significantly correlated with c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> in zs <dig> but not in zy <dig>  katayoon et al. indicated that overexpression of kas <dig> in tobacco plants reduces the rate of lipid synthesis and increases the levels of c16: <dig> in leaves. the transgenic b. napus seeds overexpressing kas <dig> driven by napin also contained lower levels of oil compared with wild-type  <cit> . in addition, the rate of lipid synthesis in transgenic rapeseed seeds was notably slower than that of the wild-type seeds  <cit> . therefore, down-regulation of kas <dig> might result in reduced saturated fatty acids and increased c18: <dig> in zs <dig> . the same situation is also found for p <dig>  fata, fatb, aapt <dig>  kcr <dig>  α-ct, β-ct, bc, suc <dig>  bcrk <dig> and kas <dig> in this study .

fata was downregulated 32% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig> . it was shown in this study that transcript levels of fata were negatively correlated with c18: <dig> in zs <dig> and with c22: <dig> in zy <dig> . in both cultivars, the transcripts of fata peaked at  <dig> or  <dig> daps, and positively correlated with c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> . thioesterases fata and fatb play an essential role in the partitioning of de novo-synthesized fatty acids between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways. fata determines the in vivo levels of c18: <dig> that move out from the plastid  <cit> . downregulated fata means lower levels of c18: <dig> move out from the plastid. this is reasonable because c18: <dig> was not consumed for c22: <dig> in zs <dig>  high accumulation of c18: <dig> must inhibit transcription of fata. similar situations were found for fatb .

as one of the  <dig> subunits of the multisubunit plastidial accase, β-ct was downregulated 36% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  the transcript abundance of β-ct was much higher than other subunits of the multisubunit plastidial accase and ranked the third just next to napin and oleosin in both cultivars . this is probabally because β-ct gene is the only component of plant lipid metabolism known to be encoded by the plastid genome  <cit> . we found downregulation of β-ct was accompanied by increased c18: <dig> in zs <dig> and higher c22: <dig> in zy <dig> , while reduction of the expression of β-ct was reported to result in reduced fatty acid synthesis and even damage of embryo development  <cit> .

bcrk <dig>  downregulated 36% in zs <dig> compared with zy <dig>  is a receptor kinase, catalyzing the key step in steroid perception and signaling in plants  <cit> . this enzyme was active at 10– <dig> dap and was reduced sharply afterward. decreased bcrk <dig> transcripts were significantly accompanied by increased c18: <dig> accumulation in zs <dig> . the reason for the downregulation of bcrk <dig> in zs <dig> observed at  <dig> dap needs further investigation.

cytochrome p <dig> catalyzes a monooxygenase reaction, e.g., insertion of one atom of oxygen into an organic substrate , whereas the other oxygen atom is reduced to water using a plethora of both exogenous and endogenous compounds as substrates for enzymatic reactions, producing a wide cultivar of susceptibility to specific toxins. cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are present in most other tissues of the body and play important roles in hormone synthesis and breakdown , cholesterol synthesis, and vitamin d metabolism. this gene showed significant correlations in zs <dig> but correlations were not found in zy <dig>  the reasons for this difference are not clear.

correlation analysis
most of the genes investigated in this study showed significant correlation with fatty acid accumulation . we found that the correlation of the genes in zs <dig> was significantly different from that in zy <dig>  for example, significant correlation was not found with any fatty acid in zs <dig> but it was found with  <dig> fatty acids in zy821; accase is highly significantly correlated with c18: <dig> in the lear zs <dig> but not in zy <dig>  whereas in zy <dig>  accase showed significant correlation with many other fatty acids, including total fatty acids c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c20: <dig>  and c18: <dig>  exceptionally, in both cultivars fad <dig> showed significant correlation only with c18: <dig>  in accordance with its defined function for the production of c18: <dig> from c18: <dig>  <cit> .

in zs <dig>  more tighter correlations were found between gene transcript levels and fatty acid accumulation patterns. in zs <dig>  thirteen genes including p <dig>  fatb, aapt <dig>  kcr <dig>  dgat <dig>  pepc, fad <dig>  fata, bc, suc <dig>  oleosin, α-ct, and β-ct, whereas only four genes in zy <dig>  i.e., kcr <dig>  fae <dig>  accase and fatb, showed significant correlation with at least four fatty acids, indicating that they play important parts in the storage accumulation of seed development. however, in both cultivars, the genes sad, mcat and fad <dig>  which among the down regulated genes showed no significant correlation with either any fatty acids or the total amount of fatty acids, did not respond to the breeding progress for fatty acid composition in rapeseed.

according to the frequency of significant correlations, kcr <dig> seemed of the highest importance in the fatty acid accumulation process. higher kcr <dig> activity is associated with higher c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  and c18: <dig> in both cultivars, lower c22: <dig> and total fatty acids in zy <dig>  and lower c18: <dig> in zs <dig>  bn-kcr was preferentially expressed in seeds and roots. the co-expression of bn-fae <dig> and bn-kcr observed in the hear cultivar during seed development was different from that of the lear cultivar, suggesting that the expression of both genes was directly or indirectly linked  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first time a close correlation between kcr <dig> and fatty acid accumulation has been shown.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper illustrated the breeding response of the transcription levels of  <dig> genes in developing rapeseed seeds of two cultivars. both cultivars showed similar transcription profiles, with the napin gene transcribed most predominantly. selective pressure toward zero erucic acid, low glucosinolate, high oleic acid and high oil content as well as high yield resulted in both higher fae <dig>  fad <dig>  caleosin, lpaat, kacd, and accase and lower fatb, fad <dig>  suc <dig>  bcrk <dig>  kas <dig>  and mcat expression and in altered correlations between these genes during the storage accumulation of seed development. these results provide insight into the structure of the primary transcriptional networks that coordinate the metabolic responses to seed developmental programs in rapeseed.
