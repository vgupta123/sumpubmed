BACKGROUND
pearl oyster, pinctada fucata, is distributed over the southern coast of china and is the most popular farming shellfish for pearl production. the plain outer surface of pearl oyster shells conceal the lustrous beauty of the mother-of-pearl lining ‘nacre’. it combines a high mechanical strength similar to many ceramics, with elasticity, reducing the brittleness of the shell  <cit> . the nacreous layer of molluskan shells, which consist of highly oriented aragonitic crystals and an organic matrix , is a product of biomineralization .

bone morphogenic proteins  are the largest subgroup in the transforming growth factor-beta  superfamily  <cit>  and play a canonical role in biomineralization  <cit> . in the bmp family, bmp- <dig> has one of the strongest signals for stimulating biomineralization. bmp- <dig> stimulates bone or tooth mineralization via the canonical bmp pathway ; smad  <dig>   <dig>  and presumably  <dig>  propagate bmp signals and are structurally related to mad that acts downstream of dpp, a bmp homolog in drosophila  <cit> . smad <dig> is the only co-smad in mammals  <cit> , and medea acts as a common smad in flies  <cit> . in the cytoplasm, receptor-regulated smads  are directly phosphorylated by bmp-like ligands and then associate with common smads  that are essential to distinct signaling pathways. the heteromeric complexes are translocated to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes in concert with other transcription factors  <cit> .

smads have a domain structure consisting of highly conserved amino - and -terminal regions, referred to as mad homology  <dig>  and mh <dig> domains  <cit> , respectively. the mh <dig> domain can bind to specific dna sequences in the nucleus and the mh <dig> domain is responsible for interaction with other smad proteins  <cit> .

accumulating examples show that bmp orthologs play important roles in biomineralization in mollusca . in previous studies, the bmp- <dig> gene of p. fucata has been identified and defined as pfbmp <dig>  <cit> . further studies showed that a purified recombinant 10-kd mature fragment of pfbmp <dig> could induce osteogenic differentiation in c3h10t1/ <dig>  <cit> , demonstrating that pfbmp <dig> is conserved in terms of its function in the formation of hard tissuepreliminary studies of smad <dig> genes in crassostrea gigas and lingula anatina show their potential involvement in shell formation  <cit> , and luo et al. showed smad4’s involvment in bmp- <dig> signaling based on mollusca and brachiopod genomes  <cit> . although a smad <dig> homolog was found in p. fucata , whether the smad <dig> protein has the same function as their homologs still needs to be tested. in this study, we investigated if pfsmad <dig> played a role in biomineralization. additionally, we identified that pfbmp <dig> could activate the promoter of pfsmad <dig>  and pfsmad <dig> expression decreased after interfering with the expression of pfbmp <dig> 

RESULTS
sequence analysis of pfsmad4
phylogenetic analysis showed that the pfsmad <dig> sequence was most closely related to that of crassostrea gigas, which also belongs to bivalves. the relationships displayed in the phylogenic tree are generally in agreement with those of traditional taxonomy. homology analysis revealed that the whole pfsmad <dig> sequence shared  <dig> – <dig>  % identity to other known smad <dig> sequences, while the mh <dig> domain shared 62– <dig>  % identity and mh <dig> domain shared  <dig> – <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> bioinformatics analysis of pfsmad <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of the smad <dig> family. the phylogenetic tree was constructed by mega  <dig>  using the neighbor-joining method with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the number shown at each branch indicates the bootstrap value . percentages refer to identity values. the left frame showed the identities of the whole pfsmad <dig> sequence with its orthologs. the middle frame: mh <dig> domain; the right frame: mh <dig> domain. these smad <dig> amino acid sequences using in the alignment and phylogenetic analysis are from hssmad <dig> , mmsmad4-a , mmsmad4-b , mmsmad4-c , scsmad4- <dig> , scsmad4- <dig> , cmsmad4-a , drsmad4-a , xlsmad4- <dig> , xlsmad4- <dig> , bfsmad <dig> , sksmad <dig> , spsmad <dig> , cismad <dig> , nvsmad <dig> , aasmad1/ <dig> , dmmedea-a , dmmedea-b , dmmedea-c , cgsmad <dig> , pfsmad <dig> , smsmad <dig> , hrsmad <dig> , mlsmad1/ <dig> , assmad <dig> , tasmad <dig>  and aqsmad <dig> 



pfsmad <dig> expression in tissues and developmental stages
to investigate the expression pattern of pfsmad <dig> among various tissues and developmental stages in pearl oyster, qpcr analysis was performed with gene specific primers. the expression of pfsmad <dig> was abundant in all tissues examined, including ovary, testis, gill, mantle, heart, and digestive. pfsmad <dig> was expressed at particularly high levels in ovaries . high expression levels were also observed in all developmental stages investigated, particularly in the d-shaped larvae .fig.  <dig> expression of pfsmad <dig> mrna in various tissues  and at the developmental stages of pinctada fucata . the mrna levels were quantified by qpcr. the results are expressed as fold-change. each bar represents the mean ± s.e.m 



pfsmad <dig> is localized to the cytoplasm
subcellular localization of pfsmad <dig> was investigated by immunofluorescence assays. the results indicated that pfsmad <dig> was located in the cytoplasm . no fluorescence signal was detected in the control cells detected by the preimmune mouse serum . in an uninduced state, the smads are retained in the cytoplasm . the immunofluorescence assays showed pfsmad <dig> was seen in the cytoplasm of the cells; this tallied with the views above.fig.  <dig> the sub-cellular localization of pfsmad <dig> in hek293t cells. indirect immunofluorescence staining of pfsmad <dig> using mouse anti-myc antibody and fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. preimmune mice serum was used as control , and blue images show the location of the nucleus stained by dapi



knockdown of pfsmad <dig> leads to disorder of the nacreous layer
we tested the function of pfsmad <dig> in biomineralization using rnai technology. the controls were pbs and dsrna-gfp; gfp was not expressed in p. fucata. the pfsmad <dig> dsrna was injected into p. fucata, and qpcr was used to measure expression levels of the pfsmad <dig> gene 7 days after dsrna injection. the pfsmad <dig> expression levels in the pfsmad4-dsrna injected group were suppressed by approximately 70 %, compared with the pbs group . we also observed the inner surface structure of the shells. the surfaces of the shells in the control groups  had a normal well-defined microstructure . the shell surface in pfsmad <dig> dsrna injected groups, stopped regular crystallization and formed a mass without clear boundaries .fig.  <dig> knockdown of the pfsmad <dig> gene by means of rnai. a the expression levels of pfsmad <dig> mrna in the mantle were determined with qpcr 7 days after injection. five oysters were used in each experiment. statistically significant differences were analyzed by means of one-way analysis of variance. asterisk indicates a significant reduction  as compared with pbs-injected oysters. b and c sem images of the surface of the nacreous layer of the oysters injected with pbs and 80 μg of pfsmad <dig> dsrna respectively



knockdown of pfbmp <dig> leads to reduced pfsmad <dig> expression
we then tested whether pfsmad <dig> transduces pfbmp <dig> signals using rnai technology on the pfbmp <dig> gene. the pfbmp <dig> dsrna was injected into the muscle of p. fucata, and qpcr was used to measure expression levels of the pfbmp <dig> and pfsmad <dig> genes. pfbmp <dig> and pfsmad <dig> expression levels of the 80 μg-dsrna injected groups were suppressed by approximately 70 % and 50 %, respectively, compared with the pbs or dsrna-gfp injected groups . incidentally, we also observed the inner surface structure of the shells after dsrna injection using sem. the surfaces of shells in the control groups  were normal . in the pfbmp <dig> dsrna injected groups, the growth of the nacre tablets was disrupted , resembling the nacre pattern after pfsmad <dig> interference. these results further reinforce the concept that bmp <dig> has a function in pearl oyster biomineralization. on the other hand, this tight correlation between the expression of pfbmp <dig> and pfsmad <dig> at the molecular level, and a similar pattern after knockdown, strongly suggested that pfbmp <dig> was the upstream regulation gene of pfsmad <dig> fig.  <dig> knockdown of the pfbmp <dig> gene by means of rnai. a the expression levels of pfbmp <dig> and pfsmad <dig> mrna in the mantle were determined with qpcr 7 days after injection. five oysters were used in each experiment. statistically significant differences were analyzed by means of one-way analysis of variance. asterisk indicates a significant reduction  as compared with pbs-injected oysters. b and c sem images of the surface of the nacreous layer of the oysters injected with pbs and 80 μg of pfbmp dsrna ×  <dig> magnification, respectively



pfbmp <dig> activates pfsmad4-specific reporter genes
a series of 5'-deletion mutants were prepared to determine whether the pfsmad <dig> promoter might harbor cis-regulatory dna sequences critical for transactivation by pfbmp <dig> . each deletion mutant was co-transfected into hek293t cells along with either pcdna <dig> -bmp <dig> or pcdna <dig> .fig.  <dig> pfbmp <dig> activates pfsmad <dig> promoter in hek293t cells. left graph: indicated segments from the 5'-flanking region of the pfsmad <dig> gene linked to pgl <dig> basic encoding luciferase. right graph: the synthetic pfsmad4-luc reporter was transfected into hek293t cells in the absence  or presence of expression vectors for pfbmp <dig>  forty-eight hours after transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity. the bars indicate relative luciferase activity. normalized luciferase activities are shown as the mean ± s.e.m . statistically significant differences were analyzed by means of the student’s t-test. asterisk indicates a significant reduction 



s278luc is the basic promoter of the pfsmad <dig> promoter. deletions of the region from − <dig> to − <dig> resulted in 40-fold increases in promoter activity, suggesting that these regions function as silencers in controlling pfsmad <dig> gene transactivation . over-expression of pcdna <dig>  vector had no obvious effect on the activities of s278luc, s778luc and s1065luc, but when transfected with pcdna <dig> -bmp <dig>  their activity significantly increased . the results presented in this report show that pfbmp <dig>  when expressed in transiently transfected mammalian cells, can activate transcription from the pfsmad <dig> promoter and cis-regulatory dna sequences may exist in the region from − <dig> to − <dig> 

discussion
pfsmad <dig> plays a role in biomineralization
the pfsmad <dig> gene shows high expression in mantle and d-shaped larvae stages. the mantle tissue stage corresponds to shell formation and the d-shaped larval stage is a period in which mineral materials largely accumulate. these results may suggest that pfsmad <dig> exerts a function in shell formation not only in the adult but also during the embryonic stage. high expression level of the smad <dig> gene reported in the shell fields of embryos at different stages in crassostrea gigas  <cit>  is consistent with our study. the high expression in the ovary may indicate that pfsmad <dig> functions in reproduction and development.

it is well known that tgf-β/bmp signaling play important roles in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation  <cit> . as a common mediator smad of tgf-β and bmp signaling, smad <dig> is also required for maintaining normal bone homeostasis. conditional deletion of smad <dig> in osteoblasts leads to lower bone mineral density, decreased bone volume, decreased bone formation rate, and a reduced number of osteoblasts  <cit> . mutations at a single codon in mad homology  <dig> domain of smad <dig> can cause myhre syndrome, which is a developmental disorder characterized by a shortness in stature, hands, feet, and so on  <cit> . interference of pfsmad <dig> caused nacre disorder showed that pfsmad <dig> played a role in biomineralization in p. fucata.

conserved bmp2/smad <dig> signaling pathway in p. fucata
in recent years, many alternatively spliced smad <dig> variants have been found in many species . most isoforms lack one or more in-frame exons, compared with the full-length transcripts, and the activities of their encoded proteins depends on which region of the smad protein is missing or affected  <cit> . comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of pfsmad <dig> with smad <dig> from other organisms showed that pfsmad <dig> has an overall  <dig> – <dig>  % identity with known sequences. the mh <dig> domain and mh <dig> domain showed higher identities, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  % and  <dig> – <dig>  %, respectively. the high identities of the mh <dig> and mh <dig> domains of smads imply a highly conserved structure, further suggesting a conservation in function. the smad <dig> sequence is conserved in eukaryotes from sponges to mammals and the pfsmad <dig> has a high similarity to vertebrate smad <dig>  confirming the hypothesis by westbroek et al.  <cit>  that human and pearl oyster may have homogeneous signal transmitters in biomineralization.

many developmental mechanisms have shown to be conserved throughout evolution  <cit> . gabrielle et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the bmp signaling pathway was in place prior to the divergence in the line of cnidaria to the higher metazoa, and that it has been substantially conservative during evolution. based on mollusca and brachiopod genomes, bmp-smad signaling pathway showed its conservation in verterbrates  <cit> . the conserved smad <dig> was identified in many invertebrates like fly  <cit> , ascidian  <cit>  and amphioxus  <cit> , demonstrating a conserved function in the bmp signalling pathway. rnai technology has been applied in investigating the function of specific genes  <cit>  and it has been used successfully in mollusca . as a potential signal transducing molecule, smad <dig> protein is expected to be co-expressed with the bmp signaling molecule. the interference of pfbmp <dig> mrna led to reduced pfsmad <dig> expression, indicating that pfsmad <dig> could transduce a bmp <dig> signaling pathway. moreover, the nacre pattern after pfsmad <dig> interference bore similar resemblance to that after pfbmp <dig> interference, highlighting an essential role of pfsmad <dig> in mediating the bmp signaling pathway in p. fucata. these results are reinforced by our luciferase assays showing pfbmp <dig> could activate the pfsmad <dig> promoter.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that pfsmad <dig> plays a role in biomineralization and can transduce bmp signals in p. fucata. our data provide important clues about the molecular mechanisms that regulate biomineralization in pearl oyster.
