BACKGROUND
interstitial lung disease  is characterized by interstitial inflammation of the
lung and is frequently associated with collagen diseases, when it is designated
collagen vascular disease-associated ild . cvd-ild is one of the major
manifestations of collagen disease that influence the prognosis  <cit> . acute-onset diffuse ild  occurs in patients with collagen
disease with or without underlying cvd-ild  <cit> . aodild includes acute exacerbation of ild , drug-induced ild
, and pneumocystis pneumonia. the prognosis of aodild is quite
poor. ae-ild is due to collagen diseases per se and characterized by
pathological findings of diffuse alveolar damage overlapping with chronic fibrotic
lung. di-ild occurs frequently in rheumatoid arthritis  patients treated with
methotrexate. pneumocystis pneumonia is defined by the presence of p.
jirovecii organisms in the respiratory tract. however, the classification
of aodild is not established.

the roles of several cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases  and
tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases  were reported in idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis  and in acute respiratory distress syndrome   <cit> . few studies have focused on aodild in collagen diseases. therefore, we
investigated the serum biomarker profile of aodild in collagen diseases in order to
shed light on pathogenesis and markers informative for disease severity or
predicting outcome.

methods
patients and sera
twenty-five patients with collagen diseases :  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years;  <dig> men) were admitted to
sagamihara hospital between  <dig> and  <dig>  because of aodild requiring
corticosteroid pulse therapy. aodild was defined as acute onset and progression
within a month, the presence of clinical symptoms , hypoxia, and computed tomography findings of ild  <cit> . patients with evidence of apparent bacterial infection or heart
disease were excluded. these  <dig> collagen disease patients with aodild include 9
ae-ild,  <dig> di-ild, and no pneumocystis pneumonia. in this study, aodild
was classified to ae-ild, di-ild, and pneumocystis pneumonia as
following: pneumocystis pneumonia was defined by the presence of p.
jirovecii organisms detected by polymerase chain reaction for p.
jirovecii or grocott stain from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or sputa
of patients, di-ild was defined as aodild with treatment of di-ild causing drugs
 at onset after the exclusion of pneumocystis pneumonia,
ae-ild was defined as aodild without treatment of di-ild causing drugs at onset,
but with underlying cvd-ild, after the exclusion of pneumocystis
pneumonia and di-ild. these  <dig> patients with di-ild were treated at onset with
methotrexate , gold sodium thiomalate ,
tacrolimus , cyclophosphamide , or
etanercept . sera were collected on admission, and in the
stable state, at least three months before admission. they were classified
according to the american college of rheumatology criteria for ra  <cit> , systemic sclerosis   <cit> , and bohan’s criteria for polymyositis/dermatomyositis   <cit> . diagnoses of the patients included  <dig> ra,  <dig> ssc, and  <dig> pm/dm. these
 <dig> collagen disease patients with aodild include  <dig> patients who died and  <dig> who
survived, during the course of aodild. the major cause of death of these 11
patients would be respiratory failure due to aodild, though the complication of
infection due to repetitive corticosteroid pulse therapy could not be completely
excluded. this study was reviewed and approved by sagamihara hospital research
ethics committee. written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants except those already deceased before starting this study. the serum
samples collected before this study were anonymized in a fashion preventing any
link with the patients’ identification and their analysis approved on that
condition by sagamihara hospital research ethics committee. this study was
conducted in accordance with the principles expressed in the declaration of
helsinki.

biomarker immunoassay
raybio human cytokine antibody array  was used for
detection of  <dig> biomarkers in pooled sera of two states, aodild and stable,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the bio-plex suspension array
system  was used for detection of biomarkers in
individual sera from patients in the two different states, without pooling.
fluorokine map multiplex kits  were used for
detection of timp- <dig>  timp- <dig>  timp- <dig>  and timp- <dig>  milliplex map kits  were used for detection of transforming growth factor
-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  leptin, osteopontin, and insulin.
procarta cytokine plex kits  were used for
detection of mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  epidermal growth factor , -17f, il-1α,
il- <dig> receptor antagonist , il- <dig>  il- <dig> receptor α ,
il- <dig>  fas, fas ligand , tumor necrosis factor α, mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> 
mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  leukaemia inhibitory factor , and migration
inhibitory factor .

statistical analysis
differences in patient characteristics were analyzed by mann-whitney u test or
fisher’s exact test using 2× <dig> contingency tables. wilcoxon
signed-rank test or mann-whitney u test was performed in the comparison of
laboratory findings and biomarker assay results. it was defined statistical
significance as p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
characteristics of collagen disease patients with aodild
in 84%  of the patients with aodild, underlying cvd-ild had
been detected prior to the onset of aodild. mortality of patients during the
aodild state was 44% . lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea
nitrogen, kl- <dig>  and surfactant protein-d  were more increased in aodild
than in the stable state . albumin was decreased in the aodild state compared to these patients in the
stable state.

biomarker immunoassay
sera were pooled from  <dig> collagen disease patients in each state, i.e. stable and
aodild. we assessed the presence of  <dig> biomarkers in these two pooled sera.
eighteen of them were found to be present at less than  <dig>  times the level in
the pooled sera at aodild compared to the stable state . five biomarkers were present in aodild sera
at levels more than  <dig>  times the stable state. in addition to these 23
up-regulated or down-regulated biomarkers, several biomarkers were included from
the results of previous studies on ipf or ards for candidates of further
analysis  <cit> . thirty one biomarkers were selected based on the availability of
bead-based immunoassay for more detailed analysis. up-regulated soluble tnf
receptor ii in this pooled assay would be derived from the administered
recombinant soluble tnf receptor ii-fc fusion protein, etanercept. because
administration of antibody or recombinant cytokine receptors skews the cytokine
profile  <cit> , sera from the  <dig> ra patients treated with etanercept were excluded
from the following individual biomarker analysis. the serum biomarker levels of
the  <dig> collagen disease patients in the stable state and at aodild without
pooling are shown in table  <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  serum timp- <dig>  osteopontin, il-1ra,
il-2rα, il- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> levels were significantly increased in the aodild
state , whereas
timp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and eotaxin  <dig> levels were decreased. the ratio of mmp- <dig> to mmp-1
was reduced in the aodild state in these patients.

while the serum timp- <dig>  osteopontin, and il-2rα levels were increased in

ratio of mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> was also reduced in the aodild state in these patients.
these biomarker profiles were similar to that of collagen disease patients with
aodild.

serum biomarker profile of the patients with ae-ild or di-ild
we also explored biomarkers associated with aodild in the patients with ae-ild or
di-ild. characteristics of the ae-ild  and di-ild patients
 are shown in additional file 5:

these skewed biomarker profiles suggest differences in the pathogenesis of
aodild in patients with ae-ild or di-ild.

association of serum biomarker profile with outcome
the characteristics of  <dig> collagen disease patients with aodild are shown in
additional file 6: table s <dig>  there were no significant
differences between those who died and those who survived. kl- <dig> and sp-d were
increased and red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were decreased in
the aodild state of patients who died . lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen and kl- <dig> were
increased and albumin decreased in the aodild state in patients who survived
. timp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  osteopontin, il-2rα, mmp- <dig>  and mmp-8
levels were significantly increased in the aodild state in the deceased
patients. the ratio of mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> was decreased in the aodild state in the
deceased patients . on the other hand, the serum timp <dig> and mmp- <dig> levels were decreased
in the aodild state in patients who survived. thus, biomarker profiles were
different in patients with different outcomes.

discussion
many studies have reported on biomarker profiles in ipf or ards patients  <cit> . the roles of mmps and timps in ipf or ards have been reported  <cit> . involvement of other biomarkers in ipf or ards, including osteopontin  <cit> , eotaxin  <dig>   <cit> , il-1ra  <cit> , il- 2rα  <cit> , and il- <dig>  <cit> , were also inferred. the present study reports novel biomarker profiles
of aodild occurring in collagen disease patients, though a few of these biomarkers
have been analyzed previously in such patients with chronic cvd-ild  <cit> . administration of the cytokines found to be decreased, or blocking
cytokines found to be increased with antibodies or inhibitors could represent new
therapeutic approaches for aodild in collagen disease patients  <cit> .

we also propose that serum biomarker patterns could represent prognostic markers for
aodild in collagen diseases. several studies reported that the expression of mmp-1
and mmp- <dig> by fibroblasts and chondrocytes was correlated  <cit> . this was measured as the ratio of mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> and was maintained in
the sera of patients who survived, but not in those who died . similarly, different biomarker
profiles were seen in deceased and surviving patients. these biomarkers were
up-regulated in the sera of the patients with aodild who died  or
down-regulated in the sera of the patients with aodild who survived . these biomarker molecules might accelerate the progress of aodild and could
be targets blocked with antibodies or inhibitors for the treatment. since there were
no oppositely regulated biomarker molecules, we could not find any molecules that
might prevent the progress of aodild. role of other molecules in the pathological
state of aodild, such as timp- <dig>  eotaxin  <dig>  il-1ra, or il- <dig> could not be estimated
in this study. thus, the mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> ratio, and levels of timp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and
osteopontin could be prognostic markers for aodild in collagen diseases.

the serum osteopontin , il-1ra
, and il- <dig> 
levels were higher in patients who died in the aodild state, compared with those who
survived . the serum mmp-9
 and mmp-8
 levels were higher in patients who survived in the
stable state, compared with those who died . these
data suggest that some biomarkers could represent prognosis of the patients with
aodild, without comparison of the paired serum levels between stable and aodild
states.

the ratio of mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> was maintained in the sera of ae-ild patients . however, the
correlation was no longer present in di-ild patients . in addition, serum profiles of eotaxin  <dig> and mmp- <dig> were completely
different in patients with ae-ild and di-ild. the serum il-2rα,
 and mmp-1
 levels were higher in patients with di-ild in the
aodild state, compared with those with ae-ild . the
ratio of mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> was lower in patients with di-ild in the aodild state,
compared with those with ae-ild . the serum mmp- <dig>  level was higher in patients with di-ild in the stable state,
compared with those with ae-ild . thus, our findings
suggest the possibility of different pathogenesis of ae-ild and di-ild. because of
the limited sample size of this study, the expression pattern of these biomarkers
needs to be confirmed in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report of biomarker profiling in aodild occurring
in collagen disease patients. our findings support the role of serum biomarker
profiles as prognosis markers for aodild.
