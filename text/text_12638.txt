BACKGROUND
successful rearing of offspring in rodents involves the expression of a number of maternal behaviors including nursing, pup retrieval, nest building, and defense of offspring   <cit> . in association with lactation, the cns becomes less sensitive to the anxiogenic neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor   <cit> , suggesting that decreased crf neurotransmission during lactation could support maternal care. in support of this idea, recent work has shown that central injections of crf and related peptides dose-dependently impair maternal aggression in mice  <cit> . also, an earlier study found centrally injected crf decreased maternal care in maternally sensitized virgin female rats  <cit> . recent quantitative trait loci  analysis identified  <dig> possible qtls in mice as being associated with quality of maternal care  <cit> . among possible gene candidates in those were both crf and crf receptor  <dig> . although accumulating evidence links crf and it primary receptor to maternal care, no study to date has examined in detail how loss of the crfr <dig> gene affects maternal responding and aggression.

crf triggers peripheral increases in stress hormones   <cit>  as well as behavioral responses to stress  by acting within the cns . crf acts primarily on crfr <dig>  <cit> , but can also activate crf receptor  <dig>  with less efficacy  <cit> . we recently showed that mice missing crfr <dig> exhibit impaired maternal aggression, but normal pup retrieval behavior  <cit>  and speculated that the overproduction of crf in these crfr <dig> knockout mice acting on an intact crfr <dig> was responsible for the deficits in aggression.

a valuable approach for understanding the role of a gene in behavior is to examine behavioral changes when that gene is removed. crfr1-/- mice have been reported previously to display elevated levels of crf in the paraventricular nucleus, but not in amydala or other regions and to show decreased indices of fear and anxiety  <cit> . levels of crfr <dig> in these mice was not altered. crfr1-/- mice showed normal growth and reproduction, but crfr1-/- pups of crfr1-/- dams died within a few days of birth due to lung dysplasia likely due to a combination of low levels of glucocorticoids in the crfr1-/- dams and pups  <cit> . knockout pups of crf mutant mice show a more severe form of lung dysplasia and die within hours of birth due to low glucocorticoids in both dams and pups  <cit> . importantly, heterozygote offspring of crf mutant mothers show normal glucocorticoid levels and thus are resistant to maternal corticosterone deficiencies  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to examine whether or how loss of crfr <dig> affected a range of maternal behaviors, including maternal defense. because inbred strains show overall decreased fecundity in terms of litter size and reproduction rate relative to outbred mice, we examined the loss of the crfr <dig> gene in a mixed inbred/outbred background. further, to overcome any deleterious effects of maternal deficiencies in glucocorticoids in crfr1-/- mice, all mice were mated with outbred mice so that progeny would not be missing the crfr <dig> gene. given that centrally injected crf impairs maternal aggression and some behaviors and that the lactating cns is less responsive to crf, we speculated that crfr1-/- mice would show normal or even heightened levels of some maternal behaviors and aggression. however, if some levels of crf acting on crfr <dig> are necessary for maternal responding, it would be expected that certain behaviors would be impaired by the loss of the crfr <dig> gene. to gain insights into how crfr <dig> contributes to maternal care, we also examined c-fos and egr- <dig> expression in untested, naturally behaving wt and crfr1-/- mice.

RESULTS
maternal behaviors
maternal behaviors were examined on postpartum days  <dig> and  <dig> and a timeline of all testing is shown in fig.  <dig>  on postpartum day  <dig>  wt mice spent a significantly higher proportion of time nursing  than crfr1-/- mice  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; one-way anova) . further, while on the nest, crfr1-/- mice showed a non-significant trend towards a lower proportion of time nursing  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova  and spent a significantly greater proportion of time away from the nest  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; one-way anova). consistent with results of day  <dig>  on postpartum day  <dig>  wt mice spent a significantly higher proportion of time nursing than crfr1-/- mice  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; one-way anova) , while crfr1-/- mice spent a significantly lower proportion of time nursing while on nest  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; one-way anova) . proportion of time away from the nest did not differ  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) . when examined as a proportion of time on nest, proportion of time nursing  was significantly higher in wt relative to crfr1-/- mice on both test days . when the mean result for each mouse over the two test days was examined, proportion of time nursing still differed significantly between groups , including the different forms . however, proportion of time off nest was just above significance .

on postpartum day  <dig>  wt mice spent significantly higher proportion of time licking and grooming pups than crfr1-/- mice  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; anova on ranks) , whereas self grooming did not differ between genotype  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova . however, as a proportion of time while on nest, licking and grooming of pups did not differ between groups . no differences in proportion of time nest building  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova  and eating and drinking  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova  were found. on postpartum day  <dig>  proportion of time licking and grooming pups did not differ between genotype  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova . self grooming again did not differ between genotype on day  <dig>  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova . crfr1-/- mice spent a significantly higher proportion of time nest building  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; anova on ranks, dunn's method)  and eating and drinking  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; anova on ranks, dunn's method . when the mean result for each mouse over the two test days was examined, licking and grooming of pups was significantly higher in wt mice  and nest building was significantly lower in wt mice . self grooming and eating and drinking did not differ between groups .

mean pup number was almost identical between genotypes and did not differ significantly  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) . although pup number did not differ between genotypes, it was used as a covariate for analyzing some aggressive measures . in terms of mean dam weight  on postpartum day  <dig>  no differences existed between genotypes  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) . in contrast to dam weight and litter size, the weight of individual pups and total pup mass on postpartum day  <dig> differed significantly between genotypes. mean total weight of pups  was significantly higher in wt  relative to crfr1-/- mice   =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; one-way anova). further, mean weight of individual pups was significantly higher in wt relative to crfr1-/- mice  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; one-way anova) . proportion of time nursing on day  <dig> and  <dig> was significantly correlated with day  <dig> pup weight when all animals were examined together  and .

no differences were found between groups in terms of latency from pairing to birth .

maternal aggression
maternal aggression was consistently lower in crfr1-/- mice, but these differences approached, but did not reach significance using most statistical approaches. for example, maternal aggression did not differ between crfr1-/- and wt mice on postpartum day  <dig> in terms of percentage showing aggression  =  <dig> ; p >  <dig> ; anova on ranks, dunn's method) , number of attacks  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova , time in aggressive encounters  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova , or time to first attack  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; anova on ranks . on postpartum day  <dig>  in terms of number of attacks, crfr1-/- mice exhibited fewer attacks, but these differences were just above significance  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova . in terms of total time aggressive on day  <dig>  aggression differences  were also found to be just above significance using a non-parametric test  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; anova on ranks . when data were transformed to achieve normality using a power  <dig>  transform, neither a one-way anova  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) nor an ancova incorporating pup number as a covariate  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) indicated a difference between groups. when the mean result for each mouse over the two test days was examined, no differences were found between groups in terms of either time to first attack , number of attack , or total time aggressive .

when using a criterion of removing outliers more than  <dig> standard deviations from the mean, one knockout mouse can be excluded. with this data set, significant differences between groups were found in terms of number of attacks on days  <dig> and  <dig>  and time aggressive on day  <dig> .

in terms of the breakdown of total agonistic behavior , wt mice exhibited a significantly greater percentage attacks to the ventral portion of the mid-section  relative to crfr1-/- mice on day  <dig>  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; anova on ranks). for all other sites of attack, no differences existed between genotype . on average for day  <dig>  wt and crfr1-/- mice exhibited, respectively,  <dig> and 4% of attacks to the ventral portion of the mid-section ,  <dig> and 54% of attacks to the back/flank region,  <dig> and 35% of attacks to the head/neck region, and  <dig> and 7% clawing or lunging towards the intruder. on average for day  <dig>  wt and crfr1-/- mice exhibited, respectively,  <dig> and 2% of attacks to the ventral portion of the mid-section ,  <dig> and 44% of attacks to the head/neck region,  <dig> and 39% of attacks to the head/neck region, and  <dig> and 15% clawing or lunging towards the intruder. when results from both test days were combined, attacks to the belly were significantly higher in wt mice , but other sites of attack did not differ between groups .

pup retrieval
no significant differences in pup retrieval were observed between wt and crfr1-/- mice on either day  <dig>  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova on ranks; 1st pup; h =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova on ranks; 4th pup) or day  <dig>  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova; 1st pup; h =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova on ranks; 4th pup). on average, the retrieval time  for 1st pup was  <dig> for wt and  <dig> for crfr1-/- mice on day  <dig> and  <dig> for wt and  <dig> for crfr1-/- mice on day  <dig>  on average, the retrieval time  for 4th pup was  <dig> for wt and  <dig> for crfr1-/- mice on day  <dig> and  <dig> for wt and  <dig> for crfr1-/- mice on day  <dig> 

elevated plus maze test
on postpartum day  <dig>  total time in open arms    =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; anova on ranks) and closed arm    =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; anova) did not differ between genotypes. further, for no other measure, including latency to open arm  , number of visits to open arms , number of visits to closed arms , number of visits to middle square , and time in middle , were differences detected between genotype.

c-fos and egr- <dig> immunoreactivity in wt and crfr1-/- dams
baseline neuronal activity in wt and crfr1-/- mice was examined on postpartum day  <dig>  in terms of c-fos immunoreactivity, differences between groups were only found in bed nucleus of stria terminalis dorsal   =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) . a higher level of c-fos was found in piriform cortex  in crfr1-/- mice, but these differences did not reach significance  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) .

in terms of egr- <dig> immunoreactivity, differences between groups were only found in medial preoptic nucleus   =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) . consistent with c-fos increases, heightened egr- <dig> immunoreactivity was found in bnstd in wt mice, but these differences did not reach significance  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; one-way anova) . additional regions that approached significance between genotypes are shown in fig. 6b. examples of c-fos and egr- <dig> immunoreactivity are shown in fig.  <dig> 

discussion
in the present study, we show that knockout mice missing crfr <dig> exhibit deficiencies in nurturing behavior that include decreases in nursing and licking and grooming of pups. interestingly, pup retrieval is not altered in crfr1-/- mice and nest building is enhanced. maternal aggression was lower in knockout mice, but these differences did not reach significance using most tests. high variance in the aggression results makes these findings preliminary. because the loss of crfr <dig> alters both central signaling and glucocorticoid production, this study provides a detailed maternal profile of the crfr1-/- mice, but does not examine where or how the phenotype can be rescued. future studies using glucocorticoid replacement, cross fostering of pups, and spatial and temporal inactivation of crfr <dig> activity will be required to elucidate the basis of the maternal alterations.

increasing central crf levels   decreases maternal responding in maternally sensitized virgin rats  <cit> . further, studies in humans indicate that dysregulation of crf neurotransmission is linked to some forms of depression  <cit>  and depression, itself, has been linked to decreases in maternal care  <cit> . the simplest interpretation of our finding that loss of crfr <dig> impairs certain aspects of maternal care  is that a certain amount of crf tone acting on crfr <dig> is required for full maternal behavior expression. hence, with tone too low  or too high, maternal care is impaired. thus, crf acting on crfr <dig> could have an inverted u-shaped effect on maternal care. a link between crfr <dig> and maternal care was also recently suggested by a qtl study in mice  <cit> . because crf and its related peptides, ucn  <dig> and  <dig>  can activate crfr <dig>  <cit> , it is possible that increased activation of crfr <dig> compensates for the loss of crfr <dig> and contributes to alterations in maternal care. the differences in licking and grooming of pups is not as robust as for nursing and indeed, on day  <dig>  licking and grooming as a proportion of time on nest  does not differ between groups. however, mean licking and grooming of pups does differ significantly between groups whereas time off nest does not . the findings of altered licking and grooming of pups should be interpreted more cautiously given that altered time on nest could contribute to the phenotype. the elevation of nest building in crfr1-/- mice suggests that the deletion of this gene does not uniformly adversely affect maternal care and may enhance some forms of it. an examination of maternal behaviors in double knockouts of both receptors would help determine whether or how the receptors might work together to regulate maternal responding.

a drawback of knock-out studies is that the deletion of a gene may have developmental or compensatory effect that is separable from the functional use of the protein product as adults  <cit> . also, inbred mice are used as a background for most knockouts in mice, but inbred mice tend to have decreased fecundity relative to outbred mice. because we were interested in observing maternal care in crfr1-deficient mice, we took additional steps to improve overall levels of reproduction and allow better levels of maternal care against which to examine loss of the gene. outbred hsd:icr mice exhibit high fecundity and produce on average  <dig> pups per litter, almost twice the size of most inbred strains, including c57bl/ <dig>  the predominant background strain for most knockout mice. we have recently used the hsd:icr  strain to select for high levels of maternal aggression  <cit> . by crossing inbred mice with a deficiency into hsd:icr mice selectively bred for high maternal aggression, all mice in this study had a mixed inbred:outbred  background that produced high fecundity in both wt and crfr1-/- groups as evidenced by pregnancy rate and litter size. by using outbred breeder males we ensured that offspring of crfr1-/- mice would be heterozygote and thus genotype of offspring was less likely to influence dam behavior. because the genome of inbred mice has been reduce to single alleles, genetic interactions are decreased and it has been suggested that examinations of missing genes on a more variable, outbred background may be more relevant to understanding the role of genes in humans  <cit> . given that genetic background can affect behavioral phenotype in knockout mice  <cit> , it will be valuable in future studies to examine aggressive responding in crfr <dig> mutant mice with different genetic backgrounds .

crfr1-/- mice have previously been shown to exhibit lower than normal levels of glucocorticoids relative to wt mice, but a significant increase in corticosterone in response to a stressor occurs in crfr1-/- mice  <cit> . the greatest difference in glucocorticoid levels in wt and crfr1-/- females occurs in late afternoon  when wt females exhibit a surge, but crfr1-/- females do not. given differences in corticosterone between genotype, altered levels of this steroid could alter gene expression in the cns that interacts with a crfr1-deficient cns in a complex manner to affect behavior. recent work indicates that glucocorticoids in rats support certain maternal behaviors, such as licking and grooming of pups and increasing time in nest, but not nursing per se  <cit> . further, more recent work implicates glucocorticoids in maternal memory that would facilitate maternal care  <cit> . although differences in glucocorticoid levels could contribute to some aspects of the behavioral differences in genotype, corticosterone replacement was unable to rescue anxiety measure differences between genotypes  <cit> , suggesting some aspects of behavioral profiles in crfr1-/- mice are not glucocorticoid-dependent. future studies can address this issue by regulating corticosterone levels among the groups. an additional approach to understand the specificity of crfr <dig> in maternal behavior would be to use site-directed injections of a crfr <dig> antagonist and then examine behavioral responding.

crfr1-/- pups of crfr1-/- dams die within a few days of birth due to lung dysplasia due to low levels glucocorticoids in the crfr1-/- dams  <cit> . this profile is similar for knockout pups of crf mutant mice that show a more severe form of lung dysplasia and die within hours of birth due to low maternal glucocorticoids  <cit> . crfr1-/- mice treated with glucocorticoids during pregnancy and early lactation prevents pup death  <cit> , but detailed maternal care and offspring trajectories were not reported for this treatment. importantly, it has been shown that heterozygote offspring of crf mutant mothers show normal glucocorticoid levels and thus are resistant to maternal corticosterone deficiencies  <cit> . in this study, all offspring of crfr1-/- mice were heterozygote and should have been producing normal levels of glucocorticoids. the lack of any pup death in crfr1-/- mice supports the rescue effect of having one intact copy of crfr <dig> in offspring. having both genotypes foster pups derived from a different group of mice in future work would eliminate any role that pup genotype or exposure to maternal environment could have on maternal behavior.

the association between decreased nursing by crfr1-/- dams and decreased pup weight is striking and suggests the deficits lie in the dam and not the offspring. crfr1-/- dams showed elevated eating and drinking, time off nest, and nest building relative to wt mice, indicating the crfr1-/- dams did not suffer from an overall decrease in activity, but rather had a shift in behavioral profiles. further, crfr1-/- dams nursed significantly less even if one just examines percentage of total time on nest, which suggests a lack of propensity in crfr1-/- mice to nurse even with stimuli immediately present. the lack of difference between genotype in pup retrieval suggests the loss of the crfr <dig> gene could specifically affect more passive rather than active behaviors. as indicated above and below, the results on maternal aggression are considered preliminary. however, decreases in high arched-back nursing  was also decreased in crfr1-/- mice. the highly significant correlation between proportion of time nursing and pup weight across all mice suggests our observations across two days were sufficient to track behavioral differences that could provide a concrete explanation for differences in pup weight. because we did not monitor maternal behaviors at multiple times during the day and night, we cannot rule out the possibility that alterations in circadian cycle between genotypes explains our nursing differences. however, to date no such differences in circadian rhythm have been reported between these genotypes.

previous findings have indicated that crf neurotransmission is decreased in association with lactation. in support of this, during lactation in rodents  the cns is less responsive to centrally injected crf  <cit> ,  the cns shows decreased response to stressors  <cit> ,  crf-enhanced startle response is decreased  <cit> , and  females exhibit decreased fear and anxiety using a wide range of testing paradigms . it has previously been speculated that decreased fear and anxiety  during lactation may support maternal aggression by increasing the likelihood that a dam will attack a normally fear-evoking stimulus  <cit> . in support of this idea, we recently have shown that central injection of crf dose-dependently inhibits maternal aggression in mice  <cit> . in some cases, stressors applied pre-partum  impair maternal defense  <cit>  and crf neurotransmission may be decreased during lactation to help prevent environmental stressors  from unduly impairing the defense of offspring.

aggression levels were consistently lower in knockout mice and the high variance could have confounded results. as indicated, the differences in aggression between groups approached significance in a number of measures and when an outlier from the knockout group was removed, significant decreases in aggression were found in knockout mice in some measures. given the high variability of aggression in both groups, aggression results should be viewed as preliminary. if future work demonstrates a consistent deficit in aggression in crfr1-/- mice, this would be consistent with the idea that a certain level of activation of crfr <dig> is necessary for normal maternal defense. we previously found that icv injection of the crf receptor antagonist, d-phe-crf12– <dig>   <cit>  did not alter maternal aggression, but it is not known whether higher levels of antagonists would have impaired defense. one interpretation for lack of effect of receptor antagonist is that crf neurotransmission needs to be low during lactation for the proper expression of maternal aggression, but that other modulators positively regulate levels of aggression. in other words, the loss of crfr <dig> or the use of a crf receptor antagonist might represent a floor effect whereby further lowering already low levels of crf neurotransmission does not alter behavior  <cit> . recent work suggests that acute stressors applied postpartum also decrease maternal aggression <cit> . given that central release of crf acting on crfr <dig> is an important mediator of the behavioral responses to stress, it would be interesting in future studies to examine whether or how crfr1-/- and wt mice differ in how postpartum stressors affect maternal aggression.

we identified a difference between genotype in terms the sites of attack, with crfr1-/- mice attacking the ventral portion of the mid-section  less frequently on the second of two test days and when both test days were averaged. attacks to this region and also to the back/flank regions, especially in rats, has been termed offensive aggression, whereas attacks to the face/neck region have been termed defensive attacks  <cit> . this finding suggests that the loss of crfr <dig> may alter the final output of aggression. interestingly, in examinations of the brothers of the females tested in this study, intermale aggression was similar between genotypes, but a significant decrease in attacks by crfr1-/- male mice to ventral portion of the mid-section  was also found  <cit> . thus, for both maternal and intermale aggression, loss of crfr <dig> alters the final form of aggression in the same way. why this type of attack would be altered with loss of the crfr <dig> gene is unclear, but alteration in stress reactivity or glucocorticoid levels could be involved  <cit> . recent work in male hamsters found a crfr <dig> antagonist, ssr125543a, administered orally lengthened latency to attack and also decreased lateral attacks  <cit> , also suggesting a role for crfr <dig> in regulating the types of attacks performed. hence, additional studies that employ site-directed injections of crfr <dig> antagonists and a careful ethological examination of aggressive sites of attack will be useful in determining whether or how crfr <dig> may regulate final aggressive output.

the finding of no difference in measures of anxiety on the elevated plus maze between genotypes in lactating females on postpartum day  <dig> contrasts with the previous report of decreased anxiety in crfr1-/- mice  <cit> . in recent work with the wt and crfr1-/- brothers of the dams used in this study, we replicated the finding of significantly elevated time on open arms and decreased time on closed arms in crfr1-/- mice  <cit> . because lactating females show decreased anxiety on the elevated plus maze relative to virgin females  <cit> , our findings suggest that the effects of lactation remove the differences in performance between genotypes on this one test of anxiety. in a previous study on crfr <dig> knockout mice, we found a lack of difference in plus maze performance between genotype in lactating mice  <cit>  whereas differences in anxiety in virgin female mice had been reported using a different measure  <cit> . thus, in two cases a loss of anxiety differences with genotype with lactation has been found. however, in rats bred for high and low anxiety, differences in anxiety persist during the postpartum period  <cit> , indicating that lactation does not necessarily affect group differences in phenotype. changes in neurotransmission during lactation of other neuromodulators that can alter indices of anxiety, such as oxytocin, prolactin, or gaba  <cit> , may have helped remove or mask the normal differences in anxiety between the genotypes in this study. one possibility is that preexisting anxiety differences in crfr1-/- and wt mice are not as great as for high and low anxiety bred rats, and these differences are more susceptible to the effects of lactation. it is also possible, though, that two days of aggression testing altered plus maze performance.

examinations of c-fos and egr- <dig> in wt and crfr1-/- dams allowed for possible insights into where underlying neuronal activity differences may account for maternal differences. because these mice were untested, it is thought that immediate early gene activity seen reflects activity that is associated with the production of maternal care. c-fos and egr- <dig> were both used as indirect markers of neuronal activity because together they can provide complementary information on differences in brain activity  <cit> . because mpom is implicated in numerous aspects of maternal care, including nursing  <cit> , the finding of lower egr- <dig> activity in mpom in crfr1-/- mice suggests the possibility of subthreshold activation of this region is involved in the nursing deficit. the lower c-fos activity in bnstd  in crfr1-/- mice  suggests altered activity in this region could also underlie behavioral deficits. however, this portion of bnst has more frequently been associated with maternal aggression rather than other maternal behaviors  <cit> . other regions approaching significant differences in activity between genotype  could also underlie behavioral differences, but this would need to be addressed experimentally.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study indicate specific nurturing deficits in crfr1-/- mice that include nursing and licking and grooming of pups. crfr <dig> is widely expressed throughout the cns and it appears that activation of the receptor helps support the full expression of a subset of maternal behaviors. certain other maternal behaviors were unaffected by the loss of crfr <dig> , so this receptor does not appear necessary for full expression of all maternal behaviors. the trend towards decreased aggression in the knockout mice coupled with high variance makes any conclusions regarding this measure preliminary. where and how loss of crfr <dig> contributes to behavioral alterations is not known, but one possible site is mpom as was suggested by egr- <dig> expression differences between genotype.
