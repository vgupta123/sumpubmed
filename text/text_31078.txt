BACKGROUND
bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by many species of bacteria and some members of the archaea domain. nisin, the most well-known bacteriocin, is produced by lactococcus lactis strains and it belongs to the lantibiotic class of bacteriocins; nisin has gras status  and is currently the only bacteriocin approved for use as a food preservative  <cit> . other bacteriocins, such as pediocin pa-1/ach and lacticin  <dig>  are also commercially available, but are marketed as fermentates of lactic acid bacteria  having gras status  <cit> .

the targeted mechanism of action and the relatively low propensity to select resistant bacteria are attractive properties of the lantibiotics. moreover, previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of many lantibiotics against target bacteria  <cit>  and also the potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications of these peptides  <cit> . despite the good results obtained in vitro, the large scale application of lantibiotics remains limited due to the lack of data regarding clinical aspects, including the destiny of the peptides after ingestion, the loss of antimicrobial activity, the cytotoxicity and the immunostimulatory effects triggered by these peptides in vivo  <cit> .

in order to evaluate the in vivo toxicity, an antimicrobial peptide should be administered daily and repeatedly to an animal model for a required period of time  <cit> , and the route of administration should be the same proposed for use in vivo  <cit> . because lantibiotics generally have low molecular mass and little intrinsic immunogenicity, coupling of these peptides to protein carriers or the use of adjuvants can be useful strategies to enhance the immunogenicity  <cit> .

bovicin hc <dig>  a lantibiotic produced by the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis hc <dig>  has desirable properties, such as broad spectrum of activity, stability to low ph and high temperatures  <cit> . the mechanism of action of bovicin hc <dig> was recently elucidated and it is based on the specific interaction with lipid ii molecule, leading to inhibition of the bacterial cell wall synthesis and eventually to pore-formation  <cit> . previous results indicated that the in vitro toxicity of bovicin hc <dig> against mammalian cells is comparable to nisin  <cit> . bovicin hc <dig> has been suggested as a potential alternative to classical antibiotics in livestock production and as an additive for food preservation  <cit> .

to gain insight about the safety use of bovicin hc <dig> on animal hosts, we analyzed the effects of orally administrated bovicin hc <dig> to balb/c mice, focusing on gastrointestinal permeability, morphological alterations in the gi tract and the immunostimulatory effects of the peptide. we used a murine model of enteropathy induced by sensitization to compare the effects caused by the administration of bovicin hc <dig> 

RESULTS
the administration of bovicin hc <dig> induces less weight gain in balb/c mice
the weight of balb/c mice was monitored during the trial period to verify if the sensitization followed by challenge with bovicin hc <dig> or ovalbumin affected weight gain of the animals, which could indicate clinical manifestation of allergy or gastrointestinal disorders. symptoms as diarrhea, intestinal bleeding or rectal prolapsed were not observed.

prior to the experiment, no significant differences were detected among the average weight of the mice . in the nc group, the average mice weight ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g , or a weight gain of  <dig> % along the trial period.

animals sensitized with bovicin hc <dig> or ovalbumin gained weight only during the three initial weeks of the experiment, before starting the oral administration of bovicin hc <dig> or ovalbumin. after 58 days of experiment, the percentage of weight gain was  <dig>  and − <dig> % for animals of the bov and pc groups, respectively, which was significantly lower compared to the nc group . there was no significant difference of weight gain between the bov and pc groups .

gastrointestinal permeability is not altered upon oral administration of bovicin hc5
no β-lactoglobulin  was detected in serum samples obtained before β-lg administration or in samples from the nc group after administration of β-lg. in sera obtained from animals of the pc group, significant amounts of β-lg were detected after  <dig> ,  <dig> and 2 h of β-lg administration . after 5 h of administration, β-lg could not be detected in the pc group, suggesting that β-lg clearance required at least 5 h to occur. in the bov group, low concentrations of β-lg  were detected in animal sera after 5 h of β-lg administration .

oral administration of bovicin hc <dig> and ovalbumin induce histological and morphometric alterations in the intestine of balb/c mice
no alterations were identified in the liver and heart of animals from all the groups analyzed . a significant decrease in the total number of spleen cells was observed in bov and pc groups, when compared to the nc group .

the small intestine of the nc group presented a well-preserved villi and crypts, with intact intestinal layers . in the bov group, the severity of the effects varied among the animals and major alterations were observed in the lamina propria  and in the apical portion of the villi, with a “worst case scenario” being presented in figure 4b and 4e. as expected, the animals from the pc group developed intestinal inflammation, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue destruction, epithelial exulceration, edema and congestion of the lamina propria .

morphometric analysis of the small and large intestine of the animals treated with bovicin hc <dig> or ovalbumin showed some impairment of the intestinal structure integrity, but the severity of the alterations caused by bovicin hc <dig> and ovalbumin was clearly different.

the number of pas+ cells, which secrete only neutral mucopolysaccharides, did not differ among the groups , and cells secreting exclusively acid mucins  were not detected. the majority of goblet cells in nc group was pas/ab+ cells, which secrete both neutral and acidic mucopolysaccharides . the number of pas/ab+ cells did not differ between the nc and bov groups, but it was significantly reduced in pc group . no differences were observed in the total number of goblet cells in the small intestine of bov group, when compared to the nc group. however, the total number of goblet cells in the small intestine of pc group was reduced when compared to bov and nc groups .

analysis of the lieberkühn glands indicated hypertrophy of paneth cells  and an increase in the number of mitotic cells  in bov and pc groups when compared to the nc group , although no differences were observed between bov and pc groups . no alteration on the number of mast cells on jejunum segments  was observed between bov and nc groups, although a significant increase has been observed in pc group  .

in pc group, the jejunum segments demonstrated a significant increase  in the number of mast cells from the mucosa and submucosa , when compared to bov and nc groups.

in the small intestine of animals from the bov group, significant villous atrophy accompanied by villi enlargement was observed. in pc group, the increase of the villous diameter was even more pronounced when compared to the bov group , although the height of the villi was not altered, when compared to nc group .

the large intestine of the nc group was normal and with a homogenous aspect . the effects of bovicin hc <dig> and ovalbumin were less evident in the large intestine of the animals. no differences on epithelium structure or cellularity were detected in bov group , while a moderate edema at the lamina propria  and a significant reduction at the mucosal thickness  were detected among the animals from the pc group .

assessment of the immunostimulatory effects on spleen and small intestine of animals treated with bovicin hc <dig> or ovalbumin
there was no difference in relative gene expression of cytokines in the spleen when the means of the bov and nc groups were compared. only the il- <dig> mrna expression differed among the groups, with the pc group showing the highest expression levels in the spleen  . in the small intestine, the relative expression of il- <dig>  inf-γ and tnf-α was significantly higher for the bov group , while the il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> mrna expression was significantly higher in the pc group . the mrna levels of tgf-β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> did not differ between the groups .

discussion
in this study, we used a murine model of food-induced enteropathy in order to compare the morphological and immunostimulatory effects of the orally administered bovicin hc <dig>  in our positive control group, the breakdown of mucosal tolerance was obtained by oral administration of the non-tolerogenic antigen ovalbumin . ova has become a reference protein for immunological and biochemical studies, being widely used as an antigen for studying allergic diseases in mice  <cit> .

the model used to induce food enteropathy worked properly, and an inflammatory reaction was developed in the small intestine. ova administration altered the small intestinal architecture, increased protein permeability, caused edema and decrease the mucosal thickness in the large intestine. in contrast, upon oral administration of bovicin hc <dig>  only minor histological alterations indicative of inflammation or alterations on permeability were observed, although an atrophy of the villi and destruction of the apical portion of the villi were detected in some regions of the small intestine.

the degree of impairment of the small intestine could explain the differences observed in weight gain between bov and pc groups throughout the experiment, since these alterations may have influenced the absorption of nutrients. saldanha et al. <cit>  reported that balb/c mice previously sensitized lost weight after challenging with ova, which remained until the end of the experiment.

in normal conditions, the number of mast cells in the intestine is relatively constant, but hyperplasia can be observed during inflammatory reactions or during stages of remodeling/repair of inflammatory disorders  <cit> . as a result of the food enteropathy developed upon administration of ova, we observed increased number of mast cells in the small intestine of pc group. however, no alterations were observed in the mast cell population from the bov group.

bacterial products or cell components may induce metaplasia, proliferation and hypersecretion of goblet cells  <cit> . in this study, animals treated with ova showed reduced number of goblet cells in the small intestine, and a reduction in the secretion of acidic and neutral mucins. in contrast, the administration of bovicin hc <dig> did not alter the total number or the pattern of goblet cell secretion. the mucus protects the intestinal wall by limiting the absorption of antigens, and therefore, the hypersecretion of mucopolysaccharides was expected at the pc group, as a characteristic of allergic inflammation and as a result of increased il- <dig> expression  <cit> ; therefore, the reduction in the number of cells responsible for mucus secretion observed in pc group may not be related to the reduction in the secretion process per se, but to the limited count fields resulting from the destruction of the villi observed in pc group.

similar to goblet cells, paneth cells also play an important role in host intestinal defense mechanisms, contributing to the maintenance of the gastrointestinal barrier by secreting antimicrobial peptides and other compounds in response to bacteria and bacterial antigens  <cit> . the presence of antigens in the gastrointestinal tract also influence the expression and activity of key proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation  <cit> . hypertrophy of paneth cells and increased mitotic activity were observed in bov and pc groups, indicating that despite the loss of villi architecture, secretion of antimicrobial compounds and tissue repair systems remained active, probably as a response to the injuries caused by bovicin hc <dig> and ova in the small intestine.

our results indicate that the effects of bovicin hc <dig> and ovalbumin administration are more pronounced in the intestine, which can explain the significant reduction in spleen cellularity observed in bov and pc groups: immune cells probably migrated from the spleen to the intestine, where the main effects were observed.

ova administration modulated the gut mucosal immunity in balb/c mice towards significant th2-polarized response, increasing the relative expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> mrna. goya et al. <cit>  also observed increased mrna levels of the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  as well as a decrease of inf-γ expression in the lungs of ova-treated mice. a down modulation of regulatory mechanisms, with reduction of tgf-β and il- <dig> expression, may be involved in the development of food allergy  <cit> , but this pattern of cytokine expression, although expected, was not observed in this study.

the modulation of the host immune system induced by bacteriocins is a phenomenon much less understood when compared to other peptides or proteins, such as proteins extracted from mushrooms   <cit> , fip-vvo   <cit>  and fip-fve   <cit> ) and host-defense peptides  <cit> .

in contrast to the th2-polarized response elicited by ova, higher mrna expression for the th <dig> cytokines tnf-α, il- <dig> and inf-γ were observed in the intestine of bovicin hc5-fed mice. liu et al.  <cit>  also demonstrated significant induction of ifn-γ after administration of the yam tuber storage protein dioscorin. human cathelicidin ll- <dig> modulated the activity of ifn-γ on a variety of cell types  <cit> , and pre-treatment with ll- <dig> induced ifn-γ production by monocytes, enhancing monocyte-derived dendritic cell functions, such as il- <dig> secretion and th1-polarized co-stimulatory activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, for the first time, the effects of the oral administration of bovicin hc <dig> to an animal model were described. the bovicin hc <dig> concentration administrated to the animals  was greater than the quantities required for in vitro antimicrobial activity . we have previously demonstrated that bovicin hc <dig>  in higher con-centrations, was able to permeabilize membranes in an unspecific way  <cit> , but one should bear in mind that antimicrobial peptides can also modulate the microbial community composition in the intestine which could explain the partial destruction of small intestine cells caused by bovicin hc <dig> administration. nonetheless, the impairment of the intestinal cells induced by bovicin hc <dig> neither altered the gut permeability nor was typical of an enteropathy process. regarding the immunostimulatory effects, the results confirmed that bovicin hc <dig> was able to stimulate the immune system of balb/c mice at local level , by influencing the cytokine release towards th1-polarized response.

proper pharmacokinetic studies will be needed to determine if bovicin hc <dig> can resist passage through the adverse conditions in the gi tract , but it should be noted that animals treated with bovicin hc <dig> showed more pronounced effects in the intestine compared to the animals in the negative control groups. these results suggest that the oral administration of bovicin hc <dig> might be a promising strategy to control microbial infections, manipulate microbial community composition or modulate immunological responses in the gi tract of the host animal.
