BACKGROUND
protein homology detection is one of the most intensively researched problems in bioinformatics. researchers are increasingly depending on computational techniques to classify proteins into functional or structural classes by means of homologies. most methods can detect homologies at high levels of sequence similarity, while accurately detecting homologies at low levels of sequence similarity  is still a challenging problem.

many powerful methods and algorithms have been proposed to address the remote homology detection and fold recognition problems. some methods are based on the pairwise similarities between protein sequences. smith-waterman dynamic programming algorithm  <cit>  finds an optimal score for similarity according to a predefined objective function. rankprop  <cit>  relies upon a precomputed network of pairwise protein similarities. some heuristic algorithms, such as blast  <cit>  and fasta  <cit>  trade reduced accuracy for improved efficiency. these methods do not perform well for remote homology detection, because the alignment score falls into a twilight zone when the protein sequences similarity is below 35% at the amino acid level  <cit> . later methods challenge this problem by incorporating the family information. these methods are based on a proper representation of protein families and can be split into two groups  <cit> : generative models and discriminative algorithms. generative models provide a probabilistic measure of association between a new sequence and a particular family. these methods such as profile hidden markov model   <cit>  can be trained iteratively in a semi-supervised manner using both positively labeled and unlabeled samples of a particular family by pulling in close homology and adding them to the positive set  <cit> . the discriminative algorithms such as support vector machines   <cit>  provide state-of-the-art performance. in contrast to generative models, the discriminative algorithms focus on learning a combination of the features that discriminate between the families. these algorithms are trained in a supervised manner using both positive and negative samples to establish a discriminative model. the performance of svm depends on the kernel function, which measures the similarity between any pair of samples. there are two approaches for deriving the kernel function. one approach is the direct kernel, which calculates an explicit sequence similarity measure. another approach is the feature-space-based kernel, which chooses a proper feature space, represents each sequence as a vector in that space and then inner product  between these vector-space representations is taken as a kernel for the sequences  <cit> .

direct kernel
la kernel  <cit>  is one of the direct kernel functions. this method measures the similarity between a pair of protein sequences by taking into account all the optimal local alignment scores with gaps between all possible subsequences. another method is sw-pssm  <cit>  which is derived directly from explicit similarity measures and utilizes sequence profiles. the experiment results show that this kernel is superior to previously developed schemes.

feature-space-based kernel
svm-fisher  <cit>  is one of the early attempts with the feature-space-based kernel, this method represents each protein sequence as a vector of fisher scores extracted from a profile hidden markov model  for a protein family. svm-pairwise  <cit>  is another successful method, in which each protein sequence is represented as a vector of pairwise similarities to all protein sequences in the training set. the svm-i-sites method  <cit>  compares sequence profiles to the i-sites library of local structural motifs for feature extraction. later, this method is improved by using the order and relationships of the i-site motifs  <cit> . svm-balsa  <cit>  represents each protein sequence by a vector of bayesian alignment scores associated with each training sample. the feature spaces in spectrum kernel  <cit>  consist of all short subsequence of length k . svm-n-peptide  <cit>  improves spectrum kernel by using reduced amino acid alphabets to reduce the dimensions of the feature vectors. mismatch kernel  <cit>  considers a k-mer to be present if a sequence contains a substring which differs with the k-mer at most a predefined number of mismatches. profile kernel  <cit>  considers a k-mer to be present if a sequence contains a substring whose pssm-based ungapped alignment score with the k-mer is above a predefined threshold. lingner and meinicke  <cit>  notice the distances between k-mers and introduce a feature vector based on the distances between the k-mers. the feature vector of emotif kernel  <cit>  is based on motifs extracted with the unsupervised emotif method  <cit>  from the eblocks database  <cit> . gpkernel  <cit>  is another motif kernel based on discrete sequence motifs, which are evolved using genetic programming. svm-hustle  <cit>  builds a svm classifier for a query sequence by training on a collection of representative high-confidence training sets, recruits additional sequences and assigns a statistical measure of homology between a pair of sequences.

multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences contain a lot of evolutionary information. this information can be obtained by analyzing the output of psi-blast  <cit> . since the protein sequence frequency profile is a richer encoding of protein sequences than the individual sequence, it is of great significance to use such evolutionary information for protein remote homology detection and fold recognition. in our previous study, we introduced a feature vector of protein sequence based on binary profiles  <cit>  which contain the evolutionary information of the protein sequence frequency profiles. the protein sequence frequency profiles are converted into binary profiles with a probability threshold. in detail, when the frequency of a given amino acid is higher than the threshold it is converted into an integral value  <dig>  otherwise it is converted into  <dig>  binary profile can be viewed as a building block of proteins. it has been successfully applied in many computational biology tasks, such as the domain boundary prediction  <cit> , the knowledge-based mean force potentials  <cit>  and the protein binding sites prediction  <cit> . although the methods based on binary profiles give exciting results, binary profiles have several shortcomings. firstly, the threshold which is used to convert the protein sequence frequency profiles into binary profiles is set by experience. because there is no systematic method that could be used to optimize the threshold, there is no guarantee to find the best threshold. secondly, binary profiles cannot discriminate the amino acids with different frequencies in the protein sequence frequency profiles. the amino acids whose frequencies are higher than the threshold are all converted into  <dig>  which omits that these amino acids have different frequencies and different importance during evolutionary processes.

to overcome these shortcomings, in this study we present a novel building block of proteins called top-n-grams to use the evolutionary information of the protein sequence frequency profiles and apply this novel building block to remote homology detection and fold recognition. the protein sequence frequency profiles calculated from the multiple sequence alignments outputted by psi-blast  <cit>  are converted into top-n-grams by combining the n most frequent amino acids in each amino acid frequency profile. the protein sequences are transformed into fixed-dimension feature vectors by the occurrence times of each top-n-gram and then the corresponding vectors are inputted to svm. in our previous studies  <cit> , we applied lsa  <cit>  to protein remote homology detection. several basic building blocks have been investigated as the "words" of "protein sequence language", including n-grams  <cit> , patterns  <cit> , motifs  <cit>  and binary profiles  <cit> . here, we also demonstrate that the use of lsa on top-n-grams can improve the prediction performance of both remote homology detection and fold recognition.

the influence of n on remote homology and fold recognition
top-n-grams are generated by combining the n most frequent amino acids in the amino acid frequency profiles . here, we investigate the influence of n on the prediction performance. as shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  in terms of the roc <dig> scores, the rates indicate that our method performs well for n =  <dig> and n =  <dig> and with a slight decrease of the roc <dig> score for n =  <dig>  the third most frequent amino acids in the amino acid frequency profiles are less likely to occur in the specific sequence positions during evolutionary processes, which might be the reason for the decrease of the prediction performance for n =  <dig> 

we plot top-1-grams's roc <dig> scores against top-2-grams's roc <dig> scores on all the test sets for the scop  <dig>  superfamily benchmark and scop  <dig>  fold benchmark . this figure show that the two building blocks are complementary, so they can be combined to create a new building block of proteins to solve remote homology detection and fold recognition problems. in detail, the protein sequences are transformed into fixed-dimension feature vectors by the occurrence times of each top-n-gram in top-1-grams and top-2-grams. therefore, these vectors are the combinations of the corresponding vectors of the method based on top-1-grams and the ones of the method based on top-2-grams. the dimension of the combined feature vector is  <dig> . compared with the best roc <dig> scores achieved by the method based on single building block, the roc <dig> scores of the method based on the combined building block are  <dig> percent and  <dig>  percent higher for remote homology detection and fold recognition, respectively.

lsa can improve the performance of building-block-based methods for both remote homology and fold recognition problems
the latent semantic analysis  <cit>  is used on top-n-grams to remove noise and compress data. figure  <dig> shows the family-by-family comparison of the roc scores between the method with lsa and without lsa when top-n-grams are taken as the basic building blocks on scop  <dig>  superfamily benchmark. each point on the figure corresponds to one of the tested families. when the families are in the left-upper area, it means that the method labelled by y-axis outperforms the method labelled by x-axis on this family. figure  <dig> shows the superfamiy-by-superfamily comparison of the roc scores on scop  <dig>  fold benchmark. obviously, when top-n-grams are taken as the building blocks, the method with lsa outperforms the method without lsa for both remote homology detection and fold recognition. as shown in table  <dig>  when lsa is applied, performance improvement is also observed for the methods using n-grams, patterns, motifs and binary profiles as the building blocks.

the method based on top-n-gram significantly outperforms the other building-block-based methods and most existing methods
our method significantly outperforms the other building-block-based methods and most existing methods, except profile and sw-pssm. figure  <dig> shows the relative performance of the compared methods on the scop  <dig>  superfamily benchmark. svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa significantly outperforms the four building-block-based methods in terms of roc scores  and roc <dig> scores . svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa also has significantly higher roc scores than psi-blast and svm-pairwise  and significantly higher roc <dig> scores than psi-blast, svm-pairwise and svm-la , but svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa and svm-la's roc scores are not significantly different . in terms of roc scores profile is significantly better than svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa , but profile's roc <dig> scores are not significantly better than those of svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa . sw-pssm is the best method in terms of roc scores  and roc <dig> scores . by plotting svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa's roc <dig> scores against profile's roc <dig> scores on all test sets , we find that the two methods are complementary. this result is not surprising, because the two methods depend on distinct features. maybe the two methods can be combined to create an improved method for protein remote homology detection by using the method that is recently proposed by damoulas and girolami  <cit> .

svm-bprofile and svm-top-n-gram refer to the methods based on the two building blocks: binary profiles and top-n-grams respectively. the methods with lsa suffix refer to the corresponding methods after latent semantic analysis. source is the sources of results. the results of the methods based on binary profiles were obtained by running the implementation of our previous work.

computational efficiency
one important aspect of any homology detection method is its computational efficiency. in this regard, svm-top-n-gram-combine-lsa is comparable with profile and more efficient than svm-bprofile-lsa, svm-pattern-lsa, svm-motif-lsa, svm-pairwise, svm-la and sw-pssm, but a little worse than svm-ngram-lsa, psi-blast and the method without lsa.

where n is the number of training samples, l is the length of the longest training sequence, m is the total number of the words of each building block, t is the minimum of n and m and r is the length of the latent semantic feature vector.

the combine suffix refers to top-n-grams combining top-1-grams and top-2-grams. n-grams are the set of all possible subsequences of a fixed length  <dig>  so the total words of n-grams are  <dig>   <cit> . patterns are extracted by teiresias  <cit>  and totally  <dig> patterns are extracted  <cit> . through χ <dig> selection  <cit> ,  <dig> patterns are selected as the characteristic words  <cit> . the meme/mast system  <cit>  is used to discover motifs and search databases. totally,  <dig> motifs are extracted  <cit> . the optimized probability threshold  <dig>  is used to convert the protein sequence frequency profiles into binary profiles and  <dig> words are obtained  <cit> . top-1-grams and top-2-grams have  <dig> and  <dig> words respectively, so the total words of top-n-gram-combine are  <dig> .

correlations between top-n-grams and protein families
one of the main advantages of our method is the possibility to analyze the correlations between top-n-grams and protein families and reveal biologically relevant properties of the underlying protein families.

in document classification field, the chi-square algorithm is one of the most effective feature selection methods, which is able to select the most discriminative features by their average chi-square scores  <cit> . according to the above results, top-2-grams show highly discriminative power. therefore, the chi-square algorithm is used to measure the correlations between top-2-grams and protein families and can be compared to the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom to judge extremeness . the average chi-square score of each top-2-gram in all the tested families on scop  <dig>  superfamily benchmark is shown in figure  <dig> and the average chi-square score of each top-2-gram in all the tested superfamilies on scop  <dig>  fold benchmark is shown in figure  <dig>  according to the darkest spots in the figures, top-2-gram "kr" has the highest score on superfamily benchmark and top-2-grams "li" has the highest score on fold benchmark. therefore, these two top-2-grams are selected for further analysis. figure  <dig> shows the chi-square scores of "kr" in all the  <dig> tested families on scop  <dig>  superfamily benchmark. as shown in this figure, "kr" is highly correlated with family  <dig> , correlated with family  <dig>   <dig>  and also correlated with family  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . the test statistics for "kr" with some other families are above the threshold for statistical significance , but these scores are considerably lower than the ones listed above. the results indicate that "kr" is highly correlated with specific families and biologically relevant families tend to having similar chi-square scores, indicating "kr" is likely to contain important structural or functional information of the specific families. similar results are also obtained for fold recognition. figure  <dig> shows the chi-square scores of "li" in all the  <dig> tested superfamilies on scop  <dig>  fold benchmark. "li" is highly correlated with superfamily  <dig> and  <dig>  and also correlated with superfamily  <dig>   <dig> , indicating the importance of "li" for these biologically relevant superfamilies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present a novel representation of protein sequences based on top-n-grams and apply the latent semantic analysis to improve the prediction performance of both protein remote homology detection and fold recognition. top-n-grams make up of a novel building block of protein sequences and the analysis presented here is based on evolutionary information without using any structural information. compared with other building-block-based methods, such as n-grams, patterns, motifs or binary profiles, additional evolutionary information is extracted from the protein sequence frequency profile. the experiment results show that this additional evolutionary information is relevant for discrimination.

using standard classifier, the results show that the prediction performance of our method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods within the field of remote homology detection and fold recognition. although profile and sw-pssm yield better results, it should be noted that both the two methods comprise several parameters. the performance of profile depends on a smoothing parameter and the performance of sw-pssm depends on three parameters: gap opening, gap extension and a continuous parameter zero-shift. the extensive use of parameters bares the risk of adapting the model to particular test set, which complicates a fair comparison of different methods and the application of the methods to different dataset, because new dataset is likely to require readjustment of these parameters  <cit> . furthermore, because the performance can decrease for non-optimal values of these parameters, a time-consuming model selection process would be necessary for these methods to achieve optimal results. in contrast, homogeneity of roc scores for top-1-grams and top-2-grams indicates the good generalization performance of our method, which obviates the tuning of any parameter and therefore our method does not require a time consuming optimization and avoids the risk of fitting the data to the test set.

another advantage of our approach arises from the explicit feature space representation: the possibility to measure the correlations between top-n-grams and protein families. compared with other building-block-based methods, top-n-grams significantly improve the detection performance while preserving the favourable interpretability of the building-block-based methods by an explicit feature space representation. as shown in results and discussion section, our method allows the researchers to analyze the correlations between top-n-grams and protein families and reveal biologically relevant properties of the underlying protein families. in contrast, direct-kernel-based methods without explicit feature spaces, such as sw-pssm and svm-la, do not provide an intuitive insight into the associated feature space for further analysis of relevant sequence features. therefore, these kernels do not offer additional utility for researchers who are interested in finding the characteristic features of protein families.

top-n-grams make up of a novel building block of protein sequences, which contains the evolutionary information extracted from the protein sequence frequency profiles. the results show that this building block has significantly higher discriminative power than many other building blocks. because this novel building block is able to flexibly represent the proteins at sequence-level and residue-level, it can be used to investigate the whole protein sequence and the individual residue. many applications of top-n-grams are conceivable: e.g. the sequence alignment, the prediction of domain boundary, the designation of knowledge-based potentials and the prediction of protein binding sites.
