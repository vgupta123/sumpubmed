BACKGROUND
despite the growing number of animal species with completely sequenced mitochondrial  genomes, surprisingly little is known about the mt transcriptome, even for mammals. several recent papers have reviewed the mammalian mt transcriptome based on human data , while for other mammals even the basic characteristics, including the location of the transcript ends or presence of untranslated regions  and intergenic sequences , have not yet been described. this is surprising given that the mt genome sequence of the mouse  has been known for over 30 years  <cit> .

the mt genome of mammals typically consists of ~ <dig>  kb circular, double-stranded dna that contains  <dig> genes coding for  <dig> protein subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation  system, two ribosomal rnas , and  <dig> transfer rnas . the individual genes are unequally distributed between the heavy  and light  strands, with the majority of the genes encoded on the h strand, except for the nad <dig> gene and eight of trnas.

each strand of human mtdna has its own promoter and both strands are transcribed as polygenic or polycistronic precursor transcription units, which are processed to release trnas, rrnas and mrnas  <cit> . there are two h-strand promoter/transcription initiation sites, one located in the control region  and one near the 5′ end of rrns , and one l-strand promoter located in the control region   <cit> . both hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> initiate transcription in the same direction, but the transcription from hsp <dig> produces a full-length transcript covering the two rrnas,  <dig> mrnas and  <dig> trnas, while the transcription from hsp <dig> terminates downstream of rrnl, transcribing only trnf, rrns, trnv and rrnl  <cit> . the existence of two distinct promoters is probably the basis for the differential regulation of synthesis of the rrnas and h-strand encoded mrnas, with the transcription from hsp <dig> being responsible for the synthesis of the majority of rrna  <cit> . similar to hsp <dig>  the transcription initiated at lsp covers a large portion of the mt genome and includes the one mrna  and the eight trnas encoded on the l strand  <cit> .

most of cleavage events required to release the mrnas, trnas and rrnas from these precursor transcripts can be accounted for by the ‘trna punctuation’ model  <cit> . according to the model, trnas are endonucleolytically excised from the precursor transcripts and the fragments that remain are processed to functional mrna and rrna transcripts. the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mrna and rrna transcripts are therefore defined by the endpoints of the intervening trna sequences  <cit> . this model ensures that adjacent mrna and trna genes do not overlap or a trna excision would result in truncated mrna . a striking, well-demonstrated feature of human mt transcription in which it deviates from the trna punctuation model is that two transcription units remain as bicistronic elements containing overlapping open reading frames  encoding atp <dig> and atp <dig>  and nad4l and nad <dig>  respectively  <cit> . such overlapping orfs are present in mtdna sequences of other mammals too, but a presence of mature mt bicistronic mrnas in mammals other than human remains to be demonstrated.

due to the absence of transcriptome data, annotation of mt genomes of non-human mammals relies on homology with the human genome or is purely the result of interpretation of the mt genome sequence. for example, there are two instances of an overlapping tag stop codon  and downstream trna in the ncbi reference sequence of the house mouse  mitochondrion  in an annotation apparently inferred solely from the mt genome sequence, while in human the stop codons of these genes are taa codons incompletely encoded in dna with the missing adenine residues added via mrna polyadenylation   <cit> . among other rodent mt genomes, some match the mouse annotation, including the norway rat rattus norvegicus ncbi reference sequence  and the sequence of the sibling vole microtus rossiaemeridionalis , while others conform to the human model, including the golden hamster mesocricetus auratus ncbi reference sequence   and the korean red-backed vole eothenomys regulus . the eastern european house mouse mus musculus musculus  annotation also follows human rather than the house mouse  annotation.fig.  <dig> mixed annotation of the 3′ end of nad <dig> in different mammals. genbank sequences and annotations of the nad <dig> cds  and of trni  are shown for human , mouse  and golden hamster 



in this study, we characterise the mt transcriptome of a cricetid rodent, the eurasian bank vole clethrionomys glarolus. as for other non-human mammals, there is no experimental evidence of the ends of the bank vole mrna molecules and their polyadenylation status. recently, we sequenced and annotated the mt genome of the bank vole based on sanger sequencing   <cit> . here, we utilize illumina rna-seq data collected for two wild-caught individuals to describe the mt transcriptome of the bank vole. although rna-seq data are primarily employed to gather information about nuclear-encoded transcripts, they typically contain a high proportion of reads matching the mt transcripts, potentially extremely useful in mt transcriptome characterization  <cit> . we mapped the bank vole rna-seq reads to the sequence of the mt genome and characterise the 3′ends of the mrnas from the bank vole mt genome. on the basis of this information, we assess the polyadenylation status of mrnas, the codon usage to terminate the translation, and the presence of utrs and igss in the bank vole mtdna.fig.  <dig> the mitochondrial genome of the bank vole. arrows pointing clockwise indicate rrna and protein-coding genes  encoded by the heavy strand and counter-clockwise arrow pcg encoded by the light strand



RESULTS
our mapping strategy allowed the identification of transcript polyadenylation as stretches of three or more adenine residue that do not map back to the genome and lie at the ends of mapped fractions of the reads mapping to the 3′ ends of protein-coding genes   <cit> . locating the poly sites made it possible to determine where the stop codon of pcgs is completed by polyadenylation, including for the genes where a triplet taa, tag or tgt overlaps the first one or two nucleotides of the downstream gene. knowing the location of the poly sites also allowed the identification of the 3′ ends of the transcripts and the search for the presence of utrs and of non-coding igss.fig.  <dig> location of the transcript 3′ ends by rna-seq. the nad <dig> gene is shown here as an example of the way in which reads with poly tails can be mapped with unaligned ends . the transcript polyadenylation sites are identified as stretches of adenine residue that do not map back to the genome and lie at the ends of mapped fractions of the reads . the three reads at the bottom of the mapping match the genomic sequences along their entire length and most likely derive from unprocessed polycistronic transcript



mapping statistics
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired reads were generated for the voles  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. of these  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads  were mapped to the  <dig> -bp-long mt genome , with the average coverage of 5696× and 6248×, respectively. of total mapped reads,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads  mapped to the  <dig> pcgs  in the two voles, respectively. the average coverage of pcgs was 7928× and 8454×, respectively, with the coverage of 100× or higher over 99 % of the nucleotides. the average coverage of each position in the last 100 bp of the pcgs, that is in the region critical for poly detection, ranged from 2580× to 5010× in vole  <dig> and from 3035× to  <dig> × in vole  <dig> fig.  <dig> read mapping to the mitochondrial genome. coverage of the bank vole mtdna by the rna-seq reads  and the distribution of the reads matching the poly 3′ transcript ends . annotation arrows pointing right indicate rna and protein-coding genes  encoded by the heavy strand and left arrows pcg encoded by the light strand. in the top panel, the minimum, mean and maximum coverage values are shown in different shades of blue as calculated using a window size of 100 bp. in the bottom panel, the total number of individual reads that align to the transcript ends are shown, with those between  <dig> and  <dig> displayed by a ladder , with any additional reads between  <dig> and  <dig> displayed as a solid bar 



transcript polyadenylation sites
clear signatures of 3′ end transcript polyadenylation were found for  <dig> of the  <dig> pcgs encoded on the h-strand . the poly stretches started from 0 bp  to 595 bp  downstream of the last dna-encoded nucleotide of the stop codon . a minimum of  <dig> reads with three or more non-template adenine nucleotides at the 3′ end mapped to the putative transcript end of each of these genes . the only exception was the nad <dig> transcript, to which only seven poly end-reads were mapped . for the other genes, the number of poly end-reads was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . these results allowed unambiguous assignment of the location of the poly sites and thus mature transcript ends for each h-strand pcg .fig.  <dig> alignment of rna-seq reads with poly ends to mitochondrial genes. the last three codons and the stop codon are shown for each protein-coding gene  encoded on the heavy strand except for the upstream genes from both bicistronic transcripts . an example poly end-read  is shown aligned to the genomic  sequence. the sequence of the gene located immediately downstream of each pgc is shown over a length corresponding to the unaligned poly end of the read. only the first and last six nucleotides are shown in antisense sequences of the genes contained within the 3′ untranslated regions of cox <dig>  and nad <dig> , with their middle sections represented by ‘xxx’



posttranscriptional stop-codon completion
rather than a complete stop codon in the dna, three of the pcgs  have a solitary t residue before the 5′end of a downstream trna, and in the case of the atp <dig> gene, a ta before the 5′end of the downstream adjacent cox <dig> gene . in all these genes, the poly site was located immediately following the last dna-encoded nucleotide of the stop codon, i.e. t in the case of nad <dig> , cox <dig> and nad <dig>  and a in the case of atp <dig>  therefore, in these four genes a taa stop codon was created by post-transcriptional polyadenylation that changed t or ta residues to the complete taa stop codon . a taa stop codon thus terminates the translation of all mrnas in the bank vole mtdna. the exceptions are nad <dig> and nad <dig> terminating with taa in the vole  <dig>  but with tag in the vole  <dig> 

bicistronic transcripts with overlapping reading frames
no poly end-reads mapped to the 3′ ends of atp <dig>  nad4l and nad <dig>  the reading frames of the two h-strand genes  overlap the reading frames of the respective downstream genes in a tail-to-head manner by 43 bp  and 7 bp  . the reading frame overlap and the absence of a poly tail from the more upstream gene in each pair  most likely mean that in each case the two genes are expressed from the same, bicistronic transcript . this explains the absence of poly tails downstream of the orf of the more upstream gene in each case . it also explains why atp <dig> and nad4l show no drop in coverage observed for the trna genes , which is due to the library enrichment for poly-tailed rna.

exception to the trna punctuation model
there is also no intervening trna sequence between the atp <dig> and cox <dig> genes . the reading frames of neighbouring pcgs in the bank vole mt genome are interrupted with trna genes, with the exception of the two pairs of overlapping genes  and of the atp <dig> and cox <dig> genes, which are attached to each other in a tail-to-head manner . however, unlike the more upstream genes associated with the two bicistronic transcripts , both atp <dig> and cox <dig> transcripts showed clear evidence of polyadenylation , which completed the taa stop codon of both these genes . therefore, the bank vole cox <dig> gene is expressed from a different mature mrna than the atp8/atp <dig> transcript. these transcripts thus represent an apparent exception to the trna punctuation model in that another mechanism needs to be postulated to account for the cleavage site between atp <dig> and cox <dig> 

untranslated and intergenic regions
mature transcripts of six pcgs contained a utr at the 3′ end, defined as the region between the stop codon and the poly site. most 3′ utrs were a single bp  or a few bp  long. however, two monocistronic mrna transcripts contained substantially longer 3′ utrs . first, the cox <dig> transcript contained a 69 bp long 3′utr corresponding to the full antisense sequence of trns followed by 3 bp of igs sequence . second, the 595 bp long nad <dig> 3′utr contained full antisense sequences of nad <dig> and trne , and a 5 bp igs .

the largest igs in the bank vole mt genome, the control region  flanked by trnp and trnf, was 946 bp long in both individuals analysed. the second major igs, 31 bp long in both mitogenomes, was located within a cluster of five trna genes , specifically between trnn and trnc . this region has the capacity to fold into a stable stem-loop secondary structure  and most likely represents the l-strand origin of replication . additionally, there were  <dig> short igss. these igss were from  <dig> to 5 bp long, totalling up to 26 bp and covering  <dig>  % of the bank vole mitogenome, and were identified mostly between pcgs and trna genes or between different trna genes .fig.  <dig> predicted stem-loop structure of the light-strand origin of replication . the free energy of the structure was − <dig>  kcal/mol, as calculated with the clc genomics workbench using the algorithm in  <cit>

discussion
although posttranscriptional modification of mt transcripts plays key roles in complementation of the coding information and in the expression of mtdna-encoded genes, there is little experimental evidence on the polyadenylation status and the location of poly sites in mtdna for mammals other than humans  <cit> . the present study starts to fill this gap by using rna-seq reads derived from poly-enriched bank vole rna to characterise the 3′ ends of the mt transcripts in this species.

the general characteristics of the bank vole mt transcriptome match the human model. all pcgs except one  are transcribed from the h-strand. the h-strand transcriptome consist of ten monocistronic and two bicistronic mrnas. all bank vole transcripts punctuated by trna genes at their 3′ ends are polyadenylated , as found for human mtdna  <cit> . our data demonstrate that the polyadenylation of bank vole mt transcripts occurred precisely at the sites predicted by the trna punctuation model, except for the nad <dig> transcript, whose 3′ end is at an igs/cob boundary . this deviation from the trna punctuation model matches previous findings in humans  <cit> . the two mature bicistronic transcripts correspond to the mrna for atp8/atp <dig> subunits and the mrna for nad4l/nad <dig> subunits, with orfs overlapping by  <dig> and 7 bp, respectively. the expression of these genes from bicistronic units has been demonstrated in humans  <cit> , and although the orfs similarly overlap in mtdna of other mammals  <cit> , only for the bank vole have we provided experimental evidence in support of the existence of mature bicistronic transcripts. this shows that this feature of mtdna transcription is shared by rodents and primates.

our rna-seq data provided no evidence for the location of the 3′ end of the mrna for nad <dig>  this is the only pgc encoded on the l-strand  <cit> . the orfs of bank vole nad <dig> and nad <dig> overlap tail-to-tail for 4 bp and the antisense sequence of nad <dig> is fully contained in the 3′ utr of nad <dig> . however, the bank vole nad <dig> orf is not punctuated by a downstream trna and its mrna does not appear to be stably polyadenylated near the 3′ end of the orf, consistent with human  <cit> . the location of the end of the bank vole nad <dig> transcript therefore remains unknown as does its polyadenylation status. thus, while our approach allowed accurate positioning of the 3′ ends of major transcripts for all h-strand pcgs , rna extracted from enriched mitochondria and/or rt-pcr or deep sequencing strategies specifically targeting transcript ends will be required to describe the ends of the l-strand encoded transcript as well as of rrns and rrnl transcripts, and to test for possible additional minor poly sites  <cit> .

four of the bank vole pcgs  have taa stop codons that are incompletely encoded in the dna and are completed posttranscriptionally by polyadenylation, which is demonstrated by the presence of a poly site immediately downstream of the last dna-encoded stop codon nucleotide . this finding is in concordance with slomovic et al.  <cit>  who found in human cells that polyadenylation is a key step in completion of stop codons only partly encoded by mtdna. stop codons of seven pcgs in human mtdna  require completion by polyadenylation  <cit> . therefore, while the mechanism is shared by the two species, there is heterogeneity in the role of polyadenylation in completion of the coding information of the individual genes between human and the bank vole as some of the genes with incomplete stop codons in human encode full stop codons in the bank vole. for example, while the stop codon of nad <dig> is only partly encoded in the dna  and is posttranscriptionally completed to taa in both species   <cit> , nad <dig> encodes an incomplete stop codon  in human, but a full stop codon in the bank vole , where it is further followed by 2 bp of utr sequence  . the poly site immediately follows this short 3′utr , which demonstrates that the bank vole nad <dig> mrna also fully conforms to the trna punctuation model, but that in this species polyadenylation is not required to complete the stop codon.

in contrast to the evidence from human  <cit>  and bank vole, annotations of various rodent mt genome sequences in genbank  include complete tag stop codons in the cds of both nad <dig> and nad <dig> that overlap the downstream trni and trnw by 2 bp  in each case . such cds/trna overlap would imply a deviation from the trna punctuation model  <cit>  and an alternative rna processing mechanism would need to be postulated. the discordance in nad <dig> and nad <dig> annotation among different species reflects insufficient transcriptome data. we believe that unambiguous determination of stop codons is, in some cases, not possible based solely on genomic sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is a demonstration of how deep rna-seq from total rna was useful to recover mtdna transcriptome data in a non-model rodent species. this approach has previously been applied to study mt gene expression of an insect, including polyadenylation and polycistronic transcripts  <cit> . we show that rna-seq data are helpful in evaluation of gene boundaries, polyadenylation and post-transcriptional modification in mammalian mtdna. even though the structure, genetic content and organization of mtdna are strongly conserved among mammals and human mtdna is considered a paradigm for the whole class  <cit> , it is imperative that sequencing of new mt genomes incorporate evidence from the transcriptome as often as possible, as annotations based on genomic data only are liable to errors. fortunately, typical mammalian whole transcriptome rna-seq data contain a high proportion of reads matching the mt transcripts that remain largely unexplored in most gene expression studies, but which can be extremely useful in mt transcriptome characterization. this includes rna-seq data from published studies that are available in read archives. as smith  <cit>  points out, ‘the bulk of the organelle-derived rna-seq reads in public databases are waiting to be analysed’. therefore, for some species , it should be possible to rectify the situation even with the data that are now available.
