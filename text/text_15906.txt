BACKGROUND
chemotaxis inhibitory protein of staphylococcus aureus  is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil chemotaxis and activation by specifically binding and blocking the g-protein coupled complement fragment c5a receptor  and formylated peptide receptor   <cit> . c5a is a complement polypeptide with many functions. it exerts pro-inflammatory effects through the c5ar and is involved in host defense against microorganisms. the c5a/c5ar interaction mediates immunomodulatory and inflammatory activities such as chemotaxis, degranulation, vascular permeabilisation and cytokine regulation  <cit> . c5a plays a role in a wide variety of inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune complex disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury and sepsis  <cit> . since c5a is generated early in the inflammatory cascade it is a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapy. several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of targeting the c5ar in inflammatory diseases  <cit> .

the potent ability of chips to inhibit activation of the c5ar is an important asset which might be useful for development of a potential new anti-inflammatory drug. however, since the chips gene is present in over 60% of staphylococcus aureus strains and s. aureus is a common bacterium, a majority of the population encounters chips early in life. human serum contains anti-chips antibodies that have been shown to interfere with chips function in vitro  <cit> . these antibodies may therefore neutralize the in vivo effect of chips or give rise to antibody mediated immune reactions. as such, the potential of chips to function as an anti-inflammatory molecule is hampered. an improved chips molecule will be characterized by decreased reactivity with pre-existing antibodies, but preserved c5ar blocking activity. mapping the epitopes of human igg on the chips protein is an important step in the understanding of how antibodies interfere with chips.

antibody screening of phage-displayed peptide libraries is a useful approach to identify antibody epitopes  <cit> . previous studies showed the potential of using random peptide phage libraries in identifying linear epitopes and conformational epitopes for monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. for example, luzzago et al. identified discontinuous epitopes in human h-subunit ferritin by the use of phage display and verified the potential epitopes by design of variants with point mutations  <cit> . rowley et al. studied autoantibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis and could predict the major conformational antibody epitope using phage display and the known nmr structure of the target protein  <cit> . these studies show that peptides expressed by phage display are capable of adopting a conformation that mimics the epitopes.

in this paper we focus on mapping epitopes on chips by panning of phages displaying 7-mer peptides against polyclonal human igg affinity-purified on n- and c-terminally truncated chips. peptides selected by phage display could be grouped into two distinct groups based on their sequence. these were then verified in elisa and by the use of a synthetic peptide. by mapping the selected peptide sequences on the chips surface using the known nmr structure of chips31– <dig>  <cit> , potential conformational epitopes for human igg could be identified. the epitopes were subsequently verified by mutation of key amino acids in the chips molecule and the activity of the mutants was studied by c5ar inhibition. the mutational analysis of the epitopes revealed amino acid residues that are important for the interaction of chips with human antibodies. in addition, amino acids involved in the interaction with the c5ar were identified.

RESULTS
truncated chips variants inhibit c5a induced cell activation
in order to isolate a small active chips variant able to form a functional molecule with decreased number of antibody epitopes, we generated truncated variants of chips. previously, we described chips with n-terminal truncation   <cit>  and chips with both n- and c-terminal truncations   <cit>  that showed a complete preservation of c5ar blocking activity. figure  <dig> summarizes the activity of different chips variants  chips1– <dig>  hence, the smallest chips variant tested, a molecule with preserved biological activity with truncations in both the n- and c-terminal end  was used for further studies. this chips variant has most likely lost the ability to block activation of the fpr, since the n-terminal amino acids of chips are required for that action  <cit> .

affinity-purified anti-chips antibodies recognize non-linear epitopes
in order to map antibody epitopes on chips, affinity purification of human anti-chips igg was initially performed on the wt chips1– <dig> protein. pooled human igg  was affinity-purified using a column packed with immobilized chips1– <dig> resin. we tested the binding of affinity-purified anti-chips1– <dig> antibodies to a set of chips derived 25-mer peptides spanning the complete chips1– <dig> sequence. as shown in figure 2a, linear epitopes do appear to be confined to the n-terminus of chips. to confirm the presence of conformational epitopes, we tested the reactivity of two different affinity-purified antibody preparations  to wt chips1– <dig>  chips Δn and chips Δn/c. figure 2b–d shows that both preparations of affinity isolated antibodies react with all three chips variants. there is no significant difference in reactivity towards the different chips variants between the preparations. reactivity of the different chips variants with the control antibody 2g <dig>  was also comparable, indicating that all chips variants coated equally well. these data also imply that epitopes outside the n-terminus may be of importance for antibody binding and that some of these epitopes are conformational.

panning experiments identified potential antibody recognition sequences
to obtain peptides mimicking epitopes other than the linear epitopes found in the n-terminus of chips, two random peptide phage libraries were screened for binding to anti-chips Δn/c igg. the starting material was a mixture of two different libraries . after four rounds of panning,  <dig> recombinant phage clones were randomly selected and characterized by dna sequencing. the sequence 'mnktwyp' occurred  <dig> times among the sequenced clones and was thereby the most abundant followed by 'mnktfwf' which was selected five times. a majority of the selected peptides  could be divided into two different groups based on their amino acid sequence as shown in table  <dig>  amino acids that occurred most frequently among the aligned sequences for each group were classified as consensus residues.  <dig> sequences belonged to the first group and their consensus sequence was defined as 'mnkt/sxxx'. six sequences with the consensus sequence 'gklpxxx' belonged to the second group. although we started out with a mixture of two different libraries  with linear and circular peptides displayed, respectively, the selected sequences were all originating from the phd- <dig> library with linear sequences. six different recombinant phages expressing representative peptide sequences were characterized in elisa for binding to human anti-chips Δn/c igg. these phages bound specifically to the antibodies and not to bsa . we therefore conclude that the binding of the selected phages to affinity-purified human anti-chips Δn/c igg is specific for the expressed peptide.

* a consensus sequence for each group was determined and is shown in bold. the frequency of each peptide is shown in parenthesis.

synthetic peptides can be used to purify chips specific antibodies
to investigate the specificity of antibodies purified on the selected peptides, a synthetic peptide from the group  <dig> consensus sequence  was synthesized. as the n-terminus of chips was shown to contain linear epitopes for human antibodies, a n-terminal peptide  of chips was used for comparison. the synthesized peptides were designed to contain a c-terminal cysteine residue that allowed immobilization by thiol coupling chemistry. they were subsequently coupled to activated sepharose to create affinity columns, which were used to capture peptide-specific antibodies from the human polyclonal igg pool . binding of the affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies to the chips1– <dig> molecule was studied by elisa and surface plasmon resonance  . the affinity-purified anti-group  <dig> peptide antibodies, the anti-chips Δn/c antibodies as well as affinity-purified anti-1– <dig> peptide antibodies were found to bind to the native chips1– <dig> protein in elisa and spr. preincubation with chips1– <dig> abolished this binding. without affinity purification, the same concentration of iv-igg showed no detectable binding.

potential antibody epitopes were identified on the chips surface
to identify potential antibody epitopes, the consensus sequences 'mnkt/sxxx' and 'gklpxxx', were manually mapped onto the surface of chips31– <dig> by structural analysis. the fold of n-terminally truncated chips consists of an n-terminal amphipathic α-helix and a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet as determined by multi-dimensional nmr  <cit> . the structure of chips with c-terminal truncation is not yet determined, consequently the available nmr structure was used for mapping of the epitopes. more specifically, the suggested epitopes are composed of adjacent amino acids found in the 3d structure .

in total, seven different mapping possibilities of the two consensus sequences were identified. these are denoted surface  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig>  . residue-residue distances between cα, cβ or the closest side chain atoms of the epitope were measured to verify that the amino acids building up the proposed epitopes were adjacent .

surfaces  <dig> – <dig>  are based on the group  <dig> consensus sequence and are largely overlapping, differing only in one or two amino acids . surface  <dig>  and  <dig>  are also based on the group  <dig> consensus sequence, but they are situated in a different part of the protein and are composed of different amino acids. only one mapping possibility was found for the group  <dig> consensus sequence. this potential epitope  was situated on the opposite side of the chips molecule as compared to surfaces  <dig> – <dig> .

verification of proposed surfaces by mutational analysis
in an attempt to verify the proposed surfaces and their relation to antibody epitopes, a mutational strategy was applied. to produce mutants with key amino acids altered, point mutations  were introduced into the c-terminally truncated chips sequence. the specific amino acid substitutions were designed to alter the suggested epitopes by substituting key amino acids to residues with different chemical properties or size. in addition, the specific amino acid substitutions were also chosen in a way not to destabilize the protein. hence, similar amino acids have been substituted to different amino acid types depending on their location in the protein. however, not all amino acids were suitable for mutagenesis, as they were predicted to be important for preserving the structure of chips. these amino acids, r <dig>  <cit>  as well as y <dig>  l <dig> and y <dig> , were therefore left unchanged.

the chips mutants were characterized in a chips capture elisa for decreased binding of human anti-chips Δn/c igg  by making full titration curves of the mutants. the cut-off value for decreased binding was set to 90% of maximum binding of the wt c-terminally truncated chips binding curve.  <dig> out of the  <dig> mutants showed a decreased reactivity with human anti-chips Δn/c igg and are marked in bold in table  <dig>  each of the seven mapped surfaces, defining potential conformational epitopes in chips, involved one to three residues that one by one were important for antibody binding. residues k <dig>  s <dig> and n <dig> were found to be involved in three suggested epitopes  . other amino acids found to be important for antibody binding were n <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  y <dig> and n <dig>  k <dig> was represented in both surface  <dig>  and  <dig> , whilst the other residues were only represented in one of the proposed surfaces.

* the suggested epitopes are denoted surface  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> .

binding of anti-chips Δn/c igg to chips variants was determined by elisa and is shown as % binding to anti-chips Δn/c igg in the table. nine unique chips variants with a maximum binding lower than 90% of wt chips were found. these are marked in bold and were selected for further characterizations. in some positions no substitutions were made. this is marked by -.

new chips variants can still block activation of the c5ar
to investigate whether the selected new chips variants with reduced antibody binding were still functional in preventing c5a induced activation of the c5ar, the  <dig> mutants were purified and analyzed in a calcium flux assay. serial dilutions of the variants were preincubated with fluo-3am labeled u937/c5ar cells and the cells were stimulated with  <dig> nm c5a. flow cytometry data showed that mutants n55k, n68a, k69t, k92e and n111k retained full c5ar blocking activity at  <dig> μg/ml. in contrast, y97k completely abolished and k95s, k100a and s107n partially abolished the biological activity in comparison to wt c-terminally truncated chips . thus, some mutations that interfere with antibody binding are not compatible with biological function.

structural comparisons using circular dichroism spectroscopy 
the k95s, y97k, k100a and s107n mutants showed reduced c5ar blocking activity. in order to ascertain if this reduced activity was due to mutation of c5ar contacting residues and not major conformational changes compared to the structure of the corresponding wt, cd spectra for the new chips variants were investigated. even spectra of variants with decreased biological activity showed a significant absorption minimum at  <dig> nm similar to the corresponding wt. these introduced mutations consequently are unlikely to have affected the global fold of the molecule .

discussion
antibodies often react with tertiary structures formed through protein folding. in contrast to linear epitopes, these epitopes are formed when remote amino acids in the primary sequence of a protein are brought into close proximity in the folded protein, hence they are referred to as discontinuous or conformational epitopes. antibody screening of phage-displayed peptide libraries is an efficient method to identify both linear and conformational epitopes  <cit> . epitopes have been revealed both for monoclonal  <cit>  and polyclonal antibodies  <cit> . in this study, we used two phage-displayed random peptide libraries to map the epitopes for polyclonal human anti-chips Δn/c igg on chips. phage selection depends on many factors, for instance, arginines in the displayed peptide sequence interfere with secretion of the coat protein piii and consequently clones with peptides containing arginines are strongly selected against  <cit> . furthermore, the stringency and nature of the wash steps can favor certain phages  <cit> . to increase the specificity of selected phages for binding to chips igg, we used competition elution with a high concentration of chips in the last round of selection.

peptides found to be involved in human anti-chips Δn/c igg binding all originated from the phage library which expressed linear peptides, and not from the library with cyclic peptides. we speculate that linear peptides might have been favorable in these selections since they may be able to adopt more conformations than the more rigid cyclic peptides. mapping of the linear peptides obtained from phage selections with anti-chips Δn/c igg identified seven potential epitope surfaces, out of which six represent conformational epitopes. this is in accordance with the result from the pepscan elisa, where mainly peptides spanning the n-terminal part of chips were recognized by anti-chips igg. antibody binding to chips is thus likely to be a combination of interaction with conformational and linear epitopes.

the interaction between an antibody and its epitope is dependent on several amino acid residues  <cit> . the nature of the amino acid substituted in a mutagenesis study can affect the ability to detect its involvement in the investigated epitope  <cit> . here, we have substituted residues of the suggested epitopes by amino acids with different characteristics in an effort to detect the epitopes recognized by polyclonal anti-chips Δn/c igg. furthermore, single mutations are likely to affect the binding of only a fraction of all antibodies in a polyclonal preparation. therefore, the effect of site-directed mutagenesis of a single residue may be difficult to detect by elisa, as was found in this study. if the mutations mediating an effect on antibody binding were combined in one sequence they may have a synergistic effect to further decrease the antibody interaction with chips.

nevertheless, we were able to identify amino acid residues important for antibody interaction. by mutagenesis of residues in the different proposed surfaces, we retrieved information on which of the suggested surfaces were likely to be true epitopes. surface  <dig>  and  <dig>  are the surfaces affected most by the mutagenesis. for surface  <dig> , mutagenesis in three out of three positions resulted in lower interaction with the igg. n <dig> in the loop between the α-helix and β <dig>  k <dig> in the β <dig> sheet and s <dig> located in the short loop between β <dig> and β <dig> were all shown to be involved in antibody interaction. surface  <dig>  contains two amino acids  that upon mutagenesis reduced the antibody binding to less than 50%, respectively. n <dig>  located in a well defined long loop between the β <dig> and β <dig> strands, was also shown to contribute to antibody binding. surface  <dig> – <dig>  are overlapping structures. surface  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were considered less likely to be true epitopes since mutagenesis of amino acids t <dig> in surface  <dig>  and  <dig> , q <dig> in  <dig>  as well as t <dig> and k <dig> in  <dig>  did not affect the binding to the igg. surface  <dig>  was another alternative epitope originating from the group  <dig> consensus sequence. this was the only linear epitope suggested, but the relevance of this surface was difficult to verify, since two of the five proposed residues  were not mutated. g <dig> and y <dig> were considered important for maintaining the structure and were not mutated for stability reasons. surface  <dig>  was the only mapping possibility found for the group  <dig> consensus sequence. we consider this to be a less likely epitope, since mutagenesis of its amino acids did not reduce the antibody binding to a similar extent as that observed for  <dig>  or  <dig> .

during the mutational analysis for verification of antibody epitopes, amino acids involved in the interaction with the c5ar were also identified. the β <dig> sheet is comprised of amino acids y94-k <dig> and is most likely critical for binding to the c5ar since we show that substitutions k95s, y97k and k100a as well as s107n affect the c5ar inhibiting activity of chips, while leaving the chips structure intact. these data confirm previous findings where the substitution k95a was implicated in c5ar blocking activity  <cit> . some of the amino acid residues found to be important for the antibody interaction are therefore also most likely important for the receptor binding properties of chips. this corroborates data from wright et al. who recently showed that chips-specific antibodies from human serum could inhibit the binding and activity of chips to the c5ar  <cit> .

the data about which amino acids are involved in c5ar binding is a finding that may be utilized in the design of an optimal chips molecule that requires retained c5ar binding and blocking in addition to minimal binding of human antibodies. our study suggests residues that must be left untouched or substituted in a more conservative manner. for certain applications, there may also be other aspects to consider, such as analysis of the presence of t-cell epitopes. such a process can be added in future studies when designing new chips variants.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, selection of peptide displaying phage libraries using a pool of chips specific polyclonal human igg resulted in the identification of peptide sequences that were mapped onto the chips surface to form conformational antibody epitopes. these were verified by mutational analysis and at least two epitopes likely to be true epitopes were characterized. amino acids important for c5ar binding within these epitopes were also identified by the mutagenesis. the mapping of human antibody epitopes on chips is a step towards the development of an improved chips molecule. such a c5ar antagonist with low interaction with human igg would potentially be an effective anti-inflammatory agent.
