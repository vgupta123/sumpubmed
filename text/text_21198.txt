BACKGROUND
serine proteases  in the s <dig> family are involved in physiological processes including digestion, development and defense  <cit> . x-ray crystallography studies show that the active center of bovine chymotrypsin is ser <dig>  his <dig>  and asp <dig>  <cit> . a substrate binding cleft near the active site is the predominant factor in determining sp substrate specificity. sps are divided into several types, including the trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, based on the target scissile bond. sps are usually produced as zymogens. sp zymogens are sequentially activated in a cascade pathway, with a classic example being the blood clotting cascade and complement system in mammalian plasma. serine protease homologs  are similar to sps in amino acid sequence, but they have no protease activity because of losing one or more of the catalytic residue  <cit> . in insects, sphs participate in the innate immune response  <cit> .

genome-wide analysis has been performed for sps and sphs in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . immunity-related sps and sphs have been investigated in anopheles gambiae and apis mellifera  <cit> . however, little is known about these proteins in the silkworm, even though its sps and sphs are involved in biological processes that include digestion, development and immune response  <cit> . tanaka et al. identified potential immunity-related silkworm sps and sphs  <cit> , but their roles require further investigation. changes in mrna level during immune response are considered evidence that a gene is involved in an immune process. in this paper, we report the genome-wide classification, distribution and expression profiling of b.mori sps and sphs based on the silkworm genome and microarray data  <cit> . the role of sp and sph genes in immunity has aslo been investigated. the results are expected to stimulate in-depth analysis of silkworm sps and sphs.

RESULTS
identification and chromosome distribution of silkworm sp and sph genes
sp and sph genes from manduca sexta and other insects were used to search the silkworm genomic sequence, which revealed  <dig> serine protease genes. analysis of active sites showed that  <dig> serine protease genes have the three active site residues intact . the rest  <dig> serine protease genes had mutations in the catalytic residues , so they may have lost catalytic function . compared to  <dig> sp genes and  <dig> sph genes in drosophila, silkworm has  <dig> fewer sp genes and  <dig> more sph genes. the genes were named bmsp1-bmsp <dig> ,  <dig> of which had previously been submitted to genbank, including ovarian serine protease , cocoonase , vitellin-degrading protease precursor , and alkaliphilic serine protease p-iic  , which function in digestion, ovary and embryo development, and formation of fibroin. the remaining  <dig> genes were not reported previously. the genes reported here represent the first catalog of silkworm sp and sph genes. approximately  <dig>  were found to be expressed using expressed sequence tag  data according to stringent criteria . the molecular weights and isoelectric points of silkworm sps and sphs were widely distributed. predicted molecular weights were  <dig>  kda- <dig>  kda, and predicted isoelectric points were  <dig> - <dig> .

in arthropods, clip-domain serine proteases and homologs  mediate innate immunity and embryonic development  <cit> , and are involved in signal-amplifying reactions  <cit> . previously, these proteases had been found only in invertebrates. we identified  <dig> clip-sps and  <dig> clip-sphs in the silkworm  <cit>  , which are consisted of a chymotrypsin-like sp domain, and one or more clip domain at the n-terminus. the sp domain amplies signals by cleaving and activating a downstream sp  <cit> . activation of the toll pathway and melanization mediated by sp cascades are the major defense mechanisms in insects  <cit> .

the updated silkworm genome has  <dig> sp and sph genes  on  <dig> chromosomes, with an uneven distribution. for example, chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> have no sp and sph genes, while both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have one. however, chromosome  <dig> has  <dig> genes, chromosome  <dig> has  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> has  <dig> . additional analysis showed that sp and sph genes exhibit a tandem repeat distribution on the chromosomes. for example, there are  <dig> genes in nscaf <dig> of chromosome  <dig>  and bmsp <dig>  bmsph <dig>  bmsph <dig>  bmsp <dig> and bmsph <dig> showed tandem repeat distribution on this chromosome . of these, bmsph <dig> and bmsp <dig> were closely linked. the distance between the two genes is only  <dig> kb, and their sequence identities were up to 96%. therefore, these genes probably arose by gene duplication.

species-specific sp and sph genes in the silkworm
the tribe-mcl clustering algorithm was used to group the sp and sph genes into families. caenorhabditis elegans, homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster, apis mellifera and anopheles gambiae were included to find members of evolutionarily conserved families, which were defined as containing silkworm genes, and at least one gene in another species. the results uncovered  <dig> sp and sph silkworm genes, belonging to  <dig> gene families,  <dig> of which were evolutionally conserved . sp_fam <dig> contains the most number of sp and sph genes. these exist in c. elegans, insects and humans, indicating that sp_fam <dig> existed before the divergence of these species. sp_fam <dig> has two members in c. elegans, and shows great expansion in insects and mammals. b. mori and a. mellifera contain  <dig> and  <dig> members of sp_fam <dig>  respectively. however, the diptera insects d. melanogaster and a. gambiae, have  <dig> and  <dig> sp_fam <dig> members, respectively. interestingly, the other  <dig> evolutionarily conserved sp and sph gene families are insect-specific.

the silkworm genome contains  <dig> genes in  <dig> silkworm-specific sp and sph gene families . if the  <dig> singleton sp genes are considered,  <dig> species-specific sp and sph genes exist, accounting for  <dig> % of the silkworm sp and sph genes. this indicated that the genes that came from the same species-specific sp and sph gene families were the result of tandem repeats . for example, sp_fam <dig> has  <dig> members, and  <dig> occur as tandem repeats on chromosome  <dig>  internal members of the same family showed tandem repeat distribution in sp_fam <dig> , sp_fam <dig> , sp_fam <dig>  and sp_fam <dig> . thus, tandem repeat distribution has an important effect on the expansion of species-specific sp and sph genes in silkworm. in fact, silkworm genome analysis shows that many silkworm-specific gene families have the typical features of a chromosomal tandem repeat distribution  <cit> . in addition, gene sequences in the same cluster show high identity. for example, the chromosomal location of bmsph <dig> and bmsph <dig> is a typical tandem repeat, with the genes closely linked on the chromosome, only  <dig> kb apart, and sequence identity of up to 96%. this indicated that one of the genes may have emerged from the duplication of the other, and the duplication event happened recently. therefore, these specific genes may come from a specific gene duplication family. genes that originated by duplication might have adapted during silkworm evolution and may cut substrates specific to silkworm. however, this hypothesis need to be valitated by further experiments.

expression profile of silkworm sp and sph genes
microarray analysis showed that  <dig> sp and sph genes have transcriptional activity in at least one tissue or organ according to a stringent criterion for definition of expressed genes  <cit> . midgut had the highest number  of expressed genes among the  <dig> tissues or organs, while the number of expressed genes in testis, ovary, head, integument, fat body, hemocytes, malpighian tubule, a/msg and psg was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . further analysis reveals that most of genes expressed highly and exclusively in the midgut belong to silkworm-specific families, such as sp_fam <dig>  sp_fam <dig>  sp_fam <dig> and sp_fam <dig>  these gene families showed unique midgut expression feature that are likely to reflect the special food habit of silkworm, and the process of accumulating abundant amino acids for producing silk. it may also be associated with resistance with pathogenic microorganisms. some genes had unique expression features in other tissues on the third day of the silkworm fifth instar larva according to microarray analysis, for example, exclusive expression was seen for bmsp <dig> in the head, bmsph <dig> in the testis, and bmsph <dig> in the ovaries. semi-quantitative rt-pcr was also performed to confirm tissue expression patterns of some representative sp and sph genes for day- <dig> fifth instar larvae. the results were the same as those for the microarray data .

more than  <dig> genes are expressed exclusively at the fifth instar larval stage, and about  <dig> genes are expressed highly over the entire metamorphosis process . the majority of sp and sph genes express in both male and female silkworms. however, a group of sph genes show differences in expression between males and females during the metamorphosis in which a pupa turns into an adult. these genes express highly and exclusively in males, but are minimally expressed in females during metamorphosis .

we analyzed the expression pattern of repeated genes using information on gene location and expression data from tissue microarray experiments, and found that repeated sp and sph gene groups in silkworm do not have identical expression patterns. for example, the repeated gene group on chr. <dig> includes several genes, but only bmsp <dig> and bmsp <dig> have a similar expression pattern. of  <dig> sp and sph genes expressed exclusively in the midgut, only bmsp <dig> and bmsp <dig> are tandem repeat genes, with too much distance between the other genes , although some were located on the same chromosome, such as bmsph <dig>  bmsph <dig>  bmsph <dig> and bmsph <dig> on chr.7; bmsph <dig>  bmsp <dig>  bmsph <dig> and bmsph <dig> on chr.18; bms <dig>  bms <dig> and bmsph <dig> on chr.16; and bmsp <dig> and bmsp <dig> on chr. <dig>  these results were confirmed by developmental expression patterns 

to investigate whether silkworm sp genes are involved in the immune response, sp and sph expression changes were analyzed after insects infected by four different microorganisms. we found that expression of  <dig> sp and sph genes could be detected. among these,  <dig> were up-regulated more than  <dig>  times in the infected group compared to the control group . most were up-regulated most strongly during the late stage,  <dig> hours after infection. for example, bmsp <dig> expression was up to  <dig> times higher than the control at  <dig> hours after e. coli infection, and twice as high as the 24-h point for bacillus bombysepticus or batrytis bassiana infection. expression of bmsph <dig> exceeded  <dig>  times the control after infection with any of the four microorganisms. a few genes showed expression regulation that was different, depending on the infecting microorganism. for example, bmsph <dig> was up-regulated after infection with e.coli, b.bombyspticus or b. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus , but did not change significantly after infection with b.bassiana. however, when we compared the magnitude in induction of gene expression between antibacterial proteins bmcecropinb and silkworm sp or sph genes, we found that bmcecropinb was remarkably upregulated on infection by these four pathogens at all time points except for bmnpv infection at  <dig> h . the induced expression pattern was consistent with sp or sph genes at most of the time points. the data suggest that sp or sph genes might play important roles in the innate immune system of b. mori. the gene expression results from microarray experiments were validated by real-time quantitative rt-pcr . the results are consistent with the microarray experiments. only  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated genes were in genbank, specifically bmsph <dig> , bmsp <dig>  and bmsp <dig>  .of  <dig> up-regulated sps and sphs, bmsp <dig> has two clip domains, while bmsph <dig> has one clip domain . although the function of clip domains is not yet clear, enzymes that contain this structure are of interest, because they may regulate serine protease activity and mediate innate immunity  <cit> .

sps involved in cascade regulation of the insect immune response were found to be highly conserved. broehan found that chymotrypsin-like protease cascade systems that contain ctlp <dig> control chitin synthase activity in the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta  <cit> . the chitin portion of the peritrophic matrix in the midgut plays an important role in resistance to pathogenic bacteria and toxins. bmsph <dig> has 70% identity to clip  <dig> , and like clip  <dig>  bmsph <dig> was also expressed in the midgut, so it may have a similar function. the melanism reaction in insects is mediated by an sp signalling cascade that is highly conserved. in the m. sexta sp signalling cascade, prohp <dig> is a pattern recognition protein that binds to bacteria and autoactivates and triggers the prophenoloxidase activation system in the hemolymph, which contains a series of proteinases such as hp <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  finally prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase  are activated, leading to the melanism reaction  <cit> . cytotoxic molecules are produced in this process, including quinones and reactive oxygen intermediates, that may kill the invading microorganisms that are trapped by the melanin  <cit> . bmsp <dig>  bmsph <dig> and bmsph <dig> in the silkworm are highly similar to hp <dig>  hp <dig> and pap, respectively, in the tobacco hornworm . bmsp <dig>  bmsph <dig> and bmsph <dig> were markedly up-regulated after induction, suggesting that they may have similar functions to their tobacco hornworm homologs .

CONCLUSIONS
from the updated b. mori silkworm genome, we identified sp and sph genes and analyzed their expression patterns. comparative genomics showed that sp and sph genes belong to a large family whose members were generated mainly by duplication and show a lineage of tandem chromosomal repeats. in addition, we found that silkworm has species-specific sp and sph genes, and combining the results of express profiles, we hypothesize that members of the silkworm sp and sph families may participate in biological processes that include digestion, development and the immune response. we hope the data presented in this study facilitates functional studies on sps and sphs in b. mori.
