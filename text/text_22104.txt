BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a disease with considerable human mortality and morbidity in the tropics  <cit> . clinical presentation of melioidosis varies from rapidly fatal septicemia and acute pneumonia, chronic or localized abscess formation to skin and soft tissue infections that progress rapidly to systemic infection  <cit> . treatment of melioidosis involves long periods of antibiotic administration which are vital to eliminate b. pseudomallei and to prevent relapse  <cit> .

several features of melioidosis suggest that b. pseudomallei is a facultative intracellular bacterium. these include long incubation periods of up to 62 years and the tendency to relapse  <cit> . b. pseudomallei has the ability to survive and proliferate within phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells  <cit> , and free-living amoeba  <cit>  for months or years. the exact mechanism of invasion is still unknown, but it requires the rearrangement of host actin cytoskeleton and the involvement of bope, an effector protein of the type iii secretion system   <cit> . after cellular uptake, b. pseudomallei escapes from endocytic vacuoles and once in the cytoplasm, induces host cell fusion and enters neighbouring cells by forming actin tails and membrane protrusions  <cit> . vacuole escape and intracellular survival requires a functional t3ss- <dig>  as mutants of t3ss- <dig> display delayed vacuolar escape, reduced actin formation and reduced capacity to survive intracellularly and spread to neighbouring cells  <cit> . it is possible that intracellular survival and intercellular spread may provide b. pseudomallei protection from host defences.

recently, the type vi secretion cluster tss- <dig>  was shown to contribute to intracellular growth of b. pseudomallei <cit> . the expression of this secretion system is dependent on the sensor regulators bprc and vira-virg . the type vi secretion system is also thought to play a major role during bacterial transition from the phagosome to the cytosol  <cit> . moreover, t6ss is also implicated in other important bacterial pathogens as the key virulence factor and is involved in translocation of effector proteins into eukaryotic cells  <cit> . using in vivo expression technology, shalom et al.  <cit>  found that the b. pseudomallei tss- <dig> gene cluster was induced inside murine macrophages. furthermore, pilatz and colleagues demonstrated that a b. pseudomallei tss- <dig> transposon mutant displayed reduced ability to form plaques on ptk <dig> epithelial cell monolayers, indicating the requirement of tss- <dig> in cell-to-cell spread  <cit> . this mutant was also highly attenuated in mice with reduced bacterial load in the spleen, liver and lung at  <dig> h post-infection  <cit> .

previous studies have examined the detailed cellular responses of b. pseudomallei within eukaryotic cells. however, the overall picture of the mechanisms involved in adaptability to the intracellular lifestyle is still unclear. the availability of the complete genome sequence for b. pseudomallei <cit>  enabled us to design a whole genome dna microarray to identify b. pseudomallei genes regulated during infection of macrophages. these data provide an insight into genes involved in survival and adaptation of the bacteria within macrophage cells as well as a new understanding of the biology of host-pathogen interaction during melioidosis.

RESULTS
infection model and bacterial rna isolation
human macrophage-like u <dig> cells were chosen as the infection model as it has previously been used extensively to study b. pseudomallei interaction with host cells  <cit> . in this study, bacterial replication within macrophages was observed with a maximum cfu obtained at  <dig> h post-infection. the calculated doubling time for intracellular b. pseudomallei is about  <dig>  h, indicating a slower growth rate compared to the control bacteria in rpmi . the number of viable bacteria decreased consistently after 6 h post-infection and a 2-log reduction in viable cells was noted with prolonged incubation of up to 24 h. a similar decline in bacterial numbers following prolonged incubation was previously reported in raw <dig>  cells  <cit> . viability of infected u <dig> cells decreased over time and was drastically reduced by 6 h post-infection, suggesting a cytotoxic effect of b. pseudomallei on the host cells .

an ultrastructural study of infected u <dig> cells showed that the nuclei, mitochondria and vacuoles were swollen whilst the nuclear material appeared diluted and the cell membrane totally disrupted . all these changes indicate that infected u <dig> cells displayed a phenotype similar to oncotic cells as previously observed in other cells infected with b. pseudomallei <cit> . loss of phagosome membrane in b. pseudomallei infected macrophage cells was established as early as 15 min post-incubation similar to that previously reported  <cit> . at 2 h post-infection, loss of phagosome membrane is evident and bacilli were seen in the cytoplasm . moreover, replication of intracellular bacteria was seen in the cytoplasm of host cells .

an infection period of  <dig> to 6 h was selected to study changes in the expression profile as more than 85 % of the infected u <dig> cells were still viable during this period . this would ensure maximum recovery of intracellular b. pseudomallei from viable cells to obtain sufficient intact bacterial rna. we adopted the differential lysis method with saponin to prevent bacterial cell lysis and easily recover bacterial rna. this strategy enriches the bacterial mrna several thousand-fold  <cit> . treatment with saponin specifically lyses eukaryotic cells without affecting bacterial viability  <cit>  and in our study, the use of  <dig>  % to 4 % saponin was not detrimental to b. pseudomallei . differential centrifugation was combined with this method to efficiently remove host cellular debris. based on the rna integrity number  and the 16 s/23 s rrna subunit ratio, the electrophoretic profiles of the total rna extracted from intracellular bacteria showed no evidence of degradation and only minor host rna contamination was detectable .

the global gene expression profile
temporal gene expression profiles obtained from intracellular b. pseudomallei were compared with the transcriptome of control bacteria grown in cell culture medium. statistical analysis  combined with a 2-fold variation cut off indicated that  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed at 1 h,  <dig>  at 2 h,  <dig>  at 4 h and  <dig>  genes at 6 h. hierarchical clustering of gene expression levels revealed similar patterns of gene regulation over the period of infection . the majority of the genes with altered expression were down-regulated throughout the infection period compared to bacteria grown in control medium. expression levels of these genes continued to decrease up to 4 h before increasing to levels lower or similar to control bacteria at 6 h. it appears that the adaptation of b. pseudomallei within u <dig> cells is rapid and most of the changes occurred as early as 1 h post-infection . with time, the number of significantly deregulated genes gradually decreased, suggesting that b. pseudomallei had become adapted to the intracellular environment. functional classification of intracellularly modulated bacterial genes at each time point showed that most of these genes encoded core functions such as metabolism, cell envelope, regulatory functions, transport and binding. many genes encoding proteins with unknown function or hypothetical proteins were also modulated during infection .

of the  <dig>  probes represented on our microarrays,  <dig>  transcripts representing  <dig>  % of the b. pseudomallei orfeome, were differentially expressed during the infection time course. of these,  <dig> genes demonstrated increased expression  while  <dig>  genes were down-regulated . we performed gene function enrichment analysis on these genes to further categorize them into biological functions. based on the statistical analysis of kegg biochemical pathways, the number of genes involved in cellular functions such as biosynthesis of flagella and capsule, energy metabolism and regulatory systems was significantly higher during intracellular infection .

note: * genes selected for real-time qpcr analysis.

as an independent measure of differential gene expression, we examined the relative expression of six up- or down-regulated genes selected from different functional categories by real-time qpcr  on the same samples as those used for microarray analysis. changes in expression were verified by real-time qpcr with a correlation of > <dig>  to the microarray data . the strong correlation observed verified the efficiency and robustness of the designed microarray for high throughput screening of the b. pseudomallei transcriptome.

due to the large number of significantly differentiated genes modulated during the infection, only data related to genes that have some functional information are shown and discussed below. the identified genes are discussed according to functional categories.

intracellular metabolism and ion transport
in host-pathogen interactions, sufficient nutrition levels are necessary for the successful survival of the pathogen. once intracellular, the bacteria must make metabolic adjustments to adapt to changes in nutrient availability. we noted a robust shutdown in the expression of b. pseudomallei genes involved in metabolism. genes involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were consistently down-regulated in intracellular b. pseudomallei. in addition, most genes involved in energy metabolism such as atp synthase and nadh dehydrogenase were down-regulated . collectively, these data suggest that intracellular b. pseudomallei have lower energy requirements and limit their energy production during the initial stage of infection. several anaerobic metabolism genes were induced in intracellular b. pseudomallei. anaerobic metabolism pathway genes such as bpss <dig> , bpsl <dig>  and bpss <dig>  were up-regulated throughout the infection period. nevertheless, none of the components of the anaerobic respiratory chain showed significant changes in expression except for bpsl <dig>  and bpsl <dig>  that were induced at the early stage of infection.

other induced genes were catac genes, which are involved in benzoate degradation, indicating that intracellular b. pseudomallei utilized aromatic compounds as a source of carbon. increased expression of phenylacetic acid  pathway genes at the later stage of infection  was also observed . the major nitrogen source in the intracellular compartment is most likely methylamine and purine as suggested by the increased expression of methylamine utilization protein  and allantoicase . allantoicase is involved in purine metabolism and provides a secondary nitrogen source under nitrogen limiting conditions  <cit> .

expression of virulence and virulence-associated factors
we observed the repression of genes encoding proteins that are well characterised as b. pseudomallei virulence factors. these include the main capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis  genes, two potential surface polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters , majority of genes in the lipopolysaccharide  biosynthesis cluster and genes encoding for flagella assembly and chemotaxis. we also noted the repression of bspr, a regulator recently shown to control the expression of tt3ss- <dig> genes  <cit> . the inhibition of this regulator leads to the reduced expression of t3ss- <dig> controlled genes in intracellular b. pseudomallei.

one of the six clusters of the type vi secretion system, the tss- <dig> cluster , was up-regulated up to 182-fold during intracellular infection . this observation is consistent with previous reports on the induction of three genes in this cluster, tssh-5tssi- <dig> and tssm- <dig>  upon invasion of macrophages  <cit> . we also observed the induction of genes flanking the tss- <dig> cluster, bima  and bpss <dig> at  <dig> to 6 h post-infection. moreover, the hemolysin activator-like protein precursor, fhac  gene was significantly up-regulated during intracellular infection. consistently, the large filamentous hemagglutinin precursor, fhab  gene, a potential virulence factor of b. pseudomallei <cit> , was induced between  <dig> to 6 h post-infection.

stress responses genes
the general stress-responsive alternative sigma factor rpos transcribes genes involved in bacterial survival under conditions of environmental stress. in b. pseudomalleirpos is a regulator of carbon starvation and oxidative stress  <cit> .we observed down-regulation of rpos throughout intracellular growth. furthermore, the expression of most of the genes encoding sigma factors was repressed in the intracellular bacteria. under oxidative stress, rpos regulates oxyr and katgdpsa operons  <cit> . as expected, we observed down regulation of oxyr and katgdpsa expression at  <dig> and 2 h post-infection. the expression of other genes in the oxy r regulon was either repressed or did not change significantly relative to control cells. moreover, class i stress response genes including dnajdnakhrca and groel were not significantly regulated, except for groes, which was induced at 6 h post-infection.

dna topology and growth arrest within macrophages
modification of dna topology plays a major role in assisting dna replication and protein synthesis. prokaryotic dna is usually maintained in a negatively supercoiled form by topoisomerases and the level of supercoiling can be affected by several environmental parameters  <cit> . the ability of dna gyrase to generate negative supercoils in dna is inhibited when atp levels are reduced  <cit> . in this study, dna topoisomerase iv subunit a , dna topoisomerase iv subunit b  and dna gyrase subunit a  genes were down-regulated. the repression of gyrase suggests a relaxation in bacterial dna supercoiling during b. pseudomallei intracellular growth in u <dig>  additionally, the nucleotide-associated regulator protein fis was also negatively regulated. fis expression depends on superhelical density whereby maximum density is observed at high levels of negative supercoiling  <cit> .

we found that bacterial genes involved in cell division  were down-regulated indicating reduced cell division activity. the repression of mind and mine genes, which mediate spatial regulation of cytokinesis in bacteria  <cit> , and chromosome partitioning genes, para and parb was also observed. furthermore, replicative dna helicase dnab, dna polymerase iii subunit alpha dnae and dna polymerase iii subunit chi genes were also down-regulated. consistent with the down regulation of catabolic and cell replication genes, the expression of rna polymerase  and ribosomal subunit genes  was also reduced throughout the infection period. collectively, these support the view that cell division and replication processes are interrupted during infection, leading to slower growth kinetics of intracellular b. pseudomallei.

discussion
numerous studies have been conducted on the cellular interaction between b. pseudomallei and eukaryotic cells, especially the ability of this pathogen to survive within host cells. in this study, we investigated the global b. pseudomallei transcriptome profile during early stage infection of human monocyte-like u <dig> cells. initially, we demonstrated that replication kinetics of intracellular b. pseudomallei within u <dig> cells is similar to data from a number of previous studies  <cit> . the bacteria were able to survive in macrophage cells, albeit, at a slower growth rate compared to bacteria grown in rpmi. reduced bacterial growth kinetics during infection was also reported in a hamster model of melioidosis  <cit> . furthermore, this reduced bacterial replication kinetics in the intracellular environment in comparison with in vitro growth is not limited to b. pseudomallei <cit> . b. pseudomallei infection was also cytotoxic to macrophage cells with about 20 % cell mortality at 24 h post infection which, to some extent, explains the reduced number of recovered bacteria with prolonged incubation. electron micrographs of infected u <dig> cells revealed disruption of internal structures and formation of oncotic cells. the cytotoxic and cytopathy effects of b. pseudomallei infection in our study are in agreement with sun et al.  <cit> , who reported high cytotoxicity  and oncotic death in infected thp- <dig> cells. we also observed the loss of phagosome membrane in infected macrophages as early as 2 h post-infection resulting in the presence of free replicating bacilli in the cytoplasm at later time points.

the ability to survive within and lyse macrophage cells most probably contributes to the spread of this bacterium and disease progression. we attempted to identify mechanisms that underlie the adaptive ability of b. pseudomallei during infection by comparing intracellular bacteria transcripts to that of in vitro grown bacteria. during infection, we observed that intracellular b. pseudomallei demonstrated a lower energy requirement and production by shutting down metabolic activity. the reduced expression of catabolic and house-keeping genes is consistent with the reduced growth rate observed for intracellular b. pseudomallei. the induction of anaerobic metabolism pathway genes is suggestive of limited oxygen concentrations in the cytosol although expression of genes of the anaerobic respiratory chain was not significantly altered. the importance of this finding requires further investigation.

b. pseudomallei utilizes alternative metabolites during infection  <cit> . our study suggests that b. pseudomallei utilize aromatic carbon compounds such as benzoate and pa as carbon sources for intracellular survival. pa can inhibit the inducible nitric oxide synthase  and lps-induced expression of cytokines in rat primary astrocytes, microglia and macrophages  <cit> . moreover, pa can repress dna binding and transcriptional activities of nfκb, an important upstream modulator for cytokine and inos expression in macrophages  <cit> . the up-regulation of pa catabolic pathway genes in intracellular bacteria might partly explain why macrophages infected with b. pseudomallei failed to activate the production of inos  <cit> . the putative b. cenocepacia ring pa-coenzyme a hydroxylation system was found to be essential for full pathogenicity in infected caenorhabditis elegans <cit> .

there are three t3sss present in b. pseudomallei and only t3ss- <dig> is involved in virulence  <cit> . b. pseudomallei t3ss- <dig> shows high homology to the inv/mxi-spa type iii secretion systems of salmonella and shigella <cit> . as t3ss- <dig> is known to be essential in facilitating invasion and early phagosomal escape into the cytosol  <cit> , the down-regulation observed in our study is consistent with this function as it would be conceivable that t3ss- <dig> is important at the beginning of intracellular life during invasion, but not important at the later stages of intracellular infection. similarly, the role of t6ss- <dig> is reported to be crucial during the transition from phagosome to cytosol  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the induction of t6ss- <dig> in this study plays a major function in ensuring pathogen survival and replication in the cytosol. in b. mallei, a close related species of b. pseudomallei, an effector protein of t6ss  was recognized by glanders antiserum, indicating production of this protein in vivo during infection  <cit> . in this study, high induction of tssd- <dig> , an effector hcp <dig> protein of t6ss was observed throughout the infection period. a recent study on b. pseudomallei t6ss hcp proteins has shown that tssd- <dig> deletion mutant was attenuated in a hamster infection model, exhibited growth defects and was only weakly cytotoxic to raw <dig>  macrophages  <cit> . additionally, human melioidosis serum samples were found to react with hcp <dig> protein, consistent with our observation . these results suggest that hcp <dig> is produced by b. pseudomallei in vivo during infection, is immunogenic and vital for intracellular survival of b. pseudomallei.

the genes bimafhab and fhac are known proteins that mediate actin tail formation involved in cell-to-cell spread. in this study, expression of these three genes is up-regulated. the over expression of bima has previously been shown in intracellular b. pseudomallei and mutation of bima abolished actin-based motility of this pathogen in j <dig>  cell  <cit> . in bordetella pertussis, the fhac dependent filamentous hemagglutinin  facilitates attachment to the host cell during infection  <cit>  and initiates killing of macrophages to avoid the host cell mediated immune response whilst infection is being established  <cit> . through a genome-wide function screen of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig>  both fhab and fhac were found to form part of the anti-macrophage loci and contribute to the formation of dramatic actin projections extending towards neighbouring cells  <cit> .

interestingly, in our study, well-characterized virulence genes of b. pseudomallei such as capsular polysaccharide, lps and flagella were either repressed or not significantly expressed. similar profiles were noted in a hamster model, wherein most of the genes encoding for capsule, lps and flagella biosynthesis were either down-regulated or not significantly changed in expression  <cit> . this could be due to the equal expression of these genes under in vivo and in vitro conditions concomitant with previous evidence that capsule, lps, flagellum and other virulent determinants are constitutively produced in vitro <cit> . a recent report of a similar study on macrophages infected by b. cenocepacia demonstrated that this intracellular pathogen’s ability to adapt and respond to the intracellular milieu was not dependent on the expression of any specific virulence-associated factors  <cit> . hence, this ability to adapt to various niches appears to be conserved amongst the soil-derived burkholderia spp. clinical pathogens. down regulation of flagella genes and subsequently the absence of flagellin, may also reflect the bacteria’s attempt to limit immune recognition especially by toll-like receptors by modulating surface structures. in gram negative bacteria, flagellin is recognized by tlr <dig> which triggers the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines, leading to an inflammatory response  <cit> . by dampening the activation of tlr <dig>  the innate immune response towards b. pseudomallei is reduced and bacterial clearance is prevented. consistent with our observations, b. pseudomallei isolates failed to significantly increase tlr <dig> expression in both cell culture  <cit>  and balb/c mice infection models  <cit> . nanagara et al.  <cit>  also suggested that the suppression of b. pseudomallei surface antigens in naturally infected human synovial tissues aids in bacteria survival against host immune responses and antibiotic treatment.

intracellular bacteria are constantly exposed to a range of stresses such as oxidative burst and formation of oxygen radicals by the host cellular defence mechanisms. several in vitro studies designed to mimic the host environment have identified the expression of the dspa <cit>  and ahpc-katg <cit>  genes as necessary for survival and growth under oxidative stress. surprisingly, in our study, expression of the majority of oxidative stress related genes was repressed or not significantly altered. this observation suggests the ability of b. pseudomallei to rapidly evade oxidative stress by escaping from the phagosome  <cit> . this enables the bacteria to enter the cytoplasm, a more favourable environment for survival and growth where nutrients are freely available and microbicides do not operate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a complete transcriptome profile of intracellular b. pseudomallei within macrophages. we have determined that b. pseudomallei adapts rapidly to the intracellular environment through the regulation of bacteria metabolism and growth rate and the possibility of host cell immune response avoidance through shutdown of known virulence factors. proteins encoded by genes induced during infection including genes encoding the t6ss cluster are potential diagnostic candidates or targets for anti-microbial development.
