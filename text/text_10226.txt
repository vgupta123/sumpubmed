BACKGROUND
sleep is a complex phenotype that involves several neurochemical and physiological processes. it is known to perform restorative functions and to facilitate memory consolidation  <cit> . although sleep is essential for overall well-being and optimal physical and psychological functioning, chronic sleep restriction is frequently experienced due to contemporary social and domestic responsibilities, medical conditions and sleep disorders  <cit> . sleep restriction alters sleep architecture primarily by decreasing the duration of the rem  sleep stage, also known as paradoxical sleep   <cit> . therefore, approaches that reduce or abolish ps have been used to simulate chronic sleep restriction.

persistent sleep debt impairs neurobehavioral functions  <cit>  and increases the risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disorders  <cit> , erectile dysfunction  <cit>  and diabetes  <cit> . thus, careful characterization of the effects of sleep deprivation not only improves our knowledge about the complex sleep process but also contributes to elucidation of the mechanism underlying these chronic diseases and their treatment. remarkably, sleep genetics has been emerging as one of the important features in sleep research  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that genetic background or certain gene products can affect individual sleep patterns  <cit> . investigation of these candidate genes can help identify the molecular machinery responsible for both normal sleep and sleep-related disorders.

reverse transcription  followed by quantitative real time pcr  is one of the most compelling approaches for gene expression analysis due to speed and simplicity of the method  <cit> . potential methodological variations can be corrected by normalizing the gene expression of interest to a set of references, frequently referred to as housekeeping genes, which presumably maintain constitutive expression. however, increasing evidence has demonstrated that the expression of commonly used reference genes, such as b-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , can vary under certain circumstances  <cit> . consequently, the selection and validation of reference genes for the tissue and experimental conditions of interest is a critical step to generate reliable results using rtqpcr methodology.

herein, the expression stability  of four common reference genes  was evaluated in brain and blood collected from control and sleep deprived rats, using genorm software  <cit> . in order to validate the selected reference genes, the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor  and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase <dig>  was examined in brain and blood, respectively, as the expression of these genes has been shown to vary with sleep deprivation  <cit> .

RESULTS
rna quality
rna quality is one of the most important factors that determine the precision of rtqpcr. in order to evaluate the quality of the dnase i treated rna, we performed electrophoresis in agarose gel. all rna samples used in this study exhibited intact  <dig> s and  <dig> s rrna and similar banding patterns , indicating that degradation of rna was negligible. also, the absence of high molecular weight molecules suggested that contamination with genomic dna was minimal. these data demonstrated that the rna samples used for this study were of appropriate quality to perform rtqpcr.

rtqpcr
pilot experiments were performed with b-actin primers to determine the optimal amounts of rna and cdna that result in ct values within the linear range. a total of  <dig>  μg of rna, treated with dnase i, was used for the  <dig> μl reverse transcription reaction and  <dig> μl of cdna was used for qpcr. subsequently, the same amounts of rna and cdna were used for all reactions producing ct values within  <dig>  to  <dig>  ranges. analysis of each amplification product produced a dissociation curve containing a single peak with narrow melting temperature , indicating that each primer pair amplified a single predominant product.

expression stability of the reference genes
the expression of b-actin, b2m, gapdh and hprt was measured in two independent experiments where the rats were distributed into three groups: controls , animals subjected to paradoxical sleep deprivation for  <dig> hours  and animals subjected to psd <dig> and then a sleep recovery period of  <dig> hours . in the second experiment, a group of animals subjected to total sleep deprivation for  <dig> hours  was included. for all samples, qpcr was performed at least in duplicate and reproducible ct values were obtained with correlation coefficient >  <dig>   for both experiments.

the data from c, psd <dig> and sr <dig> groups were arrayed in a single matrix for the calculation of m values. to assess the variability between the experiments, m values were calculated for each experiment separately. the data of tsd <dig> and respective control groups were analyzed in a distinct matrix in order to discriminate the effect of psd from the tsd. as shown in table  <dig>  all genes presented relatively low m values for both protocols of sleep deprivation. although the best pair of reference genes  varied between the two experiments, the four genes can be considered suitable reference genes for sleep-related gene expression studies, according to the previously suggested cut-off of m value  for a stable reference gene  <cit> .

exp_ <dig> and exp_ <dig> contained  <dig> groups: control, psd <dig> and sr <dig>  exp_ <dig> contained  <dig> groups: control and tsd <dig> 

to distinguish the effect of sleep deprivation on gene expression stability, m values were also calculated for each group  independently, but all m values were below the cut-off , suggesting that total or paradoxical sleep deprivation did not alter the expression stability of commonly used reference genes.

validation of the reference genes
to validate the selected reference genes, the expression of bdnf was determined by rtqpcr in brain. relative expression fold changes were calculated by the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit>  using b-actin, b2m, gapdh or hprt as the reference genes as well as by using the normalization factor  derived from the geometric mean of four reference genes  <cit> .

the normalization with each reference gene or with the nf produced consistent results showing that psd <dig> did not alter the bdnf expression compared to the control . however, conflicting results were obtained regarding the effect of sleep recovery. while b-actin or hprt generated slight, but statistically significant decrease in bdnf expression for the sr <dig> group , the use of b2m, gapdh or nf as references did not produced a similar reduction compared to the control .

in a similar way, the effect of tsd <dig> was also statistically variable depending on the selection of the reference gene: normalization with b2m, gapdh or nf resulted in significant increase of bdnf expression compared to the control , while the use of b-actin or hprt did not validate the effect of tsd .

in blood, the expression of gpd <dig> was evaluated since sleep and metabolism are closely related and that gpd <dig> is one of the key intermediates between the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  <cit> . all reference genes and nf resulted in a significant increase of gpd <dig> expression in psd <dig> group compared to the controls  but the magnitude of fold changes was somewhat different between each analysis . in sr <dig> group, the mean relative expression was increased by at least two fold compared to the controls, but it did not reach statistical significance, probably due to high individual variability .

tsd <dig> was not sufficient to produce similar increase in gpd <dig> expression, and all reference genes and nf generated consistent results .

discussion
effects of sleep deprivation on the expression of classical reference genes
given the importance of the genetic aspect of sleep research, substantial efforts were made to identify genes involved in sleep-wake cycles. these studies reported that sleep deprivation can modify the expression of genes frequently used as internal controls for rtqpcr  <cit> . for instance, short-term sleep deprivation altered the expression of cytoskeletal proteins such as beta-actin and tubulin in two independent proteomic analyses  <cit> . furthermore, biswas and colleagues showed that the amount of actin and tubulin decreased in the brains of paradoxical sleep-deprived rats and culminated in neuronal apoptosis  <cit> . gapdh is another classical reference gene that requires careful analysis before using in sleep-related gene expression studies. several studies demonstrated that sleep deprivation or sleep disorders alter glucose metabolism and enhance the risk for type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . thus, despite lack of direct evidence, the strong correlation between sleep and glucose metabolism suggests that the expression and/or activity of gapdh might be modulated by the sleep-wake cycle.

these findings strongly justified the importance of the present study and our data demonstrated that the most commonly used reference genes presented stable expression throughout the total or paradoxical sleep deprivation period, as the m values were below the cut-off previously suggested for stable genes  <cit> .

expression of bdnf in the brain
brain-derived neurotrophic factor  is an important mediator of memory and cognition and its expression is strongly modulated by neuronal activity  <cit> . in our previous study, we observed that the psd <dig> increased the expression of bdnf in cortical tissue  <cit>  while other group showed that bdnf expression was reduced by  <dig> h of psd in the cerebellum and brainstem  <cit> . in the present study, we did not observe any alteration of bdnf expression in paradoxical sleep deprived rats. conceivably, distinct regulation of bdnf expression may occur throughout the different regions of the brain and therefore, the use of whole brain might mask the effect of psd on specific region of the brain. on the other hand, the intracerebral injection of exogenous bdnf in rat increased the time spent in nrem sleep without affecting rem sleep  <cit> . these data spare the possibility of bdnf expression being minimally affected by psd in many areas of the brain corroborating the present findings.

in contrast, the short-term total sleep deprivation appears to up-regulate the expression of bdnf in various regions of the brain  <cit>  suggesting that the use of whole brain would not interfere with the gene expression results. as expected, an overall increase in mean relative expression of bdnf was observed in tsd <dig> group, but the statistical significance was achieved only when b2m, gapdh or nf were used for the normalization, although all tested reference genes presented stable expression stability. these data illustrated that use of single reference gene can produce flawed results leading to misinterpretation of physiological events. thus, the application of multiple reference genes in rtqpcr is desirable for reliable results.

expression of gpd <dig> in blood
the reduction of sleep time and augment of obese individuals in modern life are concurrent trends indicating that sleep-wake cycle has strong impacts on the energy metabolism  <cit> . gpd <dig> is a nad+ dependent cytosolic enzyme that generates key intermediates between glucose and lipid metabolism  <cit> . in our previous studies, we found that gpd <dig> expression was increased in cortex and blood of rat subjected to psd <dig> compared to controls  <cit> . although the increase of gpd <dig> expression followed by psd <dig> was confirmed in this study, short-term tsd did not have significant effect on the expression of this gene. several studies have demonstrated that the alteration of biochemical parameters can occur even after short period of sleep deprivation  <cit> . thus, the increase of gpd <dig> expression occurred after psd <dig> can be a secondary effect of prolonged paradoxical sleep loss. finally, the fact that both bdnf and gpd <dig> expression was differently modulated by psd and tsd demonstrates the importance of distinct protocols of sleep deprivation in order to discriminate events that happen in each stage of sleep at distinct time course.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that the most commonly used reference genes are suitable for gene expression studies that involve sleep deprivation. however, more reliable results of rtqpcr can be obtained when multiple reference genes are used.
