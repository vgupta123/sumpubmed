BACKGROUND
currently, promoters of many genes from a wide range of organisms are used in genetic engineering of plants. promoters are traditionally divided into three types: constitutive, tissue-specific, and inducible  <cit> . in former times, virtually all transgenic plants contained two heterologous genes: one, a selection marker gene controlled by a constitutive promoter and the other a target gene controlled by a promoter of any type to change the plant phenotype. at present, multigene transformation allows the import of entire metabolic pathways into plants, including expression of protein complexes consisting of several target genes for the generation of transgenic plants producing multiple compounds simultaneously  <cit> . either a number of different promoters with similar level and profile of expression, or several copies of the same promoter must be used in one genetic construct for multigene transformation. both approaches are complicated for a number of reasons. firstly, there is a lack of available promoters with the necessary parameters. secondly, the introduction of repetitive sequences in the same or different loci of a transgenic plant genome can have a negative effect on the expression and inheritance of heterologous genes due to the effect of homology-dependent gene silencing .

up to now, the constitutive promoter camv 35s, created on the basis of shell protein 35s gene promoter region from cauliflower mosaic virus camv, is most widely used in vectors for genetic transformation of plants  <cit> . the camv 35s promoter usually provides a high expression level of heterologous genes in plants, but it has some significant drawbacks. the promoter originates from a virus and infection of transgenic plants with camv virus may lead to the silencing of a heterologous gene controlled by camv 35s  <cit> . in addition, the widespread use of the camv 35s promoter increases the probability to inactivate expression of heterologous genes under its control as a result of the homologous recombination  <cit> .

in addition to camv 35s, a number of other viral promoters are used for plant biotechnology . recently, a highly efficient promoter was created from individual parts of different viral promoters  <cit> . such a widespread use of viral promoters is in part due to the lack of well-characterized strong plant gene promoters, particularly from dicotyledons.

for monocotyledonous plants, strong promoters are known, such as act <dig> and zmubi, which are already used in crop plant genetic engineering for quite a long time . recently, several strong and constitutive promoters apx, pgd <dig> and r1g1b from rice  were proposed for biotechnology of the same plant, which performed significantly better than the previously studied promoters act <dig> and zmubi  <cit> . strong and constitutive promoters of ubiquitin genes rub <dig> from o. sativa and ubi <dig> from brachypodium distachyon were characterized and demonstrated to exceed camv 35s in activity up to 35-fold in transgenic monocotyledonous plants  <cit> .

at the same time, a number of strong and constitutive promoters were cloned for genetic engineering of dicotyledonous plants, but they not perform as well as those from the monocots described above. the promoters of ubq <dig> and ubq <dig> genes from arabidopsis thaliana are active in all tissues of tobacco  at the level of viral camv 35s promoter  <cit> . quantification of promoter strength using transient expression in lima bean  cotyledonary tissue showed that gmubi and gmscream promoters from soybean  yielded from  <dig> to 7-fold higher expression than a standard camv 35s promoter  <cit> . the promoter of the acetolactate synthase als <dig> gene from cabbage  is constitutive and comparable in efficiency to camv 35s  <cit> . use of the strong constitutive promoter mthp from medicago truncatula to drive gus expression in arabidopsis, showed around 50 % higher gus activity as compared to the camv 35s promoter. the activity of this promoter in transgenic plants of clover  and alfalfa  was  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than that of camv 35s, respectively  <cit> . the promoter of acc-synthase vr-acs <dig> gene from mung bean  demonstrated greater efficiency producing up to  <dig> times higher activity of the reporter proteins in transgenic tobacco and arabidopsis, compared to the camv 35s  <cit> . the apparent superiority of the vr-acs <dig> promoter over the viral one was not only the result of transcriptional activation but also of more efficient translation.

despite the abundance of literature on the use of plant promoters in plant biotechnology, the lack of effective promoters for high expression of target genes still exists.

in this study we focused on another group of plant genes that can be a source of effective promoters. when studying antifungal peptides of chickweed , we found that the expression of their genes pro-smamp <dig> and pro-smamp <dig> is high and that it increases when s. media is treated by the elicitor methyl jasmonate or infected by pathogenic fungi  <cit> . the pro-smamp <dig> gene expression increased from  <dig> to  <dig> times reaching the level of the chickweed house-keeping gene β-actin. the expression of the other gene, pro-smamp <dig>  is rather constitutive because its activity does not change so much under the influence of the above factors . at the same time its normal level of activity was unusually high in different organs , comparable or superior to the level of β-actin expression.

the high expression level of pro-smamp <dig> gene indicates that this gene has a strong promoter, which may be of interest for application in plant biotechnology. for that reason, we identified the promoter sequence and studied the properties of the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter.

RESULTS
cloning the nucleotide sequence of pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter region and production of genetic constructs for plant transformation
as a result of “genome walking”, a 2400 bp target fragment of s. media genome was amplified. its sequencing showed that the fragment includes part of the coding sequence of the pro-smamp <dig> gene and 2160 bp 5′-flanking region from the translation start site  including 40 bp of pro-smamp <dig> gene 5′-utr. the nucleotide sequence including the expected promoter region was analyzed by programs place  <cit>  and plantcare  <cit> , which revealed some regulatory motifs previously found in most eukaryotic promoters . for instance, the following sequence features were found: one w box, four tgacg motifs, one s box, four binding sites of myb transcription factor, tc-rich repeat, one tga-element involved in response to auxin and one are element involved in response to anaerobic conditions. in addition, motifs responsible for tissue-specific gene expression or expression that is invoked in response to the light conditions are present in the nucleotide sequence of the promoter region. amongst these, were one gcn <dig> motif and four skn- <dig> motifs, both of which are associated with increased expression in the endosperm of seeds, one ac-i motif associated with increased expression in the xylem, one i box, two gt <dig> motifs and two g box elements, all related to lre elements responsible for expression in above-ground parts and regulated by light exposure. the presence of such motifs suggests that the activity of the pro-smamp <dig> gene in chickweed plant can be regulated by the interaction of different transcription factors with the corresponding cis-elements within the promoter. moreover, the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter contains the conservative sequence of tata-box catttccactatatatag, caat-box motif and the transcription initiation site cancn2a. altogether, this analysis suggests that pro-smamp <dig> promoter is strong and potentially regulated in response to stress, as for example, pathogen attack and/or light exposure.fig.  <dig> the nucleotide sequence of 5′-flanking promoter region of pro-smamp <dig> gene and location of cis-acting elements . vertical arrows mark the starting points of the 5′-deletion variant nucleotide sequences. tss is the transcription start site at −40 bp from atg codon behind the region highlighted in red. translation initiation site atg + <dig> is labeled in italics



the sequence of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter region shown in fig.  <dig> also includes the 5′-utr of pro-smamp <dig> gene, which was only 40 bp in the 5′ direction from the translation initiation site atg.

in order to study the properties of the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter related to the expression of genes in heterologous systems, six genetic constructs, containing various 5′-deletion variants of the promoter region with 5′utr, were obtained .fig.  <dig> the scheme of constructs with deletion variants of pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter region designed on basis of plant expression vector pcambia 1381z for analysis of gus reporter gene expression. plant expression vector pmog-35sintgus containing camv 35s viral promoter was used as a control. the translated region of gus gene is colored black; int - modified castor bean catalase intron within the translated region of gus gene; piv <dig> - modified potato st-ls <dig> gene intron within the translated region of gus gene. promoters are depicted as arrows with the appropriate signatures



deletion variants of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter region were chosen in such a way that the location of cis-regulatory elements in the nucleotide sequence was taken into account. the plasmid pmog-35sintgus, in which the gus gene is controlled by the camv 35s viral promoter, was used as a positive control. in the vectors, modified castor bean catalase intron or st-ls <dig> gene intron was placed within the sequence of the gus gene  to prevent the influence of agrobacterium contamination on the results of gus activity measurements in transformed plants.

pro-smamp <dig> promoter yields higher gus activity in t <dig> transgenic tobacco plants than the camv 35s promoter
after agrobacterium-mediated transformation, independent t <dig> tobacco plants, each taken from individual calli, were selected in the following number: t0p <dig> -  <dig> plants, t0p <dig> -  <dig> plants, t0p <dig> -  <dig> plants, t0p <dig> -  <dig> plants, t0p <dig> -  <dig> plants, t0p <dig> -  <dig> plants, and control Т0pmog-35sintgus -  <dig> plants. estimation of the gus activity in protein extracts from leaves of aseptic transgenic plants showed that all deletion variants of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter except −290 bp  expressed the gus gene.

in most transgenic plants from groups t0p <dig>  t0p <dig>  t0p <dig> and t0p <dig>  the gus activity ranged from  <dig> to 20 nmol/mg · min. this was several times higher than the gus activity measured in the control plants Т0pmog-35sintgus, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nmol/mg · min . the level of gus activity in t0p <dig> plants was comparable to plants expressing gus under the control of camv 35s promoter, and did not exceed  <dig>  nmol/mg · min . differences in gus activity levels amongst independent primary transformants of different constructs is most probably due to the integration of multiple t-dna copies into their genome or chimerism.fig.  <dig> the gus activity in tobacco transformants t <dig>  a plants were growing under aseptic conditions  <dig>  months after rooting on the medium with a selective agent. the average values of activity from three mature leaves of each transformant ± se  are presented. b plants were grown for six weeks in soil after being transplanted from aseptic conditions. the average activity values of three samples from one leaf of each transformant ± se are presented



similar to the measurements in aseptic plants, gus enzymatic activity was analyzed in the tobacco leaves of t <dig> plants, grown in soil. first, fig. 3b shows that the maximum levels of gus activity in leaves of t <dig> transgenic tobacco plants grown in the soil were notably higher than the values obtained for the same plants under aseptic conditions. on average, gus activity values of 180 nmol/mg · min in t0p <dig>  150 nmol/mg · min in t0p <dig>  70 nmol/mg · min in t0p <dig>  84 nmol/mg · min in t0p <dig>  and 31 nmol/mg · min in t0p <dig> were observed. however, a  <dig> to 10-fold difference was detected between some of the individual Т0p <dig>  Т0p <dig> and Т0p <dig> plants. secondly, unlike under aseptic conditions, in average, the highest gus activity of plants grown in soil was observed in t0p <dig> plants. thirdly, decreasing the length of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter resulted in a decrease in gus activity. in the camv 35s plants the average gus activity was not higher than  <dig>  nmol/mg.min. it should be noted that the gus activity of the Т0pmog-35sintgus plants grown in soil was also slightly  higher than in the aseptically grown plants.

the highest levels of gus activity was measured in leaves of tobacco plants Т0p <dig> , Т0p <dig> , Т0p <dig> , Т0p <dig>  and Т0p <dig>  growing in soil . gus activity in the adventitious roots and flowers of the same plants was less than 20 % of the activity in leaves and ranged  <dig> to 5-fold between samples of one transgene version. gus activity in stems of individual primary transformants Т0p <dig>  could be at the level of activity in leaves but it varied  <dig> to 4-fold from plant to plant. gus activity in stems of other transgenic lines Т0p <dig>  Т0p <dig>  Т0p <dig> and Т0p <dig> was not higher than 25 % of activity in leaves and it also varied greatly from plant to plant .

pro-smamp <dig> promoter retains its activity in the progeny of t1-t <dig> transgenic plants
the level of gus activity in the progeny of t <dig> transgenic plants was studied to characterize the properties of pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants across the generations. for that, seeds of t <dig> from five transgenic tobacco plants of each group Т0p <dig>  Т0p <dig>  Т0p <dig>  Т0p <dig> and Т0p <dig> expressing gus gene were produced by self-pollination. at least  <dig> seeds from each t <dig> plant representing one population were aseptically planted on selective medium containing the antibioticum hygromycin. after  <dig> weeks of selection, segregation of plants into the subpopulations of transgenic t <dig>  and non-transgenic  was analyzed. in some populations from groups t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  t1p <dig> and t1p <dig>  a segregation ratio of 3: <dig> between green and white plants was confirmed using the chi-square criterion which is consistent with the presence of t-dna at a single locus of the genome. these results, however, do not allow an estimate of the number of t-dna repeats at such insertion locus.

in some t <dig> populations the segregation ratio was different from monogenic being equal to 2: <dig>  probably as a result of elimination of one transgenic class. there were also t <dig> populations with a segregation ratio of 15: <dig>  which suggests the presence of t-dna in two unlinked loci of the ancestral t <dig> plant genome.

enzymatic activity of gus protein was studied in t <dig> plants with all deletion variants t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  t1p <dig> and t1p <dig> to determine the level of the reporter gene gus expression. as shown in fig. 4a, high gus activity was still present in t <dig> transgenic tobacco plants carrying all deletion variants of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter. two-fold difference in levels of gus activity between individual transgenic plants from the same t <dig> population with monogenic segregation observed in all variants most probably resulted from their t-dna locus being homo- or heterozygotic . the difference in gus activity between different populations with monogenic inheritance of t1p <dig>  t1p <dig> and t1p <dig> t-dna could result from the integration of two t-dna copies into one chromosome locus or from the positional effect of t-dna insertion .fig.  <dig> the gus activity in leaves of transgenic tobacco plants from three consecutive generations  measured in six weeks of growth in soil after transplanting from aseptic conditions. the average activity values of three samples from one leaf of each transformant ± se are presented. the average activity among the plants of one population ± confidence interval  are shown as gray bars. a t <dig>  b t <dig>  c t3




the gus activity level was significantly lower in all t <dig> transgenic plants compared to the progenitor t <dig> plants. the highest reduction  was observed in the Т1р <dig> plants. the activity decreased 8- to 11-fold in t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  and  <dig> to 5-fold in Т1p <dig> plants. thus, the longer the nucleotide sequence of the promoter deletion variant, the greater the reduction in gus activity in t <dig> plants compared to the progenitor t <dig> plants.

nevertheless, even the level of gus activity in transgenic t <dig> plants of the efficient deletion variants of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter region was equal to or several times higher than the activity achieved with the camv 35s promoter .

for t <dig> generation studies, only transgenic plants with the longest −2120 bp and the shortest −455 bp deletion variants of pro-smamp <dig> promoter were used. high gus activity was preserved in transgenic tobacco plants of t <dig> generation with deletion variants − <dig> and −455 bp of pro-smamp <dig> promoter . in two independent Т2p <dig> populations, no. 8– <dig> and no. 19– <dig>  all transgenic plants were resistant to the selective agent hygromycin and did not differ significantly in the level of gus activity from each other, what indicates that they are homozygous for the t-dna locus. the average gus activity level in the population no. 19– <dig> and no. 8– <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg.min and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg.min respectively, which corresponds to the activity in their parent t <dig> plants .

unlike transgenic plants Т2p <dig> no. 14– <dig>  all of which were resistant to hygromycin, the plant population no. 10– <dig> segregated in the ratio of 3: <dig> for resistance to hygromycin . these results show that plants of Т2p <dig> population no. 10– <dig> were obtained from t <dig> generation plants hemizygous for t-dna locus. the average level of activity in plants of the population no. 14– <dig> was about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg · min, that is about  <dig>  times higher than the average level in the population Т2p <dig> no. 10– <dig>  being  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg · min . at the same time, activity levels were close in plants Т2p <dig> no. 14– <dig> and in two plants from populations no. 10– <dig> with the highest activity, which, as we assume, were homozygous for t-dna loci. in order to confirm this we produced and analyzed t <dig> generation. two plants with gus activity 2-fold higher than the other plants from the population Т2p <dig> no. 10– <dig> were used to generate t <dig> .

high gus activity was preserved in t <dig> generation transgenic tobacco plants on the level of their parent plants t <dig> with pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants − <dig> and −455 bp . all transgenic plants were resistant to hygromycin and had comparable level of gus activity in individual plants, which suggested their homozygous state for t-dna loci. the average level of gus activity in t3p <dig> populations was as high as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg · min in no. 14-3- <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  in no. 14-3- <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  in no. 10-8- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in no. 10-8- <dig>  the average level of gus activity in t3p <dig> populations was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg · min in no. 8-2- <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  in no. 8-2- <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  in no. 19-1- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in no. 19-1- <dig> 

southern blotting analysis showed that Т3p <dig> plants from population no. 8-2- <dig> and Т3p <dig> plants from population no. 14-3- <dig> contain t-dna insertion at one genomic locus . consequently, gus activity levels achieved in these plants was provided by a single locus t-dna insertion.fig.  <dig> southern blotting analysis of total dna from leaves of two plants Т3p <dig> no. 8-2- <dig>  and Т3p <dig> no. 14-3- <dig>  restricted with ecori. “c-“- total dna from leaves of non-transgenic tobacco plants restricted with ecori. m - marker . “c+” - plasmid pmog-35sintgus restricted with hindiii. the 740 bp fragment of gus gene was used as probe



gus activity changes during vegetative period in homozygous t <dig> lines with pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants − <dig> and −455 bp under different light conditions
in previous experiments, the level of gus activity was measured in transgenic plants of t1-t <dig> generations at the age of approximately 70 days. however, the dynamics of gus activity in leaves of homozygous transgenic plants during the growth season is not known. in addition, the effect of the length of the light period on pro-smamp <dig> promoter activity in heterologous plants was also not clear. as the pro-smamp <dig> promoter contains regulatory elements potentially able to change its activity in dependence of the light condition , we studied gus activity under different light regimes.

for this purpose, homozygous tobacco plants from transgenic lines Т3p <dig>  and Т3p <dig> , were grown at short and long day, bypassing the selection stage on the medium with hygromycin. data from fig.  <dig> suggest that gus activity was higher under long-day  than under short-day  condition on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in Т3p <dig> plants, and from day  <dig> to  <dig> in Т3p <dig> plants. however, these differences were not significant , except for day  <dig> in Т3p <dig> fig.  <dig> the gus activity in the leaves of t <dig> generation homozygous transgenic tobacco plants grown in soil from seeds. eight plants were studied under long day  and six plants under short day  conditions for both variants t3p <dig> and t3p <dig>  the average levels of gus activity in adjacent leaves from medium tiers ± se are presented



under long-day condition, gus activity level was at least  <dig>  times higher  in Т3p <dig> than in Т3p <dig> plants for the entire observation period . the same trend was detected under short-day condition, except days  <dig> and  <dig> when the differences between Т3p <dig> and Т3p <dig> were not significant .

figure  <dig> also shows that a gus activity of 9–11 nmol/mg · min in Т3p <dig> and 16–19 nmol/mg · min in Т3p <dig> plants, grown in the soil directly from seed, was reached on day  <dig>  but not on day  <dig> as was observed for those plants, selected on the medium with hygromycin . in the subsequent days, gus activity increased and reached on day  <dig> 22–29 nmol/mg · min in Т3p <dig> and 53–54 nmol/mg · min in Т3p <dig> . in plants with the pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variant −455 bp, gus activity on day  <dig> was comparable to that previously measured in the primary transformants growing in soil . measurements on day  <dig> showed that gus activity decreased: more in Т3p <dig> and less in Т3p <dig> plants .

gus activity correlates with the content of gus gene mrna in transgenic plants t3p <dig> and t3p455
the results of real-time pcr measurement of gus gene expression relative to the actin reference gene of tobacco are shown in fig. 7a. it can be concluded from the data that: 1) gus expression was higher than actin gene expression in almost all transgenic plants, and 2) on average, gus gene mrna content was two times higher in the samples from t3p <dig> than from t3p <dig> plants.fig.  <dig>

strong positive correlation  between gus activity levels and gus gene mrna expression was shown in the leaves of t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> plant variants analyzed together as a pooled set . the correlation coefficient for t3p <dig> plants taken separately  also supported the strong relationship between gus gene mrna content and the activity of its protein product, while the correlation was not that strong in the t3p <dig> variant .

when analyzed in a pooled group, activity of the gus protein per unit of gus gene mrna changed linearly with a regression coefficient of b =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . this parameter did not differ significantly between separate t3p <dig>  and t3p <dig>  groups due to large statistical variation.

pro-smamp <dig> promoter is active in different organs and at different stages of t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> development
staining showed that activity of both pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants is present in leaves, stems, roots, buds, anthers, microsporocytes and pollen. particularly intense staining was noted in the hypocotyl of all transgenic plants, which indicates a higher activity of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter region in this part of a plant . the least intense staining of leaves present in transgenes was typical for the youngest apical ones.fig.  <dig> the gus activity in different organs of Т3р <dig>  and Т3p <dig>  transgenic tobacco plants at various stages of their development. a roots, stems, and leaves at the age of 2 weeks after transplanting from aseptic conditions,  bud,  anthers,  microsporocytes, additionally stained by acetocarmine,  pollen



histochemical analysis allowed us to conclude that the pro-smamp <dig> promoter is active not only in plant cells at the stage of sporophyte but also during meiosis and at the stage of gametophyte, as gus activity was detected in the microsporocytes and pollen .

at the same time, a high level of gus activity in all studied organs and cells of transgenic plants did not allow to visually identify differences between the t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> variants. moreover, in some transgenic plant samples subjected to the histochemical analysis, products of x-gluc substrate hydrolysis stained not only the plants themselves but also the incubation solutions, that indicates that the levels of gus protein in these samples is very high. it was also noted that if the plant tissue was damaged, solution staining was more intense.

quantitative method of gus activity assay using 4mug substrate was used for comparative analysis of pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants activity in t <dig> seeds obtained from t2p <dig> and t2p <dig> tobacco plants. the activity from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nmol/mg.min was detected in t <dig> seeds, but it varied strongly even between plants from the same line. this finding was quite surprising, because in chickweed plants, the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter ensures the accumulation of antifungal peptides smamp <dig> a and smamp <dig> a in seeds  <cit> .

discussion
in previous studies, we established that pro-smamp <dig> gene expression in chickweed was at a very high level comparable with the level of actin gene expression, and the highest values were observed in the roots and flowers of plants  <cit> . in addition, pro-smamp <dig> gene expression in aseptic chickweed plants increased from two to five times due to the contact with phytopathogenic fungi, as well as after methyl jasmonate treatment. the combination of these results suggests that the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter is strong, slightly inducible and organ-specific in chickweed. the properties of the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter region in chickweed plant are determined by two factors, namely, the presence of specific regulatory elements in its nucleotide sequence, as well as the presence and activity of respective transcription factors within the plant cells.

it is known that the promoters of pr-protein genes are usually strong  <cit> , and the location of specific motifs such as catttccactatatatag, caat-box, cataaacataaac in the promoter core segment confirms this. such motifs are found in promoters of plant genes with high expression level  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter region contains conserved elements of tata-box, caat-box motif and the sequence of transcription initiation site . in addition, the promoter also contains some less conserved elements which may serve to fine-tune gene expression in tissues, organs or in response to different stimuli . among the latter ones there are probably cis-regulatory elements that ensure the activation of pro-smamp <dig> gene expression in aseptic chickweed plant after fungal infection or methyl jasmonate treatment.

analysis of gus reporter gene expression under the control of various deletion variants of pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter in aseptic transgenic tobacco plants allowed to identify the minimum length of −455 bp retaining promoter activity. the shorter deletion variant −290 bp did not show any activity in heterologous plants, despite the fact that they contained a tata-box and caat-box. the loss of activity may be associated with the deletion of the gt <dig> motif located in the area from − <dig> to 290 bp  which is necessary for the initiation and stabilization of the transcription complex tfiia-tbp-tata  <cit> . it is unlikely that the loss of another cis-element skn <dig> located in the same area of promoter sequence causes inactivation of the promoter transcriptional activity, because this regulatory element is associated with storage protein gene expression in the endosperm of a seed but not in leaves  <cit> .

the present study was performed using the strong and constitutive viral promoter camv 35s as a control. with this promoter, the level of gus activity was below  <dig>  nmol/mg.min in individual transformants of tobacco cultivar samsun nn . in general, this activity level is comparable with the results of other studies which reported the gus activities of  <dig> – <dig>  nmol/mg · min in individual transgenic lines of samsun nn or xanthi tobacco cultivars  <cit> . meanwhile, there are studies which provide experimental data demonstrating gus activity as high as 10 nmol/mg · min under camv 35s promoter in some tobacco lines  <cit> . it is known that the level of gus activity is highly variable in transgenic tobacco plants when using the camv 35s promoter which probably depends on the promoter version or measurement conditions. anyway, gus activity level with camv 35s promoter demonstrated in those studies that the camv 35s promoter can be used as a reference to compare our results with the data of other published research.

in aseptic tobacco plants, deletion variants of pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter region − <dig>  − <dig> and −455 bp, but not −2120 bp, provided a significantly higher activity of the reporter protein than known viral camv 35s promoter . these results suggest that the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter will be strong in dicotyledonous plants in case of stable integration into the genome. it was surprising that the longest pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variant −2120 bp was inferior to the other deletion variants and did not differ from camv 35s promoter in efficiency. this suggests that in the segment from − <dig> to 1504 bp of pro-smamp <dig> promoter region, there are regulatory elements acting negatively in aseptic tobacco plants. likely candidates could be three tgacg motifs, which are responsible for gene expression effects of methyl jasmonate in barley hordeum vulgare  <cit> , and gt <dig> motif capable of affecting gene expression in both positive and negative way  <cit> .

it was quite unexpected to observe an increase of gus activity in transgenic t <dig> tobacco plants after their transplantation into soil , and this effect was most prominent in the t0p <dig> plants, but less pronounced and comparable in magnitude in t0p <dig>  t0p <dig>  and t0p <dig>  in t0p <dig> plants, the increase in gus activity was also noted, but compared to the other groups it was very small and only slightly higher than under viral promoter camv 35s. based on these findings, we assume that the effect of expression induction could be mainly the result of the cumulative effect of tgacg elements  <cit> , partly w box  <cit>  and s box  <cit>  cis-elements involved in the response to elicitors of pathogenic fungi. association of soil microorganisms could act as inductor of pro-smamp <dig> promoter region in transgenic tobacco plants in the conditions of greenhouse.

previously, we have shown that the pro-smamp <dig> gene has the highest expression level in roots and flowers in chickweed plants  <cit> . however, in transgenic tobacco t0p <dig>  t0p <dig>  t0p <dig>  and t0p <dig>  the highest gus activity was observed in the leaves. this may be the result of formerly described cooperative interaction of cis-elements gt <dig> and i box , which are present in the core part of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter, in response to light . as tobacco plant leaves have larger surface area for light absorption than other organs, the maximum effect from gt <dig> and gata motifs appeared, apparently, in them. noteworthy, it has been demonstrated that the presence of gt element leads in some cases to the gene suppression in non-photosynthetic organs of plants  <cit> , which correlates with our data, since gus activity in roots of transgenic tobacco plants was significantly lower than in the above-ground parts.

the relatively high level of gus activity was preserved in t <dig> transgenic tobacco plants with all deletion variants of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter region . however, the absolute values of gus activity were significantly reduced in all groups, except t1p <dig>  and the values were closer to the level of gus activity in t <dig> aseptic plants . the most dramatic decrease of activity was observed in variant t1p <dig>  whereas the reduction was less pronounced and comparable between t1p <dig>  t1p <dig>  and t1p <dig>  the reason for the above activity changes is not clear; however, a certain similarity of this result with the above-described induction of gus expression in plants t0p <dig>  t0p <dig>  t0p <dig>  and t0p <dig> in the soil  suggests that the reduction in gus activity may be associated with tgacg cis-elements involved in the response to methyl jasmonate  <cit> .

nevertheless, the pro-smamp <dig> promoter efficiency in the progeny of transgenic t <dig> tobacco plants was comparable to the efficiency of the viral promoter camv s <dig>  which can induce gus activity in transgenic tobacco plants as high as  <dig> – <dig>  nmol/mg · min according to published data  <cit> .

high gus activity was preserved on the level of their parent plants in transgenic tobacco plants of generations t <dig> and t <dig> transformed by pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants − <dig> and −455 bp . individual t <dig> transgenic plants did not segregate on the selective medium with hygromycin and had a comparable level of gus activity within individual populations, which suggests their homozygosity by t-dna loci. the average level of gus activity in all populations of Т3p <dig> was about 20 nmol/mg · min which was approximately two times higher than the activity in Т3p <dig> . these results imply the presence of cis-elements in the region from − <dig> to 2120 bp of pro-smamp <dig> promoter which reduce promoter activity in tobacco plants. at the same time, it is possible that these cis-elements may contribute to the induction of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter in response to certain inducers; however, we failed to identify the inducers.

in homozygous transgenic tobacco plants t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> grown from seed in the soil, the pro-smamp <dig> promoter led to accumulation of the gus reporter protein during the vegetative period from day  <dig> to  <dig> . in t3p <dig> plants, but not in t3p <dig>  gus activity on day  <dig> reached the level detected earlier in the primary transformants grown in the soil . these results confirm the assumption that negatively acting cis-elements are present in the pro-smamp <dig> promoter sequence region from  <dig> to 455 bp.

more daylight hours led to increased gus accumulation in both t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> plants, which implies that pro-smamp <dig> promoter activity positively depends on the duration of illumination. this was expected, since its nucleotide sequence contains cis-elements able to react to changes in the duration of the light period . it should be noted that the camv 35s viral promoter in transgenic tobacco plants, on the contrary, had higher activity under short day condition  than under long day   <cit> .

overall, we see that in successive generations, the t1-t <dig> gus activity in transgenic tobacco plants with the shortest deletion variant −455 bp of pro-smamp <dig> promoter was approximately  <dig>  to 2-fold higher than in plants with the longest deletion variant of the promoter.

quantitative measurement of gus mrna showed that its level is much higher than the expression of the tobacco actin gene in many lines of t <dig> transgenic plants. the shorter deletion variant −455 bp of pro-smamp <dig> promoter produced 2-fold higher expression level of gus mrna than the longest deletion variant , what correlates with the gus activity. this positive correlation between gus gene expression level and the activity of its protein product gus  confirms that high gus activity in transgenic tobacco plants t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> is primarily related to the reporter gene transcription, but not to the translation of its mrna, as was the case with vr-acs <dig> gene promoter from vigna radiata l.  <cit> . it should be noted that all deletion variants of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter include its own  <dig> nucleotide long 5′utr . it is quite possible that it positively affects the stability of gus mrna, but in order to make this assertion more research is needed.

the regression coefficient b =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  was obtained for gus activity per mrna level unit calculated for all the transgenic tobacco plants on day  <dig> when grown under long-day condition , that indicates the process of intensive accumulation of gus reporter protein. this assumption is supported by the dynamics of gus activity in transgenic plants which is also intensively increasing from day  <dig> to  <dig> . the active form of the gus protein in plants is characterized by a long half-life time  <cit> . therefore, the process of high accumulation of gus protein in transgenic plants t3p <dig> and t3p <dig> may be explained not only by transcriptional activity of pro-smamp <dig> promoter but also by the integral effect of gus accumulation.

in fig.  <dig>  it is demonstrated that the activity of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter deletion variants − <dig> and −455 bp, which are most different in length, is present in leaves, stems, roots, buds, anthers, microsporocytes and pollen of t <dig> transgenic plants. particularly intense staining by the products of substrate x-gluc hydrolysis was noted in the region of hypocotyl , suggesting increased activity of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter in this part of the plant. these results can be helpful when creating transgenic plants resistant to pathogens that damage crops in the region of the hypocotyl .

gus activity in seeds of the studied plants varied greatly, probably due to inactivation of gus enzymatic activity during storage or due to seed dehydration. it should be noted that even in plants of the same line seeds were ripening with a  <dig> to 3 weeks difference.

CONCLUSIONS
from the results obtained with transgenic tobacco plants, we have concluded that the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter is strong, and its most promising deletion variant for target gene expression in plants is a variant of −455 bp length. given the high level of gus expression in transgenic tobacco plants under control of this promoter and the high level of pro-smamp <dig> gene expression in s. media plants  <cit> , it is expected that the pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter will retain high activity in other dicotyledonous plants.
