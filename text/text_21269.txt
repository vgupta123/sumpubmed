BACKGROUND
epigenetic regulation of gene expression constitutes a fundamental mechanism by which a series of chromatin modifications allow the normal functioning of the cell under different conditions  <cit> . in particular, these modifications control the repressive effect of chromatin, which limits the access of regulatory proteins to dna, thus posing serious restraints to biological processes like replication, transcription, etc  <cit> . in agreement with this, an increasingly large amount of experimental data shows the relevance of chromatin modifications in development  <cit> , disease  <cit> , etc. for example, recent studies indicate that histone modifications are involved in paternal x chromosome inactivation  <cit> . work from roopra and colleagues  <cit>  shows that histone methylation regulates the tissue-dependent silencing of neuronal genes. also, expression of hox transcription factors is directly related to the presence of histone marks  <cit> .

chromatin modifications are produced by a series of chromatin-modifying enzymes  that act on chromatin by either introducing histone modifications or by inducing atp-dependent nucleosome remodelling. histone modifications usually take place at histone tails and can introduce a wide variety of covalent marks including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc  <cit> . these marks provide a simple way to access nucleosomal dna and normally have different functional consequences  <cit> . a synthetic view of the biological role of histone modifications is provided by the histone code hypothesis  <cit> . according to this hypothesis, the regulatory state of a gene is a function of these modifications and their combinations. apart from histone-modifying enzymes, enzymes that utilise atp to modify the nucleosomal structure, altering histone-dna interactions  <cit> , also give access to nucleosomal dna. interestingly, both mechanisms are coordinated and cooperate to finally give access to nucleosomal dna. for example, it has been recently shown that the swi/snf complex is retained to the chromatin only if saga or nua <dig> acetylate it  <cit> .

as with transcription factors  <cit> , the functional activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes must be regulated in order to produce gene expression patterns that are coherent with high-level biological processes, like development or tissue differentiation. however, little is yet known about how this regulation occurs, due to the recent discovery of these enzymes  <cit> . among the possible regulation levels  <cit> , like transcription, translation or mrna splicing, in this work we have focused on the study of the latter. we have chosen alternative splicing for four different reasons. first, because recent data  <cit>  strongly suggest that alternative splicing can introduce functionally relevant changes in chromatin-modifying enzymes. second, because alternative splicing is already known to play an important role in gene expression regulation by modulating the functional properties of transcription factors  <cit> , for example, alternative splicing can change the dna-binding properties of transcription factors  <cit> ; introduce or eliminate activating domains  <cit> , increase the in vivo stability of a given isoform  <cit> , etc. third, because of the availability, in public databases, of a large amount of unexplored information on alternative splicing patterns of chromatin-modifying enzymes is available in public databases. and fourth, because the functional and regulatory impact of the most frequent alternative splicing events -in particular long sequence insertions/deletions- is relatively easier to infer, particularly if it affects known protein domains  <cit> .

in our work we have studied  whether, and to which extent, epigenetic regulators  have alternative splicing, and  the impact of alternative splicing on the domain structure of these enzymes, with special focus on catalytic and interaction domains, which are known to play a key role  <cit> . we obtained the alternative splicing data from databases with very different curation protocols, going from literature surveys, like swissprot  <cit> , to that of highly automated methods based on sequence processing and est data, like ensembl  <cit> . our results show that a substantial percentage of epigenetic regulators,  <dig> % , have alternative splicing. in addition, in more than  <dig> % of these cases alternative splicing changes affect either the catalytic or the interaction domain , suggesting the existence of functional regulatory effects comparable to those found in transcription factors  <cit> .

RESULTS
a set of  <dig> genes, from different species, of chromatin-modifying enzymes was considered in this work. these enzymes cover the following activities: atp-dependent chromatin remodelling, histone acetylation, deacetylation, methylation, demethylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. we find  that  <dig> % of the genes show alternative splicing, with an average number of  <dig>  isoforms per gene. in humans, this number goes up to  <dig> % , a value close to one of the largest estimates obtained for human, e.g.  <dig> %  <cit> . this result points to a significant role of alternative splicing in the modulation of the functional properties of chromatin-modifying enzymes.

to characterise the functional variability introduced by alternative splicing in chromatin-modifying enzymes, we compared the different isoforms of the same gene at the protein sequence level, using the longest isoform as a reference. we focused our study on the changes affecting protein domains of known function, because they can be reliably interpreted in terms of biochemical/biological function  <cit> . for example, it has been experimentally shown that domain changes between isoforms can be associated to isoforms with  <cit> : a dominant-negative role, different binding affinities or new interaction partners, modified enzymatic activity, etc.

in our case, we observe that  <dig> %  of the genes with alternative splicing have isoforms with at least one missing, or significantly affected, domain . these cases can be grouped according to the functional role of the domain:  changes in the catalytic domains;  changes in the protein interaction domains; and  drastic sequence reductions. there are only four exceptions to this broad classification, corresponding to the small, single-domain, human proteins: ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2a , casein kinase  <dig>  alpha  <dig> polypeptide , nad-dependent deacetylase sirtuin- <dig>  and aurora kinase b  for which interaction and catalytic domains coincide. in these cases, alternative splicing modifications will affect both functions.

we discuss below the three above-mentioned scenarios.

 changes in the catalytic domains
in the human, we find several genes with isoforms that have the catalytic domain either missing or affected . in a short isoform of the histone methyltransferase suv39h <dig> , the catalytic unit is seriously damaged by the loss of the whole preset domain, and about  <dig> % of the set domain. the situation seems different for chromatin remodelling smarca1's and kinase prkdc's short isoforms, which only lack  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their respective catalytic domains . however, visual inspection of the catalytic domains' structures shows that the changes are far from being structurally neutral. the deletion affecting the helicase domain dexhc of the chromatin-remodelling enzyme smarca <dig> involves an alpha helix linking two of the most extreme strands of the central beta sheet . the deletion affecting the catalytic pi3_pi4_kinase domain of the kinase prkdc affects a beta sheet, eliminating one strand and altering the inter-strand connectivity . in both cases, the changes will produce either structural strain, or significant rearrangements, likely to result in function loss/modification. indeed, recent experimental data for kinase prkdc  <cit>  show that the protein kinase activity of the short isoform of this enzyme is lost.

inactivation of the enzyme's catalytic function by alternative splicing is also found in one of maize methyltransferase mez2's isoforms that has completely lost its set domain .

two cases deserve additional comment. carm <dig>  has an alternative splice isoform, the catalytic domain of which, skb <dig>  is clearly damaged . we have classed carm <dig> within this section, even though an interaction domain has not yet been identified, because the full-length isoform is big enough  to have both an interaction domain and a catalytic domain. the second case is that of rps6ka <dig>  which has two catalytic domains, but no interaction domain. in this case, lack of one of the catalytic domains may result in either an inactive or a less active protein. this situation would be equivalent to an amount regulatory mechanism similar to that described for other enzymes.

in general, alternative splicing isoforms with a missing catalytic domain may behave as dominant-negative regulators of the fully functional isoform, a well-known situation in the case of transcription factors  <cit> . this may be the case in chromatin-modifying enzymes. indeed, a recently described prkdc isoform with no protein kinase domain has no catalytic activity and shows slight inhibitory activity of the full-length isoform  <cit> . however, the situation may be more complex, as for example the short prkdc isoform described here is able to participate in some dna repair processes, despite having no kinase activity  <cit> . thus we cannot rule out the possibility that, in some cases, isoforms lacking the catalytic unit may have functional roles other than being dominant-negative regulators.

 changes in the protein interaction domains
as for the previous case, the effect of alternative splicing can range from partial deletion to complete domain loss . in the human, we find the latter in several genes, for example gcn5l <dig>  myst <dig> and morf4l <dig>  the first of them expresses two isoforms lacking the pcaf_n domain, which is involved in the interaction between the histone acetyltransferase gcn5l <dig> and cbp. for histone acetyltransferase myst <dig>  the chromodomain is lost together with a substantial part of the protein, but the catalytic domain is left intact. the case of the histone acetyltransferase morf4l <dig> is somewhat surprising, as it is the short isoform that shows the chromodomain, after deletion of a sequence stretch that is in the middle of the domain's sequence in the long isoform  <cit> .

in other cases the impact caused by alternative splicing changes is such that, from a functional point of view, it is essentially equivalent to a domain loss. in general, a simple measure, like size, is usually enough to understand the damaging nature of the change. this is the case of human histone methyltransferase suv39h <dig> that has an isoform with only  <dig> % of its chromodomain . the deleterious effect of this deletion on protein function is supported by visual inspection of the corresponding domain structure that points to a disruption of important secondary structure elements . interestingly, even small changes are likely to inactivate the domain's function. for example, chromatin remodelling smarca2's bromodomain only looses  <dig> % of its residues, but analysis of the three-dimensional structure shows that a relevant alpha helix from the helix bundle structure is lost, pointing to a disruption of such a small structure .

lack of a whole interaction domain is also found in other species, for example in the short isoform of the mouse histone acetyltransferase htatip , which has a missing chromodomain . it has to be noted that in this case a significant part of the protein is also missing . thus, while the catalytic domain, moz_sas, is preserved, it may happen that some unknown domains are also lost. interestingly, the case of the human histone acetyltransferase morf4l <dig> also appears in mouse.

in all these cases the a priori functional meaning of the loss of protein interaction domains is similar and would correspond to a down-regulation of the enzyme's activity. the underlying molecular mechanisms will vary depending on the nature of the interaction lost with the missing domain. if this interaction is required for the formation of a complex between the enzyme and its partners, necessary for the catalysis, down-regulation will result from the formation of inactive complexes. this is probably the case of the short isoform of histone acetyltransferase gcn5l <dig> 

if the missing domain is responsible for substrate targeting, e.g. a chromodomain or a bromodomain, down-regulation will be a consequence of the enzyme being unable to reach its substrate. however, in this case another option is also possible, as the enzyme could be recruited to its reaction site after binding one of its complex's partners. the resulting effect on the regulation of gene expression may be substantially different in this case, as modification of the histone tail will take place. however, lack of the chromatin-binding domain will eliminate the positive feedback in chromatin signalling. the latter is mediated by specific interactions between the modified histone tails and the corresponding enzymes and leads to self-perpetuation of activating marks on chromatin. this effect has been recently proposed for enzymes carrying the bromodomain  <cit> .

lastly, we also find instances where alternative splicing is likely to result in small modulatory changes. for example, in histone methyltransferase mll only one of the three phd domains is affected by alternative splicing. the small size of the change,  <dig> % of the domain, and the fact that the other two phd domains remain intact, points to a modulation of the enzyme's binding properties rather than to a complete inactivation. for c.elegans's histone acetyltransferase cbp- <dig>  the situation is similar as only one of the two copies of the protein interaction domain znf_taz is affected, by a small change that happens at a relatively neutral location .

 drastic sequence changes
generation of inactive isoforms constitutes a simple and powerful mechanism to regulate the amount of functional protein present in the cell  <cit> . usually, inactive isoforms are short versions of the fully active protein in which most functional domains are missing  <cit> . for several genes we find isoforms that fit this description and thus could be inactive isoforms . in all of them the size reduction relative to the active protein is dramatic, between  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and most of the functional domains are lost or seriously damaged. for example, in the case of the human kinase atm, the functional protein is  <dig> residues long, whilst there is a short isoform associated to this gene with only  <dig> residues . catalysis-associated domains like fat, fatc and pi3_pi4_kinase, are missing from the short isoform, together with most of the non-annotated parts of the sequence. it is improbable that such isoform may have any functional role itself and is thus likely to be the result of the above-mentioned regulatory process. we observe a similar situation for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> a , which has two isoforms lacking  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ubcc domain. the damaging effect of the missing sequence is supported by visual inspection of the corresponding domain structures .

in the "gene name" column we list the standard names of the proteins, although in some cases we also provide alternative names that are frequently used in the literature. in the "species" column h.s., m.m., d.m., c.e., o.s., x.l. and z.m. mean homo sapiens, mus musculus, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, oryza sativa, xenopus laevis and zea mays, respectively. the sizes of the different isoforms are given in amino acid number. *in this case, although the ank protein interaction domain is lost, the nfsp transcription factor binding domain is retained.

it has to be noted, however, that short isoforms may not always be the consequence of a regulatory process aiming at reducing the amount of functional protein. in some genes, for example in the case ankyrin- <dig>  <cit> , they have a specific functional role. this could also be the case for some of the transcripts mentioned in this section.

furthermore, we cannot completely discard the possibility that some of these cases correspond to database annotation errors.

CONCLUSIONS
a common effect of alternative splicing is to produce isoforms lacking a given functional domain, pointing to an inhibitory role of the fully functional isoforms  <cit> . this correspondence between alternative splicing and protein function changes is a consequence of the modular structure of protein function, having been experimentally demonstrated in different instances  <cit> . here we show that epigenetic regulators are no exception and that their alternative splicing patterns usually involve loss of the catalytic or the binding domain, resulting in short isoforms that could easily play the above-mentioned inhibitory role. they can also be the consequence of alternative splicing-based mechanisms for the regulation of product amount.

thus, our results show how alternative splicing may regulate the functional role of chromatin-modifying enzymes. this is a first step towards the goal of understanding the biological impact of alternative splicing on epigenetic gene expression regulation. this goal, which in general is very difficult to attain  <cit> , becomes particularly hard in our case, as epigenetic regulators act both at gene-specific and whole-genome levels  <cit> . they are involved in relevant biological processes like development  <cit>  or disease  <cit>  and, in addition, they may also act on proteins other than histones. nonetheless, our results clearly support the idea that alternative splicing is likely to have a substantial impact on the epigenetic regulation of large sets of genes, by regulating the activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes. one of the simplest mechanisms would be the co-expression of two alternative splice isoforms of one of these enzymes, a fully functional isoform and a dominant-negative inhibitor of the former, which may result in a reduced repression or activation of the set of genes controlled by this enzyme. to illustrate how this could happen, we can mention the case of g9a , a histone dimethyltransferase likely to play an important role in the repression of a large set of neuronal genes  <cit> . this repression, which can affect between  <dig> and  <dig> genes, is based on a chromatin-level mechanism  <cit>  :  nfsp transcription factor would recruit histone dimethyltransferase g9a to the target genes;  the latter would be silenced by g9a's dymethylation of histone tails at that location. it has been observed, that dominant-negative inhibition of g9a results in abrogation of this gene silencing  <cit> . in our case, we find that one of the g9a's isoforms has all the characteristics of a dominant-negative regulator , as it has lost all its domains but the binding domain to nfsp transcription factor. we can speculate that this isoform could modulate the repression of this set of neuronal genes, in a similar way as g9a dominant-negative designed constructs  <cit>  .
