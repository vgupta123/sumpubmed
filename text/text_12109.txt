BACKGROUND
recently, a comprehensive evaluation of  <dig> algorithms, for modeling transcription factor  sequence specificity in in vitro protein-binding microarray  data  <cit> , was published by dream <dig>  consortium. many interesting results were revealed through this work. for example, mononucleotide position weight matrices  methods perform similarly to more advanced dinucleotide pwm algorithms for modeling tf sequence specificity, and inferred binding energy-level of a motif has little effect on overall prediction accuracy. this study also briefly mentioned that pbm data quality may have a strong influence on algorithm performance across  <dig> mouse tfs. however, the actual data quality of the examined pbms in the dream <dig> challenge  is not investigated systematically. generally, the microarray experiment is known for containing many kinds of biases  <cit>  such as nonlinearity, saturation, and dynamic range problems for the signal intensity. in dream <dig> challenge, for a pair of training and testing pbm experiments, two different array designs were used for a mouse tf. however, 8-mers that were used to compute the 8-mer median intensities for every pbm are identical. this unique feature provides an opportunity to assess the pbm data quality  <cit> . for instance, if both training and testing pbm experiments in good data quality, then the observed 8-mer median intensities between the training and testing pbms will have good agreement. on the contrary, if one of the pbms yields poor data quality, then the 8-mer median intensities between two pbms will not match well. consequently, the testing prediction accuracy is not a true reflection of the algorithm performance if paired pbms have poor measurement agreements. in other words, computational algorithms will not predict a binding signal that only exists in the testing pbm experiment but it does not appear in the training pbm data, and vice versa. thus, it is important to develop pbm quality-control parameters that can evaluate the data quality for either single or paired pbms.

free-energy-based biophysical modeling tf sequence specificity, from detailed theoretical studies  to rapid computational development in real applications , have been investigated for many years and several computer programs are publically available now . recently, dependent energy correction such as dinucleotide interdependence was also incorporated into tf-binding energy by beeml-pbm and featurereduce  <cit> . in the dream <dig> challenge, performance of the dinucleotide-dependent model of the two new programs is not improved greatly over the simple energy-independent model . however, in many earlier studies, sequence dependencies in tf-binding sites were widely observed . particularly, energy-dependent model needs to fit a large number of unknown model parameters, which often encounters the over-fitting data problem that impairs the algorithm performance  <cit> . additionally, if the input data is large, then there is a memory issue to r and matlab programs which suffer from extremely slow computation . therefore, it is worthy to design a novel algorithm which implements the dependent energy correction in an efficient programming language. then, pbms of  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge can be reanalyzed by the new program. it may help revealing whether the limitation of previous algorithms hampers the discovery of motifs that contain nucleotide dependency in the binding sites.

motivated by the above-mentioned challenges, new quality-control parameters for both single and paired pbms, and a novel c implementation of biophysical modeling protein-dna interactions including dinucleotide interdependence  are presented here. the new methods and programs were applied on  <dig> mouse tfs in in vitro pbm experiments from the dream <dig> challenge. overall, four major questions are investigated in this work: 1) the true data quality of paired pbm experiments for  <dig> mouse tfs; 2) the association between the pbm data quality and the algorithm performance; 3) whether the binding energy-dependent model offers a great improvement over the simple energy-independent model in testing prediction accuracy; 4) whether the low binding energy-level of a motif is a real biological phenomenon or a bias due to the data quality and the algorithm limitation.

RESULTS
pbm data quality of two mouse tfs
the new pbm quality-control parameters were first tested at tf_ <dig>  and tf_ <dig> , since they are extreme cases in the previous algorithm performance comparison  <cit> . for example, in figure two of the original publication,  <dig> mouse tfs were sorted in decreasing order by the mean final algorithm performance scores, tf_ <dig> and tf_ <dig> were ranked as the first and the last tf, respectively. it suggests that the majority of evaluated algorithms performed significantly better at tf_ <dig> than at tf_ <dig> in the original study. in other words, the pbm data quality of tf_ <dig> may be much better than that of tf_ <dig>  thus, a quality analysis of the above-mentioned two tfs may tell the usefulness of new pbm quality-control parameters.

figures 1a and 1b show the ma plots  <cit>  of single pbm quality  for tf_ <dig>  and tf_ <dig> , respectively. in the ma plots, the higher the algorithm performance rank order of a tf, the longer the length of the major axis of the pca ellipse . the major axis of the pca ellipse is related to the orthogonal regression line between the background signal and pbm binding signal, which indicates the dynamical range of measured pbm signal intensities. if a pbm experiment has larger dynamical range, then better separation between the noise background signal and the true binding signal is achieved. consequently, a higher tf rank order will be obtained in algorithm performance evaluation. the present results support assumption that the longer the length of the major axis the better the pbm data quality.figure  <dig>

figure 1c and 1d illustrate the quality of paired pbms for tf_ <dig> and tf_ <dig>  by applying pca ellipse on the scatter plot of z-score transformed and log normalized 8-mer median intensities between the two pbms. in the scatter plots, the lengths of both the major and minor axes of the pca ellipse are quite different between tf_ <dig>  and tf_ <dig> . this is consistent with the previous hypothesis in single pbm experiment that the lengths of the major and minor axes reflect the dynamical range of pbm signal intensities, and the difference of 8-mer median intensities between paired pbms, respectively. put differently, if a paired pbms has good data quality , then a pca ellipse with long major axis but short minor axis will be expected. for paired pbms, correlation coefficients of normalized 8-mer median intensities are also quite different between the good-quality pbms  and the bad-quality ones . nevertheless, it is not an indicator of measurement agreement between the two pbms, because correlation coefficients measure the strength of a relationship between the two variables, and data with obvious poor agreement can produce high correlations  <cit> . therefore, the new pbm quality-control parameters not only provided a visual inspection of data quality for either single or paired pbms, but also suggested that tf rank order of algorithm performance comparison  <cit>  is associated with the data quality of both training and testing pbms.

pbm data quality of  <dig> mouse tfs
encouraged by the above observations, it is necessary to investigate all  <dig> tfs that have paired pbms. first, scatter plots of tf rank order vs. the single pbm  data quality are shown in figure  <dig>  where x-axis is the sorted rank order of  <dig> tfs based on the algorithm performance comparison in figure  <dig> of original paper  <cit> , and y-axis is the single pbm quality parameter for  <dig> training pbm experiments such as the length of the major and minor axes of the pca ellipse , correlation coefficient , and regression coefficient . a linear regression line was fitted to every scatter plot, where p-values to regression coefficients for the length of the major axis of the pca ellipse, the correlation coefficient, and the regression coefficient are p <  <dig> , p <  <dig> , and p <  <dig> , respectively. the results suggest that the quality of training pbm experiments is significantly correlated to the tf rank order of mean algorithm performance comparison. nevertheless, in a similar study by  <dig> testing pbm experiments, most of the single pbm quality parameters are not linked to the tf rank order additional file 1: figure s <dig>  except for the correlation coefficient between the signal intensities and the background intensities . it indicates that the algorithms may have been learning some background signals, since in general they performed best on training or testing sets where the signal and background intensities are highly correlated. for that reason, algorithm performance comparison of the original paper  <cit>  was swayed by the quality of pbm training data .figure  <dig> 
scatter plots of algorithm performance rank order versus pbm training data quality. a, b, c, and d show scatter plots of algorithm performance rank order of  <dig> mouse tfs versus the length of the major axis of the pca ellipse , the length of the minor axis of the pca ellipse, correlation coefficient between signal intensities and background intensities, and regression coefficients, respectively. both pca ellipse and regression coefficient are based on ma scatter plots for pbm training datasets. in the figure, the black smooth lines are fitted linear regression lines to the scatter plots, and the p-values of the regression lines are indicated at the top of each figure. the rank order of tfs  is adopted from figure  <dig> of the dream <dig> challenge paper.



then, scatter plots of tf rank order versus the paired pbm quality parameters are illustrated in figure  <dig>  where a linear regression line was fitted to each plot. p-values to the regression coefficients are p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for the length of the major axis , and minor axis  of the pca ellipse, the correlation coefficients , and the regression coefficients  of normalized 8-mer median intensities between training and testing pbms, respectively. the results are very interesting because all quality-control parameters of paired pbms are significantly correlated to the tf rank order according to the mean algorithm performance comparison. it appears that the deterioration of mean algorithm performance across the  <dig> tfs  is largely due to the decrease in agreement between the training and the testing pbms. specifically, computational methods for modeling tf sequence specificity are extremely sensitive to the data quality of both training and testing pbm experiments.figure  <dig>

classifying  <dig> mouse tfs into two groups based on pbm data quality
so far, the results of analyzing  <dig> mouse tfs imply that methods for modeling tf sequence specificity are strongly affected by the pbm data quality. it is better to group  <dig> tfs into two clusters  by pbm quality-control parameters, then to reevaluate the algorithm performance . as a consequence,  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge were assigned to two clusters by applying unsupervised fuzzy neural gas methods on the single pbm quality parameters . comparing to the known tf rank order from original work  <cit> , the best classifications were achieved by two parameters . that is consistent with the earlier observations in figure 2a and 2c. the clustering result is an average of ten times classifications based on the above-mentioned two-quality parameters, where cluster one contains more good-quality pbm experiments than that in cluster two. for example, ~79% of  <dig> tf that grouped in the first cluster belong to the top half of ranked tfs , and ~67% of  <dig> tf that assigned to the second cluster are in the bottom half of ranked tfs . in summary, the quality of training pbm experiments influences the algorithm performance comparison. in other words, the algorithm performance on testing data may be predicted by the corresponding training data quality.

then, the same  <dig> mouse tfs were classified into two clusters based on paired pbm quality parameters . a combination of different quality parameters  were tested, and the best classification was obtained by using the lengths of both the major and minor axes of pca ellipse, which characterize the dynamical range of pbm signal intensities and the difference of 8-mer median intensities between the two pbms, respectively. the average of ten times classifications of  <dig> tfs by the two parameters is shown in table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> for good and bad pbms, respectively. in the tables, tfs were evenly assigned to two clusters:  <dig> tf were grouped in cluster one  where ~79% of them have algorithm performance rank order from  <dig> to 33; and  <dig> tf were grouped in cluster two  where ~81% of them have algorithm performance rank order between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the results imply that the tfs of cluster one  were mostly measured by paired pbms with good data quality, but the tfs of cluster two  were frequently observed under poor-quality pbm experiments. particularly, the classification based on the agreement of paired pbms is much better than that done by single pbm data quality. it demonstrates that the quality of both training and testing pbms plays a pivotal role in evaluating algorithm performance for computational methods to model tf sequence specificity. thus, the new classification based on the agreement of paired pbms will be utilized in future data analysis.table  <dig>

in the table, the  <dig> tfs were classified by applying fuzzy neuronal gas algorithm on the paired pbm quality-control parameters , where a good agreement between training and testing pbms indicates good pbm data quality; rank means tfs are sorted in decreasing order of their final performance score across all tested algorithms in figure  <dig> of original publication  <cit> ; corrcoef , length, and number are pearson correlation between predicted intensities and testing probe intensities, the length of motif, the first or second motif, respectively;  and  represent bayespi <dig> energy-independent model and energy-dependent model including dinucleotide interaction, respectively; tfs marked by star and bold text indicate that the increase in pearson correlation coefficient is greater than  <dig>  by using bayespi <dig> energy-dependent model including dinucleotide interaction energies.



verification of bayespi <dig> energy-dependent model including dinucleotide interaction energies
in this study, biophysical modeling of protein-dna interaction with dinucleotide interdependency is implemented in c - bayespi <dig>  by using techniques similar to sparse bayesian learning and relevance vector machine. to test the new program, it was evaluated by two pbm datasets , which are known to contain nucleotide interdependent effects on the binding affinities of tfs  <cit> . first, the protein-binding energy matrices  of both egr <dig> and hnf4a were estimated, by applying bayespi <dig> on z-score transformed and log-normalized probe intensities of one of the replicate pbms . then, the predicted pbems were used to estimate the tf-binding intensities on the other replicate pbms. binding energy matrices predicted by the bayespi <dig> energy-independent model, which result in the highest correlation coefficient between the predicted intensities and the testing probe intensities, are shown in figure 4a and 4b for egr <dig>  and hnf4a , respectively. the best pbems calculated by bayespi <dig> dinucleotide energy-dependent model are displayed in figure 4c and 4d for egr <dig>  and hnf4a , respectively. the corresponding dinucleotide interaction energies are shown in the heatmaps, figure 4e and 4f. it is clear that bayespi <dig> energy-dependent model including dinucleotide interdependence improves testing prediction accuracy for both tfs. especially, for hnf4a, the improvement is striking , and the strongest dinucleotide interaction occurs at positions  <dig> and  <dig> , which is consistent with a previous study  <cit>  that applied beeml-pbm on the same data. it is worthy to note that the dinucleotide interactions often appear at tf-binding sites with low binding energy , please refer to figure 4c, d, e, and f. taken together, the new program - bayespi <dig> by including dinucleotide energy-dependent model performs well towards the real pbm data.figure  <dig>

applying bayespi <dig> on  <dig> mouse tfs 
both bayespi <dig> energy-independent model and dinucleotide energy-dependent model were applied on z-score transformed and log-normalized probe intensities of  <dig> training pbms  <cit> . the inferred tf-binding energy matrices were then used to evaluate prediction accuracies at  <dig> testing pbms from the same dream <dig> challenge  <cit> . results are shown in table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> for tfs with good-quality pbms and those with bad-quality pbms, respectively. the two groups were classified earlier based on the paired pbms quality parameters. for bayespi <dig> energy-independent model, the median correlation coefficients between testing probe intensities and bayespi <dig> predicted intensities are  <dig>  and  <dig>  in table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  respectively. a two-tailed t-test of correlation coefficients between table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> gives p-value  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which suggests that algorithm testing prediction accuracy from table  <dig>  is significantly better than that from additional file 1: table s <dig> . similar t-tests were carried out for algorithm performance scores  of  <dig> algorithms published by the dream <dig> challenge  <cit> , more than 85% of algorithms show significant better performance at good pbm quality group than that at poor pbm quality group . nevertheless, four algorithms seem to have little effect by the quality of pbms, where k-mer sequence-specific model plus feature selections were used .

notable, in table  <dig>   <dig> tfs are spread to almost  <dig> different dna-binding domains such as bhlh  and c2h <dig> . however, in additional file 1: table s <dig>   <dig> tfs just belong to  <dig> different dna-binding domains where almost half of them  are c2h <dig> dna-binding domain . it indicates that the poor quality of some pbm experiments  may be protein domain specific . additionally, if we only consider protein domains with more than two tfs from both table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  then there are three protein domains  that received a great boost in testing prediction accuracy  after using bayespi <dig> binding energy-dependent model. in other words, these three protein domains may more frequently encounter base pair interdependency in the dna-binding sites than that in the other domains.

results from both table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> reveal that the testing prediction accuracy based on energy-dependent model is very sensitive to the data quality, and the bayesian method is robust against the data noise. for example, by using the energy-dependent model of bayespi <dig> or beeml-pbm  <cit> , about  <dig> and  <dig> tfs show great improvement  in the testing prediction accuracy, respectively, over that by the simple energy-independent model; for the same test, no improvement was found by featurereduce. among the  <dig> tfs provided by beeml-pbm,  <dig> belong to the good-quality pbm group  where  <dig> tfs  were identified by bayespi <dig>  and the remaining  <dig> tfs are in the bad-quality pbm group  where only one tf  was recovered by bayespi <dig>  thus, by applying various algorithms on the pbms, the overlap of predictions is poor for tfs with bad-quality data but robust to tfs with good-quality ones. in summary, the better the pbm data quality, the better the testing prediction accuracy, and both the pbm data quality and the tf-binding site interdependency may be protein domain specific. especially, the good-quality pbm experiments generally benefit more from biophysical modeling of protein-dna interactions including dinucleotide interactions, than the poor ones from the same computation.

predicted tf-binding energy-level versus paired pbm data quality
encouraged by the above findings, it is interesting to investigate relationships between the predicted tf-binding energy-level of a motif and the pbm data quality across  <dig> tfs. first, for each tf, the median of negative binding energies of the first predicted binding energy matrix by bayespi <dig> energy-independent model was computed. then, a log-transformed absolute median energy value was used to summarize the binding energy-level of a motif, which is proportional to the information content of the motif. scatter plots of the log-transformed median tf-binding energy-level against the sorted paired pbm quality parameters such as the length of the major and minor axes of the pca ellipse, correlation coefficient and regression coefficient between training and testing pbms, are displayed in figure 5a, b, c, and d, respectively. a linear regression line was fitted to every scatter plot, p-value to the regression coefficient shows that the median binding energy-level of a motif is positively correlated to the length of the major axis of the pca ellipse  and the correlation coefficients , but anti-correlated to the length of the minor axis of the pca ellipse . results by applying bayespi <dig> energy-independent and dinucleotide energy-dependent model  are available in the , where almost all of them show significant positive correlation between the median binding energy-level of a motif and the paired pbms data quality, except for few cases  obtained by applying bayespi <dig> dinucleotide energy-dependent model on the pbm probe intensities. hence, the better the pbm data quality, the higher the binding energy-level  of a motif.figure  <dig> 
scatter plots of predicted binding energy-level in a motif versus sorted pbm quality parameters. a, b, c, and d are scatter plots of the median binding energy-level  in a motif predicted by bayespi <dig> versus sorted length of the major axis of the pca ellipse, sorted length of the minor axis of the pca ellipse, sorted correlation coefficients of normalized 8-mer median intensities between paired pbms, and regression coefficients, respectively. e, f, g, and h are scatter plots of the median binding energy-level  in a motif provided by the dream <dig> challenge versus sorted length of the major axis of the pca ellipse, sorted length of the minor axis of the pca ellipse, sorted correlation coefficients of normalized 8-mer median intensities between paired pbms, and regression coefficients, respectively. both pca ellipse  and regression coefficients are based on scatter plot of normalized 8-mer median intensities between a pair of training and testing pbm experiments. for  <dig> mouse tfs, the median binding energy-level of a tf is the log-normalized median of the negative energies ) in the binding energy matrix . in the figures, the black smooth line is a fitted linear regression line to the scatter plot, p-value to the regression line is shown at the top of each figure.



to verify the present finding, the same analysis was performed again on a set of pwms provided by the dream <dig> challenge  <cit> , where the pwms were predicted by various methods based on the same training pbm experiments for  <dig> mouse tfs. methods that were used to obtain those pwms include both biophysical free-energy models  and other model types . first, each pwm was converted to tf-binding energy matrix. then, scatter plots of log-transformed median binding energy-level of a pwm versus sorted paired pbm quality parameters were made . p-values of regression coefficients to the length of the major and minor axes of the pca ellipse, and the correlation coefficients are p <  <dig> , p <  <dig> , and p <  <dig> , respectively. it is clear that there is a strong positive correlation between the predicted binding energy-level of a motif and the pbm data quality. overall, the results of published pwms are consistent with the previous findings by using the bayespi <dig> predicted binding energy matrices. it reinforces the hypothesis that methods for modeling tf sequence specificity are extremely sensitive to the pbm data quality. specifically, the low energy-level  of a predicted binding energy matrix may be caused by the poor pbm data quality .

algorithm performance comparison and verification of predicted pbem in chip-seq data
a comparison of algorithm performance between the bayespi <dig> and the other methods was carried out, where the median pearson correlation coefficients  of  <dig> mouse tfs were computed for each algorithm . the correlation coefficients based on bayespi <dig> and  <dig> other algorithms were obtained from this study  and the earlier publication  <cit>  , respectively. a scatter plot of the sorted median pearson correlation coefficients for all algorithms is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> where the performance of bayespi <dig> is close to the top  <dig> ranked algorithms from the original paper. however, it should be noted that the present comparison may not tell the true merit of each algorithm because of the poor data quality in pbm experiments . for computational cost, bayespi <dig> takes ~7 min and ~30 min to predict one pbem  at a linux cluster machine by applying energy-independent model and energy-dependent models, respectively. however, for beeml-pbm, the same computer could not complete the prediction of one pbem  including dinucleotide interaction energies after running for almost 14 days with ~12 gb memory. taken together, the new program bayespi <dig> is an efficient and robust tool to analyze large data sets such as pbm.

subsequently, pbems of five mouse tfs obtained by bayespi <dig> based on in vitro data were used to predict tf occupancy data in the corresponding in vivo chip-seq data  <cit> . among the five mouse tfs, three  were classified as good-quality pbms  and the other two  were defined as poor pbms  in this study. results are shown in table  <dig>  and figure  <dig> , where a linear regression model was used to evaluate the significance of dependence between the inferred pbem from in vitro data and the measured tf tag counts from chip-seq experiment. for every in vivo data, the analysis was done at the top  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ranked peaks , and all called peaks, respectively. in each selection of the top-ranked peaks, the same amount of bottom-ranked peaks was also considered by the regression analysis. the results tell that there are significant correlations between the predicted tf-binding affinities and the measured tag counts across different sizes of input peaks, by using inferred pbems from two tfs with good pbm data quality . however, for the other two tfs  having poor pbm data quality, the significance of such dependence is weak and different among various sizes of input data. especially, both r-square statistic and t-values obtained from tfs with bad-quality pbms are much smaller than those provided by the good-quality ones. thus, poor pbm data quality may result in unreliable prediction of pbem , which hinders any subsequent genomic analysis. consequently, it leads to poor agreement between the estimated tf-binding affinities based on the pbem and the measured tf occupancy data from the in vivo data.table  <dig>

discussion
in this work, new quality-control parameters  were developed to assess the quality of pbm. both single and paired pbm data quality can be illustrated in a scatter plot, where predefined control limit  by pca quality-control ellipse gives a direct assessment of measurement attribute. for example, the lengths of the major and minor axes of the pca ellipse represent the dynamical range of pbm signal intensities, and the overall difference between paired pbms, respectively. for single pbm, algorithm performance at the testing data may be predicted for ~70% of tfs based on the corresponding training data quality. for paired pbms, a visual inspection of pca quality-control ellipse on the scatter plot can not only identify data outliers but also tell the robustness of agreement between the two observations. on the contrary, correlation coefficient is easily affected by the data outliers , which is not suited to measure agreement between paired observations  <cit> . based on the estimated pbm quality information for  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge, several interesting findings were revealed: for instance, both training data quality and paired pbms agreement  are significantly correlated to the tf rank order according to figure  <dig> of original publication  <cit> , where  <dig> tfs were sorted in decreasing order by the mean of final algorithm performance scores. the results indicate that the decrease in algorithm performances across  <dig> mouse tfs in the dream <dig> challenge is mostly due to the gradual reduction of pbm data quality, especially the poor agreement between training and testing pbms.

in addition to the new pbm quality-control parameters, a biophysical model of protein-dna interactions including adjacent dinucleotide interdependence was newly implemented in c – bayespi <dig>  where sparse bayesian learning approach was used to infer free-energy model parameters. the new energy-dependent model is able to recover known nucleotide interdependent effects on the binding affinities for egr <dig> and hnf4a, respectively. the results also reveal that dinucleotide interdependence often occurs at low binding energy  sites , which are significantly influenced by pbm data quality. particularly, the new bayespi <dig> dinucleotide energy-dependent model offers great improvement in testing prediction accuracy over the simple energy-independent model, for at least 21% of the analyzed mouse tfs . the new improvement might have resulted from more motif lengths searched by this study. alternatively, the over-fitting data problem, which hampers regression-based free-energy model  <cit>  to estimate a large number of unknown model parameters , is minimized by the bayesian implementation of nonlinear parameter fitting.

equipped with both the new quality-control parameters for paired pbms and the new free-energy model including dinucleotide interdependence,  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge were first classified into two groups  based on the agreement between training and testing pbms, then the algorithm accuracy on the test sets and the improvement by the energy-dependent model over the simple energy-independent model were compared between the two groups. four new observations were revealed by this work: 1) the algorithm testing accuracy at good-quality pbms is significantly better  than that at the bad-quality ones ; 2) the poor pbm data quality is protein domain specific because almost half of the bad-quality pbms  belong to c2h <dig> dna-binding domain ; 3) the improvement in algorithm testing prediction accuracy by using the energy-dependent model over that by the simple energy-independent model is not only associated with the pbm data quality, but also linked to the specific protein domains ; 4) the predicted binding energy-level  of a motif is significantly correlated to the quality of paired pbms .

from these four new discoveries, two  were observed in both the bayespi <dig> predictions and the original results from the dream <dig> challenge  <cit> . particularly, the predicted pbems from the good-quality pbms  performed significantly better than those inferred by the poor pbms , on subsequent genomic analysis in in vivo data such as chip-seq. nevertheless, there is a poor correlation between the inferred tf-binding affinities and measured chip-seq signals for tf_ <dig> , a putative good-quality pbm in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  this may be caused by the limitation of in vivo experiment. for example, chip-seq may not necessarily identify the direct tf-dna interactions  <cit> ), and tbx <dig> is known to directly interact with a number of proteins in regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the remaining two findings are supported by the literature evidences: 1) for protein domain specific pbm data quality, it is known  <cit>  that binding of c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins are often not well measured in pbm experiments because many c2h <dig> proteins do not bind specific dna sequences in pbm experiments; 2) for protein domain specific dinucleotide interdependence, two of the protein domains  were known to contain nucleotide dependence at the binding sites  <cit>  . therefore, both pbm data quality and computational modeling of protein-dna interactions are influenced by the specific protein domains, and certain protein domains may require a free-energy model including dinucleotide interdependence to obtain precise binding energy matrix. it is important to note that the associations of both the pbm data quality and the dinucleotide energy-dependence with the protein structure classes are only revealed by this study, after applying the new pbm quality-control parameters and bayespi <dig> 

to minimize the effect of pbm data quality on downstream data analysis, dna microarray experiment design from the previous works  <cit>  might be introduced. especially, triplet pbm experiments may be better than paired pbms design to distinguish the experimental failure  from the biological failure . an alternative computational solution, to the pbm data quality issue, is to integrate k-mer sequence specific model plus feature selections into the pwm energy model . that is because k-mer sequence specific model  does not consider the intensity values of pbms when learning the motif. it is robust against the data noise that may provide a good initial seed motif for regression-based free-energy model to estimate a precise pbem.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, both the new pbm quality-control parameters and the new biophysical modeling of tf-dna interactions including dinucleotide interdependence are developed during this work. by applying both methods on paired pbms for  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge, we found that: bayesian method is robust against the data noise, and mononucleotide pwm methods do not perform similarly to more advanced dinucleotide pwm algorithms for modeling tf sequence specificity. for instance, the bayespi <dig> energy-dependent model offers great improvement, for ~21% of the examined tfs, in the testing prediction accuracy over that by the simple energy-independent model. especially, the pbm data quality not only impacts the algorithm performance, but also influences the inferred binding energy-level of a motif ). this work may help tremendously for future research in developing computational methods and designing pbm experiments.
