BACKGROUND
maintaining high water quality standards is crucial, as water is essential to human health, development and well-being. the efficient operation and biological control of water distribution systems is important as high purity water , municipal and recreational water contaminated with waterborne pathogens such as non-fastidious gram-negative bacteria non enterobacteriaceae  can pose a serious risk to human health. water, and in particular hpw, is a vital component of both the clinical and many industrial manufacturing sectors such as the pharmaceutical, food and beverage and semiconductor industries  <cit> .

in healthcare facilities, such as neonatal units, intensive care units, dental practices and clinical diagnostics testing laboratories, water and hpw is routinely used for hand washing, bathing, cleaning semi-critical areas washing and rinsing patient medical devices and in the preparation and processing of medicines and other health products  <cit> . a recent traditional culture based microbiological study of water and water distribution systems in a number of hospital departments revealed high levels of contamination by gnb-ne  <cit> . in such settings, this microbial contamination with opportunistic pathogens could result in the transmission of healthcare associated infections  in immunocompromised patient groups  <cit> . there have been many reported cases of hcais associated with microbial contamination of water and hpw delivery systems and exposure to these water-borne pathogens in hospitals can result in increased patient morbidity and mortality  <cit> . it has also been observed that the use of biocontaminated water and hpw for clinical culture based microbiological diagnostics can result in the outbreak of pseudoepidemics  <cit> . such clinical derived pseudoepidemics can result in costly additional and unnecessary diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions for patients  <cit> .

in industrial settings, microbial contamination of water and hpw distribution systems can result in the biodeterioration of manufacturing equipment and as previous studies have demonstrated contamination with microorganisms can severely compromise the quality of industrial raw materials and finished products  <cit> .

previous studies have demonstrated that the microbial load present in water distribution systems can be significantly underestimated using the traditional plate count microbial culture method as a result of the presence of physiologically active bacteria that are unable to form colonies on culture media  <cit> . these viable but non-culturable bacteria may therefore be undetectable by standard microbial cultivation  <cit> . it has also been observed that variables such as the sampling technique and culture medium used can be crucial in obtaining accurate and reproducible results when testing these water samples  <cit> . such studies demonstrate the need for and importance of real-time monitoring for the onset of biocontamination of hpw purification units and hpw delivery systems by rapid microbial culture independent methods such that prompt remedial action may be undertaken.

therefore, there is a need to develop rapid, sensitive and high throughput methodologies for the quantitative detection and identification of biocontamination associated with hpw to ensure appropriate standards and quality can be achieved. nucleic acid diagnostics  technologies offer the potential to analyse in real-time the onset and progress of microbial biocontamination associated with hpw distribution systems. previously, we have reported the design and development of an internally controlled multiplex real-time pcr nad assay for both p. aeruginosa and burkholderia species for use in the quantitative detection and identification of these gnb-ne in biocontaminated hpw under laboratory conditions  <cit> . for the present study, additional novel nad targets for two more gnb-ne, s. maltophilia and s. marcescens have been incorporated resulting in a 5-plex real-time pcr nad assay, inclusive of an internal amplification control .

this study which was designed in accordance with minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time pcr experiments  guidelines  <cit>  describes a methodology combining water filtration, dna purification and nad technologies to detect, identify and absolutely quantify these common human pathogenic contaminates of hpw. furthermore, we have also demonstrated the developed methodology by testing a hpw delivery system supplied by a millipore elix  <dig> water purification unit distributing hpw based in a public building facility. the millipore elix  <dig> system uses both reverse osmosis and electrodeionization for production of hpw. using the developed methodology, we determined that the hpw delivery system was contaminated with the human pathogens, s. maltophilia and burkholderia species.

methods
bacterial strains, microbial culture media and growth conditions
ten stenotrophomonas species/strains,  <dig> burkholderia species,  <dig> pseudomonas species/strains and  <dig> serratia species/strains were used in this study . all target species/strains were purchased from either the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures  or from bccm belgian co-ordinated collections of microorganisms bacterial collection  .

all stenotrophomonas, burkholderia, pseudomonas and serratia species were grown in tryptone soya broth  or r2a broth  at either 30°c or 37°c for approximately  <dig> -  <dig> h or until sufficient growth was observed. for all other microorganisms tested in the study, total genomic dna was provided from microbial stocks held within this laboratory .

dna isolation and quantification
total genomic dna was isolated from overnight broth culture using the quick-gdna miniprep kit . briefly,  <dig>  ml of culture was centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge at  <dig>  g for two min. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl genomic lysis buffer by vortexing briefly, then incubated at room temperature for 5- <dig> min. subsequently, steps 2- <dig> of the purification of total dna from cell suspensions and proteinase k digested samples procedure were followed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines .

dna integrity was assessed on a 1% w/v agarose gel. concentrations for all total genomic dna used in this study were determined using the quant-it™ dsdna hs assay kit and the qubit fluorometer . all dna samples were stored at -20°c prior to use.

diagnostics target identification and development
the diagnostics target genes used in this study were identified by in silico evaluation of a number of genes currently under investigation and evaluation in this laboratory for use in nucleic acid based diagnostics test systems. these include the ssra, lepa, rnpb, 16s rrna, and genes and the  <dig> –  <dig> s rrna its. these gene targets have all previously been reported as useful species specific diagnostics targets for use in nucleic acid based diagnostics  <cit> . nucleotide sequence information was retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information  website , the functional gene pipeline and repository website , the rnasep database  and the tmrna databse . alignments of these nucleotide sequences were carried out using the clustalw <dig> multiple sequence alignment programme .

nucleic acid diagnostics target sequencing
nucleotide sequence data used for real-time pcr nad assay design and development was obtained either from publicly available databases or were generated in this study. sequencing primers  were designed to amplify the ssra gene of stenotrophomonas, and serratia species. amplification of the ssra gene of p. aeruginosa and the rnpb gene of burkholderia species was performed as previously described  <cit> . conventional pcr products were generated as described above, followed by purification using the high pure pcr product purification kit . the purified pcr products were sequenced externally .

internal amplification control for multiplex real-time pcr nad assay
the iac used in this multiplex real-time diagnostics assay as previously described  <cit>  was developed using a modified version of the composite primer approach  <cit> . briefly, the iac amplifies and detects a chimeric pcr product containing nucleotide sequence of both candida albicans als <dig> gene and the aqualysin  <dig> gene from thermus aquaticus.

real-time pcr
real-time pcr nad assays were initially tested in a monoplex format to determine the specificity and analytical sensitivity. monoplex real-time pcr reactions were performed on the lightcycler  <dig>  instrument using the lightcycler taqman master kit . each monoplex reaction contained 5x master mix , forward and reverse primer , probe ,  <dig>  u uracil-dna glycosylase , 5% v/v dimethyl sulphoxide , template dna  and the volume adjusted to  <dig> μl with the addition of nuclease-free water. the thermal cycling parameters consisted of  <dig> min at 37°c to incubate udg followed by  <dig> min incubation at 95°c to deactivate udg, activate the polymerase and denature the template dna. subsequently,  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s and 60°c for  <dig> s were performed, with a final a cooling step at 40°c for  <dig> s. the temperature transition rate for all cycling steps was 20°c/s.

for multiplex real-time pcr the s. maltophilia, burkholderia species and p. aeruginosa specific probes were labelled with cyan  <dig>  fam, hex and black hole quencher  <dig>  respectively. the s. marcescens probe was labelled with rox and black hole quencher  <dig> . the iac assay probe was labelled with tye <dig> and iowa black® rq-sp . the multiplex real-time pcr nad assay was optimised to the required standards routinely used in this laboratory and the specificity and analytical sensitivity was determined.

multiplex real-time pcr reactions were subsequently performed using the lightcycler  <dig> probes master kit  on the lightcycler  <dig> system i. each multiplex reaction contained  <dig> x master mix , forward and reverse primers  cyan <dig>  fam, hex, rox and tye <dig> probes , udg , dmso . template dna  and iac dna  were added to each reaction mix. nuclease-free water was added to a final volume of  <dig> μl. a no template control reaction was included in each experiment. the cycling parameters used for multiplex reactions were in accordance with monoplex parameters . the temperature transition rate, referred to as the ramp rate on the lightcycler  <dig>  was  <dig> °c/s while heating and  <dig> °c/s on cooling. as outlined by the manufacturer  <cit>  a colour compensation file was generated prior to experimental analysis to avoid fluorescence leakage between channels.

determining the specificity of the multiplex real-time diagnostic assay
to demonstrate the specificity of the designed multiplex real-time pcr nad assay, it was tested against genomic dna isolated from a panel of  <dig> microorganisms  at a concentration of  <dig> genome equivalents  per reaction. genome sizes were available from the ncbi website for all microorganisms of interest and were used to calculate the ge of each microorganism tested using previously published guidelines  <cit> .

analytical sensitivity of the multiplex real-time diagnostic assay determined using probit regression analysis
the analytical sensitivity of each assay in multiplex format was established by testing twelve replicates of eight bacterial genomic dna concentrations, using probit regression analysis  <cit> . to determine the impact of genomic dna from other microorganisms commonly associated with biocontaminated hpw distribution systems the lod was also investigated in the presence of a background of pooled genomic dna from  <dig> other bacteria commonly associated with water system contamination  <cit> . the final total concentration of the pooled bacterial genomic dna was  <dig> ge per reaction. these bacteria were klebsiella pneumonia dsm  <dig>  ralstonia sp. dsm  <dig>  enterobacter aerogenes nctc  <dig>  proteus mirabilis dsm  <dig>  staphylococcus aureus dsm  <dig>  acinetobacter baumannii dsm  <dig>  bacillus cereus dsm  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> of the following s. maltophilia dsm  <dig>  b. cepacia dsm  <dig>  p. aeruginosa dsm  <dig> and s. marcescens dsm  <dig> . the iac, at a concentration of  <dig> plasmid equivalents per reaction, was also included in all samples during sensitivity testing.

generation of external standard curves
three overnight microbial cultures of either s. maltophilia, burkholderia species , p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens grown in r2a broth with an optical density at  <dig> nm  of  <dig>  were serially diluted tenfold  in sterile phosphate buffered saline  . one hundred μl of each dilution were spread on r2a agar and incubated for  <dig> h at 30°c. these plates were used to count cfu. dna was isolated from two hundred μl aliquots from each dilution  using the quick-gdna miniprep kit  as per protocol outlined above. dna was eluted in  <dig> μl sterile nuclease free water which was then used as template dna in the multiplex real time pcr reaction. standard curves were derived by plotting threshold cycle  values against overnight plate counts ).

sampling from hpw delivery system for microbiological analysis
an elix  <dig> hpw purification unit  and hpw delivery system based in a public building facility was investigated for bacterial contamination. the last full service of the elix  <dig> hpw purification unit was carried out approximately  <dig> months prior to first sampling. sampling of hpw was performed at two point of use sources. sampling point a was an outlet valve adjacent to the elix  <dig> hpw purification unit and point b was a laboratory tap approximately  <dig> -  <dig> m from the elix  <dig> hpw purification unit. during the course of this study the elix  <dig> hpw purification unit had a new progard tl <dig> system cl <dig> autoclean pretreatment pack and the q-gard tl polishing pack fitted. samples of the hpw were subsequently taken from both points after this process was carried out. before taking hpw samples, the outlets exteriors were cleaned with 70% ethanol, and hpw was subsequently allowed to flow for  <dig> min . five litre samples were collected into sterile containers and filtered using  <dig>  μm,  <dig> mm cellulose nitrate/acetate membrane filters   <cit> . each filter was placed in  <dig> μl genomic lysis buffer  and incubated on rotating platform at room temperature for  <dig> -  <dig> min followed by steps  <dig> -  <dig> of the total dna isolation from cell suspension procedure according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. the dna was eluted in  <dig> μl sterile nuclease free water.

heterotrophic plate counts  were performed by plating  <dig> μl of hpw onto r2a agar and incubating at 37°c for  <dig> h. additionally,  <dig> μl samples of hpw were plated on four selective agars. these were pseudomonas agar, l-arabinose ornithine irgasan medium  <cit> , b. cepacia medium, and b. cepacia specific agar .  at 30°c for  <dig> h). plates were incubated at 30°c for  <dig> h. single colonies were isolated and these microbial cultures were used to inoculate the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter id system panels , which were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. results were evaluated using bbl crystal id system electronic codebook.

 rapid nad quantitative detection and identification of bacteria from a biocontaminated hpw delivery system.

total genomic dna isolated from filtered hpw samples was used as template dna in the developed multiplex real-time pcr nad assay to determine if the hpw samples were contaminated with s. maltophilia, burkholderia species, p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens. in order to determine the degree of contamination of the hpw delivery system with these bacteria each positive result was absolutely quantified by comparison to one of the established external standard curves generated as described in section generation of external standard curves.

discussion
the use of rapid quantitative multiplex real-time pcr nad assays for the analysis of microbial contamination in water and hpw distribution systems can potentially overcome some of the limitations that are associated with conventional culture based microbiological diagnostics techniques traditionally used to monitor water quality. conventional microbial analysis of water and hpw distribution systems by traditional culture techniques are labour-intensive and can take between  <dig> -  <dig> days, which can result in significant delays in identifying the contaminating microorganism  <cit> . furthermore, conventional microbial culture methodologies traditionally used to analyse the biocontamination of water and hpw distribution systems assess the number of bacteria that can form visible colonies on a solid medium under specific test growth conditions . however, these approaches only reveal the presence of bacteria culturable under these conditions and may not grow all the contaminating microorganisms present  <cit> . therefore, monitoring water quality by hpcs enumeration with conventional microbial culture methods may only represent a relatively small proportion of the total viable microbial population in a biocontaminated water or hpw distribution system  <cit> .

it is possible that the use of nad technologies such as real-time pcr for the analysis of microbial contamination in water and hpw distribution systems could result in the detection of dna from dead microorganisms. this may result in an overestimation of the microbial contamination or the risk of false positive results. however, the presence of any dna from pathogenic microorganisms in a water sample indicates that there is biological contamination within the system. any contamination with pathogenic microorganisms within water distribution systems even if present at low concentrations should be considered a risk.

in a healthcare setting, if the water or hpw distribution system is suspected as a potential source of hcais, the ability to specifically detect and identify pathogenic microorganisms rapidly would allow the required infection control and prevention measures to be taken promptly. a delay in this analysis could result in an increased risk of patients contracting hcais and subsequently a significant increase in both the duration and cost of a healthcare stay. in this setting, where there is an increasing proportion of immunologically compromised patients there is added potential for infection by pathogenic microorganisms originating from biocontaminated water and hpw distribution systems. a recent commentary on waterborne pathogen detection  <cit>  highlights that although hospital water and hpw distribution systems have been implicated in the spread of hcais there is a lack of evidence of direct transmission from water distribution systems. however, it concludes that a microbiological investigation of the hospital water distribution system, such as that performed by cristina et al.  <cit> , may be beneficial in identifying the position, frequency and extent of contamination. such analysis could then be used to assess the degree of risk to patients. therefore an ability to specifically detect and identify pathogenic microorganisms in the hpw distribution system rapidly may aid in determining the potential source and causative agent of the hcais, thereby allowing the required infection control and prevention measures to be taken promptly.

in this current study the internally controlled novel multiplex real-time pcr diagnostics assay developed uses nad targets for the rapid specific quantitative detection and identification of four important human pathogenic bacteria associated with the contamination of hpw distribution systems  <cit> . the developed multiplex real-time pcr nad assay was determined to be 100% specific when tested against a panel of  <dig> microorganisms with no cross reactivity observed . to our knowledge, this is the first report of an internally controlled 5-plex assay for the quantitative detection and identification of s. maltophilia, burkholderia species, p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens for use in the microbial analysis of a hpw distribution system.

the analytical sensitivity of all four diagnostics assays described in this study is less than  <dig> ge allowing for the potential detection of low levels of pathogenic bacteria present in a biocontaminated hpw distribution system. the 5-plex pcr nad assay described does not require microbial culture pre-enrichment of the hpw sample to increase analytical sensitivity prior to running the diagnostics assay. this ability to detect contaminating microorganisms without microbial culture pre-enrichment is a significant advantage, as the inclusion of a microbial culture pre-enrichment step eliminates the ability to absolutely quantify the contaminating microorganism in the hpw. this is important as routine testing of hpw needs to be both qualitative and quantitative  <cit> . another major advantage of not including a pre-incubation step is that the assay tat is significantly reduced. using the developed multiplex real-time pcr nad assay, the tat to result inclusive of hpw sampling and filtration, dna preparation, real-time pcr reaction, and data analysis is <  <dig> h in contrast to 2- <dig> days using traditional microbial culture diagnostics methodologies  <cit> .

a hpw delivery system supplied by an elix  <dig> hpw purification unit was evaluated for microbiological contamination using both traditional microbial culture methodologies and the developed nad assay and associated methodology. this analysis was performed both before and after a pretreatment and polishing pack change of the millipore elix  <dig> hpw purification unit. the developed multiplex real-time pcr nad assay determined that the hpw delivery system was contaminated with the opportunistic human pathogens s. maltophilia and burkholderia species. the numbers of both of these gnb-ne present in the hpw distribution system was above the action level threshold of  <dig> cfu/ <dig> ml recommended by both european and us guidelines  <cit> . the presence of both s. maltophilia and burkholderia species in the hpw delivery system was also confirmed by traditional microbial culture methods using the bbl crystal enteric nf system . neither p. aeruginosa nor s. marcescens was detected in the hpw using the developed nad test or by traditional microbial culture methods.

this current study, which was designed in accordance with miqe guidelines  <cit> , has focused on the development of a rapid methodology for the absolute quantification, detection and identification of four pathogenic bacteria from an operating hpw distribution system. other studies have demonstrated that biocontamination of water and hpw distribution systems can occur with a number of other important human pathogenic microorganisms which were not investigated in this study  <cit> . we propose that with the inclusion of additional nad tests, this methodology could be used to detect and identify a more comprehensive panel of pathogenic microorganisms  for use in the analysis of microbial contaminants of water and hpw distribution systems. while the developed rapid culture independent methodology was demonstrated using a limited number of samples from a hpw distribution system the same methodology could be applied to other water and hpw distribution systems such as those in a clinical setting. we intend to evaluate a number of other water and hpw distribution systems over a longer period to further demonstrate the robustness of the developed methodology.

CONCLUSIONS
as water and hpw is routinely used for a wide range of applications in the clinical and industrial sectors, it is essential that water purification units and water distribution systems are subject to strict maintenance schedules and stringent microbiological analysis. the rapid culture independent methodology described here may be a valuable diagnostics tool and have many useful applications in both these sectors.
