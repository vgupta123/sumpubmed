BACKGROUND
bronchial asthma, one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases, has complex pathogenic mechanisms. as an allergic disease, it is mediated mainly by th <dig> immune responses, and is affected by genetic as well as environmental factors. many approaches for treating this disease are palliative rather than disease modifying. in the past century, antigen-specific immunotherapy  has been widely practiced in treating allergic diseases, and has been a form of disease-modifying treatment, which has been demonstrated to be clinically efficacious in asthma  <cit> . however, the sit desensitizers commonly used presently are whole allergen preparations that have the potential to induce a series of adverse allergic events that can, at times be fatal  <cit> . on this basis, many approaches that can reduce the allergenicity of immunotherapy preparations and maintain their immunogenicity are under development. one of these approaches is peptide immunotherapy , which utilizes synthesized short peptides containing major t cell epitopes of the allergen. this approach could present allergen-derived t cell epitopes while avoiding the immunoglobulin e  mediated mast cells or basophils. synthesized short peptides containing major t cell epitopes of cat allergen fel d <dig>  dust mite allergen der p <dig>  birch pollen allergen bet v <dig> and bee venom allergen api m <dig> have been demonstrated to be efficacious in experimental animal models in recent years  <cit> .

clinical studies have also shown that in patients allergic to cats, rhinitis symptom scores, asthma symptom scores, and lung function were all improved markedly after peptide treatment  <cit> . however, some conflicting results were also reported. janssen et al.  <cit>  found that ova323- <dig> peptides containing major t cell epitopes of ovalbumin  proteins do not mitigate the effects of airway inflammation, but conversely, aggravate disease in ova-induced asthmatic mice. the same result has been observed in encephalomyelitis  mice model. wegman et al. <cit>  found that plp139- <dig> peptide  monomers had no effect in improving disease, while synthesized plp139- <dig> multiple antigen peptide  octamers successfully inhibited the occurrence of eae induced by encephalitis pathogenic protein, thus demonstrating that peptide monomers processing can alter their immunological characteristics.

maps are dendriform peptides, which can be tetramers or more typically, octamers. each peptide monomer is independently and covalently linked to a branched central lysine matrix. maps can induce high levels of immune response and have been used in vaccine development for a variety of infectious diseases  <cit> . in addition, maps can also enhance the peptide-specific t cell response and play a role in the protective immune response  <cit> . also, wegman et al. <cit>  further expanded the scope of maps application in studies of autoimmune diseases. there have been no reports of studies concerning the treatment of allergic airway inflammation using maps. therefore, in the present study, eight ova323- <dig> short peptides were integrated on a lysine core matrix to constitute ova323-339map octamers, which were then subcutaneously injected into ova-induced allergic airway inflammation mice. the inhibitory effect of ova323-339map on airway inflammation and th <dig> immune response were observed and compared with ova323- <dig> monomers.

based on the current theories, t regulatory  cells proliferation is crucial in maintaining homeostasis. however, existing research on the role of treg cells in pit treatment remain controversial  <cit> . in our preliminary study, we found that treg cells played an important immunoregulatory role in the development and progression of airway inflammation in mice  <cit> . thus, the changes of treg cells after ova323- <dig> map octamer treatment were further explored in this study.

RESULTS
ova323-339map intervention attenuates ova-induced airway inflammation
recently, maps have been shown to alleviate the severity and block the progress of eae  <cit> . this finding emphasizes the potential of maps intervention as an effective immunotherapy to treat antigen-specific allergic diseases. thus, to examine the impact of maps on allergic lung disease, we sensitized balb/c mice with ova emulsified in al <dig> and induced airway inflammation by intranasal administration of the antigen. as illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig> a, ova priming and activation led to a high inflammation score associated with marked peribronchial leukocyte infiltration, edema, and epithelial damage. systemic administration of regular ova323- <dig> peptide before local antigen activation did not alter the severity of the airway inflammation and tissue injury, whereas treatment with ova323-339map substantially reduced the inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner. in addition to the histological evaluation, we assessed airway inflammation by examining total cell counts and eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocytes and macrophages counts in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid  of these mice. compared to the normal control group, ova sensitization and challenge induced a significant increase of total cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages counts, ova323- <dig> peptide monomers intervention mildly reduced the total cell count and eos number. however, a significant decrease in total cell as well as eos and lym infiltrates was observed in ova323-339map treated mice .

antigen specific immunoglobulin e  plays an important role in allergic cell degranulation and hyperresponsiveness. therefore, we tested whether maps intervention altered immunoglobulin production and switching. as shown in figure  <dig> b, no ova-sige was detected in the serum of control animals, whereas ova challenge led to a robust production of ige that specifically recognizes ova. conversely, ova323-339map treatment significantly suppressed the level of ova-sige. interestingly, the mice administered with ova323-339map had a substantial elevation of ova-specific immunoglobulin g <dig>  which is the indicator for the success of immunotherapy, compared to the control and ova323- <dig> peptide monomers treated groups . this data suggest that ova323-339map intervention may mitigate the antigen-specific allergic process and response.

based on the above results, we further explored how the ova323-339map mitigates the airway allergic airway.

ova323-339map intervention alters the ova-induced th <dig> response
it is well documented that ova-induced airway inflammation in balb/c mice is mainly mediated by a th <dig> response. in light of the finding that ova323-339map can attenuate allergic airway inflammation, we asked if ova323-339map treatment alters the ova-induced th <dig> response in the host. to this end, we measured the expression of th1/th2-related cytokines  and the ratio of ifn-γ/il- <dig> in the balf of these mice. the levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were significantly elevated in mice challenged with ova , while the ratio of ifn-γ/il- <dig> decreased significantly . however, ova323-339map intervention reduced local th <dig> cytokines production and increased the level of ifn-γ and the ratio of ifn-γ/il- <dig> . furthermore, in order to determine if ova323-339map treatment influences antigen recall response in mice sensitized with ova, splenocytes from control and ova-challenged mice with or without ova323-339map intervention were harvested. the il- <dig> and ifn-γ positive populations were analyzed by flow cytometry  in cd4+ t cells and the amount of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ in the cell culture media were quantified by elisa. when the lymphocytes were re-stimulated with ova in vitro, cd4+ t cells from ova-challenged mice exhibited a significantly higher il- <dig> production than the control group. in vivo treatment with ova323-339map virtually blocked th <dig> cytokines production in response to ova re-stimulation . likewise, elisa demonstrated that splenocytes from ova-challenged mice exhibited a significantly higher il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> response to antigen re-stimulation, while this antigen recall response was diminished in ova323-339map-treated mice . interestingly, ova323-339map intervention caused more ifn-γ products while the levels of ifn-γ between the control and airway inflammation groups were biologically insignificant . these results suggest that ova323-339map may alter th <dig> response in this allergic airway model.

ova323-339map intervention increased the populations of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells, up-regulated the production of il- <dig>  membrane-bound tgf-β <dig> and foxp <dig> in the lung, as well as the surface expression of pd- <dig> and ctla-4

in light of these findings, we evaluated whether ova323-339map induces peripheral tolerance as a part of a potential mechanism for mitigating ova-induced airway inflammation. treg cells regulate the functions of other cd4+cd25- effector cells and play an important role in balancing th1/th <dig> cell differentiation. therefore, we observed the alteration of treg cells. cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells in peripheral blood, mediastinal draining lymph nodes, and spleen were measured by fcm. in vivo ova challenge decreased the level of treg cells in the mice. however, ova323-339map increased the population of local and peripheral cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells approximately  <dig> - <dig>  fold . in addition, we further detected the foxp <dig> transcription expression in the lung to observed treg cells in inflamed local tissue. the result showed that foxp <dig> expression in the lung was augmented by maps intervention .

cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells exert their regulatory effect on immune effector cells by both direct contact and indirect suppression. the indirect suppression is mediated by anti-inflammatory cytokines including il- <dig> and transforming growth factor -β <dig>  thus, we measured il- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> levels in balf and their expression in lung tissue. as shown in figure  <dig> f and i, ova challenge significantly decreased the level of il- <dig> in balf and lung tissue, but ova323-339map intervention increased its concentration. although the level of tgf-β <dig> in balf was not affected by maps , the transcription of tgf-β <dig> in lung was significantly decreased in ova challenge mice when compared to control mice. however, it is important to note that ova323-339map intervention could reverse this change which is consistent with the results shown in our previous publication   <cit> .

cell-cell contacting is the other mechanism of treg function, co-stimulatory molecules such as programmed death - <dig> and cytotoxic t lymphocyte associated antigen - <dig> contribute to the regulatory function of treg cells. therefore, we investigated the expression of pd- <dig> and ctla- <dig> on the surface of treg cells by fcm. interestingly, compared to the control mice, ova challenge elevated the expression of pd- <dig> mildly, however, the ratio of pd-1+ treg cells increased significantly after treatment with ova323-339map in blood, mediastinal draining lymph nodes, and spleen. the similar alteration of ctla- <dig> expression on the surface of treg cells was observed in same tissues .

to further assess the function of treg cells in these mice, we isolated cd4+cd25+ treg cells from ova-challenged mice, with or without ova323-339map treatment. the treg cells were co-cultured with effector cd4+ lymphocytes and cd11c+ antigen presenting cells  from the normal untreated mice. five days later, effector t cells proliferation in response to in vitro ova stimulation was assessed by fcm. the results showed that effector t cells underwent six proliferation cycles when they were cultured with treg cells from ova-challenged mice, the same as that of effector t cells without treg. despite ova challenge, the treg cells from the mice treated with ova323-339map displayed a regulatory function, as evidenced by reduced effector t cell proliferation cycles .

discussion
the ova323- <dig> peptides used in this experiment contained major t cell epitopes, representing major peptides that could be presented to th cells through mhc class ii molecules after apcs processing of ova proteins. structural analysis has confirmed that ova323- <dig> peptides contain multiple loci that can be combined with mhc class ii molecules and tcrs to form an immune sandwich complex and induce an immune response  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that after ova323- <dig> peptide challenge, 82% of ova-sensitized mice developed immediate hypersensitivity. in addition, ova and ova323- <dig> peptides are equivalent in increasing mice airway reaction during challenge test  <cit> . thus, ova323- <dig> peptides have been considered for use in pit in ova-induced asthma in mice. however, janssen et al. <cit>  found that after using these peptides for immunotherapy in mice, neither airway inflammation was alleviated nor were ova-sige levels and th <dig> immune responses suppressed, which are the opposite of the expected results. in our study, similar results were found using ova323- <dig> peptide monomers, while after ova323-339map intervention, airway inflammation in mice was significantly alleviated and eos infiltration decreased markedly. these results suggest that ova323-339map, instead of ova323- <dig> peptide monomers have a significant antagonizing effect on airway inflammation. the previous reports confirmed that the branching lysine core is an immunologically silent dendrimeric structure  <cit> , therefore, the effects of maps were not caused by the lysine core.

in addition, the effect of ova323-339map on airway inflammation was dose-dependent. in clinical study, it has been suggested that a high-dose antigen can induce t cell unresponsiveness and also trigger apoptosis of th <dig> cells in allergen stimulated periphery blood mononuclear cell  from patients receiving sit treatement  <cit> . further analysis found that after maps intervention, the level of ova-sige in periphery blood was significantly reduced, while ova-sigg <dig> level was significantly increased. these results indicated that ova323-339map intervention could affect the class-switch of ova-specific immunoglobulin. clinical trials have shown that allergen-sige level gradually decrease in allergic patients as a successful treatment proceeds, while the levels of siggs, especially igg <dig> and igg <dig> gradually increase  <cit> . therefore, immunoglobulin class-switch is considered to be one of the important indicators reflecting the success of immunotherapy  <cit> . these results also showed that ova323-339map could alter the immunological characteristics of monomer peptides after polymerization and possessed the opposite effect to peptide monomers. wegman’s study <cit>  also supported this conclusion. they found that plp139-151map instead of plp139- <dig> peptide monomer applied for intervention in encephalitogenic proteolipid protein plp139- <dig> peptide-induced eae mice could prevent antigen-specific t cells trafficking into the brain, thereby inhibiting inflammation. our study showed that ova323-339map suppressed th <dig> immune response; reduced il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> levels in either balf or splenocyte culture supernatant significantly as well as the ratio of th <dig> cells in spleen concurrently. up-regulated ratio of ifn-γ/il- <dig> reflected that maps could affect the th1/th <dig> immune balance by inhibiting th <dig> cell differentiation and th <dig> immune responses.

it is well documented that treg cells are essential for regulating immune effector cells, balancing th1/th <dig> response. they are a marker of tolerance induction in controlling autoimmune diseases and maintaining immune tolerance. cd4+cd25+ cells are a well characterized treg population and possess potent immunosuppressive functions. thus, we examined the quantity of treg cells in our model. the results showed that ova323-339map intervention significantly increased the ratio of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells in peripheral blood, mediastinal draining lymph nodes, and spleen of mice. transcription factor foxp <dig> is not only highly expressed in treg cells, but also correlated with treg activation. thus, we further detected the level of transcription factor foxp <dig> in the lung tissue by real-time pcr to evaluate the effect of treg cells in lung tissue. the results indicated that the expression of foxp <dig> is augmented significantly in maps treated mice. il- <dig> is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by treg cells. cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells exert their anti-inflammatory effect through il- <dig>  which also promotes the conversion of cd4+cd25- treg cells to cd4+cd25+ treg cells. il- <dig> suppresses t cells by blocking cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and inducible costimulatory molecule  signals through a rapid signal transduction cascade, leading to t cell tolerance. il- <dig> can also down-regulate the expression of mhc class ii molecules and costimulatory molecules of monocytes and dcs, thus inhibiting the antigen-presenting function of these cells. in addition, il- <dig> could also regulate the humoral immune response by promoting class-switch of immunoglobulin and up-regulating igg production  <cit> . in the patients receiving pit of bee venom or cat allergen, the il- <dig> levels significantly increased  <cit> . for this reason, we further observed the changes of il- <dig> levels in different groups. our study showed that ova323-339map could increase the il- <dig> level in ova challenge mice to a normal level, indicating that inducing il- <dig> secretion may be one of the functions of ova323-339map. besides its tolerance-inducing capability, peptide immunotherapy-induced il-10-dependent immune tolerance correlates to inhibition of the “linkage epitope” response  <cit> . in our study, subcutaneous injection of ova323-339map could alleviate airway inflammation development and th <dig> immune response in mice challenged by the ova protein, suggesting that ova323-339map therapy could inhibit in vivo immune response to the entire ova protein.

it is acknowledged that tgf-β <dig> could induce the conversion of naïve cd4+cd25- t cells into cd4+cd25+ t cells by up-regulating foxp <dig> expression, and play an important role in enhancing the immunosuppressive capacity of cd4+cd25+ t cells  <cit> . interestingly, the levels of tgf-β <dig> in balf of each group did not have marked differences, while tgf-β <dig> transcription level in the lung of ova323-339map group was increased when compared with the ova group. the same phenomenon had been observed in our previous study, suggesting that membrane-bound tgf-β <dig> in cd4+cd25+ treg cells was elevated  <cit> . some reports have demonstrated that treg cells could induce immune tolerance by cell-cell contacting directly with membrane-bound tgf-β <dig> being essential for this regulation, and it also could mitigate allergic airway inflammation through a notch1-mediated mechanism  <cit> . it has been reported that pd- <dig> and ctla- <dig> contribute to the suppressive activity of allergen-specific regulatory cells, and are involved in the peripheral tolerance. several studies have confirmed that pd- <dig> and its ligands  as well as ctla- <dig> and ligands  could drive the differentiation of cd4+foxp3+ t cells, down-regulate contact hypersensitivity reaction, reduce airway hyperreactivity, prevent eosinophil infiltration in the lungs, and prevent ige production  <cit> . piconi et al. also found that during allergen-specific immunotherapy, the expression of pd-l <dig> is increased compared with untreated control group  <cit> , which indirectly indicated that pd- <dig> played an important role in inducing immune tolerance. in our study, we found that the expression of pd- <dig> and ctla- <dig> on treg cells in blood, mediastinal draining lymph nodes, and spleen did not alter noticeably between control and ova groups, whereas ova323-339map intervention significantly increased the expression of two molecules on the surface of treg cells. it also indicated that ova323-339map induced immune tolerance through cell-cell contacting suppression is mediated by membrane-bound tgf-β <dig>  as well as pd- <dig> and ctla- <dig> 

as both cytokines and costimulatory molecules are key factors for treg cells activity, we investigated the suppressive function of treg cells. the function detection also showed that the inhibitory effect of treg cell from the ova323-339map intervention mice on effector t cells  proliferation was superior to that of ova challenged mice. however, in clinical studies of pit, there is still controversy over the role of treg cells. after treatment with major t cell epitope of cat allergen fel d <dig>  the th <dig> immune response was inhibited in vivo, but the inhibitory function of cd4+cd25+ treg cells was not significantly enhanced  <cit> . in another study on fel d <dig>  after peptide treatment, a group of cd4+ t cells with a regulatory effect significantly increased and could inhibit cd4- t cells function  <cit> . in addition, wegman et al. <cit>  found that maps treatment did not have a clear effect on cd4+foxp3+ cells in the mouse spleen and central nervous system. however, our research showed that ova323-339map intervention could not only increase the quantity of treg cells, but also enhance their function, accompanied by inversing th1/th <dig> balance, regulating humoral immunity, and alleviating mouse airway inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that ova323-339map, being different from ova323- <dig> peptide, could inhibit the th <dig> immune response and alleviate allergic airway inflammation in mice model and this function may be mediated by treg cells through direct and indirect mechanisms.
