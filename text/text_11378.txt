BACKGROUND
androgens have been shown to reverse muscle loss due to age  <cit> , and to preserve muscle in persons with hiv infection  <cit>  and burns  <cit> . in animal models, androgens also prevent or reduce atrophy due to disuse from spinal cord injury  <cit> , immobilization  <cit> , or unweighting  <cit> . the molecular basis for these beneficial effects remains poorly understood.

one major factor that contributes to muscle atrophy is accelerated catabolism of muscle proteins, which is largely attributable to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit>  and which has been linked to the muscle ubiquitin e <dig> ligases muscle atrophy f-box  and muscle ring-finger  <dig>   <cit> . upregulation of mafbx and murf <dig> has been attributed to activation of foxo <dig>  <cit> . degradation by mafbx of the muscle differentiation factor myod  <cit>  or the translation initiation factor eif3f  <cit>  have also been linked to muscle atrophy. in cardiac myocytes, mafbx also reduces calcium-dependent signaling through calcineurin and has been shown to reduce myocyte size  <cit> .

a role has been established in muscle atrophy for inhibitors of protein synthesis acting both up- and downstream of mtor, a protein kinase that integrates signals regulating protein synthesis and cell size and has also been implicated in muscle hypertrophy  <cit> . reductions in mtor activity caused by dexamethasone or ethanol have been shown to be due to upregulation of redd <dig>   <cit> . mtor is also inhibited by redd <dig> , a protein closely related to redd <dig>  <cit> . expression of redd <dig> is upregulated by foxo <dig>  <cit> , as is that of 4ebp <dig>  <cit> , which inhibits translation by reducing the initiation of cap-dependent translation by eif4e  <cit> .

we have recently found that administration for  <dig> days of the anabolic steroid nandrolone reduced denervation atrophy when begun  <dig> days after nerve transection  associated with reduced levels of mrna for mafbx and murf <dig>  but without changes in expression of igf- <dig>  its receptor, or igf- <dig> binding proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> . however, when begun at the time of denervation, administration of nandrolone for the same  <dig> day period  did not prevent atrophy or reduce expression of mafbx or murf <dig>  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms by which nandrolone slows atrophy at  <dig> days are unclear. while mafbx and murf <dig> accelerate denervation atrophy in mice  <cit>  and degrade several proteins that determine muscle mass  <cit> , their levels do not necessarily correlate to the response to interventions that spare muscle  <cit> . thus, there are likely to be additional actions of nandrolone that contribute to its protective effects on denervated muscle at  <dig> days. in addition, the molecular determinants that prevent the anabolic actions of nandrolone at  <dig> days are unknown.

we reasoned that comparison of genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> and  <dig> days would permit identification of those genes regulated only at  <dig> days, and which are thus likely to be associated with protection against atrophy. additionally, we predicted that the changes in gene expression in denervated muscle between  <dig> and  <dig> days formed the basis for the increased responsiveness to nandrolone at  <dig> days; because many actions of nandrolone involve its binding to the androgen receptor , a transcription factor that is activated when drug or hormone are bound, we predicted that there were changes over this period in the expression of genes encoding factors that either promoted or prevented transcriptional activity of the ar at target genes. here, we have tested these possibilities using oligonucleotide microarrays with verification of the expression of selected genes by real time pcr  and western blotting.

RESULTS
filtering of microarray data
probesets representing  <dig> known genes  were altered by nandrolone in denervated gastrocnemius at  <dig> days after nerve transection . at  <dig> days, nandrolone changed the expression of  <dig> genes  in denervated gastrocnemius muscle.

before comparing pools a and d, we examined the possible confounding effects of changes in gene expression over time due to the effects of denervation on skeletal muscle. a comparison of gene expression in denervated gastrocnemius muscle from animals administered vehicle revealed  <dig> unique genes that were altered at day  <dig> as compared to day  <dig> . among these,  <dig> were also present in pool d and were altered in the same direction by time  and nandrolone. these genes were removed from pool d, resulting in a new pool b with  <dig> genes . surprisingly, only  <dig> genes in pool a were also present in pool b . thus, the majority of genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days were not altered by this agent at  <dig> days.

go categories of genes altered by nandrolone
genes regulated by nandrolone were grouped according to their designations in the gene ontology database  to delineate common groupings and biological networks activated or suppressed in denervated muscle by nandrolone at  <dig> or  <dig> days. the biological functions of genes regulated by nandrolone at both time points are depicted in figure  <dig>  this analysis revealed marked differences in the biological functions of genes regulated by nandrolone at both of the time points. at  <dig> days, the most significant groupings were for cell cycle, cell death, cellular development and cancer, whereas at  <dig> days, the most significant p values were for lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry, categories that were not significantly enriched at  <dig> days . cell-cell signaling, and cardiovascular system development and function were also enriched only at  <dig> days, whereas categories for gene expression, and skeletal and muscular system development, were enriched only at  <dig> days. cell cycle, connective tissue development and function, skeletal and muscle disorders and cancer were enriched at both  <dig> and  <dig> days. thus, functional groupings of genes regulated by nandrolone differed at  <dig> and  <dig> days.

genes altered by nandrolone at  <dig> or  <dig> days
genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days were further filtered based upon known, or potential, roles in muscle atrophy or hypertrophy, or in transcriptional regulation by the ar; the genes selected are shown in table  <dig>  for the purposes of comparison, the effects of nandrolone on these genes at  <dig> days are also shown. a similar selection process was used to identify genes of potential interest that were regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days , which, again are shown together with corresponding effects of nandrolone at  <dig> days. a heat map depicting normalized expression values for each individual microarray for selected genes that were significantly altered by nandrolone at  <dig> days is shown in figure  <dig>  comparison of expression changes in table  <dig> with corresponding changes for each microarray  revealed good agreement. overall, the direction and relative magnitude of change was similar among the microarrays for each of the genes examined.

calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling
several genes encoding molecules involved in calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling were differentially altered at  <dig> days as compared to  <dig> days. regulator of calcineurin  <dig>  was significantly downregulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days but was upregulated at  <dig> days . thrombospondin  <dig>  was upregulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days but down-regulated at  <dig> days . calcineurin b, type <dig>  was up regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days but unchanged at  <dig> days .

growth factors and response to wounding
nandrolone altered the expression of several growth factors. at  <dig> days, nandrolone markedly upregulated apolipoprotein-d  and galanin . at  <dig> days, nandrolone also upregulated osteoglycin, chemokine  ligand  <dig> and chemokine  receptor  <dig>  and the wnt inhibitors secreted frizzled-related peptides  <dig> and  <dig> . expression of these genes was not affected by nandrolone at  <dig> days, with the exception of galanin . at  <dig> days, nandrolone upregulated osteomodulin, adiponectin-c1q and collagen domain containing, and sema3b . at  <dig> days, nandrolone downregulated sclerostin domain containing  <dig> , a bmp- <dig> antagonist  <cit> .

protein kinases and their regulators
genes encoding or regulating protein kinases were also differentially regulated by nandrolone at both  <dig> and  <dig> days. at  <dig> days, nandrolone upregulated the following: protein kinase inhibitor alpha ; the a <dig> catalytic subunit of amp-activated protein kinase ; and sprouty protein with evh- <dig> domain  <dig> related sequence  . at  <dig> days, nandrolone downregulated the gamma  <dig> non-catalytic subunit of amp-activated protein kinase , and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii, alpha  . at  <dig> days, nandrolone upregulated spred <dig>  although to a lesser extent than at  <dig> days, but did not alter expression of pkiα, prkag <dig>  or camk2a . at  <dig> days, nandrolone downregulated tribbles homolog  <dig>  a modulator of mapk pathways .

transcription/rna processing
at  <dig> days, nandrolone upregulated selected transcription factors by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold, including early response genes , the human immunodeficiency virus type i enhancer binding protein  <dig> , and nupr <dig>  a tumor suppressor that regulates transcription and has been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy  <cit>  . nandrolone also upregulated atf <dig> at  <dig> days . at  <dig> days, nandrolone repressed forkhead box protein o1a, more commonly referred to as foxo <dig>  the designation used hereafter. also repressed by nandrolone at  <dig> days were transforming, acidic coiled-coil containing protein  <dig> , and heat shock transcription factor  <dig>  . genes for three transcriptional coregulators were repressed by nandrolone at  <dig> days: grainyhead like , at hook, and carboxyterminal domain rna polymerase ii small phosphatase  .

a striking aspect of the genes altered at  <dig> days was that the  <dig> genes most greatly downregulated by nandrolone were transcription factors  . these included the early response factors egr1- <dig> , as well as ier <dig> and ier <dig> , some of which were upregulated by nandrolone at  <dig> days  . at  <dig> days, nandrolone repressed three orphan nuclear receptors   and several transcriptional coregulators: ankrd <dig>  one of a family of molecules that transmits signals from the contractile apparatus to the nucleus  <cit>  , and tle1_predicted, a transcriptional corepressor . also repressed were btg <dig>  an antiproliferative factor which regulates transcription in a p53-dependent manner, and bcl6_predicted, a transcriptional repressor involved in morphogenesis .

at  <dig> days, nandrolone altered expression of genes involved in rna processing. notable among these was dicer  <dig>  as noted above . at  <dig> days, nandrolone reduced expression of deah  box polypeptide  <dig>  an rna helicase .

other pathways

validation of cdna microarray results with qpcr
to confirm selected microarray results, and to examine biological variability among equivalently treated animals, we examined mrna levels in denervated gastrocnemius muscles using real time pcr. in this analysis, we also included foxo3a, which is closely related to foxo <dig> and exerts similar effects on the expression of mafbx  <cit> . there was good agreement between the microarray and qpcr data as far as direction and relative magnitude of changes in gene expression. at  <dig> days, nandrolone significantly increased expression of apod and clu and decreased expression of redd <dig>  rcan <dig>  foxo <dig>  dicer  <dig>  camk2a, csnk1a <dig> and hsf <dig> . at  <dig> days, effects of nandrolone on gene expression were: in the opposite direction for foxo <dig>  foxo3a and camk2a; smaller for redd <dig>  clu and, apod; and minimal for rcan <dig>  csnk1a <dig> and hsf <dig> .

western blotting
effects of nandrolone on levels of selected proteins in denervated gastrocnemius muscle were assessed by western blotting. these effects agreed well with changes in mrna levels . nandrolone significantly reduced levels of rcan <dig>  foxo <dig> and redd <dig> at  <dig> but not  <dig> days, and significantly increased apod levels at  <dig> days but not  <dig> days .

changes over time in gene expression in denervated muscle
microarray data
gene expression in denervated muscle from vehicle-treated rats was compared at  <dig> and  <dig> days. a complete listing of the genes for which expression was found to change significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> days is shown in additional file  <dig>  this list included  <dig> unique genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, connective tissue development and function, cell cycle, and cell death.

genes demonstrating altered expression included those expressing kinases, phosphatases and transcriptional regulators but not growth factors. when comparing expression levels at  <dig> versus  <dig> days for transcriptional coregulators, crebbp, rnpc <dig>  prrx <dig>  nrip <dig> and nmi were upregulated by 2- to  <dig> -fold while tgif, lmcd <dig>  ankrd <dig> and ankrd <dig> were downregulated from - <dig> -to - <dig> -fold . there were  <dig> other transcriptional regulators for which expression changed between  <dig> and  <dig> days, with alterations in expression ranging from a  <dig> -fold increase to - <dig> -fold decrease . the largest increases in expression were for tsc22d <dig>  bhlhb <dig>  and dbp, while the greatest decreases in expression were observed for btg <dig>  egr <dig>  and rcan <dig> .

seventeen kinases demonstrated significant changes in expression ranging from a  <dig> -fold increase to a - <dig> -fold decrease. kinases with the most highly increased expression included erbb <dig>  ntrk <dig>  and pik3c2b, while those with the greatest decrease in expression included mpp <dig>  trib <dig>  and uck <dig> . seven phosphatases demonstrated altered expression, with  <dig> being decreased by - <dig> - to - <dig> -fold and one being increased by  <dig> -fold  .

verification of selected microarray data by real time pcr
the results of the microarray analysis were confirmed for selected genes by real time pcr . a comparison of findings from microarray and real time pcr analysis revealed that the direction and magnitude of change in expression were similar. as compared to  <dig> days, expression at  <dig> days was significantly different for the transcriptional coregulators ankrd <dig>  ankrd <dig>  and crebbp, as well as for the transcription factors atf <dig> and limcd  <dig> 

correlation between gene expression changes and nandrolone response
to gain insights into physiological significance of gene expression changes, we analyzed the relationship between gastrocnemius muscle size at  <dig> days and magnitude of gene expression change induced by nandrolone. for this analysis we chose the two genes for which nandrolone had the largest effect on mrna levels as determined by real time pcr: rcan <dig> and apod. there was a significant negative correlation between rcan <dig> mrna levels and gastrocnemius muscle weight . a positive correlation was observed between apod mrna and weights of denervated gastrocnemius .

discussion
nandrolone effects on gene expression over time
this study sought insights into the molecular basis for the observation that administration of nandrolone for  <dig> days slowed denervation atrophy when begun at day  <dig> after nerve transection , but had no effect on atrophy when initiated at the time the nerve was severed . the findings indicated that nandrolone regulated an almost entirely different set of genes at  <dig> days compared to  <dig> days. a marked change in the expression in denervated muscle of genes involved in the control of transcription and intracellular signaling was observed between  <dig> and  <dig> days.

among genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> but not  <dig> days were molecules that drive muscle atrophy , inhibit protein synthesis , regulate calcineurin , and determine wnt signaling . foxo <dig> is a transcription factor known to reduce muscle size  <cit> , and to upregulate mafbx and murf <dig> and the protein synthesis inhibitor 4ebp <dig>  <cit> . nandrolone-induced reductions in foxo <dig> at  <dig> but not  <dig> days agree well with the prior observation that nandrolone reduced expression of mafbx and murf <dig> at  <dig> but not  <dig> days  <cit> . the findings suggest that downregulation of foxo <dig> represents a likely mechanism by which nandrolone slows denervation atrophy.

to our knowledge, neither rcan <dig> nor calcineurin have been previously suggested to be involved in nandrolone action or denervation atrophy. calcineurin is a calcium-calmodulin-dependent dual-specificity phosphatase which promotes the slow-twitch endurance muscle fiber type  <cit> . at  <dig> days, nandrolone reduced expression of rcan <dig>  and rcan <dig> levels were inversely correlated with the size of denervated gastrocnemius. nandrolone also altered the expression of a regulatory subunit of calcineurin, calcineurin b, type  <dig>  of interest, in studies of calcineurin function in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, calcineurin activity has been shown to be reduced by mafbx, foxo <dig> or foxo3a, and to be directly linked to myocardiocyte size  <cit> . the role of calcineurin in hypertrophy of normal skeletal muscle hypertrophy, or spontaneous recovery from muscle atrophy, is controversial  <cit> . its roles in denervated muscle, or androgen action, are unknown. we are now investigating the relationship between nandrolone action and calcineurin in atrophied skeletal muscle.

increased expression of inhibitors of mtor, such as redd <dig> and redd <dig>  have been linked to decreases in cell size and protein synthesis and have been suggested to promote muscle atrophy  <cit> . mtor is a master regulator of protein synthesis  <cit>  and is necessary for muscle hypertrophy and recovery of muscle size after muscle atrophy  <cit> . upregulation of mtor inhibitors has been described during muscle atrophy caused by glucocorticoids  <cit>  or alcohol ingestion  <cit>  and has been implicated in mtor inhibition due to glucocorticoids in cultured myoblasts  <cit> . of interest, testosterone prevented upregulation of redd <dig> in dexamethasone-treated rats and cultured myoblasts and normalized mtor activity in cultured cells exposed to dexamethasone  <cit> . consistent with these findings, in denervated muscle, nandrolone reduced redd <dig> mrna and protein at  <dig> but not  <dig> days, suggesting that reduction in expression of this protein, and subsequent increases in mtor activity, may represent one mechanism by which nandrolone slows denervation atrophy.

other genes upregulated at  <dig> days by nandrolone include wnt signaling molecules  and apod. wnt signaling appears to be important to muscle hypertrophy  <cit> . of interest, in a cell culture system, the intracellular target of wnt signaling, β-catenin, can be activated by androgens through physical interactions between β-catenin and the ar  <cit> . upregulation of apod, a lipoprotein believed to participate in uptake or intercellular transport of ligands  <cit> , correlated well with denervated muscle size at  <dig> days. upregulation of this gene has also been observed in muscle hypertrophy  <cit> . the significance of these changes in apod expression is unknown.

molecular determinants of nandrolone-induced alterations in gene expression
an additional objective of this study was to examine the possibility that changes over time in gene expression could provide insights into the molecular determinants for the marked time-dependent effects of nandrolone on gene expression in denervated muscle. these time-dependent effects were dramatically demonstrated by the minimal overlap of genes regulated at  <dig> versus  <dig> days, despite the fact that over  <dig> genes were regulated by this agent at each time point. equally interesting was the finding that the list of genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> but not  <dig> days included several shown to be critical to muscle atrophy, specifically foxo <dig> , and mafbx and murf <dig>  <cit> .

these time-dependent actions of nandrolone occurred on a background of changes over time in expression of over  <dig> genes in denervated muscle, that included many genes that function in intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation, such as kinases, phosphatases, transcription factors and transcriptional coregulators. the ar is a transcription factor, and the classical mechanism by which drugs such as nandrolone signal through the ar is transcriptional regulation by the ar when bound to chromatin, or to other transcription factors. transcriptional activity of the ar is dependent upon binding of coregulators  <cit> , and interactions with nearby transcription factors. coregulators modify chromatin structure to repress or transactivate specific genes, and their binding to ar is critical to its transcriptional control of target genes  <cit> .

interactions between the ar and other transcription factors form one basis for transcriptional repression  and can determine whether a steroid hormone receptor, such as the ar, is able to transactivate specific genes  <cit> . interdependence of ar actions and levels of specific transcription factors were illustrated by findings that gene knockdown with and sirna against oct- <dig> abrogated repression of mafbx by testosterone  <cit> . the concept that levels of a transcriptional regulator can profoundly affect transcriptional programs was demonstrated by the effects of pgc-1α on muscle fiber type and mitochondrial biogenesis . thus, one model that would explain the time-dependent effect of nandrolone is variation over time in levels or activity of transcription factors and/or coregulators with which the ar interacts at target genes.

marked changes in the expression of several transcriptional coregulators were observed between days  <dig> and  <dig> after denervation, with the most dramatic being the large reductions in expression levels for ankrd <dig> and ankrd <dig>  the influence of these coregulators on transcriptional regulation by the ar has not been described. among coregulators with less dramatic changes in expression between  <dig> and  <dig> days, several are known to regulate transcriptional activities of the ar: crebbp  <cit> , tgif  <cit> , ctdsp <dig> <cit>  and nrip <dig>  <cit> .

interactions between the ar and other transcription factors have been reported for gr, ets <dig>  oct <dig>  nfkb, foxo <dig> and ap <dig>  <cit> . many transcription factors demonstrated altered expression between  <dig> and  <dig> days. although interactions of these transcription factors with the ar have not been reported, it remains possible that these occur, and that changes in their expression may be linked to some of the time dependent effects of nandrolone.

other mechanisms may also be involved in, or be critical to, time-dependent effects of nandrolone on gene expression. these may include changes in phosphorylation status of transcriptional regulators, or non-genomic effects of nandrolone mediated through interactions with kinases , g-proteins, or other intracellular signaling molecules  <cit> . for example, it has been demonstrated that transcriptional activity of pgc-1α is determined by activity of the kinases ampk and p <dig> mapk  <cit> .

thus, the findings suggest several possible mechanisms that may explain the time-dependent effects of nandrolone on gene expression in denervated muscle. future investigations focused on more detailed time course studies, interactions of proteins encoded by these regulatory genes with the ar, and their effects on nandrolone target genes such as foxo <dig> or mafbx, hold the promise of identifying the specific molecular interactions by which nandrolone exerts such profoundly different actions over time.

comparison with other studies of androgen actions in atrophied muscle
an interesting consideration is that the effects of nandrolone to slow atrophy of denervated gastrocnemius are much greater than its effects to increase the mass of normal rat muscles, including gastrocnemius,  <cit>  but that both of these actions of nandrolone are considerably smaller than the dramatic effect of androgens to increase the size of the rat levator ani muscle  <cit> . it is possible that similar mechanisms determine androgen responsiveness of these normal and denervated muscles. it is also possible that the marked changes in expression of key regulatory molecules that occurs with time after denervation play important roles in determining androgen sensitivity of denervated muscle that are distinct from those that specify the androgen responses of normal muscle and the levator ani.

in either case, the time-dependent differences in nandrolone effects on denervated muscle appear to be one manifestation of a more general influence of the physiological state of skeletal muscle on responses to androgens. for example, genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> or  <dig> days differed from those regulated by androgens in other genomic studies. in agreement with our findings in denervated muscle at  <dig> days, in hiv-infected men, testosterone altered the expression of genes regulating igf- <dig> signaling, muscle development, transcription, cell cycle and apoptosis, and wnt signaling, but in contrast to denervated muscle, not those involved in calcineurin signaling or translation  <cit> . in dexamethasone-treated rats, testosterone reversed dexamethasone-induced changes in expression of foxo <dig>  but also reduced expression of redd <dig> and 4ebp <dig>  <cit> , genes that were not found to be nandrolone responsive in denervated muscle. in ar-deficient mice, alterations in gene expression were noted for genes for myoblast differentiation and polyamine synthesis, as well as those for cell cycle progression and wnt signaling  <cit> . loss of the ar also affected expression of igf-ii and several other growth factors, but, not genes regulating calcineurin signaling or translation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
genes regulated by nandrolone in denervated muscle at  <dig> days were almost entirely different from those regulated by this agent to  <dig> days. these time-dependent nandrolone effects were associated with many changes in expression in denervated muscle of genes involved in the control of transcription and intracellular signaling. genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> but not  <dig> days include factors known to drive muscle atrophy , inhibit protein synthesis , regulate calcineurin , and determine wnt signaling. marked changes in expression of transcriptional regulators known or suspected to interact with the ar occur between  <dig> and  <dig> days, and their differential regulation may explain the time-dependence of nandrolone effects on gene expression in denervated muscle, at least in part.
