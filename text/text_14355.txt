BACKGROUND
the ubiquitous non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig>  plays a key role in ras/erk signaling downstream of most, if not all growth factors, cytokines and integrins, although its major substrates remain controversial  <cit> . shp <dig> contains two n-terminal sh <dig> domains, a catalytic  domain, a c-terminal tail with two tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a proline-rich domain  <cit> , and is regulated by an elegant molecular switch mechanism that couples appropriate cellular localization to catalytic activation  <cit> . in the absence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated binding partner for its sh <dig> domains , shp <dig> assumes a “closed” conformation wherein the n-terminal sh <dig>  domain is wedged into the ptp domain, blocking substrate access . upon agonist stimulation, recruitment of the n-sh <dig> domain to specific phosphotyrosyl  peptides disrupts this self-locking conformation, freeing the ptp domain for catalysis  <cit> .

mutations in ptpn <dig> cause several human diseases. germ-line ptpn <dig> mutations cause ~50% of noonan syndrome , which is among the most common autosomal dominant disorders  <cit> . gain-of-function mutations in other ras-raf-mek-erk pathway members, including sos <dig> <cit> , kras <cit> , nras <cit> , shoc <dig> <cit> , and raf <dig> <cit> , are responsible for most remaining ns cases. with an estimated incidence of 1/ <dig>  live births  <cit> , ns is characterized by facial dysmorphism, proportional short stature, cardiac anomalies, and various less penetrant phenotypes, such as webbed neck, deafness, and motor delay. many  ns patients develop some type of myeloproliferative disorder , which is typically mild and self-limited  <cit> . rare ns patients progress to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia , which is fatal if not treated by bone marrow transplantation, somatic ptpn <dig> mutations are the single most common cause of sporadic jmml  <cit> . leopard syndrome , a much less common autosomal dominant disorder, is almost always caused by ptpn <dig> mutations, and is related to, but distinguishable from, ns  <cit> . leopard is an acronym for its major syndromic manifestations: multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormalities of genitalia, retardation of growth, and deafness  <cit> . these patients often have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , and might also have an increased risk of neuroblastoma  and acute myeloid leukemia   <cit> . knock-in mouse models have been generated for ns and ls alleles of ptpn <dig> and generally reproduce the phenotypes seen in the cognate human syndromes  <cit> .

consistent with the distinct pathogenesis of ns and ls, different types of ptpn <dig> mutations cause these disorders. most ns-associated ptpn <dig> mutations alter residues that reside at the interface between the n-sh <dig> and ptp domains  <cit> , resulting in elevated enzymatic activity and enhanced ras/erk activation  <cit> . these data suggest that ns mutations disrupt the intramolecular interaction between the n-sh <dig> and ptp domains, shifting the equilibrium between the closed and open conformations and lowering the activation threshold for shp <dig>  by contrast, ls mutations typically affect ptp domain residues, result in markedly decreased catalytic activity, and lower ras/erk activation in transient transfection assays  <cit> . studies of the ls y279c mouse model also indicate that ls mutants may have dominant negative effects in at least some tissues in vivo <cit> . whereas ns phenotypes arise from enhanced mek/erk activation and can be prevented or reversed by mek inhibition  <cit> , ls-associated hcm is caused by enhanced pi3k/akt/mtorc <dig> activity and can be reversed by rapamycin  <cit> .

although multiple studies have reported the biochemical and biological consequences of ns- and ls-associated ptpn <dig> mutations, their structural consequences have not been analyzed. here, we report the x-ray structures of five ns/ls shp <dig> mutants and discuss how these mutations affect the interaction between different shp <dig> domains and its catalytic activity.

methods
cloning
a wild type  shp <dig> expression construct 1– <dig>  was pcr-amplified from ptpn <dig> cdna  <cit>  with a set of custom-designed primers . the resultant pcr fragment was cloned into a modified version of the plasmid pet28b  that generates a fusion protein with an n-terminal hexahistidine tag. the shp <dig> catalytic domain expression construct  was cloned into pgex4t, which introduces a gst-tag at its n-terminus. mutations were introduced into these expression constructs by site directed-mutagenesis with specifically designed primers bearing one substitution each . pfu ultra ii high fidelity dna polymerase  was used for pcr, with an extension temperature of 68°c over 10 minutes. to remove any traces of the original cdna, all reactions were subjected to digestion with dpni  for 1 hour at 37°c. reaction mixtures were transformed into dh5α cells, and the genetic content of all constructs was verified by sanger sequencing.

protein expression & purification
vectors encoding full length versions of shp <dig> mutants were transferred into e. coli bl <dig>  cells were grown in terrific broth containing kanamycin  in 1 l tunair flasks at 37°c to an od <dig> of 3– <dig>  after which the temperature was lowered to 16°c, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside  was added to  <dig>  mm. expression was allowed to proceed overnight, then cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°c. due to the low level of expression of the q506p construct, cells expressing this mutant were washed using the osmotic shock technique  <cit>  prior to freezing. unless stated otherwise, all purification procedures were carried out at 4°c. cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in binding buffer , supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and benzamidine. after disruption by sonication and centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 40 min, cell-free extracts were passed through a de- <dig> column  that had been pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, and loaded by gravity flow onto a ni-nitrilotriacetic acid  column . the latter column was washed with 20– <dig> volumes of wash buffer a, followed by 20– <dig> volumes of wash buffer b and finally with elution buffer. n308d and e139d eluted in elution buffer, whereas the other three mutants eluted with the wash buffers. for the latter proteins, the wash fractions were diluted 15-fold and reloaded on fresh ni-nta columns. after washing with  <dig> column volumes of binding buffer, n308d and e139d proteins were eluted in elution buffer. these samples were concentrated using a vivaspin unit , and loaded onto a  <dig>  × 60 cm superdex  <dig> column , equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. elution was performed at a flow rate of 3 ml/min at 8°c, with the shp <dig> proteins behaving as apparent monomers. final protein samples were concentrated to 20–40 mg/ml, divided into  <dig>  mg aliquots, flash-frozen and stored at −80°c.

shp <dig> catalytic domain mutants were transformed into escherichia coli strain bl <dig>  a 25 ml aliquot of an overnight culture from a single colony was added to 500 ml of lb/ampicillin  and grown at 37°c to a600 =  <dig> . iptg was added to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm, and the bacteria were maintained for 16 h at 25°c with shaking, then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 10 min. at 4°c. pellets were resuspended in  <dig>  ml of a buffer containing 50 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> , 150 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl <dig>  1% triton x- <dig>  10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin a,  <dig>  mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mg/ml dnase i. suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 minutes, and then sonicated for 10 seconds on ice. lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 30 min. at 4°c, and supernatants were transferred to a fresh 15-ml polypropylene tube containing  <dig>  ml of glutathione-sepharose 4b . this suspension was rotated end-over-end overnight at 4°c, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min. at 4°c. the supernatants were discarded, and the beads were washed  <dig> times for 5 min. each at 4°c with 10 ml of wash buffer , and then once with ptp assay buffer . bound gst fusion proteins were resuspended 1: <dig> in ptp assay buffer. a  <dig> ul aliquot of slurry for each mutant was separated on a 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel, together with different amounts of bsa. the gel was washed in water for 10 minutes, and stained with colloidal coomassie blue for 1 hour at room temperature. bands were quantified using a li-cor odyssey.

ptp assays
to determine kinetic parameters, fixed amounts of purified gst-wt or -mutant shp <dig> catalytic domains  were incubated with variable concentrations of substrate peptide  in ptp assay buffer in a total volume of  <dig> ul. reactions were carried out for 10 minutes at 25°c, and phosphate release was quantified by adding malachite green  to the supernatants, measuring absorbance at 620 nm, and comparing values to a standard curve generated with varying amounts of kh2po <dig>  all reactions fell within the linear range. phosphatase activity is expressed in pmol pi released/min/pmol enzyme.

crystallization
mutant shp <dig> proteins were crystallized under conditions similar to those reported previously  <cit> . in order to obtain the best diffracting crystals,  <dig>  m licl was added to the literature crystallization conditions for d61g, 5% glycerol for n308d, and 10% glycerol and  <dig>  m cycohexyl-methyl-β-d-maltoside for q506p. the other two mutant proteins and the wt protein were crystallized under literature conditions with optimized precipitant concentrations. crystals appeared overnight, and reached their full size of about  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> microns in one week at room temperature. the stacked plate crystals were separated and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, using paratone-n oil  as a cryo-protectant.

data collection
data were collected at 100 k with a wavelength of  <dig>  Å on the industrial macromolecular crystallography association  beam line at the advanced photon source . the data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with xds and xscale <cit> .

structure determination
the first mutant structure of n308d was determined by molecular replacement, using the previously solved structure of shp <dig>   <cit>  as the search model. the wild type shp <dig> and d61g, e139d, y279c and q506p mutant structures were determined by molecular replacement, using the structure of the n308d shp <dig> mutant as a search model. following the initial rigid body refinement, interactive cycles of model building and refinement were performed by using coot <cit>  and buster-tnt <cit>  software. special attention was paid to the mutation sites, which were initially replaced with alanine to reduce model bias and later positioned based on the 2mfo-dfc and difference fourier electron density maps after a few rounds of refinement to confirm that those amino acids had, indeed, been mutated. data collection and refinement statistics are shown in table  <dig>  the atomic coordinates have been deposited in the rcsb protein data bank under accession numbers 4nxd, 4h <dig>  4nwg, 4gwf, 4nwf, and 4h <dig>  all figures were produced using pymol .

rmerge = ∑ hkl|i − 〈i〉|/∑hkli, where i is the intensity of the individual reflections.

rwork = ∑ |fobs − fcal|/∑|fobs, where fobs and fcalc are the observed and the calculated structure factors, respectively.

rfree was calculated using 5% of total reflections randomly chosen and excluded from the crystallographic refinement.

RESULTS
we determined the crystal structures of wt shp <dig> , as well as five mutants , chosen to represent the spectrum of disease-associated ptpn <dig> mutations. mutants d61g, e139d, and n308d are found in ns, y279c is a canonical ls mutation  <cit> , and q506p has been reported in both disorders  <cit> , although it is unclear whether this reflects misdiagnosis or true bi-potentiality of this allele. the d61g mutation affects the n-sh <dig> domain, e139d lies within the c-sh <dig> domain and the other three mutations alter the ptp domain . the enzymatic properties of the full-length versions of these mutants  were characterized previously by our group  <cit>  , and range from strongly activated , to mildly activated , to catalytically impaired . q506p shows altered specificity for some substrates  <cit> .

the shp <dig> structure published by hof et al.  has three mutations  and is in complex with a detergent molecule . we corrected these mutations, and crystallized wt shp <dig> under detergent-free conditions. in our wt structure, the sh <dig> domains and the ptp domain assume a “closed” conformation with the n-sh <dig> domain locked into the ptp catalytic site, similar to the 2shp structure . superimposition of our bona fide wt structure with the earlier “wt” shp <dig> structure revealed an overall root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> aligned residues. the n-sh <dig> domain had a smaller rmsd of  <dig>  Å, whereas the rmsd for the c-sh <dig> was larger , implying that the c-sh <dig> domain might have a higher degree of flexibility than the other two domains in the closed conformation. the three mutations and the ctab binding site in the 2shp structure are distant from the c-sh <dig> domain, so we do not think it likely that they affect c-sh <dig> domain flexibility directly. in the ptp domain, the major deviations between the two structures were seen in residues 425– <dig> of the αf helix , corresponding to the ctab binding site in the 2shp structure . although the overall structural difference between wt and 2shp was small, we used our wt structure as the reference for comparison with the mutant structures to exclude any potential structural changes induced by the three mutations and the detergent molecule  in 2shp.

d61g
in the wt structure, asp <dig> was located on the surface of the n-sh <dig> domain. the side chain of asp <dig> formed hydrogen bonds with ser <dig> from the catalytic p-loop , a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the catalytic cysteinyl residue, cys <dig>  two water-mediated hydrogen bonds with arg <dig>  and another water-mediated hydrogen bond with asp <dig> . consequently, asp <dig> plays an important role in the n-sh <dig> and ptp domain interaction. in the d61g mutant structure, these hydrogen bonds were abolished. the change from aspartate to glycine also altered the surface charge from very negative to neutral . opposite d61g on the interface surface, the ptp domain presents a predominantly positively charged pocket . thus, the d61g mutation greatly loosened the interactions between n-sh <dig> and ptp domains. these data are consistent with previous publications that observed increased basal activity for this mutant against artificial  and ptyr-peptide substrates  <cit> .

e139d
residue glu <dig> was located on the surface of the c-sh <dig> domain. the overall crystal structure of the e139d mutant was very similar to that of wt shp <dig>  with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å . glu <dig> was about 40 Å away from the catalytic site, with the n-sh <dig> domain interposed between these domains. e <dig> is, however, located in the vicinity of the phosphate group of the ptyr peptide-binding site of the c-sh <dig> domain, and the e139d mutation stabilizes the conformation of the 139– <dig> loop that plays an essential role in ptyr peptide-binding. the mutant structure has well defined electron density for this loop, whereas this loop is disordered in the wt structure. compared with wt shp <dig>  there also were some local structural rearrangements in the e139d mutant, with the most noticeable difference being a conformational change of his <dig> . the e139d mutant shows a small increase in basal activity, but when it is assayed with a ptyr peptide  that can bind both sh <dig> domains and be dephosphorylated by the catalytic domain, the activity of this mutant is more than  <dig> times higher than that of wt shp <dig>  <cit> . although the side chain charge remained unchanged when glutamic acid was changed to aspartic acid, the size of the side chain was reduced. this change could alter the surface of the adjacent residue, arg <dig>  a key residue for ptyr binding  <cit> . as shown in figure 4b, aspartic acid  <dig>  contributes less hydrogen bonding to residues his114-his <dig> of the βa strand than does glutamic acid. this subtle change might loosen the connection between the βa and βb strands, helping to expose the side chain of arg <dig>  and thus enhancing the affinity for ptyr-peptide binding. the binding of ptyr -peptides to the c-sh <dig> domain also could affect the interaction between the n-sh <dig> and c-sh <dig> that is critical for enzymatic activation  <cit> . the mutant also could facilitate the binding of the c-sh <dig> domain to certain physiologically important binding partners; e.g., irs- <dig>  in which ptyr- <dig> binds to the c-sh <dig> domain, while ptyr- <dig> binds to the n-sh <dig> domain. the e139d mutation could indirectly increase the binding affinity of the n-sh <dig> domain for shp <dig> substrates , and therefore increase catalytic activity. in concert, these effects likely explain why e139d is activated by ptyr-peptide binding more than wt shp <dig> 

y279c
y279c is a catalytically impaired mutant associated with ls  <cit> . in the crystal structure of this mutant, tyr <dig> was located in the long ptyr loop  with two small α-helices, αc  and αd , at its upstream end and one small β-strand, βb , at its downstream end. in general, because the intervening region  lacks a structurally stable long α-helix or β-strand, it is likely to be flexible. it also contained a large number of positively charged side chains pointing toward the surface of the ptp domain that might interact with solvent molecules or other binding partners and thus increase the mobility of the ptyr loop. in the wt structure, the side chain of tyr <dig> makes van der waals contacts with ser <dig> and ala <dig> of the catalytic p-loop, as well as with tyr <dig> and lys <dig> from the n-sh <dig> domain . the –oh group of tyr <dig> interacts with the π-electrons of the tyr279’s aromatic ring. together with q <dig> in the q-loop , tyr <dig> is believed to play a key role in binding the tyrosine side chains of substrate proteins/peptides during catalysis. in the ptp1b structure  <cit> , tyr <dig> is the residue equivalent to tyr <dig> in the shp <dig> structure  <cit> . the stacking interaction of three residues, tyr <dig>  the substrate ptyr, and phe <dig> from the “wpdf” loop, help to properly position the substrate for catalysis. in the y279c structure, the interactions of tyr <dig> with the p-loop and the n-sh <dig> domain were disrupted, due to the significantly shorter side chain of cysteine compared with that of tyrosine. shp <dig> has a wpdh loop that corresponds to wpdf in ptp1b. the y279c mutation would have less stacking interactions with tyr <dig>  a bound ptyr substrate, and his <dig> . the mutation also distorts the ptyr substrate/shp <dig> interaction, and thus would be expected to disrupt catalysis significantly. at the same time, the y279c mutation results in loss of the tyr279/tyr <dig> interaction, diminishing the strength of intramolecular binding between the ptp and n-sh <dig> domains. this would be expected to facilitate the “open” conformation, and can explain the enhanced interaction of this mutant with binding partners  observed previously  <cit> . while this manuscript was in preparation, yu et al.  <cit>  reported a very similar model of y279c , as well as wt shp <dig> . the cα carbon atom comparison for these structures revealed rmsd of  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å for the corresponding mutant and wild-type crystal structure pairs correspondingly. both published crystal structures belong to the p <dig> space group, which is different from the space group  for our y279c mutant and wt structures. importantly, the residues surrounding the mutant residue are in a similar conformation. our wt structure has two disordered regions  lacking electron density . from both y279c structures, we can see that replacing tyrosine with cysteine at position  <dig> does not block the accessibility to the ptp catalytic site; instead, it could facilitate local conformational changes that lead to the release of the n-sh <dig> domain, and thereby open the conformation of the substrate-binding site.

to test the predictions of these structural studies, we assayed the enzymatic activity of isolated shp <dig> catalytic domains . compared with wt gst-shp <dig>  the y279c mutant had ~ <dig> times lower kcat and  <dig> times higher km towards a py peptide . these results are quite similar to those were reported by yu et al. <cit> . yu et al. also provided hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments and molecular dynamics simulations showing that the n-sh <dig> and ptp domain interaction was decreased in the y279c mutant. moreover, they found that the y279c mutant displayed higher affinity for, and was preferentially activated by, a non-hydrolyzable n-sh <dig> ligand.

n308d
residue  <dig> was located in the βc strand of the ptp domain, and was not involved in direct interactions with the n-sh <dig> domain. however, the oδ <dig> atom from the side chain of asn <dig> formed a strong hydrogen bond with the side chain of the conserved arg <dig>  arg  <dig> also made direct hydrogen bonds with the main chains of the p-loop residues ala <dig> and gly <dig> . the nδ <dig> atom of asn <dig> formed two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of phe <dig> from the ptyr-loop. in the n308d mutant, the charge of the side chain changes from neutral to negative, whereas the side chain polarity changes from polar to acidic polar. compared with the wt asn residue, asp <dig> formed more hydrogen bonds with ptyr-loop residues, and an especially strong one  with thr <dig> . consequently, this mutation could make the ptyr- and p-loops less flexible, locking the enzyme in a more favorable position for catalysis. the greater rigidity of the ptyr and p loops makes it more difficult for the n-sh <dig> domain to close back on the ptp domain once it opens. since the open and closed forms are in equilibrium, this could mean that the ability  for closing back is significantly diminished, hence favoring the open form, leading to the increased activity  of the n308d mutant as a full-length enzyme. the residue asn <dig> is a hot spot for ns mutations, with n308d accounting for 25% of ns cases. previous studies showed that this mutant  has a 3-fold higher basal activity than wt  <cit> . our ptp assay showed that catalytic domain of this mutation had slightly higher kcat and km values when compared with the wt ptp domain .

q506p
residue  <dig> was located in the interface between the ptp and n-sh <dig> domains. in the wt structure, q <dig> formed two important hydrogen bonds, with the main chain of ala <dig> and with the side chain of asn <dig> in the n-sh <dig> domain. together with tyr <dig>  gln <dig> also plays an important role in ptp catalysis by binding the tyrosine side chain of the substrate  <cit>  and by helping to properly position a water molecule for hydrolysis of the thiophosphate intermediate . in the q506p mutant structure, the proline mutation abolished the two hydrogen bonds between the ptp and n-sh <dig> domain, which predicts that this mutant should be more “open” than wt shp <dig>  however, this mutation also disrupts the c459-h2o-q <dig> interaction. as a result, the water molecule needed in the second step of catalysis probably cannot be positioned properly. consistent with this notion, basal ptp activity and ptp activity in the presence of an n-sh <dig> domain binding ptyr peptide are slightly lower  than in wt shp <dig>  <cit> . we also monitored the activity of the isolated catalytic domain of the q506p mutant. in accord with our structural data, the kcat of q506p was ~15–fold lower and the km about 2× higher than in wt shp <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
shp <dig> is regulated by a molecular switch mechanism that controls its catalytic activity. upon binding to a tyrosine-phosphorylated binding partner for its sh <dig> domains, the n-terminal sh <dig> domain is released from the ptp domain, activating the enzyme. this elegant mechanism ensures that ptp activity is delivered to the right place in the cell at the right time. remarkably, germ line mutations that disrupt this regulatory machinery in different ways result in distinct disease syndromes. the crystal structures of “true” wt shp <dig> and five ns/ls-associated shp <dig> mutants reported herein provide direct comparisons of the local conformational changes caused by each mutation. our structural observations are in agreement with, and can provide mechanistic insight into, the previously reported catalytic properties of these mutants. for example, mutation of d61g in the n-sh <dig> domain significantly impacts shp <dig> activity because this residue is located at the n-sh2/ptp domain interface and its alteration weakens key interactions between the two domains. on the other hand, our data suggest that the c-sh <dig> domain mutation e139d might interfere with shp <dig> binding to tryrosine-phosphorylated ligands. the other three mutants, y279c, n308d and q506p, are located in ptp domain, and the local conformational changes induced by each mutation provide insight into their abnormal catalytic properties. the results of our research provide structural insights into this medically important target and could aid in future structure-based drug discovery programs.
