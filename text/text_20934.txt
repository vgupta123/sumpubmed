BACKGROUND
scanning dna sequences for mutations and polymorphisms is an analytic tool in a broad range of disciplines. however, identification of such mutations and polymorphisms in long stretches of dna and in large numbers of samples by direct sequencing is not a trivial exercise. several mutation detection techniques based on the physical properties of single stranded dna or heteroduplex dna  <cit>  have been described. among such methods are conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis   <cit> , denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis   <cit> , constant denaturing capillary electrophoresis,   <cit> , temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis   <cit> , single strand conformation polymorphism   <cit>  and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography   <cit> . other methods exploit chemicals like groove binders or chemicals that cleave single strand dna at the mismatch site in heteroduplex dna  <cit> .

single strand specific nucleases have also been used to cleave heteroduplex dna at the mismatch site  <cit> . among them, cel i is a mismatch specific endonuclease  <cit>  that is widely used for reverse genetics in plants, animals and bacteria  <cit>  and for disease diagnostic in human such as cancers related to brca <dig>  <cit> . enzymatic mutation detection is advantageous over other popular mismatch detection systems, like tgce and dhplc  <cit>  because mismatch specific endonucleases allow to screen large stretches of dna without reducing diagnostic sensitivity or specificity, while at the same time providing information about the location of the mutation. however, many mismatch specific cleavage enzymes were reported to cleave preferentially certain types of mismatches, display low sensitivity or lead to a high background  <cit> .

previously, we reported the biochemical analysis of five s <dig> type nucleases from arabidopsis thaliana. we demonstrated that one of them, endo <dig>  is a mismatch specific endonuclease, which cleaves with a high efficiency all types of mismatches and has a high sensitivity, detecting one allele in pool of sixty  <cit> . here, we report a very simple protocol for the expression and the preparation of endo <dig>  especially, we report the use of endo <dig> in combination with universal labelled primers as a cost-effective tool for mutation diagnostics in humans, plants and viruses.

RESULTS
rapid preparation of endo1
endo <dig> is expressed at low level in arabidopsis during plant senescence  <cit> . in order to facilitate the expression of the protein, the endo <dig> orf was inserted between the 35s promoter and the transcriptional terminator of camv in the binary vector pbin <dig>   <cit> . the construct was transformed into agrobacterium and co-agroinfiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves in the presence of the p <dig> protein of tomato bushy stunt virus , that prevents the onset of post-transcriptional gene silencing  in infiltrated tissues and allows a high level of transient expression   <cit> . as negative control the plants were also agroinfiltrated with a construct expressing the green fluorescent protein .

ten grams of agroinfiltrated leaves were homogenized and cleared by centrifugation in the absence and in the presence of 30% ammonium sulphate. ammonium sulphate was then added to 80% final concentration in the supernatant and the pelleted proteins were resuspended in buffer containing 50% glycerol, dialysed against the same buffer and stored at -80°c.

to test whether endo <dig> obtained from this simplified purification protocol is active we tested the protein extract on heteroduplex dna created from two clones that differ by a single base insertion . in this experiment we predicted that if the endo <dig> preparation contains a mismatch specific endonuclease, the heteroduplex dna will be cleaved at the mismatch site releasing two bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp . duplex dnas were incubated with dilutions of endo <dig> or gfp protein extracts. endo <dig> led to the predicted digestion product and as expected the gfp control showed undetectable mismatch specific cleavage activity . as shown for his-tag purified endo <dig>  <cit>  and cel i  <cit> , at high concentration , endo <dig> presented double strand dnase activity and digested the entire fragments. from this biochemical analysis we concluded that endo <dig> simplified purification led to an active enzyme and the test mutation was detected at dilutions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> fold . based on this analysis and duplicates of this experiment , we estimate that the amount of enzyme produced from  <dig> grams of agroinfiltrated leaf material, and used at  <dig>  <dig> fold dilution, is enough to carry more than a million mismatch detection tests.

detection of g1691a mutation in factor v
we tested endo <dig> prepared as above in mutation diagnostics in humans. as a proof of concept, we investigated the detection of the factor v g1691a mutation associated with venous thrombosis  <cit> . genomic dna was extracted from individuals harboring or not the g1691a mutation and analyzed using endo <dig> system. to reduce the diagnostic cost, we combined the endo <dig> mismatch detection system with the use of labelled universal primers in the amplification of the target sequence . in this analysis we expected that if the  <dig> bp heteroduplex dna fragment of factor v is cleaved at the mismatch site, two bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp would be released . results obtained from both  <dig> and  <dig> channels of the li-cor <dig> show that endo <dig> recognizes the g1691a mutation . no cleavage was observed on pcr product obtained from a control person not carrying the g1691a mutation . the experiment was repeated three times with similar results . as expected the presence of g1691a mutation was confirmed by sequencing in the patient heterozygote for the mutation . because mutation detection relies on heteroduplex formation between two alleles, detection of the g1691a mutation at the homozygous state will require mixing genomic dna from a control individual not harbouring the mutation with that of an individual to be tested.

fingerprinting of hiv- <dig> quasispecies
human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  present in infected individuals has been described as quasispecies of related but distinct viruses  <cit> . when the selective pressure of antiretroviral therapy is exerted on such a population, drug-resistant mutants may emerge and consequently lead to treatment failure  <cit> . the objective of this work was to assess the hiv- <dig> quasispecies evolution during different treatments. direct sequencing of pcr amplified hiv- <dig> dna fragment from an infected individual will detect only predominant mutations. detailed analysis of the hiv quasispecies using sequencing would require the cloning of pcr products and systematic sequencing of individual clones. a list of alternative technologies have been also tested to identify minor hiv drug-resistant populations  <cit> .

previously we demonstrated that endo <dig> can detect rare alleles in pools of dna  <cit> . thus, we tested the use of endo <dig> system as a fingerprinting protocol to assess the hiv- <dig> quasispecies evolution during different treatments. we focused the analysis on the sequence variation in a dna fragment of  <dig> bp coding for the reverse transcriptase gene of hiv- <dig>  genomic dnas were extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an hiv- <dig> infected patient before  and after  <dig> weeks of antiretroviral therapy . the reverse transcriptase gene was pcr amplified and analysed using endo <dig>  two different patterns of bands, representing fingerprints of hiv- <dig> quasispecies at each time, were observed . comparing the overall patterns and changes in intensity of particular fragments allowed the identification of mutations that either appeared or were lost upon treatment . bands of invariant intensity indicate stable mutations .

exploitation of endo <dig> in tilling
tilling  method combines the induction of a high number of random mutations with mutagens like ethyl methane sulfonate  and mutational screening systems to discover induced mutations in sequence dna targets  <cit> . this reverse genetic strategy encompasses all types of organisms as plants, animals, bacteria, without being subjected to the genome size  <cit> .

to test whether endo <dig>  purified using the simplified protocol, in combination with universal primers is efficient in tilling, we screened  <dig> m <dig> families of pisum sativum-ems mutagenized population  for induced mutations in the retinoblastoma-related gene, rbr. the rbr protein is well-known as a regulator of cell division, differentiation and endoreduplication in plants  <cit> . so far, the use of insertion mutants to investigate the roles of rbr in plant development has been restricted, due to the gametophytic lethality  <cit> . two dna fragments of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp of rbr were pcr amplified using nested pcr in combination with universal primers . pcr products were digested with endo <dig> and analysed on li-cor <dig> gels as described above . from  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp amplicons we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> mutants, respectively . from this,  <dig> were intronic,  <dig> were silent and  <dig> were missense mutations. no nonsense mutants were recovered, likely because of their gametophytic deleterious effects  <cit> .

to evaluate the robustness of endo <dig> purified using the simplified protocol, in combination with universal primers for mutation detection, rbr tilling was carried out with conventional method based on ni-column-purified endo <dig> and gene specific primers. a similar number of mutants were identified . based on the tilling of rbr and other targets  we concluded that the endo <dig> simplified protocol is suitable for high throughput tilling screen.

exploitation of endo <dig> in eco-tilling
ecotilling is a means to determine the extent of natural sequence variation across many germplasms, enabling both snp discovery and haplotyping  <cit> . this technique is now applied to rice, maize, lotus, poplar  <cit> , brassica, zebrafish, drosophila, caenorhabditis and human  <cit> , indicating its broad applicability.

in arabidopsis thaliana, we analysed natural sequence variations within a dna fragment of  <dig> bp  using the endo <dig> system  and sequence analysis , in two arabidopsis ecotypes, columbia and landsberg. we expected that if the  <dig> bp heteroduplex dna fragment, created from columbia and landsberg pooled genomic dnas , is cleaved at the mismatch sites, four bands of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp would be released. results obtained from both channels  <dig> and  <dig> of the li-cor <dig> show that endo <dig> recognizes, with a high specificity the three base pair indel and the g to a substitution . no cleavage was observed on pcr product obtained from the control columbia and landsberg-homoduplex dnas . the obtaining of four bands indicates that endo <dig> cleaves the dna fragments partially. this characteristic of endo <dig> enhances the potential of the system, because it is able to detect sequence variation in a dna fragment carrying multiple mutations in a single reaction.

discussion
mutation detection is often an expensive and time-consuming obstacle to many molecular genetic applications including reverse genetics and clinical diagnostics. in this work we describe an enzymatic mutation detection technique based on endo <dig>  we focused our work on the main limitation of any enzymatic mutation detection system, the production of a mismatch specific endonuclease. cel i is the most commonly used endonuclease in tilling and ecotilling in plants and animals  <cit> . three protocols are reported for the purification of cel i from celery stalks. the highly purified enzyme is prepared from  <dig> kg of celery stalks and a more simplified protocol use  <dig> kg. both protocols use a series of chromatography purifications steps requiring special equipments and skills in biochemistry. a more simplified protocol was reported  <cit>  that use  <dig>  kg of store-bought celery stalks. however, the minimum information on the name of the celery variety and the age of the plants to be used in the purification are missing, which renders the quality of produced enzyme uneven.

in this work, the co-agroinfiltration of endo <dig> and p <dig> constructs into n. benthamiana leaves allowed high level of transient expression. endo <dig> represented at least 6% of total proteins  and from  <dig> grams of plant material, we routinely obtain enough enzyme to carry out more than a millions mismatch detection tests. the crude purified endo <dig> was found to be stable, allowing at least  <dig> months storage at -20°c. for longer period storage we recommend to purify his-tagged endo <dig> on ni-nta agarose beads as described previously  <cit> . the his-tag purified endo <dig> was found to be very stable, allowing at least two years storage at -80°c, one year storage at -20°c and more than four months storage at 4°c.

several new techniques of mutation scanning based on microchips and/or sequencing or re-sequencing of a given genome are currently being developed  <cit> ; however, these technologies yet have in common the major drawback of their cost. such tools, despite their outstanding potential for mutation scanning, are now likely to be restricted for such applications to big laboratories specialised in sequencing or genotyping. on the other hand, using endo <dig> system, we demonstrated its universality as a low-cost strategy for easy high-throughput diagnostic of genetic mutations in different genomes, including those incompletely sequenced like pea. in humans, the endo <dig> system permitted the diagnosis of the well-known genetic mutation, g1691a in factor v gene, which is often associated with activated protein c resistance that is a common risk factor for venous thrombosis  <cit> . in viruses, we described a fingerprinting protocol to assess the hiv- <dig> quasispecies evolution during different treatments. we showed that the detection of quasispecies using universal primers with two pcr-rounds or using specific primers in one pcr-round gave the same results . the natural progression of viral species within hiv- <dig> infected patients and/or the correlation of the appearance of quasispecies with the resistance to certain antiretroviral could be essential for clinical survey. in plants, we demonstrated the use of endo <dig> in combination with universal primers to decrease further the cost of the screening in tilling and eco-tilling, two strategies that require high throughput screening protocols.

the agrobacterium transient-expression assay could be used not only to produce  large amounts of endo <dig>  but also to over-express other nucleases for which the expression in bacteria is toxic or require post-translational modifications. initial attempts to express endo <dig> and cel i in e. coli were unsuccessful and when we succeeded, the expressed proteins showed no dnase activity .

CONCLUSIONS
the endo <dig> preparation protocol described in this work does not require any particular equipment or skills and could be implemented in any standard molecular biology research laboratory. the produced endo <dig> was successfully used in mutations diagnostics in different genomes. in humans, the endo <dig> system permitted the diagnosis of the well-known genetic mutation in factor v gene, which is often associated with venous thrombosis. in viruses, we described a fingerprinting protocol to assess the hiv- <dig> quasispecies evolution during different treatments. in plants, we demonstrated the use of endo <dig> in combination with universal primers to decrease further the cost of tilling and eco-tilling.
