BACKGROUND
canine infectious diarrhea has been considered a challenge for veterinarians because of its pathogenic variability and the concurrent presence of viral, bacterial, and protozoan co-infections  <cit> . whereas some pathogens remain on the mucosal surface and produce potent enterotoxins that can disrupt the fluid flux, others penetrate and replicate within intact epithelial cells, producing inflammatory damage and/or destroying the host cells, which are overlapping pathological processes  <cit> . however, many dogs harbor potential pathogens without any clinical signs, so the cause–effect relationships are far from clear.

molecular tools have been used for the identification and diagnosis of infectious diseases, in addition to conventional culture techniques and antibody-based tools  <cit> . among these molecular approaches, the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction  has greatly improved the sensitivity and sensibility of standard pcr assays of pathogens in canine fecal samples  <cit> .

therefore, although a number of pathogens have been individually detected with real-time pcr, including salmonella spp.  <cit>  and pathogenic escherichia coli strains  <cit> , a comprehensive panel of potentially diarrhea-causing pathogens in owned dogs is yet to be established. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate pathogenic co-infections in populations of diarrheic and control owned dogs using a real-time pcr analysis of a panel of diarrhea-causing agents.

RESULTS
real-time pcr
potential enteropathogens were identified in 71/ <dig>  diarrheic samples in the present study, most of which contained multiples pathogens. single infections were observed in 39/ <dig>  positive samples and co-infection in 32/ <dig>  possible samples. dual, triple, and quadruple infections were observed among the co-infections . the most prevalent agent involved in co-infections was canine parvovirus type  <dig> , and 21/ <dig>  of the diarrheic samples positive for cpv- <dig> were associated with others agents, most commonly with clostridium perfringens alpha toxin , cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp. although 13/ <dig>  of the feces samples from the control dogs were positive for the panel of diarrhea-causing pathogens, no co-infection was observed in any of these samples.

of the 71/ <dig>  dogs with diarrhea and positive results,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % had pure viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections, respectively, whereas  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of samples from the control dogs were positive for viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections, respectively. the association of viral and bacterial infections was the most prevalent type of co-infection in the diarrheic group , with cpv- <dig> and canine coronavirus  constituting  <dig> % of this type of co-infection. viral and protozoan co-infections accounted for  <dig> % of these associations, bacterial and protozoan for  <dig> %, and viral, bacterial, and protozoan co-infections for  <dig> % .

a significant association was found between dogs with diarrhea and positive results on the real-time pcr diarrhea panel compared with the control dogs with normal feces .

the detection of individual pathogens in the panel with real-time pcr  showed that cpa was the most prevalent pathogen in the fecal samples, infecting 40/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs and 6/ <dig>  control dogs, and the difference between the groups was highly statistically significant . despite this, it was necessary to quantify cpa to consider its probable role. when the pre-established cutoff of >  <dig>  copies/g of feces was applied  <cit> , a significant difference  between the control group  and the diarrheic group  was observed. cpv- <dig> was the second most prevalent pathogen, found in 36/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs and 0/ <dig>  control dogs, and also showed a highly significant difference between the groups .

although 9/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs were positive for canine distemper virus , the difference between the diarrheic and control dogs was not significant . similarly, 12/ <dig>  diarrheic and 3/ <dig>  control dogs were positive for ccov, and these rates were not significantly different .

only 1/ <dig>  and 8/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs were positive for salmonella spp. and cryptosporidium spp., respectively. in the control group only 2/ <dig>  were positive for cryptosporidium spp., and the two groups did not differ significantly . although giardia spp. were detected in 14/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs and 2/ <dig>  control dogs, the difference was not significant .

diarrhea in relation to age
among the diarrheic samples, 43/ <dig> were from 0–1-year-old dogs, 36/ <dig> from 1–8-year-old dogs, and 25/ <dig> from dogs >  <dig> years old. the pcr results were positive in 39/ <dig>  samples from animals 0–1 years old, in 20/ <dig>  samples from those 1–8 years old, and 12/ <dig>  samples from those >  <dig> years old. a significant association was observed between dog age and the pathogens cpv- <dig> , giardia spp. , and ccov , which were most prevalent among the 0–1-year-old dogs. although cpv- <dig> is considered to be primarily a disease of puppies, it also occurred in 4/ <dig>  animals aged 1–8 years and in 3/ <dig>  dogs aged >  <dig> years. only 13/ <dig>  of the positive animals for cpv- <dig> had no history of vaccination, in which 1/ <dig>  and 1/ <dig>  were adults with 1-8 years and  <dig> years respectively. details of dates and brands of the vaccines were not obtained. there was a highly significant association between age and co-infection , which was more prevalent among the 0–1-year-old dogs, of which 25/ <dig>  had co-infections with two or more pathogens. co-infection occurred less often in the other age groups, occurring in 5/ <dig>  dogs in the 1–8-year-old group and 3/ <dig>  dogs >  <dig> years old. a significantly higher prevalence  of viral and protozoan associations was observed in the 0–1-year-old diarrheic dogs than in the other age groups. however, no significant associations between the other co-infections and age were observed.

diarrhea duration in relation to number of pathogens
no significant association  was observed between the duration of diarrhea and the presence of single or co-infections.

diarrhea in relation to death
the presence of co-infection did not increase the number of deaths  more than the presence of a single infection.

diarrhea in relation to clinical suspicion
in this study, even when diarrhea lasted for more than  <dig> days, an infectious disease was still clinically suspected .

diarrhea in relation to the use of antibiotics
during the period from sample collection to the generation of results for the diarrhea panel analysis , 40/ <dig>  dogs received empirical treatment with combinations of two to four antibiotics. in total, 40/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs with positive pcr results were treated with antibiotics that were, according to the literature, inappropriate for the pathogens ultimately identified.

parasitological diagnosis
in total, 20/ <dig>  and 3/ <dig>  fecal samples from diarrheic and control dogs, respectively, were positive on parasitological tests. the most prevalent intestinal parasites found in the diarrheic samples were protozoa , which affected 12/ <dig>  dogs, and helminths , which affected 10/ <dig>  dogs. all the parasites found in the three positive control samples were identified as ancylostoma sp. when all the samples from diarrheic and control dogs were considered, 22/ <dig>  positive fecal samples and 61/ <dig>  negative fecal samples on parasitological tests were also positive on the real-time pcr diarrhea panel.

of the 13/ <dig>  samples positive for helminths , 12/ <dig>  were also positive on the real-time pcr. among the 134/ <dig>  samples negative for helminths, 71/ <dig>  were positive on the real-time pcr. dogs positive for helminths were  <dig>  times more likely to be positive on the real-time pcr diarrhea panel, which indicates a statistically significant association  between the infections detected with real-time pcr and the presence of helminths.

of the 16/ <dig>  samples shown to be positive for giardia spp. with real-time pcr, only five were positive on the parasitological tests. considering that real-time pcr is the gold standard for the detection of pathogenic agents, the parasitological test showed  <dig> % sensitivity . isospora spp. were found in 7/ <dig>  samples with the parasitological test, and all of these samples were also positive for the agents detected with real-time pcr, suggesting that isospora spp. are usually involved in co-infections.

discussion
a high prevalence  of diarrheic dogs, shown to harbor at least one pathogen by real-time pcr, was observed in the brazilian samples, which exceeded those in the united states , australia , canada , united kingdom , and japan , as shown in table  <dig>  the rate of co-infection observed here in diarrheic dogs  was also higher than those in the other countries tested. despite the higher prevalence of enteropathogens and co-infections in brazil, the rates in the other countries are also relevant, indicating that infectious diarrhea may be a global phenomenon rather than a phenomenon specific to a particular country. because all dogs with co-infections belonged to the diarrheic group and co-infections were observed in all age categories, this study highlights the importance of investigating multipathogen co-infections, especially in dogs aged 0–1 years, in which the rate of co-infection was 4-fold higher than in the other age groups.

many enteric viruses, bacterial pathogens, and parasites probably contribute to disease both individually and in combination  <cit> , and together, co-infecting pathogens may cause more severe diarrhea than infections with each pathogen alone  <cit> . the pathogens involved in a co-infection can interact synergistically, for example via the host’s immune system, with the presence of one enhancing the abundance and/or virulence of the other, resulting in even greater pathogenesis and a greater contribution to the overall disease burden  <cit> . therefore, interspecific pathogen interactions can alter the pathogen dynamics, host health, and the success of control strategies  <cit> .

in this study, co-infection did not increase the duration of diarrhea and there was no significant difference in the number of deaths in animals with or without co-infections. because there was no reliable correlation between the interaction of enteropathogens in co-infections in this study, the cause–effect relationship between the presence of an organism and the occurrence of diarrhea is still unclear. opportunistic or commensal organisms may be identified from an imbalance in the intestinal flora or dysbiosis, and not all the co-infecting agents present must be treated to produce a good outcome. however, because all the infectious agents evaluated here have been described as causing diarrhea in experimental studies, knowledge of their presence allows treatments and prevention strategies to be planned. in this study, even when diarrhea persisted for more than  <dig> days, the infectious diseases were still present in the differential diagnosis. empirical treatments and the use of several antibiotics are common in routine veterinary practice and the use of a panel to detect multiples pathogens prevents the incorrect or excessive use of antimicrobial drugs, which could cause resistance. furthermore, some of these pathogens are potential zoonotic agents, including hookworms, giardia spp., cryptosporidium spp., and salmonella spp., and the identification of these organisms can reduce the risk of their transmission to humans and others animals.

although this study focused on client-owned dogs, dogs received in animal shelters are also expected to carry pathogen co-infections, including zoonotic agents  <cit> . however, differences have been observed in the prevalence of each agent, especially in terms of the co-infection rates, and dogs from shelters with diarrhea showed a higher prevalence of co-infection   <cit>  than was observed in this study . that heterogeneous dog population had a higher rate of crowding, and the dogs may have been immunocompromised for clinical, nutritional, and/or psychological reasons, exposed to more environmental pathogens, and sometimes with inadequate health care, so their high co-infection rate cannot be compared validly with that of owned dogs in households.

the highest rate of co-infection in this study involved the association of viral and bacterial agents, in contrast to the highest co-infection in dogs in the united states, which was caused by viruses and protozoans. the highest co-infection rates were for cpv- <dig> and cpa, observed in 9/ <dig>  samples from dogs in brazil, and for ccov and giardia spp., which occurred together in  <dig> % of dogs from the united states. these co-infections may have clinical effects and may require more-intensive efforts to ensure the appropriate treatments to eliminate specific pathogens and to correct electrolyte, acid–base, and nutritional disturbances, potential sepsis, and other metabolic consequences  <cit> .

the alpha toxin gene is present in all strains of clostridium perfringens and may be found in asymptomatic dogs as part of the normal intestinal microflora  <cit> , as in 14% of the control dogs in the present study. data from some studies indicate that conventional pcr that targets only cpa will almost always be positive and of virtually no clinical use  <cit> . however, a recent study demonstrated that the quantification of cpa may be used as a diagnostic marker for association of the agent in patients with diarrhea  <cit> . using the same methodology and cutoff value as a previous study  <cit> , we observed a significant difference between the control group  and in the diarrheic group  in the proportion of animals positive for >  <dig>  copies of cpa. the higher amount of cpa in the diarrheic dogs than in the control dogs suggests that the high concentrations of toxins produced by this organism exert a pathogenic effect on the gastrointestinal tract. in the present study, diarrheic dogs co-infected with cpa had 3-fold more copies than those that were infected with only cpa. we hypothesize that in these cases, c. perfringens overgrowth in the bacterial flora increases the toxin expressed, which contributes to the dog’s diarrhea.

all the control dogs were negative for cpv- <dig>  which was strongly associated with diarrhea , with an overall occurrence of 36/ <dig>  in the diarrheic dogs. the same prevalence  was observed in a study also conducted in brazil but performed only with puppies up to  <dig> months old  <cit>  and corroborated with previous surveys, which reported rates varying from 16%  <cit>  to 58%  <cit> . although cpv- <dig> has been considered to be primarily disease of puppies, the present study has shown the importance of also investigating adult dogs for cpv- <dig>  since occurred in  <dig> % of 1– <dig> year old dogs and in  <dig> % of dogs older than  <dig> years. the cpv- <dig> was most prevalent agent involved in co-infections in this study, in which  <dig> % of the diarrheic samples positive for cpv- <dig> were associated with others agents, contrasting with only  <dig> % cpv- <dig> co-infection observed in the study with puppies  <cit> . this variability may be related to the geographic regions examined, the populations studied, agents investigated and the diagnostic techniques used  <cit> . although the date of live-modified vaccination was not the focus of this study, the cpv- <dig> cutoff value used was able to differentiate vaccine strains from wild-type infections. despite the use of vaccination, the cpv- <dig> was still spread among the dogs as observed in this study, in which only 13/ <dig>  of the positive animals for cpv- <dig> had no history of vaccination. still remains unclear whether type- <dig> vaccines can provide protection against the new variants of the cpv, but a recent study observed that the cases of vaccine failure are most likely not associated to the mutations detected in the sequenced regions  <cit> . thus, further studies should elucidate whether local parvovirus strains are effectively controlled by the currently available vaccines and which factors may be associated with the vaccination efficacy. cpv- <dig> was the most prevalent agent associated with dual co-infections in the present study, which may be attributable to highly contaminated environments or low dog immunity  <cit> .

although the detection rate of ccov was higher in the diarrheic dogs  than in the control dogs , the lack of a statistically significant difference in these rates may indicate a secondary role for ccov as an intestinal pathogen in dogs. although the shedding of cpv- <dig> seemed to be associated with clinical signs of gastroenteritis, ccov was also detected in healthy dogs, as previously reported  <cit> . although ccov infections are characterized by high morbidity and low mortality, with typically mild enteritis in dogs  <cit> , 11/ <dig>  diarrheic dogs with ccov were co-infected with other enteric pathogens, which may have aggravated their clinical signs and even caused higher mortality, as reported earlier for cpv- <dig>  <cit> , canine adenovirus type  <dig>  <cit> , and cdv  <cit> . cdv tended to be significantly higher in the diarrheic dogs than in the control dogs; although not significant, the p value was very close to the limit of significance .

whereas some enteropathogens, such as salmonella spp., cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp., showed similar prevalences in the various countries tested , cdv and cpv- <dig> were approximately 4-fold more prevalent in brazil, indicating that the higher incidence of viral diseases may be related to differences in strain pathogenicity, vaccination status, and environmental factors.

although the cpv- <dig> strain and vaccine status/response may play important roles in viral infection and host immunity, further studies are required to fully understand this specific pattern of cpv- <dig> infections in brazil.

although intestinal parasites contribute to diarrhea,  <dig> % of positive and  <dig> % negative samples on the parasitological tests were also positive on the real-time pcr diarrhea panel, indicating that fecal parasitological tests alone should not be used as a single diagnostic tool.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time pcr-based analysis of a panel of diarrhea-causing pathogens performed in brazil. our results indicate that dogs with diarrhea show a relatively high prevalence of pathogenic infections, highlighting the importance of investigating infectious pathogens in dogs with diarrhea. whereas asymptomatic dogs had single infections only, approximately half the diarrheic dogs presented with co-infections, emphasizing the importance of the simultaneous investigation of multiple pathogens in individual samples. the most prevalent pathogens in diarrheic dogs in brazil were c. perfringens alpha toxin, cpv- <dig>  and giardia spp. among the dual co-infections observed, cpv- <dig> was most commonly associated with c. perfringens alpha toxin, cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp.

in this study, co-infection did not increase the duration of diarrhea or increase the risk of death. however, considering that all the infectious agents examined have been described as causing diarrhea in experimental studies, knowledge of their presence should allow us to plan treatments and prevention strategies. the effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear, because neither the death rate nor the duration of diarrhea seemed to be affected by these factors.
