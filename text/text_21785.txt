BACKGROUND
numerous studies have been devoted to the identification of transcription factor -binding sites or other regulatory elements in bacterial genomes. so far, most large-scale approaches relied heavily on statistics and the input of known binding motifs  <cit> . unfortunately, purely statistical approaches are seriously hampered by the trade-off that exists between a high true-positive rate and a low false-negative rate of the prediction. nonetheless, both rates can be considerably improved by taking advantage of additional data  <cit>  like, for instance, sequence data from related species  <cit> , structural information  <cit>  or transcriptome data  <cit> . another way to enhance the accuracy is phylogenetic footprinting which takes both 'phylogeny' and 'synteny' into account <cit> .

we have recently developed a large-scale automated regulatory motif prediction method for prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . it was applied with success in the identification of a relatively large number of regulatory motifs in genomes of the firmicutes, a phylum that comprises many well-studied families like the bacillaceae, clostridiaceae, lactobacillaceae, staphylococcaceae and streptococcaceae. the identified motifs included several new motifs besides known ones. nevertheless, in many cases the method appeared less suited to couple a specific tf or signal to the regulatory motif in a straightforward manner. for example, although the characteristic t-box motif was easily identified – the t-box is a regulatory element that responds to uncharged t-rna  <cit>  and is found in all firmicutes – the amino acid specificity of that element was not retrieved for the individual instances automatically . likewise, the 'cre-like' motif that was retrieved is very similar to known operator motifs of various tfs of the laci-family, suggesting that the recovered motif is not specific.

the laci-family of tfs plays a crucial role in many bacterial species, and certainly in those of the phylum firmicutes, as these tfs mediate preferences in the utilization of certain carbohydrates over others. the prioritization involves both repression  of catabolic genes  in the absence  of a related substrate and  in the presence  of a preferred substrate  <cit> . the latter process is referred to as carbon catabolite repression  and its main mediator in firmicutes species is ccpa  <cit> . ccpa operators were called cres  and a cre consensus motif was defined on basis of experiments in various firmicutes species  <cit> . the consensus motif is very similar to, and sometimes coincides with, operators related to other tfs of the laci-family  <cit> . most family members, however, interact with only a few operators on the genome, like laci of escherichia coli, which represses specifically the lac-operon in the absence of lactose  <cit> . this raises the question how these bacteria coordinate 'local'  and 'global'  regulatory effects using homologous tfs.

thus, the lack in specificity of the current prediction methods is a key issue in case one wants to disentangle complex regulatory relationships, like between those of the tfs of the laci-family and the operons involved in carbohydrate catabolism. therefore, we have formulated a comprehensive sequence-based comparative approach for the prediction of tf-specific operators in bacteria. specificity is ensured by building upon a proper phylogenetic classification of each family of tfs  and very strict criteria to define synteny.

the value of the approach was put to the test on the well-described laci-family of tfs, and more specifically, to uncover the regulatory connections of the  <dig> laci-family tfs in l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  this species was chosen as a representative of the phylum firmicutes, as it is an industrially and medically relevant model organism that is encountered in very different environmental niches, i.e. in association with plants, fermenting food and feed, and in the animal and human gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . the approach proved successful and each laci-family tf of l. plantarum was linked to a putative operator motif and thereby to a putative regulon. in addition, several principles that should govern laci-family tf mediated 'local' and 'global' transcription regulation could be inferred from the results. ample experimental and structural information was used to evaluate and support the predictions and inferences.

RESULTS
i) a comprehensive approach to identify tf-specific operators
it has been observed consistently that orthologous protein sequences  <cit>  are very likely to have molecular properties that are alike  <cit> . similarly, synteny – conserved gene order – was found to be a strong indicator of functional equivalency  <cit> . thus, genes that are orthologous and share 'gene context' can be assumed to be functionally more equivalent than orthologous genes that are not syntenous. based on this premise we formulated a generic phylogenetic footprinting  <cit> /shadowing  <cit>  approach for the identification of tf-specific operator sequences in bacteria . high specificity in the motif prediction was achieved by properly classifying orthologous tfs into groups that share gene context to yield putative groups of orthologous functional equivalents or goofes. to develop the approach, we chose the well-described laci-family of transcriptional regulators , limiting the analysis to firmicutes and focusing specifically on the model organism lactobacillus plantarum wcfs <dig>  which has a high number of laci-family tfs for which we have ample experimental and transcriptome data for validation.

collect homologs: laci-family tfs in the genomes of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> and other firmicutes
the search for laci-family tf specific operators was initiated by collecting the laci-family tf protein sequences from taxonomically related genomes and grouping them using the neighbor joining  algorithm . the resulting nj-tree indicated a clear separation between two subfamilies of laci-family tf homologs . one subfamily represented the vast majority of laci-family tf homologs including ccpa, whereas the other represented only  <dig> to  <dig> homologs per species. the latter subfamily contained one well-studied tf from e. coli, the evolved beta-galactosidase repressor or ebgr  <cit> . henceforth, the two laci-family tf subfamilies will be referred to as 'ccpa-like' and 'ebgr-like'. the number of laci-family tf homologs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and the homolog composition was found highly variable between different species and also variable between strains  and correlated roughly with genome size. for example, although all  <dig> laci-family tfs of pediococcus pentosaceus  <cit>  were orthologous to a laci-family tf in l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  only  <dig> out of  <dig> where orthologous in lactobacillus brevis  <cit> , another close relative. moreover, when the laci-family tf content of various strains of l. plantarum was analyzed – the data were derived from a strain diversity analysis  <cit>  – it appeared that apart from ccpa none of the individual laci-family genes was present in all other strains. in fact, the master regulator ccpa was the only laci-family member present in all sequenced firmicutes genomes.

determine synteny: identification of tf-specific binding motifs
inspection of the gene-neighborhood of the genes encoding laci-family tf homologs in l. plantarum indicated that most of them are associated with genes encoding proteins that catabolize carbohydrates. although the gene association appeared conserved in other genomes, it was mostly only true for a limited number of species. a tf-specific goofe was defined for each l. plantarum laci-family tf on basis of context conservation and then the upstream regions preceding the conserved operons/genes were selected . multiple sequence alignments, motif-finding methods, as well as visual inspection, were then used to identify potential goofe-specific laci-family tf operator motifs for all  <dig> laci-family tfs . a first comparison of the motifs, depicted in figure  <dig>  showed that the 'ccpa-like' and 'ebgr-like' laci-family tf operators had characteristic yet distinct subfamily traits. the 'ccpa-like' operators carry a central cg nucleotide pair, whereas the 'ebgr-like' operators have only a single central c or g nucleotide. moreover, within the subfamilies, the motifs appeared to be discretely different in at least one position.

validation: comparison of the predicted motifs with experimental functional data from literature
compelling evidence that the recovered motifs were genuine and the approach was effective came from a comparison of the motif predictions with experimentally characterized operators. in all cases that could be checked, the prediction was in full agreement with the experimental findings. this was true for ccpa in lactobacilli  <cit> , for the lp_ <dig> ortholog lacr in lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  <cit> , for the lp_ <dig> ortholog galr in streptococcus thermophilus  <cit>  and in streptococcus mutans  <cit> , as well as for malr in stretococcus pneumoniae  <cit> , for mali in e. coli  <cit>  and for exur in bacillus subtilis  <cit>  .

 this consensus is based on the experimentally verified operators listed in this reference

validation: comparison of the predicted with 3-d structure information from literature
it also proved possible to use structural information on the binding of several laci-family members to their respective operator  <cit>  to validate predicted motifs. differences in the conservation of certain amino acid residues in the dna-binding domain of the tf were compared to the composition of the connected operator. two clear correlations between protein sequence and operator sequence were found :

- firstly, the structural data suggest that, in the case of ccpa and laci, the conserved arginine located at position  <dig> is one of the few residues that hydrogen bonds directly with one of the nucleotide bases, a guanine at position - <dig> of the operator  <cit> . in lp_ <dig>  and its orthologs, the arginine is replaced by a glutamine  and correspondingly the otherwise 'conserved' guanine is replaced by a thymidine. in fact, such a replacement was observed for all other studied laci-family tfs deviant at position  <dig> . these anomalous tfs include mali from e. coli which was proven experimentally to indeed bind an operator with a thymidine at position - <dig>  <cit>  .

- secondly, the 'ebgr-like' tfs , lp_ <dig>  and lp_ <dig> ) are expected to have distinct dna-binding features. members of this subfamily lack the conserved leucine residue  that according to the 3d-structure of operator-bound ccpa  <cit>  intercalates between the central cg base pairs that are characteristic for 'ccpa-like' operators  <cit> . concordantly, the predicted 'ebgr-like' laci-family tf operators lack the central cg nucleotide pair. possibly, the conserved arginine at position  <dig> interacts with the conserved single c or g nucleotide in the operator .

ii) identification of the biological role of a tf through comparative genomics
the biological role of a transcription factor is to activate or repress the transcription of certain genes in response to the presence of a signal . in principle, once the sequence of a tf-specific operator is known, a genome-wide search for the related motif could be used to find putative tf-binding sites on the genome and to establish the regulated functionalities . the signal that triggers the transcriptional response can be obtained by linking the specific tf to an ortholog that has experimentally verified 'inducer' specificities. finally, the transcriptional effect  of the binding of the tf can be deduced from the relative position of the putative binding site with respect to the promoter  <cit> .

regulon predictions for the laci-family tf homologs in l. plantarum wcfs1
the  <dig> predicted specific operator motifs were used to search the genome for potential tf-binding sites. for each of the identified specific motifs an initial list of  <dig> to  <dig> putative binding sites was retrieved and the list was reduced by application of a distance and similarity criterion to yield a few putative highly specific binding sites per tf . not surprisingly, the 'best hits' included those sites that were used to create the search motif in the first place. however, they also included multiple sites that were not used as input. for instance in l. plantarum, new lp_ <dig>  operators were detected upstream of the operon comprising the gene lp_ <dig>  and upstream of the neighboring operon. furthermore, the notion that auto-regulation is an important feature connected to laci-family tf mediated regulation  <cit>  was confirmed within l. plantarum, by the identification of a specific binding site upstream of all laci-family tfs with the exception of lp_ <dig>  lp_ <dig>  and lp_ <dig> . it is generally accepted that auto-regulation provides stability to a transcriptional network  <cit> .

as expected, most potential binding sites were identified upstream of operons that encoded functionalities related to the catabolism of particular carbohydrates. in l. plantarum wcfs <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> laci-family tfs were found to be associated with active carbohydrate transport systems . furthermore, the size of the putative regulons varied slightly. for instance, the putative regulon of lp_ <dig> encompassed only one operon, whereas that of lp_ <dig> encompassed five operons . although the putative regulon of ccpa was the largest, it was still limited in size, which is slightly in contrast with the global role of ccpa  <cit> . the precise composition and functionality of most of the predicted regulons is discussed in some detail in additional file  <dig> 

the molecular function of laci-family tfs and the connection with the predicted biological role
the functional similarity between homologs can be derived from a proper phylogeny of all homologous sequences  <cit> . however, the low bootstrap support for the 'early' branches in the nj-tree of all laci homologs made it impossible to deduce functional similarities between the members of different clusters of orthologous sequences . it was observed by us  and others  <cit>  that generating a nj-tree of intra-species homologs of specific functional domains is extremely helpful to overcome this problem. to obtain putative links with experimental functional data, orthologous sequences linked with experimentally verified 'inducer' specificities can be added. the branching pattern within such a nj-tree for the laci-family tfs of l. plantarum  and the bootstrap support for that pattern, suggested clear similarities in the encoded affinity for certain inducer substrates. it must be noted here that 'inducer' does not necessarily mean that the binding of the tf to the dna is promoted by the particular molecule. in fact, in many cases the interaction with the 'inducer' causes a release of the laci-family tf from the dna and thereby a relief from repression .

the identification of various additional sites whose presence should be expected  supported the view that the approach yielded genuine tf-specific binding sites. other support for the validity of the identified sites and regulons was provided by a comparison of the functionalities encoded by the regulons and the molecules that induced the activity  of the related tfs. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show that in almost all cases a straightforward metabolic link existed between the predicted regulated functionality and the assigned 'inducer' of the tf. for example in l. plantarum, lp_ <dig>  is predicted to respond to sucrose or oligofructose, a prediction that was derived from experimental evidence obtained for orthologous tfs  <cit> . concordantly, its putative operators are found upstream of two operons that harbor the genes encoding an active oligofructose/sucrose uptake system  <cit>  and enzymes that catalyze the conversion of the phosphorylated oligosaccharide into phosphorylated disaccharide and the phosphorylated disaccharide into glucose-6-p and fructose.

some of the predicted regulatory connections could be substantiated directly by published transcription data for l. plantarum or related species. on the other hand, the predictions also could often not be extrapolated in a straightforward way. for instance, similar to the prediction for l. plantarum, the expression of the ribose utilization operon  in l. sakei was shown to be controlled by rbsr and induced by ribose  <cit> . unfortunately, the induction of other operons was not studied. another example is provided by transcriptome data for l. plantarum grown on short-chain fructooligosaccharides compared to glucose. as predicted, expression of the divergon associated with lp_ <dig> was induced under these conditions  <cit> . nevertheless, the maltase/sucrase encoding gene lp_ <dig> that was predicted to be controlled by lp_ <dig>  was not induced. this observation could very well relate to additional factors that are involved in the regulation of the particular gene. an example of the subtle differences between species is found for the regulation of the gal operon  and lac operon . in s. mutans  <cit> , s. thermophilus cnrz  <dig>  <cit>  and s. salivarius  <cit>  expression of the gal operon, as well as that of galm and the lac operon in s. thermophilus and s. salivarius was shown to be controlled by galr and induced by galactose. our predictions suggest that in l. plantarum the gal operon is similarly controlled by the galr ortholog lp_ <dig>  the lac-operon in l. plantarum however, was predicted to be controlled by a paralogous laci-family tf, lp_ <dig> , that is absent from the streptococci, but which is present in l. acidophilus where it was shown to regulate an integrated lac-gal operon  <cit> . at the same time, in some strains of another lactobacillus species  the lac-operon was shown again to be controlled by an ortholog of lp_ <dig> .

the mode of action: repression or activation
although, the nomenclature of most laci-family tfs hints that their main mode of operation is repression , for ccpa it has been shown that it can also act as activator  <cit> . in lactococcus lactis, activation by ccpa was observed when the central nucleotide of the cre was located at position - <dig> or - <dig> with respect to the -35-sequence of the promoter and repression by ccpa, when it was located around positions - <dig>  - <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig> and further downstream  <cit> . the characteristic intervals of  <dig> or  <dig>  bases were ascribed to a helix-face dependence of the regulatory activity. a similar dependence had been observed before in the activation of acka transcription in b. subtilis  <cit> . the footprints accumulated in figure  <dig>  indicated that most laci-family tfs in l. plantarum are indeed expected to act as repressor. moreover, in all cases the predicted operators are found at the expected characteristic positions with respect to the promoter.

regulatory overlap between laci-tfs
another interesting aspect of the predicted regulatory connections that became apparent from inspection of the footprints in figure  <dig> was that many operons appear to be preceded by multiple laci-specific putative operators. for example, the two neighboring operons involved in sucrose/oligofructose transport and catabolism are preceded by two putative lp_ <dig>  operators. it was shown that transcription of these operons is indeed induced simultaneously  <cit> . this observation fits the assumption that one of the operators controls the transcription in one direction and the other in the opposite direction. conversely, two divergently transcribed genes can in principle also be controlled by a single operator. the latter was shown to be the case in the transcriptional control of the gene levr and the operon levabcdx in lactobacillus casei  <cit>  and in the transcriptional control of the genes pepq and ccpa in l. delbrueckii  <cit>  and l. lactis  <cit> . the genes pepq and ccpa are similarly organized in l. plantarum. furthermore, upstream of the ccpa gene three different putative promoter sites can be distinguished and every promoter seems to be connected to its own ccpa operator. this finding is in line with the experimental evidence provided by  <cit> . nevertheless, based on the relative positions of the putative cres, the effect of ccpa on its own expression is extremely difficult to predict of hand. ccpa seems to act as activator as well as repressor depending on the actual promoter.

the role of tf concentration
the molecular nature of the interaction between tf and operator dictates that the actual binding of the two will be dependent upon the activity  of both. consequently, the occupancy of any binding site by a certain tf can be raised by raising tf concentration. in fact, a relatively high tf concentration is anticipated for ccpa  <cit> . to get some idea of the relative concentrations of the laci-family tfs in l. plantarum, transcript levels obtained under different growth conditions were inspected . the observed transcript levels suggested that except for lp_ <dig>  all laci-family tfs are under some conditions expressed to relatively intermediate levels and lp_ <dig> , lp_ <dig> , lp_ <dig>  and ccpb even to levels as high as, or even higher than ccpa.

discussion
a generic method to identify tf-specific operators
every line of evidence sustains the validity of the approach we have formulated to identify laci-family tf specific operator motifs. in all cases where a laci-family tf operator has been characterized experimentally, our prediction is in full agreement . and likewise, several correlations between the tf sequence  and operator sequence  that are anticipated on basis of structural information  <cit>  were retrieved perfectly. moreover, the fact that a specific operator motif could be identified for every laci-family tf and that relatively few proper hits for these operator motifs were found on the complete genome, is proof by itself. more non-specific methods inevitably would have yielded more degenerate motifs and more false-positive identifications.

in lactic acid bacteria many operons involved in carbohydrate catabolism are associated on the genome by the gene encoding the respective regulator  <cit> . in fact, this observation may be generalized for all tfs that are considered 'local' regulators. our results indicate that especially for these tfs, a distribution into groups of orthologous functional equivalents will reduce the noise in the motif prediction significantly. in contrast, as current automated methods generate more degenerate motifs  <cit>  these methods are better suited for the recovery of binding sites for 'global' regulators.

characteristic motifs and the implications of degeneracy
as the interaction between tf and dna allows for a certain structural freedom, a tf-specific operator is not necessarily a unique sequence but merely a collection of sequences which can be represented as a motif or consensus sequence. the molecular nature of the interactions dictates a distinct relationship between the affinity of the tf protein for the operator dna and their respective sequence. as a consequence, a more degenerate operator motif relates to reduced affinity. for example, the laci-family tf cytr in e. coli exhibits a more versatile binding of operator sequences than laci . at the same time it was observed that its affinity for the operator is much reduced when compared to laci  <cit> . likewise, the affinity of the tf for the operator was shown to be affected significantly by subtle changes in the protein sequence  <cit>  as well as in the nucleotide sequence of the operator . lehming et al. therefore  <cit>  assumed explicitly that the interaction between tf and operator should be concentration dependent. ultimately, it is the relation between the concentration  of active tf and the rate of expression that determines key features of the dynamics of the cellular response to internal and external signals  <cit> .

the predicted specific operator motifs of the laci-family tfs in l. plantarum exhibit relatively little degeneracy  with one exception: the operator motif of ccpa itself. considering the above, and based on the fact that in the 3d-structures of ccpa and laci bound to their respective operators the same residues are involved in the interaction of tf with dna  <cit> , the degeneracy of the ccpa operator motif indicates it should act at relatively higher concentrations with respect to laci and other relatives. concomitantly, variable regulation of ccpa expression would represent a way to control the differential binding of ccpa to cres  <cit> .

'local' versus 'global' regulation
the identified ccpa operator motif  of l. plantarum is very similar to the consensus cre that was initially defined for b. subtilis on basis of a site-directed mutagenesis study  <cit>  and later refined on basis of the experimental identification of additional cres  <cit>  . remarkably, the dna-binding domain of ccpa on the protein level is considerably more conserved compared to that of the other laci-family tfs , whereas in contrast, the operator motif is the most degenerate. both facts reflect and emphasize the 'global' role of ccpa. we observed that the ccpa regulon that was defined on basis of a genome wide search with the specific operator motif was relatively small. the same observation was made by  <cit>  when the genome of b. subtilis was searched for potential cres for the first time. the authors concluded that this related to the lack of degeneracy in the search motif and they proved experimentally that this was indeed the case.

it is generally assumed that transcription and translation are connected processes in bacteria  <cit>  and as a consequence proteins should be produced in the physical vicinity of where they are encoded. a major implication of an intended local role of a tf would then be that the number of tf molecules necessary to effectively control expression can be minimized in case the affinity for the operator is relatively high . as mentioned in the previous section, all but one of the predicted operators indeed show a relatively high degree of conservation over different, sometimes even distantly related, species. a low tf concentration will keep in check non-local interactions as the tf will be virtually absent in the rest of the cell and, as a result, even operators that are very similar will not be affected. in fact, it was shown for carbohydrate utilization by lactobacillus acidophilus that induction of catabolic operons is highly specific for distinct sugars  <cit> . vice versa, a higher tf concentration, like anticipated for ccpa  <cit> , would relax the sensitivity towards the composition of the operator and thus enable binding to sites for which the tf has less affinity. however, transcript levels that are observed in l. plantarum under different growth conditions are not completely conclusive . nevertheless, based on the observed transcript levels one should expect that lp_ <dig> , lp_ <dig> , lp_ <dig>  lp_ <dig>  lp_ <dig> , ccpb and ccpa in principle could regulate multiple and also distant operons.

regulon boundaries and induced response
searching the genome of l. plantarum with the identified specific operator motifs yielded a list of potential binding-sites for every laci-family tf. to avoid many false predictions, we have used two conservative criteria to reduce the list of putative tf-specific binding sites. they related to the position of the site with respect to the translation start, as there is experimental data showing certain boundaries for that distance  <cit> , and to a maximum number of  <dig> deviating nucleotides. the genes/operons preceded by the putative binding sites thus should constitute putative minimal regulons. in principle, more degenerate motifs should lead to a longer list of compliant sites, as was indeed observed. this observation, which was earlier made by others  <cit> , reveals a key point in regulon predictions based on operator motifs, namely motif degeneracy complicates a straightforward decision about the authenticity of the recovered sites. moreover, as described in the above sections, binding will by necessity be influenced by tf concentration . therefore, experimental data on gene expression and tf concentration  will be essential to refine the predictions. at the same time, in most cases, a proper interpretation of experimental transcription data will require motif and regulon predictions because of the fact that the activity of many tfs is intertwined and the number of conditions tested or testable too limited to untwine these. although the extrapolation of the predictions to experimental data is non-trivial, several of the predicted associations could be confirmed on basis of data obtained in l. plantarum and related species . moreover, a comparison of the predicted regulons depicted in figure  <dig> with the environmental signals that are expected to govern the specific laci-family tf activities  shows that the recovered connection make perfect biological sense. this finding strongly supports the assertion that the predictions provide a valid coupling between the laci-family tfs and functionalities encoded by the putative regulons.

CONCLUSIONS
we have formulated a sequence-based approach that enables the identification of tf-specific binding motifs. one of the major advantages of the approach is that it is generic and thus, in principle, can be applied to any tf family without prior knowledge of the actual composition of the binding motif. in fact, we are in the process of performing similar analyses for various tf-families, including two component systems, and the preliminary results confirm the assertion. the method appears perfectly suited to identify binding sites on the genome connected to local regulators in contrast to current automated procedures that yield mostly sites connected to global regulators.

the presented data substantiate the successful identification of specific operator motifs related to the laci-family tfs in the model organism l. plantarum. the recovered motifs differ in at least one position but at the same time their similarity is considerable. as the composition of the operator motif is tightly related to the affinity of the tf for the dna this finding implicates that some of the laci-family tfs could potentially bind to the operators of another. in fact, the observed competition in b. subtilis tf knock outs, between ccpa and ccpb in the repression of the gnt and xyl operon  <cit> , exemplifies this phenomenon. simultaneously, higher tf  concentration  will result in regulation at degenerate sites  , a conclusion that correlates well with the mechanism of control of tf-activity itself as this involves a change in affinity of the tf for the operator upon induction  <cit> . an important corollary is that regulons, and especially those related to global regulators, will vary in size depending on the environmental conditions.

finally, potential binding sites can be identified based on the operator motif predictions and from those the functionalities that are regulated in response to a given stimulus can be reconstructed. in principle, the coupling of putative regulons with potential tf inducers thus provides insight in the prioritization of the functionalities within a certain organism. nevertheless, our data on laci-family tfs in l. plantarum makes perfectly clear that in order to arrive at a complete reconstruction of the encoded transcriptional response to environmental stimuli, experimental data on transcription as well as tf and inducer concentration under different environmental conditions is adamant.
