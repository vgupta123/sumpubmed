BACKGROUND
malignant melanoma is one of the fastest rising cancers in the us population and its yearly incidence is estimated at  <dig>   <cit> . if it is diagnosed early and is restricted to the epidermis, surgical resection can yield high cure rates. however, once the melanoma invades through the basement membrane into the dermis, surgical resection is less successful and there is no effective radio/chemotherapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.

vitamin a  is an essential nutrient that is required for night vision, reproduction, embryogenesis and differentiation  <cit> . retinol is metabolized by cells into a number of compounds, the most biologically active being all-trans-retinoic acid . the biological changes induced by ra are mediated by binding and activation of nuclear receptors  <cit> . there are three subtypes of retinoic acid receptors ; rar-α, β and γ, which bind ra. another vitamin a metabolite, 9-cis ra, also binds these receptors but in addition serves as the ligand for closely related nuclear receptors, the retinoid × receptors   <cit> . analogous to the rars, there are three rxr subtypes, α, β and γ  <cit> . rxrs form heterodimers with the rars as well as with several other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor   <cit> , vitamin d <dig>  <cit>  and thyroid hormone receptors  <cit> . the rxr:rar heterodimer appears to be the physiologically relevant dimer for stimulating target gene expression  <cit> . this receptor heterodimer binds to a dna element in the 5' flanking region of target genes and usually consists of a direct repeat of the sequence 5'-gtca-3' separated by  <dig> bp  <cit> . these receptors are also regulated by co-repressors and co-activators. several of the co-activators contain histone acetyltransferase activity, while co-repressor complexes contain histone deacetylase activity, suggesting that localized chromatin remodeling modulates receptor activity  <cit> .

ra inhibits the proliferation and stimulates the differentiation of many different tumor cell lines, including murine and human melanoma cells  <cit> . we have previously used b <dig> mouse melanoma as a model for our retinoid studies. this cell line is very responsive to the growth inhibitory and pro-differentiating effects of retinoic acid  <cit> . the b <dig> cell line also has major deletions in the p16ink4a and p19qrfgenes with consequent loss of expression of these proteins, but it lacks an activating mutation in the braf gene  <cit> . loss of p16ink4a and p19orf contributes to melanomagenesis by overcoming senescence  <cit> . in addition, activating braf mutations have been found in up to 60% of sporadic human melanomas  <cit> . we have found that our strain of b <dig> melanoma has an activating n-ras mutation . thus b <dig> cells have a number of the genetic/protein changes found in human melanoma cell lines and clinical melanoma specimens.

melan-a cells are nonmalignant mouse melanocytes derived from c57bl/ <dig> mice  that have been partially immortalized. they have diploid chromosomes and do not form tumors in syngeneic or athymic mice  <cit> . therefore melan-a cells serve as a good model to compare gene expression profiles to b <dig> melanoma cells with the aim of identifying genes whose altered expression might contribute to malignancy. in the study reported here, we used dna microarrays to compare gene expression patterns between b <dig> and melan-a cells. we also used dna microarrays to identify time-dependent changes in gene expression during ra-induced growth arrest and differentiation of b <dig> melanoma cells. from these two data sets, we then performed an analysis to identify a unique gene set, whose expression was altered in b <dig> compared to melan-a and whose expression was restored toward the melan-a level in ra-treated b <dig> melanoma cells.

RESULTS
time-dependent regulation of gene expression by ra
our previous studies  <cit>  have determined the amount of time required for ra to induce significant growth arrest and differentiation of b <dig> melanoma cells to be  <dig> –  <dig> h. using dna microarrays, we profiled the series of changes in gene expression that occurred in ra-treated cells prior to and coincident with these phenotypic changes. table  <dig> shows the number of genes significantly up-regulated or down-regulated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h of ra treatment in b <dig> melanoma cells. the statistical analysis of microarrays  method  <cit>  was used to determine significance in all microarray studies reported in this communication. only  <dig> genes were differentially regulated at the  <dig> hour time point. this set includes two genes, rarβ and retinal short chain dehydrogenase  <dig> , whose expression has previously been shown to be induced by ra  <cit> . the number of ra-regulated genes increases over time, with the largest increase between the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points. the number of upregulated genes exceeds the downregulated genes at all time points except the  <dig> h time point. a few genes  were up- or down-regulated during the entire time of retinoic acid treatment, but more commonly, genes exhibited altered expression for one or two time points and then their expression returns to control levels. the identity of these ra-regulated genes can be found in additional file  <dig> 

a significance was determined by significance analysis of microarrays  with median false discovery rate of 10%, and a minimum fold change of  <dig> .

expression profiling of untreated melan-a nonmalignant mouse melanocytes vs. b <dig> mouse melanoma cells
melan-a and b <dig> cells are both derived from the c57bl/ <dig> strain of mouse. the melan-a cells are partially immortalized, but they are diploid, lack transformed cell phenotypes and do not form tumors in syngeneic mice  <cit> . a comparison of global gene expression between these two melanocyte/melanoma cell lines has not been reported. our analyses show that  <dig> genes had expression levels significantly higher in melan-a vs. b <dig> cells, i.e. their expression was downregulated in the malignant melanoma cells relative to the non-malignant cells . in addition, there were  <dig> genes whose expression levels were significantly lower in melan-a cells vs. b <dig> cells, i.e. their expression was upregulated in the malignant melanoma cells. the identity of these differentially regulated genes can be found in additional file  <dig> 

gene expression changes induced by ra treatment of b <dig> cells that mimic expression in melan-a cells: the intersecting gene set
we combined data sets from ra-treated b <dig> melanoma cells and untreated melan-a vs. b <dig> data sets in order to discover common genes that were significantly changed in both sets . there were  <dig> genes that were upregulated in melan-a compared to b <dig> cells and whose expression was upregulated by ra treatment of b <dig> cells at one or more time point. there were however a small number of genes  whose expression was downregulated in b <dig> compared to melan-a and whose expression was also decreased by ra treatment of b <dig> cells. likewise, there were  <dig> genes whose expression was downregulated in melan-a cells compared to b <dig> cells and whose expression was decreased by ra treatment of b <dig> cells. again, a small number of genes  had increased expression in b <dig> vs. melan-a and treatment of b <dig> cells with ra further enhanced their expression. overall, the majority of genes in this combined data set  were those whose expression was restored toward the melan-a  level when b <dig> melanoma cells were treated with ra for  <dig> h. three of the  <dig> genes  and riken cdna 3110001a13) were upregulated by ra at  <dig> h. the identities of these  <dig> genes, their fold changes at  <dig> h of ra treatment and their relative expression in melan-a vs. b <dig> cells are shown in additional file  <dig> 

in both the experiment comparing gene expression in ra-treated b <dig> cells to that in untreated b <dig> cells, and the experiment comparing gene expression in melan-a cells to that in b <dig> cells, significance is determined by sam with median false discovery rate of 10%, and a minimum fold change of  <dig> . table entries in bold represent genes for which treatment by ra changes the expression in b <dig> cells towards that in melan-a cells.

we determined if members of the  <dig> gene set were enriched in known biological processes listed in the gene ontology database by using the fisher exact test in ariadne genomics pathway studio. additional file  <dig> provides a list of these processes ordered by statistical significance. the five biological processes which were most significant are cell division, cell cycle, cell cycle regulation, dna replication and mitosis. in these processes, all genes were expressed higher in b <dig> than in melan-a cells. examination of members within the processes reveals gene products that are clearly involved in promoting the cell division and dna replication. for example, in the dna replication set,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes encode proteins known to function directly in dna synthesis or nucleotide metabolism . the identity of each gene within the five processes is given in additional file  <dig>  several significant biological processes  contained genes that were overexpressed in melan-a cells. these findings are consistent with the more rapid doubling of b <dig>  in contrast to melan-a cells . the total number of genes in both columns is greater than  <dig> because several genes are present in more than one process.

we confirmed the authenticity of the microarray-measured expression changes for seven genes within the  <dig> gene set by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction  . all gene expression changes except for the plat melan-a vs. b <dig> ratio were verified by these independent analyses. protein kinase c alpha , not listed here, but a member of the  <dig> gene set, has previously been verified by us using both northern and western analysis  <cit> . it is interesting to note that in most instances, the reported degree of difference in gene expression between melan-a vs. b <dig> or ra treatment at  <dig> h is greater by qrt-pcr analysis than by microarray analysis. thus the microarray technology tends to underestimate changes in gene expression between the comparison groups. this phenomenon has been previously reported by yuen et al.  <cit> .

all qrt-pcr values were significant by bonferroni-corrected  t-test with p <  <dig>  with the exception of starred  value.

clustering and pathway analysis
hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> genes over all  <dig> arrays  is shown in fig.  <dig>  we observed that the  <dig> and  <dig> hours arrays tend to cluster together, indicating that there is little overall expression difference between these two time points. however, the  <dig> hour arrays and  <dig> hour arrays considered as a single set form a tight cluster, indicating that the expression at the 4- and 10-hour time points is significantly different from later time points. the majority of the  <dig> h arrays form a single cluster, as do the majority of the arrays comparing melan-a expression to b <dig> expression. furthermore, the expression at the  <dig> h time point for these  <dig> genes is closer to the expression in melan-a cells than to any of the ra-treated cells at other time points. the arrays at  <dig> h do not form a cluster, indicating that there is much greater variation in expression at this time point than at the other time points or in the melan-a expression profile.

lastly we used pathway studio v <dig>   program to identify and illustrate molecular connections between the proteins encoded by the  <dig> gene set. this program searches through the resnet database for all known interactions between genes/proteins such as physical interaction, regulation of expression and protein modification  and expresses the result in graphical form . we calculated the statistical significance of the number of interactions, accounting for the number of known interactions in the pathway studio database. those with holm-bonferroni adjusted p <  <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  based on the most significant p-values, we identified four major "hubs" for connectivity; cell division cycle  <dig> protein , checkpoint kinase  <dig>  cdc <dig> cell division cycle 45-like  and minichromosome maintenance deficient protein  <dig> . three hubs with relatively high numbers of interactions , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a protein  and cmyc protein) also met our criteria for statistical significance but with lower p-values.

genes listed are those which have a statistically significant number of interactions according to fisher's exact test with holm-bonferroni adjusted p-value <  <dig> .

discussion
ra has the ability to induce differentiation and/or growth arrest in a variety of cancer cells  <cit> . however, the genes and pathways that mediate the biological effects of ra have not been fully elucidated. b <dig> mouse melanoma cells are very sensitive to ra treatment and respond by undergoing growth arrest and differentiation  <cit> . in this study we used mouse dna microarrays to determine the time-dependent changes in gene expression in control vs. ra-treated b <dig> mouse melanoma cells. our results show a small number of changes, mostly increases, in gene expression at early time points .

there was a major increase in the number of genes whose expression changed at  <dig> h of ra treatment and at this time point genes that were downregulated outnumbered those that were upregulated. to our knowledge, this is the first reported study of time-dependent changes in gene expression in ra-treated melanoma cells. other studies have examined time-dependent gene expression changes in human embryonal carcinoma cells  <cit> , f <dig> teratocarcinoma cells  <cit> , and mouse skin  <cit>  treated with ra. similar to our results, a much larger number of genes had altered expression at 24– <dig> h of ra treatment. comparison of the identity of ra-regulated genes in these studies with those reported here reveal some commonality of genes such as rar-β <dig>  pkcα and insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  but also a number of different gene expression changes. possible explanations for these differences are analysis of different cell types, use of different microarray platforms and different methods of statistical analysis.

in the hierarchical clustering analysis  the  <dig> and  <dig> h ra-treated b <dig> cell-gene expression changes formed a tight cluster as do the  <dig> h ra-treated b <dig> cell gene changes. however, the changes in gene expression in  <dig> h ra-treated b <dig> cells did not form a cluster. this implies more variability in gene expression around this time of ra treatment, possibly because there are dramatic changes in gene expression around this time point.

the second microarray data set is a comparison between gene expression in untreated b <dig> mouse melanoma cells and melan-a mouse melanocytes. both of these cell lines are derived from the same c57bl/ <dig> inbred mouse strain. the melan-a cells have a longer replicative life-span than primary mouse melanocytes before they enter senescence  <cit> . significant differences in expression are found in genes encoding cell cycle regulatory proteins, dna metabolism, and dna repair enzymes. there have been a number of studies comparing gene expression profiles in human melanocytes to human melanoma cell lines  <cit>  and human nevus tissue to various stages of human melanoma tumors from patients  <cit> , but very little information is available comparing expression profiles in mouse melanocytes with mouse melanoma cells. despite the species difference, a number of genes which had altered expression in human melanocytes vs. human melanoma cells, such as cdc <dig>  c-myc, dna repair enzymes and differentiation/embryonic markers, were found to be altered in the expression profiles between melan-a and b <dig> cells. our findings suggest that b <dig> melanoma cells serve as a valid model for studying human melanoma

we sought to determine whether there were common genes between the microarray data set generated from ra treatment of b <dig> melanoma cells and the microarray data set comparing the gene expression of melan-a to b <dig> cells. we found that there were  <dig> genes in common between these two data sets. within this group, the large majority,  <dig> genes,  had their expression altered by ra treatment of b <dig> melanoma cells toward the levels found in melan-a cells. in general, ra treatment decreases the expression of genes involved in cell division/cell cycle, dna replication and repair, and transcription regulation. it also decreases expression of the genes involved in dna recombination and protein folding. in contrast, ra increases the expression of genes that regulate cell-cell signaling, cell adhesion and cell differentiation and development. considering that ra inhibits cell replication and stimulates differentiation, these ra-induced changes in gene expression reflect the reprogramming of the b <dig> cells toward the melan-a  phenotype. the reversion is not complete since some genes whose expression is decreased in b <dig> melanoma cells relative to melan-a cells  are not regulated by ra. finally, we note that only three genes within the  <dig> gene set were differentially regulated by ra at  <dig> h.  dhrs <dig>  a member of sdr family, encodes an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of all trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol in the presence of nadph and is highly expressed in the retina  <cit> .  mouse camk2nl mrna is induced  <dig>  fold by ra at  <dig> h and is downregulated  <dig>  fold in b <dig> relative to melan-a cells. this protein exhibits strong similarity  to the human camkiinα which has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression in s phase in human colon adenocarcinoma cells  <cit> .  although riken cdna 3110001a <dig> had significant homology to human, chimp, macaque and rat cdnas , no function has been ascribed to its predicted protein.

to determine the pathway that mediate the effect of ra inhibition of cell proliferation and stimulation of differentiation, we used pathway studio v <dig>  software to discover relationships between the proteins encoded by the  <dig> gene set. we found  <dig> genes  whose encoded proteins have known connections either through physical interaction, regulation of gene expression or protein modification . these interactions clustered around four major "hub" proteins: cdc <dig>  chek <dig>  cdc45l and mcm <dig>  we note that even though these four proteins had small numbers of partners, by using the fisher exact test we found that these hubs were statistically enriched for molecular interactions. in addition, three other proteins p <dig>  p <dig> and cmyc appear to be important since they have large numbers of known interactions. zhang and rosdahl  <cit>  found that ra treatment of human melanoma cells increased the expression of p <dig>  while vertuani et al.  <cit>  observed p <dig> to be increased in ra-treated human uveal melanoma cells. likewise there are numerous reports that ra alters the expression of p21waf-1/cip- <dig> in a variety of tumor cells  <cit> . gompel  <cit>  found that ra decreases the expression and activity of cdk <dig>  and there are a variety of studies showing that ra inhibits the expression of c-myc  <cit> . in contrast, no evidence has been published that ra regulates chek <dig> gene expression. chek <dig> is involved in stopping cells from progressing through the cell cycle while dna damage is repaired. increased expression of this gene is frequently associated with resistance to chemotherapy  <cit> . a search of the pubmed database revealed no publications linking retinoic acid to the regulation of mcm <dig> or cdc45l. further analysis of the time-dependent changes in ra-induced gene expression is needed to define the sequence of pathways that lead to rna expression levels found in the  <dig> gene set.

CONCLUSIONS
our study has shown that ra regulates the expression of  <dig> % of the total known mouse genes in b <dig> mouse melanoma cells over the course of  <dig> h of treatment. alteration of the expression of these genes is associated with ra-induced growth arrest and differentiation of b <dig> mouse melanoma cells. we also found that ~ <dig> % of the total known mouse genes were differentially expressed in melan-a mouse melanocytes vs. b <dig> mouse melanoma cells. in comparing these two data sets, we found  <dig> common genes. within this set,  <dig> genes in b <dig> melanoma cells had their rna expression "normalized" toward the melan-a level by treatment with ra. pathway analysis of the proteins encoded by this  <dig> data set revealed that 32% are involved in common interactions. the major hubs of connectivity are centered around cdc <dig>  chek <dig>  cdc45l and mcm <dig>  it is likely that these four genes and their encoded proteins play a major role in ra-induced growth arrest and differentiation of b <dig> mouse melanoma cells.
