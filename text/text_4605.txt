BACKGROUND
brucellae are gram-negative, facultative, intracellular bacteria that can infect many species of animals and man. six species were classically recognized within the genus brucella: b. abortus, b. melitensis, b. suis, b. ovis, b. canis, and b. neotomae  <cit> . this classification is mainly based on differences in pathogenicity, host preference, and phenotypic characteristics  <cit> . three additional species have been recently included in the genus brucella, i.e. b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis isolated from marine mammals, with cetaceans  and pinnipeds  as preferred hosts respectively  <cit> , and b. microti isolated from the common vole  <cit> . from a phenotypic point of view, b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis can be distinguished by their growth requirement for co <dig> and their oxidative metabolism  <cit> .

the phylogenetic significance of this separation is supported by molecular analyses. at the molecular level, evidence for two distinct marine mammal brucella subpopulations subsequently given species rank and designated b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis has been initially provided by study of dna polymorphism at the porin-encoding omp <dig> locus  <cit> . this was further confirmed by an infrequent restriction site-pcr  method, reflecting the higher number of is <dig> elements in the genome of marine mammal isolates compared to terrestrial mammal brucella species  <cit> . irs-pcr revealed six specific dna fragments useful for the detection and identification of marine mammal brucella isolates and the presence of a putative genomic island only in seal isolates except for hooded seal isolates  <cit> . interestingly to date three human cases, one from new zealand and two from peru, with brucella infections presumably of marine origin, have been described according to the specific molecular markers cited above, and may point towards a zoonotic potential of these marine mammal brucella species  <cit> . one human case with laboratory acquired infection has also been reported  <cit> .

in the past few years, polymorphic tandem repeat loci have been identified by analysing published genome sequences of b. melitensis  <dig> m, b. suis  <dig>  and b. abortus 9â€“ <dig>  <cit> . hundreds of brucella strains have been typed to allow the development of an assay, called mlva- <dig> assay   <cit> . the sixteen loci have been grouped in  <dig> panels, called panel  <dig> , panel 2a  and panel 2b   <cit> . panel  <dig> has shown to be useful for species identification. panel 2a and panel 2b increased the discriminatory power. panel 2b was selected to contain the more highly variable markers, which is why this panel is often given a lower weight in clustering analysis  <cit> . three of the five octamers in panel 2b have been initially evaluated by bricker et al.  <cit> . the mlva- <dig> assay provides a clustering of strains that is in accordance with the currently recognized brucella species and biovars isolated from terrestrial mammals.

the aim of this study was to evaluate the mlva- <dig> assay for the classification of marine mammal brucella isolates, using  <dig> marine mammal brucella strains obtained from  <dig> animals representing a wide range of marine mammal species from different european geographic origins . this study also included the strain, presumably of marine origin, isolated from a patient in new zealand  <cit> . a tentative overview of the global brucella population structure was produced by comparison with published typing data.

RESULTS
all strains could be typed at all loci, with few exceptions for panel 2b loci. at the loci bruce <dig>  bruce <dig> and bruce <dig>  multiple bands were observed in the pcr products of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively. this may suggest that in some occasions multiple alleles are present in the dna preparation. besides, two strains were negative in pcr either for bruce <dig> or bruce <dig>  in  <dig> animals, strains were initially isolated from different organs, contributing  <dig> extra strains. in sixteen among these animals, more than one genotype was observed . in most cases, these genotypes were also observed in at least one other animal. in five cases, at least one of the genotypes was unique in the present collection, suggesting that the presence of multiple genotypes could be the result of a mutation event that occurred in the course of infection. three of these new genotypes were the result of one repeat unit changes at a single locus. the other two were a  <dig> repeat units change in bruce <dig> and a four repeat units change in bruce <dig>  these observations suggest that occasionally the most highly mutable loci may vary in the course of infection. they also do not exclude the possibility that animals carrying multiple variants may have been infected by multiple strains present within the community.

the  <dig> investigated marine mammal brucella isolates which originated from  <dig> animals and one patient clustered in  <dig> different genotypes using the complete mlva- <dig> assay. one representative for each genotype and animal was used for analysis, totalling  <dig> strains . three main groups were identified, the b. ceti group, the b. pinnipedialis group and a third group comprising the human isolate from new zealand. the  <dig> representative genotypes were compared with the  <dig> terrestrial mammal brucella reference strains and published data . the  <dig> clusters were clearly separated from all the terrestrial mammal isolates.

the cetacean group composed of  <dig> strains presenting  <dig> genotypes   could be separated into three major subclusters. the first two subclusters a <dig> and a <dig>  from genotype  <dig> to  <dig> were only composed of dolphin isolates and one minke whale isolate ,  <dig> from atlantic white sided dolphins ,  <dig> from bottlenose dolphins  and  <dig> from a common dolphin ). these two subclusters correspond to sequence type st <dig>  <cit> , mlva panel  <dig> genotype  <dig>  and  <dig> , and together correspond to cluster a in  <cit>  . the third subcluster, from genotype  <dig> to  <dig> corresponds to mlst sequence type  <dig>  mlva- <dig> panel  <dig> genotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and is cluster b in  <cit>  . this subcluster was composed of  <dig> strains. sixty-four were obtained from porpoises,  <dig> from  <dig> species of dolphins , one from a white-beaked dolphin , one from a bottlenose dolphin , one from a common dolphin , and one from a minke whale  isolated in norway in  <dig>  <cit>  . an exception was the bmar <dig> , with the genotype  <dig>  isolated in scotland from a harbour  seal  and which belongs to the b. ceti group . this is, however, in agreement with previous observations, either phenotypic  <cit>  or molecular, including mlva typing  <cit> . this particular strain carries the two specific irs-pcr fragments  of the b. ceti strains  <cit> , and the pcr-rflp pattern of the omp <dig> genes is similar to that of brucella strains isolated from porpoises  <cit> .

the  <dig> representative b. pinnipedialis strains presented  <dig> different genotypes   corresponding to cluster c in  <cit> . this group of isolates could similarly be further divided in three major subclusters. the first subcluster  was composed of several seal isolates ) and the isolate from a european sea otter . it corresponds to mlst sequence type  <dig>  mlva panel  <dig> genotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and cluster c <dig> in  <cit> . the second subcluster  corresponds to mlst sequence type  <dig>  mlva panel  <dig> genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> and is cluster c <dig> in  <cit> . interestingly, the hooded seal isolates  were exclusively clustered in  <dig> closely related genotypes, forming the third subcluster of the pinniped isolates  called c <dig> in  <cit> . most of the hooded seal isolates analysed in this study were isolated in norway in  <dig>  <cit>  and there were also  <dig> hooded seal isolates from scotland that clustered with the norwegian isolates. one of the  <dig> strains of the b. pinnipedialis group was obtained from a cetacean. this strain , identified as bmar <dig> with the genotype <dig> in figure  <dig>  was isolated from a minke whale in scotland in  <dig>  this strain was also demonstrated as a b. pinnipedialis strain by other molecular markers, as described by maquart et al.  <cit>  and groussaud et al.  <cit> .

the human isolate 02/ <dig>  from new zealand ), clearly separates from the clusters described above but fits in an intermediate position within the marine mammal groups of isolates in agreement with previous mlst analyses  <cit> . figure  <dig> suggests a position closer to the b. ceti group in agreement with the phenotypic behaviour  <cit> , but the typing of more strains from pacific waters  <cit>  will be needed in order to achieve a more conclusive cluster analysis.

owing to the inclusion of  <dig> representative strains in duplicate, the results described above could be compared to those recently described by groussaud et al. who studied  <dig> marine mammal isolates by multilocus sequence typing, multilocus sequence analysis  and mlva. duplicate typing was useful since groussaud et al. used a partially different set of  <dig> vntrs  <cit>  , one from panel 2a  and the whole panel 2b).

discussion
since  <dig>  marine mammal brucella strains have been isolated and characterized, both phenotypically and by means of different molecular typing methods. this led to the division of the marine mammal brucella strains in  <dig> species i.e. b. ceti on one side and b. pinnipedialis on the other side defined by oxidative metabolism patterns and co <dig> requirement for growth, and a number of subclusters defined by complementary molecular analysis methods.

this mlva- <dig> study is, to date, the most important one in terms of number of strains analysed and number of animal species from which these strains have been isolated. these strains were isolated from animals stranded, caught or killed for scientific purposes in the waters surrounding europe, from the barents sea, above the arctic circle to the atlantic coast of spain. for the  <dig> strains analysed, using the mlva- <dig> assay,  <dig> genotypes were resolved and seven clusters were identified,  two clusters almost exclusively composed of dolphin isolates,  the predominantly porpoise cluster of strains ,  two main seal species clusters,  the hooded seal cluster, and  the human isolate. the last cluster might correspond to pacific ocean isolates  <cit> , which are underrepresented in the present collection. the hooded seal cluster of strains was composed of strains from scotland and norway. the low level of genetic diversity between the hooded seal isolates from scotland and from norway could indicate that all the investigated hooded seals originated from the same population of animals. the population that was sampled between svalbard and greenland have their breeding area in the pack ice north of jan mayen , but except for the few weeks on ice during birth, mating and moulting, the hooded seal is a typical pelagic and a migratory species with a huge geographical range  <cit> . it is thus likely that the hooded seals stranded in scotland were originally from this area rather than from the more western bound populations of hooded seals that breed in the davis strait and at the east coast of canada.

groussaud et al.  <cit>  analysed the diversity of marine mammal isolates by mlva using another selection of vntrs, including all  <dig> loci defining the hoof-prints mlva assay described by bricker et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> additional loci characterised by le flÃ¨che et al.  <cit>  and whatmore et al.  <cit> . this panel of  <dig> vntr loci corresponded to a 21-locus mlva scheme sharing  <dig> loci with mlva- <dig> and also provides a high degree of diversity. in this previous study, multilocus sequence types  were determined, allowing the clustering of marine mammal isolates in five groups labelled st <dig> to st <dig>  the closely related st <dig> and st <dig> were composed of the pinniped isolates, forming the cluster c. the hooded seal isolates define subcluster c <dig>  st <dig> was exclusively composed of dolphin isolates and formed the cluster a. the other cetacean isolates all clustered in the cluster b  and consisted of strains isolated from porpoises and dolphins. st <dig> was represented by only one isolate from an aborted bottlenose dolphin foetus originating from the western coast of the united states   <cit> . our results are thus in excellent accordance with those published by groussaud et al.  <cit>  showing that the previously identified population structure of marine mammal brucella strains is not significantly modified by the inclusion of a large number of strains from european waters. mlva- <dig> results are also in accordance with the recently reported genomic structures of  <dig> marine mammal brucella isolates for which three subgroups were identified  <cit> . in that study, one separate group was identified for the b. pinnipedialis strains, another subgroup included dolphin isolates and a third subgroup comprised dolphin and porpoise isolates. the only hooded seal isolate analysed in that study clustered in the b. pinnipedialis group but revealed a separate pattern with a  <dig> kb missing fragment, specific for this group and relevant for a distinct genetic background  <cit> .

mlva- <dig> classification in the present report revealed some exceptions like the m490/95/ <dig> strain, isolated from a common seal, which was clustered in the b. ceti group of strains. this exception suggests that transmission from cetaceans to pinnipeds may occur. although the currently recognized terrestrial mammal brucella species also have a preferred host, they can be isolated from different hosts in regions where brucellosis is endemic, e.g. b. melitensis which has been isolated from cattle in the southern part of france  <cit> .

the human isolate from new zealand formed a separate seventh mlva- <dig> cluster. whatmore et al.  <cit>  have shown that the f5/ <dig> strain, isolated from an aborted bottlenose dolphin fetus from the western coast of the united states  shared the same mlst genotype . interestingly, at the omp <dig> level both strains were identical and also identical to isolates from the north pacific minke whales. in all these strains the porin omp <dig> genes were different from those from marine mammal strains isolated on european coasts  <cit> . briefly, the omp <dig> genes of these isolates from the pacific share common features with both marine mammal  and terrestrial mammal strains  <cit> . another interesting observation is that all the pacific isolates investigated so far  carry fragment i identified by irs-pcr which is part of a putative genomic island specific for b. pinnipedialis  <cit> . since these cetacean isolates are quite distinct from european marine mammal isolates there might be a third marine mammal brucella species or subspecies found in pacific waters. owing to the simplicity of mlva- <dig> typing, and in particular of panel  <dig> which can be typed on regular agarose gels and already provides a high informativity in classifying marine mammal strains , more typing information on pacific ocean strains  will likely be made available in a near future. the brucella <dig> genotyping database available at http://mlva.u-psud.fr/ and based upon the data provided in additional file  <dig> can be used for this purpose. figure  <dig> shows the global population structure of the nine species currently constituting the brucella genus, as can be revealed by mlva- <dig> typing using this dataset .

CONCLUSIONS
mlva- <dig> proved to be useful for molecular classification of a high number of marine mammal brucella strains and allows the typing of large populations, while providing a clustering in agreement with all previously reported methods, together with a much higher discriminatory power. from the clustering achieved, a few representative strains can be selected for whole genome sequencing.
