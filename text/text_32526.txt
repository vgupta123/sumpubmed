BACKGROUND
the protozoan flagellate tritrichomonas foetus belongs to the phylum parabasalia, which includes the human parasite; trichomonas vaginalis
 <cit> 
. originally described as a nasal and gastrointestinal commensal of pigs, t. foetus infects the urogenital tract of cattle resulting in disease known as trichomoniasis . transmission of the disease to female cows occurs during coitus with infected bulls, which can result in abortion of the foetus . recently, t. foetus has been identified as the etiological agent of gastrointestinal infection of domestic cats, where infection results in chronic large bowel diarrhoea . the disease in both hosts is very difficult to treat. bovine trichomoniasis is currently untreatable and the only control measure available to farmers is to cull infected bulls or remove them from the breeding herd. although treatment options for feline trichomoniasis do exist, they are becoming increasingly ineffective due to evolving parasite drug resistance and issues associated with host drug toxicity .

tritrichomonas foetus represents an intriguing model to study host-parasite interactions. there has been much conjecture as to the origins of the bovine and feline isolates. in particular, are they different parasites or merely closely related genotypes? given that both infections are caused by t. foetus, it is not surprising that historically they have been assumed to be the same parasite. the adaptation of parasites to different hosts is nothing new, however, the extreme host-organ tropism of the bovine isolate  and feline isolate  suggest that they are distinct genotypes that, over the course of their respective evolutions, have preferentially adapted to their respective host/niche  <cit> . further evidence as to their distinctiveness  has been demonstrated experimentally when the bovine genotype is introduced into the feline intestinal tract, and vice versa. although both genotypes are capable of establishing infection in their non-typical host, the pathology is markedly less than on their preferred hosts  <cit> . successful delineation of the genotypes would enable a more precise estimation of trichomonas species richness and permit a better epidemiological understanding of the pathological basis of these diseases. currently, artificial insemination and culling of infected animals ensures that a low infection level is maintained in intensively-managed cattle industries  <cit> . infections, however, are still prevalent in extensive farming systems  <cit> . moreover, current evaluation of the infection in domestic cats indicated a high prevalence, especially in young  pedigree catteries  <cit> .

although it has recently been established that the porcine t. foetus  and the bovine t. foetus are synonymous  <cit> , the relationship between the bovine and feline t. foetus is proving harder to elucidate. evidence of the limited genetic distinctness between the bovine and the feline isolates is apparent when highly conserved species-level nucleotide sequences for the internal transcribed spacer  <dig>  and elongation factor  <dig> alpha  of the two genotypes are compared  <cit> . as the original diagnostic marker, a single nucleotide polymorphism in its <dig> between the bovine and feline t. foetus amounts to a sequence difference of only  <dig> %  <cit> . more recent studies demonstrated genetic difference between the two genotypes by analysing the cysteine protease multigene family  <cit> . this family of genes is known to play a key role in parasite virulence . it has been suggested, however, that these minor sequence differences between genotypes may merely represent intraspecific variation and not have any significant phenotypic consequences  <cit> . nevertheless, ambiguity arises when single gene assays are used in an attempt to compare very closely related genotypes with broad host ranges, such as the bovine and feline t. foetus.

there is the need for a more comprehensive cell-wide approach to enable further elucidation of the relationship between the bovine and feline t. foetus genotypes. this is further confounded by a lack of t. foetus genome data which has undoubtedly hindered our understanding of host-switching and search for novel drug targets in these parasites. therefore, in the absence of a genome, we have used rna-seq to sequence the transcriptome of bovine and feline t. foetus genotypes in an attempt to provide a blueprint of functional capacity of each of the host/niche adapted t. foetus genotypes. this study represents the first cell-wide comparative analysis of t. foetus genotypes, enabling us to determine the extent to which differences between host/niche is reflected in their transcriptomes. in addition to investigating t. foetus host-specific biological and virulence mechanisms, we utilised our transcriptomic libraries to explore the usefulness of in silico techniques for the identification of potential parasite drug targets, taking into account their expanded host-range.

RESULTS
transcriptome
illumina sequencing and transcriptome assembly
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> 100 bp paired-end illumina reads were obtained following the sequencing of total rna isolated from bovine and feline tritrichomonas foetus isolates, respectively. assessment of read quality by fastqc revealed good quality reads . raw reads were mapped onto a small, previously published bovine t. foetus est library and visually assessed to confirm a non-biased and even distribution of sequenced reads. paired-end sequencing reads from each genotype were assembled using trinity  <cit>  into two transcriptomes consisting of  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs representing the bovine and feline genotypes respectively . a mean contig length of  <dig>  bp was obtained in the bovine t. foetus transcriptome, with minimum and maximum contig lengths of 201 bp and  <dig>  bp respectively. the feline t. foetus transcriptome had a mean contig length of  <dig>  bp with a minimum length of 201 bp and a maximum of  <dig>  bp in length.table  <dig>

ortholog identification
homologous transcript pairs between the bovine and the feline genotypes were identified using a reciprocal blast. this method identified  <dig>  pairs of homologous transcripts which were further subjected to a blastx search against the swissport database  to remove putative paralogous genes  <cit> . orthologous pairs of coding regions were defined by comparing corresponding sequence pairs originating from each genotype and only those found to have identical top-hit in the blastx results were selected. a total of  <dig>  transcript pairs were selected using this method and were thus considered strong orthologs of the bovine and feline t. foetus .figure  <dig>

a local version of the full-lengther next  algorithm  <cit>  was implemented to identify putative coding regions in the orthologs using the invertebrate database, as this resulted in superior protein annotation results. approximately  <dig>  transcripts were protein annotated by the algorithm, of which,  <dig>  pairs of ortholog pairs were found to be full length transcripts . the coding regions of the  <dig>  ortholog pairs were isolated using bash scripting.

functional annotation and highly transcribed genes
functional annotation at the blastx and gene ontology level of the assembled transcriptomes were carried out using a combination of locally implemented blastx searches and blast2go  <cit> . whole transcriptome annotations and annotations of only orthologs revealed a similar distribution of functional categories between the bovine and feline genotypes . the difference in size of the two assembled transcriptomes can account for the slight variation in the number of transcripts obtained per functional category. the absence of four functional categories from the feline genotype that were identified in the bovine genotype is solely a limitation of the threshold of reported sequences set for presenting go categories.

to identify the top  <dig> transcribed genes from each transcriptome, raw sequencing reads were mapped back onto the assembled transcriptome of each genotype and counts were normalized to rpkm . the top  <dig> transcripts with the highest rpkm values were selected from the bovine and feline transcriptomes. the top  <dig> rkpm values for the bovine genotype ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , whereas the rpkm range for the top  <dig> transcribed genes in the feline transcriptome was from  <dig>  to  <dig> . blast annotations obtained previously were used to extract the putative functions of the top  <dig> bovine and feline transcripts. within this list,  <dig> feline transcripts and  <dig> bovine transcripts were identified as ortholog genes , however, only  <dig> were orthologs pairs common to both genotypes . the common ortholog genes included mainly genes involved in metabolic activity, oxygen scavenging and regulation of homeostasis; all of which are expected in trichomonads. the remaining  <dig> and  <dig> non-ortholog, but highly-expressed transcripts from the bovine and feline genotypes were annotated as ribosomal-related proteins .figure  <dig>

utr analysis
un-translated regions  of mrna flank either end of the coding region and contain regulatory elements that dictate translation of genes . only the  <dig>  full-length ortholog transcripts were used to compare the utr lengths and regulatory content of the two t. foetus genotypes. the average length of 5′utrs were  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides  for the bovine and feline genotypes, respectively. the longest bovine and feline 5′utrs were  <dig>  nt and  <dig>  nt in length. the  <dig> – 25 nt length range contained approximately 67% of 5′utrs from both genotypes . longer 5′utrs  were more prominent in the feline genotype with an additional nine feline sequences within this length category compared to that of the bovine genotype. length analysis of 3′utrs revealed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of bovine and feline sequences, respectively, were found within the  <dig> – 200 nt length range. on average, 3′utrs were longer than 5′utrs with the mean length amounting to  <dig>  nt for the bovine t. foetus and 70 nt for the feline genotype. the maximum length of 3′utrs were, however, shorter than the longest 5′utr with the lengths reaching to  <dig>  nt and  <dig>  nt for the bovine and feline genotypes, respectively.figure  <dig>

to identify any patterns of correlation between the 3′utr and 5′utr length and the normalized expression count , the  <dig>  orthologs were plotted in a scatter plot . a non-linear model of regression was used to calculate a weighted r <dig> which takes into account the uneven variance between points across the graph, ensuring that all points contributed equally. in general, r2 <  <dig> , indicated no correlation between the transcript expression and the length of the utrs.figure  <dig>

using the utrscan algorithm  <cit>  to search the utrsite database  <cit>  for known utr regulatory motifs, a list of putative motifs were obtained for the two t. foetus genotypes. overall,  <dig> different motifs were annotated in the utr regions of  <dig>  full-length orthologs between the two genotypes .

all motif patterns in the utrs were common to both genotypes except for an alcohol dehydrogenase element associated with the 3′utr of the feline genotype  . the most common motif in both genotypes was annotated to the au-rich class- <dig> element . this amounted to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the number of unique hits in the bovine and feline genotypes, respectively. polyadenylation signals  were found in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the bovine and feline unique hits obtained.figure  <dig>

discovery of new proteases and protease inhibitors
being a strict extracellular parasite, the ability of t. foetus parasites to attach to host cells is an essential prerequisite for the initiation and maintenance of infection  <cit> . during infection, the bovine host mounts a humoral defence against t. foetus, however, it is not necessarily sufficient to clear the infection  <cit> . the secretion of cysteine proteases  is thought to be an important facet of t. foetus virulence. cps have been demonstrated to cleave and inactivate host protective antibodies, enabling the parasite to remain within the host  <cit> . to date, there have been  <dig> cps identified in the bovine genotype, while only  <dig> cps have been identified within the feline genotype  <cit> . blast annotation identified a total of  <dig> and  <dig> hits to known proteases in the bovine and feline t. foetus transcriptomes, respectively. both transcriptomes were also found to contain  <dig> hits for protease inhibitors. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cps with a corresponding  <dig> and  <dig> cp inhibitors were identified as belonging to the bovine and feline t. foetus respectively.

the full list of proteases was used in a search against the merops peptidase database enabling the further identification of true proteases  <cit> . of the initial list obtained through ncbi blast, only  <dig> and  <dig> bovine and feline t. foetus transcripts received hits from the merops database. of these hits,  <dig> bovine transcripts produced hits to a single protease active site, compared to  <dig> feline transcripts with unique hits. some sequences obtained hits to multiple active site domains. a total number of  <dig> bovine and  <dig> feline active sites were obtained when the results were collapsed to show only unique types of protease active sites per transcript . the largest group detected was the cysteine proteases active site architecture, amounting to  <dig> % in bovine t. foetus and 50% in feline t. foetus of the total hits obtained. no hits were obtained for glutamic or asparagine proteases in either parasite transcriptomes. similarly, the same pipeline carried out on trichomonas vaginalis coding genes based on the draft genome produced  <dig> annotated “protease/peptidase/proteinase” related genes  <cit> . this comparably corresponded to  <dig> confirmed putative proteases possessing cysteine-specific active sites in t. vaginalis found in the merops database .table  <dig> 
frequency of protease active site present within the bovine and feline transcriptome




two protease active sites were unique to either one of the parasite genotypes. in the bovine t. foetus, transcript bc12_comp23753_c0_seq <dig> produced a hit to the serine active site s <dig> of the pc clan  which was not present in the feline t. foetus protease list. conversely, the feline transcript g10_comp5459_c0_seq <dig> produced a unique hit to the metalloprotease active site m20x of the mh clan  which was unmatched in the bovine t. foetus protease list.

raw reads were mapped back onto the putative protease and counts were normalized using rpkm revealing  <dig> bovine and  <dig> feline t. foetus proteases being expressed at an rpkm of  <dig> or greater. this rpkm threshold was chosen to signify high expression of proteases. of the highly expressed proteases,  <dig> % of bovine and  <dig> % of feline transcripts contained cp active sites, with the merops c01a protease family represented in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of bovine and feline highly expressed cps, respectively . the putative t. foetus cp sequences were aligned to previously published cp sequences to identify known cps within our list  <cit> . of the  <dig> bovine and  <dig> feline published cp sequences,  <dig> known bovine cps were among the highly expressed proteases , whereas cp <dig> and cp <dig> were the only known feline cps with an rpkm above  <dig> in the feline transcriptome. interestingly, while cp <dig> was the most transcribed protease in the bovine genotype, cp <dig> was found to be highly transcribed in the feline genotype.table  <dig>

of the  <dig> inhibitors initially found in the blastx transcriptome annotation,  <dig> feline t. foetus transcripts obtained a positive hit to an inhibitor active site from the merops database, compared to only  <dig> bovine t. foetus transcripts with known inhibitor active site hits. using blastn for pairwise alignments of the bovine and feline inhibitor sequences, all bovine sequences align to a feline sequence with approx. 99% identity . one putative feline inhibitor sequence  did not align to any bovine sequences and produced a match to the merops i <dig> protease family .table  <dig>

analysis of sequence divergence
pairwise codon-alignments of the  <dig>  full-length ortholog transcripts shared between the bovine and feline t. foetus, revealed that only  <dig>  transcript pairs  were sufficiently divergent to allow for ka/ks calculation. the aligned pairs of orthologs showed an average substitution of  <dig>  nt ranging from a minimum of 4 nt to a maximum of 167 nt substitutions. while strong sequence conservation  was detected in  <dig> % of the coding orthologs analysed , weak purifying selection, that is, a low rate of protein change denoted by a ka/ks ratio within the  <dig>  –  <dig>  range was demonstrated by  <dig> orthologs pairs. a single ortholog pair had a ka/ks ratio of approximately  <dig>  signifying neutral selection , while only one other pair showed gene divergence with a ka/ks ratio greater than  <dig> figure  <dig>

comparison of gene ontology  terms between highly conserved, less-conserved and the divergent group of orthologs showed that “binding activity” is over-represented in all  <dig> groups. this functional category is represented by  <dig> %, 50%, and 100% of orthologs belonging to the high purifying, weak purifying and the divergent ortholog set, respectively. within the high purifying group ,  <dig> sequences were specifically involved in atp binding activity, while  <dig> % of transcripts were metabolically active transcripts. the divergent group of orthologs presented hits to an unknown protein containing a myb-like binding domain .

other go categories that were obtained included “transport activity” and “translational activity” which were represented by 20% and 10% orthologs from the weak purifying subset, respectively.

druggability
to explore in silico drug targeting pipelines between t. foetus genotypes, only the  <dig>  predicted full-length orthologs were used for identification of potential drug target, with an added level of search stringency aimed at identifying non-host targets. of the  <dig>  ortholog pairs of transcripts blasted to their respective host proteome,  <dig> bovine t. foetus and  <dig> feline t. foetus transcripts were found to be unique to the parasite . approximately half of the parasite-only transcripts obtained  produced positive results to one or more druggable domains. from the feline blastx results to druggable domains,  <dig> %  of the domains adhere to the lipinsky rule of  <dig> for small molecule binding. this number was lowered to 43%  in the bovine druggable transcripts .

discussion
in this study, we characterized draft transcriptomes of two genotypes of tritrichomonas foetus; a trichomonad of veterinary significance, secondary in prominence only to the human trichomonas vaginalis. in the absence of a genome or sufficient background proteomics, a de novo rna-seq approach was used as an economical and high-throughput cell-wide gene discovery technique. currently, only a small expressed sequence library of the bovine t. foetus is available in the public domain  <cit> . here, existing expressed sequence data of the bovine t. foetus is augmented and we leverage the field by providing the first comprehensive expressed sequence library of a feline t. foetus genotype. gene discovery via rna sequencing projects provide an accurate representation of transcriptionally active regions of the genome, thus proving an accurate starting point for the unearthing of undiscovered genes  <cit> . with the expression blueprints of the bovine and feline t. foetus genotypes, the first cell-wide comparison of shared genes was undertaken and an in silico novel drug target analysis was explored. a draft genome has previously been published for the related human pathogen trichomonas vaginalis
 <cit> 
. however, phylogenetically, t. vaginalis and t. foetus are significantly divergent, impeding extension of molecular information between the two parasites. hence the sequence library we have constructed is currently the best depiction of the t. foetus genome to date and will reinforce the platform for future experimental studies on t. foetus cell biology and host-parasite interactions.

in general, the two t. foetus transcriptomes are comparable in size with a near identical gc content of approximately 35%. while this is equivalent to the gc content of t. vaginalis, it is lower than the previously published  <dig> % for bovine t. foetus, presumably owing to small library-size bias of the latter  <cit> 
. given the very distinct fundamental host requirements and the vastly different host niches occupied by these two genotypes, we were interested to identify to what degree this would be reflected in their respective gene profiles. we found no biologically significant differences in the distribution of functional annotations between the two t. foetus transcriptomes, despite the slight variances in culture conditions of the two genotypes in this study. this suggests that the two genotypes possess remarkably similar basal functioning. resemblances in functional capacity in transcriptome-wide studies of other protozoan groups are not uncommon  <cit> . to our knowledge, this has not been documented in flagellate protozoans extending over a diverse host range such as t. foetus. limited hints to host-origin were observed as approximately half of the transcripts were flagged as homologs between the genotypes, with 30% being orthologs shared from a common ancestor. as an alternative method of comparing the two t. foetus genotypes, the  <dig> most highly transcribed genes from each transcriptome were identified through counts of uniquely-mapped sequencing reads. unsurprisingly, functional categories of highly expressed t. foetus genes included nutrition-related genes, transcription factors and oxygen scavenging genes, with over 50% of the sequences being identified as shared orthologs of the two genotypes. although minor loss of detail is imminent, discarding multi-mapped reads for expression counts has shown overall reliability in depiction of highly expressed profiles from rna-seq data  <cit> . of the comparable highly transcribed orthologs, the most notable was the 8-fold difference in actin expression between the two isolates. actin is associated with a myriad of functions including whole cell and intracellular vacuole movement that contribute to parasite virulence . changes in cell morphology and increased interaction with host cells is associated with differential expression of actin in t. vaginalis
 <cit> . while potential culture artefacts cannot be ruled out in the current study, the discrepancy of actin expression between the genotypes is worthy of further characterization to better understand t. foetus virulence.

within their respective host niches, the bovine and feline t. foetus genotypes are exposed to extreme environmental constraints that place genes under selective pressure as an adaptive mechanism. these responses are seen in sequences as a ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions , which relates to the ratio of silent mutations to amino-acid changing mutations likely to alter protein functionality  <cit> . positive selective change was apparent in two pairs of shared t. foetus orthologs both, producing hits to a myb dna-binding domain containing protein. as one of the largest families of transcription factors, myb domain-containing proteins act to regulate the transcription of genes that control and implement important biological processes such as growth, encystation and virulence  <cit> . strong divergence of t. foetus transcription factors could imply unique adjustments of gene expression between the two genotypes according to their hosts. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> bovine and feline myb-like proteins, respectively, were annotated in the transcriptomes, suggesting an important role for these transcription factors. in the related t. vaginalis, myb-like nuclear proteins act to regulate transcription of a gene family that encode surface cytoadhesives such as the ap <dig> protein essential for the parasite adherence to host cells . taken together, the near identical transcriptomes and diversification of certain transcription factors suggest that transcription and post-transcription regulation form a major aspect of phenotypic host-specificity in t. foetus. it would seem that perhaps the pressure imposed by the differing hosts/niche environments has not, as of yet, been sufficient to drive molecular diversification at the amino acid level between these two genotypes. alternatively, these may not be evident in the absence of specific cues for the host. the myb-transcription factors present as ideal candidates for initial investigations into the extreme versatility of t. foetus that allows it to adapt rapidly to new, extreme environments presented by their non-original host.

untranslated regions  flanking either end of mrna coding regions contain inherent information, such as motif sequences, that govern and regulate the downstream translation of a protein  <cit> . under varying environmental conditions, utrs have the capacity to permit instantaneous phenotypic changes within the parasite to permit rapid responses to biological and environmental cues . here, we mined the untranslated regions  for translation regulatory features that may be acting in the bovine and feline t. foetus genotypes. one such feature is the length of the utrs which has been associated with mrna stability and translational efficiency  <cit> . a compilation of utr lengths from utr databases indicates that across groups of living organisms, 3′utr are longer than 5′utrs  <cit> . indeed the mean length of t. foetus utrs in this study follows the same length bias. the validity of comparing utr length to determine organism complexity, expression levels and breadth has generated mixed results . in the closely related t. vaginalis, the length of the glycolytic glyceraldehydes-2-phosphate dehydrogenase 3′utr did not show correlation to expression of the enzyme  <cit> . a more tangible manner of utr translational regulation is mediated through binding of small mrna-binding protein to cis-elements in the utr region of the target protein  <cit> . annotation of 5′ and 3′ utrs to known patterns in this study provide a glimpse of putative regulatory motifs at play in t. foetus. common motifs such as up-stream open reading frames   <cit> , internal ribosomal entry sites   <cit>  and au-rich class  <dig> elements   <cit>  have been identified here in the utrs of both t. foetus genotypes. functionality of several of the motifs found in t. foetus have been described in protozoan and in fact, in plasmodium, uorf presents an interesting case as it regulates a virulence-associated trait according to host physiological factors  <cit> . the unique feline t. foetus genotype motif; adh-dre, has not been described in protozoans and is related to the down-regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene  <cit> . nevertheless, finding common motif matches between t. foetus and other organisms in public databases confirms that the conserved nature of motif patterns extend to t. foetus. here, we attempted to by-pass the inherent transcription level limitation of rna-seq to provide an overview of putative translation-related mechanisms in t. foetus. bioinformatics tools, however, are currently relatively un-reliable in determining true functional regulatory motifs  <cit> . experimental characterisation of these motifs in t. foetus is required to elucidate regulatory relationships between regulators and the target in these parasites.

proteases are expressed by all organisms, playing a critical role in protein catabolism. in parasites, however, these enzymes have evolved specialized functions and are directly involved in numerous host-parasite interactions. proteases, also known as peptidases, can be classified into seven functional categories based on the principal residue occupying the active site: aspartic, cysteine, glutamic, serine, threonine, metallo and mixed  <cit> . each of these can be further divided into clans and families. trichomonad parasites also release soluble proteases in vitro and in vivo; the best studied of these being the cysteine proteases . proteases released into the host milieu, as well as those on the surface of parasites, are important virulence factors involved in host-cell adherence, evasion of host immunity and host cell cytotoxicity . approximately half of the proteases found in the transcriptomes in this study contained cysteine active sites and these were over-represented within a subset of highly expressed proteases. in bovine t. foetus, the most dominant cp family expressed was a papain type cp of the ca clan ; a large family of cps involved in facilitating infection in protozoa . this family is slightly less represented in the highest expressed proteases of the feline t. foetus. regulation of the type of cp secreted by parasites has important implications for the extent of infection in the host. in the related t. vaginalis, secreted cp fraction has been demonstrated to promote host-cell apoptosis. host-cell specificity of cps, however, is apparent when incubation of t. vaginalis cp <dig> with non-host bovine cells fails to induce the same level of cellular destruction compared to the effect of bovine t. foetus cp <dig> on bovine cells  <cit> . here, we confirm that cp <dig> is the most transcribed cp in the bovine t. foetus as reported by huang et al.  <cit> . to the contrary, cp <dig> was found to be more transcribed than cp <dig> in feline t. foetus suggesting that the increased expression of cp <dig> in feline genotype is a host-specific adapted virulence trait. cps are capable of inducing varying levels of cellular destruction depending on cell source and type. the difference in the major type of cp expressed between the genotypes may explain the slightly varied pathology described in experimental cross-infection of the hosts but the significance of this has yet to be elucidated  <cit> 
. our analysis revealed that the bovine transcriptome contained more hits to proteases than the feline t. foetus transcriptome which could be due to the fractionally higher sequence reads obtained for the bovine t. foetus. the significance of this finding will require full genome sequencing and analysis.

the collection of expressed sequences from the bovine and feline t. foetus genotypes made available in this study presents an opportunity for low-cost in silico mining of novel drug targets worthy of experimental follow-up. with mounting reports of drug resistance and toxic host side-effects, the treatment of choice for human and feline trichomonad infections remains the 5-nitromidazoles drugs  <cit> . to date, significant, yet non-model protozoan species have been overlooked for in silico mining for druggable targets. computational pipelines for drug-target discovery have been limited to the few high-profile protozoans with a sequenced genome or focused on identifying druggable features at the host-parasite interface  <cit> . here we explore drug target identification for a unique case of a protozoan species with a broad, distantly-related host-range. novel drug targets for experimental follow-up have to be compatible and non-toxic for the host-species undergoing treatment. in our analysis we intentionally only included shared, full-length t. foetus sequences to gain insights as to how the presence of endogenous host proteins could affect strategies for drug target identification of the same parasite species. by excluding similar host genes, a maximum of 5% of the druggable parasite-unique genes remained, the majority of which were not common between the two genotypes. while the list we generated from our analysis is purposed to be more illustrative rather than definitive; the findings stress the importance of taking different hosts into account as a part of target prioritization in more generalist parasites like t. foetus.

CONCLUSIONS
the expressed genes of the bovine and feline tritrichomonas foetus genotypes offer insights into the breadth of both the t. foetus coding and non-coding genomes. this parasite represents an interesting biological model as it represents a unique case of a protozoan expanding its parasitic foothold across distantly related mammalian hosts. despite extreme environmental conditions found between bovine urogenital tract and the feline digestive tract inhabited by the two genotypes, they possess near identical functional category distribution of expressed genes with no indication of molecular-level divergence. this reinforces the fact that taxonomically, the bovine and feline t. foetus represent two genotypes displaying intra-specific variation. host-specific adaptation strategies appear to be focused on post-transcription regulation influenced by environmental cues within the two host niches. in this manner, expression patterns of virulence genes may differ in accordance to their host. although rna-seq has provided insights into expression patterns, proteomics studies need to be carried out to examine the full extent of these patterns between the genotypes. nevertheless, the role of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in t. foetus warrants consideration to guide further research since studies on an environmental-dependent gene in one genotype will not necessarily be representative of the other genotype. hence, host genes and biology have to be taken into account, particularly in the design of new drug strategies. while in silico methods offer an ideal starting point for novel drug target identification, here we highlight the importance of taking both genotypes and their hosts into account to avoid downstream mis-identification of common drug targets. taken as a whole, the cell-wide gene library of the bovine and feline t. foetus generated in this study is a useful platform to guide trichomonad research.
