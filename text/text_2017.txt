BACKGROUND
despite more than a century of research, the mechanisms of meiosis in flowering plants remain largely unknown with respect to the regulation and progression of homologous chromosome pairing, synapse, recombination, and segregation  <cit> . until the late 1990s, yeast was the primary model system for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis  <cit> , while flowering plants were only sparingly explored with the exception of cytological studies  <cit> . in the past decade, however, flowering plants have become model systems to unravel the principles of meiosis in multicellular organisms  <cit> . genetic resources from model plants such as arabidopsis and rice have been significantly enhanced since the year  <dig> as genome sequences were completed and genome-wide t-dna insertion mutants became available  <cit> .

compared to the functional genomic studies on pollen/gametophyte, in which significant progress has been made  <cit> , using flowering plants to study meiosis has some inherent methodological challenges, especially the relatively small physical size of anthers that undergo meiosis in plants, and the small size is particularly the case in arabidopsis  <cit> . although the male meiocytes  are highly synchronized in anther lobes, each anther contains only a small fraction of male meiocytes. for instance, male meiocytes constitute about 1% of arabidopsis anther tissues, making the isolation of meiocytes challenging . to date, several methods have been developed to concentrate meiocytes for transcriptome or proteome profiling. one approach was developed for collecting meiocytes from brassica that have larger anthers  <cit> . subsequent meiotic proteomics analysis, however, could not directly characterize gene functions in meiosis due to the limited genetic resources in brassica, i.e., a characterized mutant collection, although a number of genes with potential functions in meiosis were identified  <cit> . other researchers have collected anthers that are undergoing meiosis in several species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit>  for transcriptomic studies, since anthers are much easier to obtain compared to meiocytes. as mentioned above, this approach is inefficient for the exploration of meiosis, as only a small portion of cells in anthers are meiocytes . genes identified through this approach also included genes that are specific for anther wall development   <cit> .

we hypothesize that the meiosis-specific genes can be identified by comparing transcriptome profiles of meiocytes and anthers with seedling controls. a number of techniques are available for sampling specific plant cells, including fluorescence-activated cell sorting   <cit>  and laser capture microdissection   <cit> . lcm has been successfully applied in specific plant cell sampling and transcriptome analyses  <cit> , such as transcriptional profiling during arabidopsis embryogenesis  <cit> . although facs and lcm have been very useful in many areas of plant transcriptome analyses, the potential biases, such as the enzyme digestion in facs and mrna amplification in lcm make these methods less appealing to researchers who perform transcriptome profiling of key biological processes such as meiosis  <cit> . the lack of efficient methods to isolate meiocytes largely accounts for the lack of progress in global identifications of plant meiotic genes. at present, only  <dig> meiotic genes have been identified in arabidopsis, largely through mutagenesis and phylogenetic experiments  <cit>  . by way of comparison,  <dig> core-meiotic genes have been found in yeast through microarray analysis, and more than  <dig> have been studied at the molecular level  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe the application of a newly developed method to effectively collect male meiocytes, which enables the collection of sufficient total rna for transcriptome studies from highly condensed meiocytes without mrna amplification. from the total rna collected using this method, we have applied rna-seq technology and bioinformatic analysis to identify meiosis-specific genes in arabidopsis. as a result,  <dig> genes on pericentromeric region of chromosome ii that covers a large mitochondrial genomic insertion  and  <dig>  transposable element  genes were discovered to be preferentially or specifically expressed in meiocytes.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing
the sequencing of meiocyte, anther and seedling transcriptomes generated average genome and transcriptome coverage over 10Ã—. technical replicates were highly reproducible . the percentage of reads aligned to the genome was an average of 79%, 75% and 81% for meiocyte, anther and seedling libraries, respectively. the percentage of reads aligned is a function both of the quality of the libraries and the relative completeness of the arabidopsis genome. through the comparative analysis of sequencing datasets against the tair  <dig> reference data, at the cutoff point of five reads per million reads, a total of  <dig>  genes were expressed in meiocytes, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes detected in seedling and anther controls, respectively . at a cutoff of one read per million reads, however,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were expressed in meiocytes, seedlings and anthers, respectively. together, the results suggest a significantly large population of genes are expressed in meiocytes at low levels.

gene ontology  analysis revealed groups of functionally-related, annotated genes expressed in meiocytes . a comparative go analysis among previously annotated nuclear genes that were detected in meiocytes, anthers and seedlings revealed distinct gene expression profiles among the different tissues. notably, by cellular components, a significantly increased number of functionally unknown cellular component genes were expressed in meiocytes, while an increased percentage of other cytoplasmic component genes were expressed in anthers and chloroplast genes in seedlings . in addition, when genes expressed in meiocytes were partitioned by biological process, a smaller number of genes function in dna or rna metabolism, and a larger number of signal transduction genes were observed, which suggested a lower level of dna or rna metabolic activity and a higher level of signal transduction occurs in meiosis . by molecular function, meiocytes demonstrated significantly higher activities of nucleotide binding and lower levels of kinase activities when compared to anthers and seedlings .

statistical analysis
anova analysis of all pair-wise differences between seedling , anther control  and anther meiocytes  was determined as described in the materials and methods. a total of  <dig>  differences were noted in the three comparisons . the heat map analysis suggested a number of the changes were unique to anthers or meiocytes . because of the high similarity in technical replicates , a second filter of at least a twofold or greater expression difference in the pair-wise comparisons was performed to reduce the total number of significant changes. this reduced the total number of significantly expressed genes to  <dig>  . to find unique meiosis genes that were only differentially expressed within meiocytes compared to anthers, we performed venn diagrams  of the significantly expressed genes after anova and the twofold filter. there were  <dig> genes that were uniquely expressed in a comparison of meiocytes anthers, among which  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in meiocytes.

transcript profiling of studied meiotic genes
in arabidopsis, a total of  <dig> genes have been reported to date with functions in meiosis . among them, ms <dig>  atsrp <dig>  and atsrp <dig> were not detected in seedlings  <cit> ; and mnd <dig>  atspo11- <dig>  atsrp <dig> and ms <dig> were expressed at twofold or greater levels in meiocytes than anthers. however, the expression levels of atsrp <dig> and mnd <dig> were very low in meiocytes, at  <dig>  reads per million reads  <cit> .  <dig> genes were expressed at twofold or greater in meiocytes than in seedlings and  <dig> genes were expressed at twofold or greater in anthers than in seedlings.  <dig> of  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in both meiocytes and anthers compared to seedlings, which include key meiotic recombination genes, such as atspo11- <dig>  atdmc <dig>  atrad51c, atxrcc <dig>  atmsh <dig>  atmsh <dig>  atmer3/rck, ptd, atmus <dig>  and sds  <cit> .  <dig> genes didn't show significantly differential expression in all explored tissues, which included genes that were not meiosis-specific, or may function in both meiosis and mitosis, i.e. aml <dig>  aml <dig>  aml <dig>  ask <dig>  atk <dig>  <cit> .

mitochondrial genomic insertion genes on chromosome ii are preferentially expressed in meiocytes
a large genomic block on chromosome ii pericentromeric region was found to have genes expressed preferentially in meiocytes. the genomic block included a ~ <dig> kb region that was reported to be of mitochondrial genome origin  <cit> , which was believed to be approximately  <dig> kb with repeated mitochondrial genomic fragments and an unsequenced gap  <cit> . in our analysis,  <dig> genes were found in the region spanning from at2g <dig> to at2g <dig>  . with the cutoff of one read per million reads in meiocytes,  <dig> genes on this block were preferentially or specifically expressed in meiocytes versus anthers. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were considered to be only expressed in meiocytes with less than one read per million reads in anthers, and  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in meiocytes, including  <dig> genes that were expressed at fourfold or greater in meiocytes than in anthers .

transposable element genes expressed in meiocytes
transposable elements  are a ubiquitous feature of plant genomes. at a cutoff of one read per million reads,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> te genes were expressed in meiocytes, seedlings and anthers, respectively. in this study, a total of  <dig>  te genes demonstrated differential expression in meiocytes and anthers with at least a twofold difference . among the  <dig>  te genes,  <dig> genes were only expressed in meiocytes with no reads or less than one read per million reads in anthers, such as at3g <dig>  at2g13110; and only  <dig> genes were only expressed in anthers.  <dig> genes were detected in both meiocytes and anthers with differential expression, including  <dig> genes that were preferentially expressed in meiocytes versus anthers, i. e. at2g <dig>  at5g <dig>  and  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in anthers versus meiocytes, such as at1g <dig>  at4g <dig> . together, there were  <dig>  te genes up-regulated and  <dig> te genes down-regulated in meiocytes versus in anthers. since the te genes are enriched in the pericentromeric regions, as shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution of differentially expressed tes in meiocytes versus anthers is also seen at pericentromeric regions in all  <dig> chromosomes .

go analysis has demonstrated that meiocyte preferentially expressed te genes belong to  <dig> te super families with  <dig> % of tes that are unassigned .  <dig> % of differentially expressed tes detected in meiocytes are ltr/gypsy super family transposons, and  <dig> % of belong to the dna/mudr super family. additional details are also presented . a tree-map of functional categories using agrigo-revigo toolkit is also provided .

a comparative analysis of te gene expression in meiocytes versus seedlings resulted in a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed te genes . among the  <dig>  te genes,  <dig>  genes were meiocyte-specific with no reads or less than one read per million reads in seedlings; and only  <dig> genes that were seedling-specific.  <dig> genes were detected in both meiocytes and seedlings with differential expression, including  <dig> genes that were preferentially expressed in meiocytes, and  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in seedlings. together, there were  <dig>  te genes up-regulated and  <dig> te genes down-regulated in meiocytes versus in seedlings .

discussion
refining the criteria for meiotic gene identification by profiling studied genes that function in meiosis
 <dig> genes in arabidopsis have been identified and characterized with function in meiosis using forward and reverse genetic approaches . the  <dig> known arabidopsis genes with functions in meiosis can be assigned to four functional categories: 1) genes which function in homologous chromosome pairing and recombination   <cit> ; 2) genes that encode structural proteins such as cohesin, histone, centromere proteins and proteins for synaptonemal complex assembly, e.g., syn1/dif <dig>  smc <dig>  zyp <dig>  and asy <dig>  <cit> ; 3) genes which function in chromosome spindle organization and movement   <cit> ; and 4) genes which encode regulatory proteins such as mmd1/duet, sds, tam, and ask <dig>  <cit> . by profiling the gene expression of all  <dig> genes in meiocytes and control tissues, meiosis-specific candidate genes can be efficiently identified by following the two criteria: 1) genes are expressed at twofold or greater in meiocytes versus anthers; and/or 2) genes are expressed at twofold or greater in both meiocytes and anthers versus seedlings with the exclusion of genes that are expressed at fourfold or greater in anthers versus meiocytes.

three genes, mnd <dig>  atsrp <dig>  atsrp <dig>  were expressed at very low levels and only had  <dig>  read per million reads in meiocytes, which suggests more sequence data or a lower cutoff point is needed in order to cover all important meiosis-specific genes for these datasets  <cit> . only  <dig> genes  <cit>  meet the first criterion with preferential expression in meiocytes, and  <dig> genes were expressed twofold or greater in both meiocytes and anthers comparing to seedlings, which include key meiotic recombination genes, such as atspo11- <dig>  atdmc <dig>  asy <dig>  atmlh <dig>  atrad51c, atxrcc <dig>  atmsh <dig>  atmsh <dig>  atmer3/rck, ptd, atmus <dig>  and sds  <cit>  . genes that do not meet the two criteria are unlikely to be meiosis-specific; for example, atk5/kin14b may also have important roles in mitotic cell division  <cit> . atrad <dig> has a meiosis-specific function in arabidopsis, but it is expressed in both meiocytes and non-meiotic somatic cells  <cit> , which is consistent to the rad <dig> gene expression in other organisms, such as mice b cells  <cit> . most of the meiosis-specific genes, especially for those in the meiotic recombination pathways could be identified by comparative analysis of transcriptome profiles of meiocytes, anthers and seedlings  <cit>  .

a visual representation of all statistically different genes from the anova is presented as in the ward hierarchical clustering, which suggests a number of genes that are uniquely expressed in the anther as well as the meiocyte that may be unique candidate genes for control of expression . as shown in figure  <dig>  with a cutoff point of  <dig> reads per million reads in at least one sample, more than  <dig>  candidate meiosis-specific genes were identified through this approach with an additional  <dig> genes that are preferentially expressed in meiocytes .

the main purpose of profiling concentrated meiocytes is to eliminate genes that are expressed and function in anther wall development, which is critical, because those genes would be included in the candidate gene pools for entire anther development if transcriptomic analysis is performed using anther materials  <cit> . a criterion we suggest for meiotic gene identification is to exclude genes that are expressed at fourfold or greater in anthers versus meiocytes, although the gene expression level may be up-regulated in both meiocytes and anthers versus seedlings. for example, dyt <dig> was found in a gene pool by profiling anther transcriptome compared to other organs, and functions in regulating anther wall development  <cit> . here we show that dyt <dig> was read at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  reads per million reads in meiocytes, anthers, and seedlings, respectively. the differential expression indicates that dyt <dig> is specifically expressed in anthers/meiocytes with a significantly preferential expression in anthers, which is consistent to its function in anther wall development  <cit> . another example is the ata <dig> gene that was reported to be highly expressed in tapetum  <cit> , and the rna-seq results read at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  reads per million reads in meiocytes, anthers and seedlings, respectively. both dyt <dig> and ata <dig> were preferentially expressed in anthers versus meiocytes, which implies the feasibility of excluding the anther wall genes by comparative analysis of transcriptome profiling of meiocytes, anthers and seedlings. as indicated in criterion  <dig> for meiosis-specific gene identification, genes that are expressed at fourfold or greater in anthers versus meiosis should be considered as non-meiosis-specific candidate genes, or candidate genes for anther wall development.

although this study has not included a parallel transcriptome study of microspore/gametophyte, the life after meiosis, a comparison of meiocytes  should advance our understanding of the molecular connections between the two key processes of reproduction development, as well as promoting the means of identification of meiosis-specific genes. previously, pollen transcriptome profiling using microarrays have found  <dig>  genes expressed in arabidopsis landsberg erecta with  <dig> pollen-specific  <cit>  and  <dig>  expressed in arabidopsis col- <dig> ecotype <cit> . since the meiocytes we collected included tetrads, there is likely to be a significant overlap between meiocytes and microspores. a further deep transcriptome sequencing using staged meiosis-i meiocytes is currently being performed.

genes in a mitochondria genomic insertion on chromosome ii were preferentially expressed in meiocytes
previously, genome sequence analyses of chromosome ii revealed a  <dig> kb chromosome region located on the short arm adjacent to the centromere and was annotated as a putative mitochondrial genome insertion  <cit> . this annotation was adopted by tair  and salk t-dna express: the arabidopsis gene mapping tool . fiber fish analysis uncovered the structure of the mgi in col- <dig> ecotype as an approximately  <dig> kb mitochondrial genomic insertion with several duplicated segments and events  <cit> . thirty-two orphan rnas were found on this region  <cit> . since this region is in the genetic centromere region and thought to be of mitochondrial origin, the function and transcript profile of this genomic block remains unknown. our data showed that all  <dig> genes detected in both meiocytes and anthers were preferentially expressed in meiocytes, in which  <dig> genes were expressed at fourfold or greater in meiocytes versus anthers. . 39% of the  <dig> genes encode unknown proteins, 17% for pre-trnas, others are ribosomal proteins , cytochrome proteins , transposable elements , transporter proteins  and nadh-ubiquinone proteins , which suggest this group of genes may function in meiosis . a preliminary investigation on the t-dna insertion lines targeted on mgi genes confirmed that some mutants on the mgi block have meiotic phenotypes , which further suggest the functions of mgi in meiosis in the col- <dig> ecotype of arabidopsis.

transposable element genes in meiosis
while transposable elements  make up to 14% of arabidopsis genome  <cit> , the majority of tes were silenced during plant development since there were a lack of mrnas, but higher levels of small rnas were detected  <cit> . tes' activities were usually limited in just one or a few of developmental stages, in which tes were expressed  <cit> . in comparing the transcriptomes of anther and meiocytes, we observed a large set of tes that were expressed preferentially or specifically in meiocytes versus anthers. at a cutoff point of one read per million reads, a total of  <dig>  te genes were expressed in meiocytes, which is about  <dig> % of  <dig>  te genes reported or annotated in arabidopsis  <cit>  . relatively smaller numbers of te genes were expressed in controls:  <dig> and  <dig> in anthers and seedlings, respectively. with  <dig>  te genes up-regulated and  <dig> te genes down-regulated in meiocytes compared to anthers, te genes may play unique roles in meiosis. in addition,  <dig>  te genes were up-regulated and  <dig> te genes down-regulated in meiocytes as compared to seedlings, which are consistent with the comparison between meiocytes and anthers, and demonstrated more significant deviation between meiocytes and seedlings .

the abundant te expression in meiocytes suggests substantial activities of tes in meiosis. it is believed that tes affect recombination in all meiotic eukaryotes  <cit> . recent studies on postmeiotic gametophyte development have found that te genes are unexpectedly reactivated and transpose only in the vegetative nucleus, but not in the sperm cells of pollen  <cit> , which suggest that small interfering rnas  from tes activated in the vegetative nucleus can target silencing those in gametes  <cit> . in addition, small rna pathways have been found to be present and functional in the angiosperm male gametophytes  <cit> . during female gamete formation, ago <dig> was found to preferentially interact with sirnas derived from tes and the activity of ago <dig> is required to silence tes in female gametes and their accessory cells  <cit> . the ago <dig> gene  was preferentially expressed in anthers versus meiocytes  in this study, which is consistent with the discovery of a postmeiotic function. in contrast, the two ago genes, at1g <dig>  and at5g <dig>  were preferentially or specifically expressed in meiocytes , which suggest that molecules regulating gene silencing and dna modification in meiosis differ from those of postmeiotic gametophyte development, both in the male and the female. in the postmeiotic gametes, the gene expression map has demonstrated the similarities between plants and animals  <cit> , which may also be true in meiosis. to date, it still remains largely unknown how tes function in meiosis. it is possible that a large number of tes are activated in meiosis and then silenced after meiosis through sirna machinery and/or modification of heterochromatin.

CONCLUSIONS
a high-throughput approach to identify meiosis-specific genes by comparative profiles of meiocyte, anther and seedling transcriptomes using rna-seq, bioinformatic and statistical analysis pipelines was established. two criteria for meiosis-specific gene identification were defined. using this method, thousands of genes that are preferentially expressed in anthers would be excluded from a meiosis-specific candidate gene pool; a mgi block was found to be specifically expressed during meiosis; and  <dig>  transposable element genes were also preferentially expressed in meiocytes with potential functions in meiosis. these findings provide a framework for future functional analysis of genes in meiosis and advance our understanding of meiotic genes, gene expression and regulation.
