BACKGROUND
nutritionists have recommended an increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, as sources of dietary compounds such as fibre, micronutrients and antioxidant compounds that are beneficial to human health  <cit> . apple  is considered to be part of such a healthy diet, being very low in total calories and a good source of dietary fibre   <cit> . while apples are lower in vitamin c than other fruits , they have very high concentrations of other antioxidant phytochemicals, especially polyphenolic compounds such as quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin polymers  <cit> .

numerous epidemiological studies have suggested that polyphenolic compounds are involved in the prevention of degenerative diseases such as epithelial  cancers and cardiovascular diseases, type- <dig> diabetes, thrombotic stroke, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging and infections  <cit> . although polyphenolic compounds have long been studied for their antioxidant properties, which are now well characterized in vitro, recent studies have stressed that the mechanisms of biological actions of polyphenols extend beyond their antioxidant properties  <cit> . it is now believed that polyphenols may exert their beneficial action through the modulation of gene expression and the activity of a wide range of enzymes and cell receptors  <cit> . however, the health effects of dietary polyphenols depend on the amounts consumed and on their bioavailability. previous studies suggest that the bioavailability of polyphenols is related to their chemical structure  <cit> . for instance, the nature of the sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycone are both important for anthocyanin absorption and excretion.

several thousand compounds having a polyphenolic structure have been identified in higher plants  <cit> . these compounds are secondary metabolites involved in defence against aggression by pathogens or ultraviolet radiation. the most important groups of polyphenols in plants are the flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans and stilbenes. the flavonoid group can be subdivided into seven subgroups: flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanols, flavanones, anthocyanins and dihydrochalcones of which flavonols, flavanols, anthocyanins and dihydrochalcones are found in apple  <cit> . the flavonols' main representatives, quercetin and kaempferol, are present in glycosylated forms and the associated sugar moiety is often glucose or rhamnose. flavanols are not glycosylated, and exist in both the monomer form  and the polymer form . catechin and epicatechin are the main flavanols in fruits and are the building blocks for dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins. anthocyanins are pigments dissolved in the vacuolar sap of usually the epidermal tissues of fruits and exist in a range of chemical forms that are blue, red, purple, pink or colourless according to ph. they are highly unstable as aglycones and in plants are found in glycosylated forms that are stable under light, ph and oxidizing conditions. cyanidin and pelargonidin are the most common anthocyanins in foods. finally, dihydrochalcones are a family of the bicyclic flavonoids, defined by the presence of two benzenoid rings joined by a three-carbon bridge. phloridzin, which belongs to the dihydrochalcone family, is present in apple fruits  <cit> .

two classes of phenolic acids can be distinguished: derivatives of benzoic acid, and derivatives of cinnamic acid. these acids are found in plants both free and esterified with sugars or other organic acids  <cit> . hydroxycinnamic acids are more common than hydroxybenzoic acids, with the main compounds of the hydroxycinnamic acid class being p-coumaric, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids. hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids are also components of complex structures such as hydrolysable tannins  and lignins, respectively.

polyphenolic content and identity can vary according to location within the fruit , stage of fruit maturity, location of the fruit within the plant structure and time since harvest. fruit polyphenolic concentration varies among apple cultivars  <cit> , making this character a potential breeding target. however, current apple breeding programmes emphasize appearance , eating quality , and storage ability. breeding for pest and disease resistances is the second major objective  <cit> . we are not aware of a breeding programme for apple that includes phytochemical properties and antioxidant content, despite the importance of healthy nutraceutical compounds from apple and other fruit. consequently genetic mapping studies have focused on fruit quality and disease resistance and only a few have dealt with apple phytochemical content. quantitative trait loci  for vitamin c have been identified following analysis of a 'telamon' × 'braeburn' segregating population  <cit>  and a major locus for anthocyanin content in apple flesh has been mapped to linkage group   <dig>  <cit> . expression of this locus has been characterised as being controlled by myb <dig>  <cit> .

this study analyses the genetic control of fruit polyphenolic concentrations using a segregating f <dig> population obtained from a cross between apple cultivars 'royal gala' and 'braeburn', together with information from the apple whole genome sequence . once quantitative trait loci  were defined, candidate genes coding for enzymes involved in the synthesis of polyphenolic compounds were identified using genome sequencing and confirmed by genetic mapping. on the basis of our results, we suggest that a mutation in lar <dig> is the probable cause of the variation in the concentration of flavanols in the fruit cortex and skin and that a similar change in hqt/hct possibly causes variation in chlorogenic acid.

RESULTS
analysis of apple polyphenolics by uhplc in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population
fruit from a 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population were analysed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography  in  <dig> and  <dig> . twenty-three compounds with variable concentrations were quantified in the apple fruit cortex and skin samples in  <dig> and  <dig> compounds in  <dig> . the concentration of each compound varied depending on the compound and tissue. the minimum concentration observed for all  <dig> compounds was below the detection limit of the instrument.

the concentrations are expressed in μg/g of fresh weight. min.: minimum; max.: maximum; rg: 'royal gala'; bb: 'braeburn'.

flavonols
quercetin glycosides were the only flavonols detected in the apples analysed. seven main quercetin glycosides were identified: quercetin 3-o-rutinoside, quercetin 3-o-galactoside, quercetin 3-o-glucoside, quercetin 3-o-xyloside, quercetin 3-o-arabinopyranoside, quercetin 3-o-arabinofuranoside, and quercetin 3-o-rhamnoside. the most concentrated flavonol was quercetin 3-o-galactoside. quercetin aglycone was detected for two individuals only, one in the fruit skin and another in the cortex. flavonols predominated in the fruit skin; however, these were virtually absent or not detected in the cortex . the correlations between fruit harvested in  <dig> and  <dig> ranged from r <dig> =  <dig>  to r <dig> =  <dig>  and there was no correlation for quercetin 3-o-xyloside between years. skin flavonols were highly correlated among themselves and showed medium to high correlations with other polyphenolic compounds present in the skin, such as anthocyanins, flavanols and dihydrochalcones . all flavonol compounds exhibited a skewed phenotypic distribution in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population in both  <dig> and  <dig> .

flavanols
eight flavanol compounds represented the second major class of compounds in both skin and cortex. three were identified as catechin, procyanidin b <dig> and epicatechin. five compounds matched procyanidin spectra and were deemed unknown procyanidin oligomers. epicatechin was the compound with highest concentrations in both skin and cortex, followed by procyanidin b <dig>  the correlations for flavanol concentration between years were medium  to high . flavanols were highly correlated among themselves within the cortex and skin, and between cortex and skin, and with flavonols in the skin. all flavanols showed a skewed distribution in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population, except for cortex procyanidin b <dig> and the unknown procyanidins  <dig> and  <dig>  which exhibited bimodal distributions.

anthocyanins
four cyanidin glycosides were identified: cyanidin 3-o-galactoside, cyanidin 3-o-arabinoside, and two unknown cyanidins. anthocyanins predominated in the fruit skin and were virtually absent from the cortex of fruit from the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' population. the year to year correlations for cyanidin 3-o-arabinoside and cyanidin 3-o-galactoside were medium high . cyanidin 3-o-galactoside was intermediately correlated with flavanol  and flavonol compounds in the skin . all anthocyanin compounds exhibited a skewed distribution in the segregating population.

hydroxycinnamic acids
chlorogenic acid  and p-coumaroyl quinic acid were found in both skin and cortex of the apples. although the total hydroxycinnamic acids were only a small proportion of the total polyphenolic profile of the skin, they represented the major group in the fruit cortex, with chlorogenic acid accounting for nearly 40% of all polyphenolics detected in the cortex. the correlation between years was high for both compounds except for skin p-coumaroyl quinic acid . both chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroyl quinic acid showed skewed distributions in both skin and cortex in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population.

dihydrochalcones
phloridzin and phloridzin-xyloside were the only dihydrochalcones found in both skin and cortex of apple. the year to year correlation for both compounds was low to medium . skin phloridzin and phloridzin-xyloside was correlated with both skin flavanol and flavonol compounds. all skin and cortex dihydrochalcones exhibited a skewed distribution in the segregating population.

genetic map construction and qtl analysis
a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers originally developed from 'golden delicious' to genetically anchor the 'golden delicious' apple genome sequence  <cit>  were genotyped in the  <dig> individuals of the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population using  <dig> snplex™ assays. of these snp markers,  <dig>  were polymorphic, while  <dig>  failed and  <dig>  were monomorphic. genetic maps anchored to the apple genome sequence were constructed for both parents using the subset of  <dig> individuals that was phenotyped for polyphenolic compounds. a subset of  <dig> snp markers was used to construct a 'braeburn' genetic map with as even a marker distribution as possible and favouring backcross type markers  above less informative intercross markers . this map spanned a cumulative distance of  <dig> . <dig> cm, covered all  <dig> lgs, had an average of one marker every  <dig>  cm and its largest gap was  <dig>  cm . one linkage group  spanned only  <dig>  cm and had only three markers. ninety-six markers were of the backcross type  and  <dig> were intercross type . a subset of  <dig> snp markers was used to build the 'royal gala' genetic map, using similar distribution and segregation type criteria as for the 'braeburn' map;  <dig> of these were of the backcross type and  <dig> were the less informative intercross type. the cumulative genetic size for the 'royal gala' genetic map was  <dig>  cm, covering all  <dig> lgs, with an average of one marker every  <dig>  cm and a largest gap of  <dig>  cm.

seventy-nine qtls for  <dig> compounds were detected over  <dig> lgs using multiple qtl  analysis , with explained genotypic variation ranging from 5% to  <dig> %. four qtls for procyanidin b <dig> and two unknown procyanidin oligomers were detected using the kruskal-wallis test . forty-one and  <dig> qtls were detected on the 'royal gala' and 'braeburn' maps, respectively. the largest cluster of qtls was located at the top of lg  <dig>  where  <dig> qtls were detected for flavanol compounds within the same region on both parental maps. seven clusters were found where qtls were stable between years and for classes of compounds , including: quercetin 3-o-rutinoside in fruit skin for 'royal gala' on lg 17; cyanidin 3-o-galactoside and cyanidin 3-o-arabinoside in fruit skin for both parents on lg 9; all eight measured flavanols in fruit skin and cortex for both parents on lg 16; chlorogenic acid in fruit skin and cortex for 'royal gala' on lg 17; p-coumaroyl quinic acid in fruit cortex for 'braeburn' on lg 15; p-coumaroyl quinic acid in fruit skin and cortex for 'royal gala' on lg 1; p-coumaroyl quinic acid in fruit skin and cortex for both parents on lg  <dig>  other qtls were detected on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for a range of compounds in individual years, but were not found across years.
significance of the qtl at the genome-wide level was tested using  <dig>  permutations: *: 90%, **: 95% and ***: 99%.

candidate gene co-location with qtls
candidate genes predicted on the basis of involvement in the polyphenolic biosynthetic pathway  were located bioinformatically on the 'golden delicious' whole genome sequence assembly using blastn analysis .

the approximate physical position on the apple linkage group  is given in kilobases  from the top of the lg.

three candidate genes co-located bioinformatically with qtl clusters related to corresponding compound concentrations. a putative hydroxy cinnamate transferase/hydroxy quinate transferase  was located near the bottom of lg  <dig>  where there is a stable chlorogenic acid qtl. the predicted apple protein on lg  <dig> for hct and hqt  was highly similar to artichoke hct  and hqt <dig>   <cit> , respectively. leucoanthocyanidin reductase  <dig>   <cit>  was positioned at the top of lg  <dig> and co-located with the cluster of qtls for flavanols. five predicted gene models with identical positions had significant sequence similarities with lar <dig> in this genomic region. pcr primers were developed from genomic sequences for both lar <dig> and hct/hqt, to enable the candidates to be mapped genetically with respect to the respective qtls. anthocyanidin synthase , located on lg  <dig> within a qtl from 'braeburn' for p-coumaroyl quinic acid in the fruit skin, was found in  <dig> only.

seven candidate genes were positioned on linkage groups with no associated qtls: pal, f3h, anr, fls, c4h, 4cl and dfr. eight of the candidate genes were positioned on linkage groups where some qtls were detected; however, most of these candidate genes did not locate within the qtl intervals, or if they co-located there was not an obvious functional biosynthetic pathway correlation between the candidate gene and the compound for which the qtls were identified.

the high resolution melting -based genetic marker for hct/hqt mapped at the bottom of lg  <dig> of the 'braeburn' parental map. location of the candidate gene within the qtl interval was hence determined based on alignment of the 'braeburn' map with the 'royal gala' map .

the hrm-based genetic marker for lar <dig> that mapped at the top of lg  <dig> was fully informative, segregating ef x eg, and it could be employed for qtl detection in both parental maps. the pcr primers for this polymorphic marker were positioned in the fourth intron of lar <dig>  this marker had the highest lod score for all eight flavanol compounds in both parental maps . mqm analysis with lar <dig> as a cofactor revealed no other qtl within the lg  <dig> region or anywhere else in the genome. the f and g alleles for 'royal gala' and 'braeburn', respectively, were associated with higher concentration of flavanols. the individuals carrying the homozygous ee genotype exhibited significantly lower concentrations of flavanol compounds in the fruit skin and no flavanol was detected in the fruit cortex .

a comprehensive search of the  <dig>  mb genomic region spanning the flavanol qtl cluster on lg  <dig> was performed to ascertain whether candidate genes other than lar <dig> are also located within this qtl interval. in total,  <dig> apple predicted genes with supporting cdna sequences were identified between  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on lg  <dig> . of these,  <dig> had possible regulatory or direct effects on polyphenolic biosynthesis  and included transcription factors of the classes zinc-finger c2h <dig>  constans-like, ap <dig> bzip, bhlhs, mybs and myb-related.

the approximate physical position on the apple linkage group  is given in kilobases  from the top of the lg calculated using assembled metacontigs of the apple genome sequence  <cit> .

we compared the flavanol compounds content of individuals from the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population with commercial cultivars, as well as two related species with extreme polyphenolic content: quince and a crab apple . quince  was at the low extreme of epicatechin content, far below that found for the lowest member of the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population, while the highest epicatechin concentration in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' progeny was about the same as that in crab apple . nevertheless, the apple 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' progeny with the less favourable allele of lar <dig>  was always low.

discussion
variation in concentration of polyphenolic compounds concentrations in a segregating apple population
the twenty-five fruit polyphenolics compounds analysed by uhplc varied greatly in concentration among progenies in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population, indicating that there is a serious risk that the process of breeding could rapidly decrease concentrations of nutraceutical compounds positively associated with human health through selection for linked negatively correlated traits. while the parents of our mapping population  are moderate in their polyphenolic concentrations, apple germplasm exists with far higher concentrations , indicating the opportunity to raise or lower polyphenolic concentration by breeders. differences were observed in polyphenolics concentrations in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population between  <dig> and  <dig>  these differences are likely to be due to variations in climatic conditions between both years.

qtls for polyphenolic compounds
our mapping of qtls for polyphenolic compounds in fruit from the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population has added considerably to the body of knowledge concerning the genetic architecture of the control of antioxidant content in apple, previously limited to mapping of qtls for ascorbate  <cit> , fruit skin anthocyanic colouration  <cit>  and a major locus for fruit cortex anthocyanin content  <cit> . seven qtl clusters were stable across two years of harvest and spanned a total of  <dig> individual qtls that were highly significant and included loci for content of flavanols, flavonols, anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids. although the further  <dig> qtls putatively controlling concentration for eight polyphenolic compounds detected from either  <dig> or  <dig> fruit harvests still require verification, their number indicates the complexity of control of biosynthesis in apple fruit of compounds contributing to human health and points towards the influence of environmental as well as genetic factors.

a qtl cluster for skin anthocyanins was detected at the bottom of lg  <dig>  in the region where a major locus for skin colouration was mapped earlier using a sequence characterized amplified region  marker  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that myb <dig> is involved in skin colouration  <cit> . our finding confirms these observations.

a qtl cluster for chlorogenic acid co-located with the hct/hqt gene. chlorogenic acid is the most concentrated polyphenolic compound in the fruit cortex of the apples from the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' segregating population. moreover, chlorogenic acid has a strong antioxidant activity, which makes it of primary importance for the health benefit of apple. hct and hqt have been demonstrated to contribute to the synthesis of chlorogenic acid in coffee  <cit>  and artichoke  <cit> . nevertheless, the hct and hqt genes remain to be described in apple and further work is required to confirm the involvement of these genes and their variants, to determine the fruit concentration of chlorogenic acid. this includes developing a hct/hqt marker for 'royal gala' to confirm that the qtl is strongly linked to this trait and studying these genes' expression during fruit development of cultivars with varying concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids.

the large effect lg  <dig> qtl cluster controlling the concentrations of fruit catechin, epicatechin, procyanidin oligomers and procyanidin b <dig> co-locates with lar <dig>  a candidate gene encoding the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of leucoanthocyanidins into catechin, upstream in the biosynthetic pathway of polymerised procyanidins . twelve genes coding for transcription factors of several classes that could possibly regulate lar <dig> are also located within this genomic region. further work is required to determine whether the effect is through changes in gene regulation or through changes in the biochemical functionality of the enzyme encoded by lar <dig>  to this end, we have initiated a study of the pattern of lar <dig> expression in extreme phenotypes in the mapping population as well as in a range of apple germplasm accessions. lar <dig> was demonstrated to be expressed in green and red skin of 'cripp's red' during fruit development  <cit> , with higher expression at the early stage of fruit development. however, this study was carried out only in one cultivar. in addition to lar <dig>  mrna expression of the transcription factors located in the qtl intervals will be carried out in our study. a control of flavanol compounds concentration by lar <dig> would contrast with the case of anthocyanin content, where it has been shown that control is exerted at the transcription level  <cit> , through activation of the enzymes of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway by myb <dig>  through a wd40-bhlh-myb protein complex. our favoured hypothesis is that the mutation is in the promoter region of lar <dig>  in a site recognised by the transcription factors regulating it. we believe that it is likely that the variation is not a complete loss of function of lar <dig>  as tannins have a recognized role in the response of plants to biotic and abiotic stress and although there is another copy of the lar gene  located on lg <dig>  it not appear co-locate with any flavanol qtl.

while our qtl mapping study does not provide definitive proof that lar <dig> controls the variation in the concentration of flavanols in the fruit cortex and skin, recent functional evidence using gene silencing of mdans strengthens this hypothesis. ans uses leucoanthocyanidins in competition with lar and synthesizes anthocyanidins that are converted into either anthocyanins via ufgt or epicatechin via anr. the silencing of mdans suppressed red colouration of a red-leaved apple cultivar and significantly increased the concentrations of other polyphenolic compounds, such as hydroxycinnamic acids, catechin and epicatechin in the transgenic plants  <cit> . while ans is not involved in the synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acids, we found that it co-locates with a qtl for q-coumaroyl quinic acid. although this qtl was only found in  <dig>  our results suggest that ans controls this trait variation. the results of szankowski and colleagues suggested an alternative pathway for the synthesis of epicatechin by epimerisation or by non-stereospecific depolymerisation of procyanidin oligomers  <cit> . our findings that epicatechin and catechin are both positively correlated , that the qtls for both compounds co-locate with lar <dig> and that the alleles of lar <dig> have the same effect for concentrations of both compounds reinforce the hypothesis by szankowski and colleagues of an alternative pathway for epicatechin.

the allele-specific genetic marker developed from lar <dig> is an excellent candidate for use in marker assisted selection for increased flavanol content, as the lg  <dig> qtl is stable across years and present in parental maps of 'braeburn' and 'royal gala', cultivars which play a significant role in the new zealand and other apple breeding programmes internationally. furthermore a similarly located qtl was identified in a segregating population from a 'prima' × 'fiesta' cross , indicating that the lg  <dig> qtl is carried by a range of other commercial apple cultivars that are used as breeding parents. the use of this gene-based marker for selection for fruit flavanol content is particularly important, because phytochemical compounds are not usually measured by breeders when they perform seedling phenotype assessment during the initial steps of selection that involve controlled crosses over one on more generations, but are only evaluated in released commercial cultivars, when it is too late to influence the final breeding outcome. we suggest that the lar <dig> marker should be screened over the parents for the original cross, as well as progeny from all generations, to ensure that breeding parents at all stages carry either or both favourable alleles of lar <dig> 

in addition, it is useful to investigate the links between flavanol concentration and current breeding traits. while flavanols have been suggested to be beneficial to human health as a source of antioxidants, they are also associated with astringency, which is not preferred by consumers. we are hence planning an organoleptic analysis of fruit from the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' population to determine whether astringency is correlated with the flavanol concentration. it is known that the lg  <dig> qtl cluster co-locates with a major locus for fruit acidity  identified from a 'prima' × 'fiesta' population  <cit>  and that acidity is important in determining consumer preferences  <cit> . in addition, qtls for loss of fruit firmness during storage and date of budbreak have been mapped to the same region of lg  <dig> in the 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' population . there is thus a real risk of selecting for a mix of positive and negative traits if the lar <dig> gene marker is used in isolation. identification of the functional allele of gene markers for each trait mapping to this region  will enable selection of the few genetically elite progeny that carry the most desirable combination of traits from large breeding populations.

CONCLUSIONS
we have detected stable qtls for polyphenolic antioxidant content in apple and have provided strong evidence that a polymorphism linked to a biosynthetic enzyme for flavanols  controls the concentration of flavanols in the fruit skin and cortex, and evidence that a polymorphism linked to hqt/hct may control the concentrations of chlorogenic acid. these candidate gene-derived markers have potential to facilitate the development of new apple cultivars bearing fruit with increased concentrations of a range of polyphenolic compounds with human health-benefit.
