BACKGROUND
lyme borreliosis has been recognized as the one of most common vector-borne diseases in the world. the disease was first reported in the usa by steere in  <dig>  subsequently its clinical manifestations were described by a scholar in yale university in  <dig>  and named lyme disease in  <dig>  <cit> . burgdorfer and his colleagues isolated a spirochete and confirmed it as the causative agent of lyme disease  <cit> . the spirochaete was formally named borrelia burgdorferi in  <dig>  <cit> .

lyme disease is distributed in over  <dig> countries and regions of asia, europe, america, africa and oceania, with more than  <dig>  million clinical cases per year  <cit> . in the usa, it is particularly severe with approximately 20- <dig> cases per  <dig>   <cit> . the number of cases is increasing, and the disease was listed as a key target for prevention and control by who in  <dig>  <cit> .

in china, the disease was first identified in the forest regions of hailin county in heilongjiang province in  <dig>  <cit> . liang and zhang latter confirmed that three b. burgdorferi isolates from the region caused lyme disease  <cit> . to date, serological investigations have confirmed that lyme disease is present in more than  <dig> provinces and autonomous regions, and more than  <dig> isolates of b. burgdorferi have been recovered from patients, ticks or animals in  <dig> provinces and autonomous regions  <cit> , especially in the northeast forest areas. the prevalence of lyme disease correlates with the geographic distribution and activity of vector ticks  <cit> . of the  <dig> species of ticks identified in china, lyme disease pathogens have been isolated from  <dig> ixodid ticks, including ixodes persulcatus, i. granulatus, i. acutitarsus, h. longicornis, h. bispinosa, h. concinna, h. formosensis, boophilus microplus and dermacentor silvarum <cit> .

the b. burgdorferi sensu lato complex comprises at least  <dig> species, b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. garinii, b. afzelii, b. lusitaniae, b. valaisiana, b. bissettii, b. andersonii, b. japonica, b. tanukii, b. turdi, b. sinica, b. spielmanii and b. californiensis. the following five species of b. burgdorferi have been isolated from ticks: b. burgdorferi sensu stricto , b. garinii , b. afzelii , b. lusitaniae  and b. valaisiana   <cit> .

in this study, we developed a reverse line blot  to detect and differentiate  <dig> b. burgdorferi sensu lato species on the basis of the variable spacer region regions between 5s and 23s rrna genes sequences. we then used the rlb to investigate the distribution and prevalence of b. burgdorferi sensu lato in china.

RESULTS
specificity of the rlb
amplification of the 5s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer was performed by nested pcr on four isolates . the primers specifically amplified the spacer region between 5s-23srrna genes sequence from borrelia and no cross-reaction occurred with dnas from m. pneumoniae, c. psittasi, anaplasma. marginale and a. ovis. all probes bound to their respective target sequence only; no cross reaction was observed at dilutions used, resulting in the clear recognition of individual strains, species, or groups. each of the  <dig> b. burgdorferi species was identified by one of the oligonucleotide probes . isolate bo <dig> was identified by two oligonucleotide probes: sl , and a specific probe recognizing af , isolate b <dig> was identified by two oligonucleotides probes: the sl , and a specific probe recognizing ss . isolates sz, t <dig>  pbr,  <dig>  ip <dig> and tn were recognized by two oligonucleotides as well: sl , and a specific probe recognizing ga . isolate vs <dig> was identified by two oligonucleotide probes: sl , and a specific probe recognizing vs , no signal was detected from genomic dna of m. pneumoniae, c. psittasi, a. marginale and a. ovis, or water .

comparison of sensitivity of nested pcr and rlb
sensitivity of the rlb was assessed using  <dig> fold diluted genomic dna  of b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. garinii, b. afzelii, and b. valaisiana. the rlb system was capable of detecting 1pg of b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. afzelii, dna and  <dig> pg of b. garinii, b. valaisiana dna. the detection level of the nested pcr carried out in parallel was also restricted to about 1pg~ <dig> pg . unlike the nested pcr, the rlb was able to identify which species b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. garinii or b. afzelii, the tick was infected with.

detection of b. burgdorferi sensu lato in ticks collected from sheep and cattle in china
the prevalence of each b. burgdorferi species was identified by rlb and pcr . the number of samples in which b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. garinii, b. afzelii, or b. valaisiana alone were detected were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  respectively , and 7%  were mixed infections and mainly in northern china. for the positive samples from southern china, it was found that the majority  of them were infected with b. burgdorfei sensu stricto, while b. garinii was dominant  in the positive samples from northern china. the results have revealed that most of the positive samples were infected by b. burgdorfei sensu stricto, b. garinii and/or b. afzelii. sixty-nine samples ,  <dig> samples  and  <dig> sample  were detected from dermacentor, haemaphysalis and boophilus, which belonged to b. valaisiana.

discussion
lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by borrelia. animals such as cattle, sheep, horses, dogs and rats can be infected by the pathogen, and in most cases, play a role as reservoirs with varied clinical symptoms  <cit> . lyme disease spirochetes have been isolated and detected from the following tick vectors: ixodes persulcatus, i. crenulatus, haemaphysalis longicornis, h. japonica, boophilus microplus, dermacentor silvarum and d. nuttalli  <cit> . the main mode of transmission is via the salivary gland when infected ticks feed on mammalian hosts. the infection rate of i. persulcatus, i. granulates and h. bispinosa were 40%-50%, 16%-40% and 24% respectively in north of china, suggesting that i. persulcatus is the principal vector of lyme disease spirochete in northern china, while i. granulates and h. bispinosa are the main vectors in the south of china  <cit> .

although lyme disease was found more than  <dig> years ago in china, knowledge of the epidemiology of the causative organism in the tick vectors is limited. we therefore considered that it would be very useful to develop a validated method to detect all four lyme disease pathogens associated with ticks to better understand the epidemiology of the disease in different regions of china.

the rlb assay was here developed into a useful diagnostic tool to simultaneously detect and differentiate b. burgdorferi subspecies in ticks. each species can be identified by a species-specific oligonucleotide probe using a line-blotter apparatus which is quickly becoming a standard molecular tool for diagnostic and epidemiological studies in an increasing number of laboratories all over the world. in this study, a rlb assay was established based on the spacer region between 5s and 23s rrna genes of b. burgdorferi senso lato. b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b garinii, b. afzelii, and b. valaisiana as decribed barandika et al  <cit> . all four borrelia species could be differentiated with  <dig> species-specific oligonucleotides while the oligonucleotide probe sl designed specifically for the genera of b. burgdorferi hybridized with all  <dig> species. any new species or genotype that may present would therefore be detected by the si probe but not by the species-specific probes. meanwhile, in order to confirm whether there was false positives, the sequence analysis of  <dig> samples was conducted for amplicons  from these samples by random sampling. in all cases, it was found that the fragment was about  <dig> bp and 250bp, and the homology was  <dig> % and  <dig> % with the 5s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region gene of b. burgdorferi by dnastar analysis, suggesting that the ticks were infected by b. burgdorferi sensu lato. the rlb was a reliable diagnostic tool and when pcr amplification steps were included, the specificity was further improved. different strains can be detected concurrently, and coinfection of different strains of b. burgdorferi sensu lato could be distinguished.

we have shown here that the infection rate of borrelia spirochaetes in ticks varies considerably between different geographical regions. b. burgdorferi sensu stricto is found more frequently in the south  and b. garinii more frequently in the northeast  and northwest , this is not accordance with the recent reports  <cit> . our results do not agree with previous findings which suggest that b. afzelii is the dominant species in northeast china. however, in the present study, the b. afzelii infection rate of samples from the north was lower than those samples infected with b. garinii and b. burgdorferi sensu stricto. although the infection rate of ticks with b. afzelii was 19%, which was much higher than that previously reported  <cit> , the low infection rate of b. afzelii might be associated with the limited number of ticks collected from field. another explanation could be that the tick infection rate of each of the four borrelia varies among samples from different regions, and it is possible that samples in this study were collected from areas where the tick infection rate of b. afzelii is lower.

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which lyme disease species of b. burgdorferi sensu lato were detected by rlb in field ticks in china. the prevalence and distribution of borrelia spirochaetes in ticks are key factors for risk assessment of lyme borreliosis. from our results, it could be seen that b. garinii is the dominant species and widely distributed in china, which agrees with the previous data  <cit> . b. afzelii and b. burgdorferi sensu stricto have been found only in a limited number of ticks, however, the tick infection rate with b. burgdorferi sensu stricto was higher than that of b. afzelii, which is different from previously reported.

b. valaisiana has only been isolated from rats from guizhou province in china and it has been assumed that distribution of b. valaisiana is confined to the southwest of china  <cit> . in this study b. valaisiana was detected in relatively high levels in the samples from northeast china . masuzawa et al  <cit>  have confirmed that b. valaisiana is present in korea which is geographically very close to northeast china. the prevalence of b. valaisiana varied among our study sites. it could be inferred that the distribution of b. valaisiana is much wider than originally thought. previous reports suggested that b. valaisiana was more difficult to isolate from clinically diagnosed cases of lyme borreliosis than genomospecies b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. afzelii and b. garinii  <cit> . as most of the current prevalence data on lyme disease are from human medical institutions and identification of borrelia is based on the isolation, it is reasonable to believe that in northeast china, b. valaisiana is more prevalent but may be misdiagnosed due to the difficulty of isolation of the pathogen.

we collected samples of four genera of ticks from sheep and cattle, which were haemaphysalis , boophilus , rhipicephalus  and dermacentor  from seven regions, where the primary forests are preserved. the infection rates of the four genera of ticks with the four species of borrelia burgdorferi l were 15%, 34%, 13% and  <dig> % , 54%, 28%, 39% and  <dig> % ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 0% , and 21%, 39%, 19% and 22% ; while the infection rates detected by pcr were 6% , 32% , 31%  and 4%   <cit> . recently, richter and matuschka  have found that although about a quarter of i. ricinus ticks questing on the pasture were infected by spirochetes, the positive rate of the ticks collected from goats and cattle was much lower, and no molted ticks that had previously engorged or repletion on ruminant harbored lyme disease spirochetes  <cit> . the authors also concluded that the spirochetes are cleared from i. ricinus ticks during feeding on ruminants. to confirm this hypothesis, more engorged ticks of these four species should be collected to test the status of spirochete infection of their offspring. in the present study, the results indicated that the positive detection rates of the rlb technique were higher than that by pcr. we further confirmed the sensitivity of the rlb, and the detection results of the infection state of three genera of ticks are also consistent with two methods on the whole, except for the results with rhipicephalus. it has been still unknown yet why the positive rate by pcr was higher than by rlb with the rhipicephalus samples. our data suggests that the infection rate of different genera of ticks is also variable. however, the differences in infection rates among tick species were not statistically significant, and these differences could be due to geographical and seasonal variations of tick and host populations rather than tick vector competence. because the ticks were collected from animals which could have been already infected with borrelia burgdorferi, we can therefore only say that these ticks are potential vectors. the data showed the infection rate of boophilus with borrelia was relatively high and this species might play a role in transmission of lyme diseases  <cit> . as boophilus does not readily attach to humans, it could transmit the pathogen between cattle and perhaps sheep, and these infected animals would become reservoirs for other tick species which will attach to humans. these results are consistent with previous studies and confirm that boophilus plays an important role in lyme disease transmission amongst livestock. it has been reported that haemaphysalis and dermacentor are the vectors of lyme disease  <cit>  yet rhipicephalus spp. have not previously been confirmed as vectors. in this study, we detected borrelia burgdorferi in rhipicephalus spp suggesting that rhipicephalus spp. might transmit borrelia burgdorferi. in the present study, it was not possible to confirm that these four genera of ticks were capable of transmitting borrelia sporochaetes, and the competence of the ticks as vector will need to be determined by further experimental study.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports development of a rlb assay that is able to detect  <dig> species of b. burgdorferi sensu lato in field ticks simultaneously. the genomic dna of b. burdorferi senso stricto and b. afzelii, b. garinii and b. valaisiana have been detected in samples prepared from  <dig> genera of ticks collected from seven different areas in china. these findings extend the knowledge of the epidemiology of borrelia burgdorferi and its possible transmission by adult ticks in china. rlb is a powerful tool for such epidemiological studies and for further investigation of the association between tick vectors b. burgdorferi sensu lato species and clinical manifestations of lyme disease. it can also be used for screening ticks and can easily be expanded to include additional borrelia species. we also demonstrated that rhipicephalus spps are the potential vectors of borrelia burgdorferi. several tick species may be involved in the transmission of borrelia in china and the high infection rate suggests that there is a high risk of human infection. little is known of the epidemiology, diagnosis and control of lyme borreliosis in livestock, and more research is needed.
