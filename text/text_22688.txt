BACKGROUND
amyloid precursor protein  is a key molecule in alzheimer disease  by the generation of its metabolites  <cit> . app at the cell surface is required for its cleavages. beside its cleavages, app can receive signals transduced through go to induce neuronal migration and outgrowth, synapse differentiation at the neuro-muscular junction in drosophila or cell death  <cit> . the generation of app cleavages following this signaling has not been reported. some molecules like reelin, able to induce neurite outgrowth in primary neurons, promote a rapid traffic of app to the cell surface  <cit> . interestingly, this increase of app at the cell surface is required for reelin-induced neurite outgrowth suggesting that app at the cell surface triggers some signaling in this model  <cit> . consequently, app trafficking to the cell surface appears crucial, but its mechanisms remain poorly investigated. app is a fast axonal transported protein along the microtubules, involving kinesin and rab <dig> gtpase activity  <cit> . the role of app binding with its partners either in the n or in the c-terminal domains has been poorly investigated and some of these interactions could be involved in app trafficking. the neuronal sorting protein-related receptor sorla/lr <dig>  a retromer-associated protein, interacts with the app carbohydrate-linked domain and retains app in golgi  <cit> . sortilin, a vps10p-domain receptor, related to sorla interacts with both the extracellular and intracellular domains of app in neurites and regulates app trafficking to lysosomes and lipid rafts  <cit> . mint proteins bind app and adp-ribosylation factors suggesting that mint proteins can regulate vesicular trafficking of app and its endocytosis  <cit> . recently, mint <dig> adaptor has been shown necessary for export of app from the golgi to a lamp1+ compartment  <cit> . ap- <dig> has been shown to be important for the app export from the golgi in hela cells  <cit> . most of app partners are localized in the distal part of the c-terminal domain, probably due to its structure having two type i reverse turns, the first one at the tppee sequence  <cit> . consequently, the app cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain may be less accessible to partners unless it is unmasked after caspase cleavage. the pat <dig>  also called appbp <dig>  or ara <dig> interacting with the app cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain and bearing repeat homologies to kinesin light chains has been reported to increase app trafficking to the cell surface when co-transfected with app in cos cells  <cit> . pat <dig> is expressed in many human tissues at variable levels and in many cell lines  <cit> . more recently, a polymorphism of the pat1/appbp <dig> gene was shown at the origin of sequence differences in pat <dig>  ara <dig> and appbp <dig>  <cit> . pat1a is 99% identical to pat <dig> and completely identical to appbp <dig>  ara <dig> is  <dig> % identical to pat <dig>  <cit> . pat1a when overexpressed in neuroblastoma cells with app, induces an increase of app at the cell surface  <cit> . we have previously shown that overexpression of the app-pat <dig> binding domain in the cytoplasm of primary neurons through the help of an internalization vector, leads to a very rapid increase of app at the cell surface bound to a low amount of pat <dig> triggering a cell death signal  <cit> . in this model, pat <dig> was trapped by the app-pat <dig> binding domain disrupting pat <dig> from its interactions with endogenous app, suggesting that the binding of pat <dig> with endogenous app prevents its trafficking to the cell surface. in order to address the role of pat <dig> in app trafficking at the cell surface in primary neurons, we down and up-regulated pat <dig> and observed that app at the cell surface is dependent on a low amount of pat <dig> suggesting that the binding of pat <dig> to app keeps app in the cytoplasm.

RESULTS
colocalization of app and pat <dig> is poorly present at the cell surface of neurons
we first observed in primary cortical neurons that paraformaldehyde  fixation at 4% caused little permeabilization at the cell surface allowing some pat <dig> detection under the cell surface while additional permeabilization by  <dig> % triton x  <dig> allowed to detect more pat <dig> in the cytoplasm . the giantin a golgi marker is detected after additional permeabilization with  <dig> % triton x  <dig> only.figure  <dig> 
app and pat <dig> colocalize poorly at the cell surface of primary neurons. a) neurons at  <dig> div were fixed in pfa 4% for 30 min . after fixation, an additional permeabilization in  <dig> % triton x  <dig> was performed . in both cases cells were immunolabeled for giantin or pat <dig>  immunocytochemistry was analyzed by confocal microscopy. one representative immunocytochemical staining out of  <dig> independent experiments is presented. scale bar: 10 μm. b) app and pat <dig> double immunolabeling was performed in neurons at  <dig> div fixed with pfa 4% only  and followed by  <dig> % triton x  <dig> . anti-app cter polyclonal and monoclonal pat <dig> antibodies were used as primary antibodies. pearson’s coefficient was evaluated following confocal microscopy analyses and quantifications in volocity software. data presented are the mean ± sem of  <dig> independent experiments. c) ratio of app to pat <dig> before  and after immunoprecipitation of app in total extracts  and after cell surface biotinylation . immunoprecipitation of app was performed with the anti-app cter polyclonal antibody.  <dig>  cells at  <dig> div were used for each condition. 40 μg of cell extracts before immunoprecipitation were loaded . control immunoprecipitation in absence of primary antibody is presented . detection of app in western blotting was performed using the anti-app-nter a <dig> antibody. data presented are the mean ± sem of  <dig> independent experiments. representative immunoblot and histogram of the ratio of app to pat <dig> in arbitrary units  are presented.



pat <dig> was detected close to the cell surface of soma and neurites. double immunostaining for app and pat <dig>  performed after 4% pfa fixation only, reveal little co-localization close to the cell surface contrary to what observed in the cytoplasm when the fixed cells were then permeabilized with  <dig> % triton x  <dig>  pearson’s coefficient shows a significant difference  between the colocalization of app and pat <dig> detected after fixation in pfa only and the colocalization observed when the fixation is followed by an additional permeabilization in triton x  <dig> .

immunoprecipitation of app from total neuronal extracts show co-immunoprecipitation of pat <dig> as expected. in that case the ratio of app to pat <dig>  was close to that observed in lysates before immunoprecipitation . after cell surface biotinylation this ratio was significantly higher   . these data confirm that at cell surface the amount of pat <dig> attached to app is lower than in the cytoplasm.

down and up-regulation of pat <dig> respectively increases and decreases app at the cell surface of neurons
in order to investigate if pat <dig> levels can modulate the trafficking of app to the cell surface we down and up-regulated pat <dig>  down-regulation of pat <dig> was performed by the help of specific sirnas. the decrease of pat <dig> level in primary neurons was checked 66 h after pat <dig> sirnas addition both by immunocytochemical staining for pat <dig> without triton x  <dig> and immunoblots from cell extracts . a significant decrease of pat <dig> level was observed in primary neurons treated with pat <dig> sirnas for 66 h comparatively to control  cells in absence of treatment  while no difference of pat <dig> levels was observed using gapdh sirnas, as control sirnas  . the down-regulation of pat <dig> or gapdh did not modify the level of total app in neuronal extracts .figure  <dig> 
down-regulation of pat <dig> increases app at the cell surface of primary neurons. neurons at  <dig> div were treated with either pat <dig> sirnas or gapdh sirnas comparatively to control cells  in absence of treatment. a-b: after 66 h the cells were fixed and processed for pat <dig> immunocytodetection  or extracted for western blots .  immunocytochemistry was analyzed by confocal microscopy and quantified by image j. data are expressed in integrated density/cell in arbitrary units . two representative immunolabelings of pat <dig> of each condition are presented.  40 μg of cell extracts were loaded for western blotting. the level of pat <dig> or of app reported to actin was expressed in arbitrary units . data in a and b are the mean ± sem of  <dig> independent experiments and of  <dig> experiments for right panel in b. c-d: after 66 h of pat <dig> sirnas or gapdh sirnas, the cells were fixed by and processed for app immunodetection  or for cell surface biotinylation .  app immunocytochemistry was analyzed by confocal microscopy and quantified with image j. data are expressed in integrated density/cell in arbitray units . three representative images of each condition are presented.  cell surface biotinylation was performed on  <dig> cells. ncam was used as internal control of membrane loading for cell surface biotinylation. the level of app in biotinylated membranes was reported to ncam and expressed in arbitrary units . data are the mean ± sem of  <dig> independent experiments. in the whole figure immunocytochemistry was performed using the anti-app-nter a <dig> antibody. the anti-app cter polyclonal antibody was used for western blotting in 2b  and the anti-app-nter a <dig> antibody was used in 2d. scale bar: 10 μm.



the localization of app in cortical neurons was checked in primary neuronal culture treated with pat <dig> sirnas for 66 h. confocal analyses of immunocytochemical app detection in absence of triton x  <dig> showed a significant increase of app at the cell surface in presence of low levels of pat <dig> . this increase of app was present both in soma and neurites . cell surface biotinylation performed after 66 h of pat <dig> sirnas treatment confirmed this app increase at the cell surface  . as total app was not modified in pat <dig> sirnas conditions , these data suggest that the app increase at the cell surface is induced by low levels of pat <dig> and not by changes in total app levels. no difference of app at the cell surface was observed when the neurons were treated with gapdh sirnas  . we did not observe cell death in neurons treated with pat <dig> sirnas, nor with gapdh sirnas, suggesting that the increase of app at the cell surface, in conditions of pat <dig> low levels did not induce cell death .figure  <dig>

conversely, up-regulation of pat <dig> was performed by transfection of pat1-myc in primary cortical neurons. then, the cells were fixed 24 h later, and processed for myc and app double immunolabeling. cells overexpressing pat1-myc have little app at the cell surface as observed by immunolabeling performed after pfa fixation in absence of any further permeabilization . however when immunolabeling was performed in conditions of additional permeabilization with triton x  <dig>  more endogenous app within the cytoplasm colocalized with pat1-myc in transfected cells , as indicated by pearson’s coefficient. a significant increase of pearson’s coefficient  was observed in conditions of additional permeabilization comparatively to conditions of pfa fixation only . cell surface biotinylation of transfected neurons showed a significant lower ratio of app/ncam than in the control conditions, confirming immunocytochemical data  . the total app level detected in transfected cells by immunolabeling in conditions of additional permeabilization with triton x  <dig>  was not significantly different to that of non-transfected cells suggesting that the overexpression of pat1-myc does not reduce the total level of app . consequently, the decrease of app at the cell surface is induced by the overexpression of pat1-myc and not by changes in app total levels under these conditions.figure  <dig> 
up-regulation of pat <dig> in primary neurons results in a strong colocalization with app in the cytoplasm but not at the cell surface. a-b. pat1-myc was overexpressed by transfection in primary neurons at  <dig> div. 24 h later cells were fixed by pfa 4% only  or followed by  <dig> % triton x  <dig> . immunolabeling for pat1-myc  and endogenous app  was performed and analyzed by confocal microscopy. two representative images in each condition are presented. in  immunolabeling was performed using the anti-myc tag polyclonal #06- <dig> and the anti-app-nter a <dig> antibody. in  the anti-myc tag mabe <dig> and the anti-app-cter polyclonal antibodies were used for immunolabeling. quantification of colocalization using volocity software was expressed by pearson’s coefficient . data presented are the mean ± sem of  <dig> independent experiments. quantification of total app in conditions of  <dig> % triton x  <dig> was performed in  <dig> transfected and  <dig> non-transfected cells  out of  <dig> independent experiments. data are expressed in integrated density / cell in arbitrary units  and represents the mean ± sem . scale bar: 10 μm. c) cell surface biotinylation was performed on pat1-myc overexpressed cells comparatively to control cells . experiments were performed on  <dig>  cells 24 h after transfection. ncam was used as internal control of membrane loading for cell surface biotinylation. the level of app in biotinylated membranes was reported to ncam and expressed in arbitrary units . data are the mean ± sem of  <dig> independent experiments. western blotting were performed using the anti-app-nter a <dig> and the anti-ncam antibodies.



the whole data suggest that pat <dig> slows down app trafficking to the cell surface.

discussion
using down and up-regulation of pat <dig> in primary neurons, we show here that pat <dig> is involved in app trafficking to the cell surface.

pat <dig> down-regulation through sirnas causes an increase of app at the cell surface while up-regulation of pat <dig> shows very little if any app close to the plasma membrane. pat <dig> down-regulation experiments fit with what we observed when pat <dig> was mislocalized by overexpressing the app-pat <dig> binding domain  <cit> . in that case, pat <dig> was attached to the app-pat <dig> binding domain in the cytoplasm detrimental to endogenous app. the binding of endogenous pat <dig> to the app-pat <dig> domain internalized through a cell permeable peptide led to a rapid increase of app at the cell surface, as early as one hour. in this case app migrating at cell surface had a very low level of pat <dig>  while the internalized app-pat <dig> binding domain was also able to interact in a tripartite interaction with app and pat <dig> in the cytoplasm. indeed, we showed that this increase of app and of its homolog amyloid precursor like protein  <dig>  at the cell surface induced a cell death signal with downstream events like translocation of set from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. in this model the level of pat <dig> still attached to app at the cell surface was lower than in control conditions, and probably lower than in pat <dig> sirnas conditions as well. in addition, we cannot exclude that other partners able to interact with pat <dig> were probably mislocalized with pat <dig> and could act in the cell death signal induced by the increase of app at the cell surface. in the present study, in conditions where pat <dig> was down-regulated by sirnas, app reached rapidly the cell surface, as if it was liberated from some anchor in the cytoplasm but did not induced cell death, probably because about 50% of pat <dig> was still present and not mislocalized. down-regulation using sirnas remains more stable contrary to the very transient efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides strategy which is useful for a rapid signal induced at the time of its highest efficiency, as we observed with the app-pat <dig> binding domain peptide but which can mask some events  <cit> . we don’t know precisely at what level of pat <dig> within the neuron, app starts to migrate to the cell surface. in control conditions, we observed here that the amount of pat <dig> interacting with app at the cell surface is lower than with the total level of app interacting mainly within the cytoplasm, meaning that at the cell surface pat <dig> is poorly required.

the down-regulation data obtained with pat <dig> sirnas fit with the pat <dig> up-regulation results, where little app reached the cell surface while it is present deeply in the cytoplasm co-localizing with pat <dig> probably by direct interaction. our data fit with what observed with ara67/pat <dig> which binds to androgen receptor in the cytoplasm of cell lines overexpressing these two partners suppressing the migration of androgen receptor to the nucleus and its transactivation  <cit> .

whether the ligands acting on a specific receptor and inducing an increase of app at the cell surface are related to a disruption of the interaction with pat <dig> remain to be elucidated. in the reelin signaling pathway the increase of app at the cell surface was also observed in presence of high levels of disabled- <dig>  the reelin signaling molecule, able to bind the app cytoplasmic distal domain  <cit> . as pat <dig> binds the app cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain, in pathological conditions where there is an increase of the neuronal app cleaved in its cytoplasmic domain by a caspase  <cit> , one can wonder if the uncleaved app migrates rapidly to the cell surface to trigger a cell death signal stimulating the deleterious effect.

previous report has shown that the anterograde transport of app was independent of its c-terminal domain but required the rab3gtpase activity for recruitment of kinesin 1c to vesicles containing app allowing to interact with microtubules  <cit> . nothing is known if rab3gtpase activity is necessary for the retrograde app trafficking as well as its trafficking to the cell surface. one cannot exclude that pat <dig> having several repeats of kinesin light chains and interacting with app prevents the app containing vesicles to move by competing with kinesin 1c in the interaction with microtubules  <cit> . our results contradict the data obtained in app and pat <dig> or pat1a double transfected cos and neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . pat <dig> binding domain to app has not been determined and as pat1/pat1a contains several repeats, it is possible that pat1/pat1a acts in a multipartite app interaction. in case of double transfected cells it would have been interesting to evaluate the ratio of pat1/pat1a to app at the cell surface and within the cytoplasm. the modulation of the level of endogenous pat <dig> in primary differentiated neurons could represent more physiological conditions.

in addition to cell signaling, increases of app at the cell surface may induce app cleavages. however, we could not establish an increase of app cleavages either in alpha or beta secretase in pat <dig> down-regulation conditions . this may be explained by low detectable amyloid products in our primary neurons.

since pat <dig> poorly binds app at the cell surface, it is possible that pat <dig> may have other partners and function. the role of pat <dig> in pathology has not been elucidated. it is highly expressed in breast cancers with poor diagnosis  <cit> , in ovarian adenocarcinoma tumors  <cit> , but also in neuroblastomas  <cit> , and desmoplastic medulloblastoma cerebellar tumors  <cit> . pat <dig> binds also to the c-terminal domain of the herpes simplex virus type  <dig> us <dig> gene product and probably this interaction plays a role in the intracellular movement of viral components  <cit> . changes in pat <dig> expression in alzheimer disease have not been yet investigated but could have consequences in app signaling and cleavages.

CONCLUSIONS
in primary cortical neurons app is poorly associated to its partner pat <dig> at the cell surface contrary to what observed in the cytoplasm. we used down and up-regulation of pat <dig> in primary neurons and observed that app respectively increases and decreases at the cell surface. the modulation of app at the cell surface through pat <dig> levels can represent a way to control the cell surface signaling events and app cleavages. these data contribute to the understanding of mechanisms involved in alzheimer disease.
