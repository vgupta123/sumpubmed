BACKGROUND
tobacco ringspot virus , a single-stranded bipartite rna virus, is one of the most destructive viral pathogens of soybean  merr.)  <cit> . soybean plants infected with trsv are generally stunted, leaflets may be dwarfed and rolled, buds may become brown, necrotic and brittle, and terminal buds may form a crook and die. plants infected at early developmental stages often produce undeveloped flowers that impact fertilization resulting in aborted pods and yield losses ranging from  <dig> to 100 %  <cit> . trsv is transmitted through infected seeds or by vectors, including the dagger nematode , grasshoppers , thrips  and tobacco flea beetles   <cit> . transmission by seed and nematodes may be the most common pathways of infection  <cit> . trsv has a broad host range that includes many plant genera, and has been reported on soybean in most soybean producing states in the usa and in australia, canada, the people’s republic of china, and russia  <cit> .

there are few options for managing trsv outbreaks. resistance to trsv has not been described for commercial soybean cultivars, and may not be available based on the absence of trsv resistance in a set of  <dig> lines that are the ancestors to most north american public cultivars  <cit> . in another study, trsv resistance was reported in wild soybean  as three out of  <dig> plant introductions  displayed only mild symptoms when infected by trsv  <cit> . no further studies have been conducted to determine the inheritance of the potential sources of resistance in g. soja. however, one study crossed the soybean cultivar young and pi <dig> and identified a major quantitative trait locus  that explained 82 % of the phenotypic variation of trsv resistance. this qtl was located on chromosome  <dig> between 25 mb to 28 mb between markers k644_ <dig> and satt <dig> based on williams <dig> assembly version  <dig>   <cit> . in addition, when arabidopsis thaliana  heynh. was inoculated with trsv, most ecotypes were tolerant to trsv, but some ecotypes, such as estland, displayed lethal systemic necrosis  <cit> , which resembled bud blight of soybean. an allele of ttr <dig> , which encodes a protein with toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor, nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat  domains was reported to control tolerance to trsv in a. thaliana  <cit> . comparison of protein sequence alignments between tolerant and sensitive a. thaliana ecotypes identified different amino acid residues in the lrr region between sensitive ttr <dig> and tolerant ttr <dig> alleles. when the trsv-tolerant a. thaliana ecotype col- <dig> was transformed with the ttr <dig> allele from the sensitive estland ecotype, the resulting plants were sensitive to trsv infection. in contrast, when col- <dig> was transformed with ttr <dig> that contained single amino acid substitutions at different locations, only l956s and k1124q escaped the necrosis symptoms, suggesting that the leucine  and lysine  residues in the ttr <dig> gene were needed for trsv sensitivity and for displaying lethal systemic necrosis  <cit> .

the genome-wide association study  is a statistical analysis that associates variation across the entire genome with phenotypes  <cit> . in the case of soybean, gwass have been used to identify loci associated with agronomic traits  <cit> , abiotic stress  <cit> , and disease resistance including phytophthora root rot   <cit> , sclerotinia stem rot  de bary) , soybean cyst nematode  , and sudden death syndrome   <cit> . with the availability of soysnp50k single nucleotide polymorphism  markers  <cit> , genomic information for over  <dig>  accessions in the usda soybean germplasm collection can be utilized to identify genes underlying many traits, including resistance or tolerance to trsv.

the goal of this study was to identify regions of the soybean genome associated with sensitivity to trsv infection based on a subset of the pis in the usda soybean germplasm collection. for these analyses,  <dig> soybean pis were phenotyped trsv sensitivity and gwas was performed, which identified a single locus associated with sensitivity to trsv infection. moreover, we applied genomic prediction to estimate trsv sensitivities for the unscreened  <dig>  soybean pis in the usda soybean germplasm collection, and evaluated the accuracy of genomic prediction. to our knowledge, this work constitutes the first gwas and genomic prediction study for trsv sensitivity in soybean.

RESULTS
sensitivity of soybean pis to trsv infection
all  <dig> soybean pis evaluated were susceptible to trsv and showed symptoms. at ten days post inoculation, most soybean plants infected with trsv were stunted and displayed a range of foliar symptoms . plants were separated into sensitivity categories of one to five based on the severity of their symptoms. plants that displayed terminal necrosis on the first or second trifoliates were classified as a sensitivity of five or four, respectively . plants classified as sensitivity three had necrotic spots in the first or second trifoliate that generally started at the leaf margin or had terminal necrosis of third trifoliates . plants with mosaic foliar symptoms on first trifoliates were categorized as sensitivity two  plants with sensitivities of one were slightly stunted with mild chlorosis . more than 50 % of the pis were classified as sensitivity four or five, and only  <dig> pis were classified as sensitivity one .fig.  <dig> sensitivity of soybean accessions to trsv infection. a decision tree for determining trsv sensitivities one to five. b red arrows indicate necrotic reactions on different trifoliates. when the first trifoliate became necrotic, plants were rated with a sensitivity of five. c necrosis of the second trifoliate at the bud stage typifies sensitivity four. d plants that had necrotic spots on first trifoliate leaves belonged to sensitivity three. e plants in sensitivity two displayed clear mosaic symptoms on the first trifoliate. f plants in sensitivity one were stunted with chlorosis. g the distribution of trsv sensitivity on  <dig> soybean accessions



gwas to identify qtl associated with sensitivity to trsv
the bayesian information criterion -based model selection procedure  <cit>  indicated that no principal components  were required to control for population structure in the gwas model . this result underscored our findings that the principal component analysis did not detect distinct subpopulations among the selected  <dig> soybean pis . therefore, no pc was included, but a heatmap of the kinship matrix with genetic relatedness among the  <dig> soybean pis  was included in the mixed linear model for gwas. since the observed and expected p-values differed substantially only for a few snps, the quantile-quantile  plot supported the appropriateness of the gwas model . the gwas identified a single locus associated with trsv sensitivity that exceeded the bonferroni-corrected α =  <dig>  threshold on chromosome  <dig> . four snps in this region were significant at a 1 % false discovery rate . individually, these snps accounted for  <dig> to 4 % of the variance in the gwas model. although most of the significant snps were located within a genomic region on chromosome  <dig>  one snp on chromosome  <dig> was significantly associated with trsv sensitivity at 5 % fdr . to confirm and detect other potential minor signals, the gwas was reran with the most significant snp on chromosome  <dig>  included as a covariate. the resulting qq-plot showed that the observed p-values followed the expected p-values , and no additional snps identified at 5 % fdr . the result indicated that fixation of ss <dig> as a covariate explained most of the genetic contribution to the overall phenotypic variation and suggested only one locus on chromosome  <dig> was responsible for trsv sensitivity in soybean. the four snps displaying peak associations with trsv sensitivity in the initial gwas defined a genomic region of approximately 130 kb between  <dig> ,749 bp to  <dig> ,313 bp on chromosome  <dig> . within this region, there were two candidate genes  that may be involved in plant defense responses. both encode leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases  .table  <dig> bayesian information criterion -based model selection. the model with the largest bic value is optimal

genomic prediction
because a single genomic region on chromosome  <dig> associated with trsv sensitivity, the mean separation of trsv sensitivity at each of the four most significantly associated snps were tested to determine if marker-assisted selection would aid in breeding for reduced sensitivity to trsv infection. the results suggested strong overlaps in these distributions , and the correlation between genotypes of each snp to the rated trsv sensitivity resulted in low significant  correlations . we then tested if genomic selection would provide a better prediction and applied gapit and rrblup to perform cross-validation  <cit> . the results of the five-fold cross-validation without a covariate in the model resulted in significant correlations  for both gapit and rrblup. when the most significant snp, ss <dig>  was fixed as a covariate in the model, the correlation coefficient was reduced for gapit  but not rrblup  . these results indicated that genomic prediction without including a covariate might provide a better estimate for the unscreened soybean accessions in the usda soybean germplasm collection. we subsequently conducted genomic prediction by splitting the unscreened  <dig>  soybean pis into  <dig> groups to increase computational speed and acquired an average blup for each of the  <dig>  soybean pis. the blups of the unscreened soybean pis was sigmoidal with continuous values while the blup of the training subpopulations were centered around −  <dig> ,− <dig> ,− <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  that corresponded to genomic estimated breeding values  of one to five, respectively . the distribution of blups and gebvs for the  <dig>  unscreened soybean pis suggested none was close to pis in the trsv sensitivity one from the training population . we then phenotyped an additional  <dig> pis selected from the predicted gebv distribution for sensitivity to trsv in order to evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction . the gebv showed that the trsv sensitivities of the  <dig> pis:  <dig> pis with trsv sensitivities of two ,  <dig> pis with trsv sensitivities of three ,  <dig> pis with trsv sensitivities of four , and  <dig> pis with trsv sensitivities of five . the rated trsv sensitivity was correlated  to gebvs obtained from both gapit and rrblup . however, the accuracy of genomic prediction tended to be divergent in the lower ratings but more reliable toward the higher sensitivity ratings. that is, most plants with predicted sensitivity ratings of five and four had actual sensitivity ratings of five and four, but accessions with a predicted sensitivity rating of two had actual sensitivity ratings that ranged from one to four .fig.  <dig> mean separation by significant snps and cross-validation by gapit and rrblup. a distribution of trsv sensitivity by each significant snp genotype showed strong overlap between the sensitivity scales. b five-fold cross-validation with or without the most significant snp, ss <dig>  as the covariate. cross-validation was evaluated by gapit and rrblup. in general, the correlation of training and validating population dropped slightly when the covariate was included in the model for both gapit and rrblup

discussion
in this study,  <dig> of the  <dig>  soybean pis in the usda soybean germplasm collection were evaluated for their responses to trsv inoculation. although no trsv-immune accessions were observed, 43 % of the accessions did not display bud blight, the most severe symptom. a gwas identified a single genomic region on chromosome  <dig> strongly associated with trsv sensitivity using the unified mixed linear model  <cit>  in the gapit package  <cit> , which identified a 130 kb chromosome  <dig> interval that contains glyma02g <dig> and glyma02g <dig>  two candidate lrr-rlk genes.

genes of the lrr-rlk type are well known for their involvement in pathogen-associated molecular pattern -triggered immunity . classical examples are the ligand-dependent receptor flagellin sensing <dig>  that recognizes bacterial flagellin and ef-tu receptor  that recognizes ef-tu. after recognizing the extracellular pamp, another rlk co-receptor  forms a complex with fls <dig> or efr and activates downstream pti defense responses  <cit> . one of the lrr-rlk genes from a. thaliana, erecta, is particularly interesting for its involvement in developmental processes in multiple tissue types, including aerial organs, epidermal tissue, pedicels, and floral primordia, as well as its function in controlling resistance against the bacterial pathogen ralstonia solanacearum  yabuuchi  <cit> , fungal pathogen plectosphaerella cucumerina  arx and oomycete pathogen pythium irregular buisman  <cit> . it has been proposed that erecta-dependent resistance against necrotrophic p. cucumerina is linked to regulation plant cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> .

in addition to erecta that is associated with bacterial and fungal resistance, nuclear shuttle proteins  from viruses in the geminiviridae have been reported to interact with a. thaliana nsp-interacting kinase <dig> , which also belongs to the lrr-rlk protein family  <cit> . unlike trsv, viruses in the geminiviridae have bipartite circular single-stranded dna genomes . while dna-a of geminiviridae encode proteins involved in replication, transcription, and encapsidation, dna-b encodes two proteins, nsp and a movement protein. the nsp inhibits the kinase activity of nik <dig> by binding to the kinase active site and activation loop, which contains an essential threonine residue . nik <dig> deletion mutants displayed enhanced susceptibility to viruses in the geminiviridae  <cit> , and ectopic expression of a nonphosphorylatable nik <dig> in the nik <dig> deletion mutant failed to rescue the enhanced virus susceptibility  <cit> . blocking of t <dig> eliminated its kinase activity and abolished the phosphorylation of a protein that moves from cytosol to the nucleus when phosphorylated, where it interacts with a nucleus-located transcription factor to down regulate translation processes that eventually suppress viral replication  <cit> . under the proposed mechanism, nik <dig> serves as a target to nsp for suppressing host defense responses. the discoveries of how nik <dig> is involved in controlling plant susceptibility to geminiviruses may underline how one or two soybean lrr-rlk genes in the chromosome  <dig> region harboring peak genomic associations with trsv sensitivity could control the disease responses to trsv. if these two lrr-rlk genes are confirmed to play a biological role in regulating trsv sensitivity, it may imply that these soybean lrr-rlk are virulence targets for trsv that control sensitivity rather than resistance, if the mechanism of the interactions of soybean lrr-rlk proteins with trsv are similar to nik <dig> with geminiviruses. further studies focused on comparing the protein sequences of the two lrr-rlk genes from soybean pis with different sensitivity levels to trsv may reveal if any amino acid polymorphism indeed associate with these levels of sensitivity. in addition, characterization of the putative viral component and the mechanism of interaction may improve our understanding on how soybean sensitivity to trsv is controlled.

genomic prediction has become a powerful tool for rapidly predicting plant phenotypes based on genome-wide marker information. this approach has great potential to accelerate plant breeding cycles because it requires fewer generations of selection compared to phenotype-based breeding approaches  <cit> . a recent review on “next generation breeding” illustrated how next generation sequencing will be used to more quickly improve crop productivity  <cit> . multiple genomic prediction models have been developed with similar accuracies  <cit> , and in our study, we applied the compressed blup approach in the gapit r package  <cit>  and the ridge regression blup in the rrblup r package  <cit> . although a single locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified for trsv sensitivity, our results suggest that genomic prediction performs better than marker-assisted selection. we showed that the prediction accuracy among the additional  <dig> soybean pis was close to that obtained from the cross-validation study of the  <dig> pis used for the gwas. moreover, we noticed the prediction was more accurate and conservative in identifying soybean accessions that displayed severe necrosis symptoms. there are several limitations of genomic prediction, and one of them is the possibility that the phenotype is a combination of genetic and environmental effects  <cit> . it has been reported that soybean response to trsv may differ by maturity stage  <cit> . accordingly, it is possible that there may be more soybean pis in the usda soybean germplasm collection that have trsv sensitivity of one but may have been misjudged by the genomic prediction.

CONCLUSIONS
trsv is a potential threat to the soybean industry with limited resistance to the virus identified. to understand if additional resistance exists in the usda soybean germplasm collection, we evaluated  <dig> soybean accessions for sensitivity to trsv infection. by performing a gwas using the publicly available soysnp50k marker set, we identified a novel genomic region on chromosome  <dig> containing two candidate lrr-rlk genes that may control sensitivity to trsv. we also assessed the ability of the soysnp50k markers to predict trsv sensitivity for  <dig>  soybean pis in the usda soybean germplasm collection, and high prediction accuracies were obtained. our study not only discovered a new locus for trsv sensitivity but also demonstrated the potential of using gwas and genomic prediction for genetic analysis with the use of the soysnp50k resource.
