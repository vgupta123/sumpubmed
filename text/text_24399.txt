BACKGROUND
krüppel-like factors  comprise a family of zinc-finger transcription factors  that function in metabolism, development and oncogenesis  <cit> . they have a highly conserved dna binding domain comprised of three zinc fingers that binds gc/gt rich regions in the genome. members of this family are distinguished by their highly divergent n-terminal domains which recruit different chromatin modifying factors that in part govern whether the klf functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor  <cit> . krüppel-like factor  <dig>  was identified in a screen of a rat liver cdna library for proteins that bind the basic transcription element , a gc-rich motif in the promoter of the rat cyp1a <dig>  gene  <cit> . the zinc fingers of klf <dig> have high sequence identity with those of specificity protein  <dig> , which binds to similar motifs and typically activates transcription  <cit> . transient transfection assays showed that klf <dig> repressed transcription from a reporter construct containing the bte sequence. however, klf <dig> activated transcription from a reporter containing six tandem repeats of the bte, suggesting that its activity may be governed by the number of binding sites at a locus  <cit> . the n-terminal region of klf <dig> contains two separable transactivation domains required for full activation of the six-repeat bte promoter, and an α-helical motif that interacts with the repressor protein swi-independent 3a   <cit> .

in mouse central nervous system  klf <dig> expression is low at birth, rises postnatally, and peaks at approximately postnatal day   <dig> with highest expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum  <cit> . this postnatal increase in klf <dig> expression depends on thyroid hormone , which acts via its nuclear receptors to directly regulate transcription of the klf <dig> gene . in immature and developing neurons, klf <dig> mediates actions of th on neurite extension  <cit> . however, in mature cortical neurons klf <dig> inhibits neurite outgrowth  <cit> , while in the cerebellum it mediates th-dependent inhibition of axonal regeneration  <cit> . thus, in neuronal cells klf <dig> first promotes, then maintains the differentiated state. it is also required for survival of adult-born dentate granule neurons and purkinje neurons of the cerebellum  <cit> , and it promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and the expression of myelinating genes  <cit> . consistent with these findings, klf9-null mice show neurological defects, including deficits in fear conditioning and late-stage neurogenesis  <cit> . in addition to its developmental role, klf <dig> is also an immediate-early gene that is upregulated in neurons by many extracellular stimuli, including th  <cit> , glucocorticoids  <cit> , and electrical activity  <cit> .

despite evidence for a diversity of developmental and physiological roles for klf <dig>  very little is known about klf <dig> genomic targets in any cell type, and nothing is known about the genes that klf <dig> regulates in neurons. in the present study, we identified direct genomic targets of klf <dig> in the mouse hippocampus-derived neuronal cell line ht <dig>  which is a model for mature hippocampal neurons. this cell line expresses neuronal markers such as enolase and neurofilament proteins, but does not express the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein  <cit> . we engineered several ht <dig> cell lines to allow for control of klf <dig> expression to study klf9-dependent transcriptional responses by rna sequencing ; to identify genomic regions where klf <dig> associates in chromatin by chromatin-streptavidin precipitation followed by deep sequencing ; and to investigate the consequences of klf <dig> deletion for gene transcription and cell proliferation . we validated our findings in ht <dig> cells by analyzing klf <dig> association in chromatin in mouse hippocampus by chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay, and mrna levels for putative klf <dig> target genes in wild type and klf9-null mouse hippocampus.

RESULTS
validation of engineered ht <dig> cell lines for the identification of klf <dig> genomic targets
we stably transfected ht <dig> cells with pcdna4:to-klf <dig> and pcdna6:tr vectors , then isolated and screened seven clonal lines for baseline and doxycycline -inducible klf <dig> mrna. one clonal cell line  was selected for further analysis. the mean baseline klf <dig> mrna level of this cell line  was slightly higher than that of the parent line, but this was not statistically significant . after treatment with dox for 8 h klf <dig> mrna increased by ~10-fold  =  <dig> , p < .001; n = 3/treatment; anova), which is within the physiological range seen following hormone treatment in ht <dig> cells, in neonatal mouse brain following hormone treatment  <cit> , and in mouse brain during development  <cit> .fig.  <dig> identification of klf9-regulated genes in ht <dig> cells by rna-sequencing. a treatment of ht <dig>  cells with doxycycline  for 8 h increased klf <dig> mrna ~ <dig> fold compared to vehicle treated cells, but had no effect in parent ht <dig> cells. the baseline klf <dig> mrna level did not differ between parent and  line. means with the same letter are not significantly different . b dox-induced expression of klf <dig> reduces luciferase activity from the pgl <dig> -3xbte plasmid, but not from pgl <dig> -empty. the asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference by student’s two-sample t-test . c validation by rtqpcr of four genes found to be repressed by klf <dig> by rna-seq. treatment with dox for 8 h reduced mrna levels for the four genes in ht <dig>  but not in parent ht <dig> cells. the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from parent cells treated with vehicle or dox, and from ht <dig>  cells treated with vehicle . d time-course showing induction of klf <dig> mrna following treatment of ht <dig>  cells with dox. e validation of repression  or induction  of klf <dig> target genes after treatment of ht <dig>  cells with dox for different times. the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the zero time point 




we were unable to detect the endogenous  or recombinant  klf <dig> protein by western blotting on nuclear extracts of ht <dig> cells , or with extracts from different cells/tissues of mouse or xenopus using different antiserums . we therefore developed a bioassay that served as a proxy for the level of functional klf <dig> protein in the cell. this assay comprised transient transfection of ht <dig>  cells with a luciferase reporter vector containing three tandem repeats of the bte sequence , which supports klf9-dependent transactivation or transrepression depending on the cell type  <cit> ; a promoter-less luciferase vector  served as control. treatment with dox for 8 h reduced luciferase activity by 20% in cells transfected with pgl <dig> -3xbte, but did not alter luciferase activity in empty pgl <dig>  vector-transfected cells  =  <dig> , p < .05; student’s two-sample t-test). to independently confirm that klf <dig> represses activity from this promoter we co-transfected the parent ht <dig> cell line with pgl <dig> -3×bte and the pcs2-klf <dig> expression vector. this produced a statistically significant reduction  in luciferase activity compared with cells transfected with empty pcs <dig> vector  =  <dig> p < .05; student’s two-sample t-test). taken together, our results show that klf <dig> mrna can be induced within the physiological range by dox treatment of ht <dig>  cells, and that this leads to the production of functional klf <dig> protein.

identification of klf9-regulated genes in ht <dig>  cells by rna sequencing
we conducted rna sequencing  on parent ht <dig> cells and the ht <dig>  cell line treated with vehicle or dox for 8 h . we aligned sequencing reads to the mm <dig> build of the mouse genome using bowtie  <cit> , and differences in transcript abundance were quantified using deseq  <cit> . the parent ht <dig> cell line treated with dox showed no gene expression differences compared to parent cells treated with vehicle , supporting that dox treatment does not have a significant impact on the ht <dig> transcriptome. we next compared the vehicle and dox-treated ht <dig>  cells and found  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated . the changes in mrna level after 8 h of dox treatment ranged from −  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the top  <dig> most strongly induced and repressed genes are listed in table  <dig>  and a list of all differentially regulated genes is given in additional file 2: table s <dig>  we validated repression by klf <dig> of  <dig> genes by rtqpcr on rna isolated from parent and ht <dig>  cells treated with vehicle or dox for 8 h  =  <dig> , p < .005; limk1: f

to further validate our rna-seq data set, and to investigate the kinetics of klf9-dependent gene repression, we conducted rtqpcr on ht <dig>  cells treated with dox for different times. we observed a statistically significant increase in klf <dig> mrna by 2 h, which peaked at 4 h and remained elevated through 24 h of dox treatment  =  <dig> , p < .001; n = 4/time point; anova). we then conducted rtqpcr on  <dig> klf9-repressed and  <dig> klf9-induced genes with log <dig> fold changes ranging from −  <dig>  to −  <dig>  for repressed, or  <dig>  to  <dig>  for induced genes. we validated  <dig> repressed genes  =  <dig> , p < .001; limk1: f

identification of sites across the ht <dig> genome where klf <dig> associates in chromatin
we engineered ht <dig> cells to express the e. coli biotin ligase bira  or bira plus a klf <dig> fusion protein with an n-terminal flag tag and biotin ligase recognition peptide   <cit> . this allowed for high-affinity purification of klf <dig> in chromatin by streptavidin precipitation . we used western blotting to detect the biotinylated fusion protein with streptavidin-hrp in ht <dig> nuclear extract . previous work showed that klf <dig> associates in chromatin with the klf <dig> 5′ upstream region in nih 3 t <dig> cells . we therefore investigated if klf <dig> associated in chromatin with this genomic region in ht <dig> cells as proof-of-principle for the chsp technique. first, we conducted chip assay for klf <dig> on chromatin from the parent ht <dig> cell line. this resulted in ~ <dig> fold enrichment above background  at the klf <dig> promoter but not at a klf <dig> intronic region which lacks sp/klf motifs  = . <dig>  p = .428; promoter region, t  =  <dig> , p < .05; n = 4/treatment; student’s two-sample t-test). next, we conducted chsp on chromatin from ht <dig>  and ht <dig>  cells. this resulted in ~ <dig> fold enrichment above background  at the klf <dig> promoter but not at the same klf <dig> intronic region  = − <dig> , p < .0005; n = 4/cell line; student’s two-sample t-test). these findings support that both native klf <dig> and the flbio-klf <dig> fusion protein associate in chromatin at the klf <dig> locus, and that the chsp technique results in a greater signal/noise ratio than chip assay.fig.  <dig> identification of genome-wide association of klf <dig> in ht <dig> cell chromatin using chromatin-streptavidin precipitation sequencing. a ht <dig>  cells express biotinylated klf <dig>  whole cell extracts from the ht <dig> parent cell line , ht <dig>  cells  or ht <dig>   were fractionated on 10% sds-page and analyzed by western blotting using streptavidin-hrp. b chromatin-streptavidin precipitation gives ~25-fold enrichment at the klf <dig> promoter in ht <dig>  cells compared with ht <dig>  cells. precipitated dna was analyzed by qpcr at the klf <dig> promoter and intron . the asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference by student’s two-sample t-test . c genome browser  views showing the location of klf <dig> peaks at eight klf9-repressed genes. top track = reads from cells expressing bira alone; bottom track = cells expressing bira + flbio-klf <dig>  the 5′ flanking region of each locus is shown; bars below the peaks represent exons, lines represent introns. d validation of chsp-seq peaks  by targeted chsp with quantitative pcr. chromatin isolated from ht <dig>  and ht <dig>  cells is compared. the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences analyzed by student’s two-sample t-test . e klf <dig> associates with the same genomic loci in mouse hippocampus in vivo as in ht <dig> cells. targeted chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays for klf <dig> were conducted on chromatin isolated from adult mouse hippocampus. the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the normal goat serum  igg control analyzed by student’s two-sample t-test 




we conducted chsp sequencing  on chromatin isolated from ht <dig>  and ht <dig>  cells to identify sites of klf <dig> association in chromatin. we used two independent peak calling programs  to identify genomic regions with higher densities of mapped reads  <cit> . macs analysis identified  <dig>  peaks, while pepr analysis identified  <dig>  peaks present in ht <dig>  but not in ht <dig>  cells. all except four of the peaks called by pepr were also called by macs; the peaks called by both programs were more enriched  than those called only by macs . we restricted further analysis to only those peaks called by both programs , and then applied the program peaksplitter to identify and subdivide regions with multiple closely spaced peaks  <cit> . peaksplitter is only compatible with macs; we therefore analyzed the macs dataset with peaksplitter, then used the program bedtools to extract the overlap of these split peaks with the peaks called by pepr  <cit> . examples of how this approach classifies peaks are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  this approach gave a final count of  <dig>  klf <dig> peaks, which ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in length . all peak coordinates, nearest gene and average sequencing read density across the peak  are given in additional file 5: table s <dig>  sequencing and analysis of chsp dna from ht <dig>  cells showed very few regions  with higher mapped sequencing read density compared with ht <dig>  cells. this demonstrates that the bira-flbio platform allowed for identification of klf9-associated genomic regions with very low background.

validation of klf <dig> peaks identified by chsp in ht <dig> cells
to validate the chsp-seq dataset we analyzed  <dig> klf <dig> peaks using targeted chsp- and chip-qpcr assays. the aligned sequencing read densities from the  <dig> genomic regions are shown in fig. 2c, with peaks arranged from largest  to smallest . the small peak at the mapk <dig> 5′ upstream region was detected by macs but not by pepr ; we analyzed this region to investigate the lower limit of detection of the chsp-seq data set. all genomic regions tested showed significantly higher signal with chsp dna from ht <dig>  cells compared with ht <dig>  cells  = − <dig> , p < .001; klf16: t

klf <dig> associates in chromatin from mouse hippocampus with genomic regions identified by chsp-seq in ht <dig> cells
to determine if klf <dig> associates in chromatin in mouse hippocampus at genomic sites identified in ht <dig>  cells, we conducted targeted chip assays using chromatin isolated from the hippocampal region of the brain of adult wild type mice . we analyzed the same  <dig> genomic regions described above for ht <dig> cells and found statistically significant klf <dig> chip signal at  <dig> of the  <dig> regions in both males and females  =  <dig> , p < .05; klf16: t
 = . <dig> , p < .001; klf13: t

 =  <dig> , p < .05; mapk11: t
 = −. <dig>  p = .979; n = 10; student’s two-sample t-test). since there were no statistically significant differences between the sexes we pooled the data for analysis. the lack of klf <dig> chip signal at the 5′ upstream region of mapk <dig> is consistent with this region having the lowest chsp signal in ht <dig>  cells . we did not detect klf <dig> chip signal in chromatin from mouse hippocampus at intronic regions located 10 kb or more downstream from the identified klf <dig> peaks in the klf <dig>  klf <dig>  limk <dig> or nr3c <dig> genes . taken together, our findings support that the bira/flbio platform applied to the ht <dig> cell line is a useful model for identifying klf <dig> genomic targets in mouse hippocampus.

klf <dig> associates in chromatin primarily with proximal promoter regions
we used the chip-enrich web tool  <cit>  to assign klf <dig> peaks to genes based on the nearest transcription start site , and to identify where the peaks were distributed with respect to the tsss of annotated genes. based on this analysis,  <dig> % of the peaks fell within 10 kb of a tss, and of these, 86%  were 1 kb or less from a tss . the chip-enrich software assigns peaks to genes based on the closest tss, which results in some genes having multiple peaks associated with them. after accounting for such double-counted targets, this left  <dig>  genes with at least one associated klf <dig> peak . the majority of these genes  had at least one klf <dig> peak within 10 kb of their tss.fig.  <dig> klf <dig> associates near transcription sites and is more likely to be associated with repressed than induced genes. a distribution of klf <dig> peaks with respect to transcription start sites . b distribution of klf <dig> peaks with respect to gene features. c overlap of klf9-regulated genes with genes containing klf <dig> peaks within 10 kb of their tss. d the median expression ratio of all genes expressed in ht <dig> cells, with or without associated klf <dig> peaks, in parent ht <dig> and ht <dig>  cells treated with vehicle or doxycycline  for 8 h. in the parent cell line there was no expression difference after dox treatment whether or not the genes have klf <dig> peaks associated . in the ht <dig>  cell line treatment with dox caused a statistically significant decrease in median expression ratio, but only for genes with associated klf <dig> peaks 




we next used the homer peak annotation program to analyze the distribution of klf <dig> peaks relative to the tss. of the peaks centered within 1 kb of a tss,  <dig> % were centered upstream,  <dig> % were centered within the 5′ untranslated region, and  <dig> % were centered either in the first exon or the first intron . we then used the cis-regulatory element annotation system  to map how sequencing reads were distributed with respect to genomic features  <cit> . analysis of the distribution of mapped sequencing reads around tsss revealed a moderate bias towards regions immediately upstream of the tsss . thus, the larger peaks tend to be centered in 5′ flanking regions rather than in 5′ utrs, exons or introns.

of the  <dig> genes that we found to be repressed by klf <dig> by rna-seq,  <dig>  have a klf <dig> peak within 10 kb of their tss. by contrast, of the  <dig> genes found to be induced by klf <dig> only  <dig>  had a peak within 10 kb of its tss . this is consistent with klf <dig> acting primarily as a transcriptional repressor. differentially regulated genes without associated klf <dig> peaks may be indirect target genes . if this is correct, it suggests that klf9-induced genes are mostly indirect targets, while the majority of repressed genes are directly regulated by klf <dig> 

an additional  <dig>  genes had at least one klf <dig> peak located within 10 kb of their tss, but their mrna levels analyzed by rna-seq were not significantly affected by forced klf <dig> expression. however, when we looked at the mean mrna level for all polyadenylated transcripts detected by rna-seq in the ht <dig>  cell line treated with vehicle or dox, and compared genes that did or did not have klf <dig> peaks within 10 kb of their tss, we found evidence for a general repressive action of klf <dig> on transcription of genes possessing klf <dig> peaks . we calculated the ratio of the mean mrna levels with dox to that with vehicle for all expressed genes in each of the two cell lines . an expression ratio of  <dig> indicates no change caused by dox treatment, > <dig> indicates an increased mrna level, and < <dig> a decreased mrna level. in comparing the expression ratio of genes with or without klf <dig> peaks, we found no statistically significant difference in the parent cell line, but a statistically significant lower median expression ratio for genes containing klf <dig> peaks in the ht <dig>  cell line . this supports that klf <dig> exerts a general repressive action on transcription of genes with which it associates.

identification of consensus sp/klf motifs at regions of klf <dig> chsp-seq peaks
we used the program homer to identify enriched dna sequence motifs in klf <dig> chsp-seq peaks  <cit> . the most highly enriched sequence was a sp/klf motif  that was present in  <dig> % of all peaks; hereafter we refer to this sequence as the ‘klf <dig> consensus motif’ . we identified  <dig> additional motifs enriched at klf <dig> peaks that are partially redundant with the klf <dig> consensus motif. the top four most frequently observed sp/klf motifs  are shown in fig. 4a, and the remainder are listed in additional file 9: table s <dig>  the klf <dig> consensus motif, and the  <dig> additional motifs are hereafter collectively referred to as sp/klf motifs. at least one sp/klf motif was present in 98% of all klf <dig> peaks, supporting that the presence of sp/klf motifs is important for targeting klf <dig> in the genome. in addition, homer identified  <dig> significantly enriched motifs in klf <dig> peaks other than the sp/klf motifs, the most significantly enriched of which  matched previously reported binding sites for early growth response  <dig> , elk <dig>  ets transcription factor , e2f transcription factor  <dig> , fos-like  <dig> , basic helix-loop-helix , and regulatory factor x domain-containing  <dig> . a complete list of enriched motifs is given in additional file 10: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> sp/klf motifs are enriched at klf <dig> peaks, they correlate with peak features, and they are required for transcriptional repression by klf <dig>  a position weight matrices showing the klf <dig> consensus motif  and the four most commonly occurring sp/klf motifs that were partially redundant with the consensus motif . b histogram showing the probability of the klf <dig> consensus motif occurrence  and average enrichment  across all klf <dig> peaks. c number of non-redundant sp/klf motifs correlates with the mean tag density across a peak 




the klf <dig> consensus motif tended to occur at or near the center of peaks, and the average density of mapped sequencing reads across the peaks closely matched the frequency of motif occurrence . the peaks contained between  <dig> and  <dig> sp/klf motifs , with an average of  <dig> /peak. there was a weak but statistically significant correlation between the number of non-redundant sp/klf motifs and average peak height .

we also used homer to analyze the promoters of the  <dig> genes that were induced by klf <dig>  sequences of 1000 bp in length located upstream of the tsss of these genes were downloaded from the ucsc genome browser. scanning these sequences for the presence of sp/klf motifs found by de novo analysis of the klf <dig> chsp peaks found that only  <dig> of  <dig>  contained one copy of the klf <dig> consensus motif, while  <dig> of  <dig>  had at least one sp/klf motif.

peak shape clustering reveals three separate categories of klf <dig> peaks
we analyzed klf <dig> peaks using the program sic-chip  <cit> , which clusters peaks into subcategories based on five shape parameters   <cit> . boxplots of the distribution of each parameter in each cluster, and a scatterplot of how shape parameters correlate with each other and group peaks by cluster are shown in additional file 11: figure s <dig>  by these criteria we divided the peaks into three categories, examples of which are shown in fig. 5a. peaks in cluster  <dig>  are of low average height and low complexity; peaks in cluster  <dig>  are of low height but greater complexity ; peaks in cluster  <dig>  are large and of low complexity.fig.  <dig> klf <dig> peaks group into shape clusters that show different likelihood of association with repressed genes, and degree of transcriptional repression. a klf <dig> peaks in ht <dig> cells can be grouped into three clusters based on shape and height characteristics. example peaks from each cluster are shown. the graph height  and viewing window size  are held constant. b distribution of the klf <dig> consensus motif  and mapped sequencing read density  within peaks from each shape cluster. sequencing read density closely tracks the probability of the occurrence of consensus motifs in all clusters. c average number of sp/klf motifs and number of klf <dig> consensus motifs present in peaks belonging to each cluster. boxplots indicate 75% and 25% quantiles; dots indicate 5% and 95% quantiles. means with the same letter are not significantly different . top: peaks of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contain more sp/klf-like motifs than those of cluster 1; bottom: peaks of cluster  <dig> have more copies of the klf <dig> consensus motif than peaks of clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  d percentage of peaks of each cluster associated with repressed genes. e median ratio of mrna levels in ht <dig>  cells treated +/− dox of genes associated with peaks from each cluster. means with the same letter are not significantly different 




the klf <dig> consensus motif was highly enriched in peaks from all three categories. in genomic regions defined by clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  the motifs were located near the center of the peak, while in cluster  <dig> the distribution was spread evenly across the peak . the density of mapped reads  closely matched the distribution of klf <dig> consensus motifs in all three clusters . sequencing read density  therefore correlates with the presence of klf <dig> consensus motifs, even in wide peaks with multiple local maxima such as those seen in cluster  <dig>  clusters  <dig> and  <dig> had a larger number of sp/klf motifs per peak than cluster  <dig>  =  <dig> , p < .001; kruskal-wallis non-parametric anova). there was no significant difference between clusters  <dig> and  <dig> in average number of sp/klf motifs, but peaks from cluster  <dig> contained more copies of the klf <dig> consensus motif  =  <dig> , p < .001; kruskal-wallis non-parametric anova).

the proportion of peaks associated with klf9-repressed genes differed among clusters, with cluster  <dig> having the highest percentage, and cluster  <dig> the lowest . this supports that large peaks with larger numbers of sp/klf and klf <dig> consensus motifs are more likely to be associated with genes that are repressed by klf <dig>  in further support of this observation, the distribution of peaks from each cluster associated with repressed genes was nonrandom. peaks from cluster  <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of all peaks, and 35% of repressed genes had at least one peak from cluster  <dig> associated. in contrast, while peaks from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of all peaks, respectively,  <dig>  and 23% of all repressed genes had a peak from clusters  <dig> or  <dig> associated . peaks from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are therefore more likely to be associated with repression by klf <dig> than would be expected by chance .

we also calculated the expression ratio of genes with peaks from each cluster in vehicle vs. dox-treated ht <dig>  cells. genes with peaks from cluster  <dig> show a lower expression ratio  than genes with peaks from cluster  <dig>  and genes with peaks from cluster  <dig> have a lower expression ratio than from cluster  <dig>  supporting that klf <dig> exerts a stronger repressive effect on transcription from peaks with either a greater number of consensus motifs or a higher chsp signal  =  <dig> , p < .001; kruskal-wallis non-parametric anova).

genomic regions where klf <dig> associates support transcriptional repression by klf <dig>  and this requires intact sp/klf motifs
to determine if klf <dig> can repress transcription of genes with which it associates in chromatin we transfected ht <dig>  cells with pgl <dig>  reporter constructs containing dna fragments corresponding to genomic regions with klf <dig> chsp peaks: klf <dig> , klf <dig> , limk <dig>  and mapk <dig>  . treatment with dox for 24 h reduced luciferase activity from pgl <dig> -klf <dig> by 33%, pgl <dig> -klf <dig> by 45%, and pgl <dig> -limk <dig> by  <dig> %; luciferase activity from the pgl <dig> -mapk <dig> vector was unaffected by dox treatment  =  <dig> , p < 10−5; klf16: t  =  <dig> , p < .005; limk1: t  =  <dig> , p < .01; mapk11: t  =  <dig> , p = .166; klf <dig> mutant: t  = − <dig> , p = .213; n = 6/treatment; student’s two-sample t-test).fig.  <dig> klf <dig> represses transcription from synthetic promoters of klf <dig> target genes, and sp/klf-like motifs are required for transcriptional repression by klf <dig>  we transfected ht <dig>  cells with reporter constructs containing cloned dna fragments corresponding to genomic regions with klf <dig> peaks associated with the indicated genes . forced expression of klf <dig> repressed transcriptional activity from the klf <dig>  klf <dig> and limk <dig>  but not from the mapk <dig> promoter. mutation of six sp/klf-like motifs in the klf <dig> promoter abrogated klf9-dependent repression. the asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference from control by student’s two-sample t-test 




to determine if sp/klf motifs are required for repression by klf <dig> we focused on the klf <dig> 5′ flanking region, which contains  <dig> sp/klf motifs . we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert these motifs to a series of  <dig> thymidines; the complete sequence of the klf <dig> dna fragment and the location of the mutated nucleotides are given in additional file 13: table s <dig>  mutation of two of the  <dig> sp/klf motifs , either individually or in combination, did not affect repression by klf <dig> . however, mutation of all six sites abolished klf9-dependent transcriptional repression .

forced expression of klf <dig> promotes recruitment of sin3a to some genomic regions with klf <dig> peaks
our rna-seq experiment showed that klf <dig> acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor in ht <dig> cells. the n-terminus of klf <dig> has a motif for interaction with the scaffolding repressor protein sin3a  <cit>  which recruits histone deacetylases to generate a compact chromatin structure and transcriptional repression. we therefore investigated whether sin3a was recruited to klf <dig> peaks by conducting chip assay for sin3a on chromatin isolated from ht <dig>  cells treated with vehicle or dox for 12 h. treatment with dox increased the mean klf <dig> chip signal at eight genomic regions corresponding to klf <dig> chsp peaks; this increase was statistically significant for six of the eight peaks . there were statistically significant increases in sin3a chip signal following dox treatment at the klf <dig>  sin3a, nr3c <dig> and limk <dig> genes, but it was unchanged at slc11a <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig>  and was reduced at mapk <dig>  = − <dig> , p < .005; klf16: t

depletion of klf <dig> leads to dysregulation of klf <dig> target genes
to determine if loss of klf <dig> alters the expression of klf <dig> target genes we used crispr/cas <dig> genome editing to generate klf <dig> knockdown  and knockout  ht <dig> cell lines. a description of the mutations introduced into these cell lines is given in additional file 15: table s <dig>  the crispr line  <dig> exhibited significantly higher mrna levels compared to wild type for all klf9-repressed genes analyzed except mapk <dig>  =  <dig> , p < .005; klf13: f

we also analyzed mrna levels for a subset of klf <dig> target genes identified in ht <dig> cells in the hippocampus of klf9-null mice. klf <dig> mrna in the mouse cns is low at birth, then rises during the first 4 weeks of life, paralleling the postnatal rise in plasma th concentration  <cit> . the mrnas for klf <dig>  limk <dig>  apc <dig> and nlgn <dig> were dysregulated at pnd <dig> in klf9-null mice, although the direction of change differed among the genes  = − <dig> , p < .01; limk <dig>  t

gene ontology analysis supports roles for klf <dig> in neuronal morphology and function
we conducted gene ontology  and pathway analysis using genecodis on klf9-repressed genes  . four go: panther pathways were enriched among klf9-repressed genes: “cytoskeletal regulation by rho gtpase”, “inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway”, “wnt signaling pathway”, and “b cell activation” . we excluded the klf9-induced genes from the pathway analysis because of the small number discovered and because we were able to validate only  <dig> of  <dig> tested.table  <dig> genes repressed by forced klf <dig> expression in ht <dig>  cells and genes with klf <dig> peaks associated in ht <dig>  cells were subjected to pathway analysis using genecodis

the top ten most enriched pathways among genes with klf <dig> peaks associateda
pathways are ordered from most- to least-enriched based on the false discovery rate -adjusted p value


a a complete list of enriched pathways is given in additional file 16: table s7




we then conducted pathway analysis on the set of all genes with klf <dig> chsp peaks. the most enriched panther pathways among this set of genes were “apoptosis”, “integrin signaling pathway”, “inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway” and “cytoskeletal regulation by rho-gtpase” . the overlap with the categories enriched among klf9-repressed genes supports an important role for klf <dig> in these pathways. we also conducted separate analyses on the genes with peaks of different shape clusters associated . the top panther pathways enriched in genes associated with cluster  <dig> peaks were “apoptosis”, “wnt signaling pathway” and “egf receptor signaling pathway”. in contrast, the top pathways enriched in the set of genes associated with cluster  <dig> peaks were “cytoskeletal regulation by rho gtpase” and “metabotropic glutamate receptor group ii pathway”, while cluster  <dig> peaks were associated with genes in the pathways “pdgf signaling”, “fas signaling pathway” and “cytoskeletal regulation by rho gtpase” .

depletion of klf <dig> shortens cell cycle in ht <dig> cells and de-represses genes involved in cell proliferation
previous work showed that klf <dig> can reduce proliferation of different cell types . one of the top go: panther pathways enriched among klf9-repressed genes was ‘wnt signaling’. the wnt pathway has been shown to increase cell proliferation in diverse tissue types, including in neurons  <cit> . we therefore looked at whether the cell cycle was altered in klf9-deficient ht <dig> cells using flow cytometry. to facilitate our ability to observe differences in the cell cycle we cultured cells in reduced serum . we found that both crispr cell lines had a significantly higher proportion of cells in m phase  compared with the parent ht <dig> cell line : f
 =  <dig> , p < .001; m : f
 =  <dig> , p < .001; n = 4/cell line; anova). the mrna levels for two confirmed klf <dig> targets that are classified as wnt-pathway related and are implicated in promoting mitosis, b cell cll/lymphoma  <dig>  and inositol triphosphate receptor  <dig> , were significantly elevated in both crispr lines  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; iprt3: f
 =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; n = 6/cell line; anova).

discussion
here we report the first genome-wide analysis of klf <dig> genomic targets in a mammalian neuronal cell type. klf <dig> has been implicated in several aspects of neural development and regeneration, and is regulated by hormones  <cit> , nfκb  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , and electrical activity  <cit> . we therefore set out to identify its genomic targets in neurons to understand how it mediates transcriptional responses to these stimuli, and regulates neuronal differentiation, survival and plasticity. we identified klf9-regulated genes and genomic regions where klf <dig> associates in chromatin using the mouse hippocampus-derived neuronal cell line ht <dig>  we show that klf <dig> functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, that it associates in chromatin predominantly near tsss, and that it regulates transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, wnt signaling and inflammation, among other pathways. furthermore, by analyzing a subset of the genes and genomic regions identified in ht <dig> cells, we verified that these genes are bona fide klf <dig> targets in mouse hippocampus in vivo, supporting that the ht <dig> cell line represents a useful model for mature hippocampal neurons, at least for the purpose of identifying candidate klf <dig> target genes. taken together, our findings represent an important advance in understanding the diverse developmental and physiological roles that klf <dig> has in the mammalian central nervous system.

klf <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor through association with proximal promoter regions
findings from our rna-seq experiment conducted in ht <dig> cells support that klf <dig> acts predominately as a transcriptional repressor, with  <dig> times more genes repressed than induced. this is consistent with a recent study in glioblastoma cells that showed that klf <dig> functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . of the  <dig> klf9-repressed genes that we attempted to validate by rtqpcr, we were able to confirm  <dig>  however, of the  <dig> klf9-induced genes tested by rtqpcr, we could validate only  <dig> . induction of these genes by klf <dig> was transient, with all  <dig> genes returning to baseline by 24 h following dox treatment. by contrast, mrna levels of  <dig> of the  <dig> validated repressed genes remained low at 24 h.

using chsp-seq we found that klf <dig> associates predominantly with genomic regions within 1 kb of tsss. genes found to be repressed by klf <dig> by rna-seq were much more likely than induced genes to have klf <dig> associated in chromatin . these findings support that klf <dig> represses gene transcription by associating in chromatin at or near proximal promoters. in support of this, the presence of klf <dig> at proximal promoter regions was associated with weak repression when averaged across all genes with peaks associated . because only one of the genes induced by klf <dig> had a peak associated and the induced genes showed only transient induction, or failed to validate by rtqpcr, we conclude that they are either false positives or indirect targets of klf <dig>  importantly, we found that of  <dig> peaks investigated,  <dig> had klf <dig> associated with them in chromatin isolated from adult mouse hippocampus. this supports that ht <dig> cells can be used as a model to identify potential klf <dig> genomic targets in adult mouse hippocampus, and to investigate klf <dig> function in chromatin in mature neurons.

klf <dig> association in chromatin is strongly correlated with the presence of sp/klf motifs
the most enriched motif in klf <dig> peaks was an sp/klf motif  that was present in 75% of all peaks; furthermore, 98% of all peaks had at least one sp/klf motif that was similar to the consensus motif. the consensus motif tended to occur near the center of peaks and its position correlated with the density of mapped reads, supporting that klf <dig> binds directly to these dna sequences.

early studies on klf <dig> function showed that it could act as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the number of sp/klf motifs present in the regulatory element  <cit> . in cv- <dig> cells, klf <dig> activated transcription from promoters containing multiple sp/klf motifs, but repressed transcription from promoters containing a single sp/klf motif. most klf <dig> peaks in ht <dig> cells  had more than one sp/klf motif, but klf <dig> acted almost exclusively as a repressor, suggesting that its regulatory activity is not necessarily related to the number of sp/klf motifs present. other studies have shown that klf <dig> can activate or repress the same promoter in the same cell type depending on the developmental stage  <cit> . the chromatin environment and the complement of interacting proteins may be more important than the promoter sequence for determining whether klf <dig> acts as an activator or repressor.

an additional sp/klf-like motif different from the klf <dig> consensus motif was present in  <dig> % of peaks . this motif most closely matches the binding site for sp <dig>  which typically acts as a transcriptional activator  <cit> . thus, the relative concentrations of klf <dig>  which likely acts as a repressor, and sp <dig> in the cell may determine the transcriptional activity from these loci  <cit> . however, it is also possible that these are binding sites for other sp/klf proteins , which may act as repressors or activators of transcription.

seventeen other enriched motifs similar to known tf response elements were identified by homer in klf <dig> peaks . several of these motifs are response elements for tfs important for neuronal structure and function. for example, two of the motifs in this list match binding sites for members of the immediate early gene families egr and fos , which are involved in neural activity-dependent transcription  <cit> . klf <dig> is also induced by neural activity  <cit> , and thus may modulate the activity of these tfs, or vice versa, when recruited to common genomic regions..

another enriched motif  was the e-box. the e-box is required for transcriptional activation by the core circadian transcription factors clock and bmal <dig>  which form a regulatory feedback loop with per and cry proteins to orchestrate circadian rhythms in most tissues . several klf genes have been found to exhibit circadian oscillations in their expression, including klf <dig>  <cit> . klf <dig> mediates circadian variation in cell proliferation in keratinocytes  <cit> , but to our knowledge its role in circadian physiology in other tissues has not been investigated. one of the go: panther pathways enriched among genes with klf <dig> peaks is “circadian clock system” . this suggests that klf <dig> may co-regulate clock/bmal <dig> target genes, and thus modulate the core loop of the cellular circadian clock. while other klfs have been shown to function as clock-output genes to orchestrate circadian physiology  <cit> , no klfs have been shown to directly participate in the clock/per regulatory loop.

clustering analysis provides a basis for differentiating peaks associated with repressed genes
different types of chromatin-associated proteins have different chip-seq profiles  and different genomic regions associated with the same factor may have different peak shapes  <cit> . we found that klf <dig> peaks could be divided into three groups. large, sharp peaks  or broad, complex peaks  were more likely to be associated with genes repressed by klf <dig> than were smaller, less complex peaks . in addition, the genes associated with cluster  <dig> peaks were on average more strongly repressed after dox treatment on ht <dig>  cells .

the different peak characteristics could reflect at least three basic mechanisms: different numbers of klf <dig> molecules recruited, perhaps related to the number of sp/klf motifs; differences in the chromatin environment  that modulates accessibility of the locus; or local differences in the presence of protein interacting partners that may stabilize klf <dig> association at the region. peaks from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> had more sp/klf motifs than peaks from cluster  <dig> , which is consistent with recruitment of more klf <dig> molecules as measured by height and area under the curve . cluster  <dig> peaks had the same average number of sp/klf motifs as cluster  <dig> peaks, but they had more copies of the klf <dig> consensus motif ; the high, sharp signal at these loci could reflect a higher affinity for klf <dig> binding to the klf <dig> consensus motif leading to more klf <dig> association. alternatively, or in addition, the chromatin environment at these regions may be more accessible, and/or there is greater recruitment of klf <dig> interacting proteins that leads to increased crosslinking efficiency. whether the peak characteristics result in differences in the kinetics and/or magnitude of transcriptional regulation of the associated genes requires investigation.

repression by klf <dig> requires intact sp/klf motifs
to determine if the genomic regions where klf <dig> associates are capable of supporting transcriptional repression, we isolated and subcloned several dna fragments corresponding to peaks identified by chsp-seq that were located in the 5’ upstream regions of klf9-responsive genes. forced expression of klf <dig> repressed transcriptional activity supported by the klf <dig>  limk <dig> and klf <dig> upstream regions, but not by mapk <dig>  for the klf <dig> promoter we showed that sp/klf motifs are required for klf9-dependent transrepression. although the mapk <dig> region has five predicted sp/klf-like motifs, it lacks any copies of the klf <dig> consensus motif. by contrast, the klf <dig>  limk <dig> and klf <dig> upstream regions that we investigated have  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> klf <dig> consensus motifs, respectively. based on these findings we hypothesize that the klf <dig> consensus motif is essential for mediating klf9-dependent repression. the presence of multiple sp/klf motifs at most klf <dig> peaks implies that such redundancy may be a feature of many, if not most, klf <dig> genomic targets. these sites could also potentially act as binding sites for other sp or klf-like proteins, which suggests the potential for combinatorial regulation by a network of klfs  <cit> .

cellular pathways targeted by klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells
to evaluate cellular pathways regulated by klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells we analyzed go: panther enriched pathways among klf9-repressed genes identified by rna-seq, and also enriched pathways among genes with klf <dig> peaks identified by chsp-seq. the most enriched go: panther pathway among klf9-repressed genes was “cytoskeletal regulation by rho-gtpase”. this pathway was number  <dig> on the list of enriched pathways among klf <dig> bound genes . among the klf9-regulated genes in this category are limk <dig>  which has been shown to promote neurite extension through inhibition of actin depolymerization  <cit> , and mapk <dig> , which positively regulates neurite extension and arborization in hippocampal neurons  <cit> . several genes involved in actin polymerization, such as limk <dig>  were direct genomic targets of klf <dig>  the repression of positive regulators of actin polymerization such as limk <dig> is consistent with published findings showing that klf <dig> represses dendritic and axonal remodeling and outgrowth in mature neurons  <cit> . however, this does not explain how klf <dig> promotes neurite elaboration and outgrowth in immature neurons  <cit> . it may regulate a different set of genes, perhaps repressing repressors of growth, or it may upregulate rather than repress the same loci identified in this study at earlier developmental stages  <cit> .

the second most enriched pathway for klf9-repressed genes was “inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway”, and this pathway was number  <dig> on the list of klf <dig> bound genes. several other klfs have been implicated in immune and inflammatory responses  <cit> . for example, klf <dig> promotes differentiation of monocytes and directly upregulates transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- <dig> . it also cooperates with the glucocorticoid receptor to induce expression of anti-inflammatory genes in keratinocytes  <cit> . klf <dig> regulates expression of il- <dig> in cd <dig>  t cells  <cit> . klf <dig> has been found to regulate tgf-beta signaling in cd <dig>  t lymphocytes through modulating expression of tgf-beta receptor type ii expression  <cit> . in contrast, klf <dig> generally has anti-inflammatory actions  <cit> ; for example, it inhibits inflammatory activation of monocytes through inhibition of the transcriptional activity of nf-κb  <cit>  and blocks cd <dig>  t follicular helper cell differentiation  <cit> . however, klf <dig> has also been shown to be required for activation of vascular endothelial cells in response to proinflammatory factors  <cit> . klf <dig> has been shown to function as an accessory transcription factor for nf-kappa b  <cit> . to our knowledge, there have been no reports linking klf <dig> to inflammatory signaling. however, klf <dig> is induced by glucocorticoids in mouse macrophages  <cit>  and in neurons  <cit>  via conserved glucocorticoid response elements  <cit> . the repressive activity of klf <dig> may serve as a counterbalance to pro-inflammatory klfs such as klf <dig>  allowing for modulation of the immune response. it is also noteworthy that the klf <dig> synergy module, which is an ultraconserved enhancer element located 4–6 kb upstream of the tsss of tetrapod klf <dig> genes, contains a nfkb site to which p <dig> associates, and lps can modulate klf <dig> expression in ht <dig> cells  <cit> .

the top enriched cellular pathway for genes with klf <dig> chsp peaks was apoptotic signaling. interestingly, these genes are most strongly associated with peaks from cluster 1; whereas, peaks from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are enriched in cytoskeletal and growth factor-related pathways, respectively . genes with peaks from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were more likely to be repressed by 8 h of dox treatment than genes from cluster  <dig>  if the kinetics and/or magnitude of transcriptional regulation varies among genes from the different peak clusters, with genes from cluster  <dig> exhibiting slower kinetics than genes from clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  then one can propose the following model: rapid induction of klf <dig>  suppresses morphological remodeling and cell proliferation by direct repression of a set of ‘first tier’ target genes . on the other hand, prolonged induction of klf <dig> in response to chronic stress may promote repression of anti-apoptotic genes and induction of pro-apoptotic genes , leading to cell death. this model might be supported by findings of a role for klf <dig> in promoting cell death in response to chemotherapeutics and oxidative stress  <cit> .

depletion of klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells leads to de-repression of klf <dig> target genes
knock-down or knock-out of klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells using crispr/cas <dig> genome editing caused dysregulation of several klf <dig> target genes. the genes klf <dig>  klf <dig> and limk <dig> were repressed by forced klf <dig> expression, but were increased in klf <dig> deficient ht <dig> cells, supporting a direct role for klf <dig> in regulating transcription of these genes. the genes slc11a <dig> and klf <dig> were not repressed by forced klf <dig> expression, but their mrnas were increased following klf <dig> depletion, and both genes had klf <dig> peaks. mapk <dig> did not show any change in expression in crispr knockout cells despite its weak repression by forced klf <dig> expression and the presence of a klf <dig> peak at its proximal promoter region. the klf <dig> peak at mapk <dig> was at the lower limit of detection by chsp-seq . ‘weak’ peaks such as this may represent genes that are regulated under conditions of high klf <dig> expression, but are not dependent on klf <dig> for controlling baseline expression.

despite the changes seen in ht <dig> cells, few differences in target gene mrna level were seen in klf <dig> ko mice compared to age-matched wild-type animals, and what differences did exist tended to disappear after the first postnatal week . this suggests that there are compensatory mechanisms for regulating baseline mrna levels in the absence of klf <dig>  the klf family members  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are all expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus, based on in situ hybridization data provided in the allen brain atlas  <cit> . some or all of these may contribute to compensatory regulation in the absence of klf <dig>  functional compensation between klfs has been demonstrated in embryonic stem cells, in which klfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> form a partially redundant network that maintains pluripotency. knockout of all three is required to induce differentiation into fibroblasts  <cit> . klf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are the klf family members most similar to klf <dig> and are therefore the most likely candidates for compensating for loss of klf <dig> in the hippocampus  <cit> . in the mouse uterus klf <dig> and klf <dig> have partially overlapping functions such that klf <dig> can partially compensate for the absence of klf <dig>  <cit> . we found that klf <dig> associates with and represses transcription from the promoters of klf <dig> and klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells and associates with these genes in the mouse hippocampus in vivo. to our knowledge this is the first evidence of repression of direct cross-regulation between klf <dig> and klf <dig> and supports that these klf proteins may regulate each other’s expression as well as activating or repressing shared targets. investigation of the klf <dig> and klf <dig> cistromes in ht <dig> cells and the mouse hippocampus will be important to shed further light on the extent of cooperation or antagonism among klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> in neurons.

a role for klf <dig> in modulation of the cell cycle in ht <dig> cells
previous studies showed that klf <dig> can suppress cell proliferation and/or promote apotosis  <cit> . consistent with these findings, we found that knockdown or knockout of klf <dig> shortened the cell cycle in ht <dig> cells and increased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation. the klf9-repressed genes bcl- <dig> and itpr <dig> are part of the wnt signaling pathway. bcl- <dig> was shown to suppress apoptosis through induction of cyclin d <dig>  and is sufficient to immortalize mouse embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> . in a human breast cancer cell line  knockdown of itpr <dig> caused cell cycle arrest, supporting that it is important for promoting tumor proliferation  <cit> . furthermore, itpr <dig> can confer resistance to apoptosis  <cit> . the increase in expression of these two genes, and possibly other genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, may underlie the increase in cell proliferation that we observed after depletion of klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells. this would be consistent with reports that klf <dig> can act as a tumor suppressor and promote apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutics  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we provide the first unbiased analysis of klf <dig> genomic targets in mouse hippocampal neurons. we also provide strong evidence for a cross-regulatory network of klfs that may be important for regulating the transcriptome. our findings establish a foundation for understanding the molecular basis for klf9’s effects on neuronal morphology and cell proliferation. finally, we demonstrate the utility of ht <dig> cells for identifying genomic targets of tfs in the mouse hippocampus.
