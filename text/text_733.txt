BACKGROUND
in polytocous species as mouse and pig the number of ova shed is an important parameter for reproductive performance. folliculogenesis, ovulation, and luteinization are regulated through endocrine and paracrine feedback mechanisms along the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. important endocrine factors are the hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone  and luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland, and steroid and peptide hormones generated within the ovary as estrogen, progesterone, inhibin, activin, and follistatin. within the ovary also paracrine, locally acting hormones and growth factors of the igf and tgf-β families play an important role during folliculogenesis and ovulation  <cit> . in time production, storage, release, but also cease of production and release of these regulatory factors require a well orchestrated activation and de-activation of genes that are involved in this regulatory network. in general, reproductive traits show a relatively low heritability and are strongly affected by environmental factors. nonetheless it could be demonstrated in pig and mouse that selection on litter size can effectively improve the reproductive performance and particularly affects the ovulation number but also other reproductive traits  <cit> . because genetic factors are clearly involved in reproductive performance one must hypothesize that the expression levels of many genes that are involved in the regulatory network of reproduction are different in animals with different fertility performance. therefore differential expression profiling of reproductive organs, mainly the ovary, is an appropriate approach to elucidate the genetic and physiological background of enhanced female reproductive performance. in our recent study it could be clearly demonstrated that a largely increased ovulation number is mainly responsible for high prolificacy in selected high fertility mouse lines  <cit> . mining differentially expressed ovarian genes will help to elucidate the genetic and physiological consequences of selection for reproductive performance but might also help to better understand regulatory pathways that are important for folliculogenesis and successful ovulation.

during the present study a high fertility mouse line, fl <dig>  which was generated by index trait selection over more than  <dig> generations  <cit>  was comparatively analyzed with the non-selected control line, duksi. to screen for differentially expressed ovarian genes, staged ovaries of both lines were screened for differentially abundant transcripts. both lines have been derived from the same genetic pool. this should minimize the number of genetic differences that are only due to non-trait related line-specific differences. the ovarian expression profile of both lines was analyzed by microarray analysis. to include a large number of individuals on one hand and to avoid excessive microarray costs on the other hand,  <dig> animals of each line were combined to six pools. transcript abundance of selected genes were re-evaluated with quantitive real-time pcr  in pooled as well as individual samples to estimate inter-individual variation.

RESULTS
fertility traits
after  <dig> generations of selection, fertility performance was largely and significantly increased in fl <dig>  the mean number of corpora lutea at the first day of pregnancy was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in the control line . the actual number of ova flushed from the oviducts however was even higher,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in fl <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the control , thus exceeding the corresponding number of cl, particularly in fl <dig>  this suggests that individual follicles can release more than one oocyte  <cit> . in fact, the existence of multioocyte follicles has been found in mice  <cit>  but also in other species as goat  <cit> . the mean litter size and litter weight at birth increased during the selection period to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, respectively in fl <dig> compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g in the control line . the body weight of individual newborn pups however was not significantly reduced in fl <dig> despite of the strongly increased number of pups per litter.

microarray analysis
for differential expression profiling, rna preparations of  <dig> animals of each line were combined to  <dig> sample pools with  <dig> individuals per pool. after labeling, the crna of pooled samples was hybridized to moe 430a microarrays, scanned and statistically evaluated. the following thresholds were used to define differentially expressed probe sets:

 <dig>  transcript abundance was considered to be different in fl <dig> when it was at least  <dig>  fold higher or lower compared to that in duksi; -fold change  ≥  <dig>  or ≤ - <dig> 

 <dig>  false discovery rate: q -values <  <dig> 

 <dig>  > 60% of the pairwise comparisons  should lead to one of both statements: increased or decreased

all together,  <dig> of the probe sets passed the first threshold .  <dig> of these showed q-values <  <dig> . the third threshold finally reduced the number of differentially expressed probe sets to  <dig>  these represented only  <dig> distinct transcripts because some transcripts were represented by more than one probe set on the moe 430a microarray. of the differentially expressed transcripts 50% were up-  and 50% were down-regulated  in fl <dig> compared to the control. the fc values varied between - <dig>  to - <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>   <dig>  of the identified transcripts could be assigned to known genes, but only  <dig>  of them mapped significantly  to  <dig> distinct go terms representing biological processes. for the sake of clarity, related go terms were combined to eleven superordinate categories . all  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, their respective gene symbols and gene titles, fc values and respective superordinate categories of biological processes are listed . most significantly, genes mapped to biological processes of the steroid and/or lipid metabolism. but also other processes as immune response, regulation of transcription and translation, and intracellular signal transduction with most genes mapping to g-protein related go terms, were significantly affected.

re-evaluation of microarray data with real-time pcr
selected, differentially expressed transcripts were re-analyzed with qpcr. besides re-evaluation of the pooling approach, transcript concentrations were also determined in ten individual samples of each line to estimate inter-individual variation. altogether,  <dig> probe sets were selected for qpcr re-evaluation according to the following criteria:  probe sets should preferably represent transcripts of well defined genes;  selected transcripts should cover a wide range of transcript abundance;  about half of them should be up and half of them down regulated in fl1;  probe sets should map to different go terms.

for re-evaluation of the pooling approach, the samples were freshly assembled to  <dig> pools of each line, as described for microarray analysis. the qpcr data showed a strong and significant  correlation with microarray data in twelve of the fifteen transcripts . three of the transcripts however, bcl <dig>  pi4k2b and rgs <dig>  did not show any association between microarray and qpcr data. a comparison of the mean values that were calculated from all six pools of each line revealed that only eleven of the fifteen transcripts showed significantly different expression levels in both lines. obviously, these differences between microrray and qpcr analysis were only found in transcripts with generally low expression levels. the relative transcript abundance  varied between fc values of - <dig>  to  <dig> . generally, these relative expression levels were similar to those found by microarray analysis. only in case of ifi <dig> the fc value calculated from qpcr data was much higher than that calculated from microarray data . this might be due to the limited dynamic range of the hybridization technique used for microarray analysis compared to the range of qpcr, which can exceed more than  <dig> orders of magnitude.

qpcr analysis of individual samples showed similar line-specific differences as the qpcr pooling approach . however, line-specific inter-individual variations were considerably higher than line-specific inter-pool variations. thus the coefficients of variation of qpcr data from individual samples were higher throughout all levels of expression than those from pooled samples . this also resulted in partially higher p values  and thus lower levels of significance when comparing mean values of both lines.

discussion
during the present study comparative whole genome expression profiling was used to identify ovarian genes, whose expression pattern was affected by long term selection towards increased fertility performance. mapping of these genes to the hierarchical go terms could elucidate biological processes that might be responsible for the largely improved fertility performance in fl <dig>  it cannot be completely excluded however, that some of these line-specific differences are due to undirected allelic drift as a consequence of genetic separation of both lines over many generations. in any case, the data from the present expression profiling approach will also crucially support ongoing association studies to clearly identify candidate genes and causative polymorphisms, which are actually responsible for the largely improved fertility performance in fl <dig> 

microarray expression profiling
numerous of the differentially expressed genes, which had been identified by microarray expression profiling are known to be involved in female reproductive processes as folliculogenesis, ovulation, atresia, luteinization, or luteal regression and thus might play a role in increasing the ovulation number. hereafter, a selection of these genes will be discussed:

b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig>  and caspase  <dig> , can be assigned to the process of apoptosis. members of the bcl <dig> and casp families are well known to play a fundamental role during follicular atresia  <cit> , but also throughout earlier stages of folliculogenesis  <cit> .

inhibin β-b , which was found down regulated in fl <dig> ovaries compared to those of the control, significantly maps to go terms related to oocytes and follicle development. it is an important negative regulator of fsh release and thus is essentially involved in the regulation of folliculogensis and estrous cycle  <cit> .

cyclin d <dig>  is known to be essentially involved in granulosa cell differentiation. the gene is induced by fsh and regulates cell proliferation in gonads  <cit> . consequently, the absence of a functional gene in -/- mutant females leads to sterility  <cit> . down-regulation of ccnd <dig> by dihydrotestosterone induces cell cycle arrest in granulosa cells  <cit> .

glutathione peroxidase  <dig>  and peroxiredoxin  <dig>  are involved in the antioxidant defense and may play a role in protecting cells of the cumulus-oocyte complex but also luteal cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death  <cit> .

gulonolactone  oxidase  has also been found being expressed in the ovary  <cit> . it is involved in l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis, which can influence ovarian aromatase activity  <cit> .

seven genes were found to map to go terms related to the immune system, five of them with significant p-values. differential expression of three of them could be confirmed with qpcr. histocompatibility  <dig> k <dig> k region  and histocompatibility  <dig> q region locus  <dig>  are involved in the process of antigen presentation. a possible functional role of these genes for reproductive performance is not clear yet. interferon activated gene  <dig>  and interferon activated gene  <dig>  are target genes of the jak/stat intracellular signaling pathway that can be activated by the cytokine gamma interferon, a major player of immune cell signaling. alternatively, the jak/stat pathway can also be activated by insulin like growth factor  <dig>   <cit> . igf <dig> however is an important growth factor during folliculogenesis. therefore the igf <dig> signaling pathway might be affected by selection for increased fertility. this view is supported by significant up-regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  another player of the igf/jak/stat/ifi pathway. as also shown by microarray analysis, but particularly by qpcr re-evaluation, ifi <dig> is dramatically up-regulated in the high fertility line thus strongly suggesting a functional role of this gene for fertility performance.

cadherin  <dig> , a member of the cadherin family might play a functional role similar to n-cadherin, which was found to be expressed in granulosa cells and oocytes mediating cell to cell contacts  <cit> .

gtp cyclohydrolase  <dig> , guanine nucleotide binding protein β  <dig> , guanine nucleotide binding protein β  <dig> , guanylate cyclase  <dig> soluble α  <dig> , guanylate cyclase  <dig> soluble β  <dig> , iq motif containing gtpase activating protein , prostaglandin f receptor , and regulator of g protein signaling  <dig>  are involved in the g protein signaling pathways. this suggests that g protein signaling was actually affected by selection towards high fertility and might be important for increased reproductive performance in fl <dig> 

a large group of genes maps to go processes of the lipid and particularly steroid metabolism. steroids are important regulators of folliculogenesis and luteal differentiation. transcript levels of the niemann pick type c <dig>  gene that is involved in sterol trafficking, and of the cyp11a <dig> gene encoding the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which catalyzes an initial step of steroid hormone synthesis, were found to be up-regulated in fl <dig>  most interestingly, also the expression of an important transcriptional regulator of steroid biosynthesis, the nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig> group a member  <dig>  was found significantly changed in ovaries of fl <dig>  nr5a <dig>  also known as liver receptor homologue  <dig> , shows high level expression in ovarian cells. it is regulated by fsh, luteinizing hormone  and prolactin, and is known to regulate important steroidogenic genes as star, cyp11a <dig>  cyp <dig>  hsd3b, or cyp <dig>  <cit> . nr5a <dig> knockout is lethal in homozygotes and leads to reduced female fertility in heterozygote animals  <cit> , most likely because of altered luteal function due to reduced progesterone production. this suggests that steroid hormone production was affected by selection towards increased fertility performance. however, there is no conclusive explanation for the contradictory observation that expression of nr5a <dig> is up-, but that of cyp11a <dig> is down-regulated in fl <dig>  in spite of the fact that nr5a <dig> is a positive regulator of steroidogenic genes.

it is well known that camp responsive element binding proteins are essentially involved in fsh signaling in ovarian granulosa cells  <cit> . expression of the camp responsive element binding protein  <dig>  was found largely up-regulated in ovaries of fl <dig> thus suggesting, that the fsh signaling cascade that is essential for follicular growth and differentiation might be affected, possibly enhanced, by selection towards increased fertility. another interesting transcriptional regulator, which might influence reproductive performance, is the rar-related orphan receptor alpha gene . mutations of this gene result in the "staggered" phenotype in mice, which is characterized by cerebellar abnormalities. in addition, "staggered" mothers produce smaller litters and a reduced number of oocytes thus indicating pleiotropic effects of rora on fertility performance  <cit> . expression of the runt related transcription factor  <dig>  in follicular cells has been well documented. this factor seems to play an important role in the preovulatory process by regulating lh induced progesterone production  <cit> . however, significantly reduced expression of runx <dig> transcripts in ovaries of fl <dig> animals could not be unambiguously confirmed by qpcr.

a member of the retinol dehydrogenase family, rdh <dig>  was identified by microarray analysis in polycystic ovary syndrome theca cells  <cit> , where it affects steroid synthesis. over expression of rdh <dig>  that was found four-fold up-regulated in ovaries of fl <dig> thus suggests again, that steroid synthesis has been affected by selection towards improving fertility performance. stanniocalcin  <dig>  is known to be expressed in thecal interstitial cells. this paracrine hormone binds to receptors that are located in the granulosa cell layer, where it may act as a luteinization inhibitor  <cit> . stc <dig> knockout experiments however revealed, that this gene is not essential for reproduction and development in mice  <cit> , but it may modulate follicular differentiation and may therefore be important for reproductive performance.

re-evaluation by qpcr
by qpcr re-evaluation the majority of microarray data could be confirmed. however in three out of the  <dig> genes, qpcr data do not correlate with microarray data. noticeably, two of these genes, bcl <dig> and pi4k2b, showed very low transcript abundance levels. probably, these levels may fall below a technical threshold and therefore do not allow a reliable transcript quantification particularly by hybridization based methods as microarray analysis. thus expression data at these particularly low levels should be interpreted with care. microarray and qpcr data of other transcripts however showed significant correlations, particularly those with intermediate and high expression levels. therefore this re-evaluation indicated that the microarray based differential expression profiling basically yielded reliable data.

in addition to re-evaluation, qpcr was also used to estimate inter-individual variability of transcript abundance. the pooling approach applied for qpcr was identical to that for microarray analysis. the line-specific mean transcript levels were similar in both experimental approaches. however, the inter-individual variability was much larger than the variability between different sample pools of the same line. particularly cyp11a <dig>  ptgfr, and inhbb, but also nr5a <dig> and ccnd <dig> showed very large inter-individual variability. remarkably, this inter-individual variability was especially distinct in the control line. thus far however, we have no well-founded explanation for this observation. as a consequence of this very large inter-individual variability, the significance of comparative statistics  was considerably lower . in case of the prostaglandin f receptor , despite of very different mean expression levels between both lines, this difference was only significant when sample pools instead of individual samples were compared. this suggests that large inter-individual variation of expression levels can obscure group-specific differences. this is in line with an earlier observation  <cit>  stating that pooling is beneficial when many subjects, i.e. more than  <dig> to  <dig>  are pooled.

CONCLUSIONS
 the ovarian expression levels of numerous genes, which are involved in steroid/lipid metabolism, immune response, g-protein signaling and other biological processes were significantly different in the selected high fertility mouse line fl <dig> compared to a non-selected control line. this suggests that at least some of these genes and the corresponding biological processes play a functional role in improving reproductive traits, particularly by increasing the number of ovulation.

 selective qpcr re-evaluation largely confirmed the microarray data and in addition demonstrated that sample pooling allows the inclusion of more individuals into expression profiling analysis with simultaneous reduction of costs and can be beneficial to find out group-specific expression profiles despite of large inter-individual variation.

 combined with ongoing association studies in a fl1/duksi crossbreeding family the present data will substantially help to identify candidate genes and causative mutations that are eventually responsible for increased fertility performance in mice.
