BACKGROUND
quantifying the proportion of genetic variability that can be attributed to new mutations is a central question in evolutionary quantitative genetics  <cit> . mutational genetic variance defines the range of variation that can be explored by a population facing new environmental conditions and ultimately determines the rate of evolution of a population  <cit> . this mutational genetic variance both depends on the mutation rate and on the phenotypic consequences of the mutations . in particular, theoretical models predict that the amount of total expected genetic variance for a trait at selection/mutation/drift equilibrium is heavily dependent on the shape of the distribution of mutational effects  <cit> . numerous empirical studies have been undertaken to measure the rate and distribution of mutational effects in a variety of model organisms. these studies are either based on comparative analysis of sequences from different species, or on mutation and selection experiments.

comparative analyses of sequences rely on the comparison of species pairs with known divergence and aim at identifying loci under selection during the past history of a species and more generally emphasized the role of selection in shaping molecular polymorphism patterns. the approach uses derivatives of the mc donald-kreitman test  <cit>  based on the comparison between the variation within species  and the divergence at both synonymous and non synonymous sites. an interesting outcome of this approach is the variation between the estimates of the rate of adaptive substitutions in different species. actually, the proportion of loci that have been submitted to adaptive evolution ranges from a few percent in arapidopsis thaliana and human, up to ≈ 50% in drosophila and microorganisms . comparative analyses of sequences have also been used to estimate the genomic rate of deleterious mutation u. from a comparison of  <dig> protein-coding sequences between human and chimpanzee,  <cit>  found a surprisingly high value of u . in addition, such approaches, applied to mitochondrial dna where deleterious mutations predominate, showed that the observed number of non synonymous substitutions fit well with a model in which the strength of selection is exponentially distributed  <cit> .

mutation  and selection  experiments start from a single homozygous individual and measure fitness related traits on derived progenies obtained from  random or directed mutagenesis ;  accumulation of mutations during a large number of generations carried out without directed selection in addition to minimizing the effects of natural selection ;  accumulation of mutations during a large number of generations carried out with selection on a particular trait .

mutation experiments  measure the fitness of a set of independently-derived single step mutants evaluated under various environments and provide with direct information on the distribution of mutational effects. using site-directed mutagenesis on a rna virus,  <cit>  showed that almost 40% of the mutations were lethal, but found a high proportion of beneficial mutations  that could partly be explained by the chimeric nature of the virus and its poor adaptation to the laboratory conditions  <cit>  demonstrated using pseudomonas fluorescens that, across various environments, the effect of beneficial mutations on fitness is exponentially distributed and characterized by many mutations with small effects and few mutations with large effects. those results are in accordance with the idea that beneficial mutations are drawn in the right-hand tail of the distribution of mutational effects, so that their distribution belongs to the exponential family, as predicted by the extreme value theory  <cit> . m a experiments consist in deriving single descent lines from one individual in controlled favourable conditions, therefore limiting the effects of natural selection. at the end of the experiment, each new line has accumulated mutations in a neutral fashion, i.e. regardless of their possible phenotypic effect. the variance between lines provides with an estimate of the mutational variance  <cit> . further hypotheses about the shape of the distribution of mutational effects allow to estimate the genome-wide mutation rate  and the average fitness effect of a mutation can be inferred from the distribution of fitness-related traits between the m a-lines  <cit> . m a experiments have been undertaken in d. melanogaster  <cit> , c. elegans  <cit> , e. coli  <cit>  and a. thaliana  <cit> . those experiments reveal that mutations alone can generate a considerable amount of phenotypic variability, and drive the derived lines several units of residual standard deviation away from the phenotypic value of the initial homozygous individual. interestingly, the estimates of the genome-wide mutation rate may vary from several orders of magnitude depending on the species and the trait under consideration . however, one has to be very cautious with such estimates. first, because they may heavily depend on hypotheses about the underlying distribution of the mutational effects, and second, because of possible bias due to statistical artifacts. in particular, there is still a controversy about the proportion of deleterious or slightly deleterious mutations as opposed to advantageous mutations resulting from m a experiments  <cit> .

selection experiments  directly address, for a given trait, the question of the rate of occurrence of beneficial mutations. for instance,  <cit>  observed the occurrence of  <dig> new advantageous mutations in an experiment of e. coli culture over  <dig> generations. in divergent selection experiments, the initial inbred is splitted into two populations, that are artificially selected for highest and lowest values of a given trait. the responses to selection in both directions, as well as the differences between high and low populations provide information on the variance created by mutation that can be exploited for selection. typical outcomes of such experiments are estimates of the so-called mutational heritability, which is the ratio of the input of mutational variance per generation over the residual variance vm/ve. classically, the slope of the response to selection provides with an estimate of heritability  <cit> . because selection experiments start from a fixed material , the only source of genetic variance that can be used by selection comes from new mutations and the mutational heritability can be estimated directly from the slope of the response to selection  <cit> . divergent selection experiments have been undertaken in d. melanogaster  <cit> , mice  <cit> , c. elegans  <cit> , and chlamydomonas  <cit> . the linear response rate is remarkably similar among experiments considering the variety of traits and organisms, and ranges between  <dig>  to  <dig>  phenotypic standard deviations per generation. corresponding estimates of mutational heritability falls in the range of  <dig> - <dig> to  <dig> - <dig> . all these experiments demonstrate that the input of new variation through de novo mutations is substantial and may explain part of the response to selection during the course of adaptation in natural populations. however there are growing evidence that adaptation also take place from standing genetic variation. one of the most well known examples is the changes in plant architecture during maize domestication. actually, these changes are governed by a major gene, namely tb <dig>  <cit>  for which the cultivated allele was found at low frequency in natural populations of teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize  <cit> . it was shown in a subsequent study by  <cit>  that a number of other domestication-related alleles are present as cryptic variation in teosinte populations. selection from cryptic variation can have important consequences on the patterns of molecular diversity. in particular, the molecular signature of selection is reduced when the polymorphism pre-exists the selective event and the mutant allele has increased in frequency before selection occurs. in some cases, typical patterns of soft sweep  <cit> , which are hardly distinguishable from patterns of neutral variation, can be obtained. the consequence of soft sweeps is an underestimation of the number of loci contributing to adaptation  <cit> .

flowering time is a key factor in the adaptation of plants to environmental conditions. during plant development, flowering time determines the end of the vegetative growth, i.e. the period during which a plant accumulates resources. it is therefore a key component of the life cycle, that needs to occur at the right climate period. maize , a cultivated annual and allogamous species, is a spectacular example of adaptation to an extremely wide range of climatic conditions. during the last century, intensive selection on flowering time has allowed the cultivation of this originally tropical plant in higher latitudes. southward and northward crop expansion was made possible by the fixation of alleles favouring flowering in longer days at lower temperatures, and by the elimination of photoperiod sensitivity. in europe, the range of variation for flowering time between the latest dent lines and the earliest flint lines that are currently used as parents of hybrids is about  <dig> days. maize flowering time is primarily determined by the timing of the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase of the shoot apical meristem  <cit> . flowering time is therefore a complex trait and has been extensively studied. several candidate genes involved in its variation have been identified through qtl metanalysis  <cit> .

in the present study, we were interested in the potential for response to selection of maize inbred lines, which are generally considered as a fixed material when used either for genetic analysis or in selection, but which may encompass some residual standing variation. our experiment differs slightly from classic se experiment because as opposed to long-term maintained laboratory strains for model species where conditions can be strictly controlled, we purposely used commercial maize inbred lines seed lots as initial populations. the aim was to document the relative contribution of standing variation and new mutations in the response to selection in this particular material. we undertook two biological replicates of a divergent selection experiment on flowering time starting from  <dig> maize commercial seed lots considered as inbred lines, an early american flint  and a late iodent dent . this selection experiment, starting from a supposedly fixed material, was set up fifteen years ago to  characterize the response to selection in two directions, early and late flowering;  elucidate the relative role of standing variation versus new mutations in the variability exploited in the response to selection;  better understand the genetic bases of flowering time variation. surprisingly, a significant response to selection was observed within a very short amount of time . such a fast response is partly determined by the segregation of alleles at a major flowering time qtl in the f <dig> population, but we also found consistent evidence of polygenic variation resulting from new mutations.

RESULTS
two maize inbreds f <dig> and mbs chosen as initial populations constituted  <dig> biological replicates of a divergent selection experiment. in each replicate, we selected an early flowering and a late flowering population , called hereafter the early f <dig>  the early mbs, the late f <dig> and the late mbs. our selection experiment was set up in order to evaluate the ability of a material supposedly fixed according to maize breeding criteria to respond to selection and to measure the mutational heritability. below, we first describe the demographic features of our experimental scheme. second, we report a surprisingly fast response to selection and investigate two alternative hypotheses that may explain it: the fixation of a pre-existing advantageous mutation with major phenotypic effect and the generation of new genetic variability by mutation at loci controlling flowering time.

effect of the selection scheme on the effective population size
in each population,  <dig> individuals were selected at each generation. in order to limit random genetic drift, an additional constraint on the genealogies was imposed in our selection scheme: we maintained at least two main lineages per population, so that all individuals of the current generation descend from at least two individuals selected in  <dig>  the late mbs population descends from three individuals in  <dig>  while the other populations  descend from only two individuals in  <dig>  genealogies of the individuals selected in  <dig> in all populations are given in figure  <dig>  from the genealogies of selected individuals, we estimated the effective population size of each population from the variance of the offspring number . the effective population size was extremely low during the first two generations, reflecting the strong selection. since  <dig>  it became slightly higher than expected in a pure drift model, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> .

effective population sizes were computed from the number of offsprings . heritabilities were computed as the ratio of the genetic variance between genotypes of the same population over the total phenotypic variance . phenotypic values were obtained from s <dig> progenies of each genotype evaluated in  <dig> and  <dig> . for the heritabilities, the character typing indicate the level of significance of the genetic variance: italic = non significant, normal = ≤ 5%, bold = ≤ 10- <dig> 

response to selection
phenotypic data collected on selfing progenies of all selected individuals of the early f <dig>  late f <dig>  early mbs and late mbs were analysed in an 2-year evaluation trial along with their initial inbred lines f <dig> and mbs. on average, flowering time for the control line f <dig> was  <dig> days, with a residual standard deviation of  <dig> . for the control line mbs, the average flowering time was  <dig> days, with a residual standard deviation of  <dig> . controls were further used to correct all phenotypic data for field heterogeneity. an anova on corrected phenotypic values was performed separately for the individuals derived from each inbred line to test for the effects of population , year of selection , and genotype within population and year of selection ). for both f <dig> and mbs derived populations, all the effects were highly significant, including the population by year of selection interaction .

for f <dig>  flowering time ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  genotypic values of the early f <dig> range from  <dig> to  <dig>  its mode is  <dig> and corresponds to the average flowering time of the control line. in contrast, genotypic values for the late f <dig> exhibit a much wider range of variation, from  <dig> to  <dig>  actually, the genotypic distribution of flowering time in the late f <dig> can be pictured as a mixture of two overlapping distributions, with some individuals characterized by a very late flowering time. tracing back the genealogy of those very late individuals , it appears that they all belong to a same subfamilly, with the individuals of the last generation sharing a single ancestor at generation g <dig> . based on this observation, we decided to separate the late f <dig> into two different populations, namely the late-vl f <dig>  comprising the individuals descending from individual # <dig>  and the late-nvl f <dig> comprising the rest of the population. for the late-nvl f <dig>  flowering time ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mode of  <dig>  for the late-vl f <dig>  flowering time ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the distribution is uniform. for mbs, flowering time ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> days in the early mbs, and from  <dig> to  <dig> days in the late mbs. the mode of each distribution are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. again, the mode of the distribution of the early mbs is close to the average flowering time of the mbs control line.

the total range of variation for flowering time was  <dig> standard deviations for mbs and  <dig> standard deviations for f <dig>  this observation is indicative of a fast response to selection. consistently, we pointed out a significant difference between early and late populations in the anova. in addition, the significant effect of the population by year interaction in both lines reveals that at least one of the  <dig> populations responded to selection. in order to quantify this response, a regression analysis of flowering time over the generation of selection  was performed separately in each population derived from each line. we performed two separate analyses for f <dig>  one with all genotypic values, and another one after discarding the late-vl f <dig>  results are reported in table  <dig>  a significant response to selection is observed in all populations, excepted the early mbs. interestingly, this response is stronger in the late populations than in the early populations. this asymmetry is well illustrated in figure  <dig>  when late-vl f <dig> individuals were discarded from the analysis of the late f <dig>  the average response to selection in the late-nvl f <dig> and the late mbs is of the same order of magnitude . by contrast, when considering all individuals in the late f <dig> population, the observed response to selection was much stronger , suggesting the existence of a polymorphic locus with a major effect on flowering time. finally, figure  <dig> also illustrates the linearity of the response to selection through time, despite the low effective population sizes, and a short time frame .

altogether, these results called for further investigation within the late f <dig>  in order to better understand the genetic bases of the differentiation between the late-nvl f <dig> and the late-vl f <dig>  we therefore searched for polymorphism at ten candidate loci for flowering time using rflp markers, and found one that segregates within the late f <dig>  apart from the discontinuity caused by this late-vl f <dig> within the late f <dig>  the linear response to selection in all populations clearly suggests a polygenic basis for flowering time, which we further analysed by estimating the mutational heritability.

validation of a candidate locus by association mapping
we searched for polymorphism at ten candidate loci for flowering time using rflp markers. markers were developed from  <dig> cdna probes and  <dig> additional probes obtained by pcr reaction on candidate genes zf l <dig> and zf l <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  among the  <dig> cdna probes tested, some of them  had fixed different alleles between populations issued from one parent  or the other , others were monomorphic, and one probe, namely qck5e <dig>  had fixed different alleles between the early f <dig> and the late f <dig>  this probe was also polymorphic within the late f <dig> population. we therefore decided to perform some additional analyses with qck5e <dig> in the late f <dig>  first, we genotyped n =  <dig> individuals of the initial seed lot using the same rflp procedure as described above, and we found one heterozygote at the qck5e <dig> locus. the frequency p of residual heterozygosity was therefore estimated as p =  <dig> . second, we genotyped  <dig> offsprings of each individual of the genealogy. the resulting genotypes and genotypic values obtained for  <dig> individuals  were used in an association mapping analysis to estimate the additivity aobs and the dominance dobs as described in . we found aobs = -  <dig>  while dobs value was close to zero  suggesting that the additive effect of the gene is fairly strong as compared to the dominance . the model explained 35% of the phenotypic variation. we addressed the following question: is the qck5e <dig> locus involved in the phenotypic variation for flowering time in our divergent selection experiment ? we compared our observed values of a and d to distributions generated for both the additivity and the dominance under the null hypothesis, h <dig>  of random segregation of alleles at this locus in the observed genealogy starting from  <dig> heterozygotes in  <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig> b, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  simulations performed under h <dig> gave an a value above aobs suggesting that the polymorphism at the qck5e <dig> locus is associated with phenotypic variation for flowering time. in contrast, for the dominance effect, it was not possible to reject h <dig> . therefore the effect of the qck5e <dig> is mainly additive: the average flowering time in the late f <dig> computed across all generations was  <dig> and  <dig> for both homozygotes, respectively, and  <dig> for the heterozygotes. finally, we asked whether this association resulted from selection at this locus or whether it resulted from random drift in the genealogy. in the late f <dig>  the frequency of the late allele increased from f <dig> =  <dig>   in the initial seed lot to f <dig> = 6/ <dig> =  <dig>  at generation g <dig> . we estimated the effect of drift on changes in allelic frequencies by simulating the allelic frequency distribution in a theoretical population with the same effective population sizes at each generation than the observed values in the late f <dig> . from the distribution obtained with  <dig>  simulations, the probability of observing f <dig> ≥  <dig>  starting from f <dig> =  <dig>  is below 1%. therefore, the observed association is unlikely to result from drift alone.

mutational heritability and evolution of genetic variation
the observed linear response to selection in all populations  implies the existence of genetic variation within each population at each generation. we used the phenotypic evaluation trial to estimate the genetic variance between selected individuals at each generation in each population. the resulting within population heritabilities estimates computed as in  are given in table  <dig>  they were significant at almost all generations for both lines, except in the early mbs, and all the values were surprisingly high. as expected from the asymmetry of the response to selection , the within population heritabilities were higher in the late than in the early populations. they were comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the two late populations , meaning that up to eighty percent of the phenotypic variation for flowering time is genetically determined. finally, the patterns of variation of the within population heritabilities correlate with the patterns of the response to selection. for example, the strong response observed during the first  <dig> generations of selection in the late f <dig> population  can be explained by correspondingly high values of within population heritabilities . at the opposite, the apparent lack of genetic variability at generation  <dig> in the early and the late mbs  might be partly responsible for the poor response to selection between generations  <dig> and  <dig> .

starting from a supposedly fixed material , we observed a significant genetic variation at each generation within three out of the four populations, namely the late-nvl f <dig>  the early f <dig> and the late mbs. this motivated us to quantify the input of new variation required to explain the associated response to selection for flowering time, i.e. mutational heritability. we therefore modelled the response to selection expected under an infinitesimal model with or without mutations, but taking random genetic drift into account. the upper bound for the mutational heritability was provided by a model in which all the observed variation is brought by mutations that occurred during our selection experiment , i.e.  =  <dig>  resulting estimates, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   are much higher than what is generally found in the literature . the lower bound for the mutational heritability is  =  <dig>  i.e. all the observed variation is coming from standing variation . finally, we assumed a non zero mutational heritability and estimated the upper bound of the initial genetic variance . this gave us three different estimates for the pair . the results are given in table  <dig>  they are in good agreement with previous observations: under model  <dig>  high values of the mutational heritability were obtained for the populations that best responded to selection , and low values for the early f <dig> . notice the similarities between the estimates of mutational heritabilities in the late populations of the two biological replicate experiments, f <dig> and mbs.

in order to check whether the response to selection could be attributed solely to standing genetic variation, we simulated possible outcomes of the selection experiment without considering the input of de novo mutations . in our simulations, we considered an initial population with np loci segregating, of which nh are heterozygous and  are fixed differences between the individuals. allelic effects were drawn in an exponential distribution to allow for unequal gene effects. they were further scaled to match the value of the initial heritability  estimated from the experimental populations. starting with a null mutational heritability, we observed a rapid exhaustion of the initial genetic variability leading to a decrease of the rate of the response to selection through time . the response to selection was therefore non-linear. in contrast, the response to selection in the experimental populations is linear through time  or increases after g <dig> .

in order to provide statistical support to these observations, we applied a linear segmentation regression  <cit>  on simulated data, as well as on experimental data. the rationale of this approach was the following: the segmentation model supposed a single breakpoint in the rate of response to selection between g <dig> and g7; applied to the observed responses to selection in the experiment, the segmentation model estimated the probability that the breakpoint occurs at g <dig>  g <dig>  ... or g <dig>  these probabilities were compared to the number of breakpoints occurrences at g <dig>  g <dig>  ... or g <dig> in the simulated data. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the probability distribution under the null hypothesis of no mutation differed from the probability distributions of the observed data. this was true for all sets of initial conditions . in particular, the probability that simulated data exhibited a linear response to selection was low.

a add = additivity within and between loci. dom = dominance of the most favourable allele. b 95% confidence interval is given between brackets.

each simulation is defined by an initial number of polymorphic loci np, an initial number of heterozygous loci nh and the experimental population from which the initial genetic variance was estimated. corresponding values of initial heritabilities  are given in . % simulations with linear response is the fraction of the  <dig> runs for which the model that minimizes aicc in the segmented regression is the one with a breakpoint at g <dig> or after, indicating a linear response to selection. average response is the average response to selection computed as in  for each run and averaged over the  <dig> runs. p value contains the percentage of simulations for which the average response to selection is lower than the one observed in the corresponding experimental population. when nh is too high, the simulated response to selection is always higher than the observed one. when nh is too low, the simulated response to selection is always lower than the observed one.

simulated data rather pointed out to a breakpoint at g <dig>  suggesting that standing genetic variation was exhausted with a greater probability after  <dig> generations of selection. the only exception was the early mbs population, where the best segmentation model was the occurrence of a breakpoint at g <dig>  consistent with the lack of significance of the response to selection in that population . note that if qualitative response to selection differed markedly between simulated and observed data, in many case, the average simulated response to selection was not quantitatively different from the observed response to selection. exceptions were simulations with ,  and , which had to be excluded from the analysis because the response to selection was either too high or too small as compared to the experimental one. when the number of heterozygous loci in the initial population increased, the percentage of simulations exhibiting a linear response decreased, and the average rate of response tended to increase . overall, three lines of arguments support the hypothesis that new mutations have contributed to the observed response to selection:  in the absence of new mutations, the response observed in the experiments could not be reproduced without supposing a high and therefore unlikely number of polymorphisms in the initial population;  in the subsample of simulations that displayed a quantitative response to selection similar to the observed response, non-linearities were observed in more than 75% of the simulations;  the pattern associated with genetic variance fluctuations over time differed between the simulations and our observed data  and stayed constant in the experiment ).

discussion
our study reports an original selection experiment conducted on a crop in open field conditions. by setting up this experiment, we aimed at investigating the rate and limits of the response to selection from a highly inbred genetic material. after only  <dig> generations of selection, we observed a spectacular response to selection and identified a mutation with a major late flowering effect.

the selection protocol  was applied to two different initial inbred lines, f <dig> and mbs, which constituted two biological replicates of the same experiment. commercial seed lots of f <dig> and mbs were taken as the initial populations. in maize, the classical breeding strategy consists in searching for new genetic combinations in the progenies of f  <dig> hybrids between already existing inbreds  <cit> . new inbred lines are obtained after several generations of selfing  from the f  <dig> hybrid. the seed lots that were used here were taken from inbreds that were maintained for about  <dig> years since their first registration. they may encompass residual heterozygosity or fixed differences at some loci, either for alleles that were present in the initial hybrid, or for new alleles generated by mutations during the selfing stages. de novo variability altering gene expression has been observed within inbred stocks of mice maintained over  <dig> generations of brother-sister mating  <cit> .

the selection experiment consisted in splitting each initial seed lot into two populations, one selected for earliness, and the other selected for lateness. in the early population, the  <dig> earliest individuals were selected and selfed to produce the next generation; in the late population, the  <dig> latest individuals were selected and selfed to produce the next generation. because of the selfing process, no recombination occurs between selected individuals, and each of the  <dig> resulting populations consisted in a set of independent lines. note that because of possible contamination in open field conditions, we applied a rigorous protocol for selfing leading to a contamination rate below  <dig> . the fact that we did not detect inconsistency between the phenotypes of the individuals and their genealogy strengthens the idea that cross contamination has not occurred between populations.

we observed a fast response to selection between early and late populations in both replicated experiments. such a fast response to selection from nearly fixed inbred material can be explained either by the existence of heritable genetic variation in the initial populations, or by the generation of heritable genetic variation through de novo mutations . while we expected de novo mutations to be the main cause of the response to selection, we found several lines of evidence suggesting the importance of initial genetic variation in this experiment. a striking feature of the late f <dig> is the occurrence of very late individuals  that all descend from a single individual at g <dig> . actually, 35% of the phenotypic variation within the late f <dig> population is explained by the segregation of  <dig> alleles at the qck5e <dig> locus which were both present in the initial seed lot. the rflp probe qck5e <dig> which was found polymorphic within the f <dig> initial seed lot, with one allele associated with the 'very late flowering' phenotype in the genealogy of the late f <dig> population  was designed from a maize cdna library  <cit>  and correspond to a candidate gene for flowering time in maize  <cit> . up to now, only a few mutations affecting flowering time have been identified in maize, and mostly confer an early flowering phenotype. id <dig>  which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, was cloned from a mutation leading to a lack of conversion of the apical meristem from a vegetative to a reproductive state  <cit> . two other mutants, dlf <dig> and lfy <dig> have shown specific but weak effect on floral transition, and the epc mutation reduces the duration of the juvenile vegetative phase without any effect on the number of leaves in the adult plant  <cit> . additionally, the vgt mutations  <cit>  strongly reduce the number of nodes, indicating that they affect flowering time by accelerating the vegetative to reproductive differentiation of the shoot apical meristem. the vgt <dig> mutation was identified as a  <dig> kb non coding region positioned  <dig> kb upstream of an ap <dig> -like transcription factor shown to be involved in flowering-time control  <cit> . finally, dwarf <dig>  a gene identified from a mutant and involved in the gibberellin pathway, was the first gene to be found statistically associated to flowering time variation in a panel of around  <dig> american inbred lines  <cit> . however, more recent analyses on broader maize panels revealed much lower and border-line significance  <cit> . we are currently trying to validate the implication of the qck5e <dig> locus in the genetic architecture of maize flowering time. preliminary results suggest that the delayed development of the very late f <dig> genotypes is due to a greater number of nodes accompanied by a delayed reproductive differentiation of the shoot apical meristem.

genetic polymorphism at the qck5e <dig> locus only explains part of the response to selection in the late f <dig> population. once the individuals of the late f <dig> that were homozygous for the 'late' allele at the qck5e <dig> locus  were discarded, we observed a linear response to selection in three out of the four populations . responses to selection in the two replicated experiments are remarkably similar. a strong linear response to selection of  <dig>  days per year for the late mbs and  <dig>  days per year for the late-nvl f <dig>  corroborates significant heritabilities found within populations . in the early populations the response is limited and significant only in the early f <dig> . we found significant genetic variance for flowering time within each population in the generations g <dig> and g <dig> of early f <dig> and early mbs replicates , consistent with pre-existing variability. finally, the analysis of the response to selection led to estimates of initial heritability at g <dig> comprised between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the residual variance . altogether, this indicates that a maize inbred line, which is generally considered by breeders as a fixed material, remains partially polymorphic, at least at loci involved in the determinism of flowering time. one possible explanation is that heterozygosity has been maintained from the initial f <dig> inbred by natural selection because heterozygosity at some loci confers a selective advantage over homozygosity, a phenomenon called heterosis. while heterosis is known to be important for many traits including flowering time determinism, it is worthwhile noticing that the effect of the qck5e <dig> is mainly additive  which does not support the maintenance of polymorphism at this locus by heterosis.

the consistency of the response to selection during seven generations cannot be explained solely by residual polymorphism in the initial seed lots but requires the input of new genetic variance by mutation . indeed, we have shown that a model considering standing variation as the unique source of genetic variation was unlikely to produce a sustained response to selection during  <dig> generation given the importance of random genetic drift, i.e. small effective population size, in our experiment . while this is not a formal proof, it strongly suggests that new mutations have contributed to the observed response to selection in  <dig> out of the  <dig> populations . we are currently analysing the genetic polymorphisms within the populations to quantify precisely this contribution. estimates of the mutational variance ranged between  <dig> .10- <dig> to  <dig> - <dig> units of residual variance per generation , and stand as higher bound to what was previously described in other species  <cit> . in regards with the small effective population size in our experiment, which ranges between ne =  <dig> and ne =  <dig>  the efficiency of selection likely results from a high mutation rate combined with large effects of beneficial mutations. a high mutation rate is consistent with the complexity of flowering time genetic determinism, with many possible targets for selection  <cit> . indeed, the more the number of genes that determine a trait, the more the number of potential targets for beneficial mutations. our experiment also strongly support the idea that beneficial mutations that are primarily fixed have large effects  <cit> . indeed, we found a major allele at the qck5e <dig> that explains up to 35% of the phenotypic variation. while population size necessarily constrains the adaptive potential and the dynamics of adaptation, theoretical results suggest that selection within small populations can increase the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations  <cit> . in our experimental scheme, if by chance an advantageous mutation occurs in a genetic background of an individual retained by selection, its initial frequency will immediately raise to 5% , therefore increasing its chance to become fixed. this may explain the fast response to selection observed in our experiment. overall, our results therefore constitute an experimental evidence for the adaptive potential of small, highly consanguineous populations.

a striking feature of our selection experiment is the asymmetry of the response to selection, characterized by a higher response in the late populations than in the early populations. such asymmetry in the response to selection is classically observed for quantitative traits  <cit> , and can be attributed to epistasis: whenever antagonistic or 'less than additive' epistatic interactions predominate, the response to selection in one direction is predicted to be much easier than in the other direction  <cit> . along the same line, we expect a diminishing return of mutation effect in the early populations and conversely mutations of high effect in the late populations  <cit> . the  <dig> initial inbreds f <dig> and mbs have been intensively selected for earliness  <cit> . any new allelic variant therefore occurs within an 'early' genetic background, which may either constraint or accentuate its effect on the phenotype, depending on the direction of selection. the asymmetry of the response to selection associated with a stronger response to selection in the late populations in both replicates  suggests that beneficial mutation effects are stronger when selecting for lateness in such an early genetic background. because both initial inbreds were early flowering, and therefore maladapted considering that the target of selection is late flowering, this observation supports previous findings in viruses that small maladapted populations are characterized by higher fixation rates of beneficial mutations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our experiment demonstrates that starting from a highly inbred material, it is possible within a few generations to create maize populations that strikingly differ from the initial seed lot for flowering time while preserving most of the phenotypic characteristics of the initial inbred. such material is unique for studying the dynamic of the response to selection and its genetic determinants. we found that, in addition to the fixation of a standing beneficial mutation associated with a large phenotypic effect, a constant input of genetic variance by new mutations has likely contributed to a linear response to selection over generations. elevated values of the estimated mutational variance suggest a high mutation rate consistent with the complex genetic determinism of flowering time. overall, our results provide a glimpse on the adaptive potential of extremely small populations, which may contribute to their persistence in natural conditions.
