BACKGROUND
the nuclear pore complex  is a huge multiprotein complex, which controls exchanges of macromolecules  between the nucleus and the cytosol in eukaryotes. it forms a doughnut-shaped, eight-fold symmetry structure composed of nucleoporins assembled in different kinds of complexes, forming a spoke/ring structure arranged around a central channel . whereas macromolecules readily diffuse through the npc when their molecular weight is lower than ca. 30 kda  <cit> , they need to interact with nucleoporin-associated receptors  to be carried from one side to the other when their molecular weight is larger than 40–50 kda  <cit> . the npc is organized in interconnected subcomplexes with distinct functions. some nucleoporins form the scaffold of the npc structure, whereas fg nucleoporins, which display large domains containing multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats, are involved in transport of macromolecules in the tunnel by binding to receptor-cargo complexes  <cit> .

the plant npc has recently attracted the interest of the scientific community due to the discovery of its contribution to several signalling pathways and, so far,  <dig> nucleoporins have been identified in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . plant nucleoporins are involved in cell responses to diverse hormonal signals as well as to biotic or abiotic environmental stimuli, such as auxin, symbiosis and pathogen attack . suppressor of auxin resistance  arabidopsis mutants, which were screened as suppressors of axr <dig> , happened to be invalidated in nucleoporin genes   <cit> . sar <dig> sar <dig> double mutants are deficient in mrna export. furthermore, regarding auxin signalling, the sar <dig> and double sar <dig> sar <dig> mutants display altered localization of axr3/iaa <dig>  which is an auxin response repressor from the aux/iaa family. in these mutants, axr3/iaa <dig> was not confined to the nucleus, as expected, but found throughout the cell, suggesting that aux/iaa repressors are not properly imported or poorly retained inside the nucleus  <cit> . a nucleoporin of inner filaments of the nuclear basket, named attpr or nua, is also involved in auxin signaling  <cit> , and the nua mutant is deficient in mrna export like sar <dig> and sar <dig>  <cit> . based on two-hybrid and genetic interactions, a functional relationship has also been suggested between atnup <dig> and hormonal  and light signalling  <cit> .

this work is focused on the fg nucleoporin atnup <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana, which is believed to be the orthologue of yeast nsp1p and vertebrate nup <dig> nucleoporins  <cit> . it is located in the central channel of nuclear pores, together with atnup <dig> and atnup <dig>  which are also fg nucleoporins  <cit> . atnup <dig> is not homologous to other arabidopsis fg nucleoporins, and it is the only one harbouring the nsp1-c domain characteristic of yeast and vertebrate nup <dig>  <cit> . arabidopsis atnup <dig> co-suppressors and mutants were reported to display a dwarf, early-flowering phenotype suggesting an important role in plant development  <cit> . overexpression of atnup <dig> in tobacco leaves causes severe tissue decay in tobacco leaves  <cit> . a systematic search for embryo-defective mutants also identified two atnup <dig> t-dna insertion mutants  <cit> . in this study, we addressed the role of atnup <dig> from the point of view of auxin response.

RESULTS
variations of atnup <dig> promoter expression
atnup <dig> is not present on the arabidopsis microarray chip  and we have therefore not been able to obtain traditional microarray data. however, there are a few tilling array data , indicating that the gene is expressed in flowers, seedlings and juvenile leaves, and to a lesser extent in adult leaves. in order to get more precisely the tissue-specific expression of the gene, transgenic plants expressing an atnup <dig> promoter::gus fusion were created. the gene contains  <dig> small introns, all located in the last third of the orf, at a minimum distance of  <dig>  kb from the atg. this distance, together with the negative imeter scores of these introns , make it unlikely that they might have a transcriptional activation function  <cit> . the activity of the gus gene under the control of atnup <dig> promoter region allowed detecting a specific expression pattern . indeed, in adult plants, gus staining was generally low, except in stipules at the base of cauline leaves, below flower buds . in other tissues, it was diffuse and preferably localized in developing organs, such as young leaves , flowers , and root tips . in young plantlets, a low-level expression could be detected in the area of veins at the cotyledon tip . at early stages, expression could be found in the embryo sac . the highest gus activity was observed during germination , at the junction between the hypocotyl and cotyledons . at the subcellular level, the atnup62-gfp fusion protein was distributed at the nuclear periphery, as expected  <cit> , with a clear punctuate pattern not previously observed . the same atnup62-gfp construct allowed detecting a broad fluorescence in the cytosol , which might be due to overexpression.fig.  <dig>

molecular characterization of the atnup62- <dig> mutant
the atnup <dig> gene displays a specific organization with two completely different zones. the first zone is intronless, represents the initial two thirds of the orf and encodes the fg repeat domain of the protein . conversely, the second zone harbours multiple small introns. the encoded sequence displays many acidic and basic amino acids forming the nsp1-c domain homologous to that found in the yeast nsp1p nucleoporin.fig.  <dig> analysis of the atnup <dig> mutant. a upper panel: structure of the atnup <dig> gene and position of the t-dna insertion in the salk_ <dig>  mutant. exons are represented by rectangles  and introns by black lines. 5‘ and 3‘-utr are thick red lines. the protein is composed of  <dig> amino acids. the orf regions encoding the fg repeat, serine-rich domain  and nsp1-c-like domain  are figured in pale green and yellow, respectively. the t-dna insertion site is indicated  with the sequence of the  <dig> bases just upstream of the insertion site, coming from our own sequencing of the junction region. the two pairs of primers  used for pcr are indicated. lower panel: rt-pcr amplification of rnas prepared from inflorescences of wild-type col- <dig>  and atnup62- <dig> mutant . left lanes : after reverse transcription, pcr amplification was carried out using two couples of primers, a or b, for atnup <dig>  or a couple of primers targeting the ef1-α gene. right lanes : amplifications of wild-type and mutant genomic dna with primers b. ladder: 1 kb plus from promega, arrow at 1 kb. all amplified dna fragments are present in the gel at a position consistent with in silico prediction. b q-pcr analysis of atnup <dig> expression in different genotypes. results are expressed as fold changes compared to wild type. values are means and standard errors of two biological samples . c phenotype of atnup62- <dig> mutant and complemented plants, at the adult stage  and on in vitro germinations on ms/ <dig> medium . lower panels, from left to right: wild type, plantlets with  <dig> cotyledons and  <dig> cotyledon from the atnup <dig> mutant, plantlet with abnormal cotyledons from the 35s::atnup62-gfp line, close to a plant  displaying a normal appearance. arrows indicate abnormal plantlets. cotyledons of complemented plants are similar to those of wild-type plants



we tried to isolate homozygous plant lines for two different alleles, salk_ <dig> and salk_ <dig>  both displaying a t-dna insertion in the 5th intron. we were able to isolate viable homozygous seeds only from salk_ <dig> , in agreement with the previously observed lethal effect of the salk_ <dig>  mutation  <cit> . the third mutant, sail_127_f <dig> or atnup62- <dig>  displaying a  <dig> amino acid deletion, has a less visible phenotype compared to atnup62- <dig>  <cit>  and was not used in this study. rt-pcr  and quantitative real-time pcr results  indicate that the atnup62- <dig> mutant is not a bona fide knock-out plant but a mutant with reduced transcript levels. sequencing pcr products  at the exon 5-exon 6-junction region revealed no difference in sequence between the wild type and the mutant . thus, in the mutant plant, the 5th intron that contains the t-dna can be spliced exactly as the 5th intron of the wild type gene , albeit with decreased efficiency. real-time quantitative pcr results  allowed concluding that the atnup <dig> mutant displayed a strong reduction of the spliced transcript.

developmental defects of the atnup <dig> t-dna insertion mutant in reproductive organs and germinating seedlings
previous analyses of a suppressive mutant  <cit>  and two t-dna insertion mutants  <cit>  revealed the same phenotypic defects. all plants impaired in atnup <dig> function were small with reduced leaf blades and bolting occurred earlier than in the wild type.

we examined atnup62- <dig> plants at different growth stages. in vitro-grown mutant seedlings  displayed small cotyledons  and frequent abnormalities such as cotyledon malformations, fused cotyledons and polycotyly   <dig> cotyledons; fig. 2c and table 1). this change in cotyledon number is exceptional in wild-type col- <dig> plants . cotyledons of mutant plantlets also became epinastic . in the greenhouse on compost, at the rosette and subsequent stages, mutant plants had smaller leaf blades than wild type plants and flowering occurred earlier, as described previously  <cit> . besides, other anomalies were also detected. flowers were often abnormal and siliques much smaller than in wild type plants , with a longer desiccation time. we harvested 603 ± 15 mg of wild-type seeds per plant vs 270 ± 38 mg of mutant seeds from plants grown in parallel in individual pots. the atnup <dig> cdna under control of atnup <dig> gene promoter complemented the germination and adult plant phenotypes  as well as the cotyledon phenotypes.table  <dig> number of plants with cotyledon anomalies in the different genotypes

35s ::atnup62-gfp


interestingly, the 35s::atnup62-gfp transformed plant displayed a high level of atnup <dig> transcript , a marked phenotype of reduced growth at the adult stage  and an intermediate phenotype in cotyledons  .

the atnup <dig> mutant and the 35s::atnup62-gfp transformed plant are hypersensitive to auxin
auxin sensitivity of wild type and mutant plants was examined by growth on  <dig> -dinitrophenoxyacetic acid , a stable auxin analogue. on  <dig> and  <dig> nm  <dig> -d, aerial parts of wild type and complemented plants were moderately affected by the treatment, which mostly inhibited root growth .fig.  <dig> auxin hypersensitivity of the different atnup <dig> genotypes. a growth on vertical plates  on different concentrations of  <dig> -d. b primary root growth measurements on plantlets grown on agar ms/ <dig> medium containing different concentrations of  <dig> -d . data are means ± se. c bright field images  and corresponding fluorescence images  in wild-type control plant  and a 35s::atnup62-gfp plantlet, on ms/ <dig> and  <dig> -d-containing medium. seedlings of comparable root size have been chosen. d gus activity under the control of dr <dig> auxin-responsive promoter in wild-type and atnup <dig> mutant genetic background. left, 11 day-old plantlets, right,  <dig>  day-old seedlings



root growth on vertical agar plates was compared at the different concentrations of hormone. whereas roots of col, atnup <dig>  complemented and 35s::atnup62-gfp transgenic plants were all affected in the presence of  <dig> -d, the effect was stronger in the mutant and in the 35s::atnup62-gfp genotypes, whose residual primary root growth on  <dig> nm  <dig> -d was only about  <dig> and 16 % of that on control medium, compared to about 40 % for the other two genotypes . a phenotype was also observed for the atnup <dig> mutant plants in cotyledons. these organs, already reduced and epinastic in the absence of auxin analogue treatment, became tiny and severely distorted on  <dig> nm  <dig> -d . despite their root phenotype similar to that of the mutant, the 35s::atnup62-gfp plantlets did not display the phenotype of small epinastic cotyledons . this paradox can be explained by the distribution of the atnup62-gfp fusion protein, which appears to be almost absent in cotyledons both on ms/ <dig> and  <dig> -d-containing media .

the dr <dig> synthetic promoter is commonly used to detect auxin activity  <cit> . in a wild type genetic background, gus expression under the control of dr <dig> can be detected in root tips, hydathodes and leaf margins . in cotyledons, intense blue staining was always restricted to leaf margins . homozygous atnup <dig> mutant seedlings harbouring the dr5::gus construct, compared to isogenic dr5::gus seedlings, displayed a higher gus activity in cotyledons, in which the staining extended towards the centre of these organs . this suggested altered auxin activity in the atnup <dig> plants. in young germinating seedlings, dr5::gus activity was restricted to the cotyledons, the root tip and the inner edge of the hypocotyl alongside the cotyledons, in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . the atnup <dig> mutation resulted in an extension of the staining to the external upper part of the hypocotyl, where atnup <dig> is expressed .

atnup <dig> is a suppressor of auxin resistance conferred by the axr <dig> mutation
the axr <dig>  gene encodes a subunit of the rub-activating enzyme, necessary for the auxin-dependent degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional repressors. axr <dig> mutants are resistant to auxin and also display a specific phenotype under standard growth conditions. this consists in a reduced height, defect in root gravitropism, abnormal inflorescences, low fertility  <cit> , and serrated leaves  <cit> . in contrast to axr <dig>  the atnup <dig> mutation conferred sensitivity to auxin. we therefore created the atnup <dig> axr <dig> double mutant. this mutant had lost the phenotype of leaf serrations . leaves were also frequently embossed and misshaped, suggesting additional developmental problems that were not present in the parent lines . most importantly, the auxin resistance of the axr <dig> mutant was reversed by the atnup <dig> mutation. indeed, axr <dig> plants had no apparent growth defect on  <dig> nm  <dig> -d whereas double mutant plants were sensitive to the auxin analogue treatment . the restoration of root sensitivity was partial on  <dig> nm  <dig> -d but complete on  <dig> nm . q-pcr analyses also revealed that the double mutant had a less reduced amount of atnup <dig> transcript compared to the atnup <dig> single mutant .fig.  <dig> effect of the atnup62- <dig> mutation on the axr <dig> mutant phenotype. a plants grown in the greenhouse. the lower panels show the disappearance of the serrated margins of axr <dig> plants in the atnup <dig> axr <dig> double mutant. b in vitro-grown plantlets on ms/ <dig> medium supplemented with different concentrations of  <dig> -d. c restoration of auxin sensitivity of primary root growth by the atnup62- <dig> mutation in the axr <dig> mutant. data are means ± se. d q-pcr analysis of atnup <dig> gene expression in axr <dig> and the double atnup <dig> axr <dig> mutant. data are means ± se of two biological samples 



axr <dig> mediates auxin response by activating the scf e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the aux/iaa repressors of auxin response for ubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . in the auxin signalling cascade, this scf complex is composed of skp1/ask <dig>  the cullin cul <dig> and the tir <dig> f-box protein that specifically recognizes the aux/iaa proteins to be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. a two-hybrid screening with atnup <dig>  one of the other two fg nucleoporins of the central channel of the npc, resulted in the identification of atnup <dig> , skp <dig>  and one of its homologues   <cit> . skp <dig> was found  <dig> times in that screening, always in frame with the activation domain of gal <dig>  from different positions in its sequence . we therefore tested the hypothesis of an interaction between atnup <dig> and skp <dig> , in both bait/prey combinations. atnup <dig> displayed a strong intrinsic transcriptional activity, leading to growth on medium lacking histidine . the presence of skp <dig> fused to the gal <dig> activator domain  did not increase the signal. in the reciprocal test, skp <dig> displayed a weak transcriptional activity, which was not enhanced by atnup <dig> .

discussion
atnup <dig> expression and plant phenotype
atnup <dig> is an essential gene, as demonstrated by the lethality of two out of four t-dna insertions  <cit> . the developmental phenotype we observed for the atnup62- <dig> mutant  is in accordance with the localization of atnup <dig> promoter expression in the embryo sac and with the “embryo-defective” phenotype evidenced by the seedgenes project  <cit> . another mutant, atnup62- <dig>  harbouring a t-dna insertion in the same intron as atnup62- <dig>  displays a more severe “embryo-defective” phenotype  <cit> , leading to lethality . the presence of a residual ability to splice the fifth intron in atnup62- <dig> might explain this phenotypic difference between the two mutants.

it also seems difficult to obtain plants that deeply overexpress the atnup <dig> protein. zhao and meier  <cit>  obtained co-suppressors, but not overexpressors, by a strategy of plant transformation with a 35s::flag-atnup <dig> construct. overexpression of atnup <dig> by inoculation in tobacco leaves leads to very severe necrosis  <cit> . despite the high level of atnup62-gfp transcript , the similitude of the phenotypes of atnup <dig> and 35s::atnup62-gfp lines indicates that the latter are loss-of-function rather than strong gain-of-function lines , suggesting a dominant negative effect.

the localization of atnup <dig> expression in the embryo sac and young seedlings  is consistent with the embryo-defective phenotype, cotyledon and plantlet developmental defects. interestingly, the atnup <dig> promoter activity is concentrated in tissues that synthesize, accumulate or transport auxin. cotyledon tips and embryos are specific expression sites for expression of yucca genes encoding enzymes in the auxin synthesis pathway  <cit> . in the root apex  <cit>  and germinating seedlings  <cit> , the atnup62::gus activity does not match with the dr5-gus activity, but encompasses zones of active auxin transport . stipules of rosette leaves have been reported, from the activity of the dr <dig> auxin-responsive promoter, to accumulate free auxin  <cit> , and have been postulated to regulate adjacent organ development  <cit> . auxin is produced in flower organs, especially stamens  <cit> , but a role of stipules of cauline leaves in flower development is not excluded.

atnup <dig> and auxin signalling
it has been previously reported that some scaffold nucleoporins or npc-associated proteins, atnup160/sar <dig>  atnup96/sar <dig>  <cit> , atnup <dig>  <cit> , and attpr  <cit> , are involved in auxin responses. all mutants in these genes have in common the partial suppression of the axr <dig> auxin resistance phenotype. the present results provide several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that atnup <dig> also plays a role in auxin signalling. developmental defects, such as reduced size, small leaves  <cit> , abnormal flowers  <cit>  and early flowering  <cit>  suggested that atnup <dig> could interfere with auxin distribution or signalling. the embryo and cotyledon phenotypes of the atnup <dig> mutant are reminiscent of those of mdr <dig> and pin <dig> mutants impaired in polar auxin transport  <cit>  and yucca mutants impaired in auxin synthesis  <cit> . cotyledon epinasty is one of the symptoms of auxin excess  <cit> , also displayed by the atnup <dig> mutant  <cit> , whereas the appearance of extra cotyledons is a sign of dysfunction in auxin distribution  <cit> . indeed, cotyledons, which are formed at the triangular stage of embryo development , emerge from spots of auxin accumulation at the two side apexes of the triangle  <cit> . the atnup <dig> mutation suppresses phenotypic traits of the axr <dig> mutant, notably the auxin resistance, but also the typical serrated leaf phenotype that is auxin-dependent  <cit> . finally, both atnup <dig> mutant plants and the 35s::atnup62-gfp plants are hypersensitive to auxin. this phenotype seems to be rather specific. indeed, atnup160/sar <dig> and atnup96/sar <dig> do not display auxin hypersensitivity  <cit> . among nucleoporin gene mutants, only atnup <dig> was reported to be more sensitive than the wild type  <cit> . interestingly, atnup <dig> is the only known nucleoporin that binds to atnup <dig>  and reciprocally  <cit> . hypersensitivity to auxin was also observed in mutant plants impaired in auxin membrane secretion  <cit>  or control of aux/iaa degradation  <cit> .

an additional phenotype of the atnup160/sar <dig> and atnup96/sar <dig> mutants is the accumulation of mrnas in the nucleus  <cit> . however the atnup62- <dig> mutant does not accumulate nuclear mrnas  <cit> . the same holds true for atnup62- <dig> and mutants deficient for genes encoding other nucleoporins of the central channel of the npc  <cit> . this suggests that accumulation of mrnas in the nucleus and auxin-related phenotypes are independent phenomena.

elucidation of the molecular basis of the relationship between atnup <dig> and auxin signalling will need further investigations. essential genes are statistically prone to be highly connected in gene networks  <cit> . atnup <dig> is notably connected to genes encoding nuclear pore proteins, and those involved in embryo development and protein ubiquitination . the decrease of atnup <dig> transcript thus probably affects several networks. in order to address the molecular mechanisms affected in nucleoporin mutants, parry  <cit>  published a transcriptional analysis of atnup160- <dig> and atnup62- <dig>  surprisingly, only a few genes displayed a more than twofold change in gene expression compared to the wild type. among these, in a list of  <dig> genes up-regulated in both mutants, five were involved in nuclear transport and two  were auxin-responsive. the identification of other targets would probably require tissue-specific rnas or sampling at early stages .

we propose that atnup <dig> would act as a negative regulator of some auxin responses, like nucleoporins atnup160/sar <dig> and atnup96/sar <dig>  <cit> . the negative role of these two nucleoporins in auxin signalling has been ascribed to the fact that these proteins are involved in the retention of the transcriptional regulator aux/iaa <dig> inside the nucleus. the suppression of the axr <dig> phenotype by the atnup <dig> mutation suggests that atnup <dig> also acts downstream of axr <dig>  the mechanisms that could underlie such a control needs to be better resolved, but two-hybrid interaction experiments with atnup <dig>  <cit>  and the absence of evidence for a direct interaction of atnup <dig> with skp <dig>  suggest that atnup <dig> might modulate the activity or nuclear retention of skp <dig> in part via its interaction with atnup <dig>  this is corroborated by the similitude of plant phenotypes . it is not excluded that atnup <dig> might also interfere with skp1-like proteins   <cit> , and/or some target components of the auxin signalling pathways, tir/afb receptors , aux/iaa repressors  and arf transcriptional factors  which form a complex combinatorial network, displaying specific expression patterns and involved in different types of responses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide a first explanation for the lethality of knock-out atnup <dig> mutants, by highlighting its role in auxin-dependent development, especially at early stages. in the auxin signalling pathway, atnup <dig> would act downstream from axr <dig>  this also suggests that this plant fg nucleoporin, in close connexion with atnup <dig> and in relation to scaffold nuclear pore components , is able to take part in the control of other skp1-dependent regulatory pathways, at the time and in the place where regulations are required.
