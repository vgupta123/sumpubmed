BACKGROUND
as a common pathogen responsible for a wide range of clinical illnesses, k. pneumoniae has long been the principal cause of pneumonia  <cit> , emerging as the major pathogen associated with pyogenic liver abscesses over the past decade  <cit> . k. pneumoniae has been implicated in 7-12% of hospital-acquired pneumoniae in icus in the united states  <cit> , accounting for  <dig>   <dig>  and 34% of community-acquired pneumoniae in singapore  <cit> , africa  <cit> , and taiwan  <cit> , respectively. in the  <dig> s, k. pneumoniae surpassed e. coli as the number one isolate from patients with pyogenic liver abscesses in taiwan  <cit> , where more than  <dig>  cases have been reported  <cit> . liver abscesses caused by k. pneumoniae  have become a health problem in taiwan and continue to be reported in other countries. metastatic lesions, such as meningitis and endophthalmitis, develop in 10-12% of kla patients and, worsening the prognosis of this disease  <cit> . cases of kla in taiwan typically occur in diabetic patients with a prevalence rate from 45% to 75%  <cit> .

diabetes mellitus , the most common endocrine disease, is a predisposing factor for infections of k. pneumoniae  <cit> . type  <dig> diabetes  is a form of dm resulting from autoimmune triggered destruction of insulin-producing β cells of the pancreas. type  <dig> diabetes  is characterized by high blood glucose within the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. in  <dig>  approximately  <dig> million people in the united states were affected by diabetes, and this number is expected to grow to 366- <dig> million by  <dig>  <cit> . diabetes can lead to a variety of sequelae, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and numerous cardiovascular complications, and patients with diabetes are more prone to infection. several factors predispose diabetic patients to infection, including genetic susceptibility, altered cellular and humoral immune defense mechanisms, poor blood supply, nerve damage, and alterations in metabolism  <cit> .

clinical k. pneumoniae isolates produce significant quantities of capsular polysaccharides . several cps-associated characteristics have been identified in correlation with the occurrence of kla, including serotype k <dig> or k <dig>  <cit>  and a mucopolysaccharide web outside the capsule, also known as the hypermucoviscosity  phenotype  <cit> . we collected  <dig> non-repetitive isolates from the foci of k. pneumoniae-related infections. interestingly, the incidence of strains displaying the hv phenotype in the k. pneumoniae abscess isolates was 51% , which was significantly lower than that reported by yu et al.   <cit>  and fang et al.   <cit> . a decline in the hv-positive rate suggests the emergence of etiological hv-negative strains and urges a re-evaluation of whether the hv phenotype acts as a virulence determinant for clinical k. pneumoniae isolates. due to the significant susceptibility of diabetic patients, this study established two infection models recapitulating pneumonia and kla in diabetic and naïve c57bl/6j mice. the role of the hv phenotype in the pathogenesis of k. pneumoniae was determined in these mouse models by comparatively analyzing bacterial virulence for two clinically isolated k <dig> strains,  <dig> and  <dig>  which were well-encapsulated with similar genetic backgrounds; however, only  <dig> exhibited the hv-phenotype.

RESULTS
emergence of hv-negative k. pneumoniae related to tissue abscesses
to determine the clinical impact of the hv characteristics,  <dig> non-repetitive isolates were collected from consecutive patients exhibiting k. pneumoniae-related infections under treatment at a referral medical center in central taiwan, during april 2002-june  <dig>  of the clinical isolates, 7%  were kla strains, obtained from tissue-invasive cases presenting the formation of liver abscesses; 13%  were isolated from non-hepatic abscesses, including lesions occurring as empyema, endophthalmitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and septic arthritis, as well as lung, epidural, parotid, paraspinal, splenic, renal, prostate, muscle, and deep neck abscesses; 24%  were obtained from non-abscess-related cases, including pneumonia without abscess, primary peritonitis, cellulitis, biliary tract infection, primary bacteremia, and catheter-related infections; and 56%  were secondary k. pneumoniae infections. the hv-phenotype of the  <dig> strains was determined using the string-forming test . interestingly, the hv-positive rate in the tissue-abscess isolates  was only 51%, which was significantly lower than that reported by yu et al.   <cit>  and fang et al.   <cit> . in particular, the tissue-abscess isolates from diabetic patients were more frequently hv-negative than those from non-diabetic patients . moreover, hv-negative k. pneumoniae accounted for the majority of cases related to pneumonia  and secondary bacteremia  . although hv-negative k. pneumoniae are considered less virulent than hv-positive strains, our epidemiological observations indicate that k. pneumoniae strains displaying no hv-phenotype have emerged as etiological agents for tissue-abscesses.

analysis of comparative virulence for hv-positive and-negative k. pneumonia
under the premise that capsules are unaffected, we selected two clinically isolated k <dig> strains,  <dig>  and  <dig>  instead of using genetically manipulated strains to evaluate the role of hv phenotype in k. pneumoniae pathogenesis. both strains were well-encapsulated with the only phenotypic differences in the hv-phenotype, displaying a relatively high genetic identity  on their pfge-xbai pulsotypes among the  <dig> clinical isolates . bacterial virulence of the hv-positive strain  <dig> and-negative strain  <dig> was analyzed comparatively in a pneumoniae or kla infection model generated in either diabetic or naïve mice. a multi-stz injection method  <cit>  was used to induce diabetes in mice. the random blood sugar levels of the stz-treated mice was significantly higher than those of naïve mice at eight weeks  and thirty weeks  post-injection in conjunction with the classical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and hyperglycemia, exhibited in stz-treated mice, the body weight of the mice was also lowered significantly in a time-dependent manner . these results indicate that diabetes was successfully induced in these mice. to recapitulate a pneumonia infection, 30-wk-old diabetic mice or age-matched naïve mice were intratracheally inoculated with  <dig> cfu of k. pneumoniae  <dig>  or  <dig> . at  <dig> h post-infection ,  <dig> demonstrated a significantly higher proliferation of  <dig> in the lungs  and blood of naïve mice . however,  <dig>  had a significant growth advantage in the blood of diabetic mice compared to that of naïve mice . this growth advantage of  <dig> in the blood of diabetic mice was absent for  <dig> .

previous studies have suggested that liver abscesses are caused mostly by hv-positive k. pneumoniae  <cit> . nevertheless, 46% of our kla isolates lacked the hv-phenotype, which encouraged us to determine the importance of the hv-phenotype for k <dig> k. pneumoniae in the development of kla. based on the kla model established in our previous study  <cit> , 30-wk-old diabetic or age-matched naïve mice were orally inoculated with  <dig> or  <dig>  bacterial loads in the blood were determined at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi to evaluate the tissue-invasiveness of these strains. interestingly, 50%  of the 1084-infected diabetic mice developed bacteremia at  <dig> hpi with average bacterial load of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml , whereas only 14%  of the 1112-infected diabetic mice had bacteria in the blood . the enhanced invasiveness of  <dig> contributed to its virulence in diabetic mice, as  <dig> %  of diabetic mice succumbed to  <dig> infection, whereas none of the 1112-infected diabetic mice died before day,  <dig> post-infection . however, the superior virulence of  <dig> over  <dig> in diabetic mice was absent in naïve mice. compared to the presence of  <dig> in 70%  of the infected mice ,  <dig> was only detected in the blood of  <dig> %  of the infected naïve mice . seven of ten 1112-infected naïve mice died at day  <dig> but only one of the six 1084-infected naïve mice died at precisely the same time . regardless of the hv-phenotype, both  <dig> and  <dig> induced microabscess foci in the livers at seven days post-inoculation, compared to the control group , as significant infiltrates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were noted in either the diabetic mice  or the naïve mice .

requirement of hv-phenotype for k. pneumoniae  <dig> virulence
the hv-positive strain,  <dig>  demonstrated stronger virulence than  <dig> in naïve mice. to determine whether the virulence of  <dig> was determined by the expression of hv-phenotype, we isolated a mutant that lost its hv-phenotype from a mini-tn <dig> mutant library of  <dig> and designating it kpg <dig>  based on sequence determination, the mini-tn <dig> in kpg <dig> was inserted into the reading frame of pgi. glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, encoded by pgi, is one of the key enzymes responsible for exopolysaccharide synthesis of klebsiella  <cit> . compared to its parental strain  <dig>  the hv-negative mutant kpg <dig> was more sensitive to serum-killing and its virulence in naïve balb/c mice was significantly attenuated with >  <dig> fold increase in the oral ld <dig> . additionally, the loss of hv-phenotype also impaired the anti-phagocytosis ability, as the intracellular survival of kpg <dig> was lower in raw <dig>  macrophages than that of  <dig> . these results suggest that the hv-phenotype was a virulence determinant for the hv-positive strain  <dig> 

note. aif the bacteria examined showed a reduction of  <dig> log <dig> in the surviving counts after serum incubation, this strain was defined as serum-sensitive. if the viability of a strain remain > 90% after  <dig> min-treatment, the strain was defined as serum-resistant. bfive  <dig> wk old male balb/c mice of a group were orally inoculated with bacterial culture of a particular k. pneumoniae strain in 10-fold steps graded doses. the 50% lethal doses, based on the number of survivors after one week, were calculated by the method of reed and muench  <cit>  expressed as colony forming units . ca particular k. pneumoniae strain was used to infect raw <dig>  cells with m.o.i. =  <dig>  after stringent washes, the number of adherent and intracellular k. pneumoniae was determined before and after gentamicin treatment. the intracellular survival rate was calculated as 100% × .

discussion
a capsule-associated mucopolysaccharide web, also known as the hypermucoviscosity  phenotype, was previously considered a characteristic associated with pyogenic k. pneumoniae infections  <cit> . nevertheless, the prevalence of k. pneumoniae negative for hv-phenotype in our pyogenic cases  suggests that hv-negative strains have emerged as etiologic in the formation of tissue abscesses. hv-negative-associated infections were related to diabetic conditions, as diabetic patients suffering from pyogenic infections were more frequently associated with hv-negative strains than with hv-positive strains . therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess how essential the hv-phenotype is for k. pneumoniae pathogenesis by comparing the virulence of clinically isolated strains that were naturally hv-positive or -negative. because k <dig> is the predominant serotype in kla cases, we selected two k <dig> strains,  <dig> and  <dig>  which have relatively high genetic similarity among our clinical isolates. not surprisingly, the hv-positive strain  <dig> demonstrated greater virulence than the hv-negative strain  <dig> in either a pneumonia or kla infection model in naïve mice. however, in the kla model of diabetic mice,  <dig> was as potent as  <dig> in inducing liver abscesses, exhibiting an ability superior to that of  <dig> in causing bacteremia and mortality in mice. the advantageous tissue-invasive ability of  <dig> indicates that the hv-phenotype per se is not a determinant for k. pneumoniae virulence in a diabetic host.

genetic loci, including maga  <cit> , the cps gene cluster  <cit> , the wb gene cluster  <cit> , and rmpa  <cit> , have been associated with the hv-phenotype. mutations of these genes have resulted in the loss of the hv-phenotype in conjunction with defects in capsular integrity, confirming the findings of fang et al.  <cit> , who reported that capsule-related properties, including serum resistance, anti-phagocytosis, and virulence to mice, were drastically attenuated in the maga mutants. ideally, the capsule and hv-phenotype should be investigated independently. however, all of the hv-phenotype-associated genes identified thus far are involved in the regulation or the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides. given that significant quantities of clinically isolated k. pneumoniae are well-encapsulated but negative for hv-phenotype, these naturally- selected hv-negative strains could be used as an ideal control for hv-positive strains to minimize the influence of defects on the capsule. consistent with previous thoughts, the hv-positive strain  <dig> was more likely to cause pneumonia or kla in naïve mice than  <dig>  although the idea that the hv-phenotype is a determinant for k. pneumoniae virulence was suggested by the fact that the isogenic hv-negative mutant of  <dig>  kpg <dig>  notably lost its virulence to mice, we could not exclude the possibility that the mutation of pgi influenced the integrity of the capsule and disrupted the synthesis of exopolysaccharides as the anti-phagocytic ability of kpg <dig> in raw <dig>  macrophages was attenuated. unlike kpg <dig>  naturally-selected hv-negative strain  <dig> exhibited the wild-type level capsule-related characteristics, including serum-resistance, anti-phagocytosis, and virulence to mice. the findings suggest that hv-phenotype-related properties are not necessarily the same as the properties related to capsules. further studies are required to differentiate the roles of the hv-phenotype and capsule in k. pneumoniae pathogenesis.

diabetes is a risk factor for k. pneumoniae infections  <cit> . to clarify the role of hv-phenotype in diabetic individuals, we produced diabetes in mice using a stz-induction method  <cit> . the stz-treated diabetic mice were raised to the age of thirty weeks to avoid immunomodifying effects of stz occurring after administration of the drug  <cit> , to ensure the physiological properties of clinical diabetes occurring in mice, and to mimic middle-aged diabetic persons, the population most susceptible to k. pneumoniae infections  <cit> . in pneumonia or the kla model generated in the diabetic mice, bacteremia was more likely to develop following an intratracheal- or oral-infection with the hv-negative strain  <dig> compared to that of  <dig>  the pathological advantages of hv-negative k. pneumoniae in diabetic mice implies that diabetes might provide a specialized environment permitting these strains to disseminate from local tissues, such as the lungs and intestines into the blood. although previous studies have indicated that the hyperglycemic state of diabetes provokes a functional decline of neutrophils  <cit> , phagocytosis by neutrophils from diabetic patients of k. pneumoniae  <dig> was comparable to that of  <dig> . moreover, pulmonary infections caused by k. pneumoniae  <dig> and  <dig> caused similar apoptosis levels of the alveolar macrophages in both diabetic and naïve mice . given that capsules play a pivotal role in the protection of k. pneumoniae from phagocytosis  <cit> , it is not surprising that the well-encapsulated k. pneumoniae  <dig> interacted with phagocytes in the same manner as  <dig>  this implied that the hv phenotype was not essential for the antiphagocytosis of k. pneumoniae. thus, a mutant library of  <dig> generated using a signature-tagged mutagenesis technique is currently under in vivo screening in diabetic mice. identification of the genetic requirement of  <dig> with regard to virulence will provide insights into the means by which  <dig> gains an advantage in dissemination and proliferation in the blood of diabetic mice. to our knowledge, this is the first study using naturally-selected strains to evaluate the requirements of hv-phenotype for k. pneumoniae virulence in diabetic mice. our findings suggest that the hv-negative strain  <dig> is more virulent than the hv-positive strain  <dig> under diabetic conditions, the naturally-selected strain  <dig> may serve as an ideal model for identifying virulence factors, rather than relying on the hv phenotype that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of k. pneumoniae.

CONCLUSIONS
hv-phenotype is a virulent determinant for clinically isolated hv-positive k. pneumoniae. however, factors other than the hv-phenotype contribute significantly to the virulence of k. pneumoniae isolates displaying no hv-phenotype, particularly for systemic dissemination under diabetic conditions.
