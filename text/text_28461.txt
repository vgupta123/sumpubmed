BACKGROUND
acetylcholinesterase  is a serine hydrolase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. this enzyme is the target of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides which phosphorylate or carbamoylate the serine of the active site blocking the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. the post-synaptic membrane then remains depolarized and synaptic transmission cannot take place so the insect dies. these compounds are used to control proliferation of various agricultural pests: insects, acari and nematodes. one of the consequences is that pesticide residues remain in the environment and are potentially toxic for all animals, including humans since cholinergic transmission is well conserved. insecticide residues can be detected with biosensors using ache as biological element to detect low levels of contaminants in crops, soil, water or food samples  <cit> .

drosophila ache  was found to be the most sensitive enzyme when compared to enzymes of non-insect origin and in-vitro-mutagenesis has permitted the selection of enzymes up to 300-fold more sensitive  <cit> . but like most enzymes from mesophilic organisms, dmache is not stable, and this instability precludes its utilization in biosensors. it can be stabilized by additives: proteins such as bovine serum albumin, reversible inhibitor, polyethylene glycol or by encapsulation in liposomes  <cit> . another way to stabilize the enzyme is to use in vitro mutagenesis to modify the primary structure of the protein. elimination of a free cysteine and mutation of the hydrophobic residues at the protein surface into hydrophilic residues have been used to increase the stability of dmache  <cit> . here we focused on another method: engineering new disulfide bridges.

disulfide bonds are present in most extracellular proteins, where they presumably stabilize the native conformation by lowering the entropy of the unfolded form  <cit>  or by decreasing the unfolding rate of irreversibly denatured proteins  <cit> . this stabilizing property makes disulfide bond cross-linking an attractive strategy for engineering additional conformational stability into proteins by site-directed mutagenesis  <cit> .

dmache is a dimer linked to membrane via a gpi anchor. there are eight cysteines in each monomer  <cit> . six are involved in intrachain disulfide bonds, they are highly conserved in the protein family and their mutations result in inactivation of the protein. one cysteine is involved in an interchain disulfide bond and one, at position  <dig>  remains free  <cit> . the aim of this work was to stabilize dmache by introducing new disulfide bonds.

RESULTS
mutation
there are  <dig> potential disulfide bridges in dmache if we consider that every distance between two cβ of  <dig>  to  <dig> Å is suitable to form a disulfide bridge following the mutation of the two residues in cysteines. among them, we selected  <dig> using two criteria: the two amino-acids involved should not be conserved in the cholinesterase family and a serine at these positions is present in one of the available sequences  <cit> . all these  <dig> disulfide bonds were predicted by modip, automated software for modeling disulfide bonds in proteins  <cit>  with grades a , b  and c   <cit> . we verified that the engineered disulfide bonds were formed by assaying free sulfhydryl groups with the ellman reagent in the presence of  <dig> m urea. the results were consistent with the expected disulfide bonds. we verified that the new cysteines did not promote a higher degree of polymerisation. sds-gel electrophoresis performed in non-reducing conditions showed that all mutants were dimeric proteins like the wild type: introduction of cysteines did not provide additional intersubunit interactions in the mutants.

in our conditions, production of wild type dmache in insect cells via the secretory network is  <dig> nmoles per liter, five bridges did not significantly affect this protein production; two, m <dig> and m <dig> decreased production and no mutation increased production .

heat denaturation
we first analyzed denaturation with the most common method used to study protein denaturation: incubation at high temperature. the stability of the mutated protein was estimated by studying irreversible thermal inactivation at several temperatures  and plotted the first-order denaturation rate constant  against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature . it appeared that one bridge  increased thermostability while one  decreased it .

urea and organic solvent denaturation, protease sensitivity
stability was assayed with three denaturing agents. in all cases, denaturation was irreversible and followed apparent first order kinetics. stability was characterized by the half-life , the time at which 50% of an initial enzymatic activity is preserved. the half life of the wild type protein was  <dig>  min. in  <dig> m urea. protease was used as a denaturant because a protein's resistance to proteolysis increases with its conformational stability due to the fact that the susceptibly to proteolysis reflects the rate of local unfolding  <cit> . the half life of wild type dmache was  <dig>  min in  <dig>  mg/ml pronase. detection of insecticides in food requires their extraction with organic solvent. although the solvent should be eliminated before the assay, low amounts may remain in solution and inactivate the enzyme. we used acetonitrile as model because it is soluble in water. the half life of the wild type protein was  <dig>  min in 20% acetonitrile. the thermostability provided by bridge m <dig> is conserved for other denaturing agents . identically, the low stability provided by bridge m <dig> is found again. in addition, low stability was found for bridges m <dig> and m <dig> 

specific activity
the specific activity of the mutants, and the patterns of the ps curves, were not significantly changed with the introduction of new bridges . this suggests that entrance of the substrate into the active site as well as the catalytic efficiency was not affected by the mutations.

discussion
from the first works of villafranca et al.  <cit>  and perry and wetzel  <cit> , introduction of non-native disufide bonds has been used to stabilize proteins  <cit> . these successes pushed us to use this technique to stabilize dmache.

the effect of addition of disulfide bridges was either stabilization or destabilization
most new disulfide bonds introduced in dmache did not affect protein stability, one decreased stability. destabilization has sometimes been reported  <cit> . this instability has been interpreted as the result of atypical sets of dihedral angles in newly formed disulfide bridges  <cit> , from stabilization of the denatured state  <cit>  or from reduction of disulfide bonds followed by disulfide exchange or chemical reaction of the sh groups formed  <cit> . attempts to predict destabilization by modeling using modip failed, suggesting that selected positions were too flexible for a fulfilling prediction.

we found one mutation which stabilizes the protein . two subdomains forming the active site may be distinguished in cholinesterases and mutations decreasing interactions between them decrease protein stability  <cit> . disulfide bridge m <dig> links the two subdomains of the enzyme , strengthens subdomain interactions and increases overall stability. this suggests that the contact area of the two subdomains is the weakest site of the protein, taking into account the hypothesis that unfolding of a protein molecule starts at its weakest site, and local stabilization of this fragile region results in global stabilization of the whole molecule  <cit> .

addition of new disulfide bonds may impair protein production
production is a key issue for application of the stable enzymes in biosensors. we found that addition of a disulfide bond may result in a decrease of protein production since two mutations out of the seven studied, affected protein production. most probably, increasing the number of sulfhydryl groups in a protein decreases the folding efficiency by increasing the number undesirable disulfide bonds which results in a misfolded protein.

CONCLUSIONS
addition of a disulfide bridge may either stabilize or unstabilize proteins.
