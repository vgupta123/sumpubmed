BACKGROUND
male infertility is a significant problem in all mammalian species  <cit> . in humans, it is estimated that 15% of couples are infertile and in one third of these cases infertility can be attributed solely to the male partner  <cit> . in productive livestock the economic losses due to reproductive inefficiency in males can be substantial, particularly when infertility affects a genetically superior individual  <cit> . although some instances of male factor infertility can be explained by infections, environmental causes, immunological or hormonal deficiencies, many are caused by genetic factors. problems with the production and maturation of spermatozoa are the most common causes of male infertility resulting in a low sperm count, morphologically abnormal spermatozoa or reduced sperm motility  <cit> . despite efforts to reveal the genes involved in spermatogenesis and their functions, little is known about the underlying causes of male infertility. therefore, the localization and identification of mutations affecting specifically the spermatogenesis provide invaluable information for research on the causes of male infertility.

mammalian spermatogenesis is a complex process, where diploid spermatogonia develop into haploid, highly specialized spermatozoa. spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testis and can be divided in proliferative phase, meiotic phase and differentiation   <cit> . during the proliferative phase spermatogonia go through several mitotic divisions. the final mitotic division of differentiated spermatogonia gives rise to the primary spermatocytes. meiosis of primary spermatocytes leads to the production of secondary spermatocytes after the first meiotic division, while haploid round spermatids are formed following the second meiotic division. after meiosis, spermatids are connected with cytoplasmic bridges sharing transcripts and proteins  <cit> . in spermiogenesis the nucleus of the germ cell is remodeled and the acrosome and sperm tail are formed. finally, mature spermatozoa are released into the lumen of seminiferous epithelium and transported to the epididymis for further maturation. during the whole process, the expression and the interactions between various genes and their protein products are required and regulated in an ordered manner. some of these genes or their alternative transcripts are specifically expressed in the testis. identification of these genes and their roles is important in understanding the mechanism of spermatogenesis.

spermatogenic arrest at various stages of spermatogenesis is known to cause infertility in several mammalian species  <cit> , but only recently genes and interaction networks behind these defects have been under investigation. different mouse models have revealed several genes associated with male infertility caused by spermatogenic arrest  <cit> , but the full understanding of events leading to spermatogenic arrest at specific phases requires further studies. within the finnish yorkshire population several boars with azoospermia were identified during years 1995- <dig>  in this study we report an infertility defect in the finnish yorkshire boars caused by spermatogenic arrest  in early meiotic cells. the aim of the study was to identify the mutation causing the sa defect and reveal the role of the affected gene in spermatogenesis. the disease associated region was localized to porcine chromosome  <dig> within a  <dig>  mbp region and a promising candidate gene, testis expressed  <dig> , was identified. sequencing of the tex <dig> mrna showed a sa specific insertion in exon  <dig>  which resulted in a premature translation stop codon and decreased expression of the tex <dig> mrna and protein products specifically in the testis.

RESULTS
spermatogenic arrest in finnish yorkshire boars results in severe degeneration of germ cells
the infertility of sa affected boars was first identified in boar stations. the testicular size appeared to be approximately half of the normal size in affected boars and microscopical examination of the ejaculate revealed total absence of spermatozoa  <cit> . further histological examination of the sa affected testis sections showed markedly reduced number of late meiotic cells and absence of postmeiotic cells . furthermore, affected testes displayed severe degeneration of germ cells and vacuolization probably due to increased germ cell apoptosis .

genome wide association analysis localized the sa defect in porcine chromosome 12
call rate  was over 95% for all genotyped samples in this study. in the initial genome wide screen ,  <dig>  snps had minor allele frequency  >  <dig>  the manhattan plot of p-values of these snps is shown in figure 2a. in the initial gws  <dig> snps had p-value less than  <dig> e- <dig> that corresponds to bonferroni corrected overall p-value <  <dig>  . all the significant snps were located in a  <dig> mbp long region  on chromosome  <dig> except one snp on chromosome  <dig> . this single snp is most likely a false positive finding and was ignored in the later analysis.

when a larger control group was used in gws only two snps  supported a fully penetrant recessive mode of inheritance . all sa affected boars, but none of the controls, were homozygous for alleles c and a in alga <dig> and alga <dig>  respectively. additionally, all sa affected boars had two copies of the same haplotype containing  <dig> snps and all controls that were heterozygous for alga <dig> and alga <dig> had one copy of that haplotype . thus, there appears to be a single origin for the sa causal mutation.

haplotype  <dig> is the longest haplotype that is shared by all cases in this chromosome region. the snps that fulfil recessive mode of inheritance in the large data set are marked in bold face.

the sa associated haplotype covers a  <dig> mbp region in ssc  <dig>  which contains a large number of annotated genes . within these genes a promising candidate gene for the spermatogenic arrest, tex <dig>  was found at position 32834226- <dig> bp. tex <dig> has been shown to be crucial for successful spermatogenesis having a role in converting midbodies into stable intercellular bridges  <cit> . in addition, tex <dig> knockout mice have a similar spermatogenic phenotype  <cit>  as was seen in sa affected boars. one of the snps with a strong association with the sa defect, alga <dig>  also resides within the tex <dig> genomic sequence.

sa defect in the finnish yorkshire population is caused by an exonic insertion
the predicted pig tex <dig> transcript  contains  <dig> nt and  <dig> exons. sequencing of the control testis mrna of tex <dig>  showed a transcript including  <dig> nt. sequence alignment with the sequencer software  showed differences in exon content between the pig tex <dig> database sequence and our results. the testis mrna starts at exon  <dig> and one additional exon was present after exon  <dig>  in addition, the sequence of exon  <dig> was different in the embl transcript and in the testis mrna and exon  <dig> was missing in our data. the translation stop codon locates after position  <dig> nt in our testis transcript, thus the pig tex <dig> protein sequence in the testis contains  <dig> aa. the protein sequence contains ankyrin repeat region at position 1- <dig>  and pkc_like-domain at position  <dig> -  <dig> aa . sequencing of a control and sa affected boar samples revealed several polymorphisms within the coding region of tex <dig> . five of these polymorphisms lead to amino acid changes possibly affecting the protein structure and function. however, the most likely cause for the sa defect was found in exon  <dig>  in the mrna sequence of all sa affected boars a  <dig> nt deletion  and a  <dig> nt insertion  was found in the exon  <dig>  this del/ins resulted in a premature translation stop codon at aa  <dig> in the sa affected mrna .

the effect of the polymorphism on protein sequence and position in control transcript  and corresponding protein sequence are indicated.

the identified region containing the del/ins polymorphism in the tex <dig> mrna was further analysed in the genomic dna of all sa affected boars and a group of control animals . all affected boars had a homozygous  <dig> bp insertion within the genomic sequence of tex <dig> exon  <dig>  the insertion creates a novel exon/intron splicing acceptor site causing differential splicing of this exon in affected animals, thus creating the identified del/ins in the tex <dig> mrna . in control boars five heterozygous animals were identified and in  <dig> analyzed boars the exonic insertion was absent. in addition, dna from two sires of sa affected boars was available and both of these boars were heterozygous for the insertion.

in order to identify the origin of the  <dig> bp insertion, a blast search against the pig genome build  <dig> was done. the insertion sequence was found in the tex <dig> intron  <dig>  the presence of this intronic sequence in sa affected animals was confirmed by sequencing. thus, the causal mutation for spermatogenic arrest in the finnish yorkshire population appears to be a duplication of a  <dig> bp sequence within tex <dig> gene .

tex <dig> expression is decreased in the testes of sa affected boars
the expression of tex <dig> mrna was examined by rt-pcr on agarose gels and qpcr. both methods indicated clear reduction in tex <dig> expression in the sa affected testis . furthermore, tex <dig> protein product was absent in the testis of a sa affected boar . tex <dig> has a role in the formation of embryonic intercellular bridges, which are formed during the male and female gametogenesis  <cit>  indicating that down regulation of tex <dig> expression may also affect the female fertility. since no samples from homozygous sows for the tex <dig> insertion were available, we investigated the expression of tex <dig> in the ovary, oviduct and uterus of control sows. tex <dig> exons 17- <dig> were slightly expressed also in all female tissues, but no expression of exons 31- <dig> was detected in the agarose gel . the tex <dig> expression was also quantified with qpcr, which indicated a markedly lower expression in the female reproductive organs compared to the testis . in addition, no other symptoms have been detected in sa boars and no problems in reproductive performance in sows have been reported indicating that the sa defect affects only male fertility. the sa phenotype and low tex <dig> expression in the ovary, oviduct and uterus indicate a minor role for tex <dig> in these tissues and therefore the premature translation stop codon may not have a major effect on female fertility. these data highlight the role of tex <dig> and the formation of intercellular bridges specifically in spermatogenesis.

marker and gene assisted selection available for selection against the spermatogenic arrest defect
gene assisted selection based on the causal mutation of the sa defect provides a 100% accurate dna test against the defect. pcr amplification with sequence specific primers flanking the  <dig> bp insertion in the genomic sequence of tex <dig> gene can be used for gene assisted selection against the sa defect in the yorkshire population. the size difference of the pcr fragment can be detected on agarose gel  and the disease status defined as sa affected, carrier or control. the fragment size for the allele without the insertion is  <dig> bp  and including the insertion is  <dig> bp .

in order to avoid additional gene test we also evaluated the usability of associated snps for marker assisted selection. heterozygous boars  for snps alga <dig> and asga <dig> from illumina beadchip genotyping were selected for sequencing with primers flanking the tex <dig> insertion. five boars were heterozygous for both snps and appeared to be sa carriers based on the tex <dig> insertion. these boars were also carriers of the haplotype  <dig> . none of the boars  heterozygous only for one snp were sa carriers. sa associated alleles were c and a for snps alga <dig> and asga <dig>  respectively. thus, the haplotype of these markers appears to be a reliable indicator for the presence of the sa insertion at least in the finnish yorkshire population.

discussion
the sa affected boars show almost no late meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells and reduced amount of spermatogonia. this phenotype is very similar to tex <dig> knockout mice phenotype and therefore the search for causal mutation was focused on tex <dig> gene. in tex <dig> knockout mice, initially markedly reduced numbers of late meiotic and post meiotic cells are detected and in older animals more severe phenotype with decrease in all germ cell numbers is present  <cit> . in addition, the vacuolization is increased in older animals in the mouse and was evident also in the pig. in mice, as spermatogonia divide and differentiate, tex <dig> together with other midbody proteins form intercellular bridges, a stable structure formed by mitotic and meiotic divisions and maintained until formation of spermatozoa. tex <dig> interaction with cep <dig> has been shown to be critical for subverting abscission toward a stable intercellular bridge  <cit> .

in tex <dig> knockout male mice, germ cells continue to form midbodies during telophase of cytokinesis, but the midbody is transient, as in somatic cells, and no intercellular bridges are formed  <cit> . thus, tex <dig> knockout mice completely lack intercellular bridges, and spermatogenesis fails before the first meiotic division resulting in male infertility  <cit> . in finnish yorkshire boars the spermatogenic arrest at first meiotic division appears also to be caused by a mutation in the tex <dig> gene. although several polymorphisms were detected within the tex <dig> coding frame, a  <dig> bp insertion in exon  <dig> appears to be the obvious cause for the defect. this insertion results in differential splicing of exon  <dig>  which creates a premature translation stop codon after position  <dig> nt in the sa affected tex <dig> transcript. the expression of all examined tex <dig> fragments were markedly down regulated in the sa affected boar and the protein product of  <dig> kda was absent. the probable cause for the down regulation of the tex <dig> mrna is the nonsense mediated degradation of the incorrectly spliced mrna, but we have not entirely excluded the possibility of down regulation of mrna transcription or changes in cytoplasmic mrna stability. the sequencing of the promoter region  did not show any sa associated mutations indicating that the transcription is not affected by mutations in the promoter region, but regulatory regions further upstream have not been investigated. however, the protein product of tex <dig> appears to be absent in the sa affected testis highlighting the role of this gene in development of the sa defect.

in the finnish yorkshire pigs no effect on female reproduction has been reported and no other symptoms except infertility in boars were detected. thus, the insertion within tex <dig> appears to only affect spermatogenesis. this has also been seen in mice. in tex <dig> knockout females no significant difference in the number of germ cells at prenatal day  <dig>  was detected and litter size was only slightly affected, although the intercellular bridges were missing  <cit> . in this study we have also analyzed the expression of tex <dig> in the testis, ovary, oviduct and uterus of control pigs. tex <dig> appears to be highly expressed in the testis and substantially lower expression or no expression was detected in the female reproductive organs indicating a more prominent role of tex <dig> in the testis. this result is consistent with studies in the mouse showing that tex <dig> is not essential for postnatal oocyte growth and ovarian folliculogenesis  <cit> .

the ancestral sa insertion sequence locates in the pig genome within tex <dig> intron  <dig>  <dig> bp downstream from the sa insertion site. all affected boars also have the original sequence in intron  <dig>  thus the disease causing fragment appears to be copied in the same orientation to exon  <dig>  the sa insertion region was not identified as an interspersed repeat or a low complexity dna sequence, thus it appears to be a unique duplication event in the porcine genome. in the human, indels cause multiple genetic diseases  <cit>  and are a source of natural intra- and interspecific genetic variation  <cit> . short unique sequences are being actively duplicated in mammalian genomes and are often separated by some distance  <cit> . it has been postulated that distantly located duplicates are generated by direct tandem duplications, and separated apart by later insertions  <cit> . however, the sa insertion into an existing target sequence was created with minimal collateral damage to the target. this separated tandem duplication may have arisen by recombination after duplication event, since duplications undergo high frequencies of recombination and are consequently unstable  <cit> . duplications have been shown to attribute from replication slippage errors  <cit> , but also the significance of recombination to the formation of small indels, in particular insertions, has been demonstrated  <cit> . however, these mechanisms require an existing duplicate in the dna sequence  <cit> . in the pig, within the region containing the sa insertion sequence and original sequence within tex <dig> intron  <dig> no duplication sequences were present in the wild type animals. one possible mechanism for the sa duplication event could also be the imperfect repair of dna double-strand breaks by classical nonhomologous end joining   <cit> . nhej requires only short microhomologies of 1- <dig> bp and can even ligate overhangs without homologies  <cit> .

the identification of the insertion within tex <dig> exon  <dig> enables the gene assisted selection against the defect. although the sa carrier status is fairly easy to determine on an agarose gel, we further examined the possibility to use snps on illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip for identification of the sa carriers and affected animals. two snps  were strongly associated with the sa defect and a haplotype of these snps appears to be a usable marker for marker assisted selection against the defect at least within the finnish yorkshire population.

tex <dig> gene appears to be crucial for succesful spermatogenesis in the mouse and pig. the functional studies revealing the role of tex <dig> in the intercellular bridges between developing male germ cells indicate the importance of this gene in sperm production across species. a statistically significant difference in tex <dig> gene expression has also been identified in azoospermic men  <cit> . however, no statistically significant associations between tex <dig> snps and azoospermia have been identified in this study or in other genome wide association analyses of azoospermic men  <cit> . the lack of statistically significant associations may be partly due to the heterogenity of azoospermic cases and low frequency of tex <dig> mutations. genome wide association analyses of heterogenic samples require high number of cases and controls. thus, the low amount of samples hinders the analyses in these studies and larger genome-wide association studies are required in order to identify novel snps associated with azoospermia. however, tex <dig> is a good candidate gene for causal mutations in azoospermic men.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report a specific infertility defect in yorkshire pigs. the infertility is caused by spermatogenic arrest in early meiotic sperm cells resulting in absence of spermatocytes and spermatids. the genome wide scan located the disease associated area within  <dig> mbp region in porcine chromosome  <dig>  sequencing of a candidate gene, tex <dig>  revealed several polymorphisms within the coding sequence. the most likely causal mutation was identified within exon  <dig> resulting in premature stop codon in the mrna sequence. in addition, the expression of tex <dig> mrna and protein products was markedly down regulated in the testis of a sa affected boar compared to control animals. the genomic mutation appeared to be a  <dig> bp insertion, which originates from tex <dig> intron  <dig>  thus, the sa insertion is probably an original duplication event separated by recombination.
