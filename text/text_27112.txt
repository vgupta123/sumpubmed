BACKGROUND
equine piroplasmosis of horses, mules, donkeys and zebras is caused by the tick-borne apicomplexan protozoan parasites babesia caballi and theileria equi, transmitted by ixodid ticks such as dermacentor nitens  and rhipicephalus microplus 
 <cit> . although endemic in most countries
 <cit> , the u. s., until recently, has been considered free of infection. equine infections in florida with b. caballi and t. equi were diagnosed between  <dig> and  <dig> leading to an eradication campaign which lasted twenty-five years and cost twelve million dollars
 <cit> . the re-emergence of t. equi in florida
 <cit>  and texas
 <cit>  raised concern of its further spread within the u. s., and indeed, infected horses have been identified in  <dig> states
 <cit> . the cause of the  <dig> florida outbreak was due to iatrogenic transmission, but two tick species, amblyomma cajennense and d. variabilis, were identified as novel vectors in the  <dig> texas outbreak
 <cit> . the re-emergence of this pathogen in the u.s. impacts global movement and health of horses and affects the multi-billion dollar equine industry.

additional members of the phylum apicomplexa, important to global human and animal health include the organisms in the genus plasmodium as well as t. parva and t. annulata, and babesia bovis causes of malaria, bovine theileriosis and babesiosis, respectively. the phylogenetic position of t. equi has been controversial, and the organism has been renamed several times
 <cit> . molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate an intermediate position for t. equi between b. bovis and theileria spp.
 <cit>  and is supported by the genomic data presented here which provides the deepest phylogenetic analysis to date. collective data supports the concept that a new genus placement sister to theileria may be appropriate for t. equi.

similar to bovine theileriosis caused by t. annulata, transmission of t. equi to equids eventually results in lysis of erythrocytes and prolonged anemia. anemia associated with t. parva occurs later during infection and is comparatively and clinically mild
 <cit> . infection of b- and t-lymphocytes by t. parva and mononuclear phagocytes and b-lymphocytes by t. annulata lead to reversible cell transformation
 <cit> . infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  by t. equi has been reported
 <cit> . however the role of pbmc infection in the pathogenesis of t. equi, unlike t. parva and t. annulata remains unresolved, and pbmc proliferation and/or transformation have not been associated with clinical equine piroplasmosis.

the primary clinical outcome of acute t. equi infection is anemia and the associated erythrolysis is independent of parasite-specific immune responses
 <cit> . resolution of acute disease is followed by apparent life-long parasite persistence within equids
 <cit> . persistence is characterized by the continuous presence of  <dig> to  <dig> infected peripheral erythrocytes per ml/blood resulting in efficient acquisition and transmission by ticks
 <cit> . a hallmark of pathogens that establish persistent infection and avoid immune elimination is the presence of an immunodominant, variable multigene family responsible for immune evasion, such as vesa <dig>  in b. bovis <cit> , pfemp <dig>  in p. falciparum <cit>  and vsg in t. brucei <cit> . an analogous family was not detected in t. equi. a candidate multigene gene family in t. equi encodes equi merozoite antigens , which are immunodominant for antibody, however, this family contains just  <dig> members, and lacks an apparent structural basis for variation. the reemergence and persistence of t. equi in the u. s. prompted this genomic research due to the lack of a vaccine to block infection or clinical disease and the need for additional chemotherapeutics aimed at eliminating persistent infection and tick-borne transmission risk.

RESULTS
chromosome arrangement and content
the genomic complement of t. equi contains six molecules, including four chromosomes  of ~ <dig>  mbp, an apicoplast genome of  <dig>  kbp and a mitochondrial genome of  <dig> kbp. chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  were completely assembled, while chromosome  <dig>  contains one assembly gap. chromosome  <dig>  is fragmented into six pieces with four physical gaps and one assembly gap. the chromosome assemblies agree with the sizes of the chromosomes seen on pulsed field gel electrophoresis, suggesting that there are no large gaps in the genome sequence.

the larger genome size of t. equi as compared to other piroplasms   is also reflected in the number of predicted protein coding genes , ~ 25% greater than found for t. parva, t. annulata and b. bovis. while t. equi contains homologs of genes found only in the two theileria spp. , or b. bovis , it has far more unique genes , which account for the increased size of the genome. the four species have  <dig>  genes in common. t. equi has two rrna operons, and  <dig> trna genes.

e not reported.

the apicoplast
the apicoplast is a plastid-like organelle thought to be derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event with green algae
 <cit> . like plastids, many of the genes for metabolic processes in the apicoplast have migrated to the nuclear genome leaving a remnant genome
 <cit> . in t. equi, the a+t rich   <dig>  kb apicoplast genome is larger than those of other piroplasms, due primarily to expansion of the repertoires of three hypothetical genes . there are  <dig> unidirectionally encoded cdss in the t. equi molecule, which includes  <dig> ribosomal protein coding sequences. additionally, each of the  <dig> trna and two rrna genes are present.

t. equi contains  <dig> nuclear-encoded proteins potentially targeted to the apicoplast as predicted by plasmoap
 <cit> , apicoap
 <cit>  and/or by homology to genes for pathways predicted to occur in the apicoplast . similar to other apicomplexans, t. equi has a complete set of nuclear-encoded enzymes for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway and these activities are predicted to occur in the apicoplast.

mitochondrial genome
the mitochondrial  genome is  <dig> bp in length, longer than in other piroplasms and shows evidence of gene duplication and rearrangement. the t. equi mt sequence was recently reported and the authors suggest that a duplicated cds  is actually cytochrome c oxidase subunit iii 
 <cit> . although there is no sequence similarity to known cox <dig> sequences, t. equi could not conduct respiration without cox <dig>  and these genes are the only candidate for this function. our findings corroborate the linear structure of the mt genome and the long inverted terminal repeat structure
 <cit> .

metabolism
energy production
the predicted metabolic profile of t. equi is similar to other piroplasms: most elements of the core pathways for energy production are present including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid  cycle. glycolysis is fully intact with putative enzymes identified for each stage of the conversion of sugars to pyruvate for the production of energy, making carbon the primary energy source. however, since pyruvate dehydrogenase  is missing from the t. equi genome , glycolysis does not seem to be coupled to the tca cycle. although the tca cycle is intact, the lack of pyruvate dehydrogenase suggests that the primary function may be to generate precursors rather than produce energy. for example, succinyl coa is a critical biosynthetic precursor for the synthesis of protoheme, used in cytochromes and many enzymes. electron transport pathways in t. equi resemble those reported for p. falciparum <cit> . lack of the full complement of nadh dehydrogenase subunits and atp synthase peptides makes it questionable as to whether the electron transport pathway is efficient for the generation of atp from the products of glycolysis.

small molecule synthesis
metabolic pathway similarities with other sequenced hemoparasites include the ability to synthesize pyrimidines, limited amino acid biosynthesis, and the lack of a urea cycle. de novo purine biosynthesis is absent, however, unlike other piroplasms, hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyl transferase  and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase  are present, indicating that purine salvage can occur, similar to p. falciparum. fatty acid synthesis, heme biosynthesis and the shikimic acid pathway do not occur in the piroplasms, although these pathways are present in p. falciparum <cit> .

t. equi encodes dihydrofolate synthase  and a bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase  and is predicted to carry out a limited folate biosynthetic pathway similar to theileria spp
 <cit> . notably, a large number of folate-biopterin transporters were predicted, suggesting that t. equi imports folate which is then modified into other compounds, chiefly nucleotide precursors. folate biosynthesis predicts sensitivity to the drug pyrimethamine cycloguaryl, which has been observed in previous studies
 <cit> , even though t. equi dhfr-ts encodes the s125f mutation that reportedly confers pyrimethamine resistance in b. bovis and certain plasmodium sp dhfr-ts
 <cit> .

phospholipid metabolism
phospholipid metabolism in apicomplexans is well-documented, and highlighted by studies in b. bovis showing a markedly greater phospholipid composition in infected erythrocytes compared to uninfected erythrocytes
 <cit> . t. equi has an increased number of choline/ethanolamine kinase genes, even relative to b. bovis, which has a demonstrated increase in phosphatidylcholine relative to uninfected bovine erythrocytes
 <cit> . although only a partial set of enzymes for synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchors were detected, t. equi has been demonstrated to incorporate gpi anchors on membrane proteins
 <cit> . approximately 2% of the proteome  were predicted to contain both required signatures for gpi anchors; however, this prediction should be used with caution as metabolic labeling studies indicate that there are relatively few gpi anchored protein species within infected erythrocytes, with members of the ema family being the predominantly labeled proteins
 <cit> .

transporter families
transportdb predicts t. equi to have the most transporters of any hemoparasite genome sequenced to date
 <cit> , with  <dig> in total . the most profound increase is within the atp-binding cassette  superfamily of transporters, with t. equi having  <dig> members of this family, compared to just  <dig> in t. parva, and  <dig> in b. bovis. comparatively, plasmodium falciparum has  <dig> members of the abc family, most notably abcb <dig> , a known mediator of chloroquine and mefloquine resistance
 <cit> . resistance to chemotherapeutics also occurs in t. equi, however specific mechanisms of resistance are unknown. given the high number of abc transporter family members in t. equi, including those of the mdr <dig> type and orthologues of the other known drug transport members abcc <dig> and abcg <dig>  it is reasonable to hypothesize that abc-mediated transport contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in t. equi. another expanded family is the type ii general secretory pathway, which contains  <dig> transporters, ~three times the number in the other hemoparasite genomes . this pathway moves signal peptide containing proteins across the cell membrane. the abundance of signal peptide-containing proteins without predicted transmembrane domains suggests that t. equi has a large secretome that utilizes this pathway.

as noted earlier, the folate/biopterin family of transporters is increased , and thus, t. equi may import additional folate to contribute to the one carbon pool. finally, t. equi has  <dig> transporter genes in the major facilitator superfamily  about twice as many as other hemoparasites. the mfs transporters include drug efflux systems, organophosphate:phosphate exchangers and oligosaccharide:h+ symport permeases and are single-polypeptide secondary carriers capable only of transporting small solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients
 <cit> .

chromosomal synteny
figure
 <dig> shows blocks of synteny shared between t. equi and b. bovis, t. parva, or t. annulata. there are relatively few large regions that do not have syntenic matches in the other piroplasm genomes. analysis of chromosome  <dig> demonstrated that these regions contain unique proteins , without pfam hits or other functional assignment. the t. parva and t. annulata chromosomes are highly syntenic, and a much more fragmented pattern of synteny is seen between theileria spp. and b. bovis <cit> . large regions of synteny are observed between the theileria spp. and t. equi, suggesting more recent shared ancestry than for t. equi and b. bovis, where the blocks of synteny are more fragmented. t. equi chromosome  <dig> appears to be evolutionarily related to thelieria spp. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the ancestral theileria chromosome  <dig> has split to provide elements of t. equi chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  approximately 2/ <dig> of each of t. equi chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> share synteny with theileria spp. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the remaining 1/ <dig> of each of these chromosomes contains more of the b. bovis specific lineage sequences or unique sequences. with a few exceptions, t. equi chromosome  <dig> and is syntenic to both t. parva and t. annulata chromosome  <dig>  notably, the orthologous gene matches extend to the ends of each of the t. equi chromosomes demonstrating the lack of telomerically located species-specific gene families and repeats seen in other hemoparasites
 <cit> .

paralogous families
tribemcl placed  <dig> proteins in  <dig> families ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> members . many of the families, including the two largest, have little significant sequence identity, for any two proteins, in pairwise comparisons; however, this result did not change when we used more stringent parameters for clustering. therefore, we analyzed the families for common functional annotation and show that most members of a given family share a common functional domain or feature . exceptions are family  <dig> and family  <dig>  a few families have high levels of sequence conservation and readily identifiable functional attributes found through pfam hits. for example, family  <dig> contains  <dig> members with hits to pfam pf <dig>  a family of abc transporters. a survey of t. equi protein families that have at least  <dig> members revealed that most of these families are comprised of functional attributes similar to those represented in similar scans of b. bovis and theileria spp. none of the t. equi families appear to contain a family of known immunodominant antigenically variable genes, nor are any of the families telomerically associated. notable families are presented below.

family 3
containing  <dig> members, this family has ~30% sequence conservation with a repeat gene family in t. annulata . the tar genes were reported to be analogous to the tpr genes of t. parva, however family  <dig> does not share significant sequence identity with tpr
 <cit> . most members of family  <dig> encode a protein of ~ <dig> kda, with no signal peptide. although the function of these proteins in theileria is unknown, it is thought that these genes in t. parva are involved in the generation of diversity
 <cit> , with the tpr repertoires appearing to be isolate specific
 <cit> . like t. annulata, the t. equi family  <dig> genes are distributed throughout all four chromosomes. expressed sequence tags  were found for only seven of the family  <dig> genes suggesting that only a small number of these genes are expressed at a given time.

equi merozoite antigen  family
family  <dig> contains  <dig> members related to the best characterized protein in t. equi, equi merozoite antigen  <dig> . ema <dig>  a  <dig> kda immunodominant protein, is used as the basis of a celisa diagnostic test for t. equi, as this highly conserved antigen is recognized by sera from infected animals worldwide
 <cit> . ema <dig> has a gpi anchor, a putative erythrocyte-binding domain shared with certain hemotoxins, and surface-exposed epitopes
 <cit> . immunoprecipitation of t. equi proteins by serum from a horse challenged twice at a 2-month interval with t. equi revealed that in addition to ema <dig>  ema <dig> has a gpi anchor and detectable antibody responses were limited to ema1- <dig> proteins
 <cit> . although ema <dig> was originally described as a single copy gene, genomic analysis has revealed a total of  <dig> genes in this family. the amino acid identity ranged from  <dig> to 55% in pairwise comparisons of family members. ema <dig> was previously characterized as 50% identical to ema <dig>  and is also an immunodominant gpi-anchored protein. ema <dig> is more highly expressed in blood stages of the parasite relative to ema <dig> while ema <dig> is more highly expressed in the tick salivary gland during transmission feeding than ema1
 <cit> . these two proteins, along with a third member of this family  have been shown to interact with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton
 <cit> . a single ortholog of these proteins have been identified in t. annulata  and t. parva  but not in other apicomplexa
 <cit> . at least one est was found for each ema family member, with the exception of bewa_ <dig> and bewa_ <dig>  demonstrating that transcription in blood stage parasites takes place for most family members.

a core set of  <dig> ema genes are predicted to encode proteins of ~ <dig> kda, with the remaining two encoding markedly differently sized proteins, one being truncated  and the other  being much longer and only having similarity in the c-terminal domain . interestingly, the truncated gene produces a transcript, based on est analysis, as long as the other family members, but which encodes multiple stops in the 5’ region preventing formation of a full length protein. perhaps this family member is in the process of becoming a pseudogene by disruption of the full reading frame, and an indication that the family may be reduced in size over time.

the ema genes are distributed across the genome, with no evidence of clustering or telomeric association. there is no evidence that the ema genes undergo recombination or dynamic sequence variation, as might be expected if these genes are involved in immune evasion
 <cit> . therefore, despite their immunodominance, their limited number and lack of a structural basis for variation do not fit with the paradigms seen for p. falciparum var genes  or b. bovis ves <dig> genes  where evasion of the immune response through emergence of variable surface antigens is a well characterized mechanism of parasite persistence
 <cit> .

faint domains
while not a protein family per se, the faint domain was originally detected in t. annulata and t. parva as a stretch of  <dig> amino acids and was named “frequently associated in theileria”; subsequently, pfam <dig>  the faint domain – a domain of unknown function  was established and was found to be over represented in proteins predicted to be secreted
 <cit> . t. equi proteins may have multiple faint domains and are typically classified into several protein families. t. equi contains  <dig> proteins with  <dig> hits to pfam <dig>  faint domains are not reported for b. bovis or p. falciparum. the faint domain containing genes are distributed throughout the t. equi genome.

t. equi does not contain homologs of putative theileria host cell transforming genes
although host cell transformation has not been reported for t. equi, it has been reported to invade the lymphocyte and develop to a macroshizont stage
 <cit> . in t. parva and t. annulata, the macroschizont life cycle can induce transformation of the infected cell
 <cit> . to assure that the t. equi isolate used in this study infected equine lymphocytes/pbmcs, equine pbmcs were infected with sporozoites obtained from infected adult male rhipicephalus microplus ticks. to verify infection of equine pbmc cultures, ema- <dig> and ema- <dig> monoclonal antibodies were tested by immunofluorescence and bound corresponding t. equi antigens within equine pbmcs . the lack of observed transformation in this close relative of pathogens  that do transform their host led us to search the t. equi genome for putative host cell transformation genes to see if these genes were retained in the genome. a set of genes
 <cit>  identified as potential manipulators of host cell phenotype in t. annulata and t. parva was used to explore the t. equi genome for orthologous genes, along with the est expression data. t. parva and t. annulata express prohibitin in macro- and microschizonts, while t. equi expresses the ortholog  in erythrocyte-stage parasite ests. prohibitin is reported to be a tumor suppressor that is involved in pathways that lead to immortalization, however, this gene was also identified in b. bovis, which does not undergo transformation
 <cit> . similarly, t. equi has several homologs of cyclophilins, which have been linked to transformation. this gene is found in b. bovis, t. parva and t. annulata, again, limiting the implication of this gene product as a host cell transforming factor. t. equi does not have a homolog of the theileria schizont at hook  family of proteins. the at hooks function as nuclear localization signals and dna binding domains, and may function in cell transformation. likewise, tashhn  and suat <dig> do not have t. equi orthologs. tashhn is expressed by theileria macroschizonts that have lost the ability to form merozoites, while suat <dig> is a schizont protein with characteristics of the tashat family, that can modulate the phenotype of cultured bovine macrophages by altering the expression profile of cytoskeletal proteins in a manner similar to that seen during infection. 

vaccine candidates
the rap- <dig> family
members of the rhoptry associated protein- <dig>  gene family are candidates for vaccine development in babesia spp. immunization of cattle with purified native rap- <dig> of b. bigemina resulted in partially protective responses, and is one of three antigens in a recombinant vaccine developed in australia
 <cit> . however, recombinant b. bovis rap- <dig> failed to elicit protective immune responses in vaccine trials. the rap- <dig> proteins of babesia spp. are characterized by a signal peptide followed by a cysteine-rich region and several short conserved sequence motifs within the first  <dig> amino acids. thus, the n-terminal region of all known babesia rap- <dig> proteins contains the “rap- <dig> domain”. the c-terminal regions are less conserved among babesia species. b. bovis contains two identical rap <dig> genes in tandem and a shorter rap <dig> related protein gene  located ~ <dig> kbp from the rap <dig> locus. three rap <dig> genes were identified in t. parva and four in t. annulata. the general structure of rap <dig> in theileria spp. is different from that in b. bovis, with the theileria proteins containing more than one rap- <dig> domain. the t. equi rap <dig> locus contains two tandemly arranged genes: bewa_ <dig> contains two rap- <dig> domains, and bewa_ <dig> contains three rap- <dig> domains. thus, the arrangement of rap- <dig> domains in t. equi resembles that found in other theileria spp.

apical membrane antigen 1
t. equi apical membrane antigen- <dig>  is a microneme protein with surface exposed epitopes that has orthologs in hemoprotozoan apicomplexa, as well as toxoplasma gondii <cit> . ama- <dig> antibody has inhibitory effects on parasite replication in vitro, and has been protective in animal models
 <cit> . t. equi and b. bovis ama- <dig> lacks the n-terminal extension found in other theileria spp. ama- <dig> has a set of conserved cysteine residues which may contribute to a conserved architecture through disulfide bonds. plasmodium ama- <dig> is polymorphic
 <cit> , and the degree of polymorphism must be assessed in t. equi before ama- <dig> can be considered as a vaccine candidate for this species.

thrombospondin-related anonymous protein 
conserved hypothetical proteins bewa_ <dig> and bewa_ <dig> fall into a cluster of orthologous groups  with apicomplexan genes annotated as trap, sporozoite surface protein or microneme protein 2
 <cit> . although these molecules have been effective immunogens in plasmodium <cit> , the t. equi proteins have low sequence similarity and it is unclear whether these would be effective vaccine candidates.

other prophylaxis opportunities suggested by comparative genomics
hap <dig> is a protein essential for membrane fusion during zygote formation in plasmodium that has a homolog in numerous species, including leishmania and t. parva <cit> . a positional homolog i.e., a gene with very low sequence identity couched within a highly conserved locus, exists in b. bovis  and t. equi . this target could provide a novel method of transmission blocking through gene knock out, thus preventing gamete fusion and tick transmission of a modified live vaccine. membrane occupation and recognition nexus protein  seems to be related to cell division in all apicomplexa studied, and functions in both asexual and sexual reproduction
 <cit> . a common and effective prophylaxis for members of the phylum could come from targeting this molecule. bewa_ <dig> is annotated as a morn repeat domain-containing protein, and falls in to a cog with proteins from plasmodium, theileria, and b. bovis, as well as toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. heme detoxification protein  has a role in detoxifying heme that results from parasite metabolism of hemoglobin by polymerizing the heme into hemozoin
 <cit> . bewa_ <dig>  a putative hdp, is in a cog conserved across apicomplexan organisms. this hypothetical target for prophylaxis would allow toxic levels of heme to accumulate through inactivation of hdp.

p <dig> locus synteny
t. parva p <dig> is an abundant sporozoite surface antigen, and along with its homolog from t. annulata  has been shown to induce neutralizing antibody, and immunity to theileriosis and has been a target of vaccine development
 <cit> . a positional homolog was identified in b. bovis 
 <cit>  and t. equi contains a gene at the same location . est data show that bewa_ <dig> is transcribed. the prospect that the genes occupying this position in syntenic loci have similar functions during parasite infection but tailored to different hosts makes them interesting candidates for vaccine studies.

the t. parva six
a set of six t. parva antigens that are the targets of cd8+ t lymphocyte responses in immune cattle have been designated tp <dig> tp <dig>  tp <dig> tp <dig>  tp <dig> and tp8
 <cit> . tp <dig> is a surface protein whose homolog is also expressed in t. annulata. all of these vaccine candidates except hypothetical protein tp <dig> have orthologs in t. equi and have been demonstrated to be transcribed in erythrocyte stages via est analyses. while the significance of piroplasm stage expression is unclear, these t. equi proteins may have utility as vaccine components based on observations in t. parva.

phylogenetic analysis of piroplasms
mehlhorn and schein renamed babesia equi as t. equi in  <dig> due to the description of a lymphocytic stage for this parasite
 <cit> ; however, while this classification has been well adopted, it is not borne out by phylogenetic studies. the phylogenetic position of t. equi was explored using  <dig> deduced amino acid sequences  from eight fully sequenced apicomplexan genomes. results of the bayesian analysis  support two possible scenarios: the four piroplasm species, t. parva, t. annulata, b. bovis and t. equi, represent a single genus or alternatively, these species represent three separate genera. maximum parsimony  analyses of individual sequences resulted in many different tree topologies; however, the four most commonly recovered topologies  represent 78% of all trees. consistent with bayesian inference, the three most common topologies  suggest that t. equi shares a more recent common ancestor with the two theileria species than with b. bovis. mp analysis of the concatenated datasets unambiguously recovered this same relationship of the four piroplasm species, and completely corroborated the tree estimated using bayesian inference. finally, maximum likelihood analyses of the concatenated datasets using a variety of substitution models  consistently yielded the same estimates, which completely corroborate the trees generated by bayesian inference and mp analyses of the concatenated datasets . collectively, robust phylogeny estimation, which utilized three separate optimality criteria and various models of protein evolution, consistently placed t. equi as a sister taxon to the theileria clade, with all three of these piroplasm species subtended by b. bovis. 

previous studies employing 18s rrna sequences across many piroplasmid taxa also revealed uncertainty in the phylogenetic position of t. equi and several other piroplasms
 <cit> . our robust phylogenetic analyses, which strongly imply the placement of t. equi as sister to the theileria clade provide stability to piroplasm systematics. our goal was to determine if a selection of orthologous polypeptides from completed babesia and theileria genomes could be used to discriminate the appropriate phylogenetic position of t. equi. however, species sampling was restricted by available complete genome sequences and is too limited to completely resolve this issue. a more appropriate solution may be to place t. equi in a genus distinct from both theileria and babesia, as has been previously suggested
 <cit> . this option would likely result in the renaming of some related taxa including cytauxzoon felis, which groups as the closest relative of t. equi in the 18s rrna study
 <cit> . importantly, our analysis revealed a set of  <dig> informative genes that could be analyzed in a broader sampling of piroplasmida taxa to gain a greater understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the piroplasms .

CONCLUSIONS
characteristics of genes involved in immune evasion leading to persistence include immunodominance, highly variable domains, and membership in a multigene family. within the phylum apicomplexa, b. bovis contains the  <dig> member ves <dig> gene family which encodes the vesa <dig>  known to vary by gene conversion and participate in immune evasion; and p. falciparum contains the  <dig> member var gene family encoding pfemp <dig>  which utilizes several mechanisms to generate antigenic variation resulting in immune evasion
 <cit> . an analogous gene family wasn’t detected in t. equi, instead, it contains a small family of immunodominant proteins including ema <dig>  ema <dig>  ema <dig> and seven additional members which have marked variation throughout each gene. while the precise mechanism of antigenic variation provided by the ema family isn’t yet known, we hypothesize that ema family members provide antigenic variation and immune escape through a protein reassortment strategy that generates immune escape variants by creating novel heteromers of ema on the cell surface. the genome sequence also revealed a  <dig> member gene family ; however these proteins have never been detected by immune serum, suggesting that they are not contributing to immune evasion. genome sequencing allowed an exploration of the phylogenetic position of t. equi at a depth not previously feasible; demonstrating that this species clusters consistently with, and as a sister lineage to other theileria spp. genome sequences for closely related piroplasms may allow “fine tuning” of the t. equi phylogenetic position and appropriate naming of the lineage to which this species belongs. finally, the genome sequence will provide an invaluable tool for researchers developing methods to control equine piroplasmosis.

parasite culture
for sequencing
theileria equi usda  stabilate  generated from infection of a spleen intact horse  was inoculated intravenously into a splenectomized horse . when the parasitemia reached 16% as determined by giemsa stained blood smear examination, blood was collected into a flask containing glass beads for defibrination. the blood was washed three times with hbss/10mm edta to remove the white blood cells . erythrocytes were purified using histopaque  <dig> following the manufacturer’s protocol. microscopic examination determined wbc contamination to be ≪ <dig> wbc per  <dig> ul of blood. t. equi genomic dna was extracted from the purified erythrocytes using components of the gentra puregene dna purification system .

t. equi sporozoite infection of pbmc in vitro:
to obtain the sporozoites need for in vitro pbmc infection, one thousand adult male rhipicephalus microplus ticks were acquisition fed on a t. equi  merozoite stabilate-infected adult horse during ascending parasitemia for eight days . following acquisition feeding, fed ticks were incubated for two days at 15°c with 94% relative humidity and a  <dig> hr photo period, and subsequently transmission fed on a naïve horse to induce final maturation of sporozoites into their infectious stage. on day seven of the transmission feeding,  <dig> live adult males were recovered and salivary gland pairs were dissected aseptically, and sporozoite extracts prepared using established methods. briefly, collected salivary glands were washed in  <dig>  ml of complete media  and crushed in a glass homogenizer to release sporozoites. the homogenate was then centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> min and the supernatant containing sporozoites was collected and adjusted to  <dig> tick equivalents/ml. one ml of the sporozoite extract was inoculated into each of ten wells of a 24-well plate containing  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmc from an uninfected horse. starting on day nine post-inoculation, cell culture aliquots were cytospun and examined microscopically for infection following diff-quick staining.

functional annotation was as for b. bovis <cit> . in addition, ec numbers were assigned in an automated fashion using priam
 <cit>  and metabolic pathways constructed using sri’s pathway tools
 <cit> . transportdb is a relational database that was used to determine transporter complement
 <cit> . tribemcl
 <cit>  was used with default parameters to construct a database of genes that are part of paralogous families of proteins represented in the genome. the method is a sequence similarity matrix-based markov clustering method.

comparative genome analysis
sybil  was used to create an all-versus-all blastp search using the proteomes of t. equi, b. bovis, t. parva, t.annulata, p. falciparum, p. vivax, c. parvum and t. gondii. these outputs were subjected to jaccard clustering, placing proteins into distinct clusters for each proteome. clusters from different proteomes were linked based on best bidirectional blastp hits between them to provide jf-cogs. a minimum block size of five with one gap was allowed in the analyses.

immunofluorescence assay
to verify pbmc cultures were infected with t. equi, cytospin preparations were made for immunofluorescence antibody microscopy on day nine after cell culture inoculation. after drying, cytospin preparations were fixed in 1% formalin for  <dig> min and primarily labeled with t. equi ema- <dig> and ema-2-specific monoclonal antibody 36/ <dig> . bound antibody was detected using fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg <dig> and subsequently visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic position of t. equi relative to other piroplasm species with published genomes, namely t. parva, t. annulata, and b. bovis was determined based on  <dig> polypeptide sequences, and rooted with four other apicomplexan taxa: p. vivax, p. falciparum, t. gondii, and c. parvum. polypeptides were selected from single copy genes identified in all eight species. cogs  were defined using an in-house comparative pipeline, which starts with blastp among protein sequences within and across species. we used the blosum <dig> matrix with expected value 10- <dig>  jaccard clustering was then performed twice, once to form within-species clusters of paralogous genes and a second time to derive a set of multi-species cogs. in the first case, we used an 80% identity cutoff over a minimum of 70% of the length of the smallest protein and a link score of  <dig> . in the second, we set the identity cutoff at 50% over >70% length, and jaccard coefficient cutoff of  <dig> for edge pruning. in order to minimize ambiguous amino acid homology assignments that can occur when indels are present, peptides were chosen that have the smallest protein size variation across all species . protein sequences within a cog were aligned with clustalw using default parameters
 <cit> .

three methods were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the sequences: i) maximum parsimony  with exhaustive tree search, and otherwise default parameters as implemented in paup v <dig> b10
 <cit> , ii) bayesian inference  implemented in mrbayes v <dig> .2
 <cit> , and iii). maximum likelihood  estimation as implemented in raxml v. <dig> .8
 <cit> . initially, the individual protein datasets were analyzed with maximum parsimony, with branch support assessed with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the  <dig> datasets were subsequently concatenated and again analyzed using mp with exhaustive tree search and similar bootstrapping procedure. for bi of the concatenated datasets, the amino acid transition matrix was set to a mixture of models with fixed rate matrices  of equal prior probabilities, and otherwise default parameters. four runs of mrbayes were conducted, each with  <dig> chains. two of those runs ran for  <dig>  generations and the other two ran for  <dig> , <dig> generations. convergence was achieved  for all model parameters estimated, including tree length , the amino acid model , and the tree topology. ml analyses of the concatenated datasets all implemented a gamma model of rate heterogeneity with estimation of the proportion of invariable sites. six separate amino acid substitution models  were utilized. branch support was assessed with  <dig> bootstrap pseudoreplications.

note: two additional genome sequences of interest were published while this article was in review. t. orientalis does not transform it’s host cell and has been compared to t. parva and t. annulata to identify putative mediators of leukocyte transformation
 <cit> . b. microti phylogeny was analyzed using  <dig> single copy genes and found to clade separately to t. parva, t. annulata and b. bovis <cit> .
