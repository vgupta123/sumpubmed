BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that has been widely described in the intestinal tract of humans and animals. in  <dig>  c. difficile was recognized as a major cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and, in the most serious cases pseudomembranous colitis . since then, many outbreaks have been reported; most of them were associated with the emergence of a specific subtype, hyper-virulent pcr-ribotype  <dig>  <cit> . nowadays, c. difficile is a worldwide public health concern as it is considered the major cause of antibiotic-associated infections in healthcare settings  <cit> . a recent report of c. difficile infection  cost-of-illness attributes a mean cost ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  usd for hospitalised patients  in the usa  <cit>  and annual economic burden estimated around  <dig>  million euro in europe  <cit> .

cdi is more commonly diagnosed among older people in nursing homes. high isolation frequencies have been described in usa, with up to 46 % of elderly residents testing positive for c. difficile, while in europe or canada the reported rates are much lower, varying between  <dig>  and 10 %  <cit> . this is partly because elderly people are more commonly in hospitals, have an antibiotic treatment and age-related changes in intestinal flora and host defences, as well as the presence or other underlying health problem . these factors can have an impact on the intestinal microbiota, which may promote c. difficile colonisation and the development of the infection  <cit> . therefore, a new concern of several studies has been the identification of the microbial communities implicated in the cdi through the use of new sequencing techniques, like metagenomics  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to evaluate and follow the prevalence of c. difficile among the residents of a belgian nursing home. multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis  was performed to determine the genetic diversity of the c. difficile isolates and possible cross-infection between patients. additionally, 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to characterise the faecal microbiota of the elderly residents, to evaluate the global evolutions of the total microbiota and to identify possible relationships between certain bacteria populations and c. difficile colonisation, diarrhoea and antibiotic treatment.

characterization of c. difficile isolates
four different pcr-ribotypes  were identified among the  <dig> isolates. in one resident , different pcr-ribotypes were found in different sampling days while in another subject  two different pcr-ribotypes were detected in the same sampling day . only in one resident , all but one samples obtained were positive for c. difficile and the isolated strains were all identified as pcr-ribotype  <dig>  three out of these four different pcr-ribotypes had toxin activity. all toxigenic isolates encoded toxin a and b, while pcr-ribotype  <dig> also contained the binary toxin. in addition, all types  <dig> contained an 18-base pair deletion, a deletion at  <dig> of the tcdc gen and gyra mutation associated with moxifloxacin resistance .

c. difficile mlva analysis
mlva was performed in order to provide further insight into the clonal relatedness of the c. difficile isolates and cross-infection between patients. a total  <dig> isolates were obtained during the study. among them,  <dig> toxigenic and non-toxigenic isolates were further analysed by mlva. selection of these strains was based on the inclusion of a representative number of isolates from each classified pcr ribotype. in order to determine if the seven variable-number-tandem repeat  loci were stable over time or if subjects harboured more than one c. difficile type, isolates obtained from the same resident on direct culture and after  <dig> enrichment days and on different weeks were also studied by mlva. thirty-one different mlva profiles were identified. however, a high degree of genetic relatedness was observed among most of the strains with the same pcr-ribotype . the c <dig> and a <dig> were the most diverse vntr loci. regarding the strains identified as pcr-ribotype  <dig>  most of them were closely related. furthermore, several isolates from patients  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had an identical mlva profile .table  <dig> mlva profile of the isolates obtained from each nursing home resident

analysis of the residents’ faecal microbiota by barcoded pyrosequencing
among the  <dig> residents, all available faecal samples from  <dig> residents  were selected for 16s profiling of their faecal microbiota. a total of  <dig>  final reads were attributed to  <dig>  species level otus  among  <dig> samples . the analysis showed that the major phyla found in patients were firmicutes and bacteroidetes followed by the verrucomicrobia and the proteobacteria . on the family level, the major populations were consistent with previous human studies, bacteroidaceae, ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae being dominant. the verrucomicrobiaceae, porphyromonadaceae and rikenellaceae were subdominant . the  <dig> major genera were bacteroides, akkermansia, parabacteroides, alistipes and two populations undefined at the genus level belonging respectively to the lachnospiraceae and the ruminococcaceae .fig.  <dig> taxonomical distribution deduced by 16s rrna profiling. bart chart detailing the mean cumulated relative abundance of the major phyla and families for each resident



the mean alpha diversity and richness was variable between residents , though no resident mean values are statistically different from the rest of the cohort . moreover, the analysis of the microbiota species structure and composition showed that each patient has his own microbiological imprint during the study as revealed by weighted unifrac analysis of phylogenetic distribution of the samples based on a bray-curtis distance matrix .fig.  <dig> species bacterial diversity and species phylotypic tree based on bray-curtis distance matrix. a bacterial diversity , bacterial richness  and bacterial evenness . bacterial diversity indexes are expressed as a box plot of the mean from subsampled datasets, whiskers represent minimum and maximum value. median is shown as a line inside the box. b phylotype tree of the  <dig> subsampled datasets built upon a bray-curtis distance matrix at the species taxonomical level . the figure also shows all the faecal samples studied by 16s rdna profiling analysis collected from each resident in different weeks



among the  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples were detected positive for c. difficile by 16s rrna gene analysis . reads sharing minimum 99 % of identity to the c. difficile 16s rrna sequence were identified as c. difficile. nearest known species  share less than 99 % of nucleotide identity on the v1-v <dig> hypervariable region with c. difficile 16s rrna sequence. thirty-seven out of  <dig> samples analysed by 16s rrna gene analysis were positive for c. difficile positive by classical microbiology. among the positive samples,  <dig> samples were detected by both methods,  <dig> samples were positive only by culture and  <dig> were positive only by 16s rrna profiling.fig.  <dig>

link between c. difficile colonisation and faecal microbiota
in order to explore the link between c. difficile colonisation and the resident microbiota, residents negative and positive for c. difficile were grouped. as the inter-individual variability is the main driving factor for the sample clustering, the grouping was made by resident instead of strict positive and negative samples. figure  <dig> shows the major mean genus relative abundance for both groups. statistical analysis revealed that only four genus populations have significant relative abundance between both groups . blautia  and flavonifractor  and the lachnospiraceae_unclassified  appeared more abundant in the c. difficile positive group, whereas akkermansia  abundance was higher in the c. difficile negative group. in order to better understand these differences, both groups were further divided into diarrhoeic  or non-diarrhoeic residents. results showed a decrease in verrucomicrobiaceae linked to c. difficile positive groups . in addition, a higher abundance of lachnospiraceae family was detected in c. difficile positive diarrhoeic residents compared to other groups  .fig.  <dig> microbiota comparison between c. difficile negative and positive residents. a mean cumulative relative abundance distribution for the major bacterial genera  for c. difficile negative  and positive residents . b changes in microbial genus populations between c. difficile negative and positive residents. populations whom relative abundance is statistically different are expressed as mean relative abundance ± standard error of the mean . c bacterial diversity , bacterial richness  and bacterial evenness . bacterial diversity indexes are expressed as the mean value with standard deviation, from subsampled datasets. statistical differences are represented by asterisks  after bonferroni corrections



the analysis of mean alpha diversity of both groups showed that c. difficile positive group does not exhibited an increased faecal microbial diversity compared to c. difficile negative group after bonferroni corrections . no differences were revealed in the species richness . the diarrhoeic status does not appear to have an influence on the results obtained .

discussion
the gut microbiota ecosystem plays a critical role in resistance to colonisation by pathogenic organisms, infection and recurrence  <cit> . c. difficile colonisation has been described as ten times higher in elderly nursing home residents than in the general population living outside long-term care facilities  <cit> . the deteriorating health status of nursing home residents, their frequent hospitalisation and the cohabitation in the same contaminated environment promote bacterial colonisation and dissemination  <cit> . the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of c. difficile in a short cohort of elderly nursing home residents and to evaluate the global evolutions of their faecal microbiota.

in the present study,  <dig>  %  were positive to c. difficile. in previous studies conducted in germany, united kingdom, ireland, australia or canada, the prevalence of positive residents reported ranges between  <dig>  and 10 % . this prevalence is much higher in other reports in usa, varying between  <dig>  and  <dig>  %. the same scenario was reported for the incidence of cdi in belgian hospitals when compared with other hospitals in europe and usa  <cit> . in this study, only one resident was diagnosed with a cdi. however, other residents presented symptoms  and either stool test positive for toxigenic c. difficile. therefore, the lack of clinical diagnosis or request do not exclude that other residents suffered cdi during the study period. on the other hand, positive residents to c. difficile without any signs of disease were also detected. results obtained from pcr-ribotyping and mlva showed that there was a clonal dissemination within the nursing home residents. therefore, even if some authors have refuted the theory of person-to person transmission to explain the increase incidence of cdi within hospital awards  <cit> , it seems that in nursing homes the situation is different. only four different pcr-ribotypes were identified and three of them were toxigenic . surprisingly, none of them were among the five pcr-ribotypes most commonly identified in belgian hospitals in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . since  <dig>  decline in the prevalence of the pcr-ribotype  <dig> has been reported in different european countries. furthermore, in belgium, the proportion of hospitals with the hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig> decreases from 34 % in  <dig> to 15 % in  <dig>  <cit> . nursing home population is closed and restricted and changes in the prevalence of pcr-ribotypes come later than in hospitals. therefore, it could be hypothesised that the most prevalent pcr-ribotypes today in hospitals   <cit>  will be in a few years predominant in nursing homes. in previous studies on elderly gut microbiota, bacteroidetes and firmicutes have been reported to dominate, with a marked preponderance of bacteroidetes over firmicutes . in the present study, the major bacterial phyla identified in residents’ microbiota are firmicutes followed by bacteroidetes. we also found a higher abundance of verrucomicrobia than previously observed  <cit> . the predominance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes has also been highlighted in a large cohort study in belgium  <cit> , although the overall prevalence of bacteroidetes in our study is higher than the mean value on a large-scale population level . this increase in bacteroidetes relative proportion in elderly gut microbiota compared to a matched cohort of younger adults has already been described  <cit> .

it has been recently underlined that longitudinal survey of microbiota in elderly and long-stay residents did not support a model of unstable microbiota and diversity  <cit> . the longitudinal analysis of the bacterial diversity of community composition showed that bacterial diversity and richness is variable between residents but did not reveal any evolution during the study. moreover, inter-individual microbiota variability is known to be greater than temporal variability  <cit>  and has been confirmed by community structure analysis.

there are a growing number of publications on the gut microbiota exploration and cdi. some of them focus on the idea that commensal bacterial populations can protect from cdi  <cit> . although no candidate population has emerged, loss of some bacterial genera like bacteroides has been associated with cdi  <cit> . other studies on hospitalized cdi patients described a significant alteration of gut microbiota during cdi along with decreased biodiversity and richness  <cit> . this alteration includes a rise in proteobacteria and a decrease in lachnospiraceae and other butyrate-producing bacteria  <cit> . however, it should be noted that these alterations do not appear to be specific to cdi and are also observed in patients without c. difficile diarrhoea. in a first extensive study on elderly and cdi, rea et al.  <cit>  showed that there was little difference regarding the microbiota composition between cdi subjects and asymptomatic c. difficile carriers. moreover, only minor bacterial taxon showed a statistically different abundance between c. difficile positive subjects and negative individuals.

the 16s rrna profiling has been performed on a limited cohort of c. difficile negative and positive residents. even if it was longitudinal, we did not focus on the pathology or on the antibiotic use that might have occurred during the survey. we centred this analysis on the hypothesis that in these long term stay residents, c. difficile persistent or recurrent colonisation might be associated with more pronounced differences in microbiota between both groups. significant changes have been observed in c. difficile positive individuals in the relative abundance of bacterial populations, but these are limited to the lachnospiraceae and verrucomicrobiaceae. surprisingly, lachnospiraceae and specifically genus blautia abundance is higher in c. difficile positive individuals, which is quite different from previous reports  <cit> . even if cdi diagnosis was not specifically performed during the study, we further split both residents groups regarding the presence of diarrhoeic faeces and observed that this bacterial family abundance is significantly higher in c. difficile positive residents having diarrhoeic faeces compared to diarrhoeic c. difficile negative individuals. verrucomicrobiaceae  is known to be linked to gut health and its abundance seems to be reduced in context of gut inflammation  <cit> . in addition, akkermansia is an appealing candidate to become a human probiotic, selected based on established mechanisms of preventive treatment of obesity and diabetes  <cit> . even if gut inflammatory status of the residents has not been investigated, it is a known risk factor for c. difficile colonisation and could therefore be responsible for this negative correlation.

positive c. difficile status is not associated with microbiota richness or biodiversity reduction in our study . it appears that impact on gut microbiota structure is associated with actual diarrhoeic episodes instead of c. difficile positive status  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that stool consistency is a dominant factor associated with microbiota composition and negatively correlate species richness with stool looseness  <cit> . comparison between diarrhoeic samples versus non-diarrhoeic samples in this study confirms this with a slight yet significant decrease in bacterial richness  but not in biodiversity.

this study underlines that c. difficile status in long-term stay elderly resident is associated with specific changes in microbiota composition. we confirm that the detection alone of this bacterium cannot be linked to major changes in microbiota structure. we have shown that longitudinal study underlines the dynamic of c. difficile status and the relative stability of gut microbiota in these elderly populations. the major limitation of this is the relatively low number of volunteers. microbiota analysis has been marked by a strong inter-individual variability, which can certainly influence comparisons between c. difficile negative and positive groups. it has been recently shown that several types of microbiota composition might increase susceptibility to cdi  <cit> . further studies on long-term stay residents will be needed to improve our knowledge of the c. difficile reservoir and susceptibility in nursing homes.

CONCLUSIONS
c. difficile colonisation is higher in nursing homes than in hospitals, with a predominance of the hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig>  mlva reveals a clonal dissemination of this pcr-ribotype among nursing home residents. in the last years the prevalence of this type is decreasing in hospitals, suggesting that the isolation of elderly in nursing homes has an important impact on the type of strains found. changes were observed in c. difficile positive individuals in the relative abundance of some bacterial populations, including lachnospiraceae and verrucomicrobiaceae. lachnospiraceae and specifically genus blautia abundance is higher in c. difficile positive individuals than in negative individuals. positive c. difficile status is not associated with microbiota richness or biodiversity reduction in this study. notably, a decrease of akkermansia in positive subjects was repeatedly found. the link between akkermansia, gut inflammation and c. difficile colonisation merits further investigations.
