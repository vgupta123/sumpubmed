BACKGROUND
q fever is caused by coxiella burnetii, a small, gram-negative and strict intracellular bacterium. although coxiella was historically considered as a member of the genus rickettsia, gene-sequence analysis classified the coxiella genus in the order legionellales, family coxiellaceae with rickettsiella and aquicella, and c. burnetii as the only known species of this genus  <cit> . q fever is characterized by acute and chronic courses. in humans, acute q fever usually presents a flu-like, self-limiting disease accompanied by myalgia and severe headache, but complications such as pneumonia or hepatitis may occur. in chronic cases, endocarditis is the main severe complication in patients with valvulopathies. granulomatous hepatitis, vasculitis, osteomyelitis, post-q fever fatigue syndrome  and premature delivery or abortion have also been reported  <cit> . in animals, q fever affects livestock and is associated with pneumonia and reproductive disorders in livestock, with abortion, stillbirth, delivery of weak and unviable newborns, placentitis, endometritis and infertility  <cit> . c. burnetii infections have been reported in a variety of wild and domestic mammals, including dogs, cats and birds. the agent has also been isolated from ticks that are vectors for spreading and maintaining c. burnetii in nature  <cit> . the main route of infection is inhalation of contaminated aerosol or dust containing bacteria shed by infected animals with milk, feces, placenta or vaginal secretions  <cit> . oral transmission seems less common, but the consumption of contaminated raw milk and dairy-products represents a potential source of human infection  <cit> .

human q fever seems to be re-emerging in various countries as the number of cases described in the literature is increasing. this increase in clinical awareness could result from renewed interest in coxiella burnetii because of bioterrorism concerns since this highly-infectious bacterium is classified as a category b potential biological weapon. however, epidemiological markers are lacking. as a consequence, the source of human infections often remains unidentified but sheep and goats are more frequently involved in the disease cycle than other animal species. in many cases, the occurrence of human cases can be traced back to an infected flock, where the number of aborting ewes has not alerted the farmer  <cit> .

the systematic genotyping of c. burnetii isolates would enhance our ability to identify the source of infections and consequently help reduce the number of cases in an outbreak. although different virulence levels of infections have been observed, it is still not clear whether this is the result of a variability in bacterial virulence factors or whether it depends on the immunological background of the host. involvement of specific virulence factors, or of particular strains, which can provoke acute or chronic forms, has not yet been demonstrated. initially, the com <dig> sequence and a certain plasmid profile were assumed to be associated with so-called acute or chronic c. burnetii isolates. recent findings, however, revealed no correlation between these criteria  <cit> . development of the acute or chronic form of q fever seems to depend upon the patient's condition and immune status  <cit> .

taking into account the strong similarity or event identity between qph <dig> and qpdg, coxiella strains can be divided into four groups based on the occurrence of the plasmids qph <dig>  qprs, qpdv and one plasmid  derived from a chinese c. burnetii isolate  <cit> . plasmidless c. burnetii strains carry large plasmid-homologous sequences integrated into the chromosome  <cit> . analysis of the genome by techniques such as dna-dna hybridization or restriction fragment length polymorphism is hampered, because cultivation of the agent is wearisome. these bacteria are usually grown on cell cultures or embryonated hen's eggs.

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis has been used for typing of c. burnetii strains  <cit> , but it is sophisticated and laborious and thus not well suited for routine use. therefore, the use of newer  dna methods appears to be more appropriate. infrequent restriction site-pcr  has been shown to be a robust method for the molecular characterization of bacteria such as bartonella, brucella, legionella, listeria and salmonella  <cit> . recently, an mlst  assay was proposed for c. burnetii  <cit> . the assay is based upon the sequencing of  <dig> short intergenic regions. one hundred and seventy-three isolates of various origins could be separated into  <dig> different sequence types.

multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats  analysis  is a typing method, which is gaining importance due to the availability of whole genome sequences, the often very high discriminatory power, and its very low cost, as compared to mlst for instance. mlva typing is now considered to be the reference method for many pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , bacillus anthracis  <cit> , yersinia pestis  <cit>  and is usually applied whenever new genome sequences are released for pathogens of interest  <cit> . in a number of instances, especially in species of recent origin, the discriminatory power of mlva is much higher than mlst  <cit> . freely available resources are accessible over the internet to facilitate the setting-up of new mlva assays  <cit>  or to query existing data  <cit> . the main aim of the present study is to examine the interest of mlva to reveal molecular diversity among isolates of c. burnetii from livestock and man. a recent investigation lead to the development of a first mlva assay for coxiella burnetii, using  <dig> markers and  <dig> isolates  <cit> . we explore here additional markers which could be used in an mlva assay and propose two complementary panel, as recently done for brucella mlva typing  <cit> . we compare mlva to irs-pcr analysis, and to previous mlst and mlva reports using published data.

RESULTS
classification of c. burnetii isolates by irs-pcr
analysis of  <dig> c. burnetii isolates  by four different irs-pcr assays resulted in a total of six patterns . the number of dna fragments generated by irs-pcr depends on the primers used , and varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  the size of the amplicons varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp . irs-pcr assays using psalg and ps <dig> generated the highest number of dna fragments, whereas those using psalc/ps <dig> or psalt/ps <dig> generated the most diverse patterns. irs-pcr analysis was made in duplicates and little to no pattern variability between duplicate reactions was found, only minor variations in the intensity of bands. however, the number of dna fragments was smaller in our study compared to others  <cit> , which illustrates the interlaboratory reproducibility problems inherent with multiple loci pcr amplifications.

mlva set-up
by analyzing available sequence data, thirty-five tandem repeats with a repeat unit longer than  <dig> bp, and at least four units were identified in the microorganism tandem repeats database  <cit> . one failed to yield a pcr product,  <dig> were polymorphic and  <dig> were kept for subsequent analyses . the  <dig> markers and corresponding primers are listed in table  <dig>  the loci are divided in two panels according to repeat unit length. ten tandem repeats with repeat units equal to or longer that  <dig> bp which can be confidently typed on agarose gels constitute panel <dig>  this set contains one of the seven loci previously reported by svraka et al.  <cit> , cox <dig> . seven loci have repeat units of  <dig> or  <dig> bp, six of which were previously reported  <cit> , and the correspondence is indicated in table  <dig>  cox <dig>  is reported as having a  <dig> base-pairs repeat unit. however, it is also seen as a  <dig> bp repeat unit tandem repeat in the tandem repeat database  <cit> , and we observe allele size variations in agreement with this alternative view. four strains are shared by the two investigations . unfortunately, although svraka et al. sequenced all the alleles they observed, the data was not made available  <cit> . in addition, svraka et al. mention that they observed a discrepancy in the size estimate provided by their capillary electrophoresis equipment compared to the sequence data, and preferred to use the first estimate which is equipment-dependant, and this then makes interlaboratory comparisons more complicated.

a collection of  <dig> c. burnetii isolates could be differentiated by mlva typing into  <dig> genotype with panel  <dig> alone  or  <dig> genotypes when using the  <dig> panels . some isolates have an identical genotype with mlva. for example, cbb <dig> and cbb <dig> are two isolates from french cattle with the same geographic origin. the exact source of the isolates is unknown, it could be from the same herd and explain the identical genotype.

genetic relationship of isolates
CONCLUSIONS
some difficulties of the molecular epidemiology of c. burnetii are related to the fastidious growth of this bacterium. mlva analysis does not require the isolation of the isolates. genomic analyses of strains can be made directly with dna purified from milk or placenta. moreover mlva typing can be standardized and performed at low cost, thus enabling large-scale molecular epidemiology investigations. characterizing isolates provoking clearly defined symptoms will allow the identification of strains deserving full genome sequence determination.

several q-fever outbreaks have been reported in france but their origin is still unidentified  <cit> . the lack of epidemiological markers for c. burnetii led us to make a global analysis of the available coxiella burnetii genome sequence in order to identify polymorphic tandem repeat loci. using  <dig> such loci, we could demonstrate that irs-pcr can divide  <dig> c. burnetii isolates into  <dig> different genotypes whereas mlva differentiates  <dig> genotypes. an additional limitation of irs-pcr is that it is essentially a pattern-based assay, which is not easily amenable to interlaboratory standardization and to the making of international databases. mlva is highly reproducible, has proved to provide efficient discriminatory tools for the molecular typing of bacteria  <cit> , and databases are easy to set-up  <cit>  once a few common decisions for allele calling and marker panels have been made  <cit> .

the discriminatory power of mlva was evaluated using  <dig> c. burnetii isolates. thirty-six genotypes are identified. therefore, we recommend mlva as a valuable tool for epidemiological studies. in particular, we propose to use two panels, panel  <dig> as a first easy screen, which can be used on agarose gels as well as more sophisticated approaches, and a panel  <dig>  which largely corresponds to the panel previously described by svraka et al.  <cit>  and is best typed using a capillary electrophoresis type of equipment. the present study is an additional step towards the development of mlva typing for coxiella burnetii. some of the markers described, in particular panel  <dig> markers, may eventually turn out to be too variable to be of use  when much larger collection of isolates will have been typed. also, as soon as additional genome sequences will be available, it will be possible to search for additional polymorphic tandem repeats which might have been missed in the present investigation because they have less than  <dig> repeat units in the nine mile rs <dig> strain genome sequence analyzed here  <cit> .
