BACKGROUND
dpp-iv  is a cell surface  <dig> kda glycoprotein expressed on epithelial cells and leukocyte subsets possessing dipeptidyl peptidase activity.  <cit> . the dpp-iv enzyme is known to cleave the n-terminal dipeptide from the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide- <dig>  and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide . this cleavage inactivates the hormones thereby neutralizing their prandial insulinotropic effect  <cit> . targeting the dipeptidyl peptidase activity with low molecular weight enzyme inhibitors restores incretin activity and has led to the successful development of a dpp-iv inhibitor, sitagliptin, as an effective therapy for type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . a concern regarding the potential for dpp-iv inhibitors to affect immune function and increase infection rates has been raised  <cit> , although a recently published analysis of safety using pooled source data showed no significant difference in the incidence of overall or specific types of infection  <cit> .

the role of dpp-iv enzymatic activity in immune function has not been extensively studied, however there are a few reports suggesting that dpp-iv can modulate immune responses  <cit> . cell culture studies have implicated dpp-iv as a co-receptor in t cell activation  <cit> . in addition, dpp-iv may affect leukocyte trafficking via cleavage of certain chemokines such as sdf- <dig>  <cit> . dpp-iv null animals were shown have reduced humoral immune responses to pokeweed mitogen  <cit> . in an ova asthma model, rats expressing a truncated inactive form of dpp-iv due to a genetic polymorphism were shown to have reduced t cell recruitment to the lungs and decreased ova-specific ige titers  <cit> . however, studies with dpp-iv deficient animals do not directly address the role of the dipeptidyl peptidase activity as this cell surface protein may possess other non-enzymatic functions  <cit> . in addition, some reports that attributed immunomodulatory effects to dpp-iv enzymatic activity may have been confounded by use of non-selective inhibitors. indeed, we have previously shown that blockade of t cell activation in vitro correlates with inhibitor activity directed against dpp8/ <dig> but not against dpp-iv  <cit> . moreover, inhibitors that were previously reported to modulate t cell responses were found to be potent inhibitors of dpp8/ <dig> activity  <cit> .

to extend these observations to an in vivo setting in order to better characterize any potential role of dpp-iv in immune function, we investigated the t cell-dependent responses in mice using genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of dpp-iv. t cell-dependent antibody responses provides a useful model for addressing immune competence as it is dependent on many factors such as antigen processing and presentation, cd <dig> t cell help, germinal center reactions, b cell activation and differentiation, affinity maturation, and memory cell formation. we report here that genetic ablation or specific inhibition of dpp-iv did not impair t cell-dependent antibody responses. in addition, we find that genetic ablation or specific inhibition of dpp-iv did not compromise cytotoxic t cell function in vivo.

mog p35– <dig> was obtained from sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa. heat-killed mycobacterium tuberculosis was obtained from bd diagnostics, franklin lakes, new jersey, usa. pertussis toxin was obtained from list biological laboratories, campbell, ca, usa. the highly selective dpp-iv inhibitor, des-fluro sitagliptin, was synthesized as previously described  <cit> . to deliver an effective dose of ~ <dig> mg/kg daily, mice were fed a diet consisting of  <dig>  g of this compound per  <dig> kg tekland chow . the enzyme activity of dpp-iv in the blood was assayed as described earlier  <cit> .

t cell-dependent antibody responses
mice were immunized i.p. with  <dig> μg of np-cgg in alum for the primary immunization, and  <dig> μg of np-cgg in pbs i.p. for the secondary immunization  <cit> . mice were bled via the retro orbital sinus at indicated times and the levels of anti-np and cgg antibodies and their isotypes were determined by elisa as described previously  <cit> . briefly, mouse serum antibodies were immobilized onto 96-well plates coated with np-bsa or cgg and detected with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins. the assays were developed using streptavidin-europium and plates were read on victor  <dig>  <dig> multilabel counter . relative affinities of serum antibodies were evaluated by using altered ligand density elisa as described earlier  <cit> .

flow cytometry analysis
cell suspensions prepared from spleens excised from mice on day  <dig> after immunizations were depleted of erythrocytes by ammonium chloride for four-color cell surface staining,  <dig> ×  <dig> cells resuspended in pbs containing 2% bsa were incubated with pre-titered dilutions of gl7-fitc, biotinylated anti-igd, anti-b220-pet-texas red, and  <dig>  g2-pe for  <dig> min at 4°c. sa red  <dig> was used as a second-step reagent. cells were analyzed using a facs calibur cytometer , and the data were analyzed by flowjo software .

immunohistochemistry
spleen isolation, flash freezing, sectioning, and immunohistochemistry were all conducted essentially as described previously  <cit> . gc numbers were determined by counting the number of pna+ structures at 10× magnification.

in vivo cytotoxicity assay
c57bl/ <dig> female and male mice, age  <dig> ~ <dig> weeks, were used for in vivo cytotoxicity assays. female mice were immunized i.p. with syngeneic c57bl/ <dig> male splenocytes  at day  <dig> and boosted at day  <dig> to generate anti-h-y cytotoxic t cells. the in vivo ctl assay was performed as described earlier with some modifications  <cit>  target cells were prepared and adoptively transferred to recipient female mice at day  <dig> post priming and specific killing of target h-y+ cells was analyzed at day  <dig>  briefly, male and female c57bl/ <dig> naïve splenocytes were isolated and depleted of erythrocyte with rbc lysis buffer . the splenocytes were washed 1× with 10% fbs rpmi  <dig> and 2× with pbs. the cell densities were adjusted to 2× <dig> cells/ml. male splenocytes were labeled with a high concentration  of  <dig> -carboxy-fluorescein succinimdyl ester , and the female splenocyte were labeled with low cfse . cfse labeling was carried out by incubating  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in pbs with cfse at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator for  <dig> min and quenched by adding 10% fbs rpmi to a final volume of  <dig> ml. cells were washed 1× with 10%fbs rpmi and 2× with pbs to remove free cfse. male and female splenocytes were mixed 1: <dig> in pbs for the adoptive transfer.  <dig> cells in  <dig> μl pbs were injected into recipient female mice via tail vein injection. similar amounts of cell were injected into the control unimmunized female mice. spleens from the recipient mice were harvested after  <dig> hr, and splenocytes were analyzed for specific killing of h-y+ target cells by facs. at least  <dig>  cfse positive cells were analyzed. the recovery and percent killing of the cfse-labeled targets were calculated as follows:

RESULTS
intact t cell-dependent antibody responses in dpp-iv knockout mice
the cd26-/- mice were generated as described earlier  <cit> . briefly, exons  <dig> and  <dig> were replaced with neomycin which led to elimination of cd <dig> expression on the surface as determined by facs. there was no dpp- <dig> enzyme activity detected in the plasma of these mice. dpp-iv knockout animals had no major differences in the leukocytes populations in spleen, thymus and blood as compared to their wild type controls . dpp-iv null mice and their wild type littermate control animals were immunized with np-cgg in alum and the primary humoral immune response was measured at day  <dig> . the animals were boosted at day  <dig> with np-cgg in pbs to measure secondary humoral immune response  <dig> days later. the primary anti-np response is dominated by λ bearing antibodies and b cells that make these antibodies are recruited into the memory compartment. these memory b cells secrete high affinity antibodies upon re-challenge with antigen. there were no differences observed in the primary and secondary anti np λ-responses between the dpp-iv null and wild type control animals . these antibodies in the secondary responses were predominantly of high affinity as determined by the altered ligand density assay  <cit>  in which antibody titers are assayed by elisa using different hapten  density capture . higher affinity antibodies bind high and low np-capture plates equally well and hence the ratio of titers is close to  <dig>  lower affinity antibodies bind better to high np-coated plates compared to low np-coated plates and hence the ratio of titers are <  <dig>  there were no differences observed in the dominant anti-np lambda bearing or igg <dig> antibody titers between the two groups of animals during the primary or secondary anti-np response . furthermore affinity matured antibodies produced by memory b cells upon boosting were equivalent between the two groups as measured by the ratio of titers on np2/np <dig>  antibody titers to the carrier protein cgg are dominated by the g <dig> bearing heavy chain and these were unaltered in the dpp-iv null animals . all the other isotypes were also unaltered in the dpp-iv null mice as compared to the control animals . equivalent responses were also observed between the cd <dig> null and control animals immunized with np-ova and unconjugated ova . these results indicate intact antigen specific t cell-dependent antibody responses in the dpp-iv-/- animals.

we also investigated whether germinal center  reactions were dependent on dpp-iv. germinal centers are secondary lymphoid structures formed in response to antigen and are obligately dependent on the presence of helper t cells and b cells during the anti-np humoral responses  <cit> . splenic gc were evaluated in mice  <dig> days post immunization. the size of the gc response was evaluated by enumerating gl7+ gc b cells by facs  <cit>  and the number of germinal centers via ihc . there were no differences in the overall gc reactions as determined by size, frequency  or numbers of gc b cells  in dpp-iv-/- mice as compared to control animals. therefore the data indicate that the t cell-dependent antibody responses in dpp-iv-/- animals are intact.

intact t cell-dependent antibody responses in mice treated with a highly selective dpp-iv inhibitor
pharmacological inhibition of dpp-iv was achieved with a highly selective compound des-fluro sitagliptin . des-fluoro-sitagliptin has properties that are virtually indistinguishable from sitagliptin itself  <cit> . indeed, it differs from sitagliptin by only  <dig> fluorine molecule. this compound does not inhibit dpp- <dig> - <dig>  proline dipeptidase, prolyl endopeptidase, fibroblast activation protein, amino peptidase p and prolidase at > <dig> μm  <cit>  the compound  was milled into rodent chow at ~ <dig> mg/kg. this concentration of compound was sufficient to give >90% inhibition of dpp-iv enzyme activity that was sustained for  <dig> hours . similar to the dpp-iv-/- animals, the total anti-np response as measured by λ-bearing and g <dig> isotype were unaltered in animals with pharmacological inhibition of the dpp-iv enzyme activity . moreover, the ability to produce high affinity antibodies from memory b cell stimulation was intact in drug treated animals as observed from the ratios of np2/np <dig> elisa . the titers of other isotypes  and anti-cgg igg <dig> were similar in the drug treated and control animals . these data therefore show that there are no differences in the amplitude or quality of antibody responses between c57bl/ <dig> controls or drug treated animals. therefore pharmacological blockade of the dpp-iv enzyme activity has no effect on the primary and secondary t cell-dependent antibody responses to model antigens.

the animals were fed chow milled with  <dig>  grams of desflurositagliptin in  <dig> kg of tekland chow to deliver an effective dose of  <dig> mpk. blood were drawn  <dig> hours apart and dpp iv enzyme activity measured as described earlier. the animals  were maintained on the inhibitor for the entire period of the experiment.

intact t cell recall responses in dpp-iv knockout or inhibitor-treated mice
wild type and dpp-iv-/- mice were immunized i.p. with ovalbumin in alum and the draining mesenteric lymph-node t cells were stimulated with various concentrations of ova in vitro . t cells from the dpp-iv-/- mice proliferated in a dose dependent manner to ova which were similar to that observed in the wild type animals . in addition, there was no difference observed in the amounts of il- <dig> produced between the two groups .

recently, it has been reported that the t cell proliferative recall responses to mogp35– <dig> peptide were higher in dpp-iv-/- mice as compared to the wild type controls  <cit> . in contrast to this report, our data did not reveal any enhancement of t cell responses upon re-stimulation with mogp35– <dig> in draining lymph node  or splenic cells  in mice with genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of dpp-iv activity. this is consistent with our data showing intact t cell recall responses to ova in dpp-iv-/- mice.

intact cytotoxic t cell responses in dpp-iv knockout or inhibitor treated mice
in order to evaluate a potential role for dpp-iv in cd <dig> t cell function, cytotoxicity was measured using an in vivo ctl assay with target cells expressing a minor mhc mismatch . female mice where primed with the male cells from the same genetic background leading to mismatches in the male  antigen expressed on these cells. the primed mice were challenged with a 1: <dig> mixture of differentially cfse-labeled male and female cells. the cd <dig> cytotoxic t cells generated should only kill the male cells and the killing of female cells serves as control to document non-specific cytotoxicity. there were no differences observed in the cd <dig> t cell cytotoxicity between the wild type, dpp-iv-/- and inhibitor treated wild type animals. all the three groups demonstrated ~67% killing of male cells . as a positive control, fk <dig>  a well characterized t cell immunosuppressant, dosed on  during priming and boosting showed a statistically significant decrease in cd <dig> t cell mediated killing of male cells  as compared to untreated wild type animals. these results demonstrate that genetic ablation of dpp-iv or pharmacological inhibition of dpp-iv enzyme activity did not alter cd <dig> t cell cytotoxicity.

discussion
inhibition of dpp-iv is an effective therapy for type ii diabetes. since this protein is also expressed on the surface of t cells, it is conceivable that dpp-iv inhibitors could have immunomodulatory activity. this possibility was tested by assessing t cell-dependent immune responses in pre-clinical models using both dpp-iv knockout mice and mice treated with a highly selective dpp-iv inhibitor. this inhibitor, des-fluro sitagliptin, has no activity against other dipeptidyl peptidases including dpp- <dig>  dpp- <dig> and dpp- <dig> . several distinct types of assays were used to evaluate in vivo t cell-dependent responses after antigen challenge including measurements of serum antibody titers, t cell recall responses, and cytotoxic t cell killing activity. we found that loss of dpp-iv activity had no significant effect in any of these t cell-dependent immune response assays.

dpp-iv knockout animals did not show any difference in the kinetics, amplitude or quality of antigen specific antibody responses to a hapten or the protein cgg. in addition, the germinal center reaction, affinity maturation and isotype switching of antibodies, all obligately dependent on t cell help, were similar in wild type and dpp-iv knockout animals. moreover, treatment of animals with a dpp-iv inhibitor did not alter any of the parameters described above showing that dpp-iv enzyme activity is not essential for mounting t cell- dependent antibody responses.

recently it has been reported that dpp-iv knockout mice t cell exhibited enhanced proliferative responses to a self peptide mogp35– <dig>  <cit> . despite using similar experimental procedures, our results failed to reproduce these observations in two independent experiments. in addition, treatment of mice with the dpp-iv inhibitor, des-fluro sitagliptin, did not have any significant effect on mog-specific t cell recall responses. the reason for this discrepancy is uncertain. of note, the lack of effect of dpp-iv inhibition on mog-specific immune responses is similar to results seen for other protein antigens such as cgg and ova. these results strongly suggest that dpp-iv does not play a significant role in t cell recall responses to protein antigens.

cd <dig> t cells play an important role in immunity against intracellular pathogens. we investigated the effects of dpp-iv blockade on in vivo cytotoxic t cell functions by challenging the female mice with male cells to generate h-y specific cytotoxic t cells. the primed animals challenged with male cells demonstrated equivalent cytotoxicity when the dpp-iv expression was genetically ablated or the dpp-iv enzyme activity blocked with des-fluro sitagliptin in comparison to the wild type animals . these results indicate that the cd <dig> t cell cytotoxic function is intact in animals with dpp-iv blockade.

our data add to and extend the earlier observation that the dpp-iv enzyme activity is not required for t cell activation or co-stimulating properties in vitro   <cit> . busso et al have observed no effects of cd <dig> deficiency on in vitro or in vivo proliferation of lymph node and spleen cells nor on in vivo antibody response to mbsa immunization  <cit> . furthermore, although lower igg <dig> and igg2a titers were found in cd <dig> knockout animals as compared to wild type mice immunized with poke weed mitogen  in the primary response  <cit>  these differences were eliminated upon boosting with pwm. earlier reports assessing the effect of dpp-iv on t cell functions have used inhibitors that were non-selective against other dipeptidyl peptidases  <cit> . the compound des-fluro sitagliptin used in the current studies is structurally similar to sitagliptin, a highly selective dpp-iv inhibitor that is approved for clinical use in type ii diabetic patients. we have previously shown that highly selective dpp-iv inhibitors do not impair t cell activation in vitro, in contrast to less selective inhibitors that cross-inhibit dpp <dig> and dpp <dig>  <cit> . the current studies extend these observations by showing that highly selective inhibition of dpp-iv does not disrupt t cell responses in vivo.

while dpp-iv does not appear to affect t cell-dependent responses, this protein could modulate other types of immune responses. for example, in humans, dpp-iv is reported to associate with adenine deaminase  on the surface of the t cell and could prevent the inhibitory effects of adenosine on t cell proliferation  <cit> . the crystal structures of both the sitagliptin/dpp-iv complex and the ada/dpp-iv complex have been solved. while sitagliptin binds dpp-iv to inhibit its enzymatic activity  <cit> , this binding does not alter the overall conformation of the dpp-iv molecule, including the aspect of the molecule that binds to ada  <cit> . therefore, sitagliptin is highly unlikely to alter the ada-binding properties of dpp-iv. however, since the cd <dig> molecule does not associate with ada in mice its impact on t-cell function cannot be addressed in rodents  <cit> . dpp-iv has also been reported to associate with cd <dig> and could thereby modulate signal transduction  <cit> . we did not directly address functions that could be altered by disrupting the cell surface association of cd <dig> with dpp-iv. of note, inhibition of dpp-iv enzymatic activity would not be expected to affect the association of dpp-iv with other cell surface proteins. our studies focus on the role of dpp-iv in in vivo t-cell functions. several studies including work done by morimoto et al has implicated potentially diverse roles for dpp-iv in human t-cell functions. for instance expression of cd <dig> on t-cells has been associated with co-stimulatory functions  <cit> . studies performed by this group have used isolated t-cells stimulated in vitro in a variety of ways . indeed, the more recent results from this group focus on dissecting in vitro protein-protein interactions and signaling by the cd <dig> molecule and its putative ligand, caveolin- <dig>  dpp-iv was reported to have co-stimulatory activity in studies using isolated t-cells or t-cell lines stimulated by cross-linking surface cd <dig> with antibodies  <cit> . however, the physiological relevance of these studies is uncertain, e.g., endogenous cross-linking ligands have not been identified and, clearly, there is much work to be done to further establish the potential physiologic role that cd <dig> might play in immune processes.

isolated human th <dig> cells expressed three to six fold more cd <dig> protein than th <dig> cells and were more responsive to anti-dpp-iv cross-linking  <cit> . interestingly, dpp-iv enzyme activities were equivalent in both th <dig> and th <dig> cells. dpp-iv could have different role in distinct t-cell populations. the potential role of dpp-iv in other t-cell subsets th <dig>  treg requires further studies.

it has been previously shown that dpp-iv is capable of in vitro cleavage of sdf-1α and a number of other chemokines like cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl3l <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> in vitro   <cit> . recently it was shown that dpp <dig> could also cleave cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in vitro  <cit> . however, whether cleavage of these chemokines occurs in vivo has yet to be demonstrated and thus the physiological relevance is uncertain. dpp-iv-/- mice were found to be resistant to g-csf mediated mobilization of hematopoietic stem cell, suggesting a potential role for dpp-iv in regulating sdf-1α in the bone marrow  <cit> . this has led to the postulation that dpp-iv inhibitors could be clinical useful for bone marrow transplantation.

CONCLUSIONS
the manuscript provides important data on the role of dpp-iv on t-cell immune function. genetic ablation of dpp-iv or pharmacological inhibition of its enzymatic activity had no measurable effect on t cell-dependent immune responses in mice. while there may be limitations regarding extrapolation of the results to humans, these results are consistent with the favorable clinical experience with sitagliptin, to date.
