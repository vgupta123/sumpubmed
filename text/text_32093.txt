BACKGROUND
the gram-positive skin commensal propionibacterium acnes is ubiquitously present on human skin. it has been speculated that this bacterium contributes to healthy skin by deterring the colonization of severe pathogens  <cit> ; however, it is most well known for its role in skin disorders such as acne vulgaris  <cit> . acne, a multifactorial disorder related to the formation of comedones, hormonal stimulation, bacterial colonization and the host inflammatory response, is an extremely common condition affecting approximately 80% of adolescents. despite intense research effort, the precise role of p. acnes in acne formation is still unclear  <cit> .

in addition to acne, p. acnes has been frequently associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases, including prosthetic joint infections, shunt-associated central nervous system infections, endocarditis, sarcoidosis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, allergic alveolitis, pulmonary angitis, acne inversa , and the sapho  syndrome  <cit> . this bacterium is also a common isolate of prostatic glands from patients with prostate inflammation  <cit> . interestingly, the role of p. acnes in the development of prostate cancer through an inflammatory mechanism is currently a subject of much speculation  <cit> .

the prevalence of p. acnes in the above-mentioned conditions suggests that this bacterium is an etiological agent of infection and that it possesses an elevated pathogenic potential. p. acnes has been shown to exhibit haemolytic and cytotoxic activities  <cit>  as well as extensive immunostimulatory activity and complement activation  <cit> . p. acnes isolates differ in their virulence properties, such as in their ability to trigger production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in infected keratinocytes  <cit> . the genetic basis for this has not yet been studied in detail. to date four phylogenetic groups of p. acnes have been described, designated types ia, ib, ii and iii, based on sequence differences in two genes, namely reca and tly  <cit> .

despite the apparent role of p. acnes in disease formation, information on putative pathogenic traits and antigenic substances of this bacterium is scarce. the complete genome sequence of a cutaneous type ib isolate of p. acnes  provided insights into the pathogenic potential of p. acnes, revealing numerous gene products with putative host tissue-degrading activities as well as predicted cell wall-associated and secreted proteins, the presence or activity of which might be involved in triggering host tissue inflammation  <cit> . some of these proteins are differentially expressed among p. acnes isolates and were shown to be immunoreactive  <cit> .

to shed light on the biological relevance of predicted genes from the genome sequence, we used a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis  and matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry  to identify proteins secreted by p. acnes. isolates representing all four phylotypes were investigated. several hydrolases and putative virulence factors were secreted by all strains tested. these factors are potential host-interacting factors, likely important in inflammatory responses to p. acnes, as observed in acne vulgaris. thus, our data provide a basis to guide further in-depth studies on individual factors.

RESULTS
choice of p. acnes strains
we selected five strains of p. acnes for analysis of their secreted proteins. these strains, representing all known p. acnes phylotypes, i.e. types ia, ib, ii and iii, were isolated from a range of tissue sites: a type ii skin acne isolate ; a type iii strain isolated from a post-operative prosthetic joint infection ; a type ia strain isolated from a pleuropulmonary infection ; and two type ib strains: a skin isolate for which the genome sequence is available ; and an isolate from a cancerous prostate .

2-de-maldi-ms analysis of p. acnes culture supernatants
to identify proteins secreted by p. acnes using proteome analysis, we cultured each strain under anaerobic conditions in brain heart infusion  broth, previously used for secretome analyses  <cit> . growth curves were generated  and culture supernatants were harvested in the mid-exponential phase. precipitated proteins from supernatants were separated by 2-de and coomassie stained, generating reproducible secretomes of all five strains tested . all visible protein spots were analyzed by maldi-ms and searched against the ncbi non-redundant database, which included  the genome sequence of the type ib strain kpa and the partial genome sequence of the type ia strain sk- <dig> 

the identified proteins for each strain, with molecular weights, isoelectric points, mascot scores and sequence coverage are listed in additional file  <dig>  in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> protein spots for p. acnes strains  <dig>  kpa, p <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were unambiguously identified and assigned to database entries. several proteins occurred in spot series, representing different protein species of the same protein. post-translational modifications are a likely explanation, resulting in altered molecular masses and/or isoelectric points  <cit> . a few ms spectra originating from secreted proteins of strain  <dig> could not be assigned to any database entry , indicating that these proteins are strain-specific. the inability to identify these proteins also reflects the absence of genome sequence data from type ii and type iii strains; only genome sequences from type i strains are currently available.

twenty commonly secreted proteins of p. acnes
the identified proteins secreted by the five strains tested were assigned to the reference kpa genome . a set of  <dig> proteins was secreted by at least three of the five strains, including eight proteins secreted by all strains . all  <dig> proteins were secreted by the p <dig> strain, whereas  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these proteins were secreted by the kpa,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively. we cannot exclude, however, that proteins secreted at lower levels were missed by our approach, as the amount of secretion varied between the strains and the sensitivity of the coomassie stain is limited to the  <dig> ng range.

at least three of the five p. acnes strains secrete the listed proteins; see additional file  <dig> for a complete list of identified proteins. re-annotation was performed for each gene. a sp, signal peptide; tat, twin-arginine motif; b semi-quantification based on coomassie stained gels

all  <dig> proteins except one, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , carried a secretion signal in its n-terminus. p. acnes has a general secretion /signal recognition particle  and a twin-arginine translocation  secretion system. other secretion systems have not been reported for p. acnes, and rescanning of the genome sequence gave no indication that additional ones exist.

hydrolytic enzymes are secreted by p. acnes
to gain insight into the biological functions of the  <dig> commonly secreted proteins, re-annotation was performed based on similarity searches against protein sequence and protein-domain/-family databases . many of the secreted proteins were found to have predicted hydrolytic activities: two genes  are predicted endo-glycoceramidases, sharing 42% identity on the protein level. although their substrate specificities are unknown, ppa <dig> and ppa <dig> share 27% and 30% protein identity, respectively, with the characterized and structurally analyzed endo-glycoceramidase ii from rhodococcus sp., which hydrolyzes glycosidic linkages between the oligosaccharide and ceramide moieties of gangliosides  <cit> . another secreted protein, ppa <dig>  a glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> protein, shares 31% identity on the protein level with nagz  of b. subtilis. nagz is a β-n-acetylglucosaminidase involved in the peptidoglycan recycling pathway; it cleaves the terminal non-reducing n-acetylglucosamine of muropeptides  <cit> . p. acnes also secreted a putative lysozyme  which is 47% identical on the protein level to the muramidase from streptomyces coelicolor. this muramidase not only cleaves the β- <dig> -glycosidic bond between n-acetylmuramic acid and n-acetylglucosamine units, but also exhibits β- <dig> -n,6-o-diacetylmuramidase activity, enabling this enzyme to degrade staphylococcus aureus cell walls  <cit> . whether ppa <dig> is an autolytic lysozyme involved in cell wall turnover has still to be elucidated. however, the peptidoglycan of p. acnes contains non-n-acetylated glucosamine residues and is therefore resistant to lysozyme  <cit> . we speculate that ppa <dig> has a different substrate specificity, acting on non-n-acetylated peptidoglycan, or, alternatively, it acts as a defense system against competing bacteria on the skin.

two strains, kpa and  <dig>  secreted a hyalorunate lyase , confirming previous investigations on a p. acnes protein with hyalorunate lyase activity  <cit> . preliminary functional characterization revealed that the enzyme exerted activity against chondroitin 4- and 6-sulphates but not against dermatan sulphate  <cit> . in accordance, the closest characterized homolog, the chondroitin lyase of arthrobacter aurescens  acts on chondroitin sulfate but not on dermatan sulfate  <cit> . similar to other chondroitin lyases, it is capable of cleaving hyaluronan, a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan and a major component of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues.

consistent with the known lipolytic activity of p. acnes  <cit> , we identified lipolytic enzymes in the secretory fraction, including the previously characterized triacylglycerol lipase, designated glycerol-ester hydrolase a . geha is recognized as one of the virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of acne  <cit> , and is thought to be the main enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of sebum triacylglycerides, resulting in the release of glycerol and free fatty acids. the released fatty acids are thought to be inflammatory; they favor ductal hypercornification and increase adhesion between p. acnes and cells of the hair follicle, promoting colonization of p. acnes and biofilm formation  <cit> . furthermore, geha itself is a strong chemotactic factor  <cit> . other secreted esterases identified include a putative lysophospholipase  and a putative phosphoesterase  with unknown specificities. proteases, another class of secreted hydrolases, were also detected, e.g. a peptidase s8/s <dig> family protein  among others; their substrate specificities remain to be elucidated.

camp factors and other secreted proteins
a set of five highly similar p. acnes genes  in the genome of p. acnes kpa encodes homologs to christie-atkins-munch-petersen  factors, which are co-haemolytic proteins, found mainly in streptococcal species  <cit> . camp factors have been characterized as pathogenic determinants that exert lethal effects when administered to rabbits and mice  <cit> . in addition, streptococcal camp factors have been reported to act as pore-forming toxins  <cit> . in agreement with previous work  <cit> , all p. acnes strains examined here were positive for the co-haemolytic camp reaction . our secretome data showed that all tested p. acnes strains secreted camp <dig> . in addition, the skin isolate kpa secreted camp <dig> . secretion of the other three camps was not observed in any strain using our approach. a previous study reported variable production of camp factors in different p. acnes isolates, as detected by western blotting experiments using different anti-camp sera  <cit> ; the authors reported an abundance of camp <dig> in type ib and ii strains. we did not find camp <dig> among the secreted proteins; a discrepancy that could be due to the detection limits of the different techniques used, i.e. our ms analysis detects the most prominently secreted factors, whereas immunoblotting is a more sensitive technique.

a key enzyme of glycolysis, gapdh, was also secreted by three out of the five p. acnes strains tested. at first glance it is peculiar why a glycolysis enzyme should be secreted; however, a number of studies have identified gapdh as an anchorless, multifunctional protein, displayed on the surface of several fungi and gram-positive pathogens, which contributes to adhesion and virulence  <cit> . in streptococcus pyogenes, this cell-associated and soluble protein is also known as streptococcal surface dehydrogenase  and as a plasmin receptor ; its complement c5a-binding activity was shown to play a role in evasion of neutrophil recruitment to sites of infection  <cit> . moreover, in s. agalactiae, gapdh is an immunomodulatory factor, exhibiting b lymphocyte-stimulatory activity  <cit> .

in addition to the above-mentioned proteins, several  hypothetical secreted proteins were detected. three of these hypothetical proteins are encoded by a gene cluster , with homologs only in corynebacterium spp. three additional secreted proteins  are unique to p. acnes; ppa <dig> contains characteristic repeats of the dipeptide proline-threonine , similar to other putative adhesins , and ppa <dig> was secreted most strongly by all tested strains. future work will determine the function of this abundantly secreted protein.

strain-specific secretion of putative adhesions
as expected, the secretomes of the type ib strains, kpa and p <dig>  share a higher degree of similarity with each other than with the other three strains tested. nevertheless, we identified a few prominent differences between kpa and p6:  kpa secreted both camp <dig> and camp <dig>  by contrast, p <dig> exclusively secreted camp2;  kpa was the only strain which secreted ppa <dig>  a protein unique to p. acnes and with no homology to proteins stored in any database. a likely explanation for the kpa-specific expression of the gene encoding ppa <dig> is a duplication of a  <dig> bp repeat within the 5'-end of the gene in strains  <dig> and p <dig> . this duplication results in the insertion of four amino acids just after the predicted cleavage site of the signal peptide, which potentially alter secretion;  likewise, ppa <dig>  which also has no existing homology to other proteins but contains characteristic pt repeats , was secreted exclusively by p <dig>  interestingly, ppa <dig> possesses a phase variation-like signature - a stretch of guanine residues, located within the putative promoter region. sequencing of the upstream region of ppa <dig> revealed a variable number of guanine residues in the three strains  . changes in the number of guanine residues alter the length of the spacer region of the putative promoter. thus, observed differences in spacer lengths -  <dig> nt in p <dig> ,  <dig> nt in kpa and  <dig> nt in  <dig> - may explain why ppa <dig> expression is p6-specific. alternatively, if the guanine tract is assumed to be part of the n-terminus of ppa <dig>  frameshifts leading to truncated proteins would be introduced in kpa and  <dig>  but not in p <dig> .

a number of major differences were detected between strains belonging to phylotypes ia and ib: in comparison to the two type ib strains , strain  <dig>  a type ia strain, exhibited  reduced lysozyme  secretion, and  increased secretion of the lipase geha;  in addition, strain  <dig> exclusively secreted ppa <dig>  ppa <dig>  is a host cell-surface attachment protein with dermatan-sulphate-binding activity and has immunoreactive properties  <cit> . the corresponding gene is associated with a putative phase variation signature; variable expression in different p. acnes strains has been observed and attributed to mutated start codons or alterations in the length of the homopolymeric cytosine tract in the 5'-end of the gene  <cit> . comparison of ppa <dig> gene sequences from kpa, p <dig> and  <dig> revealed that the start codon was mutated in kpa. in strain p <dig> the length of the cytosine tract was altered, leading to a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon . in addition, the number of pt repeats within the c-terminus of ppa <dig> varied. these repeats were more numerous in strain  <dig> as compared to the two type ib strains .

strain  <dig>  a type ii strain, secreted a few proteins  which could not be assigned to any known protein. maldi-ms identification and subsequent homology searches against the genomes of p. acnes and the whole ncbi database retrieved no significant matches, indicating that these proteins are unique to strain  <dig> 

strain  <dig>  a type iii strain, secreted fewer factors than any of the other strains. one protein, ppa <dig>  an outer membrane lipoprotein of the periplasmic binding proteins  superfamily, was secreted solely by strain  <dig>  ppa <dig> exhibits a 38% protein identity to the membrane-associated glycylmethionine binding protein  of staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , indicating a potential role as a dipeptide transporter for ppa <dig> 

secretome of p. acnes  <dig> in stationary growth phase
to investigate growth phase-dependent secretion, p. acnes was grown to stationary phase. we selected strain  <dig> for this analysis as it was found to aggregate strongly upon reaching the stationary phase . 2-de/maldi-ms analysis of strain  <dig> culture supernatants revealed approximately half of the identified spots  corresponded to proteins already identified as being secreted during the mid-exponential phase . the other spots corresponded to proteins mainly involved in key metabolic pathways and that are known to be primarily located in the bacterial cytoplasm. thus, it is most likely that lysis of p. acnes occurred in the stationary phase, releasing the most abundant cytosolic proteins. enzymes of key pathways such as glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were identified, including phosphoglyceromutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, fumarate hydratase, and succinyl-coa synthetase. in addition, we detected amino acid-converting proteins, i.e. serine hydroxymethyltransferase, tryptophanase and ornithine carbamoyltransferase. other identified proteins included elongation factors, catalase,  <dig> kda chaperonin as well as the fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme acyl-carrier-protein s-malonyltransferase. only two proteins with a typical signal peptide, which were not detected in the exponential phase-secretome, were identified: ppa <dig>  an extracellular solute-binding protein, and ppa <dig>  another protein containing a long stretch of pt repeats. ppa <dig>  designated as dermatan-binding protein pa- <dig>  was previously identified as being immunoreactive  <cit>  and shares many properties with the above-mentioned protein ppa <dig> . to unambiguously identify the stationary phase secretome of p. acnes future work is required to reduce the number of 'contaminating'  proteins; for instance, the choice of the culture medium might influence cell lysis. in addition, it is necessary for comparative reasons to determine the complete proteome of the cytoplasmic fraction.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the ubiquitous presence of p. acnes, our knowledge of this bacterium remains limited, in particular regarding the factors allowing its growth on human tissues. many studies have shown that p. acnes has the ability to act as an opportunistic pathogen, with suggested etiological roles in a variety of inflammatory diseases. due to its immune-stimulatory activity, it seems plausible that p. acnes causes inflammation within blocked sebaceous follicles or when it grows in tissue sites unaccustomed and/or hostile to this anaerobic bacterium. hence, the ability of p. acnes to acquire and process growth substrates from its host, especially in the harsh environment of human skin, is dependent on the factors this bacterium secretes. the detection and identification of such factors are therefore important steps in further understanding p. acnes pathogenesis. our study has highlighted the prevalence of secreted hydrolases likely to be involved in degrading human tissue components. other identified proteins such as immunoreactive adhesins have a putative role in virulence. secreted factors may also fulfill other functions such as defending against competing organisms and the evasion of the immune response. functional characterization of these secreted factors is a necessary and logical next step, which requires the development of appropriate tools, e.g. a mutagenesis approach to create p. acnes knock-out mutants. another challenge for the future lies in the elucidation of the molecular basis for observed differences in virulence between p. acnes isolates. the relationship between phylotypes  and strain properties remains obscure; some properties, for instance the ability to trigger production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in keratinocytes, seem to be phylotype-specific  <cit> , whereas other properties, e.g. biofilm formation, are not  <cit> . recent work has shown that an extended typing method based on serotyping in tandem with sequence comparison of three genes  could distinguish invasive from non-invasive p. acnes isolates  <cit> ; thus, this approach may be more appropriate for typing p. acnes isolates. in addition, our secretome analyses has revealed differences not only between but within phylotypes. a more extensive comparative analysis of p. acnes isolates incorporating robust phylotype identification will help to further our understanding of strain specificities.
