BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  are an important cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, particularly in brazil . epec strains produce a characteristic intestinal histopathology called the attaching-and-effacing  lesion, which is characterized by microvilli effacement and intimate bacterial adherence to the epithelial membrane. the genes responsible for a/e lesion phenotype are encoded on  <dig> -kb chromosomal pathogenicity island known as the locus of enterocyte effacement . the lee island comprises approximately  <dig> genes and encodes the components of a type iii secretion system, various effector molecules, and the intimin adhesin which is encoded by the eae gene  <cit> .

epec strains are classified into typical and atypical based on the presence of the large virulence epec adherence factor  plasmid  <cit> . the eaf plasmid encodes a type iv fimbria known as the bundle-forming pilus  that mediate localized adherence  to epithelial cells . a 14-gene operon is necessary for bfp production  <cit> , with bfpa encoding the major structural subunit . a second operon on the eaf plasmid is the plasmid-encoded regulator , consisting of three genes   <cit> , which activates genes within the lee and the bfp operon .

additional criteria for classifying isolates as epec include the detection of specific serogroups  <cit> . classic epec o serogroups include o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis of allelic differences among housekeeping genes, typical epec strains have been subtyped into two major lineages, previously designated epec <dig> and epec <dig>  <cit> . the epec <dig> includes widespread serotypes such as o55:h <dig> and o119:h <dig>  whereas epec <dig> consists of serotypes with more limited occurrence such as o111:h <dig> and o114:h <dig>  based on a whole-genome phylogeny and analysis of type iii secretion system effectors, typical epec strains have been demonstrated to cluster in three main lineages, designated epec <dig>  epec <dig>  and epec <dig>  <cit> . according to the phylogenomic analyses by hazen et al.  <cit>  the term atypical epec refers to a group of phylogenetically diverse isolates than often are more similar to e. coli of other pathovars than epec. however, although the term atypical epec may be considered misleading, atypical strains are identified by the presence of eae and the absence of the eaf probe sequence as well as the shiga toxin-encoded genes  <cit> .

a 1-kb cryptic region of eaf plasmid has been widely used as a genetic probe for epec detection  <cit> . however, some epec strains, as demonstrated by bfp production, may in fact harbor an eaf plasmid lacking the eaf probe sequence  <cit> , which makes the differentiation between typical and atypical complex  <cit> . other epec strains harbor an eaf plasmid that shares a conserved backbone, and is in many ways similar to pmar <dig> plasmid of epec <dig> strain e2348/ <dig> and pb <dig> plasmid of epec <dig> strain b <dig>  but with inactivating deletions in the bfp and per operons that are required for la  <cit> . such strains are phenotypically “atypical”, since they do not produce a typical la pattern on epithelial cells, even though they carry probe-detectable eaf plasmids. in this study, we report the genetic analysis of the eaf plasmid-encoded genes in a collection of epec clinical isolates.

RESULTS
in this study, we analyzed a collection of  <dig> epec clinical isolates, including strains of the classic and nonclassic epec serotypes, which were previously classified as typical  or atypical  by eaf probe reactivity. initially, all  <dig> strains were screened for the eaf probe sequence by using a pcr with primers located  <dig> nucleotides upstream  and  <dig> nucleotides downstream  the eaf sequence of pmar <dig>  <cit> . as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the majority of typical strains yielded the expected 1260-bp amplicon. interestingly no pcr product was obtained from a subset of  <dig> typical strains,  <dig> of which belonged to o <dig> serogroup. to verify this, a new primer located  <dig> nucleotides upstream perb  was designed to include the region between perbc and eaf sequence. all  <dig> typical strains showed a pcr product approximately  <dig> -kb smaller than the expected . dna sequencing revealed the presence of a  <dig> pb deletion not previously reported, in the region between 1093-bp downstream perc and 616-bp of the eaf fragment. as expected all the atypical strains were pcr-negative.table  <dig> results of pcr and hybridization for eaf-encoded genes among typical epec strains

as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the bfpa, bfpg, and per genes, detected by pcr and colony blot hybridization, were present in all typical strains. in addition,  <dig>  atypical strains presented the per genes, and  <dig>  also presented the bfpa gene. among the  <dig> strains,  <dig> strains belonged to the serotypes o119:h <dig>  o119:hnd, o142:h <dig>  and ont:hnd atypical strains. although  <dig> of  <dig> strains hybridized with the bfpa probe, bfpa could not be amplified by pcr from eight o <dig> strains, suggesting that the 3′end of the gene was deleted and replaced with an is66-like element as described by bortolini et al.  <cit> . to verify this, we carried out pcr with primers targeting the 5′end of bfpa and the is66-like element previously described  <cit> . all the eight o <dig> strains yielded the expected amplicon, and dna sequencing confirmed the presence of a 1053-bp is element inserted into bfpa at position  <dig> with significant similarity to is <dig> . we evaluated the level of expression of bfpa by rt-pcr in the  <dig> bfpa-positive strains. the rt-pcr results showed that the bfpa gene was transcribed only by the strains carrying the intact bfpa gene sequence . two of these strains, a <dig>  and a <dig> , present the la pattern. considering the bfp production as a truly phenotype marker of typical epec strains, these strains are in fact typical epec rather than atypical epec as originally classified by the eaf-probe reactivity.fig.  <dig> agarose gel electrophoresis of the rt-pcr products of o <dig> and o <dig> atypical epec strains. lane <dig>  1-kb ladder plus ; lane  <dig>  e2348/ <dig> strain ; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; lane  <dig>  a131; lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain; and lane  <dig>  a <dig> strain



the eaf plasmids from two well-studied epec strains have been sequenced  <cit> . the major difference between pmar <dig>  and pb <dig>  is the presence of conjugative transfer  genes on pmar <dig>  absent in pb <dig>  <cit> . apart from the tra region, several other orfs are present in pb <dig> but not in pmar <dig>  such as the region orf35– <dig> , the region orf61- <dig> , and the putative chaperonine trcp located between the bfp and per operons flanked by insertion  elements. as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  a subset of typical strains o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> strains were positive for one or more pb <dig> derived-probes, while most of atypical epec strains did not hybridize with one or more of the probes .fig.  <dig> the bfp-orf61- <dig> region of eaf plasmids from different epec strains. diagram  <dig>  eaf plasmid of b171- <dig> strain; diagrams  <dig> and  <dig>  eaf plasmids of typical epec o <dig> strains ; diagrams  <dig> and  <dig>  eaf plasmids of atypical epec o <dig> strains ; diagram  <dig>  eaf plasmid of mb <dig> strain. asterisks indicate truncated genes, and sequences for which no data are available are represented by dashed lines



the sequence of plasmid pb <dig> reveals that a partial is <dig> homolog lies immediately upstream of the per operon  <cit> . this is <dig> element is replaced by a partial is <dig> in o119:h <dig> , o128:h <dig>  and o142:h <dig>  strains containing pera mutation frameshifts, leading to premature truncation and consequent inactivation of the gene  <cit> . okeke et al.  <cit>  developed a multiplex pcr which gives a 650-bp product in strains with the is <dig> element and a 500-bp product in strains that have the is <dig>  and a sspi-based pcr-rflp typing which distinguishes normal pera alleles from those with o119:h <dig>  o128:h <dig>  or o142:h <dig> type-frameshift. as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  all typical strains yielded a 650-bp product, while all  <dig> atypical strains with pera mutation frameshifts yielded a 500-bp product. in addition, all typical strains showed a pera rflp pattern similar to that of control epec strain , while all  <dig> pera probe-positive atypical strains produced a pattern consistent with that of the mb <dig>  the entire pera gene was amplified and sequenced in all  <dig> atypical strains, and dna sequencing confirmed the presence of pera mutation identical to that of mb <dig> strain. these results suggest that the presence of an inactive pera gene could be used to differentiate typical from atypical strains. interestingly, most strains carrying vestiges of eaf plasmid belong to the same serogroups as typical epec, suggesting that these strains may constitute a group of epec strains that carry a defective eaf plasmid rather than atypical epec isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that typical o <dig> strains, which were the most prevalent isolates in são paulo, in the past  <cit> , may contain a deletion within the eaf probe sequence not previously reported. this new finding suggests that care should be taken when using the previously described eaf pcr assay  <cit>  in epidemiological studies for the detection of typical o <dig> strains. in addition, we were able to confirm that some atypical strains carry vestiges of the eaf plasmid .
