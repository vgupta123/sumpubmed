BACKGROUND
the likelihood of epidemic take-off  of an infectious disease introduced into a farm population is dependent upon a number of factors. crucial to that are the pathways and chances for the infection to be transmitted from the primary outbreak to the rest of the population. different types of contact between farms may result in transmission of infection  <cit> . however the movement of livestock has been observed to be the major route of spread of epidemics between farms during the period before the first farm is reported with disease  - the "pre-detection" period. examples include the two largest recent epidemics of contagious livestock diseases in the european union - the outbreak of classical swine fever  in 1997- <dig>  and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease  in  <dig>   <cit> . also, throughout the csf outbreak the rate of between-herd transmission of infection via movements of pigs was much higher than that via any other route  <cit> .

lower and upper limits of the epidemic size in a farm network can be projected by calculating the numbers of farms in the giant strongly- and weakly-connected components, respectively, of the network. using these measures, it has been shown that the possible final size of an epidemic in british livestock networks depends on the time of the year when the primary outbreak becomes infected for the cattle, sheep and mixed farm networks  <cit> . the epidemic size is also dependent upon the location of the primary outbreak  <cit> . in addition, a review of fmd outbreaks in all non-endemic areas of the world during 1992- <dig> suggested that for this  disease the movement of infectious animals through a livestock market/auction at the start of an epidemic contributes the most to the epidemic's final size being exceptionally large   <cit> . therefore the early stages of an epidemic have a profound effect on the final number of farms infected and therefore its ultimate impact  <cit> .

we introduce a framework to analyze livestock movements to evaluate an upper bound on the probability of spread of infection in a farm population from a primary outbreak farm via movements. scottish farm networks are used as a model; the networks are evaluated from  <dig> january  <dig> to  <dig> july  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  farms appeared in the scottish livestock networks from  <dig> january  <dig> to  <dig> july  <dig>  of these,  <dig>  traded sheep,  <dig>  traded cattle and  <dig>  traded pigs, to/from other farms on at least one occasion. we consider both direct movements from the primary outbreak farm to other farms and movements that involve livestock markets. we analyse the dependency of each of these on the time of the year that infection occurs, the length of the infectious period  on the primary outbreak farm, and the species of livestock transmitting the disease.

in this paper, we focus on acute contagious livestock diseases. for these diseases, the length of time between the introduction of infection on the primary outbreak farm and the manifestation of clinical signs of disease in animals  may vary. the primary outbreak farm remains "infectious" throughout the pre-detection period. the length of this period is dependent upon the virulence of the pathogen strain and the species infected. for example, the appearance of clinical signs of fmd is variable between species, with cattle and pigs typically showing signs far earlier than sheep. a  <dig> or  <dig> week farm-infectious period may be realistic when the primary outbreak species are cattle or pigs, whilst a  <dig> or  <dig> week period may be realistic for an outbreak starting in sheep. moreover, for cattle, this would also depend on the strain of fmd virus. in the uk  <dig> fmd outbreak, short pre-detection periods of <  <dig> days were generally observed. however in  <dig> and  <dig>  pre-detection periods of up to  <dig> weeks were observed for a different strain of fmd virus. for csf, an acute form of disease often manifests in 2- <dig> days, but, dependent on the strain, may take up to  <dig> weeks; a less virulent strain causing a sub-acute form of the disease may take even longer to detect. we therefore consider infectious periods on the primary outbreak farm of  <dig> week,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks.

we then consider the number of farms in the first generation of an epidemic spreading through the livestock movement network. we also evaluate how the potential for spread of infection via movements varies between the regions of scotland.

RESULTS
potential for spread of infection from the primary outbreak farm via livestock movements
in the event of an outbreak of an acute contagious livestock disease in scotland, our results show that there would be no spread via livestock movements from a large proportion of primary outbreak farms. for a disease with a  <dig> week,  <dig> week and  <dig> week infectious period, 97%, 91% and 83% of the primary outbreaks, respectively, do not spread disease to other farms . however the movement of livestock  follows an annual cycle and peaks twice per year - in late april/early may and again in mid-august. should the infectious period on the farm be  <dig> week, then the proportion of primary outbreak farms moving livestock to other farms while infectious varied from approximately  <dig> % in late december to at most 8% in the second week of august, with a temporal average of 3%. if the primary outbreak was infectious for  <dig> weeks, this proportion ranged from 4% in late december to at most 19% in the second week of august, and on average was 9%. if the primary outbreak was infectious for  <dig> weeks, this proportion ranged from 9% in late december to 30% in mid-august, with a temporal average of 17%.

the seasonal patterns in the proportion of farms that can spread infection via livestock movements differed between species of livestock. the movement of sheep exhibited a single strong annual peak in mid-august . at this time of the year, the infection would spread to at least  <dig> other farm via sheep movements from >20% of the primary outbreaks infectious for  <dig> weeks, whilst this value dropped to < 8% at all other times of the year. for cattle, the annual maximum of the proportion of farms with off-movements during a 4-week period was lower than for sheep. also in contrast to sheep, this proportion for cattle peaked twice per year - in early may and in mid-august . the peak in august tended to be slightly higher than that in may, with some year-to-year variation. during a 4-week infectious period commencing in mid-august, between 12% and 16% of primary outbreaks would have resulted in spread via cattle movement. the percentage of farms with off-movements of pigs was found to be the lowest of the three species, with spread occurring from <  <dig> % of primary outbreaks at any given time of the year during a 4-week infectious period . there was no obvious seasonality in pig movement.

potential for infection to reach a livestock market
the proportion of primary outbreak farms from which infection can spread to a scottish livestock market via animal movement peaked twice per year - in early may and in mid-august . this was comprised primarily of movements of sheep and cattle. the magnitude and annual cyclicity of the potential for spread to markets was close to the potential for any spread via movements . no pig movements between scottish farms via markets were recorded between january  <dig> and july  <dig> 

numbers of farms in the first-generation of an epidemic
of those primary outbreak farms that did move livestock off during the infectious period, the vast majority moved animals to only  <dig> farm. on the other hand, during a 1-week infectious period, on average  <dig> % of primary outbreaks moved livestock to > <dig> farms . this value rose to  <dig> % for a 2-week infectious period and to  <dig> % for a 4-week infectious period . the maximum number of farms observed to become infected in the first generation varied significantly depending upon the primary outbreak farm and the time of the year infection occurred .

the seasonality in the numbers of farms in the epidemic's first generation was evaluated for a disease transmitted by all livestock with a farm-infectious period of  <dig> weeks. the seasonal patterns of the size of the first generation, in general, followed those of the potential for infection to spread via movements . the average likelihood of > <dig> farms becoming infected in the first generation was relatively low for most of the year, at  <dig> %, but this increased to around 10% for epidemics commencing in mid-august.

regional differences
the potential for infection spread via movements depended not only upon the time of the year infection occurred and the species transmitting, but also upon the location of the primary outbreak farm. we analysed how this potential varied between the nine regions of scotland shown in figure  <dig>  for a disease transmitted by all livestock and the primary outbreak farm remaining infectious for  <dig> weeks. overall, the seasonality of livestock movement was similar across the regions. the highest proportion of farms moving livestock off in any region was in mid-august, with a secondary peak in early may . however, there were differences in the magnitude of the proportion of farms from which infection can spread depending on whether the primary outbreak was located within the scottish mainland or on a scottish island , as well as between individual parts of the mainland  and between individual archipelagos . the regions with the lowest risk were the archipelago of shetland and the central part of the mainland, with a temporal average of 10% and 15% of primary outbreaks respectively resulting in spread. in the highlands and on the outer hebrides archipelago the potential for spread averaged at 18%, whilst this value increased to around 21% in the east borders, west borders and inverurie. the regions with the highest risk were the archipelagos of orkney and inner hebrides, where on average 24% and 27% of primary outbreaks respectively resulted in spread. however, the total numbers of farms moving livestock on these two archipelagos represented a small percentage of the total for scotland during the study period, with only around  <dig>  farms on orkney and  <dig> farms on the inner hebrides.

distance of movement
whilst the results presented above provide an indication of the potential for an epidemic to take off, an analysis of the distances that livestock travel during the epidemic's first generation provides further evidence of the risks associated with disease outbreaks. for the analysis of distances, we assumed that the infectious period on the primary outbreak farm was  <dig> weeks and investigated the distances travelled by cattle, sheep and pigs moved off the farm during this time. the results are summarised in figure  <dig> 

the mean distances travelled by cattle and sheep during the epidemic's first generation  show cyclic annual behaviour similar to that of the potential for infection to spread via movements . dependent upon time of year, the mean distance of movement of cattle or sheep varies from  <dig> km to  <dig> km. cattle travel furthest on average in late april/early may and in late august, with mean distances of 80- <dig> km and 90- <dig> km respectively . mean distances of sheep movement are ≤  <dig> km for the first half of the year and peak at 100- <dig> km in mid-august . the maximum distance of movement during the epidemic's first generation , when averaged over all potential primary outbreak farms, closely mirrors the mean distance moved, with peaks of 100- <dig> km in april/may and 120- <dig> km in august for cattle, and 130- <dig> km in august for sheep . however the maximum distance cattle and sheep may be moved during the epidemic's first generation is between  <dig> km and  <dig> km; there is no obvious seasonality in the maximum distance for cattle; for sheep it tends to peak between august and november. this indicates that, whilst average distances of movement are much lower, there is the potential for infection to spread across very significant distances prior to the detection of the outbreak.

no apparent annual cyclic behaviour is observed for distance of movement of pigs. when the infectious period on the primary outbreak farm is  <dig> weeks, the mean distance of movement during the first generation of an epidemic of a pig disease varies between  <dig> km and  <dig> km, whilst the maximum distance averaged over the primary outbreaks is slightly greater than this, at around  <dig> km. the maximum distance of pig movement varies between  <dig> km and  <dig> km. whilst these maximum distances are significantly lower than in the cattle and sheep networks, there remains the potential for pig infection to be transmitted from the primary outbreak farm to a region several hundred kilometres away.

market-associated risk
all the results presented so far have made the assumption that when movements occur via markets, infection will be transmitted only to the farms buying livestock that originated from the primary outbreak farm. this ignored any amplification of transmission that may occur if the disease is transmitted to the other livestock on the market. this analysis also ignored subsequent spread from the infected farms , i.e. the spread beyond the epidemic's first generation. in order to investigate the maximum potential for amplification of transmission by markets, we now assume that the market is infected upon receiving livestock from the primary outbreak farm, and all subsequent movements from that market result in infection being transmitted to all buying farms, for the length of the infectious period of the market . we analyse this scenario for both cattle and sheep, and for an infectious period of  <dig> weeks. the results for cattle are summarised in figure 7a and for sheep in figure 7b.

for a disease transmitted by cattle, if we assume that once a market is infected all movements from the market spread disease, the mean number of farms infected within  <dig> weeks of the primary outbreak farm becoming infectious is found to peak at 700- <dig> in late april/early may and at 600- <dig> in august . however, if we assume that only movements from the infected farms transmit disease, the number of farms infected after  <dig> weeks is significantly lower, at around 400- <dig> farms in late april/early may and 400- <dig> farms in august . for a disease transmitted by sheep, the peak in mid-august is also somewhat lower, at around 750- <dig> farms when only movements from infected farms spread disease, compared with 1200- <dig> farms when all movements from infected markets are infectious . perhaps more significantly, if we assume that only the livestock from infected farms spread disease, then for outbreaks commencing between january and july of each year, on average, fewer than  <dig> farms become infected, compared with up to  <dig> farms if all movements from infected markets are infectious . these results imply that transmission of infection among animals at the market can amplify the spread of disease in the farm network. if the transmission at markets is likely to occur, the results in figure  <dig>  in which the proportion of primary outbreak farms spreading infection to a market is shown, provide a better indication of the likelihood of a large epidemic occurring. for a less contagious disease, for which the transmission at markets is unlikely, a better indication is the proportion of primary outbreaks spreading infection to any other farm, shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
the primary aim of this paper is to assess the potential for epidemic to take off from a primary outbreak farm via livestock movements prior to disease detection. this potential is measured as the proportion of primary outbreak farms moving livestock to other farms whilst infectious. this analytical set-up is applied to scottish livestock networks. the results demonstrate that the potential for epidemic take-off of a short-lived infection via livestock movements in this farm population is generally low throughout the year, averaging, for a disease transmitted by all livestock species,  <dig>  when the animals on the primary outbreak remain infectious for  <dig> week,  <dig>  for  <dig> weeks, and  <dig>  for  <dig> weeks .

annual cyclicity of livestock movements is similar across regions of scotland, but the maximum potential for infection spread at peak seasons and the average potential throughout the year differ . the latter was highest for primary outbreaks occurring on orkney , and the inner hebrides , while it was the lowest for primary outbreaks on shetland, which alone housed  <dig> % of the farms. therefore, a high potential for spread of infection via movements can be seen for disease introductions into the regions with modest farm populations. here we considered only the potential for spread via livestock movements; other modes of between-farm transmission of infection may depend on the numbers or densities of farms in the region  <cit> .

the potential for any spread from the primary outbreak via movements, and the potential for infectious animals to be moved to a livestock market, appear to depend non-linearly on the length of infectious period on the farm . this may be because, under the standstill requirements, in many cases the movement of livestock off the farm is restricted for some days following an on-movement.

for a disease transmitted only by sheep, the proportion of primary outbreaks resulting in infection spread via movements peaks at a single point of the year - in mid-august . for a cattle-only disease, this potential overall is lower, but also peaks in mid-august . sheep movements in the other parts of great britain also peak in august  <cit> . however, when considered for the entirety of great britain between november  <dig> and october  <dig>  cattle movements were observed to peak in april and october  <cit> . the seasonal adjustment of the surveillance effort to account for the peaks in cattle movements in britain has been previously suggested  <cit> . a vigorous surveillance for contagious livestock diseases in scotland at the peak of cattle and sheep movements in august may provide greatest benefit in terms of precluding significant pre-detection spread of infection between farms via livestock movements.

in august  <dig>  an outbreak of fmd occurred in surrey, england. the farms in scotland were not affected, but the restrictions imposed on the livestock movements due to the outbreak led to sizable consequences for the economy and for animal welfare  <cit> . according to our results, if the virus had been introduced to scotland prior to detection of the outbreak, the likelihood of pre-detection spread via livestock movement would have been at its highest. this episode highlighted the importance of disease surveillance at this time of the year, but also the dilemma between the needs of disease control and the necessity for sufficient animal movement to take place to sustain the functioning of the industry.

the magnitude of the proportion of primary outbreak farms that can move infectious animals to a livestock market and its annual cyclicity are close to that for any spread from the primary outbreak via movements . this is because 86% of sheep movements, 80% of beef and 42% of dairy cattle movements between scottish farms during the study period occurred via markets, accounting for 79% of all the livestock movements. therefore, even though the potential for infection to spread via movements from the primary outbreak in scotland is generally low, if the spread does occur, it is likely via a market. a review of fmd outbreaks in non-endemic areas of the world between  <dig> and  <dig> showed that the movement of infectious animals through a market/auction at the beginning of an epidemic contributes to a large final epidemic size  <cit> . a decrease in the number of cattle movements between farms and markets over the entirety of great britain was reported for  <dig> and  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  <cit> . in scotland on its own, the fraction of cattle movements via markets remained consistently high, from 78% to 82%, and the fraction of sheep movements varied from  <dig> % to 88% each year from  <dig> to  <dig> 

if we assume that once livestock is brought from the primary outbreak to the market, all subsequent movements from the market will transmit infection, in figure  <dig> we see that there is the potential for disease to spread to several hundred farms within  <dig> weeks of the primary outbreak becoming infectious . these results agree with a simulation study which showed that only small-size fmd outbreaks in great britain are possible without the amplification of transmission by an infected market  <cit> . jointly, the results imply that in order to prevent large-scale disease outbreaks occurring in britain, control emphasis should be placed upon the risk of spread from the primary outbreak to a market via movements of cattle or sheep.

in contrast, for a pig disease, the proportion of farms from which infection can spread via movements is very low throughout the year , with no obvious seasonal peaks, and no involvement of the markets. therefore, a large-scale epidemic of a pig disease due to pre-detection spread via movements appears to be unlikely. the scottish pig industry is a fattening industry; therefore the movements are normally confined within the breeder-fattening progeny pyramids, and happen only at certain points of the production cycle. this pyramidal structure of movements may account for the significant differences observed in the risks of epidemic take-off when compared with the cattle and sheep networks. however, our results need to be considered against the likely accuracy of data on pig movements. the movements within the pyramids may be under-reported owing to both source and destination holdings belonging to the same business. our conclusions do agree however with those from a simulation study based on pig movements in sweden, where from no to very limited spread was observed for an epidemic seeded to a fattening or a farrow-to-finish pig herd  <cit> . also, in belgian pig industries the farrow-to-finish herds were reported to have lower numbers of  movements compared to the other types of farms  <cit> .

another aspect of the risk of pre-detection spread of disease in a farm population via movements is the number of farms in the first generation of epidemic. this is defined here as the number of farms receiving livestock from the primary outbreak while it is infectious, and therefore measures the upper limit of the possible first generation, given no disease transmission at markets. in this analysis, the majority of primary outbreaks produce a first generation of  <dig> and a significant fraction produce a first generation of  <dig> farm. however, a small fraction of introductions can result in larger outbreaks. in rare cases up to  <dig> farms can be infected in the first generation . we speculate that such large first generations were observed for primary outbreak farms that were either dealing, or both farming and dealing livestock. dealers have played a part in livestock movements in scotland for decades  <cit> . a comprehensive identification of dealerships would allow efficient targeting of control to curtail the risk of pre-detection spread of epidemics via livestock movements. also, seasonal sheep shows in scotland can be held on farms , although it is probably unlikely that the sheep would be returning to such large number of farms.

whilst we consider scenarios of diseases transmitted by cattle, sheep or pigs separately, we do not analyse the risk of an epidemic occurring based upon the type of primary outbreak farm . number of contacts a pig holding makes was shown to depend on the holding type in swedish  <cit>  and belgian  <cit>  industries. it may be that in scotland those livestock farms with greater number of contacts are breeding farms with high sanitary levels and biosecurity; this would decrease the risk of epidemic spread compared to our results. coupling the movement records investigated in this analysis with the results of british agricultural censuses would allow for an analysis of the risk owing to farm type, and this is an aim for future research.

in this analysis, the potential for spread of infection via livestock movement is evaluated as if any movement from the primary outbreak farm during its infectious period results in disease transmission to the recipient farm or market . in reality, the dynamics of the infection on the primary outbreak will determine what proportion of its livestock becomes infectious and how rapidly. this, in combination with how many and which animals are being moved off, will determine what proportion of movements from the primary outbreak will contain infectious animals. notably, in scotland during the study period, the mode of the number of sheep , cattle  and goats  per movement was  <dig> and the mode of the number of pigs per movement was  <dig> . however the exact distribution of the number of animals per movement varied between the species; the distribution was somewhat diffuse for pigs, but highly over-dispersed and right-skewed for sheep and cattle . therefore the results of our analysis provide upper bounds to the potential for infection to spread via movements in this farm population. for comparison, the field data suggest that during the pre-detection spread of fmd virus in great britain in  <dig> just over half of the livestock movements from infected holdings to other farms resulted in transmission  <cit> .

our analysis is based on datasets from the systems that collated records of livestock movements . a potential limitation is that, although the animal keepers  were legally required to report the movements, it is possible that an unknown fraction of actual movements was not reported  <cit> . in addition, only around 90% of records of single movements of individual cattle from the cts database were usable. hence we may slightly under-quantify the numbers of livestock movements and the numbers of farms to which the animals were moved, and the upper bound of the risk of infection spread may be slightly higher than that suggested by our results.

the mean euclidian distances cattle can travel during the first generation of an epidemic with a 2-week infectious period in scotland at peak movement seasons are from  <dig> km to  <dig> km . these are slightly larger compared to the average for great britain in 2001- <dig>  <cit> , and in  <dig>  <cit> , and sizably larger compared to median distance of cattle movements in the netherlands in 2002- <dig>  <cit> , or mean or median distances of movements of cattle and sheep in new zealand  <cit> . the mean distance of pig movements during a 2-week epidemic's first generation in scotland can be between  <dig> km and  <dig> km. these are similar to the distances pigs are moved in sweden  <cit> , but are larger than the  <dig> km median distance of pig movements between farms in belgium  <cit> . hence there may be an opportunity for a larger geographical spread of a livestock infection prior to the detection of the outbreak in scotland, compared to the livestock industries in continental europe.

further comparison of our observations to other parts of europe highlights the similarities and differences in the rates and seasonal patterns of livestock movements between european territories. the double annual peak in cattle movement prior to and after the summer observed here for scotland is also present in sweden and in italy  <cit> . however in italy, in contrast to scotland, cattle movements to markets increase from july to their annual maximum in october, and this post-summer peak is largely composed of cattle imports reared in other countries  <cit> . the median of  <dig> cattle per daily movement between two scottish farms is close to that in denmark, where it is  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ; occasional movements of large numbers of cattle between farms also occur in both countries. the mean of  <dig> cattle per daily movement between two farms in scotland is close to the  <dig>  to  <dig>  cattle per batch moving between farms in italy  <cit> . the size of scottish pig industry is small  compared to some other european territories, e.g. scandinavian, german or dutch pig industries. however, we find that the uniform pattern of pig movements off scottish farms throughout the year is similar to those reported in denmark  <cit>  and sweden  <cit> . on the other hand, the median of  <dig> pigs per daily movement between two scottish farms is fewer than that between two fattening holdings in denmark, where it is 130- <dig> animals  <cit> . the patterns of livestock movements in individual regions of europe are underlined by the conditions  and traditions of livestock farming and trading. nonetheless, the differences are likely to have implications for implementation of any common approaches to govern livestock movements to prevent or manage future epidemics. how these differences affect the potential for pre-detection spread of acute contagious livestock diseases via livestock movements can be quantified using analyses similar to those presented in this paper.

CONCLUSIONS
we introduce a framework for analysis of livestock movement data to assess the potential for onward transmission of an acute contagious livestock disease from the primary outbreak farm via animal movements. it is applied to the scottish farm networks, and the risk of epidemic take-off is assessed in this country-wide farm population in the absence of epidemic-associated restrictions on livestock movements. with an exotic disease in mind, this is the assessment of the potential for pre-detection spread of infection via movements. this complements information provided by methods for projecting the final epidemic size from the features of the farm network  <cit>  or from the transmission potential of infection  <cit> , which are only relevant once the epidemic has taken off.
