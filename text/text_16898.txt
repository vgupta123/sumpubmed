BACKGROUND
bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  is a gammaherpesvirus of the genus rhadinovirus, and has been isolated both in healthy animals and in animals with variable diseases, from ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, respiratory diseases and abortion . the pathogenic role of bohv- <dig> remains unclear, even if there is increasing evidence of a secondary pathogenic role in bovine post-partum metritis . the coding capacity of bohv- <dig> has been described as well as the common and unique features of the bohv- <dig> genome in comparison to those of other gammaherpesviruses. however many of bohv- <dig> genes and their products have not been functionally characterized  <cit> .

bohv- <dig> gene expression cascade is similar to that of other herpesviruses and comprises immediate early , early  and late  gene expression  <cit> . herpesvirus ie genes are experimentally defined as those which are transcribed when cells are infected in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, because ie gene expression does not require de novo viral protein synthesis. under this conditions, rna transcribed from ie genes usually accumulates to higher levels than in absence of inhibitors, presumably because of the lack of feed-back inhibition. two major bohv-4ie rnas were characterized early during infection in the presence of cycloheximide, ie <dig> and ie <dig>  <cit> . although both of them have been well characterized in terms of gene structure, transcription and rna post-transcriptional processing  <cit> , the only one to be functionally characterized was ie <dig>  <cit> . the generation of viral mutants targeting the ie <dig> locus within the bohv- <dig> genome, provided the direct demonstration that bohv- <dig> gene product, orf50/rta, is indispensable in initiating and allowing progression of bohv- <dig> lytic replication  <cit> . in fact a recombinant bohv- <dig> in which orf50/rta was deleted was completely unable to replicate, but was efficiently rescued, with respect to production of infectious virus and dna replication, upon the expression of orf50/rta in trans  <cit> . whereas as regards bohv-4ie <dig> gene, it is the most abundant viral rna transcribed in the presence of cycloheximide, though its abundance is greatly reduced in absence of inhibitor, suggesting a down regulation by newly synthesized viral proteins  <cit> . since bohv-4ie <dig> rna is the major rna found under ie conditions, it was referred to it as the major ie rna  <cit> . ie <dig> is a spliced,  <dig>  kb rna, containing four exons and transcribed from the right to the left of bohv- <dig> genome. ie <dig> open reading frame  codes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids  with a predicted molecular weight of 33 kda and an unknown function  <cit> . therefore, the purpose of the present work was to knock-down bohv-4ie <dig> gene in bohv- <dig> genome cloned as a bac, to reveal its potential contribution in initiating and maintaining bohv- <dig> lytic replication.

RESULTS
generation of a bohv-4ie <dig> deleted mutant
although bohv-4ie <dig> is simultaneously expressed along with ie <dig> during bohv- <dig> life cycle and ie <dig> has a pivotal role in initiating the bohv- <dig> transcriptional replication  <cit> , it was of interest to know if ie <dig> could have an essential role similarly to that observed for ie <dig>  the main way to achieve this kind of information was to knock-down ie <dig> gene coding regions by heat inducible homologous recombination into the genome of bohv- <dig> cloned as bacterial artificial chromosome. a targeting fragment, ie1l-kanagalk-ie1r, containing the  <dig> base-pairs  kanagalk double selecting cassette  <cit>  flanked by two bohv-4ie <dig> gene homologous sequences, was introduced between the bohv- <dig> genome position  <dig>  and  <dig> . this insertion, comprising the full deletion of the ie <dig> third exon and most of the fourth exon, resulted with the elimination of the 70 % of the ie <dig> coding regions. many genes of bohv- <dig> genome are overlapped and the coding region of a gene can also works as a regulatory region for the neighboring gene. this ie <dig> gene knock-down strategy allowed maintaining intact the bo <dig> and bo <dig> gene promoter, thus preserving their transcription and translation . therefore, the viral phenotype obtained from this insertion/deletion was exclusively due to bohv-4ie <dig> knock-down and not contaminated by the loss of expression of the flanking genes, in this specific case bo <dig> and bo <dig> . to generate bohv- <dig> with knocked-down ie <dig> gene, bohv-4Δie <dig>  linearized pie1l-kanagalk-ie1r was electroporated in sw <dig> e. coli containing pbac-bohv- <dig> genome and pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> was generated. the authenticity of the selected targeted clones were checked by psti restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed by southern hybridization by a specific probe . further, pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> clone stability in sw  <dig> e. coli, before to attempt the reconstitution of the ie <dig> deleted virus, was assessed by serial passages  and psti digestion. pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> was stable as observed by the absence of differences among the restriction profile of pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> derived from different passages .fig.  <dig> generation of bohv-4-Δie <dig>  a schematic representation  of the overall strategy to knock-down ie <dig> gene in bohv- <dig> genome clone in sw  <dig> e. coli. bo <dig> , bo <dig>  and bo <dig>  gene coding regions are indicated by numbers, which represent nucleotide positions within the bohv- <dig> genome . the targeting fragment , ie1l-kanagalk-ie1r, flanked by two homologous sequences allowed the insertion of the double selectable marker kanagalk between the positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , deleting most of the ie <dig> coding region but leaving intact the bo <dig> and bo <dig> promoters. ie <dig> locus possess two psti sites, one at the position  <dig>  and one at the position  <dig> , generating a fragment of 7800 bp. after targeting, a new psti site, delivered by the targeted vector, was introduced into the ie <dig> locus and thus generating three psti restriction sites and two psti digestion product, of  <dig> and 5251 bp respectively. psti restriction enzyme digestion allowed to distinguish between targeted and untargeted clones , in fact the targeted clones  display two new bands  respect to the untargeted control clone . this is further confirmed by southern blotting with a specific probe for kanagalk . c clonal stability of pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> in sw  <dig> e. coli at passage  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and analyzed by psti restriction digestion



bohv-4Δie <dig> has an impaired replication
herpesvirus gene expression cascade and replication is mainly governed by the immediate early gene expression. the competence of the viral dna genome to reconstitute infectious replicating viral particles, irvps, can be tested by transfecting the mutant viral genome in permissive cell lines and this is greatly facilitated if the viral genome, as is the case of bohv- <dig>  is cloned as a bac. as a first approach to test the characteristics of the viral phenotype obtained from ie <dig> knock-down, a viral reconstitution assay was employed. bek cells and bekcre cells, constitutively expressing cre recombinase  <cit>  to excise out the floxed bac cassette from the viral genome, were electroporated with pbac-bohv- <dig>  pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> and pbac-bohv-4Δtk, a mutant bohv- <dig> genome in which the 2232 bp kanagalk double selectable marker was inserted into the bohv- <dig> thymidine kinase  gene  without interfering with the replication property of the resulting virus. surprisingly, all three genomes could efficiently reconstitute irvps  and this was the first consisting indication that ie <dig> is not an essential gene contrarily to what it was observed for bohv-4ie <dig> and gb knock-down, which gave a complete replicating uncompetent phenotype  <cit> . although the viral reconstitution assay is very informative from the qualitative point of view, on the other hand it is poorly quantitative. thus the replication kinetics of bohv-4Δie <dig> and bohv- <dig> obtained from pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> and pbac-bohv- <dig> bekcre transfected cells were compared. a slower replication, of ~ <dig> log, for bohv-4Δie <dig> respect to bohv- <dig> was observed . although ie genes are the first genes to be transcribed during the infection, their function can be protracted for the entire viral replication cycle. bohv- <dig> is a gammaherpesvirus with a slow replication cycle respect to alpha and beta herpesvirus and this is the reason why we see differences during the late infection. this data was corroborated by the reduction of the plaque size generated by bohv-4Δie <dig> respect to bohv- <dig> .fig.  <dig> characterization of bohv-4-Δie <dig>  a representative images  of bek and bek expressing cre  electroporated with pbac-bohv- <dig> and pbac-bohv-4Δie <dig> dna. cpe induced by reconstitution of irvps is recognizable for all three bac viral genomes . the test was repeated three times always giving identical results. b replication kinetics of bohv-4Δie <dig>  and bohv- <dig> . c representative images  showing plaque morphology and relative plaque sizes of bohv- <dig> and bohv-4Δie <dig> on vero cells. d the plaque sizes  were measured using the axio-vision40-v <dig> . <dig>   software program. bars represent means ± standard errors of  <dig> plaques for each virus . significance was measured by anova



bohv-4-Δie <dig> impaired replication can be rescued by ie <dig> expressed in trans
to confirm that the impaired replication, despite of small entity  but significant, observed for bohv-4Δie <dig>  was due to the loss of ie <dig> and not a mere artifact, bek cells constitutively expressing ie <dig> were generated to rescue in trans the loss of ie <dig>  ie <dig> orf cdna was obtained by pcr with an antisense primer containing a restriction site, a kozak’s sequence and matching the first eight codons comprising the atg, and a sense primer matching the last eight codons, including the stop codon, end ending with a restriction site . so generated ie <dig> orf cdna was sub cloned in a bicistronic expression vector provided of the cmv promoter, an internal ribosomal entry site  and a selectable marker  . pcmv-ie1-ires-neo was electroporated in bek cells and cells selected with g <dig> to get bek/ie <dig> cells. next, bohv-4Δie <dig> and bohv- <dig> replication kinetics were compared on bek/ie <dig> cells. as hoped, and showed in fig. 3b, the gap of replication between bohv-4Δie <dig> and bohv- <dig> was filled by expressing ie <dig> in trans. although a revertant strain could be generated, however it was reasoned that a revertant strain is not so much different from a wild type and for this reason it was preferred the expression in trans of the mutated gene.table  <dig> list of primers used in that work

bohv-4ie <dig> is not a tethering counteracting factor
despite bohv-4ie <dig> gene deletion gave a mild phenotype that could be rescued by bohv-4ie <dig> gene expression in trans, the real function of bohv-4ie <dig> gene, in the contest of viral replication, remained elusive. however from in silico study it was noticed that bohv-4ie <dig> shares a conserved amino-terminal domain with the k5/k3-family gamma- <dig> herpesvirus plant homeo domain /leukemia associated protein -finger type  <cit> . in a proteomics screen for new host targets of kshv k <dig>  it was observed that bone marrow stromal cell antigen  <dig> , an interferon-induced protein with the unique ability to restrict the egress of some enveloped viruses  <cit> , was counteracted in terms of viral egress restriction activity in the presence of k <dig>  <cit> . more recently, it was demonstrated that, similar to other k <dig> targets, bst- <dig> is ubiquitinated by k <dig>  resulting in ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal destruction  <cit> . starting from these information the potential bohv-4ie <dig> counteracting properties toward bst- <dig> were investigated. for this purpose a cell line, bek-bobst- <dig>  over expressing bovine bst- <dig>  was generated by stably transfecting bek cells with a bicistronic construct, pcmv-bobst-2-ires-neo, delivering a flag tagged bobst- <dig> orf . g <dig> selected bek-bobst- <dig> cells stably overexpressed bobst- <dig>  as shown by western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against the flag tag . the over-expression of bobst- <dig> in bek cells and the deletion of ie <dig> in bohv- <dig> genome should amplify the bohv-4Δie <dig> phenotype, in terms of restriction release of bohv-4Δie <dig> irvps into the infected bek-bobst- <dig> cells supernatant, if bohv-4ie <dig> was a real bst- <dig> counteracting factor. therefore, the replication kinetics of bohv-4Δie <dig> and bohv- <dig> were compared on bek-bobst- <dig>  bek/ie <dig> and bek cells. however no significant viral titer decrease at  <dig> hs post infection for bohv-4Δie <dig> infected bek-bobst- <dig> cells supernatant respect to that of bohv- <dig> infected bek-bobst- <dig> cells supernatant  was detected. this  <dig> log viral titer difference remained equal to that revealed for bohv-4Δie <dig> and bohv- <dig> infected bek cells supernatants . moreover, noteworthy a paradoxical significant increase of the viral titer, at  <dig> hs post infection, for bohv-4Δie <dig> infected bek-bobst- <dig> cells supernatant respect to the supernatant of bohv-4Δie <dig> infected bek cells  was observed. although this last data was not further investigated, it could be assumed a role different than a bst- <dig> counteraction factor for bohv-4ie <dig> gene product. on the other hand the similarities observed in silico between k <dig> and bohv-4ie <dig> were very mild and limited to the amino-terminal portion of the proteins . this could justify the lack of functional similarity in terms of bst- <dig> counteracting activity observed for ie <dig> and represents a classical demonstration that the in silico prediction should be always experimentally verified before to draw any conclusion.fig.  <dig> bohv-4ie <dig> is not a tethering counteracting factor. a schematic diagram  of the bicistronic construct pcmv-bobst-2-ires-neo containing the cmv promoter , the flag tagged bobst- <dig>  orf, an internal ribosomal entry site , the neo orf  and a polyadenilation signal . b western immunoblotting of bek cells stably transfected with pcmv-bobst-2-ires-neo  and selected with g <dig>  the lanes were loaded with different amounts of total protein cell extract . negative control was established with empty vector transfected cells . c replication kinetics of bohv-4Δie <dig>  and bohv- <dig>  on bek-bobst- <dig> cells. d replication kinetics of bohv-4Δie <dig> made on bek cells  and compared to that made on bek-bobst- <dig> cells 



CONCLUSIONS
bohv- <dig> has been suggested as a vector for gene delivery . several molecular and biological characteristics for this virus include: absence of oncogenicity, ability to accommodate large amounts of foreign genetic material, ability to be maintained in an episomal state in dividing cells and capability to infect several cellular types derived from different animal species. although the genome of bohv- <dig> has been sequenced completely  <cit>  the functional importance of most of the genes remains unknown. targeting genes and regions of gene expression regulation and the phenotypic analysis of the bohv- <dig> mutants represents a powerful tool to study the direct and indirect interactions of genes and genomic elements in a biological context. the classification of equivalent phenotypes carrying different types of mutations will provide insight into functional networks and their constituting elements. fewer than 75– <dig> orfs have been characterized in bohv- <dig>  based on amino acids homology and genome location and most of the genes have no apparent homology to known viral or cellular genes. essential genes are of particular importance and the inactivation of at least one of them is required to create replication-incompetent herpesvirus vectors for vaccination or gene therapy, while non-essential genes can be removed to gain space for insertion of therapeutic genes or generate attenuated vaccines, as it the case of ie <dig> investigated in the present work. therefore, these data are extremely valuable when virus genomes, such as bohv- <dig>  are modified for vector purposes.
