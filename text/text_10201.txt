BACKGROUND
the introduction of the heptavalent polysaccharide capsule vaccine  in north america as a pediatric universal vaccine program has led to a significant decrease in vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease   <cit>  and drug-resistant pneumococci. however, reports of the vaccine's success have been tempered by observed increase in the prevalence of non-vaccine serotypes  and in particular the multi-drug resistant  nvs 19a  <cit> . multi-locus sequence typing  of these isolates has demonstrated expansion of certain clonal complexes . the genetic determinants that are driving the success of certain cc remain poorly defined. several plausible and possibly overlapping hypotheses have been suggested. the first suggests that mdr 19a is a result of a genetic recombination event resulting in "capsule switch"  <cit> , thereby giving it a fitness advantage over other vaccine serotypes by not being subjected to immune selective pressure. second, mdr 19a existed before the implementation of pcv <dig> and has simply replaced vaccine serotypes  targeted by pcv <dig>  <cit> . third, mdr 19a has attained conserved genetic markers which confer resistance to antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of streptococcus pneumoniae  invasive pneumococcal disease   <cit> . these genetic markers are missing in the drug susceptible spn 19a isolates, such as those belonging to sequence type  <dig>  chief amongst these antibiotics conferred resistance to, are β-lactams and macrolides. resistance to these drugs likely confers a fitness advantage to the organism at the population level where antibiotics are commonly dispensed  <cit> . of note, high-level penicillin resistance has been mainly associated with serotypes 6a, 6b, 9v,  <dig>  19a, 19f, and 23f  <cit> . successful expansion of mdr 19a spn in the post-pcv <dig> introduction era poses a serious global public health risk. the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  was approved mid- <dig> for use in children in canada  <cit> . by early  <dig>  all provinces and territories in canada had instituted this vaccine into their routine vaccination programs. we describe here the results of comparative genomics of the emerging multidrug resistant serotype 19a identified from  <dig> years of spn serotype and susceptibility testing surveillance in relation to pcv <dig> introduction in canada.

RESULTS
serotype surveillance and susceptibility testing of mdr spn in the canadian bacterial surveillance network  1993-2008
serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility testing were determined for n =  <dig>  isolates over a  <dig> year period. serotype surveillance demonstrated a reduction in vaccine serotypes from the era immediately prior to pcv <dig> introduction in canada , pcv <dig> introduction era , and post-pcv <dig> introduction era  . we focus here on the mdr serotypes. figure  <dig> graphically depicts the trends in mdr  serotypes 6b, 23f, 19f and 19a, the major contributors to mdr spn in this population as a percent of all mdr isolates collected for that year. while other serotypes contribute to mdr, their numbers were not significantly large in our database.

multi-locus sequence typing  of mdr 19a spn isolates
due to the rising absolute number of mdr 19a isolates, mlst was performed to establish the genetic background of these strains. figure  <dig> demonstrates that sequence type   <dig>  part of cc <dig>  accounts for the majority of mdr 19a following the introduction of pcv <dig>  in canada. prior to pcv <dig> introduction, st <dig> was most significantly associated with serotype 19f in this study . st <dig> is a single-locus variant  of taiwan 19f- <dig>  which spread globally in the pre-pcv <dig> era  <cit> . categorical clustering of mdr 19a based on mlst demonstrated that st <dig> was associated with high-level penicillin resistance  . in contrast, non-mdr 19a control isolates taken from cbsn were associated with different sts . pre-pcv <dig> mdr 19f high-level penicillin resistance was also strongly associated with st <dig> in our canadian database . table  <dig> to  <dig> summarize actual mic values for individual mdr 19a isolates by st. mic values for penicillin , ceftriaxone , amoxicillin , erythromycin , and ciprofloxacin  are generally higher for st <dig> when compared to other sts amongst mdr 19a. although not statistically significant, the most notable trends among these antibiotics were penicillin and amoxicillin where st <dig> was high-level resistant, while other sts amongst mdr 19a were less resistant or susceptible. additional file 1http://www.pillailab.com/suppdata/index.html shows eburst results and summary statistics for all mlst carried out in this study. novel mlst are detailed in additional file 2http://www.pillailab.com/suppdata/index.html.

analysis of antibiotic resistance alleles by dna sequencing
mutations associated with elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations  have been described for key antibiotics commonly used to treat both invasive and non-invasive spn infection  <cit> . dna sequence analysis for key resistance-conferring residues in penicillin binding proteins  2x, 1a, and 2b showed conservation between mdr 19a , mdr 19f , and mdr 19a from us and korea . however, residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  of pbp2x were unique to a representative mdr 19a in the us and have been associated with high-level ceftriaxone resistance not seen in canadian isolates  <cit> . susceptible 19a isolates lacked mutations at key residues in pbp genes which are associated with β lactam resistance  <cit> . similarly, mdr 19a and 19f had complete conservation at residues of ermb, mefa, mef e and tetm  associated with resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines  <cit> . identical mutations in tn <dig> were also observed for representative us and korea mdr 19a isolates. genome insertion points of tn <dig> were heterogeneous amongst mdr 19a and 19f based on polymerase chain reaction  using primers derived from whole genome sequencing. additional file 3http://www.pillailab.com/suppdata/index.html provides the data set for all drug resistance gene sequences and tn <dig> insertion site confirmation results by pcr.

serotype , sequence type , clonal complex  and mic values  for penicillin , ceftriaxone  and amoxicillin  are indicated. residues associated with resistance to β lactams are in bold letters. ceftriaxone mic values for south korea isolates were unavailable. of note, taiwan 19f- <dig>   retains residues similar to 19f and 19a in this study at certain residues of pbp1a and pbp2x. for the complete data set, including tn2010-related resistance genes, see additional file  <dig> 

whole genome sequence of mdr 19a st <dig> from the post-pcv <dig> introduction era
a representative isolate of spn mdr 19a st <dig>  from the period immediately after universal coverage of pcv <dig> was identified for whole genome sequencing . figure  <dig> summarizes the whole genome and each locus can be navigated in additional file 4http://www.pillailab.com/suppdata/index.html. mdr 19f st <dig> from the pre-pcv <dig> introduction era  was also sequenced using the same method. sequence comparison of 19f and 19a st <dig> genomes, sequenced and identified  <dig> % difference in at content and  <dig> % difference in gc content for an overall shared identity of  <dig> % between the two genomes. no evidence of large insertions and deletions between the two genomes was identified.

capsule locus sequencing analysis
dna sequence comparison was carried out for the capsule locus. figure  <dig> depicts the arrangement of genes flanking the capsule locus which are similar to previously published data with some notable exceptions  <cit> . for example, a  <dig> base pair  region encoding the abc co-transporter of the vex operon was present adjacent to the capsule locus in post-pcv <dig> mdr 19a st <dig> but not in mdr 19f. the vex operon in its entirety was located outside of the capsule locus for mdr 19f. the vex gene has homology to abc co-transporters and has been linked to vancomycin tolerance in spn  <cit> . of note, β lactam resistance genes pbp2x and pbp1a were adjacent to the capsule locus and, as summarized in table  <dig>  harboured key mutations that confer resistance to β lactam drugs. alignment of pbp1a and pbp2x gene sequences from representative st <dig> mdr 19a , st <dig> mdr 19f , and st <dig> 19a  demonstrated one recombination point located within pbp2x and the other identified by genome walking distal to pbp1a . in contrast to pbp2x where homologous and heterologous snps occur, pbp1a showed perfect conservation between recipient and donor strains.

discussion
serotype surveillance of mdr strains in the cbsn database confirmed what other countries have observed - specifically the increased prevalence of mdr 19a, with a concomitant decline in mdr serotypes included in the pcv <dig> . mlst analysis of mdr 19a was able to identify st <dig> as the dominant emerging genotype. this was in contrast to previous studies  <cit>  which demonstrated clonal expansion of an existing st <dig> mdr 19a after pcv <dig> introduction but in agreement with other groups  <cit> . st <dig> appears to have higher than usual resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone based on mic values and is challenging to treat clinically especially in the case of bacterial meningitis  <cit> . this may explain in part st <dig> expansion under drug selection pressure. the same genotype and phenotype were present in mdr 19f in the pre-vaccine era - the major contributor to st <dig> prior to pcv <dig> introduction in our study. this was not surprising as 19f st <dig> is a single locus variant of taiwan 19f- <dig> which spread globally in the pre-pcv <dig> era  <cit> . it was logical then to test the hypothesis that mdr 19a st <dig> emerged from pre-existing mdr 19f st <dig>  to lend credence to this hypothesis, it was noted early on that pcv <dig> had differential immunological responses to vs, perhaps allowing certain mdr vs  to survive and co-circulate with non-vs  during pcv <dig> introduction in canada  <cit> . "capsule switch" has been described previously in spn and would be the simplest genetic event to account for a 19f to 19a change  <cit> .

brueggemann and colleagues carried out partial dna sequencing at the capsule locus and demonstrated that recombination points likely lay distal to pbp1a and pbp2x based on sequence divergence between putative donor, recipient, and progeny strains  <cit> . this was an important demonstration of capsule switch from vaccine serotype  <dig>  to non-vaccine serotype 19a  in the post-pcv <dig> era  <cit> . a similar comparison of pbp1a and pbp2x adjacent to the capsule locus from st  <dig> 19a , st  <dig> mdr 19a , and 19f  was undertaken in our study. these data demonstrate definitively that a homologous recombination event has occurred between donor and recipient with breakpoint within pbp2x and flanking pbp1a, again reinforcing the fact that capsule switch can occur between vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes thereby allowing "vaccine escape". this is a well documented strategy that spn employs to enhance its fitness  <cit> . of interest is the presence of the coding sequence of the vex operon  associated with vancomycin tolerance adjacent to the capsule locus of 19a but located in its entirety outside of this region in 19f. while all strains in this study had an mic of ≤  <dig>  μg/ml to vancomycin , it is possible that the dysregulation of vex, an abc-like transporter, by uncoupling it from the rest of the operon, could lead to vancomycin mic creep. further evaluation of vancomycin mic is required to determine the significance of this gene and its location within the capsule amongst mdr strains, especially as vancomycin remains the last line of defense against invasive gram positive infection  <cit> .

in order to dissect the genome further, we undertook wgs comparing a representative isolate of st <dig> mdr 19a and 19f. in keeping with the mlst data, near identity  was observed with  <dig>   shared snps, when compared to a reference strain r <dig>  between mdr 19a and 19f st <dig>  of note, mdr 19a was genetically closer  to mdr 19f in this study than another serotype 19a from hungary present in genbank . these data reinforce that genetic relatedness is better indicated by mlst rather than serotype. of the  <dig> unique snps identified in mdr 19a, some were in drug resistance markers, virulence factors, cell signaling, and key metabolic genes. of these,  <dig> snps were non-synonymous. the presence of unique, non-synonymous snps inmdr 19a st <dig> suggest that unique polymorphisms may also contribute to its success in the post-pcv <dig> era. the presence of mutations in metabolic genes raises the possibility of increased intrinsic fitness. however, we did not observe significant difference in growth kinetics between various sts associated with mdr 19a in liquid culture experiments .

south korea uniquely reported pre-pcv <dig> mdr 19a st <dig>  it remains unclear why mdr 19a would emerge without vaccine selection pressure against mdr 19f st <dig>  canadian mdr 19a st <dig> isolates used in this study were identical at key drug resistance markers to both us and korean representative isolates suggesting a common source. there was, however, marked heterogeneity of transposon tn <dig> insertion sites within a geographic locale suggesting spn undergoes rapid modification by this mode of genetic change. furthermore, us isolates had unique mutations which confer high-level resistance to ceftriaxone and have been associated with other st. taken together, this suggests that mdr 19a emergence has been caused by distinct genetic events in different geographic locales rather than global spread of a single clone.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provides evidence that mdr 19a st <dig> is genetically derived from mdr 19f st <dig> - based on mlst, conservation of snps across the genome, key drug resistance markers, and capsule locus structure. however, unique snps and heterogeneous transposition events also existed in mdr 19a st <dig>  suggesting that this strain has adapted and mutated away from a 19f progenitor and is under continuous selection pressure. mlst appears to be limited in explaining the genetic origins of a particular strain as it focuses only on seven housekeeping genes. we confirm that pcv <dig> vaccine selection pressure, antibiotic selection pressure, and spn's propensity for genetic change appear to have created a "perfect storm" for mdr 19a emergence. emergence of genetically heterogeneous mdr 19a appears to be occurring simultaneously in different geographic locales due to similar selection pressures.

capsule switch events likely occur through genetic transformation in the nasopharynx of children co-infected with different st of spn. of great concern to clinicians is that mdr 19a remains difficult to treat especially in the case of bacterial meningitis where few therapeutic options exist to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid. if as with methicillin resistance staphylococcus aureus  vancomycin creep occurs , newer antimicrobial agents will be needed. furthermore, alternative vaccine strategies that target all serotypes of spn  may be prudent in light of this organism's genetic lability and propensity for vaccine escape. a new 13-valent capsular polysaccharide vaccine  is slated for introduction and does include serotype 19a and may forestall its spread. studies in the developing world are also required to fully understand the extent of the emergence of this strain.
