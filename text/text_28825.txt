BACKGROUND
alternative pre-messenger rna splicing involves the differential use of splice sites, a process that represents a powerful and versatile way to control protein function. it is estimated that greater than 70% of the human genes may be alternatively spliced  <cit> . striking examples highlighting the importance of alternative splicing are found in many systems including programmed cell death or apoptosis. deregulation of apoptosis is often caused by alterations in the alternative splicing of regulatory genes including cell surface receptors such as fas; mediators such as bcl- <dig>  bcl-x and bax; and members of the family of caspase proteases  <cit> . bcl-x is alternatively spliced to produce bcl-xl and bcl-xs, two proteins with antagonistic function in apoptosis  <cit> . in cancers and cancer cell lines, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl is increased and overexpression of bcl-xl is associated with decreased apoptosis, increased risk of metastasis, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and poor clinical outcome  <cit> . in contrast, the pro-apoptotic isoform bcl-xs can sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> .

given the pivotal role that alternative splicing plays in the diversification of protein function, strategies capable of specifically reprogramming alternative splicing should improve our ability to address the function of individual isoforms, and will provide tools to alter or correct aberrant splicing decisions in clinically relevant genes. approaches that target alternative splicing can therefore be used to modulate the expression of protein isoforms with distinct activities. the annealing of oligonucleotides directly complementary to splice site sequences has been used to modulate splicing decisions of different pre-mrnas including tau, dystrophin and the apoptotic regulator bcl-x . for example, oligonucleotides complementary to the 5' splice site of bcl-xl can shift splicing toward the pro-apoptotic bcl-xs isoform, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> . moreover, intraperitoneal injections of such oligonucleotides in mice can produce significant changes in the splicing of a target gene in several organs  <cit> . more recently, this strategy was used to prevent the use of cryptic splice sites in mutated lamin a transcripts responsible for hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome  <cit> . however, directly targeting a 5' splice site can potentially create problems of specificity because 5' splice site sequences conform to a consensus. thus, an oligonucleotide complementary to a selected 5' splice site may hybridize to off-target 5' splice sites, a situation that may compromise its effectiveness and blur the interpretation of the phenotype.

with the goal of improving the specificity and potency of oligonucleotide-based splicing inhibition, we have developed a strategy that relies on the use of an oligonucleotide complementary to exon sequences located immediately upstream of the target 5' splice site. the oligonucleotide also carries a non-hybridizing tail that contains binding sites for the hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins  <cit> . the protein binding portion of the tail prevents u <dig> snrnp binding to the target 5' splice site and/or compromises spliceosome assembly. in extracts and in cells, this design inhibits splicing at the intended site more efficiently than an oligonucleotide directly targeting the 5' splice site, possibly because of reduced hybridization to secondary sites. such bifunctional oligonucleotides are effective at nanomolar concentrations in cells, and are therefore unlikely to alter the availability of hnrnp a/b proteins which exist in micromolar amounts in actively dividing cells. thus, positioning hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins in the vicinity of a splice site using tailed oligonucleotides may be more specific and can be more effective than other antisense approaches.

although hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins are expressed in the nucleus of actively growing mammalian cells, their abundance and cellular localization vary greatly in different mouse and human cell types  <cit> . in the present study, we have analyzed whether bifunctional oligonucleotides carrying a tail harboring splicing signals can interfere with the alternative splicing of the bcl-x pre-mrna in vitro. we report that a branch site can promote splicing interference when it is part of a 5' or a 3' tail. moreover, a branched, y-shaped, 3' tail also interferes with splicing. the interfering activity of a branched tail can be further improved by including splicing signals in the arms of the branch.

RESULTS
splicing interference by 5' tails in bifunctional oligonucleotides
we have shown previously that a bifunctional oligonucleotide with a 5' overhang that contains binding sites for the hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins strongly inhibits splicing when the oligonucleotide hybridizes immediately upstream of the 5' splice site of bcl-xl . this block increases the production of the alternative bcl-xs mrna isoform  <cit> . tails made up of poly sequences or containing a purine-rich sequence bound by sr proteins elicited no significant splicing interference. to investigate whether different overhangs could be active, we first tested an oligonucleotide carrying a  <dig> nt-long tail that contains the sequence of the β-globin branch site  . a mammalian branch site sequence is recognized initially by the sf <dig> protein and ultimately by the u <dig> snrnp during spliceosome assembly  <cit> . rna oligonucleotides were incubated for  <dig> hours in a hela nuclear extract containing a model ~ <dig> kb-long human bcl-x pre-mrna transcript that contains the 5' splice sites of bcl-xs and bcl-xl . total rna was isolated and a rt-pcr assay was performed to measure the ratio of the bcl-xs and bcl-xl amplified products. as observed previously, oligonucleotide m <dig>  which is complementary to positions - <dig> to - <dig> upstream of the bcl-xl donor site but lacks a tail, did not interfere significantly with bcl-x splicing at any of the concentrations tested . in contrast, oligonucleotide m4a <dig>  which contains a tail with high-affinity binding sites for the a1/a <dig> proteins, shifted splicing towards bcl-xs with an ic <dig> of ~ <dig>  nm . this concentration represents a ~10-fold excess of oligonucleotides relative to the bcl-x pre-mrna. the m4a1m oligonucleotide which contains mutations in the a <dig> binding sites  behaved essentially as the tail-less m <dig> oligomer . two oligonucleotides containing different control tails of random origins  also lacked significant activity even at the highest concentration tested . the oligonucleotide carrying the β-globin branch site sequence as a 5' overhang  displayed inhibitory activity, but only at the highest concentration tested . based on this and other experiments , the ic <dig> for the m4b <dig> oligonucleotide was estimated to be in the range of  <dig> nm. we conclude that while the presence of a tail is not by itself sufficient to elicit splicing interference, a 5' tail containing a branch site can be interfering. its lower efficiency compared to a tail carrying binding sites for hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins may be a characteristic of the tail or may be due to differences in the stability of the oligos. to obtain some assessment of stability, we individually incubated 5' end-labeled oligonucleotides with a similarly labeled control oligonucleotide  for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes in a hela extract under splicing conditions. following incubation, the mixtures were fractionated on gels and the oligonucleotides were quantitated to obtain a stability index for each oligonucleotide. although 5' end dephosphorylation without degradation will lead to an overestimation of the instability of the oligonucleotides, the assay nevertheless allows the establishment of apparent stability indices that may be useful to a first approximation. based on this assay , we conclude that m4a <dig> and m4a1m display comparable stabilities. m4b <dig> and m4bc <dig> also have similar stabilities but are less stable than m4a <dig>  a situation that may explain why m4b <dig> is less efficient than m4a <dig>  in contrast, the control m4jv <dig> appears as the least stable oligonucleotide.

a 3' tail also displays interfering activity
an oligonucleotide carrying a 5' tail bound by hnrnp a1/a <dig> interferes with splicing in two ways: first, it reduces u <dig> snrnp binding to the 5' splice site, and second, it interferes with later steps of spliceosome assembly  <cit> . because a spliceosome occupies ~ <dig> nt on either side of the 5' splice junction  <cit> , we asked whether a tail emerging  <dig> nt upstream of the 5' splice junction would be interfering. thus, we compared the interfering activity of m4b <dig> with that of an oligonucleotide carrying the β-globin branch site sequence as part of a 3' tail . as can be seen in fig. 2b, the interfering activity of m4b <dig> was approximately  <dig> times inferior to that of m4b <dig> , despite the fact that the m4b <dig> appears more stable than m4b <dig> . thus, a branch site tail positioned at the 3' end of a bifunctional oligonucleotide is not as active as a similar tail located at the 5' end.

to try to improve the interfering activity of the 3' tail, we generated oligonucleotide m4b3+, which contains a 5' splice site next to the branch site sequence in the tail of oligonucleotide m4b <dig> . the interfering activity of m4b3+ was now indistinguishable from that of m4b <dig> . it is possible that this 7-fold improvement in activity is in part due to the superior stability of the m4b3+ oligo . u <dig> snrnp binding to the oligonucleotide may provide protection against nucleases. the shift obtained with m4b3+ requires that the tail be linked to the m <dig> portion of the oligonucleotide since adding a free tail  to the splicing mixture did not inhibit bcl-xl mrna production .

activity of branched 3' tails
next, we wished to assess whether splicing interference could be improved by using an oligonucleotide that contains a y-shaped branched structure as part of the 3' tail. a non-hybridizing branched oligonucleotide can inhibit splicing when added at high concentration  to a nuclear extract  <cit> , suggesting that the branched structure is bound by splicing factors. a low concentration of a bifunctional oligonucleotide carrying such a branched structure may elicit specific splicing inhibition if positioned near a 5' splice site. oligonucleotide m4-25e contains three identical  <dig> nt-long segments of the sequence aaugucugcu. one repeat is linked to the others via a 2'-5' bond . the  <dig> nt repeat sequence displays no significant interfering activity when present in a regular 5' tail . notably, incubation of m4-25e promoted a shift toward bcl-xs production with an ic <dig> of ~ <dig> nm , a value comparable to the  <dig> nm obtained with m4b <dig> and m4b3+ . the m4-25e and m4b3+ oligos being of similar stability , this result suggests that a branched tail provides steric hindrance, possibly by interacting with a branch-specific factor. the inclusion of a branch site sequence at the base of the branched tail  improved splicing interference . note that this oligonucleotide also contains slightly longer 3' arms but the sequence in the arm is inactive . the interfering activity of a branched tail was further improved by including a β-globin 5' splice site in the 3' arms of the branch . with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm, the interference level of m4-25d was even slightly superior to that of the 5' tailed oligonucleotide carrying a1/a <dig> binding sites . however, the m4-25c and m4-25d oligos have stability indices 3- to 4-times superior to that of m4a <dig> , thereby preventing us to attribute equivalent efficiency based on the design alone. an oligonucleotide with a branched tail carrying both the branch site and the 5' splice site sequences  was slightly less active than m4-25d but affected splicing in a manner equivalent to the branched oligonucleotide carrying the branch site alone . because m4-55a was less stable than m4-25c and m4-25d , the combined presence of both branch site and 5' splice site sequence appears to provide some additional efficacy.

role of u <dig> snrnp in the activity of a 5' splice site tail
we have shown that bifunctional oligos with tails containing branch site or 5' splice site sequences display inhibitory activity when positioned near the bcl-xl 5' splice site. we wished to ascertain the contribution of u <dig> and u <dig> snrnp binding in the respective activity of the branch site and 5' splice site tails. however, this evaluation is complicated by the fact that u <dig> and u <dig> are essential splicing factors. thus, inactivating or depleting u <dig> or u <dig> snrnp should block splicing, preventing an assessment of its importance for the activity of the tails. to circumvent this problem, we have tested various concentrations of 2'-o-me rna complementary to the 5' end of u <dig> or u <dig> snrna to inactivate u <dig> or u <dig> snrnps  <cit> . then, we selected a concentration of anti-u <dig> oligo that had a limited impact on the splicing efficiency of the bcl-x pre-mrna, as measured by a conventional splicing assay. although the selected concentration of the anti-u <dig> oligo did not affect splicing efficiency, it improved the relative use of the 5' splice site of bcl-xs such that the xl/xs ratio changed from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . next, we asked whether the activity of the interfering tails was affected when the u <dig> snrnp was targeted in this manner. notably, the interfering activity of the bifunctional oligo carrying two 5' splice sites in a branched tail  was compromised when we used the extract treated with the 2'-o-me rna against the 5' end of u <dig> snrna. as shown in figure  <dig>  in the mock-treated extract, the m4-25d oligo shifted the xl/xs ratio from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  . in contrast, the xl/xs ratio in the u1-compromised extract went from  <dig>  in the control mixture to  <dig>  and  <dig>  when supplemented with  <dig>  or  <dig> nm of m4-25d oligo, respectively . thus, m4-25d almost completely eliminated the production of bcl-xl lariat products in the mock-treated extract whereas it only had a minor effect in the u1-compromised extract. this result is consistent with the view that the 5' splice site carrying tail of m4-25d is acting by recruiting u <dig> snrnp. in contrast, similarly targeting u <dig> snrnp did not affect the activity of a branch site-containing tail . this may be because the remaining amount of u <dig> snrnp is sufficient for the activity of the tail or that another factor is responsible for the activity of the branch site tail.

discussion
the current study demonstrates that bifunctional oligonucleotides carrying a variety of tails can efficiently reprogram 5' splice site selection on a model bcl-x pre-mrna in vitro. a tailed oligonucleotide provides interaction sites for factors that upon binding will sterically antagonize splice site recognition and/or spliceosome assembly. our previous work demonstrated that an oligonucleotide carrying a 5' overhang bound by hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins and a portion complementary to the sequence immediately upstream of the bcl-xl 5' splice site compromised the splicing to the bcl-xl site and improved splicing to the upstream bcl-xs 5' splice site in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . here, we report that a 5' tail containing a branch site sequence also provides significant interference. it is not clear why the branch site-containing oligonucleotide is less active than the a1/a2-bound oligonucleotide. the oligonucleotide may fold in a way that reduces its hybridization to the target site or compromises the binding of factors to the branch site sequence. alternatively, the binding of splicing factors may be less efficient or less obstructive than when the tail is recruiting hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins. finally, the lower stability of the branch site oligonucleotide may also contribute to this difference with the oligonucleotide containing a1/a <dig> binding sites.

a branch site sequence presented in a 3' tail was considerably less active than when part of a 5' tail, suggesting that the interfering potential of the tail decreases when its distance relative to the 5' splice site of bcl-xl increases. alternatively, the branch site factor may bind less efficiently in this configuration. in addition, we have observed that a 3' tail containing a y-shaped branched structure can interfere with splicing. branched structures carrying 2'-5' linkage are recognized by factors that promote debranching  <cit> . gel-shift assays indicated that the branched tail of oligonucleotide m4-25e was stably bound by nuclear factors, whereas no stable binding was observed with the individual arms of the branched tail . although the identity of the factor that binds to the branch in these assays remains unknown, our results indicate that positioning a branch  <dig> nt upstream of a 5' splice site represents a strong impediment to splicing. finally, a stronger splicing interference was obtained when the branched tail included a β-globin branch site or 5' splice site. thus, combining a branched core with spliceosomal factor recognition elements such as a branch site or a 5' splice site improved splicing inhibition. a branched oligonucleotide with a 5' splice site sequence in each of the 3' extensions was the most efficient branched oligomer tested with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm.

our results clearly demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides containing sterically interfering overhangs can modulate 5' splice site selection. in addition to a 5' tail carrying binding sites for hnrnp a1/a <dig>  tails of completely different configurations worked efficiently, thereby providing flexibility in the choice of an interfering tail. the hnrnp a <dig> and a <dig> proteins are expressed in the majority of transformed cells but are not abundantly expressed in many normal human tissues  <cit> . thus, tails with binding sites for constitutively expressed factors  may be more suitable if the intention is to reprogram splicing in normal cells.

interfering oligonucleotides are active at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro. we have shown that interfering bifunctional 2'-o-me oligonucleotides are also active in vivo at concentrations below  <dig> nm  <cit> . such high potency makes them attractive alternatives to current rnai approaches which use short double-stranded rnas that, in some instances, can elicit an unwanted interferon response  <cit> . an additional advantage relative to rnai-based approaches is that bifunctional oligomers can be used to repress the production of one isoform while simultaneously increasing the production of another isoform. this may be desirable when the purpose of the intervention is to alter the ratio of spliced isoforms displaying different, sometimes antagonistic activities, as is the case with the apoptotic regulator bcl-x.

different strategies using tailed oligomers have recently been described as means of reprogramming alternative splicing decisions. using a tail carrying binding sites for sr proteins, skordis and collaborators have shown that such a tail can recapitulate the activity of an exon enhancer element by stimulating the inclusion of exon  <dig> of smn <dig> in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . likewise, pna-peptide oligomers carrying  <dig> to  <dig> arginine-serine residues stimulated the in vitro inclusion of two weak exons   <cit> . in contrast to the two preceding strategies, our approach relies on using a tail to elicit splicing inhibition. it is possible that in all cases, the hybridization of the oligonucleotide to exon sequences may also repress mrna translation, a situation that would antagonize the impact of a splicing enhancing tail, but would further contribute towards abrogating the expression of a specific splice isoform when a splicing inhibitory tail is used. for the moment however, an increase in the arsenal of strategies that can reprogram splicing provides greater flexibility in the choice of approaches to alter splicing decisions in genes that affect human diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
alternative pre-mrna splicing is relevant to a large variety of human diseases including cancer. as a means of reprogramming splice site selection, we have used bifunctional oligos that hybridize to exon sequences and contain a tail designed to interfere with the use of a nearby 5' splice site. we have tested the activity of different tail architectures and found that tails containing a branched structure, a branch site or a 5' splice site bound by u <dig> snrnp can reprogram in vitro splicing at low nanomolar concentrations. thus, a variety of tail structures bound by different factors may be used to reprogram 5' splice site selection.
