BACKGROUND
desert ecosystems currently cover about 35% of the earth's land surface  <cit> . additionally, water deficiency has become a worldwide problem. this desertification in arid and semi-arid regions, as well as water deficiency, have been become a focus of attention internationally  <cit> . it is urgent that stress-related genes and their upstream regulatory mechanism, together with stress-resistant species be studied extensively.

calcium is known for its crucial role as a second messenger in mediating multiple defence responses under various environmental stress stimuli  <cit> . primary calcium sensor calcineurin b-like protein  which was identified as a calcium binding protein was recently isolated in higher plants  <cit> . recent studies indicate that the cbl protein is not only an integrative node responding to stress stimulus, but also an upstream regulator of stress gene expression in plants  <cit> . overexpression of cbl could confer several stress tolerance  <cit> .

in the cbl gene family, cbl <dig> can be induced by various stress signals, such as wounding, cold, drought and high salinity  <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of this gene in arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt, but reduced tolerance to freezing  <cit> . we observed that overexpression of the cbl <dig> gene enhanced tolerance to both drought and cold  in a. mongolicus. we predicted that this kind of expression difference might be caused by the upstream regulatory effect.

although the cbl <dig> gene is an important point in the calcium signal transduction pathway, little is known about its regulatory mechanism. moreover, recent studies on cbl <dig> have focused on arabidopsis, instead of on other species with stronger stress tolerance. a. mongolicus is the only super-xerophytic evergreen broadleaf shrub species growing in the desert region of northwest china. it has extremely strong tolerance to drought, cold, heat, solar radiation stress and poor site qualities  <cit> , and can survive a winter temperatures less than -30Â°c  <cit> . up to now, studies on a. mongolicus have mainly focused on antifreeze proteins, genetic diversity, spatial heterogeneity of soil and the cold-induced amcip gene  <cit> . dissecting the upstream regulatory part of the a. mongolicus cbl <dig> gene should contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of calcium signal cascades in a calcium sensor relay. a stress-inducible promoter of cbl <dig> is also a good resource for transgenic engineering.

in this study, the1683-bp 5'-flanking region of amcbl <dig> promoter was isolated and analysed, and an intron was found in the 5'-utr region. we also investigated the role of this promoter region, with regard to its tissue-specific expression pattern and relative expression activities, using transgenic analyses in tobacco . in addition, we demonstrated the shortest promoter region sufficient for tissue-specific expression and the stress-induced expression activity.

RESULTS
isolation of amcbl <dig> promoter
we isolated the amcbl <dig> promoter with the detailed amplification procedure shown in table  <dig>  since the sequence of the first exon of amcbl <dig> gene was only  <dig> bp in length, it was difficult to design three gene-specific primers based on it. for extending the primer designing space, we cloned the first intron of the amcbl <dig> gene using primers int1/int <dig> designed on the first and second exon of the amcbl <dig> gene. then chromosome walking was employed for promoter cloning. then one 850-bp sequence was obtained after the longest strip was sequenced. using the same method, primers gsp <dig>  gsp <dig>  gsp <dig>  gsp <dig>  gsp <dig>  and gsp <dig> were designed to walk further on the basis of the newly sequenced fragment, and sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> bp were obtained separately. a 1683-bp 5' flanking region was finally obtained . a putative 'tata' box motif 'tatatata' was found  <dig> bp upstream of the initiation codon atg of the amcbl <dig> open reading frame. the sequence upstream of the transcription start, located at  <dig> , is the whole promoter region all primer sequences are in table  <dig> 

multiple environmental-related and hormone-related cis-elements were predicted on amcbl <dig> promoter sequence
using place and plantcare databases, we analysed the sequence of amcbl <dig> and atcbl <dig> promoters, and predicted their key cis-acting elements and the location of these elements. thus, amcbl <dig> promoter was shown to harbour multiple stress cis-acting elements . eight homologue sequences of the pathogenesis- and salt-related cis-acting element gt1gmscam <dig> were found there. one homologue sequence of cpbcspor, which is a specific binding site of cytokinin-dependent protein  <cit> , was discovered. two homologue sequences of gareat, which is abundant upstream of ga-induced genes in arabidopsis  <cit> , were examined. three homologue sequences of wboxatnpr <dig> were also detected. two homologue sequences of wboxhviso <dig> which mainly participates in the sugar signal transduction  <cit>  were found. in addition, light-responsive elements were found, such as i-box, gt <dig> and gatabox. only one homologue sequence of abreratcal element was discovered. abreratcal is a calcium responsive cis-element that exists in  <dig> unregulated genes  <cit> . we also found that two ct/ga-rich motifs existed near the tata-box of the amcbl <dig> promoter.

since a stress-inducible promoter in other xerophytic plants has never been reported in spite of extensive research in arabidopsis, we compared the amcbl <dig> promoter with the atcbl <dig> and atrd29a promoters, respectively, using database analysis. the result showed that the cis-acting elements predicted were nearly identical with each other, despite their low homology . however, the number of cis-elements predicted differed. the above database analysis showed that most elements existing in amcbl <dig> promoter were mainly environment- or hormone-responsive motifs. we therefore predicted that amcbl <dig> promoter would be an inducible promoter and regulated by multiple abiotic factors and hormones. we conjectured that expression of the amcbl <dig> gene under normal conditions might be higher than of the atcbl <dig> gene, possibly due to the adaptation mechanisms of this xerophytic plant to abiotic stresses. it is interesting that a 690-bp intron was found on 5'-utr of the amcbl <dig> promoter,  <dig> bp away from the initiator atg of the amcbl <dig> gene, by blasting sequences of amcbl <dig> promoter and the untranslated 5'-region  of amcbl <dig> cdna  .

all the five promoter deletion segments were sufficient to drive gus expression in transient expression
to study the contribution of different regions of the amcbl <dig> promoter to its expression activity, we first performed a comparative transgenic analysis of five different promoter-gus fusion constructs . all of them were separately transferred into tobacco  cv.  <dig> and a. mongolicus by agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. our result revealed all the five promoter deletion segments were sufficient to drive gus expression by transient expression both in a. mongolicus and tobacco . a discrepancy of gus expression pattern between a. mongolicus and tobacco lied with the exact expression locus. gus staining was detected in the main leaf veins in tobacco, whereas blue points were observed only in leaf margins of a. mongolicus. this might have resulted from the different leaf properties of the two plants. tobacco leaves are very thin, making gene transfer easier, while a. mongolicus has fleshy leaves that could prevent transformation.

regeneration of transgenic tobacco plants
to further identify the functional regions of the amcbl <dig> promoter, a series of chimeric gus genes containing 5'-deletion derivatives of the 1683-bp amcbl <dig> promoter  were separately transferred intotobaccocv. <dig> by agrobacterium-mediated leaf-disc transformation. transgenic tobacco lines were obtained, belonging to six groups . three independent kanamycin-resistant pcr-positive  single-copy  transgenic tobacco plants from each of group were chosen for further analysis. the detailed experimental procedure is described in materials and methods.

histochemical analysis of gus activities in transgenic tobacco seedlings
to identify the expression profiles of transgenic plants driven by the five amcbl <dig> promoter deletion segments and the camv35s promoter, the independent transgenic plants were subjected to histochemical stains as described in materials and methods. the expression profiles of all five transgenic amcbl <dig> promoter constructs are shown in figure.  <dig>  gus expression was detected in transgenic seedlings of s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  b1s <dig>  b2s <dig>  35s and wild type tobaccos using one-week-old etiolated seedlings. the camv35s promoter was expressed in all tobacco tissues, and no gus activity was detected in wild-type tobacco; however, gus staining was detected in leaf veins, stems and roots of plants containing the full-length promoter construct s <dig>  and deletion promoter constructs s <dig>  s <dig> and b1s <dig>  no gus expression was detected in the longest deletion construct b2s <dig>  in addition, gus expression activity for s <dig> was the strongest among the five amcbl <dig> promoter constructs examined; s <dig> and s <dig> had similar expression patterns to each other. only detectable blue points were examined in b1s <dig>  and deletion of the  <dig> bp from the region of b1s <dig> resulted in no gus activity in transgenic plants. this implies that the amcbl <dig> promoter was tissue-specific and that the promoter deletion segment b1s <dig> was sufficient to drive gene expression, and also that the 129-bp deleted-fragment might contain some cis-acting elements.

gus expression localisation of amcbl <dig> promoter segments
a gus staining experiment by razorblade section was used to further investigate the exact location of gus gene expression. since the constructs s <dig> and s <dig> had similar expression activity, and construct b2s <dig> had no gus activity, we chose s <dig>  s <dig> and b1s <dig> for further experiments. transgenic plants driven by the camv35s promoter, and wild-type tobacco, were the respective positive and negative controls. blue points were detected in vascular bundles, mesophyll and cortex of leaves; vascular bundles, pith and cortex of stems; and vascular bundles, tips and caps of roots of transgenic tobacco driven by the camv35s promoter . no gus staining was observed in tissues of wild-type tobacco. for transgenic tobacco driven by promoter segments s <dig>  s <dig> and b1s <dig>  there was gus staining only in vascular bundles, especially phloem of leaf veins, stems, and roots. it is interesting that gus expression was only detected in the meristematic zone of root tips, and no blue staining was observed in root caps . we conjecture that the amcbl <dig> promoter was a vascular-specific and particularly a phloem-specific promoter. moreover, the full-length promoter construct s <dig> still showed the strongest gus expression activity of the three amcbl <dig> promoter constructs examined. since there was a sharp decrease in gus staining in the distal segment b1s <dig>  when the intron was deleted from s <dig> 3'-end, we suggest that the promoter expression strength was mainly determined by this 5'-utr intron. this also suggests that this 5'-utr intron might contain certain enhancer-like elements necessary for promoter activity.

fluorometric analysis of gus activities in transgenic tobacco
the expression quantity of different amcbl <dig> promoter segments in different transgenic tobacco tissues  under normal conditions are shown in figure.  <dig>  the gus-specific signal was very high in roots and stems, while leaf samples showed only visible gus activities. there was a gradual decrease in gus activities upon deletion of the amcbl <dig> promoter. the full-length promoter segment s <dig> had the highest gus activity of the three promoter constructs; however, it was still lower than the positive-construct camv35s promoter in roots, stems or leaves. results of the gus assay on intron-less promoter segment b1s <dig> showed that removing the 690-bp intron significantly affected quantitative behaviour; gus activity decreased sharply with intron deletion.

there were significant differences among leaf, stem, and root. there were also significant differences among s <dig>  s <dig>  b1s <dig> and 35s in leaves. for stems and roots, there were significance differences in s <dig>  s <dig> and b1s <dig> . significant differences among s <dig>  s <dig> and b1s <dig> in leaves, stems or roots all support the above result that the 611-bp deletion segment and the 690-bp deletion 5'-utr intron might contain an enhancer-like cis-element. the fluorescence quantification data correlated with the histochemical staining results. together with the gus staining results, we demonstrated that the 611-bp deletion sequence and the 5'-utr intron were required for both tissue specificity and quantitative behaviour. moreover, the 5'-utr might play a role as an enhancer-like expression module.

effects of stresses on gene expression of amcbl <dig> promoter segments in tobacco seedlings
abiotic stresses are known to regulate amcbl <dig> gene expression . moreover, database analysis predicted the existence of abiotic-stress-responsive elements. to investigate the subtle impact of abiotic stresses on gene expression of amcbl <dig> promoter segments in tobacco, the fluorometric assay for gus activity was also used in this experiment. there was a distinct gene expression profile for each of the three amcbl <dig> promoter segments . although each of the three promoter segments responded to drought, cold, wounding, salt and cacl <dig> treatments, respectively, there was no measurable gus reporter enzyme increase for s <dig>  s <dig> and b1s <dig> with salt treatment; and for s <dig> and b1s <dig> with cold treatment in roots. in addition, similarly to the full-length promoter, promoter activities of s <dig> and b1s <dig> could be greatly enhanced by application of cacl <dig>  cold, wounding or salt. however, for drought stress treatment, enhancement was not obvious despite a slight increase of gus activities .

thus, we conclude that the amcbl <dig> promoter segment positively responded to drought, cold, wounding, salt and cacl <dig>  and that the amcbl <dig> promoter full-length segment had the strongest induction pattern. since the roots of deletion segments s <dig> and b1s <dig> did not respond to cold, whereas the full-length promoter did, this might result from the absence of cold-related cis-acting elements causing sequence deletion. we suggest that cold-related cis-elements may be required for response to cold in roots outside the region contained in the b1s <dig> construct. we also conclude that the absence of salt-related cis-elements in the amcbl <dig> promoter, which regulate gene expression in root from the result of three promoter segment, did not respond to salt treatment in roots.

effects of plant hormones on gene expression of amcbl <dig> promoter segments in tobacco seedlings
when several major plant hormones were applied to three-week-old seedlings grown under light, distinct gene expression profiles were found for each of the three amcbl <dig> promoter segments . gus expression responded differently in these treated seedlings . among the three promoter segments, only the full-length promoter s <dig> significantly responded to exogenous aba induction in leaves, and also in stems and roots. it is interesting that the full-length promoter segment positively responded to aba induction, while no positive response was detected in roots of the promoter deletion segment under aba treatment. this implied that an aba-related cis-acting element required for response to aba in roots might exist outside the region of the b1s <dig> construct. exposure of these transgenic seedlings to ga and sa failed to induce gus activities in roots of the three constructs. moreover, sa induction resulted in no increase in gus activity in stems of transgenic plants s <dig> and b1s <dig>  we suggest that the amcbl <dig> promoter did not contain sa- and ga-related cis-elements that regulate gene expression in root, and that the deletion sequence might contain a sa-related cis-acting element that regulated gene expression in stems. in addition, the amcbl <dig> promoter full-length segment had the strongest induction pattern compared to other promoter deletion segments.

discussion
genes can be expressed in most plant tissues during most phases of growth and development with constitutive promoters such as camv35s, taking advantage of limiting temporal and spatial regulation which is suitable for proof-of-concept experiments. however, the presence of transferred genes driven by constitutive promoters may result in homology-dependent gene silencing, particularly when the promoter is also highly active  <cit> . vascular-specific promoters and inducible-promoters are highly organised sequences of events that require the correct spatial and temporal expression of specific sets of genes leading to the development of a primary vascular network  <cit> . the unique advantages of these promoters derived from plant genes make them a potentially powerful tool for improving plant resistance to abiotic stresses, offering an interesting alternative to costly and environmentally harmful chemical control. hence, tissue-specific and inducible promoters are preferred as experimental tools to analyse the effects of transgenic expression and produce transgenic plants with resistance to diverse abiotic stresses. however, few shuttle promoters have been described up to now. in this respect, the amcbl <dig> promoter possesses interesting and original properties of possible practical value in biotechnological applications, especially for economically valuable dicotyledons.

a typical promoter contains a tata-box and a caat-box. the function of a tata-box is mainly the precise initiation of transcription. the caat-box is frequently focused on controlling transcription initiation  <cit> . a typical promoter also harbours some special dna sequences; cis-acting elements inhibiting or activating gene transcription by combining with the transcription factor. in our experiment, place and plantcare database analysis of the promoter sequence of amcbl <dig> and atcbl <dig> genes showed that the amcbl <dig>  atcbl <dig> and atrd29a promoters harboured multiple-stress cis-acting elements . it is interesting that the cis-acting elements predicted in the amcbl <dig> and atcbl <dig> promoters were nearly identical, despite their low homology of  <dig> %. our study of sequence analysis failed to find comparable sequences to the amcbl <dig> promoter in other promoters from other stress-resistant desert plants; it is most likely that studies on other desert plant promoters were not adequate to allow such detection.

it has been reported the drought-induced element dre  usually exists upstream of these drought-induced gene promoters, while the aba-induced gene promoter usual harbours an abre   <cit> . however, other genes  contain neither dre nor abre elements, even if they can be induced by drought and aba. this kind of gene expression has been reported as regulated by myb and myc recognition motifs  <cit> . amcbl <dig> could be induced by drought, salt and aba , and we found some homologous sequences which could be recognised by myb and myc elements and one homologous sequence of the abre element. it is conjectured that amcbl <dig> possibly has a specific regulatory system distinct from both rd22a and aba-induced gene promoters, i.e. the transcription factors myb, myc and abre rather than dreb played a key role in upstream expression regulation of the amcbl <dig> promoter.

sequence blasting of the amcbl <dig> promoter and the 5'-untranslated region of amcbl <dig> cdna showed that a 690-bp intron existed upstream of the 5'-end,  <dig> bp away from the initiator atg of the amcbl <dig> gene. blasting the 5'-flanking region of atcbl <dig> with its 5'-untranslated region identified a 411-bp intron upstream of the 5'-end,  <dig> bp away from the initiator, which was similar to the result for a. mongolicus. introns have also been discovered on genes atcbl1- <dig> and atcbl <dig> in the arabidopsis cbl gene-family  <cit> . it is interesting that introns were found on the 5'-end of both the amcbl <dig> and atcbl <dig> promoters. genome-wide analysis in arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the degree to which an individual intron matches the promoter-proximal intron profile is a strong predictor of its ability to increase expression. sequences responsible for elevating expression are dispersed throughout an enhancing intron  <cit> . in many cases, introns have a larger influence than promoters in determining the level and pattern of expression  <cit> . function of this 690-bp intron, i.e. whether it plays a role as an enhancer or if it alters tissue-specific expression, is of interest to us.

in this study, we performed gus-assay experiments and detected sharp decreases in leaf, stem and roots by the deletion of the 5'-utr intron, compared with gus activities detected in s <dig>  however, deletion by removing 611-bp from the 5'-end of the full-length amcbl <dig> promoter under normal conditions without any stress induction, was comparable to reported intron-mediated transcription enhancement in transgenic rice cells  <cit>  and mammal cells  <cit> . previous studies in plants failed to detect the requirement of introns for the establishment of a c4-specific expression pattern of the ppca <dig> gene <cit> , most likely because the regulatory mechanism between desert plants and crops differ. in addition, no stain was detected when  <dig> bp was deleted from the b1s <dig> 3'-end, indicating that some positive-regulatory element might exist there. overall, our results experimentally demonstrated for the first time that there were cis-acting elements located in the 611-bp promoter deletion sequence and that an enhancer-like sequence existed in the proximal intron in a desert plant.

razorblade sections indicated that the amcbl <dig> promoter was a phloem-specific promoter. gus activity of amcbl <dig> promoter segments were strictly localised in phloem of the promoter deletion segments of transformed tobacco with differing staining strengths. it is interesting that gus activity did not occur in xylem but only in phloem, so long as the cambium was formed. moreover, root sections showed that staining was not only in the vascular bundle but also in the root tip meristematic zone. it was also interesting that gus staining did not occur in root cap, which differed to results for the camv35s promoter. the mechanism behind this phenomenon is still unclear. it is predicted that this tissue-specific alteration contributed to evolution of desert plants. hehn identified a highly conserved motif 'ataagaacgaatc' involved in the phloem strength and specificity was  <cit> . other vascular-specific promoters from rice, milk vetch dwarf virus  <cit>  and pumpkin pp <dig> gene promoter  <cit>  also contained this conserved sequence. in all these promoters, this motif was upstream of the tata box  <cit> . consistent with this notion, a similar motif  was also found  <dig> bp upstream from the tata box in the amcbl <dig> promoter. consequently, this confirmed that the motif 'ataagaacgaatc' and its homologue sequences determined the promoters' phloem-specific expression pattern.

cis-acting regulatory elements are important molecular switches involved in the transcriptional regulation of dynamic networks of gene activities controlling various biological processes, including abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and developmental processes. the ever-improving accuracy of transcriptome expression-profiling has led to the identification of various combinations of cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of stress-inducible genes involved in stress and hormone responses  <cit> . here, we discuss major cis-acting elements that are vital parts of gene expression in stress and hormone responses elements by fluorometric analysis of gus activity of amcbl <dig> promoter segments. the amcbl <dig> promoter segment positively responded to drought, cold, wounding, salt, cacl <dig>  aba, ga and sa. moreover, the amcbl <dig> promoter did not contain salt-, sa- and ga-related cis-elements which regulated gene expression in roots. it was also revealed that cold- and aba-related cis-elements in roots and sa-related cis-elements in stems might exist outside the region contained in the b1s <dig> construct. ma confirmed stress-related 5'-cis-elements on a genome-wide scale, and placed the stress response within the context of tissues and cell lineages in the arabidopsis root  <cit> ; evolutionary pressures may have conferred distinct responses to different stresses in time and space. in this regard, our induction promoter amcbl <dig> has advantages over atcbl <dig> for molecular breeding of economically valuable to select superior plants for harsh environments.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we clarified that the cbl <dig> gene promoter from a. mongolicus is a vascular-specific promoter  by histochemical assay and razorblade section. further analysis of gus activity showed that the amcbl <dig> promoter could be induced by multiple abiotic stresses  as well as by plant hormones . drought and cold tolerance are especially advantageous to plant growth in harsh environments.

deletion mapping of the 5'-end and site-specific mutagenesis identified four regions of the promoter essential for expression under the five stress conditions and in response to three plant hormones. some sequence elements were important for response to all stress treatments, whereas others were stress-specific. we demonstrated that the b1s <dig> fragment was sufficient to confer the stress induction and tissue-specific developmental expression characteristics of the cbl <dig> gene promoter to a gus reporter gene.

fluorometric analysis of gus activity of the amcbl <dig> promoter segments  showed that the  <dig> and 690-bp introns and 129-bp sequence outside the b1s <dig> region harboured cis-acting elements. this resulted in significant decrease in expression level in transgenic tobacco, and the most critical region essential for expression of the amcbl <dig> promoter under all five environmental stresses and for the three plant hormones was located within the 5'-utr intron. it was further demonstrated that the intron on the 5'-utr played a key role in determining the promoter expression strength, which clearly indicated that this intron was involved in regulating expression levels. moreover, fluorometric analysis of gus activity of the amcbl <dig> promoter segments under five stress and three hormone treatments revealed that the amcbl <dig> promoter did not contain salt-, sa- and ga-related cis-elements, which regulated gene expression in roots. it was also revealed that cold- and aba-related cis-elements in roots, and sa-related cis-elements in stems, might exist outside the region contained in the b1s <dig> construct.

further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism behind the sharp decrease in expression activity caused by the 5'-utr intron deletion. that is to say, that both a deletion construct only covering the untranslated region of the promoter and a deletion construct without the utr should be included in further gus analysis. despite the poor understanding of action mechanisms, further studies will hasten transformation of economically important plants with the amcbl <dig> promoter construct fused with the calcium sensor cbl <dig>  which differentially regulates drought, salt and cold responses.
