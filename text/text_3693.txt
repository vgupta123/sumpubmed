BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic male sterility  is a widespread trait in flowering plants specified by novel, often chimeric genes in the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome  <cit> . the trait can be suppressed by nuclear restorer of fertility  genes that act to specifically down-regulate the expression of corresponding novel, cms-specifying, mitochondrial genes. the phenomenon of cms and nuclear fertility restoration is of commercial interest because it can be used for the production of higher yielding hybrid crop varieties. from an evolutionary standpoint, maternally inherited male sterility may spread in a population of hermaphroditic plants due to different selective factors acting on nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes  <cit> . the consequent increase in frequency of females in the population will reduce pollen production  <cit>  and create selective pressure for the appearance of a new nuclear restorer gene. in this sense, the phenomenon of cms and fertility restoration can be viewed as a conflict between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes analogous to the “gene for gene” concept for conflict between genomes of host plants and their pathogens, an “intragenomic arms race” that has apparently been occurring throughout much of angiosperm evolutionary history  <cit> .

most characterized nuclear restorer genes have been found to encode pentatricopeptide repeat  proteins. ppr proteins are characterized by tandem degenerate repeats of a  <dig> amino acid motif, and most are thought to function as sequence-specific rna binding proteins that modulate mitochondrial and chloroplast gene expression through post-transcriptional processes including editing, splicing and nuclease cleavage  <cit> . most sequenced eukaryotic genomes possess only a few ppr encoding genes, but in land plants this gene family is greatly expanded and in angiosperm species it can encompass between  <dig> and  <dig> members, many of which are plant-specific variant forms with ppr-related repeats that are both longer and shorter than the degenerate core  <dig> amino sequence  <cit> . in general nuclear, restorer genes have been found to specify prototype p-type ppr proteins - those with tandem repeats consisting exclusively of the  <dig> amino acid core motif  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the plant p-type ppr family indicates that restorer proteins are members of a distinct clade of “rf-like” or rfl proteins restricted to flowering plants  <cit> . the rfl proteins within a given species appear to be under positive selective pressures, consistent with the intragenomic arms race hypothesis  <cit> .

like the related tetratricopeptide repeat  and puf-domain proteins, the ppr domain, as initially proposed by small and peeters  <cit>  is configured as two anti-parallel alpha-helices, with successive ppr domains forming an extended superhelix surrounding a central groove that functions in rna binding  <cit> . recently, combinatorial code models have been proposed that correlate key amino acid residues within a given repeat with its rna binding properties  <cit> . such models can explain the rna binding specificity for some ppr proteins with known rna binding sites and are consistent with some aspects of the solved structure of a ppr protein with its bound rna ligand  <cit> . these models are not predictive of the binding sites for all ppr proteins and there have been few experimental investigations on the relationship between the structure of ppr proteins and their biological functions in vivo  <cit> .

the radish  nuclear restorer gene rfo  <cit>  is structurally identical to the radish rfk <dig> restorer  <cit>  of the related radish kosena cms and restores fertility to brassica napus plants carrying the ogu-inra form of the ogura or ogu cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> . the rfo protein has been shown to be localized to mitochondria and to bind the target mrna of the ogu cms-associated gene, orf <dig>  <cit> . transgenic introduction of a single copy of rfo into ogu-inra cms plants is sufficient to completely restore male fertility  <cit> . rfo is flanked in the radish genome by two other potential ppr-encoding sequences, g <dig> and g <dig>  <cit>  corresponding to ppr-a and ppr-c, respectively, of desloire et al.  <cit> a. the premise that ppr-c encoded a protein comparable in size to rfo and ppr-a was based on the existence of a predicted intron that could not be verified by transcript analysis and it is therefore likely that this sequence is a pseudogene. both the ppr-a and ppr-c genes are highly similar to rfo, but each has a deletion that removes  <dig> amino acids from one of the ppr domains and both display a complete inability to restore fertility to ogu-inra cms plants. although it is likely that ppr-c is a pseudogene, ppr-a is expressed, though at a lower level than rfo  <cit> .

we have used the transgenic restoration of male fertility as a convenient means of assessing the biological function of variant forms of rfo, and thereby probing primary structure-function relationships in this important category of plant proteins. we show here that significant primary structural perturbation of the rfo protein completely eliminates its capacity to restore male sterility. importantly, we have found that introduction into the rfo protein of the four amino acid deletion found in ppr-a and ppr-c and a non-restoring radish allele of rfo leads to a partial loss of restoration function that correlates with a partial loss of the capacity to suppress expression of the ogu cms-associated protein orf <dig>  the degree of male-fertility varies in such plants in a manner dependent upon the copy number of the introduced transgene. the study indicates that transgenic introduction of rfo or its variants into ogu-inra cms b. napus plants provides a sensitive means of assessing ppr protein function that should facilitate dissection of primary structure-function relationships for this group of proteins.

RESULTS
rfo and ppr-a each contain  <dig> ppr motifs
the amino acid sequences of the rfo proteins predicted in several different publications  <cit>  are identical and identical to that for the protein predicted to be encoded by rfk <dig>  the nuclear restorer for a radish cms system related to ogura termed kosena or kos  <cit> . two groups  <cit> , however, identified  <dig> ppr domains in the protein, while the third  <cit>  reported an additional ppr domain located at the c-terminal side of the other domains. to clarify the number and location of ppr domains present in rfo and the related ppr-a protein sequence, these sequences were analyzed by tprpred  <cit> , a resource that has been specifically designed to detect tpr, ppr and sel1-like domains in protein sequences that may be missed by other methods.

as shown in figure  <dig>  tprpred detects  <dig> ppr and  <dig> domains in the rfo protein and ppr-a proteins, respectively . these domains include the  <dig> detected by desloire and co-authors  <cit>  as well as an additional domain closest to the n-terminus. tprpred predicts domains that are in the same register or “frame” as the pfam resource  <cit>  employed by koizuka et al.  <cit>  and brown et al.  <cit> . this register is shifted two amino acids towards the c-terminus from another widely employed ppr representation  <cit>  corresponding to the initially proposed domain definition  <cit> . thus residue  <dig> in the tprpred/pfam register corresponds to residue  <dig> in the latter register. more recently, a third representation of the ppr domain based on the solved 3-dimensional structure of a ppr protein was proposed  <cit> . in this representation the domains begin at residue  <dig> of desloire et al.  <cit>  and it is this register that is employed in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

ppr-a is missing four amino acids found in domain  <dig> of rfo, and has an additional stretch of  <dig> amino acids at its c-terminus that are not recognized as containing a ppr domain. it is interesting to note that the amino acids that have sustained the highest levels of replacement between rfo and ppr-a occur at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ppr domain. these residues are the same as those found to be subject to the highest levels of positive selection selective pressure  <cit>  and two  <cit>  or three  <cit>  have been proposed to play a role in the recognition of the rna ligand in combinatorial code models.

a non-restoring rfo allele possesses the same 12 bp deletion in domain  <dig> as ppr-a
the presence of the same 12 bp deletion in the nucleotide sequences encoding both ppr-a and ppr-c raised the question as to whether this same deletion might be present in non- restoring rfo radish alleles. we thus searched for rfo sequences in the f <dig> asian radish mapping population employed to clone rfo  <cit> , reasoning that such sequences would be found in sterile progeny but not in homozygous fertile progeny. during fine mapping studies of the rfo gene using arabidopsis-derived genetic markers, we noticed that nearly all the arabidopsis probes employed as rflp markers detected multiple, independently segregating genetic loci in the mapping population. this is consistent with the occurrence of genome duplication events in the brassiceae tribe, which includes the radish genus raphanus, subsequent to its divergence from the lineage leading to arabidopsis  <cit> , and has since been confirmed by detailed molecular mapping studies  <cit> . it was therefore essential that the potential rfo allele be identified as one that was clearly anchored at the rfo locus.

on the basis of this consideration, our approach to identifying the rfo allele in the sterile parent of this mapping population was to use the principle of bulked segregant analysis  <cit>  to target the region spanning the ppr-a deletion. we specifically targeted the region spanning the ppr-a deletion by analyzing expressed sequences using rfo-based primers to amplify transcript sequences from pooled rna preparations made from individuals that were male-sterile or male-fertile and homozygous for rfo-linked markers. as shown in figure  <dig>  one set of sequences was identified in this manner that had the same 12 nt deletion in comparison to rfo as the ppr-a coding sequence. in comparison to rfo, however, only three additional base substitutions were found in this sequence as opposed to  <dig> for ppr-a, and only one of these resulted in an amino acid substitution, as opposed to  <dig> for the ppr-a sequence. we therefore viewed the sequence as a likely allele of rfo and not an ortholog of the ppr-a gene.figure  <dig>

a 12 bp deletion in rfo domain  <dig> reduces but does not eliminate restorer function
we chose to further investigate structure-function relationships in between rfo and the related, non-restoring ppr proteins through directed mutagenesis experiments via consecutive pcr reactions  <cit> . our initial construct, designated rfoΔ, was designed to determine the effect on fertility restoration of removing from rfo the four amino acids that are missing from rfo domain  <dig> in ppr-a and the non-restoring rfo allele. approximately 30 t <dig> transgenic plants were recovered following its introduction into ogu cms plants. ogu cms flowers possess short filaments and anthers that remain closed and fail to shed pollen. in contrast, the recovered transgenic plants had longer stamens and anthers that opened and shed pollen . staining of the pollen of the rfoΔ transgenic plants, however, revealed that the proportion of viable pollen grains varied from plant to plant . at one extreme were plants, here exemplified by plant  <dig>  for which virtually all the grains stained green, characteristic of aborted, non-viable pollen  <cit> . other plants, such as plants  <dig> and  <dig>  showed a greater proportion of reddish-brown grains characteristic of viable pollen. assessment of pollen viability in this manner correlated with its capacity to form pollen tubes in the styles of ogu cms plants . as expected, pollen from the more fertile partially restored plants also gave rise to more viable seeds following pollination of the ogu cms line than did pollen from more sterile plants. unexpectedly, however, we noticed that siliques formed following fertilization with pollen from the more fertile partially restored plants contained a relatively high proportion of smaller, aborted seeds that were incapable of germination .figure  <dig>

the degree of male sterility among the different transgenic individuals was found to correlate with the number of bands observed in southern blot analysis using a probe consisting of the rfo promoter and coding region . plants for which a high proportion of the pollen grains were non-viable showed only a single hybridizing band, suggesting the presence of only a single inserted copy, whereas plants releasing a higher proportion of viable pollen showed multiple hybridizing bands. analysis of the pollen producing capacity of t <dig> plants generated by pollinating different t <dig> plants with the “westar” maintainer line supported the view that the variation in pollen viability was a result of transgene copy number differences . of the  <dig> plant  <dig> progeny,  <dig> had flowers that appeared phenotypically identical to ogu cms plants, consistent with the presence of only one or two independently segregating copies of the transgene in the parent t <dig> plant. in contrast, all  <dig> of the progeny of the more fertile plants  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> produced pollen, consistent with the presence of multiple copies of the gene in the parent t <dig> plants. of the  <dig> progeny plants of a fertile wtrfo analyzed, four were completely fertile, and one was completely sterile, consistent with the presence of only a single copy of the transgene. we conclude from these experiments that the deletion of the  <dig> amino acids from ppr domain  <dig> of rfo reduces but does not eliminate its function.

modifications of rfo structure and expression that eliminate restorer function
because of the high degree of variation observed among rf-like ppr proteins  <cit>  and the retention of partial rfo function in the deletion allele, we reasoned that the functional constraints on rfo and possibly other rf-like ppr proteins might be relaxed. to further investigate this possibility, several other mutant forms which represented hybrid sequences, constructed by replacing domains from rfo with their ppr-a counterparts, were introduced and expressed in ogu cms plants. these constructs are depicted in figure  <dig> and included sequences specifying a ppr-a protein in which the deletion carrying domain  <dig> was replaced with its rfo counterpart , a derivative of construct  <dig> in which the ppr-a domain  <dig>  c-terminal extension and 3’utr were replaced with the corresponding rfo domains  and a construct similar to construct  <dig>  in which the ppr-a domains 1- <dig> were replaced by the corresponding rfo domains . two additional constructs were investigated: in one, sequences encoding rfo domain  <dig> and the two c-terminal amino acids  were removed ; in the other, the rfo coding and 3’utr sequences were expressed using the ppr-a promoter .figure  <dig>

for all these constructs, the flowers of transgenic plants recovered after transformation into ogu-cms b. napus “westar” appeared identical to those of the non-transformed cms line and failed to produce pollen or set seed. analysis of mitochondria from the progeny of crosses between a limited number of these plants and the westar maintainer line with an anti-rfo  antibody  <cit> , an example of which is shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  indicated that proteins encoded by the introduced sequences are expressed. while it is perhaps not surprising that constructs in which a significant number of rfo domains were exchanged for their counterparts in ppr-a were not functional, the finding that removal of only the c-terminal ppr domain resulted in complete loss of function was unexpected. also of interest was the finding that expression of an intact rfo protein using the ppr-a promoter region also failed to restore any pollen production to cms plants. transgenic ppr-a protein is expressed from its native promoter at levels that are considerably lower than expression levels for transgenic rfo using its promoter  <cit> . thus, it seems likely that there needs to be at least a threshold level of rfo expression for fertility restoration, and that expression with the ppr-a promoter is not sufficient to achieve this level.

expression of the cms-associated orf <dig> protein in partially restored plants
the ogu cms is associated with expression of the novel mitochondrial gene orf <dig>  <cit> . the protein encoded by this gene, orf <dig>  is strongly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it forms an oligomeric complex  <cit> . the level of this protein is reduced upon fertility restoration, which is consistent with its serving as the causative factor in ogu cms  <cit> . the mechanism by which expression of this protein leads to cms is unclear, however. from this standpoint, it was of interest to determine to what extent the levels of this protein correlated with the degree of male sterility expressed in the different transgenic lines generated upon transformation with the rfo and rfoΔ constructs.

the relative level of expression of orf <dig> protein, as detected with anti-orf <dig> antiserum in immunoblots of mitochondrial protein from different organs of cms plants and plants expressing the wild type rfo transgene, is shown in figure 5a. in cms plants, slightly higher levels of orf <dig> expression are seen in the petals, anthers and style mitochondria than in the sepal and leaf mitochondria. orf <dig> levels in all these tissues are markedly reduced in plants expressing the rfo transgene, and the protein is barely detectable in mitochondria from sepals and leaves. figure 5b shows a comparison of the orf  <dig> levels in mitochondria from different rfoΔ plants expressing different degrees of male sterility. as expected, plant  <dig>  which produced the lowest amount of viable pollen, showed the highest level of orf  <dig> expression in all organs. immunolocalization of orf <dig> in the anthers of these plants indicated that it was expressed at highest levels in the tapetum as it is in cms plants. interestingly, among the plants with more intermediate levels of male sterility , there was little variation in the amount of orf <dig> expression, although some differences in the degree of male sterility in these plants could be observed .figure  <dig>

discussion
ppr domains and recessive alleles of rfo
because of the differences in the numbers of rfo ppr repeats recognized by the software applications employed by different research groups in previous analyses  <cit> , we re-analyzed the rfo and ppr-a sequences with tprpred  <cit> , an application developed after the initial publications on rfo that is designed to detect more divergent tpr, ppr and sel- <dig> solenoid repeat elements, and is capable of identifying more repeats, than applications previously used for this purpose, such as pfam  <cit> . this approach allowed us to identify  <dig> ppr repeats in rfo and  <dig> repeats in ppr-a, with the difference between the two proteins arising from the four amino acid deletion in the region of ppr-a that corresponds to domain  <dig> of rfo. the  <dig> repeats included the domain closest to the c-terminus that was identified by desloire et al.  <cit>  as well as an additional repeat immediately following the n-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. not surprisingly, the n- and c-terminal repeats had the highest of the reported p values of the tprpred prediction, indicating they were the most diverged from the test sequences on which the computational hidden markov model  is based. interestingly, the c terminal repeat  <dig> previously reported  <cit>  had a higher p value than the n-terminal repeat  <dig> and was not recognized as a ppr repeat in every tprpred run of the rfo sequence.

previously, two different recessive alleles of the rfo/rfk <dig> protein have been reported. koizuka et al  <cit>  found that the sterile asian radish line used to map the rfk <dig> gene  <cit>  contained an expressed sequence with  <dig> base substitutions in the coding region, four of which caused amino acid substitutions in the encoded protein. three of these occur in domain  <dig> and one in domain 3; the domain  <dig> substitution and one of the domain  <dig> substitutions occur at ppr residue  <dig>  which the combinatorial code models predict to be involved in ligand recognition  <cit> . more recently a second rfo allele, in this case occurring in a european radish cultivar was described  <cit> . the rfo locus in this allele possessed only two ppr protein coding sequences, ppr- <dig> and ppr- <dig>  which clustered more closely with ppr-a and ppr-c, respectively, than with rfo . both sequences were more highly diverged from rfo than rfk <dig>  we have now partially characterized a third rfo allele, in this case from an asian radish variety, that encodes a protein with the four amino deletion also found in in ppr-a and ppr-c as well as one of the domain  <dig> amino acid replacements occurring in rfk <dig>  this finding formed the initial basis for our further site directed mutagenesis study of the structural basis of rfo function.

directed mutagenesis of rfo
expression of the rfoΔ construct, in which the rfo sequence is missing the four amino acids of domain  <dig> that are deleted in ppr-a and the non-restoring rfo allele, led to only a partial loss of restoration capacity, as measured by several different criteria. the degree of fertility expressed in these transgenic plants also correlated well with the copy number of the introduced gene and with the degree to which expression of the cms-associated polypeptide, orf <dig> was reduced. it is noteworthy that none of the deleted amino acids correspond to key residues predicted to be involved in ligand recognition  <cit>  and secondary structure prediction indicated the motif carrying the deletion would still assume the form of the beta  - helical segment of the ppr motif. the solved structure of a ppr protein bound to an rna ligand shows that successive domains in the protein bind successive nucleotides in the rna  <cit>  and it has been suggested that the spacing of contiguous motifs in p-class ppr proteins may be important in limiting the length of contiguous nucleotides in the associated rna sequence  <cit> . from this perspective, the retention of some biological activity in the deleted mutant form of the protein might be unexpected, since removal of these amino acids would likely affect the distance between adjacent domains and thereby possibly reduce its affinity for the orf <dig> mrna ligand and disrupt its capacity for fertility restoration. although such disrupted spacing among repeats may reduce the affinity of rfo for its rna ligand, this does not evidently occur to the extent that biological function is completely abolished.

the degree of fertility of the different partially restored plants obtained with the rfoΔ construct also correlated with the number of viable seeds obtained following fertilization with the pollen produced by these plants. we also noted that a relatively high percentage of the seeds obtained using pollen from some of the plants were small and failed to germinate. this was unexpected, since the only known mode of action of rfo is to suppress expression of orf <dig> and orf <dig> expression has no known effect on embryogenesis and seed development. pollen development in ogu-inra b. napus arrests at the uninucleate stage and the mitosis that gives rise to the generative cell does not occur  <cit> . while it is possible that the deletion allele has some additional effect on embryo development that is related to the aborted seed effect, it may also be that some rfoΔ pollen may develop past the uninucleate stage but experience a defect in the second pollen mitosis that leads to the formation of two generative cells. this would result in grains with only a single generative cell or with two defective generative cells. fertilization events due to such pollen grains might then lead to defects in embryo and/or endosperm development. for example, pollen development in arabidopsis cdc2a mutants is blocked at the second mitotic division; these grains are capable of fertilizing the egg cell but not the polar nuclei of the embryo sac, and the zygotes thus formed arrest early in embryogenesis  <cit> .

in contrast to the phenotypes associated with the rfoΔ construct, the deletion of the c-terminal domain  <dig> resulted in an apparent complete loss of function, with no alteration in flower morphology or pollen production in comparison to the ogu cms recipient line. successive domains in ppr proteins bind successive residues in the rna ligand  <cit>  and conceivably this loss of function could reflect the importance of the binding of the terminal domain to forming a stable rna-protein interaction.

when transgenic ppr-a is driven by its own promoter, it can be detected with antiserum that has similar sensitivity towards ppr-a and rfo  <cit> . its level of expression, however, is considerably lower than for corresponding constructs in which rfo  is expressed off its promoter. the absence of any evidence of fertility restoration after introduction of the construct in which the rfo promoter was replaced by the ppr-a promoter suggests that some critical level of expression of the protein must be obtained to achieve any level of evident suppression of the cms phenotype. this might be the case if binding of rfo to orf <dig> mrna were cooperative, although no evidence of cooperative binding has been observed in binding analyses of other ppr proteins, such as ppr <dig>  <cit> . a more likely explanation is that small decreases in the level of orf <dig> expression have little or no effect on its disruption of pollen development and that more substantial suppression of its expression is required before significant amounts of pollen are released.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate here that directed mutagenesis of the rfo nuclear restorer gene for the ogu-inra cms of brassica napus provides an effective and convenient means of assessing the function of individual domains and residues in a ppr protein. this approach takes advantage of the relatively facile, although cultivar dependent, capacity for agrobacterium-mediated transformation of b. napus and the straightforward phenotype of fertility restoration. we show that the approach is sensitive enough to detect differences in the degree of fertility due, as least in part, to the copy number of a hypomorphic allele and that removal or replacement of domains with the corresponding domains of the related ppr gene, ppra lead to an apparent complete loss of function. in addition, we show that an apparent threshold level of rfo expression must be achieved for fertility restoration. it will be of interest to determine how the restoration activity of altered forms of the protein correlates with their affinity for the orf <dig> rna ligand.
