BACKGROUND
admixture mapping is an approach for localizing disease susceptibility loci that attempts to capitalize on the long-range linkage disequilibrium occurring in populations formed by recent mixing of ancestral populations  <cit> . the approach uses samples from recently admixed populations to detect susceptibility loci at which the risk alleles have different frequencies in the ancestral parental populations. admixture mapping is an economical and theoretically powerful approach. compared to linkage, admixture mapping does not require families and has more power. compared to association, admixture mapping requires ~200-500-fold fewer markers, is not susceptible to allelic heterogeneity, and can be used with either case-only or case-control study designs. admixture mapping can also be performed with generalized linear models to accommodate quantitative traits  <cit> . admixture mapping has been performed for many complex traits which exhibit strong differences in prevalence across ethnicities, such as end-stage renal disease  <cit> , hypertension  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit> , obesity  <cit> , peripheral arterial disease  <cit> , prostate cancer  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , serum inflammatory markers  <cit> , systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> , type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> , and white blood cell count  <cit> .

several groups have built panels of ancestry-informative markers  based on multiple databases of human genetic variation  <cit> . previously, admixture mapping required the construction of panels of aims based on screening large reference sets of genetic variation for ancestry-informative markers followed by de novo genotyping at those preselected markers in the admixed study sample and the samples representing the  ancestral parental populations  <cit> . however, given commercially available high-density marker arrays, it is now possible to construct customized panels from markers already genotyped in the admixed study sample  <cit> .

in this study, we constructed marker panels for admixture mapping with african american populations, starting from the affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig> , which probes variation at  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphisms . using genome-wide genotypes in our study sample of african americans already experimentally determined for genome-wide association studies and hapmap data to represent the presumed ancestral parental populations, we constructed one panel consisting of snps with large differences in allele frequencies between the ancestral parental populations and a second panel consisting of snps with large fst values between the ancestral parental populations. we also constructed a panel consisting of random markers not selected to be ancestrally informative. characteristics of these panels, including the number of markers and information content, are presented. as a test case, we apply these panels to a study of hypertension in african americans.

methods
study population
the admixed population under study comprised participants in the howard university family study  from the washington, d.c. metropolitan area  <cit> . the first phase of recruitment involved enrolling and examining a randomly ascertained cohort of african american families with members in multiple generations. to facilitate nested case-control study designs, additional unrelated individuals from the same geographic area were enrolled in a second phase of recruitment. participants were not ascertained based on any phenotypes. participants were interviewed and measured for various anthropometric and clinical variables. blood pressure was measured in the sitting position using an oscillometric device . three readings were taken with a ten minute interval between readings. the reported systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were the average of the second and third readings. hypertension case status was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥  <dig> mmhg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥  <dig> mmhg, or treatment with antihypertensive medication. we identified a subset of  <dig>  unrelated individuals including  <dig> hypertensive cases and  <dig> controls for use in admixture mapping.

genome-wide genotyping in the hufs was performed using the affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig> . dna samples were prepared and hybridized following the manufacturer's instructions  <cit> . genotype calls were made using the birdseed algorithm, version  <dig>  <cit> . we had four inclusion criteria: the individual sample call rate had to be ≥ 95% , the snp call rate had to be ≥ 95% , the minor allele frequency had to be ≥  <dig>  , and the p-value for the hardy-weinberg  test of equilibrium had to be ≥  <dig> ×10- <dig> . after filtering,  <dig>  autosomal and x chromosomal snps remained.

hapmap phase iii ceu , yri , and asw  genotype data were obtained from the international hapmap project http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/genotypes/2008-07_phaseiii/. we retained unrelated individuals, leaving  <dig> ceu individuals,  <dig> yri individuals, and  <dig> asw individuals. we used the same criteria  for filtering genotypes. after filtering, the intersection of the ceu, yri, and hufs data sets included  <dig>  snps. we used these contemporary samples of  <dig> unrelated ceu individuals and  <dig> unrelated yri individuals as proxy samples for the presumed ancestral parental populations of our african american sample.

δ and fst calculations
for a given snp, δ was calculated as the absolute difference in allele frequencies in the ceu and yri data, δ = |pceu - pyri|. wright  <cit>  suggested the fixation index fst to evaluate population differentiation. we estimated fst between the ceu and yri samples using the formula  in which  and . wright  <cit>  suggested qualitative guidelines for the interpretation of fst: values from  <dig> to  <dig>  indicate little population differentiation, values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicate moderate population differentiation, values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicate large population differentiation, and values above  <dig>  indicate very large population differentiation.

genetic map of snps
the rutgers combined linkage-physical map of the human genome was used to locate markers on the genetic map  given positions on the physical map . the positions of snps on the genetic map were obtained using a web-based application http://integrin.ucd.ie/cgi-bin/rs2cm.cgi.

selection of ancestry-informative markers from hapmap data
we followed a six-step process to select aims. first, we selected snps for which the minor allele frequency was ≥  <dig>  in both ancestry populations . second, we filtered for snps for which δ ≥  <dig>  between ceu and yri. third, we divided each chromosome into consecutive, non-overlapping bins of size  <dig> mb and sorted the snps within each bin in descending order according to the δ values. fourth, for each chromosome, we estimated pairwise correlations between the top-ranked snps across the bins. fifth, for each pair of snps, if r <dig> ≥  <dig>  in either the ceu or yri sample, we discarded the snp with the smaller δ value from its bin and promoted all remaining snps in that bin. if δ values were equal , we discarded the distal snp. we iterated steps 4- <dig> until r <dig> <  <dig>  in either of the ceu or yri sample for all pairs of top-ranked snps per bin. the resulting panel comprised  <dig>  aims. we repeated this entire process based on fst ≥  <dig> , yielding a second panel consisting of  <dig>  aims. given δ =  <dig> , the allowable values of fst range from δ <dig> =  <dig>  to  <cit> . similarly, given fst =  <dig> , the allowable values of δ range from  to  <cit> . these calculations show the comparability of the two thresholds.

information content and map power
we calculated the shannon information content , defined as  

in which a <dig> =  × pyri, a <dig> = m × pceu, a <dig> =  × , a <dig> = m × , and m is the proportion of european ancestry.

for a locus i and individual j, xij was defined as the entropy of the locus-specific ancestry estimate and gj was defined as the entropy of the genome-wide ancestry estimate. the relative power at locus i was defined as . if xij = gj for all j, then ri =  <dig> and there is no additional information about local ancestry beyond information about genome-wide ancestry. if xij =  <dig> for all j, then rj =  <dig> and there is perfect information for local ancestry  <cit> . the statistic ri and the average of ri across loci, ravg, were estimated using ancestrymap  <cit> . relative to a study with perfect information about local ancestry , 1/ravg times as many samples must be genotyped to achieve comparable power  <cit> .

estimation of individual admixture and population structure
we used the variance inflation factor  to prune markers in linkage disequilibrium . the vif is equal to,  in which  is the multiple correlation coefficient. a vif of  <dig> implies that the index snp is completely independent of all other snps. starting from a common set of snps passing quality control among the hapmap ceu, hapmap yri, and hufs data sets, we used ld-based pruning  to generate a set of  <dig>  snps with minimal ld between the markers. we then randomly selected one-third of the snps to obtain a random marker panel  that had 10-fold greater marker density than the aims panels. we also generated an additional panel  by randomly sub-sampling 10% of the  <dig> k random panel to match the marker density of the aims panels. we examined clustering using a parametric approach implemented in structure  <cit>  and a nonparametric approach implemented in awclust  <cit> . analysis was performed in structure without any prior population assignment and was performed ten times for each number of clusters , with  <dig>  burn-in steps and a run length of  <dig>  steps under the admixture model. we recorded the log likelihood of each analysis conditional on k estimated by structure. compared with this parametric approach, the nonparametric approach in awclust  <cit>  uses allele-sharing distance  and ward's minimum variance algorithm to cluster the individuals in the asd matrix. awclust does not assume hardy-weinberg equilibrium or linkage equilibrium and does not require allele frequency estimates. we varied k from one to six in both programs.

application of the panels to a study of hypertension
two statistics were used to test for the presence of disease loci using ancestymap  <cit> . one was the locus-genome statistic, which compared the admixture proportion at one locus with the genome-wide average among cases only. the locus-genome statistic was tested via a likelihood-ratio statistic, i.e., the likelihood of a locus being a disease locus to the likelihood of the locus not being a disease locus. the lod score was defined as the likelihood-ratio test statistic divided by 2ln. the genome-wide significance threshold of the lod score was set at  <dig>  <cit> . the other statistic was the case-control statistic, which compared cases with controls at every point in the genome, testing for differences in ancestry estimates. a deviation from the genome-wide average of one parental population ancestry seen in cases but not in controls provided evidence of a disease locus. the case-control statistic followed the standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis that a locus was not a disease locus. the genome-wide significance threshold of the z-statistic was set at ±  <dig>  for the two panels of aims and ±  <dig>  for the panel based on random markers. we specified in the disease model that the relative risk for hypertensive heart disease among african americans was  <dig>  compared to european americans  <cit> .

RESULTS
marker panels for admixture mapping in african americans
the distribution of snps across the aims panels , the other based on fst contained  <dig>  aims ) and two random marker panels  are shown in table  <dig>  the panels covered all  <dig> autosomes and the x chromosome . all marker panels showed lower heterozygosities in the parental samples than in the admixed sample, with the two panels of aims showing ascertainment effects of lower heterozygosities in the parental samples and higher heterozygosity in the admixed sample . scatter plots of allele frequencies for aims showed clear differentiation of the two parental populations , as did the structure plot assuming k =  <dig> populations  and the awclust plot . excluding centromeres, the average inter-marker distance was  <dig>  cm for the panel based on δ,  <dig>  cm for the panel based on fst,  <dig>  cm for the panel based on  <dig> k random markers, and  <dig>  cm for the panel based on  <dig> k random markers . the average values of δ, fst, and sic were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the δ panel,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the fst panel,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the  <dig> k random marker panel, and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the  <dig> k random marker panel, respectively .

the two panels of aims shared  <dig>  markers. the remaining markers  showed no significant difference in shannon information content  . the δ and fst values in the two panels were highly positively correlated . the δ in the panel based on δ was significantly higher than δ estimated from the panel based on fst . similarly, fst in the panel based on fst was significantly higher than fst in the panel based on δ .

sample characteristics
the genome-wide average fst between hufs and yri was  <dig> , indicating little population differentiation. the genome-wide average fst was  <dig>  between hufs and ceu and  <dig>  between ceu and yri, both indicating moderate population differentiation. as expected, these results indicated that our admixed hufs sample was more similar to yri than ceu, i.e., the proportion of african ancestry exceeded the proportion of european ancestry. similarly, principal coordinate analysis showed that the hufs sample was intermediate between the two ancestral parental populations and on average closer to yri than ceu . the estimated proportions of african ancestry in the hufs sample using ancestrymap were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the autosomes and the x chromosome, respectively.

admixture information content
we evaluated the informativeness of the two panels of random markers compared to the informativeness of the two panels of aims. the proportions of markers in the panel of  <dig> k random markers for which ri ≥  <dig> , ri ≥  <dig> , and ri ≥  <dig>  were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, and the panel had a map power of ravg =  <dig> . the proportions of markers in the panel of aims based on δ for which ri ≥  <dig> , ri ≥  <dig> , and ri ≥  <dig>  were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the panel of aims based on fst yielded values similar to those from the panel of aims based on δ values. the map power was ravg =  <dig>  for the panels based on δ and fst . the proportion of markers in the panel based on  <dig> k random markers for which ri ≥  <dig> , ri ≥  <dig> , and ri ≥  <dig>  were  <dig> %, 0%, and 0%, respectively, and the panel had a map power of ravg =  <dig>  . these estimates indicate that the two panels of aims extracted more ancestry information than a 10-fold denser panel of random markers and much more than the  <dig> k random marker panel. using the ravg statistic, one would need to study  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   times as many samples to maintain power to detect disease genes as would be necessary if one had full ancestry information, using the panels based on δ, fst,  <dig> k random markers, and  <dig> k random markers, respectively.

we constructed panels conditional on approximate linkage equilibrium over  <dig> mb bins. our iterative pruning procedure was designed to avoid gaps in coverage and to eliminate background linkage disequilibrium. to compare our panels with previously published panels, we obtained two panels of aims developed for african americans by tian et al.  <cit> . from their panel of  <dig>  aims,  <dig> aims were in common with the ceu, yri, and hufs data sets and all  <dig> aims passed quality control. similarly,  <dig> aims from their panel of  <dig>  aims were in common with the ceu, yri, and hufs data sets and all  <dig> aims passed quality control. as a result of the substantial reduction in marker density, the map power was reduced for both panels of tian et al. using our hufs data set . the substantial reduction in marker density occurred because the panels of tian et al. were developed independently of the affymetrix chip we used for genotyping our sample and there was little overlap in the snps in their panels and on the chip. to investigate if this limitation also applied to another african american data set, we obtained the hapmap phase iii asw data. in the asw data set, ~50% of the aims in either panel of tian et al. were present, compared to > 98% of the aims from our panels, whereas almost every aim present in the data passed quality control . these comparisons highlight the advantage of being able to customize a panel using preexisting gwas genotypes, especially for filling in gaps to improve coverage.

application of the admixture panels
as an example of applying our newly developed panels, we investigated hypertension in the hufs. the relative risk for hypertensive heart disease among african americans was  <dig>  compared to european americans  <cit> . averaged genome-wide, the individual proportion of european ancestry was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  among normotensive subjects and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  among hypertensive subjects, for the panels based on δ, fst, and  <dig> k random markers, respectively. although this result suggests that most of the differential risk in hypertension is probably not explainable by genetics, it does not preclude specific loci from significantly contributing to differential risk. assuming the hybrid isolation model, i.e., a single generation of admixture with no subsequent gene flow, the estimated number of generations since the original admixture event was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the panels based on δ, fst, and  <dig> k random markers, respectively.

we performed admixture mapping using both the locus-genome and case-control statistics for hypertension in the hufs data. no marker reached genome-wide significance for hypertension case/control status using ancestrymap . using a pairwise score test for markers shared between the two aim panels, no significant difference was found between the panels . similarly, using a t-test for aims not shared between the two panels, no significant difference was found between the panels .

discussion
in this study, we constructed panels of markers with variable informativeness for ancestry in admixed african americans. we had previously genotyped our sample using the affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig>  for genome-wide association studies. repurposing markers for admixture mapping eliminates the need for de novo genotyping. after linkage disequilibrium-based pruning, we constructed a set of  <dig>  uncorrelated markers with large differences in allele frequencies and another set of  <dig>  uncorrelated markers with large fst values. using these ancestry-informative markers, we estimated that the proportion of european ancestry in our sample of  <dig>  unrelated african americans from washington, d.c. was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for both panels, comparable to an estimated proportion of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in a sample of  <dig> african americans with multiple sclerosis and  <dig> controls  <cit> . using a set of  <dig> k random markers  in our study yielded a slightly higher estimate of admixture proportions . although it is possible to perform genome-wide admixture mapping using panels of markers not preselected to be informative for ancestry  <cit> , our results confirm that a few thousand aims can be used to estimate admixture proportions as efficiently as 10-fold more random markers.

admixed populations most commonly used in admixture mapping to date involve those formed by recent admixture between groups originating from different continents as a result of european maritime expansion during the past few hundred years  <cit> . the number of generations since the original admixture event based on our sample of african americans was estimated at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  generations for the panels based on δ and fst, respectively. this estimate is similar to previous estimates of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> , and  <dig>  <cit> . thus, these estimates are stable across different marker panels and different samples of african americans.

the power of admixture mapping is affected by the information content of the marker map, the sample size, and admixture proportions. we estimated that both aim panels had an average map power of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which is similar to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for a previously constructed panel of  <dig>  aims in african americans  <cit> . the two panels had higher map power than the panel of  <dig> k random markers, which had an average map power of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . for the locus-genome statistic, a sample size of  <dig> cases provides 70% power to detect a locus conferring  <dig> -fold increased risk due to ancestry  <cit> . our study sample size of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls was underpowered for loci conferring  <dig> -fold or less risk due to ancestry. although the power of admixture mapping decreases in populations with a much larger contribution from only one parental population  <cit> , the map power is fairly constant for values of admixture proportion from 10% to 90%  <cit> . our estimated values of 19% european ancestry and 81% african ancestry both fall within this range.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed two panels of aims for admixture mapping in african americans from experimentally determined genotypes using the affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig> . we constructed the panels conditional on linkage equilibrium over  <dig> mb bins. our iterative pruning procedure was designed to avoid gaps in coverage and to eliminate background linkage disequilibrium. given the mathematical relationship between δ and fst, we recommend both panels of aims equally.

developing marker panels for admixture mapping from existing genotype data derived from commercial high density snp chips offers two major advantages.  no de novo genotyping needs to be done, thereby saving costs.  markers can be filtered for various quality measures and replacement markers  can be selected at no additional cost. for our african american sample, we took advantage of preexisting hapmap genotypes for the ceu and yri samples, but appropriate parental populations may not have already been sampled for some admixed populations. we found that the map power for sparser panels of aims is higher than for denser panels of  <dig> k random markers. historically, the number of aims in an admixture panel reflected the trade-off between maximizing genomic coverage and minimizing genotyping costs. currently, custom genotyping a panel of ~ <dig>  aims is less expensive than chip-based genome-wide genotyping. however, chip-based genome-wide genotyping is currently less expensive than custom genotyping a panel of ~ <dig>  random markers. presumed parental populations are necessary to characterize aims. in contrast, parental populations are not needed to characterize random markers prior to estimating admixture proportions. apart from needing many more random markers compared to aims, the major disadvantage of using a panel of random markers without parental populations or external reference samples is the inability to label clusters. taken together, the ability to develop dense panels of markers from commercial chips provides a fresh opportunity to conduct admixture mapping for disease genes in admixed populations.
