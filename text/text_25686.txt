BACKGROUND
ckx genes belong to a small family of genes coding cytokinin dehydrogenase, which metabolizes cytokinins in plants. in arabidopsis the genes differ for tissue and organ-specific expression  <cit>  and ckx enzymes showed various biochemical properties and subcellular localization  <cit> . spatial and temporal differences in expression may contribute to functional differentiation  <cit> . the expression of hvckx <dig> was highest in the roots and developing spikes of barley. the transcript reduction in these organs  resulted in higher plant productivity and mass of the roots  <cit> . the role of the other hvckx genes in barley is poorly understood. two of them, hvckx <dig> and hvckx <dig>  were cloned and the expression of one caused a cytokinin-deficient phenotype in the heterologous host plants of tobacco  <cit> . full-length osckx <dig> homologues of barley hvckx <dig>  and hvckx <dig>  were characterized with a comparative analysis  <cit> .

barley is fourth among important cereal species with respect to worldwide production. it has also been suggested as a valuable diploid cereal model in genetic studies as well as in poaceae biology  <cit> . the newly developed biotechnological tool of gene silencing by means of rna interference makes it possible to knock out or essentially decrease the expression of selected native genes to analyze their function. the efficiency of gene silencing essentially increased with the application of self-complementary “hairpin” hprna cassettes  <cit> . for this purpose silencing cassettes containing fragments of the gene of interest in sense and antisense orientation separated by an intron are introduced into the plant genome by genetic transformation. during transcription, a double-stranded hairpin rna  is formed and recognized by the plant machinery to induce a silencing signal, which is short interfering rna . the homology of sirna to any transcript, for example the mrna of the gene, initiates the degradation process and posttranscriptional gene silencing . nowadays, this is the best way of obtaining the “mutant”/changed phenotype for analysis of gene function and plant improvement, especially for species with large genomes, like cereals, for which real mutants are for most of the genes unavailable  <cit> .

there are two basic methods of cereal transformation: indirect and direct. the indirect method is based on the introduction of the plasmid-carrying gene construct/silencing cassette to the plant cell by means of agrobacterium. the direct method uses microprojectile bombardment . the agrobacterium-mediated method is recommended as the method of choice, because of the introduction, in most cases, of one copy of a non-rearranged or slightly rearranged transgene. however, the efficiency of the method for monocots is still unsatisfactory. the biolistic method was the first one developed and applied in cereals. however, after years of research the disadvantages of the method seemed to be more limiting than that mediated via agrobacterium <cit> . the most distinctive is the presence of multiple copies of the introduced gene with large rearrangements. an epigenetic consequence of the physically and genetically destructive biolistic method might be the somaclonal variation, which reflects the adaptation process of cells to a different environment  <cit> . krizova et al.  <cit>  suggest that epigenetic changes associated with dedifferentiation might influence regulatory pathways mediated by the trans-ptgs processes. both pathways of silencing by ptgs and transcriptional gene silencing  might be influenced by environmental and developmental factors  <cit> . all the unprofitable effects influence transgene cassette expression, which is the main problem in the application of genetic transformation.

the advantages and disadvantages of both indirect and direct methods have already been evaluated in many species, including the model for cereals, rice  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . in most of the papers the comparison of both methods was based on the expression cassette containing some marker or reporter transgenes. we compared the silencing effect of one native gene of barley, hvckx <dig>  directed by the same silencing cassette but introduced by the agrobacterium-mediated and biolistic method. in both methods the same selection cassette was used as well.

we found that the method of genetic transformation used for the silencing of developmentally regulated genes strongly influenced the plant phenotype. the advantages of agrobacterium-mediated transformation in this process were proven. silencing of the hvckx <dig> gene via agrobacterium, as in the case of hvckx <dig>  determined organ-specific changes resulting in higher productivity of the modified lines.

RESULTS
transformation efficiency via biolistic and agrobacterium-mediated method
in total,  <dig> putative transgenic plants were selected from  <dig> immature embryos of golden promise and scarlett after biolistic transformation. six of them were confirmed as transgenic, giving the transformation efficiency of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . the agrobacterium-mediated transformation of  <dig> explants of golden promise and  <dig> immature embryos of scarlett resulted in obtaining  <dig> transgenic plants of the first cultivar with a mean transformation efficiency of  <dig> % and only  <dig> plant of the second cultivar . the transformation efficiency of golden promise after biolistic transformation was more than twice as low compared with the agrobacterium-mediated transformation . these data for the cultivar scarlett were very low  and the differences were not significant.

the integration of silencing for the hvckx <dig> cassette and selection cassette containing bar under the control of ubi <dig> intron promoter in t <dig> and t <dig> plants was tested by pcr with at least three pairs of specific primers. 78% of putative transgenic t <dig> plants and all the tested lines were proved to be transgenic .

the productivity of t <dig> plants decreases after biolistic silencing of hvckx <dig> and increases after agrobacterium-mediated silencing
the morphology of silenced, in vitro plants  was similar to the control plants, and independent of the method of transformation. all of them set seeds. the mean productivity of t <dig> plants, which is expressed as the number of grains and grain yield, the weight and ckx activity in the bulked samples of t <dig> roots of cv. golden promise and cv. scarlett, transformed with a silencing cassette for the hvckx <dig> gene via the biolistic method, is presented in table  <dig>  almost all the data were lower in transgenic compared to control in vitro plants in both cultivars. control, non-silenced plants were obtained in the same conditions of in vitro culture. the mean number of grains in transgenic plants was 32% lower in golden promise and 51% lower  compared to the control; grain yield was 39% and 52% lower respectively. similar lower data were obtained for  <dig> grain weight and mean weight of t <dig> roots in transgenic plants of golden promise compared to the control. the data of ckx activity for bulked samples of t <dig> roots of golden promise were almost the same in the groups of transgenic and control plants and, for scarlett, substantially higher in transgenic plants. there was no effect of silencing in the t <dig> roots of lines transformed via the biolistic method.

the mean productivity of t <dig> plants, the weight and ckx activity in the bulked samples of t <dig> roots of cv. golden promise transformed with a silencing cassette for the hvckx <dig> gene via the agrobacterium-mediated method is presented in table  <dig>  control, non-silenced plants were obtained in the same conditions of in vitro culture and selection. the data are from two different experiments,  <dig> and  <dig> , and in both of them the results were higher in the groups of plants transformed with a silencing cassette compared with the control plants. the mean number of grains per plant increased to 163% and 144% and the grain yield was 167% and 135% higher, depending on the experiment. the mean  <dig> grain weight was similar for agrobacterium-silenced and control lines, as was the mean weight of t <dig> roots, although in this case only for plants from experiment  <dig>  additionally, ckx activity in bulked samples of t <dig> roots, obtained after agrobacterium-mediated silencing, in contrast to the data from the biolistic method, was decreased by over 29% compared to the non-silenced control.

the level of hvckx <dig> silencing and the enzyme ckx activity in the t <dig> progeny differ depending on transformation method
up to twelve progeny plants were examined from five biolistic-derived t <dig> lines and seven t <dig> lines obtained via agrobacterium-mediated silencing. the data are related to the controls, assumed to be  <dig>  . relative hvckx <dig> transcript accumulation in  <dig> dap spikes of biolistic-silenced lines of golden promise ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and for one line of scarlett from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . some of the segregating progeny in each line showed significantly decreased relative hvckx <dig> transcript accumulation.

similar results of relative hvckx <dig> transcript accumulation in  <dig> dap spikes were obtained in lines transformed with agrobacterium; again the data for some of the progeny significantly exceeded the control level,  <dig>  . the range of data for seven lines was from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the hvckx <dig> transcript level in at least 1/ <dig> of segregating progeny of lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was reduced to about 50%.

the relative activity of ckx enzyme was measured in developing and fully developed leaves and  <dig> dap spikes in t <dig> plants obtained via biolistic and agrobacterium-mediated methods . the range of the data for developing leaves of four biolistic-silenced golden promise lines were from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and for developed leaves from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these data in most of the progeny dramatically exceeded the relative activity in the control . the results of enzyme activity in spikes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and some segregated progeny in two of five lines, lines  <dig> and  <dig>  showed significantly decreased ckx activity. the data in line  <dig> positively correlated with the lower enzyme activity in the leaves as well as with the lower level of transcript in  <dig> dap spikes .

the range of relative ckx activity in the lines silenced via agrobacterium was from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for developing leaves, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for developed leaves, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for  <dig> dap spikes. the ranges of data were not so wide and their standard deviation not so high as in t <dig> plants obtained via the biolistic method. the lowest data obtained in all the tested lines suggested an occurrence of segregating progeny with significantly decreased ckx activity in measured organs.

the phenotypic effect of hvckx <dig> silencing mediated via biolistic and agrobacterium transformation in t <dig> plants
the mean productivity, measured as the number of seeds per plant and grain yield, was decreased in four out of five biolistic-derived t <dig> lines , compared with the control lines . in the case of line  <dig> the difference for grain yield was statistically significant. the  <dig> grain weight in lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was significantly reduced as well. the mean data for the weight of roots, height of plants and spike number and length were more variable between the silenced lines and the control and there was not any general tendency. additionally, five plants from line  <dig> out of twelve tested in two experiments  did not set seeds, three plants from line  <dig> out of twelve  did not grow and one, 6/ <dig>  developed only one spike. most of the seeds in this line did not germinate. all the seeds of line  <dig> refused to germinate.

as documented in figure  <dig>  t <dig> plants 5/ <dig>  5/ <dig> and 5/ <dig>  which showed a lack of setting seeds, did not develop functional anthers. this phenotype was observed again in 5/ <dig> and 5/ <dig> plants of the same line in the second experiment . the size of the anthers was considerably reduced, and there was no pollen production. the relative level of hvckx <dig> transcript in the  <dig> dap spikes  as well as developing and developed leaves of these plants  was around  <dig> , similar to the control plants. however, ckx activity in young leaves of the same plants ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and for developed leaves from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these data of enzyme activity were in the range of data for seed-setting progeny from lines  <dig> and  <dig> of golden promise lines . ckx activity in the leaves of these plants was unbalanced and exceeded the level of the control plants. other data were obtained for ckx activity in  <dig> dap spikes. the range for all t <dig> plants of line  <dig> was from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the enzyme activity for individual, non-seed-setting plants of this line were:  <dig>  for plant 5/ <dig>   <dig>  for plant 5/ <dig>   <dig>  for plant 5/ <dig>   <dig>  for plant 5/ <dig> and  <dig>  for plant 5/ <dig>  none of the other seed-setting plants from lines  <dig> and  <dig> had such low activity of ckx in  <dig> dap spikes .

there was no problem with setting seeds in all tested  <dig> t <dig> plants derived from  <dig> lines silenced via agrobacterium and  <dig> t <dig> plants, progeny of  <dig> control lines, or in any other of the thousands obtained via agrobacterium and tested in our laboratory. the mean productivity expressed as the number of grains and grain yield was higher in silenced  lines compared with the control lines in both experiments and in all individual lines . the mean  <dig> grain yield exceeded the mean control value in four lines. the mean height of  <dig> out of  <dig> tested silenced lines was higher from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm than the mean for the four control lines, which was  <dig>  cm  and for line  <dig> the difference was statistically significant. the mean spike length in the agrobacterium-silenced group was only slightly higher, and the number of spikes was from  <dig>  to  <dig>  higher in  <dig> out of  <dig> tested lines compared with the control. this means that silenced t <dig> plants developed from  <dig>  to  <dig> spikes per plant more than non-silenced agrobacterium-transformed control t <dig> plants.

discussion
based on rnai processes, gene silencing has already been proven to be an efficient approach for functional genomics in cereals  <cit> . the stability of silencing cassette expression as well as directed gene silencing is one of the key requirements for the successful application of transgenic lines in basic research of gene function and agricultural genetic improvement. in this study we applied the posttranscriptional gene silencing process  to silenced hvckx <dig> in two barley cultivars by two different transformation methods: biolistic and agrobacterium.

golden promise cultivar is widely used in barley biotechnology/functional genomics, because of its susceptibility to agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which was also confirmed in this paper. the second one, cv. scarlett, showed very low transformation ability. the data obtained for golden promise with the bar selection system were  <dig> % for agrobacterium-mediated transformation and less than half this value,  <dig> %, after biolistic transformation. a comparable result for the same cultivar of barley, doubled transformation efficiency with agrobacterium compared to particle bombardment, was obtained by travella et al.  <cit> . these results are also in agreement with those obtained for rice  <cit> . the second cultivar tested, expressing very low efficiency after agrobacterium-mediated transformation, also showed very low efficiency after the biolistic method. we might assume that the susceptibility to bacteria was not the only limiting factor for cv. scarlett transformation. this result is against the hypothesis that genotype dependence of susceptibility to agrobacterium might be the limiting factor in applying the agrobacterium-mediated method, which should not appear in the biolistic method  <cit> .

the silencing of hvckx <dig> by the biolistic method determined low productivity and by agrobacterium high productivity of t <dig> plants. this general tendency of plant productivity was also transmitted to the next generation. higher productivity was the result of a higher number of seeds and grain yield, higher  <dig> grain weight as well as increased  height of plants and higher  numbers of spikes. we also documented that this higher productivity was correlated with lower levels of hvckx <dig> transcript in  <dig> dap spikes and decreased ckx activity in leaves and  <dig> dap spikes in the progeny of lines silenced via agrobacterium. the tissues/organs appropriate for analysis were chosen based on temporal and spatial expression of hvckx <dig> measured in developing wild barley cultivars of golden promise and scarlett. these data were highest in  <dig> dap spikes, followed by  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, as well as in the leaves . the phenotypic result of silencing of hvckx <dig> in these tissues via agrobacterium was higher productivity and increased height of silenced lines. these results confirm once again the hypothesis that spatial and temporal differences in expression contributed to functional differentiation  <cit> . the higher productivity might be the result of lower hvckx <dig> transcript in developing spikes and decreased ckx activity. increased height of silenced plants may be dependent on decreased ckx activity in the leaves, estimated at a high level in the wild plants. similar results of hvckx <dig> silencing via agrobacterium in golden promise, which correlated with the specific organs, were observed in our previous research  <cit> . the highest expression of the gene in wild-type plants was in  <dig> dap spikes, followed by  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, as well as in the roots. in that experiment, the silencing of hvckx <dig> led to higher plant productivity as well as higher mass of the roots, although the height of the plants was reduced. the reduced expression of another ckx gene in rice, osckx <dig>  caused cytokinin accumulation in the inflorescence meristems, increased the number of reproductive organs, and increased grain number and yield  <cit> . it was also documented that halophyte variants of tackx6d <dig>  a wheat ortholog of rice osckx <dig>  was associated with grain weight in hexaploid wheat  <cit> . newly published research on phylogenic and sequence analysis showed that ckx <dig> and ckx <dig> are closely related in clade ia of poaceae and are physically linked  <cit> . the authors hypothesized that both genes might have similar functions, which is supported by our earlier research on hvckx <dig> <cit>  and hvckx <dig> in this paper.

the opposite result of the plant productivity obtained in t <dig> and t <dig> lines, when hvckx <dig> was silenced with the biolistic method, might be explained by somaclonal variation  <cit> . this term, describing the phenotypic variability among plants of in vitro origin, includes genetic and epigenetic modifications  <cit> . both types of modifications in biolistic-derived plants are caused by a physically destructive method and integration of many, mostly rearranged copies of a transgene, the result of which is frequently determined transgene silencing  <cit> . due to resource limitation, the copy number was not examined in this study. however based on the knowledge from previously published papers  <cit>  the phenotypic differences in lines generated by two transformation methods might be attributed to different copy numbers of transgene integrated to the genome as well as the dna/transgene rearrangements. in such situations our silencing cassette introduced by the biolistic method might disturb the effect of silencing and the whole phenotype, otherwise visible in the group of agrobacterium-silenced plants. this effect, depending on the method of transformation, might be especially distinct in the case of the silencing of developmentally regulated genes, like ckxs. besides lower plant productivity, it also caused a lack of germination in one line and inability of seed setting in half of the progeny of another line . the primary reason was a lack of functional anthers. this was correlated with the lowered to 50% - 60% ckx activity in  <dig> dap spikes and it was not observed in seed-setting plants of biolistic origin. however, lowered ckx activity has also been proven in agrobacterium-silenced lines, where it resulted in higher productivity. the explanation of these differences might be observed, unbalanced ckx activity in the whole biolistic-derived plants – very high in the leaves and very low in the  <dig> dap spikes. this result proved the earlier reported observations in other plant species that ckxs respond differently to various stresses  <cit> . the effect of sbeiia silencing on starch metabolism in durum wheat lines obtained with the two methods of transformation, biolistic and agrobacterium, was genotype and protocol independent  <cit> . however, these results are not directly comparable with ours, because in that report two different cultivars were transformed with one of two methods, the silenced genes influenced only starch metabolism , and there was a lack of detailed data on productivity, possibly because of the character of the genes tested.

the final effect of the silencing observed in biolistic-derived and agrobacterium-derived plants was also different. the transcript level in segregating progeny of lines transformed by both methods was similar, decreased to 24%  and to 34% , and it was reduced in about 1/ <dig> of plants by more than 50%. the consequence of this reduction of transcript in agrobacterium-derived plants was decreased ckx activity in developing and developed leaves as well as in  <dig> dap spikes. otherwise the enzyme activity for developing and developed leaves of the lines of biolistic origin, especially in cv. golden promise, was very high, exceeding the relative level for control lines. this imbalanced effect of the low level of the transcript and very high ckx activity suggest disturbances of developmental processes, which are naturally guided by small rna at the transcriptional  and posttranscriptional  levels  <cit> . both ptgs and tgs may be influenced by environmental and developmental factors  <cit> . such disturbances in hvckx <dig> experimentally silenced by agrobacterium have not occurred, proving the applicability of the method for gene silencing of developmentally regulated genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of rnai–mediated hvckx <dig> silencing in t <dig> plants and t <dig> lines obtained by two different methods were contrasting. agrobacterium-silenced lines showed expected lower levels of transcript in the  <dig> dap kernels and decreased ckx enzyme activity in the leaves and  <dig> dap kernels. the phenotypic effect was higher plant productivity expressed by a higher number of seeds and grain yield as well as plant height. contrasting data were obtained in lines with hvckx <dig> silenced by the biolistic method. the first effect of silencing, which was a lower transcript level in  <dig> dap of segregating progeny, was comparable with that in agrobacterium-silenced lines. however, a decrease of ckx activity in the spikes determined the lack of pollen development and not seed-setting phenotype. additionally, the activity of the enzyme in the leaves of all golden promise progeny was imbalanced, exceeding the level of the control. the final phenotypic effect was a decrease of plant productivity. we suggest that the differences in silencing effect observed in transgenic lines generated by two transformation methods might be the result of different patterns of transgene integration including copy number and/or transgene rearrangements. the limitations of both transformation methods are discussed.

presented results prove the applicability of agrobacterium-mediated silencing and inapplicability of biolistic silencing for developmentally regulated genes.
