BACKGROUND
urate is the final purine intermediate of the purine nucleotide catabolism in human  <cit> . normally, urate is not accumulated in human body fluids and hence its concentration is a valuable indicator in clinical diagnosis  <cit>  indicating gout, hyperuricemia, or lesch-nyhan syndrome  <cit> . elevated urate levels are also related to e.g. increased alcohol and cholesterol consumption, obesity, diabetes, kidney and heart diseases, and they are considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases  <cit> .

uricase  is a key enzyme in the purine degradation pathway. it catalyzes the oxidation of urate in the presence of oxygen, producing allantoin and co <dig>  uricase does not require an additional cofactor other than oxygen for the enzymatic reaction and is therefore widely used for the amperometric determination of urate to diagnose gout and the above mentioned diseases and conditions. for urate determination in serum and urine, several biosensors have been reported  <cit> . numerous amperometric urate biosensors based on uricase or uricase coupled with peroxidase varying in the type of electrode, immobilization technique, ability and type of redox mediator, conductive polymers etc. have been described  <cit> .

several new amperometric uric acid biosensors were fabricated by immobilizing uricase onto gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes  <cit> . these urate-selective biosensors are using expensive commercially available uricases purified from bacillus fastidiosus, arthrobacter globiformis, or candida utilis. therefore, the fabrication of cheap urate-selective amperometric biosensors is still a challenging task.

in this work, we introduce a novel microbial urate-selective amperometric biosensor based on the cells of the uricase-overproducing recombinant yeast h. polymorpha.

RESULTS
construction of the uricase-overproducing recombinant yeast h. polymorpha
uricase-overproducing transformants of h. polymorpha were constructed using straight-forward microbiological techniques. the expression of target genes and corresponding enzymatic activity in yeasts is increased by repeated amplification of the required nucleotide sequence  <cit> . the plasmid pglg <dig> contains a bacterial aph gene  as dominant marker whose expression is impaired, and the sequence of the hars <dig>  autonomic replicating sequence. this ensures multiple tandem integration of pglg <dig> into the h. polymorpha telomere regions on medium containing the antibiotic g <dig>  <cit> .

the recombinant plasmid pglg61_uox  derived from pglg <dig> was transformed to the recipient strain h. polymorpha c- <dig> , impaired in glucose repression and devoid of catalase activity. the transformants were grown on yps medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of g <dig>  the highest concentration of g <dig> which allowed the transformants to grow was  <dig> mg ml- <dig>  the transformants were stabilized by cultivation in non-selective media for 10- <dig> generations with further shifting to the selective media with g <dig>  the presence of the expression cassette in the stable transformants was examined by diagnostic pcr using the primers ko183/ko <dig> and the genomic dna of stable transformants as a template. fragments of predictable size  were obtained .

the parental strain С- <dig> exhibits impairment in glucose catabolite repression of alcohol oxidase  synthesis resulting in the induction of aox in a glucose containing growth medium  <cit> . stable transformants bearing uox under control of the aox promoter with increased uox enzyme activity were screened by a plate patches assay in solid glucose-containing medium. finally, six positive recombinant strains  were selected .

the uox activity in cell-free extracts of the selected strains was determined spectrophotometrically. as shown in figure 2a, the uox activity of the selected strains varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  u ml- <dig>  while the initial strain of h. polymorpha c- <dig> showed no significant enzyme activity under the same growth conditions. the c- <dig> cells were cultivated in urate containing medium for induction of uricase. the uox activity of c- <dig> cultivated under inducing conditions was  <dig>  u ml- <dig>  thus, the most active strain  <dig> showed a forty-fold higher uox activity as compared to the parental strain.

the vector used for construction of uox producers, pglg61_uox, supports multiple tandem integration into the telomeric chromosome region  <cit> . the uricase gene copy number of strain  <dig> was established by quantitative southern dot-blot via serial dilutions of the genomic dna and comparing to untransformed strain's single-copy signal of the h. polymorpha uricase gene. the estimated vector copy number in transformants which are resistant to  <dig> mg ml- <dig> g <dig> was approximately  <dig> .

the dependence of uox activity of strain  <dig> on the growth phase is presented in figure 2b. the maximal level of uox activity in cell-free extracts occurred after  <dig> h of cell cultivation . this is in agreement with the dynamics of the development of the aox activity in c- <dig> strain during cultivation in the same medium. as the yeast h. polymorpha belongs to the class of thermotolerant species with highest growth temperature around 50°c  <cit> , the thermal stability of uox was examined by incubating a cell-free extract for  <dig> min at 50°c. uricase lost about 32% of its activity and reached an activity of  <dig>  u ml- <dig> at 50°c. obtained data is in accordance with the thermal stability of uricase of c. utilis. treatment at 50°c caused about 60% of activity maximum in the crude extract of the yeast  <cit> .

the constructed overproducing strains exhibit significantly lower uox activity as compared with commercially available recombinant uox from escherichia coli or saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . however, their genetic background makes the constructed strains a unique ideal biorecognition element in microbial urate-selective amperometric biosensors. the block in catalase activity leads to the generation of h2o <dig> as a result of urate oxidation that can be easily detected amperometrically. a defect in the gene responsible for catalase synthesis forced the cells to develop a mechanism of h2o <dig> depletion through its extrusion from the cell  <cit> . h2o <dig> released from the cell facilitating its detection. the impairment in glucose repression of the constructed strains allows for the overproduction of uox in a low-priced glucose-containing growth medium that does not required expensive inducers, i.e. uric acid  <cit> .

evaluation and optimization of the urate biosensor
uox catalyzes in vivo oxidation of uric acid in the presence of oxygen as an oxidizing agent producing allantoin and co <dig> as oxidation products of uric acid and hydrogen peroxide as a reduction product of o <dig>  the amperometric detection of uric acid can be performed by electrochemical oxidation of the produced h2o <dig>  however, there is one serious problem which has to be solved in such sensors, namely that uric acid itself is oxidized at pt, au and carbon electrodes at the potentials necessary to oxidize h2o <dig>  <cit> . amperometric detection of h2o <dig> using horseradish peroxidase  for its biocatalytic reduction to water has been proposed  <cit> .

a bienzyme system comprising uox and one of a hydrogen peroxide decomposing enzymes  or microperoxidase ) was evaluated for the construction of urate-selective biosensors. the reaction scheme and electron-transfer pathway is presented in figure  <dig> 

biosensor based on living cells of the uricase-overproducing recombinant strain of h. polymorpha coupled with hrp exhibited the highest kinetic parameters imax =  <dig> na, km =  <dig>  mm for urate . kinetic parameters of sensors based on cat or mp- <dig> were quite similar , however, due to the fact that the hrp-based sensors showed the highest km-value all further investigations were done with hrp-based sensors. this feature provides a wider range of linearity thus improving the accuracy of the analysis by reducing of the necessary sample dilutions. moreover the response time for the sensor based on hrp  was shorter than that for cat  or mp- <dig> .

the immobilization of the strain  <dig> cells on graphite disk electrodes was achieved by physical fixation behind dialysis membranes. for further optimization, the ratio of hrp to the cells and hence to uox was varied. a combination of  <dig> μl of hrp solution and  <dig> μl of cell suspension showed the highest current response . the increase in the hrp/cell ratio let to a decrease of the current response apparently due to physical blocking of the electrode surface with hrp. the response time for the optimized sensor upon addition of  <dig>  mm urate was about  <dig>  na min- <dig>  a typical current response of a sensor with optimized architecture is shown in figure  <dig>  the detection limit of the sensor was determined to be  <dig> μm and the apparent km value obtained from several independent calibrations was  <dig>  mm for urate. the optimal ph range for the urate biosensor was  <dig>  to  <dig> , the optimal temperature range was between  <dig> to 42°c .

for application of the optimized prototype of the urate sensor in real samples, its selectivity with respect to potential interferences such as ascorbate, citrate, l-lactate, succinate, d-glucose, and ethanol is of great importance. hence, the current response of the urate biosensor was evaluated with respect to these substances . the biosensor exhibits about 10% of cross-sensitivity to ethanol and ascorbate relative to the urate output level. however, no relative cross sensitivity to the other investigated compounds was observed. as the interfering compounds are present in significantly lower concentrations e.g. in urine, the impact of these compounds on the determination of urate in most real samples is assumed to be negligible.

the main characteristics of the developed urate selective microbial biosensors are comparable with previously reported results, such as an uox-microperoxidase bi-enzyme system based on au-electrode  <cit>  or a redox mediator  containing uox-hrp system based on graphite electrode  <cit> . the detection limit is higher , while the linear detection range is wider . the km-values  <cit>  coincide with our results. at the same time the estimated costs of the biosensor based on the urate selective microbial cells appears to be significantly reduced.

CONCLUSIONS
a strain of h. polymorpha overproducing uox was constructed. genomic integration of expression cassettes of the uricase gene under the control of the strong h. polymorpha aox promoter resulted in a 40-fold increase in the uox activity compared to the parental strain. a method for preliminary screening of the recombinant strains was developed. the conditions for strain cultivation were optimized to ensure the maximal amount of the target enzyme.

the strain identified as the one possessing highest uox activity was used for the construction of amperometric urate biosensors. a urate-selective biorecognition layer was designed comprising living cells of the recombinant h. polymorpha strain coupled to hrp. the terminal amperometric detection was achieved by direct electron transfer between hrp and the graphite electrode at - <dig> mv vs. ag/agcl. the sensor design was optimized and a ratio of hrp/cells of 1: <dig> yielded the highest current response. the detection limit of the optimized sensor design was  <dig> μm and the apparent km-value  <dig>  mm. future research will be directed to further increasing the uox activity of h. polymorpha and optimization of the electron-transfer cascade of the described bi-enzyme system.

the uox activity in cell-free extracts was determined spectrophotometrically by following the decrease of the absorbance at  <dig> nm. assay mixtures contained  <dig>  mm urate in  <dig>  m tris-hc <dig> buffer   <cit> . the reaction was started by the addition of the cell extract. enzyme assays were performed at 25°c. one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to transform  <dig> μmol of urate into allantoin in  <dig> min at 25°c and ph  <dig> .

strains with elevated uox activity were screened by a plate patch assay. uox activity was visualized by the rate of h2o <dig> formation. h2o <dig> is formed in the reaction of uox with urate and can be monitored by the peroxidative oxidation of o-dianisidine in the presence of horseradish peroxidase  leading to a purple colouring of the patches. the transformants were patched onto mineral medium agar plates supplemented with glucose. after  <dig> h of incubation at 37°c, the plates were overlaid with  <dig> ml of the uox activity assay mixture containing  <dig>  m tris-hc <dig> buffer ,  <dig> %  agar, digitonin , o-dianisidine , hrp sigma rz  <dig>  , and urate . the plates were incubated at 37°c for up to  <dig> h. patches that stained faster were selected for further experiments. all assay experiments were repeated at least twice.
