BACKGROUND
apoptosis is an active program of cell death that is required for normal development and tissue homeostasis in metazoans  <cit> . the deregulation of apoptotic pathways underlies many human diseases  <cit> . consequently, apoptotic pathways represent potential targets for therapeutic control of cell death for diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancer  <cit> . our previous studies have uncovered the existence of an apoptotic pathway termed the taf6δ pathway that controls cell death  <cit> .

taf6δ is an inducible splice variant of the tfiid subunit taf <dig> . tfiid is a multiprotein complex containing the tata-binding protein  and up to  <dig> evolutionarily conserved tbp-associated factors   <cit> . tfiid is the primary core promoter recognition complex for rna polymerase ii  and thus plays a key role in the regulation of transcription of protein-coding genes  <cit> . the major taf6α isoform is ubiquitously expressed  <cit>  whereas strong expression of the taf6δ isoform has only been detected in apoptotic conditions   <cit> . the use of modified antisense rna oligonucleotides, also termed splice-switching oligonucleotides , to experimentally direct the expression of endogenous taf6δ in living cells has recently demonstrated the pro-apoptotic activity of taf6δ  <cit> .

the major taf6α isoform contributes to the stability of core tfiid complexes in part by dimerizing with taf <dig> via its histone fold domain  <cit> . structurally, taf6δ differs from taf6α only in that it lacks  <dig> amino acids within its histone fold domain. these amino acids, however, are critical for the interaction of taf6α with taf <dig>  <cit> , and as a consequence, taf6δ cannot interact with taf <dig>  <cit> . as is the case for taf <dig>  the highly homologous protein taf9b cannot interact with the pro-apoptotic taf6δ isoform  <cit> . taf6δ does retain the capacity to interact directly with other tfiid subunits including taf <dig>  taf <dig>  tbp and taf <dig>  consequently, within cells taf6δ is incorporated into a tfiid-like complex that lacks taf <dig> and taf9b, termed tfiidπ  <cit> . depletion of taf <dig> or the highly homologous protein taf9b in hela cells has been shown to alter global gene expression patterns  <cit> . presently it is not known whether the transcriptional effects of taf6δ are related to those resulting from the depletion of taf <dig> and/or taf9b. our previous work revealed that taf6δ can alter gene expression  <cit> , but a physiologically informative definition of the transcriptome impact of taf6δ is currently lacking.

data documenting a direct interaction between the major taf6α isoform with p <dig> has been shown in vitro using recombinant proteins  <cit> , in vitro using endogenous human tfiid  <cit> , and in cultured cells using reporter assays  <cit> . furthermore, the interaction of taf6α with p <dig> has been shown to be essential for the activation of transcription by p <dig> in vitro  <cit>  as well as in vivo in mice bearing point mutations within p <dig> that block its interaction with taf6α  <cit> . currently it is not known whether the inducible pro-apoptotic taf6δ isoform can interact with p <dig>  importantly, taf6δ induces apoptosis in cell lines that lack p <dig> expression  <cit> . moreover, the induction of taf6δ produced similar levels of apoptosis in the hct- <dig> p <dig> -/- colon carcinoma cell line as in its p <dig> positive counterpart  <cit> . thus, taf6δ can induce programmed cell death independently of p <dig>  however the functional relationship between the taf6δ and p <dig> pathways requires further clarification.

the taf6δ pathway represents a tractable experimental paradigm to elucidate the mechanisms by which human cells respond to their environment through subunit changes in the general transcription machinery  <cit> . moreover, there is mounting evidence that the taf6δ pathway may be altered in certain cancers. aberrant taf <dig> expression has been documented in human cancers including lung cancer  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit> . the molecular basis for the induction of apoptosis by taf6δ is currently unknown. in order to shed further light on the impact of taf6δ on the human transcriptome, here we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of the impact of endogenous taf6δ expression in hela cervical carcinoma cells. our data provide the first physiologically coherent transcriptome signature for taf6δ, establish the relationship of the taf6δ signature with those of taf9/taf9b, and identify a functional and physical interaction of taf6δ with p <dig> 

RESULTS
the taf6δ orchestrates a pro-apoptotic gene expression program
to establish the impact of taf6δ on global gene expression patterns, the expression of the endogenous taf6δ splice variant was experimentally induced using splice-switching oligonucleotides  as previously documented  <cit> . the hela cell line was chosen as a model system for transcriptome studies for three principle reasons. firstly, these cells are readily transfectable and produce a robust apoptotic response to taf6δ-inducing sso  <cit> . secondly, the taf6δ cdna was cloned from a hela cell library  <cit>  and therefore these cells provide a natural cellular context. thirdly, hela cells express no detectable taf6δ protein under standard culture conditions  <cit> , thus these cells provide a stringently inducible model for sso studies. to define the impact of taf6δ expression on transcriptome dynamics we took advantage of an experimental approach that combines sso treatment with high sensitivity microarray analysis  <cit> . we note that to achieve the statistically significant overrepresentation of gene ontology pathways reported here it was necessary to employ optimized sso sequences designed to more efficiently induce taf6δ expression than those employed in a previous study  <cit> . the improved sso were transfected into hela cells and the induction of endogenous taf6δ mrna and protein was confirmed, as shown in additional file  <dig>  total rna was isolated  <dig> hours post-transfection and subjected to microarray analysis as previously detailed  <cit> . biological triplicates were performed with sso t6- <dig> and, as a control to normalize for any non-specific sso effects, a scrambled oligonucleotide . the statistical analysis and filtering of the raw microarray data was carried out as previously described  <cit>  to identify significantly  regulated mrnas.

the induction of endogenous taf6δ resulted in significant changes in the levels of  <dig> probes corresponding to  <dig> independent genes of  <dig>  . remarkably,  <dig> % of the mrnas significantly changed by taf6δ are upregulated and only  <dig> % are downregulated . these data are consistent with previous results obtained with a less efficient sso in the hct- <dig> cell line  <cit>  and further demonstrate that taf6δ acts primarily as a positive regulator of gene expression. the data also rule out the possibility that taf6δ-induced cell death is a result of a global reduction in mrna transcription. to validate the taf6δ transcriptome signature we selected  <dig> genes  for quantitative rt-pcr confirmation. gene expression changes measured by real-time rt-pcr for the  <dig> genes showed a strong correlation with changes measured by microarray analysis . to further confirm the specificity of the taf6δ transcriptome signature we employed a distinct taf <dig> targeting antisense oligonucleotide , whose binding to the taf <dig> pre-mrna is shifted five nucleotides downstream with respect to sso t6- <dig>  sso t6- <dig> is slightly more efficient in inducing endogenous taf6δ than sso t6- <dig> . real-time rt-pcr shows that like sso t6- <dig>  sso t6- <dig> also altered the expression of the same  <dig> taf6δ target genes . the above data confirm that the microarray results provide an accurate and reproducible measure of the taf6δ-controlled transcriptome landscape.

to examine the specificity of the taf6δ-induced transcriptome signature, we compared the microarray data with those obtained when the pro-apoptotic isoform of a distinct gene, bcl-x, was induced by sso under identical conditions  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig>  the transcriptome signatures resulting from the induction of taf6δ and bcl-xs are highly distinct. the vast majority of taf6δ-regulated transcripts  were induced while bcl-xs expression results in a majority of transcripts being repressed . only a minor fraction  of the  <dig> genes upregulated by taf6δ was also upregulated by bcl-xs. of the small number of transcripts repressed  by taf6δ,  <dig> are also repressed by bcl-xs, possibly reflecting a minor subset of genes that are repressed by both of these pro-apoptotic pathways. the portion of bcl-xs repressed genes also repressed by taf6δ was minor . the fact that genes induced by taf6δ share little overlap with those induced by bcl-xs underscores the highly specific impact of the taf6δ-inducing sso on the transcriptome.

to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic capacity of taf6δ, we performed gene ontology analysis to identify pathways that are statistically overrepresented within the microarray data . of  <dig> cellular pathways surveyed, those that are statistically  overrepresented in the taf6δ data set are the notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p <dig>  apoptosis and p <dig> pathway feedback loops  <dig> pathways . genes in the angiogenesis pathway were also overrepresented  in the taf6δ-induced gene pool. the taf6δ-regulated genes found in the overrepresented pathways are shown in additional file  <dig>  we next postulated that if the pathways activated by taf6δ represent a physiologically coherent response, then the functional connections between these pathways would not be random. we therefore performed a statistical analysis to identify pathways that share two or more genes activated by taf6δ at frequencies higher than those expected in a random sample. statistically significant  overrepresentation of shared genes between the integrin and angiogenesis pathways, as well as between the p <dig> and integrin pathways was observed . to provide a visual framework that depicts the interconnections between the overrepresented pathways they were mapped onto cellular signaling networks using the pajek algorithm  <cit> . this global view reveals that the activated pathways are not randomly distributed and moreover that there is a network of interconnections between taf6δ-regulated pathways, as seen by black points at which distinct colored lines intersect . taken together, the results above define a specific taf6δ-driven transcriptome landscape that includes the induction of genes in the notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p <dig>  apoptosis, p <dig> pathway feedback loops  <dig> and angiogenesis pathways.

to determine whether or not the changes in mrna expression in response to taf6δ expression result also in changes in protein levels we selected representative proteins from the taf6δ transcriptome signature for verification by immunoblotting experiments. the microarray data showed expression of arnt mrna was repressed by taf6δ, and immunoblotting showed the corresponding arnt protein levels also decreased in response to taf6δ-inducing sso . the levels of the transcription factor tbp were tested as a control for specificity and remained relatively constant in response to taf6δ . the levels of fos, jun, hes <dig>  cdkn2b , and pmaip <dig>  were assayed and taf6δ expression resulted in increased protein levels that paralleled increased mrna levels detected in the microarray experiments in each case . importantly, bcl-x sso treatment did not result in comparable changes of protein levels, showing the specificity of their response to taf6δ expression . these data demonstrate that for the proteins tested the impact of taf6δ on gene expression programs occurs at both the mrna and protein levels, including the induction of the known pro-apoptotic protein pmaip <dig>   <cit> .

changes in mrna levels detected by microarray analysis can in principle result from a number of effects including alterations in mrna stability. to obtain evidence that taf6δ can regulate gene expression in a promoter-dependent and promoter-specific fashion, we tested the ability of endogenous taf6δ to increase target gene expression in luciferase reporter gene assays. we selected four promoters for analysis. the hes <dig>  dusp <dig> and adm promoters were selected since the endogenous hes <dig>  dusp <dig> and adm mrna levels are induced in response to taf6δ expression . in the case of hes <dig>  the levels of endogenous hes <dig> protein were also shown to be induced in response to taf6δ expression . the  <dig> selected genes act in several of the pathways activated by taf6δ including the notch   <cit> , angiogenesis   <cit> , oxidative stress and p <dig> pathways   <cit> . the bax promoter was also included because it is a p53-responsive and pro-apoptotic gene  <cit> , yet is not induced by taf6δ. the induction of taf6δ in hela cells resulted in increased hes <dig>  dusp <dig>  and adm promoter-driven gene expression . in contrast, the bax promoter was not induced and even measurably repressed . these results demonstrate that endogenous taf6δ can act directly or indirectly to stimulate transcription in a promoter-dependent manner.

the taf6δ transcriptome signature is not equivalent to those resulting from depletion of taf <dig> and/or taf9b
the only currently known functional distinction between pro-apoptotic taf6δ and taf6α is that taf6δ cannot interact with taf <dig> or taf9b. we therefore analyzed the extent to which the transcription footprints resulting from taf6δ induction resembles those reported following the depletion of taf <dig> and/or taf9b by treatment with sirnas in hela cells  <cit> . after mapping of the previous microarray data to enable comparison with our current microarray platform , the datasets were co-filtered to compare transcriptome changes. of the  <dig> taf6δ-dependent mrnas selected for comparative analysis,  <dig> mrnas could be mapped between the datasets . a global view of the magnitude of the changes for these  <dig> genes showed that changes in response to taf6δ induction were more pronounced than those resulting from taf9/taf9b depletion as depicted by heat maps .  <dig> mrnas that are statistically significantly regulated by taf <dig> and/or taf9b were found within the taf6δ-regulated transcripts . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> showed regulation by both taf <dig> and taf9b.  <dig> showed regulation by taf <dig> alone and  <dig> showed regulation by taf9b alone . to probe for communalities between taf6δ, taf <dig> and taf9b-controlled transcriptomes, pathway analysis was performed on the genes regulated by taf6δ and taf <dig> as well as genes regulated by taf6δ, taf <dig>  and taf9b. the only pathway that was statistically significantly overrepresented in these subsets was the "p <dig> feedback loop 2" ontology . pathway analysis was also performed on the taf9b-dependent gene set alone. interestingly, the only pathway that was overrepresented was angiogenesis, a pathway also overrepresented in the taf6δ transcriptome signature . finally, we compared the effects of taf6δ, taf <dig>  and taf9b on single genes from the subset of  <dig> genes that respond to changes in the expression all of taf6δ, taf <dig>  and taf9b. a majority of genes  had comparable changes in response to taf6δ induction and taf <dig> or taf9b depletion of which  <dig> examples are shown in figure 4d. in contrast, approximately 20% of the taf6δ- taf9- and taf9b-dependent genes were positively regulated by taf6δ induction whereas taf <dig> or taf9b depletion resulted in their suppression . taken together the analysis shows that taf6δ induction has both overlapping and unique impacts on the transcriptome, when compared to taf <dig> and/or taf9b depletion.

taf6δ interacts physically and functionally with p53
taf6α is known to interact with the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein , but whether the pro-apoptotic taf6δ isoform could retain the capacity to interact with p <dig> is unknown. our previous work demonstrated that taf6δ induces apoptosis independently of p <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the current transcriptome data show that taf6δ induces the expression of several p <dig> target genes . we therefore investigated the capacity of taf6δ to interact with p <dig>  recombinant histidine tagged taf6δ was produced in bacteria and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. gst tagged p <dig> was produced and immobilized on glutathione-sepharose beads. purified recombinant taf6δ and taf6α were assayed for their capacities to interact with immobilized gst-p <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> , taf6α bound efficiently to gst-p <dig> . terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase  served as a control for specificity and did not bind to gst-p <dig> . purified his-taf6δ was efficiently retained by gst-p <dig> , but not by gst alone . resistance to high ionic strength buffers can provide a measure of the strength of protein-protein interactions. we therefore challenged the p53-taf <dig> interactions with  <dig> mm kcl washes and found that the interactions were stable in high salt conditions . these data show a direct and selective interaction between taf6δ and p <dig> in vitro.

to determine whether the taf6δ-p <dig> interaction can occur in living cells we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. as endogenous taf6δ is highly labile and expressed at very low levels  <cit> , taf6δ was expressed by transfection of an expression vector into hct- <dig> p <dig> -/- cells. exogenous p <dig> was provided by co-transfection of an expression vector. immunoprecipitation of taf6δ resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of p <dig> , in contrast to the negative control immunoprecipitation of tubulin . in addition, the reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation of p <dig> resulted in recovery of taf6δ . together, these data show that the interaction between taf6δ and p <dig> can occur in the cellular context.

we next sought to determine whether the interaction between taf6δ and p <dig> has functional consequences. we took advantage of the fact that the dusp <dig> promoter is activated by taf6δ  and is also activated by p <dig>  <cit> . a reporter construct expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the dusp <dig> promoter was co-transfected with p <dig> expression vectors, as well as vectors expressing taf <dig> variants. taf6δ transfection resulted in enhanced dusp <dig> expression when co-transfected with p <dig> . a truncated version of taf <dig> that lacks pro-apoptotic activity  <cit>  failed to show significant co-activation . the protein levels resulting from transfected plasmids were determined by immunoblotting experiments and are shown in additional file  <dig>  the data exclude the possibility that higher levels of taf6δ protein  contribute to the activation levels observed. these data show for the first time that taf6δ can interact functionally with p <dig> to co-activate dusp <dig> gene transcription.

having established that taf6δ can interact functionally with p <dig>  we next sought to define the role of this interaction with endogenous taf6δ and p <dig>  moreover we sought to define the potential crosstalk of taf6δ with p <dig> upon endogenous genes and at the transcriptome-wide level. we therefore revisited microarray data derived from either wild-type hct- <dig> or their p <dig> negative counterpart hct- <dig> p <dig> -/- in which endogenous taf6δ expression was induced by sso  to test for transcriptional crosstalk between taf6δ and p <dig>  we re-filtered the data specifically to determine the influence of taf6δ versus taf6α on p53-dependent genes. the effects of taf <dig> isoforms are illustrated in figure 6a, and reveal three classes of genes. importantly, 20% of p53-regulated genes  change only in the presence of taf6δ . 53% of the p53-regulated genes change specifically in the presence of taf6α, for example tnfrsf10c and chia . 25% of p53-regulated genes, such as fas and angpt <dig>  change expression in the presence of both taf6δ and taf6α . the data show that the expression of taf6δ versus taf6α can dictate the outcome of p53-mediated transcriptional signals.

we also filtered the data to determine the reciprocal influence of p <dig> status upon previously identified taf6δ-dependent mrnas  <cit> . 51% of the taf6δ-regulated mrnas changed significantly only in the absence of p <dig> , for example tnfrsf6b . 9% of the taf6δ-regulated mrnas changed independently of p <dig> status, including acrc . 40% of taf6δ-regulated mrnas changed significantly only in cells expressing p <dig>  such as tp53i <dig> . in general the influence of p <dig> on taf6δ-dependent transcription was relatively subtle in magnitude, with at least one exception where the gene loc <dig> displayed opposing regulation in presence or absence of p <dig> . together, the above data establish reciprocal transcriptional crosstalk between the taf6δ and p <dig> proteins.

discussion
the taf6δ pathway has emerged as an apoptotic signaling hub  <cit> , yet the mechanisms by which taf6δ promotes apoptosis have remained unknown. here we provide a transcriptome-wide microarray analysis that defines the impact of endogenous taf6δ induction on gene expression patterns. the taf6δ transcriptome footprint showed a predominant role for taf6δ in the activation of gene expression, with approximately 90% of taf6δ-regulated mrnas being induced. genes annotated as belonging to apoptotic pathways were found to be statistically overrepresented in the taf6δ-induced genes. the data therefore provide experimental support for a model wherein taf6δ initiates the apoptotic cascade by inducing pro-apoptotic gene expression. examples of apoptotic taf6δ-induced genes identified include noxa and fdxr  that both code for proteins that each alone possess pro-apoptotic activity, are p <dig> target genes, and localize to the mitochondria  <cit> . as taf6δ induces the expression of hundreds of genes, including established pro-apoptotic genes, we propose a model whereby taf6δ represents a signaling hub that transduces apoptotic stimuli to redirect the transcriptional machinery to tip the balance from an anti- to a pro-apoptotic program .

in addition to apoptotic genes the unbiased statistical analysis of our microarray data revealed overrepresentation of genes in the notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p <dig>  p <dig> pathway feedback loops  <dig>  and angiogenesis pathways. the taf6δ pathway is an orphan pathway whose molecular trigger remains unknown. the novel links between these pathways and taf6δ expression provide testable hypotheses for the potential physiological triggers and functions of taf6δ. for example, the identification of p <dig> target genes prompted us to test and demonstrate a physical interaction between taf6δ and p <dig> . within the taf6δ-activated transcriptome signature, unbiased statistical approach showed significant overrepresented interconnections between these individual signaling pathways . additional support for functional interconnections amongst taf6δ-associated pathways comes from interactions documented in the literature. for example, the notch  <cit>  and integrin  <cit>  pathways both play important roles in angiogenesis. the fact that several of the taf6δ-induced pathways converge upon the process of angiogenesis implies a physiological coherent impact of taf6δ on gene expression programs. interestingly, many of the pathways associated with taf6δ expression play roles in the tumor progression. for example, angiogenesis is both a key event in tumor progression and a target for anti-cancer therapies  <cit> . our study therefore provides the rationale to initiate studies to test the impact of taf6δ on the process of angiogenesis in vivo in the future.

the incorporation of taf6δ into taf-containing complexes results in the formation of tfiidπ that lacks taf <dig> . the currently available evidence is consistent with the lack of taf <dig> being the only difference between canonical tfiid complexes and tfiidπ  <cit> , however it is conceivable that the inclusion of taf6δ could cause as yet unknown changes in tfiidπ subunit composition. taf <dig> interacts with taf <dig> and the resulting dimeric complex can bind to downstream promoter elements   <cit> . to date our analysis of taf6δ-responsive promoters has revealed no statistically significant enrichment of dpes or any of the known core promoter element within the promoter regions of genes induced by taf6δ . one mechanistic explanation for the transcriptome impact of taf6δ could be that the loss of taf <dig> or taf9b from tfiid alone drives transcriptional changes. a prediction of this model is that the transcriptome signatures resulting from depletion of taf <dig> and/or taf9b by small interfering rnas would be highly similar to that resulting from induction of taf6δ. the comparative transcriptomic analysis we provide shows both overlapping and unique features of the taf6δ versus taf9/taf9b-dependent transcriptomes. interestingly, taf9b-depletion, like taf6δ induction resulted in transcriptome profile with overrepresentation of genes functioning in angiogenesis pathways. gene ontology analysis of the genes regulated by all of taf6δ, taf <dig> and taf9b showed an overrepresentation of a single ontology termed the p <dig> feedback loops  <dig> pathway, suggesting overlap in the gene expression programs controlled by these tafs. a limitation of the current study is that the distinct approaches  and microarray platforms employed results in the loss of information. nevertheless, clear differences were observed between the transcriptome profiles of taf6δ versus taf <dig> and taf9b . we conclude that exclusion of taf <dig> and/or taf9b from tfiid results in transcriptome changes that share certain targets with, but that do not fully recapitulate the taf6δ transcriptome signature.

the current transcriptome analysis showed that taf6δ induces genes in the p <dig> pathway, a result not revealed by previous transcriptome analysis of taf6δ in hct- <dig> cells  <cit> . based on the finding that taf6δ and p <dig> can share target genes, we tested and confirmed the direct physical and functional interaction of taf6δ with p <dig>  the impact of endogenous taf6δ on p53-dependent gene expression was further demonstrated at the transcriptome-wide level. the reciprocal capacity of endogenous p <dig> to influence taf6δ-mediated transcription was also detected, although the magnitude of these effects was globally more modest. taken together, the data show that there is reciprocal crosstalk between the taf6δ and p <dig> pathways. the microarray experiments measure changes in expression resulting from both direct and indirect effects of taf6δ and p <dig>  therefore, the crosstalk we have documented includes that resulting from the direct taf6δ- p <dig> but also that resulting from indirect transcriptional changes. given the previous demonstration that taf6δ can induce apoptosis independent of p <dig>  <cit> , we conclude that taf6δ possesses both p <dig> independent and p <dig> dependent activities.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report here that the transcriptome landscape orchestrated by taf6δ includes the induction of apoptotic gene expression. the transcriptome data further uncovered novel links between taf6δ expression and the notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p <dig>  p <dig> feedback loop  <dig>  and angiogenesis pathways. the taf6δ-controlled transcriptome landscape was shown not to be equivalent to those resulting from depletion of taf <dig> and/or taf9b. finally, the data establish a physical and functional interaction between taf6δ and the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein.
