BACKGROUND
the depiction of interactions between genes, proteins and metabolites as networks has uncovered unexpected similarities in the organization of various biological networks, indicating that generic principles and mechanics give rise to their structure. although such networks vary extensively in their complexity, corroborative evidence points to a series of simple organizing principles that characterize all complex networks. the most dramatic is the scale-free nature of these networks, a remarkable inhomogeneity that highlights a small number of highly connected nodes which secure the networks integrity  <cit> . the special role such proteins play for the stability of protein interaction networks is further indicated by their significant propensity to be simultaneously essential as well as evolutionary conserved  <cit> . reflecting their inherent cohesive nature, complex networks are characterized by the accumulation of discernible modules. such clusters of densely interconnected nodes combine in an overlapping manner, share well defined functions and hubs as the modules connectors  <cit> . similarly to hubs, cohesively bound motifs of protein networks are frequently conserved as a whole, suggesting their role as evolutionary relevant units  <cit> . while these findings allowed spectacular insights into the inner workings of a cell, biological networks are generally not only determined by their layout of links. in fact, we expect that the heterogeneity in the utilization of connections has a major impact on the organization of cellular activities as well. recently, attention turned to weighted scientific collaborations and airways networks  <cit> , allowing a first insight into the intricate interplay between links and their weights. concluding, analysis of real world networks indicate that the static grid of links and their weights can not be regarded as separate entities. here, we present a first statistical analysis of a weighted biological network by considering a web of pfam domain interactions. each link between domains is weighted by an expectation score, reflecting the probability that a particular domain interaction indeed gives rise to observed protein interactions. applying metrics that combine the static layout of interactions and their weights, we observe that the patterns of correlations are similar for weighted and unweighted network parameters. in contrast to other real world networks, we find weak signals that do not support an entanglement of static grid and weights of domain interactions, allowing us to confirm that a protein interactions are largely governed by single domain interactions.

assuming that pairs of interacting proteins in s. cerevisiae and d. melanogaster are indeed dominated by the highest scoring domain interaction their domain architectures suggest, we find that the confidence score of a protein interaction correlates well with its highest scoring domain interaction. as an application, this observation indicates a simple method to model interactions between proteins of the human malaria parasite p. falciparum. assuming an interaction between proteins if we find at least one high scoring domain interaction we predict  <dig>   <dig> novel protein interactions among  <dig> proteins. the quality of each predicted interaction is assessed by a logistic regression model, allowing us to uncover reliable interactions between proteins that share similar functions and are preferably conserved in evolution.

RESULTS
as a source of high quality interaction data of protein domains we utilized the results of a recent study by riley et al.  <cit> . in this statistical approach, called domain pair exclusion analysis , a likelihood ratio test is applied to assess the contribution of each potential pfam-a and pfam-b domain  <cit>  interaction to the likelihood of a set of observed protein interactions as of dip  <cit> . applying a statistical framework which evaluates the confidence that domains i and j indeed interact, the authors obtain a network of  <dig>   <dig> domains that are embedded in a web of  <dig>   <dig> interactions. weighting each interaction by its probability score – the expectation value  <cit>  – we are primarily interested in the interplay between topology and the reliability of the underlying interactions.

allowing a first insight in the weights role, we observe a heavy tail in the cumulative distribution of the expectation value of domain links e, which can be roughly approximated by a power-law  ~ e- <dig> ) . in real world networks the correlation of the degree product kikj and the weight wij follows a power-law shaped curve, potentially indicating an intricate relationship between the static layout and weights of links. in our case, we hardly find such a dependence . in fact, the mean expectation value is almost constant for more than two decades, indicating a general lack of correlation between weights and the domains number of interaction partners  <cit> 

investigating further if the topology of the underlying domain interaction network and their weights are indeed independent from each other, we combine both topology and weights by a series of measures that enable a more significant assessment of the impact of weights  <cit> . in an unweighted domain interaction network, the domains degree is defined as ki = ∑jaij where aij =  <dig> if there exists a link between domains i and j. extending this definition, the strength of a domain i is defined as

accounting for individual expectation values eij as weights of interactions of domain i. comparing the statistical properties of a domains degree k and its strength s we observe that their frequency distributions follow a generalized zipf's law p = α × -γ  <cit> . the power-law tail of the degree distribution indicates the presence of scale-free topology  <cit> , suggesting that the integrity of the underlying network basically depends on a small subset of highly connected nodes. analogously, there exists a majority of nodes having low strength while a minority of nodes reach high levels of strength. a list of highest interacting domains shows prominent protagonists that are responsible for important cellular functions such as signaling and cell-cell contacts . in particular, we observe that highly connected domains such as pkinase, rrm <dig> or zinc finger c2h <dig> also pool a lot of strength, indicating a proportionality between high level of interactions and their strength.

investigating the local cohesiveness of network areas, the unweighted representation of the clustering coeffcient ci measures the degree of cohesiveness around a particular domain i  <cit> . the dependence of the average clustering coeffcient c from the domains degree k recovers further information about the structure of the underlying network. in most real world networks c exhibits a highly nontrivial behavior as exemplified by a power-law decay with increasing degree k. averaging over the clustering coeffcients of domains with a certain degree k, we find this particular signature, indicating the presence of a nested hierarchy of modules  <cit>  . accounting for weights, barrat et al.  <cit>  extended the initial definition of the clustering coeffcient to combine topological information with weights of network links. considering the expectation value of each domain interactions e as the weight of links, we define the weighted clustering coeffcient as

another measure that allows insights in the relationship of network layout and weights are degree-degree correlations. similarly to cw, we define the average weighted nearest-neighbors degree as  <cit> 



in an unweighted network the definition of knn,i recovers the average nearest neighbor degree of a node, where knn,i=1ki∑jaijkj

the previously introduced topological measures of both unweighted and weighted representations of the same domain interaction network share the same qualitative features, suggesting that weights and topology are entangled entities. however, recalling the observation that the degree product does not correlate with the links underlying weights casts doubt on this assumption. further insights into a potential interplay of topology and utilization of domain interactions arise from correlations between a domains degree and strength . despite the existence of inevitable fluctuations, the dependence of the strength from the degree of a domain in the underlying domain interaction network shows a clear and significant power-law s ~ kβ with β=  <dig> , allowing us to conclude that topology and utilization of links in domain interaction networks are separate entities since independent weights and connectivities would lead to an exponent β=  <dig>  <cit> . we receive further support of this hypothesis by the disparity value y <dig>  a measure that quantifies biased distributions, defined as

where Γ is the set of neighbors of domain i. in figure 2b we observe a clear power-law in the dependence of the disparity value y <dig> from the degree k, y <dig> ~ k- <dig> . similarly to the dependence of the strength from the degree , an exponent close to  <dig> suggests that the expectation values of domain interactions are distributed in an uncorrelated manner  <cit> .

the absence of any correlations between the structure of the web of domain interactions and their confidence suggests that domain interactions hardly interfere with each other. as a consequence, protein interactions are primarily governed by a single domain interaction. indeed, a recent survey of protein interactions uncovered a rate of 94% that protein interactions are determined by a single pairwise domain interaction  <cit>  while protein interactions that involve interactions between two or more domains are hardly found. a high e reflects the probability that the domains in question indeed interact while a low eij suggests that other potential domain interactions are roughly as good at explaining the observed protein interactions  <cit> . therefore, we assume that a protein interaction is governed by the domain interaction with the highest expectation value. in order to uncover a potential correlation between the quality of a particular protein interaction and the highest scoring domain interaction, we utilize two well curated sets of protein interactions in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and d. melanogaster  <cit>  where each interaction is evaluated by a confidence score. utilizing information about the domain composition of proteins as of the integr <dig> database, we screen each domain pair that is suggested by the domain architectures of the underlying proteins. provided these pairs indeed map to high scoring domain interactions, each protein interaction is assumed to be governed by the domain interaction with highest expectation score. applied to the evaluated protein interaction sets of s. cerevisae and d. melanogaster, we observe a strong and significant correlation between an interactions confidence and the expectation value of the underlying highest scoring domain interaction . in turn, we can potentially use the previous conclusion that the absence of correlations between interactions and their probability indicates the dominance of single domain interactions as a means to infer protein interactions. as an organism, we chose the human malaria parasite p. falciparum. utilizing domain information from the integr <dig> database we annotate plasmodium proteins with their corresponding pfam domains. in order to avoid interactions between proteins that appear in different compartments we additionally assign each protein with its cellular component terms as of the go slim database  <cit> . considering all protein pairs of plasmodium we select those that share at least one go slim term. the domain architectures of candidate protein pairs are screened for domain pairs that have at least one high scoring domain interaction. in case we find more than one high scoring domain interaction, we choose the highest scoring one, according to the statistical argument that domain interactions with higher expectation score have a better chance to explain the underlying protein interaction. in figure 3a, we give a schematic survey of the procedure. applying this method to the proteome of p. falciparum we find  <dig>   <dig> interactions between  <dig> proteins . in order to evaluate each of these potential protein interactions, we characterize each link by measures that reflect biological significance. in particular, we are interested in parameters that are independent of the initial assumption that the highest scoring domain interaction indeed can be used to predict protein interactions. as such, we choose co-expression correlation values of interacting proteins, since similar expression profiles tend to indicate interacting proteins. for p. falciparum, we utilized gene expression data over  <dig> time points. compiling gene expression data derived from micro-array analysis  <cit> , we determine pearson's correlation coeffcients rp of each interaction . in addition, we calculated hypergeometric clustering coeffcients cvw for each interaction, a topological measure that reflects local cohesiveness around a certain link and strongly correlates with the quality of the underlying protein interaction  <cit>  . combining these measures, we utilized a logistic regression method  trained by carefully selected sets of  <dig> true positive and  <dig> negative interactions, allowing us to assess the quality of each interaction by a confidence score between  <dig> and  <dig> . as a quality measure of the utilized training sets, we performed a leave-one-out strategy, allowing us to obtain 95% accuracy.

binning interactions according to their confidence value, we observe that about half of the interactions have an elevated degree of confidence . in each bin, we averaged the expectation score of the domain interactions and observe that high quality of protein interactions – as exemplified by high confidence – are strongly linked to high expectation scores of the underlying domain interaction . supported by significant correlation values, this observation is a confirmation of our original assumption that protein interactions are dominated by the highest scoring domain interactions, while high scoring domain interactions indicate the presence of a potential protein interaction. as additional measures of quality, we make use of the well known fact that protein interactions occur between proteins of similar function  <cit> . as a measure of functional homogeneity of interacting proteins, we apply a hypergeometric test  of the distributions of the proteins go terms  <cit> . in particular, this statistical measure reflects the probability that go terms of interacting proteins have been distributed randomly. averaging over all interaction specific values in each bin, we find a strong and significant correlation, confirming that protein interactions of increasing confidence tend to occur between functionally related proteins . as a final test, we wondered if the predicted protein interactions in p. falciparum have an evolutionary signature. in particular, we utilized three protein interaction sets of the organisms s. cerevisiae  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit>  and h. sapiens  <cit> . utilizing orthologous protein information from the inparanoid database  <cit> , we sampled all protein interactions in each organisms that have a fully conserved counterpart – an interolog  <cit>  – in the predicted set of interactions of p. falciparum. in figure 5c, we observe that especially predictions with high confidence pool most of the found interologs in each organism, strongly indicating the reliability of our predictions.

we compared the predicted sets of interactions to a recently published set of experimentally determined protein interactions of p. falciparum  <cit> . although many interactions of this set have been assigned potential protein domain interactions, the utilized domain information does not overlap strongly with pfam, restricting the overlap with our predicted set to only  <dig> interactions. in particular, we find self interactions of the hypothetical plasmodium proteins pfl0275w and pf10_ <dig>  in the first case, a self interaction of the fha domain gives rise to the observed protein interaction, while a self interaction of chromo domain determines the latter one. in both cases, the interacting proteins are hypothetical, meaning that their function is unclear. however, the fact that we found domain interactions suggests a role for these proteins. in particular, the forkhead-associated fha domain is a phosphopeptide recognition domain found in many regulatory proteins, while the chromo  domain is a conserved region of around  <dig> amino acids involved in the alteration of the structure of chromatin. putatively, pfl0275w is involved in regulatory activities while pf10_ <dig> might play a role in chromatin remodeling. in general, our predictions show a prevalence of functions revolving around the proteasome, spliceosome and ribosome. in particular, table  <dig> ranks the domain interactions that gave rise to the highest number of predictions in p. falciparum. in particular, we observe that domain interactions between the rna recognition motif rrm <dig>  proteasome and lsm domains appear among the most prevalent domain interactions. as the previous examples illustrates, many interactions are related to self interactions of the underlying domains. as such, we observe a total of  <dig> self interactions. indeed, it is well known that multi-protein complexes contain homo-dimers including proteasome  <cit> , ribosome  <cit>  and spliceosome  <cit> . in particular, rrm's are found in a variety of rna binding proteins, including various hnrnp proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snrnps. the lsm domain contains sm proteins as well as other related lsm  proteins. the u <dig>  u <dig>  u4/u <dig>  and u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles  involved in pre-mrna splicing contain seven sm proteins in common, which assemble around the sm site present in four of the major spliceosomal small nuclear rnas. the u <dig> snrnp binds to the lsm  proteins. the proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex that is involved in an atp/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. in eukaryotes, the proteasome is composed of about  <dig> distinct subunits, which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure . concluding, in the proteasome, ribosome and spliceosome proteins which carry those domains tend to shape stable structures which are mostly governed by self domain interactions, validating the presence of self interactions in our predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
assessing the statistical characteristics of a weighted domain interaction network we show that the confidence as exemplified by the expectation value of domain interactions is far from being evenly distributed. characterizing the underlying weighted domain interactions network, we observe that weighted and unweighted measures of topology follow the same trends. despite these observations we do not find any significant proof that topology and weights in the domain interaction network are necessarily dependent from each other. in fact, correlations between strength and connectivity as well as disparity suggest that weights as exemplified by the expectation score of each domain interaction are randomly distributed, allowing us to  treat the static layout of links and their weights as separate entities and  conclude that protein interactions are indeed governed by a single protein domain interaction  <cit> .

the presence of highly reliable domain interactions offers potential new ways for the prediction and evaluation of protein interactions. in particular, we observe a correlation between an elevated confidence level of a protein interaction in yeast and fly and an increase in the reliability of the underlying domain interactions. as an application, we propose a novel method for the inference of potential protein interactions. while this method can be applied to the prediction of protein interactions in any organism for which pfam annotation of the organisms proteome is available, we chose the human malaria parasite p. falciparum. screening through all pairs of proteins that provide at least one high scoring domain interaction, we sample potential candidates. here, we stress that the determination of a high scoring domain interaction has been used as a preselection step of potential protein interaction candidates. in order to evaluate each interaction we resort to interaction specific parameters that are independent from the underlying domain interactions. we find interactions between proteins, that not only show an elevated degree of functional similarity and evolutionary conservation, but also validate our assumption that high scoring domain interactions indeed give rise to reliable interactions. predominately, we find an enrichment of protein interactions caused by domain interactions that represent functions in the ribosome, proteasome and spliceosome. as reported in protein complexes in other eukaryotes, these functions emphasize a considerable amount of self interactions, we also find in our predictions.

comparing with existing experimental data sets, we only find a minimal overlap, caused by the fact that many proteins of p. falciparum currently are not annotated with pfam domains. on the other hand, experimental determination of protein interactions in p. falciparum is in its starting phase covering about a quarter of known proteins. as such, our predictions can help focus experimental studies on specific interactions unique to this pathogen.
