BACKGROUND
copy number variation , involving a deletion or duplication of a region of dna ≥1 kb in length, is a common feature of the human genome
. at some loci, recurrent deletion and duplication events lead to a region being present in a highly variable number of copies; these are referred to as multiallelic copy number variants. multiallelic cnv has been associated with a variety of disease phenotypes
. however, an increase in copy number does not always result in increased mrna levels and, in turn, an increased protein production
 <cit> . in these circumstances, the knowledge of the structure of the locus can be essential for understanding the effect of cnv on phenotype. for example, in the case of the association of low fcgr3b copy number with systemic lupus erythematosus , it is the presence of a zero-copy fcgr3b haplotype, which leads to aberrant expression of a chimeric gene, fcgr2b’, in natural killer cells, that may be the key factor in an increased sle risk, and not a reduced dosage of fcgr3b
 <cit> . therefore, understanding the effect of copy number variation on phenotype comes from not only knowing the copy number of a region, but the spatial arrangement of the locus.

one locus exhibiting multiallelic cnv is the α-defensin defa1a <dig> locus on human chromosome 8p <dig>  
, with individuals having between 3– <dig> copies of defa1a3
. snps are usually poor tags of copy number at multiallelic loci, due to the limited ability of a biallelic snp to tag multiple different copy number states
 <cit> . however, the snp rs <dig> has been identified as a tag of defa1a <dig> copy number in populations with european ancestry, an association which has not been shown in other populations
 <cit> . at the locus, each defa1a <dig> repeat unit can be occupied by one of two α-defensin genes, either defa <dig> or defa <dig>  adding additional complexity. the two genes encode the human neutrophil peptides  1–3; these are antimicrobial peptides involved in the innate immune response
. a recent gwas found the snp rs <dig>  which falls within the same linkage disequilibrium block as defa1a <dig>  to be associated with risk of iga nephropathy in the han chinese population
 <cit> . the basis of this association is unknown, but highlights a need to understand how variation at the defa1a <dig> locus influences hnp1- <dig> expression. there has only been a single small-scale study comparing defa1a <dig> copy number with hnp1- <dig> expression, which identified a positive correlation
 <cit> . however, the spatial arrangement of the locus may influence expression.figure  <dig> 
structure of the

locus. a) the defa1a <dig> locus consists of two single-copy partial repeats surrounding a variable number of full repeats. each of the full repeats and the centromeric partial repeat contain a gene locus occupied by either defa <dig> or defa <dig>  symbols show the positions of the variant distinguishing defa <dig> from defa <dig>  a 7 bp duplication in intron  <dig> of each copy of defa1a <dig> and a 5 bp indel located upstream of each copy of defa1a <dig>  the positions of the four snps tagging defa1a <dig> haplotype class are shown. adapted from khan et al. <cit> . b) there are snps either side of the defa1a <dig> locus displaying high levels of linkage disequilibrium , as shown by phased snp genotype data for the hapmap ceu <dig> individuals, downloaded from the hapmap project 
 <cit> . d’ values are shown.



non-allelic homologous recombination  is the predominant mechanism through which multiallelic copy number variants are formed, requiring segmental duplications  of ≥10 kb in length with ≥95% sequence identity to mediate the rearrangements
 <cit> . nahr is a type of homologous recombination occurring between non-allelic copies of a region in different chromosomal positions, resulting in deletions and duplications and can lead to either gene conversion or chromosomal crossover
. however, there are snps either side of the defa1a <dig> locus that display high levels of linkage disequilibrium  . this suggests that crossover events across the defa1a <dig> region are rare, despite its high variability in copy number. in addition, it is unclear what features of the defa1a <dig> locus are shared between related haplotypes- for example, are haplotypes with the same defa1a <dig> copy number more closely related than haplotypes with different defa1a <dig> copy numbers? therefore, the mechanisms responsible for generating variation at the defa1a <dig> locus are unclear.

in this study, flanking sequence variation was used to identify related haplotypes at the defa1a <dig> locus, in order to determine the shared features of these haplotypes, such as defa1a <dig> copy number. previously, we have demonstrated that emulsion haplotype fusion pcr  can be used to determine the relative positions of the defa <dig> and defa <dig> genes across a haplotype, providing spatial information at the defa1a <dig> locus
 <cit> . this technique has now been applied to a larger number of haplotypes and to additional variants within the defa1a <dig> locus to generate more detailed structural haplotypes, allowing an inference of the mechanisms responsible for changes in defa1a <dig> copy number. this has provided a comprehensive understanding of the common allelic structures of the defa1a <dig> locus present in populations with european ancestry.

RESULTS
gene conversion events at defa1a3
our analysis of array-cgh data from conrad et al.
 <cit>  appeared to identify a deletion polymorphism in the telomeric partial repeat of the defa1a <dig> locus. further investigation in this study has demonstrated that this is not a deletion, but a replacement of the defa1a <dig> telomeric partial repeat sequence with sequence from the equivalent region of the defa1a <dig> full repeats, in a gene conversion event. this is the “telomeric replacement polymorphism” . the telomeric boundary of the replacement is within the interval grch37/hg <dig> chr8: 6825864– <dig> and the centromeric boundary within the interval chr8: 6828055–6828082; therefore, it covers a region of approximately  <dig>  kb.  <dig> of the  <dig> hapmap ceu <dig> haplotypes  carry the telomeric replacement polymorphism.

sequence data obtained from the centromeric partial repeat  identified two similar events . in each case, the sequence in the centromeric partial repeat location has been replaced by sequence from the equivalent region of the full repeats. exchange  <dig> haplotypes contain a replacement extending over at least 140 bp. the centromeric boundary of the replacement falls within the region chr8: 6876928– <dig>  the telomeric boundary extends beyond chr8:  <dig>  although it may be continuous with the block of full repeats. exchange  <dig> haplotypes contain a replacement extending over at least 1990 bp. the centromeric boundary of the replacement falls within the region chr8: 6878778– <dig>  the telomeric boundary extends beyond chr8:  <dig>  although it may be continuous with the block of full repeats.figure  <dig> 
gene conversion events at
defa1a <dig> 
a) the defa1a <dig> full and partial repeats are highly similar in their sequence, such that the partial repeats can be aligned with the full repeats . however, there are sequence differences between the defa1a <dig> full and partial repeats. array cgh data and pcr analysis identified a sequence replacement in the defa1a <dig> telomeric partial repeat, in which the sequence from the equivalent region of the defa1a <dig> full repeats replaced the sequence in the telomeric partial repeat location. this occurred over approximately a  <dig>  kb interval and is referred to as the “telomeric replacement polymorphism”. b) sequence data for a  <dig>  kb region within the defa1a <dig> centromeric partial repeat  identified two additional gene conversion events- a ~140 bp event termed “exchange 1” and a ~1990 bp event termed “exchange 2”.



defa1a3haplotype classes
sequence similarity across the  <dig>  kb centromeric flanking region allowed the identification of five different classes of defa1a <dig> haplotype, in which haplotypes within each class shared identical or highly similar flanking sequence, which was distinct from the sequence of haplotypes within the other classes. these five classes are: reference sequence , class  <dig>  class  <dig> , exchange  <dig>  and exchange  <dig> .

four snps were identified, through a combination of sequencing and analysis of phased hapmap data
 <cit>  , which, due to their pattern of ld, are able to tag the five defa1a <dig> haplotype classes . the diploid defa1a <dig> class genotype was identified for an additional  <dig> independent european individuals  and the defa1a <dig> haplotype class was identified for the  <dig> haplotypes from the  <dig> genomes project. across the  <dig> independent haplotypes sampled, only  <dig> exceptions to the expected pattern of ld were observed; one ecacc hrc haplotype and two  <dig> genomes project asian  haplotypes. the frequency distribution of the haplotype classes varies significantly worldwide ; χ2 =  <dig>  p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  in the <dig> genome asn, american  and european  samples, the reference sequence class is the most frequent, with class  <dig> the next most common class. however, this is not the case in the  <dig> genomes african  samples, where class  <dig> is by far the most common defa1a <dig> haplotype class. the eur samples have a low frequency of exchange  <dig>  compared to the worldwide frequency of exchange  <dig>  whilst exchange  <dig> is absent, or at a very low frequency, in the afr and asn samples.table  <dig>

features of defa1a3haplotype classes
the snp rs <dig> has previously been identified as a tag of defa1a <dig> copy number in the european population , with the c allele tagging haplotypes with a low defa1a <dig> copy number  and the t allele tagging haplotypes with a high defa1a <dig> copy number 
 <cit> . we investigated whether a combination of four snp genotypes may further partition this association or identify tags of additional features. therefore, the diploid defa1a <dig> haplotype class  was compared to features of the defa1a <dig> copy number variable region using either a chi square or cochran armitage test, for  <dig> unrelated european individuals . the diploid defa1a <dig> copy number, as well as the ratio of the number of copies of defa <dig> versus defa <dig>  inserted to deleted form of a 5 bp indel  and unduplicated to duplicated form of a 7 bp duplication  are known for these samples 
 <cit> , allowing a comparison between defa1a <dig> haplotype class and multiple variants at the locus.table  <dig>

this demonstrates that each defa1a <dig> haplotype class has its own unique profile of features. both the reference sequence and exchange  <dig> haplotypes are associated with a high defa1a <dig> copy number, whilst class  <dig> and class  <dig> are associated with a low defa1a <dig> copy number . this forms the basis of the previously reported association between the snp rs <dig> and defa1a <dig> copy number in the european population, with reference sequence and exchange  <dig> haplotypes having the t allele and class  <dig> and class  <dig> haplotypes the c allele. however, haplotype-specific copy number information, obtained by khan et al. demonstrates that each defa1a <dig> haplotype class is not associated with a single copy number state
 <cit> . for example, whilst exchange  <dig> haplotypes are generally associated with a high copy number, exchange  <dig> haplotypes with between 2– <dig> copies have been observed in the hapmap ceu <dig> population 
 <cit> . in addition to associations with defa1a <dig> copy number, all five classes show an association with the frequency of the defa <dig> gene and the indel <dig> insertion, whilst only two defa1a <dig> haplotype classes are significantly associated with the frequency of the 7 bp duplication .

however, these associations are based solely on the european population and it is not clear if the same features can be extended to other worldwide populations. whilst information for the three internal allelic variants  was unavailable, the defa1a <dig> copy number has been estimated for  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals within the  <dig> genomes project. this allowed a comparison of defa1a <dig> haplotype class with defa1a <dig> diploid copy number in non-european populations . the  <dig> genome amr samples show an association of class  <dig> with a low defa1a <dig> copy number and reference sequence and exchange  <dig> with a high copy number, the same as was observed in the ceu and hrc samples. however, the association of class  <dig> and a low copy number, which was observed for the european samples, is not replicated in the amr samples. despite this, the snp rs <dig> is still significantly associated with defa1a <dig> copy number in the amr samples . the asn samples also show associations of class  <dig> with a low defa1a <dig> copy number and of reference sequence with a high copy number, as well as of exchange  <dig> with a low copy number. whilst this mirrors the association with rs <dig> observed in the eur samples, class  <dig> is significantly associated with a high defa1a <dig> copy number in the asn samples, leading to a weaker association between rs <dig> genotype and defa1a <dig> copy number . there are no significant associations between haplotype class and defa1a <dig> copy number in the afr samples, suggesting high within-class variability in copy number and explaining the observation that the snp rs <dig> does not tag copy number in this population . the  <dig> genome dataset also provides information on additional eur samples. the associations identified differ from those observed previously; although the association between class  <dig> and a low defa1a <dig> copy number and reference sequence with a high copy number are observed, class  <dig> and exchange  <dig> show no association with defa1a <dig> copy number and a novel association of exchange  <dig> with a low copy number is observed.table  <dig>

defa1a3haplotype structures
emulsion haplotype fusion pcr  has previously been applied at the defa1a <dig> locus to determine the relative positions of the defa <dig> and defa <dig> genes across a haplotype
 <cit> . by applying this technique to additional variants, a more detailed picture of the haplotype structures of the locus can be determined, allowing the mechanisms of change in copy number at defa1a <dig> to be identified. for  <dig> independent haplotypes in the hapmap ceu <dig> population, the defa1a <dig> copy number, as well as the ratio of defa <dig> vs. defa <dig> and inserted to deleted form of indel <dig> are known
 <cit> . the positions of these allelic variants were determined for  <dig> of these  <dig> haplotypes using ehf-pcr and sequencing . the centromeric-most indel <dig> site is located within the sequenced flanking region  and as such, the centromeric-most position was captured for all  <dig> haplotypes. in this location, only the deleted form was observed.figure  <dig>

haplotype structures. the common defa1a <dig> haplotype structures observed in haplotypes with european ancestry  obtained using ehf-pcr and sequencing. “del” and “ins” refer to the deleted and inserted forms of the indel <dig> variant.  <dig> of the  <dig> haplotypes observed  conformed to one of these structures.



the structures of  <dig> reference sequence haplotypes were determined,  <dig> of which display one of the structures shown in figure 
 <dig>  whilst there are many different structural haplotypes, with  <dig> or  <dig> copies of defa1a <dig>  the structures are highly similar to each other, with single copy differences between most structures that could be accounted for by a single deletion or duplication event. two of the haplotypes with structures that do not fit this pattern have only two copies of defa1a <dig>  which is unusual for haplotypes within the reference sequence class, whilst the three others have the indel <dig> insertion at the second repeat from the telomeric end, suggesting a structural rearrangement.

for class  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> haplotypes observed display a structure shown in figure 
 <dig>  in which there are a variable number of copies of a repeat unit containing defa <dig> and the indel <dig> insertion. in this case, not only do the haplotypes share a similar structure, but the repeat units are also highly similar. the two haplotypes which do not fit this pattern both have a copy of the defa <dig> gene, which is usually absent from class  <dig> haplotypes.

for class  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> haplotypes observed display a structure shown in figure 
 <dig>  again, there is a single deletion or duplication event that could account for the differences between the haplotypes. the haplotype which does not fit this pattern lacks defa <dig>  which is uncommon for class  <dig> haplotypes.

for exchange  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> haplotypes display the structure shown in figure 
4; these are similar to class  <dig> haplotypes, but vary in copy number from 1– <dig> copies. again, it is not just the structures, but the repeat units that are highly similar. the haplotype that does not fit this pattern includes the defa <dig> gene, which is usually absent from exchange  <dig> haplotypes. there are only three examples of exchange  <dig> haplotypes analysed, all with the same structure and with all three repeats containing both defa <dig> and the indel <dig> deletion.

although there is within-class variation, the structures identify common features of each defa1a <dig> class. for example, if reference sequence haplotypes contain a copy of the defa <dig> gene, it is in the centromeric-most copy, whereas for class  <dig> haplotypes, it is in the telomeric-most copy. for the indel <dig> variant, both class  <dig> and exchange  <dig> haplotype have the deletion allele in the centromeric-most copy of the array. for reference sequence haplotypes, the indel <dig> insertion allele is always in the telomeric-most copy, whereas for class  <dig>  it is in the middle copy of three-copy haplotypes.

discussion
in order to fully understand the relationship between multiallelic cnv and expression, it is necessary to not only reliably genotype the copy number, but to understand the positions of these copies across a haplotype. this is especially true at a locus like defa1a <dig>  in which each repeat unit in the array can be occupied by one of two different genes. through the use of flanking sequence information, five common defa1a <dig> haplotype classes have been identified, each of which has specific associations with internal variants in populations of european ancestry. a small-scale analysis on  <dig> genomes samples demonstrates between-population differences within each defa1a <dig> haplotype class. this is due to the combination of the different copy number distributions associated with each haplotype class and the varying frequencies of the classes between populations.

the use of ehf-pcr to provide spatial information at the defa1a <dig> locus has been expanded in this study, to look not only at the positions of the defa <dig> and defa <dig> genes across a haplotype, but also the positions of an additional allelic variant, indel <dig>  although the indel <dig> variant does not necessarily change the expression or function of hnp1- <dig>  it provides an additional landmark across a haplotype, allowing a more detailed comparison of haplotype structures. in total, structural haplotypes were obtained for  <dig> independent haplotypes within the hapmap ceu <dig> population. the ceu <dig> population sample appears to be representative of the wider european cohort in terms of the associations between defa1a <dig> class and features of the locus . therefore, the structures observed should be representative of haplotypes with european ancestry. the structures observed show that haplotypes within each defa1a <dig> class have highly similar structures, despite having different copy numbers. in addition, some classes have multiple copies of a repeat unit containing the same gene and indel <dig> allele, which was expected, given that all five defa1a <dig> classes are significantly associated with either a high or low frequency of both defa <dig> and the indel <dig> insertion. this repeat unit similarity is likely to promote nahr, which relies on high sequence identity to facilitate rearrangements. given that the defa1a <dig> locus falls within a region of high ld, this information suggests that the major mechanisms for copy number change at the defa1a <dig> locus involve intra-allelic rearrangements- i.e. nahr between haplotypes from the same defa1a <dig> haplotype class. this process would allow changes in defa1a <dig> copy number, via nahr resulting in chromosomal crossover, but would preserve the surrounding ld, as rearrangements would occur between haplotypes within the same defa1a <dig> class. this presumably results from a bias towards nahr between sister chromatids, rather than between homologous chromosomes, during meiosis. a bias for nahr between sister chromatids has been observed previously at the tandemly duplicated human alpha satellite dna
 <cit> , as well as a bias towards nahr between homologue chromosomes at the a <dig> locus in maize
 <cit> .

a clear example of intra-allelic nahr is observed in the exchange  <dig> class, which is expected to be younger than the four other classes, given that it is absent from the asian population and is very rare in the african population. exchange  <dig> haplotypes with between  <dig> and  <dig> copies have been observed and the structures identified in samples with european ancestry show there are variable numbers of copies of a repeat unit with the same gene and indel <dig> allele.

however, intra-allelic rearrangements will not be the only mechanism operating at the locus. inter-allelic rearrangements will occur, but given the conservation of ld across the defa1a <dig> locus, it is likely that inter-allelic nahr more often results in gene conversion than chromosomal crossover. this study has identified three gene conversion events occurring in the flanking regions of the defa1a <dig> locus, supporting this idea. in addition, the vast majority of class  <dig> haplotypes lack defa <dig>  but defa3-positve class  <dig> haplotypes have been observed and this is likely to have resulted from an introduction of defa <dig> to a class  <dig> background, via gene conversion. this idea is consistent with previous studies identifying gene conversion events at variable number tandem repeat loci
, to which defa1a <dig> is comparable, given it contains multiple copies of a repeat unit with high sequence similarity, positioned in tandem. gene conversion will homogenise repeat units, which in turn will facilitate further rearrangement events.

many studies at regions of cnv fail to identify a robust association between copy number and disease risk. this is due to a combination of two factors. firstly, many studies fail to accurately measure multiallelic copy number, leading to an association that cannot be reproduced
. secondly, there is an expectation of a linear relationship in which an increase in copy number results in a proportionate increase in protein expression; however, this is not always the case
 <cit> . as shown for the fcgr3b and nbpf <dig> loci, knowledge of the allelic structures of the region may be necessary to determine how cnv influences gene expression
 <cit> . despite accurate measurement of defa1a <dig> copy number
 <cit> , the relationship between gene copy number and expression at this locus remains unclear. although a positive correlation between defa1a <dig> copy number and hnp1- <dig> expression has been reported previously
 <cit> , this was a small-scale study. structural information may be required to fully understand the relationship between defa1a <dig> copy number and hnp1- <dig> expression, as well as explain the association between the defa1a <dig> locus and iga nephropathy risk
 <cit> . in samples with european ancestry, haplotypes within each defa1a <dig> class have highly similar structures. therefore, the simple genotyping of the four snps which tag defa1a <dig> haplotype class, identified in this study, will be sufficient for inferring haplotype structures for haplotypes with european ancestry. this approach could easily be applied to studies comparing defa1a <dig> structure with hnp1- <dig> expression or association with a disease phenotype. therefore, the use of structural information, as derived here for defa1a <dig>  should be applied to other copy number variable loci, in order to explain associations between the variation observed and protein expression. this may, in turn, aid the understanding of the features of a copy number variable locus that influence disease risk.

CONCLUSIONS
we have defined five common classes of haplotype at the defa1a <dig> locus. each class is associated with particular features of the defa1a <dig> locus and these associations differ between populations. structural haplotypes have been obtained across the defa1a <dig> locus for  <dig> haplotypes with european ancestry, allowing the identification of the common allelic structures at defa1a <dig>  the structures suggest that intra-allelic rearrangement is the predominant mechanism resulting in copy number variation at the defa1a <dig> locus.
