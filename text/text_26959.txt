BACKGROUND
reverse vaccinology uses the genome sequences of viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens of interest rather than the cells as starting material for the identification of novel antigens, whose activity should be subsequently confirmed by experimental biology approaches
 <cit> . in general, the aim of this approach is the identification of genes potentially encoding pathogenicity factors and secreted or membrane-associated proteins. in this context, specific algorithms suitable for the in silico identification of novel surface-exposed and, thus, antibody accessible proteins mediating a protective immune response are used
 <cit> .

pizza and co-workers in collaboration with the institute for genomic research  provided the first example of a successful application of the reverse vaccinology approach
 <cit> . they described that in silico identification of vaccine candidates against neisseria meningitides serogroup b, which is the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults, could be effective, while conventional approaches to obtain a vaccine had failed for decades.

new powerful genomic technologies have increased the number of diseases that can be addressed by vaccination, and have reduced the time of discovery research and vaccine development
 <cit> . nowadays, it costs us$ 200– <dig> million to research, develop, manufacture and launch a new vaccine on the global market
 <cit> . with the use of reverse vaccinology, time and cost spent on the search of new vaccine targets are significantly reduced.

immunoinformatics is an emerging application of bioinformatics techniques that focuses on the structure, function, and interactions of the molecules involved in immunity. one of its main goals is the in silico prediction of immunogenicity at epitope level. recently developed in silico tools and databases can be used to identify, characterize or predict antigen epitopes recognized by t- and b-lymphocytes, cells that play significant roles in infection and protective immunity
 <cit> .

epitopes are the minimal essential units of information derived from self and nonself proteins that stimulate cellular  and humoral  immune responses. t-cells recognize t-cell epitopes that are derived from endogenous and exogenous proteins and presented in the cleft of mhc class i or mhc class ii molecules at the surface of antigen presenting cells to the t-cell receptor. after the activation of cd8+ t cells or cd4+ t cells, respectively, cellular events, such as citotoxicity and cytokine secretion, will occur. b-cells also recognize epitopes, but generally intact proteins. b-cell epitopes can be linear, contiguous amino acids, or discontinuous amino acids that are brought together in folded proteins. after activation, b-cells differentiate into plasmocytes and start secreting antibodies. b- and t-cell responses are called humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses, respectively, and they inform the immune system that a bacteria, virus, or parasite is present
 <cit> .

the subcellular localization of the protein is also important to investigate, as immunogenic proteins have to be in contact with t- and b-cells in order to elicit a protective immune response. in other words, correct subcellular localization is of great significance to the functional analysis of proteins
 <cit> . therefore, various prediction methods have been developed to predict proteins’ subcellular location in the recent decades
 <cit> . prediction methods to identify the subcellular location of proteins can be classified into two categories: one is based on the recognition of protein n-terminal sorting signals
 <cit>  and the other is based on amino acid composition
 <cit> . the predictors then combine these features with machine-learning techniques to decide which is the most probable location
 <cit> .

a large variety of machine-learning techniques are commonly used in bioinformatics, including artificial neural networks 
 <cit> , hidden markov models 
 <cit>  and support vector machines 
 <cit> . anns and svms are ideally suited to recognize non-linear patterns, which are believed to contribute to, for instance, peptide-hla-i interactions
 <cit> . in an ann, information is trained and distributed into a computer network with an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer all connected in a given structure through weighted connections
 <cit> . finally, hmms are well suited to characterized biological motifs with an inherent structural composition, and have been used in the field of immunology to predict peptide binding to major histocompatibility complex  class i molecules
 <cit> .

the use of database system has been constant in the life of researchers and professionals in several fields. conceptually, a database should be able to provide an easy access to experimental results and lexical surveys, preventing redundancy and wasteful duplication of research data. a well-designed database should also be able to provide support to researchers, facilitating guided searches for novel correlations in data. on the other hand, a poorly designed database makes the data mining process difficult and the new data integration infeasible for regular users
 <cit>  and in this perspective, the rebuilding and redesigning processes are frequent
 <cit> .

the current challenge of modern biology is to unravel and understand the complex system of biological organization and to signal in all of its details at a molecular level. an essential part of this process goes through bioinformatics, particularly the use of management systems, and relational databases applied to biological data. biological data reside in specialized databases that represent different data interpretation stages or different facets of biological phenomena
 <cit> . also, biological data present a particularity: they are highly complex when compared with data from most of other applications. thus, definitions of such biological data must be able to represent a complex substructure of data as well as their relationships, and also ensure that no information is lost during the biological data modeling. the data model must be able to represent any level of complexity in any data schema, relationship, or schema substructure and not just in a hierarchical, binary, or tabular data format
 <cit> .

the main objective of this present work was to build a database-driven epitope prediction method capable of accurately predicting parasite b- and t-cell epitopes, as well as subcellular localization of parasites proteins . the interface language used was standard sql  and several built-in functions were implemented, but are not limited to, the following: a) parse algorithms predictions and storage of experimental validated and predicted data; and b) evaluation of algorithm performances.

RESULTS
mhc-i epitopes prediction
several approaches that predict peptide binding to mhc molecules have been published
 <cit> . in this study we opt for two currently available algorithms, netctl
 <cit>  and netmhc
 <cit> . our choice for these mhc class i epitope prediction algorithms was made in terms of isi citation indexes and regarding their availability for download and local machine implementation.

when possible, in order to establish the ideal settings for protozoan epitope prediction, the algorithms parameters were scanned and evaluated in terms of auc values. in this framework, the netctl score threshold parameter was ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the netctl and netmhc algorithms outputs were parsed and the data of  <dig>  in silico predicted epitopes loaded into mysql database. in order to evaluate the algorithm performances, predicted epitopes [see additional file
 <dig> and additional file
2] were aligned against the consensus experimentally validated dataset for mhc class i epitopes. figure 
 <dig> presents an overview of the benchmark approach undertaken in this study . in addition, we carried out a combined performance analysis using the best score threshold found for each methodology .

the auc performance measure obtained for netctl was  <dig>   and for netmhc was  <dig>  . on the other hand, the combined performance of these algorithms produced an auc value of  <dig>  .

b-cell epitopes prediction
following the same rational described above for mhc i algorithm selection, three currently available algorithms were chosen, bepipred
 <cit> , bcpred12
 <cit>  and aap12
 <cit> . when possible, in order to establish the ideal settings for protozoan epitope prediction, the algorithms parameters were scanned and then evaluated in terms of auc values. in this framework, the score thresholds parameter ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for bepipred and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for aap <dig> and bcpred <dig> 

using the developed pipeline, the default algorithms outputs were parsed and the data of  <dig>  in silico predicted epitopes [see additional file
 <dig>  additional file
 <dig> and additional file
5] loaded into the mysql database. in order to evaluate the algorithm performances, predicted epitopes were aligned against the consensus experimentally validated dataset for b cell epitopes. furthermore, we carried out a combined performance analysis using the best score threshold found for each methodology .

the auc performance measure obtained was:  <dig>  for bepipred using a threshold of  <dig> ;  <dig>  for aap <dig> using a threshold of  <dig> ; and  <dig>  for bcpred <dig> using a threshold of  <dig>  . regarding the combined performance analysis performed for these algorithms, the following results were found:  <dig>  for aap <dig> and bcpred12;  <dig>  for aap <dig> and bepipred;  <dig>  for bcpred <dig> and bepipred; and  <dig>  for aap <dig>  bcpred <dig> and bepipred.

subcellular localization of proteins prediction
regarding prediction of subcellular localization of proteins, three currently available algorithms were selected, wolf psort
 <cit> , sigcleave
 <cit>  and targetp
 <cit> . using the developed pipeline, the default algorithms outputs were parsed and the data of  <dig> in silico predictions loaded into the mysql database. in order to evaluate the algorithms performances, an experimental validated dataset of  <dig> proteins with described subcellular localization was loaded in addition to in silico predictions. results show that wolf psort was capable of correctly predicting 27/ <dig>  secreted proteins, sigcleave, 30/ <dig> , and targetp, 32/ <dig> , showing that the proportion of correctly predicted binders  was similar between the three algorithms . files containing predictions made by each algorithm are available as additional files [see for wolf psort, additional file
6; for sigcleave, additional file
7; for targetp, additional file
 <dig> 

the evaluation of the intersecting portion of predictions made by the tested algorithms showed that, from  <dig> protozoan proteins with extracellular localization experimentally determined,  <dig>  were correctly predicted by all three algorithms .

discussion
despite of being a major public health problem in several countries, the life-threatening diseases caused by protozoan parasites represent a challenge in terms of vaccine development and nowadays there is no efficient vaccine against these parasites.

epitope prediction by computational methods represents one of the most promising approaches to vaccine development, but there are several drawbacks in the process regarding trypanosomatid genomes. in this context, the lack of sufficiently large datasets of experimentally validated protozoan epitopes represents a serious limitation for validation of parasite in silico epitope prediction.

several prediction methods were developed, but none of them had protozoan parasites data as training dataset  and, consequently, these results can be biased and should be treated with a grain of salt. the general wisdom is that the performance of epitope prediction methods critically depends on the dataset used for training and also on protein compositional bias. in addition, it is influenced by the evaluation criteria. regarding epitope prediction in parasite genomes, these drawbacks are noteworthy considering that these organisms have a genome content that reflects proteins with a particular physicochemical profile and that are underrepresented in training datasets.

for this reason, we do not try to rank various prediction methods. rather, we focus on the key concepts and ideas in the field. thus, we evaluated algorithm performances focusing on parasites genomes. comparison between algorithms was made in the basis of auc  values, which represent the probability that a randomly selected positive instance will score higher than a randomly selected negative instance
 <cit> .

aiming at identifying a good set of tools for protozoan parasites epitope prediction and subcellular localization of proteins, we developed, in this work, a database approach in order to integrate and evaluate the combined performances of some open source currently available algorithms for mhc class i and b-cell epitope prediction, as well as for subcellular localization using protozoan parasites proteins and epitopes experimentally identified.

concerning the epitope prediction, a database schema was developed and implemented integrating experimental validated data together with the information related to mhc i prediction  and b-cells prediction .

the main source of experimental data was “immune epitope database and analysis resource”  
 <cit> , that currently represents the main source of linear and conformational epitopes data. besides, iedb uses a metric that takes into account the number of references, number of positive assays, and total number of assays for each epitope which is crucial to extract an experimentally validated epitope subset with a high level of confidence for the benchmark.

regarding mhc i prediction, our auc results indicate a little difference in the performances related with netctl and netmhc algorithms,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. if we consider that it is reported that the mhc class i prediction methods have achieved an accuracy that in many cases allows for auc values in the range  <dig> - <dig> 
 <cit> , both algorithms didn′t achieve the expected performance. in fact, this is not the first time that underperformance of prediction algorithms is reported in literature. in a recent study,  <dig> 9mer peptides from influenza a virus were predicted as potential binders by netmhc, and just  <dig> of them  were confirmed as real binders
 <cit> . furthermore, the underrepresentation of protozoan proteins in the training datasets in general and the compositional bias certainly have a deep impact on epitope prediction methods and also in the benchmark. in fact, to highlight the different performances of tested algorithms in front of different datasets and exclude the influence of approach undertaken, we evaluated the algorithm performances under the same framework but with the human proteins dataset available for download from netctl website
 <cit> . the results for both netctl and netmhc algorithms were considerably better than the results obtained for protozoan dataset. the auc value for netctl was  <dig>  and for netmhc was  <dig>  . in addition, our performance evaluation does not include mhcii prediction since experimental data was insufficiently represented . in practice, the prediction of mhc-peptide binding is far from perfect, but this fact does not preclude all the advances made in the last years in the field
 <cit> .

regarding b-cell epitope prediction, our auc results indicate a better performance for bcpred <dig> algorithms when compared to aap <dig> and bepipred . again the observed performances were inferior from those currently observed for b-cell epitope predictions
 <cit> . this difference might be explained by same reasons which were just discussed for mhci prediction. also for b-cell epitope prediction, this is not the first report in literature of low epitope prediction performance
 <cit> .

lafuente and reche  believe launching a critical assesment of techniques for epitope prediction will benefit the field. under this program, computational methods will be used for blind de novo prediction of peptides that are immunogenic from query proteins that, for evaluation purposes, has been experimentally screened
 <cit> . considering that and the results obtained by us, we do believe this approach will be useful to bring advances to epitope prediction area.

despite of the shortcomings cited above, the combined performance analysis seems to be a promising approach. for b-cell algorithms, when the combined performance analysis was made, the best combination performance was found for aap <dig> and bcpred <dig> that reached an auc value of  <dig> , which is within the expect range reported
 <cit> .

seen in the light of the results obtained, the developed approach calls attention to several points: a) the general prediction models used by currently available algorithms cannot be used with the same performance for different protein subsets ; b) the need for studies in which the algorithm performances are evaluated for underrepresented and compositional biased proteins subsets; and c) the combinatorial prediction approach can improve the epitope prediction performance.

concerning the subcellular localization prediction, the database schema developed also integrated experimental and predicted data for subcellular localization of proteins. experimental data was obtained from uniprot , and the in silico predictions made by wolf psort, sigcleave and targetp algorithms. the result shows that there is not much difference, in terms of percentage of matches, between the tested algorithms. nevertheless, the venn diagram analysis related to true positives  result shows that the tested algorithms match different proteins in the dataset, and the consensus prediction of the three algorithms would better define a protein located in the extracellular compartment.

CONCLUSIONS
considering the public health importance of the studied organisms and the lack of studies specifically addressing epitope and subcellular localization prediction in these parasites, our results suggest that the algorithm combinatorial approach employed in the developed database-driven epitope prediction methodology is capable of proposing the best set of tools for in silico epitope prediction in protozoan parasite genomes. several drawbacks exist, but the present work will certainly speed up the process of data mining analysis and prediction of potential candidates for vaccine development.
