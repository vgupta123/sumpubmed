BACKGROUND
the nematode c. elegans represents a simple and experimentally tractable multicellular organism, which has been used to investigate many biological processes, including chemosensory behaviour  <cit> . it uses only  <dig> pairs of amphid chemosensory neurons to detect environmental signals. as in mammalian systems, gpcrs play an important role in the detection of sensory signals, and these signals are relayed in the cell by heterotrimeric g proteins. in contrast to mammalian chemosensory systems, the c. elegans sensory neurons express multiple gpcrs in each sensory neuron using several gα subunits per neuron for sensory transduction, thus allowing the nematode to respond specifically to different environmental cues using only a few sensory neurons  <cit> .

current methods utilised to study mammalian gpcr-ligand interactions are mostly in vitro systems, which are not always an accurate reflection of in vivo interactions. given that mammalian gpcrs are an important group of drug targets, it would be an advantage to have an accessible in vivo system to investigate gpcr interactions with its respective agonists and antagonists. using c. elegans to study in vivo gpcr-ligand interactions is an advantage because functional expression of heterologous olfactory receptors in the awa and awb olfactory neurons has previously been shown   <cit>  and our unpublished observations. however, olfactory neurons are not directly exposed to the environment, but are embedded in the glial-like amphid sheath cells, making them inaccessible to non-volatile soluble ligands  <cit> . critically, they are inaccessible to most non-volatile soluble ligands, precluding the possibility of using such a system for identifying drugs that affect gpcr activity. hence, we set out to test whether we would elicit ligand-dependent behavioural responses in c. elegans by expressing mammalian gpcrs in the ash and adl gustatory neurons, as they are directly exposed to the environment allowing access of protein and peptide ligands to the heterologous receptors. in addition, the ash and adl neurons express a large variety of gα subunits  <cit> , increasing the likelihood of gpcr-gα protein interaction. the nociceptive neurons, ash and adl, drive repulsive responses,  <cit>  and so receptor activation is reflected in an avoidance response on ligand exposure, which can be analysed using robust behavioural assays  <cit> . to test this, we chose to functionally express two medically relevant gpcrs, sstr <dig> and ccr <dig>  somatostatin receptors bind two isoforms of a tetradecapeptide, sst- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . both have broad regulatory functions, acting as neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system and inhibitors of hormone secretion  <cit> . ccr <dig> is a chemokine receptor that binds mip-1α , mip-1β  and rantes, and directs chemotactic responses in leucocytes. this receptor is also the route by which hiv- <dig> infection occurs, making this receptor a therapeutic target in aids treatment  <cit> .

here we show that transgenic c. elegans expressing mammalian sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> in the ash and adl nociceptive neurons display specific and robust avoidance responses to their respective ligands. the avoidance behaviour to somatostatin in sstr <dig> transgenic animals can be inhibited using the somatostatin antagonist cyclosomatostatin. furthermore, pre-exposure of the gpcr transgenic animals to their respective ligand abolishes this avoidance response without affecting its avoidance behaviour towards other repellent compounds. heterologously expressed gpcrs are able to signal via different endogenous gα subunits depending on which cells they are expressed in, indicating that gpcrs and gα proteins are largely conserved in their interaction domains across highly diverged species. finally, we demonstrate the utility of this avoidance assay by identifying the key residues involved in interaction of somatostatin with its receptor.

RESULTS
transgenic animals expressing heterologous mammalian gpcrs are able to direct specific responses to agonists
to express mammalian gpcrs in the ash and adl nociceptive neurons, we cloned the receptor genes downstream of the gpa- <dig> promoter, which drives expression in these neuron pairs  <cit> . following injection, transgenic animals were visualised using a gut-expressed elt-2::gfp construct, allowing selection of live transgenic animals from mixed populations using a flow sorter  modified with a 150-μm flow-cell tip .

sorted populations of sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> transgenic animals  were tested for their response to the native ligands using a soluble compound avoidance assay adapted from wicks et al  <cit> ; . wild type and sstr <dig> transgenic animals were tested for their response to varying concentrations of sst- <dig>  in contrast to wild-type animals, sstr <dig> transgenic animals exhibited avoidance of sst- <dig> . the strongest response was observed with  <dig> μm sst- <dig>  ovine isolated sst- <dig> and human sst- <dig> have previously been found to have higher biological activity than sst- <dig>  <cit> . the behaviour of the sstr <dig> transgenic animals is consistent with this; sst- <dig> and sst- <dig> induced stronger avoidance responses than sst- <dig> . as a control, we tested the response of this strain to neurotensin and mip-1α. neither compounds elicited a response in the sstr <dig> transgenic animals, confirming specificity of gpcr-ligand interaction .

in order to confirm that other gpcrs could be expressed functionally in c. elegans, we generated transgenic animals that express ccr <dig> in the ash/adl neurons. transgenic strains were tested for avoidance of mip-1α, sst- <dig> and neurotensin. ccr <dig> transgenic animals only showed avoidance of mip-1α, not of the control peptides . an optimal avoidance response was obtained with  <dig> μm mip-1α. in addition, we also expressed ccr <dig> in the ash neurons using the sra- <dig> promoter, which also gave a robust avoidance response to  <dig> μm mip-1α. this demonstrates that mammalian gpcr expression in the ash neurons is sufficient to generate avoidance behaviour to its ligands. we also tested the response of the sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> transgenic animals to sst- <dig> and mip-1α using the dry-drop test  <cit> . the average frequency of avoidance for each tested compound in this single animal assay was very similar to that in the population assay .

the ash and adl neurons of c. elegans normally direct avoidance responses to environmental agents such as low ph and sodium dodecyl sulphate   <cit> . when exposed to a barrier of 1% sds, neither transgenic strain crossed the barrier, suggesting that normal avoidance behaviour is unaffected by expression of heterologous gpcrs. we have thus shown that expression of mammalian gpcrs in transgenic animals generates a specific avoidance response towards its respective agonists.

sstr <dig> antagonist, cyclosomatostatin can inhibit response of sstr <dig> transgenic animals to somatostatin
to analyse the specificity of ligand-receptor interaction reflected in the avoidance response, sstr <dig> transgenic animals were tested with a competitive somatostatin antagonist, cyclosomatostatin , which blocks somatostatin binding to its receptors  <cit> . pre-exposure of sstr <dig> transgenic animals to  <dig> μm of cyclosomatostatin in liquid for  <dig> minutes eliminated most of the avoidance behaviour towards  <dig> μm sst- <dig> . higher concentrations of cyclosomatostatin and longer incubation times tend to cause paralysis in both wild-type and transgenic animals . we also tested for reversibility of this antagonistic effect by allowing the worms to recover for  <dig> minutes by washing them after the  <dig> minute pre-incubation step. the resulting effect was a recovery of the sstr <dig> transgenic animals' avoidance behaviour to sst- <dig> . hence, the avoidance response to sst- <dig> could be restored in  <dig> minutes after antagonist pre-exposure.

mammalian heterologous gpcrs can signal via different endogenous gα subunits in c. elegans
our results confirm that the biological properties of the gpcrs can be translated into the altered sensory behaviour of the transgenic animals, suggesting that heterologous gpcrs use c. elegans signal transduction in nociceptive neurons. gpa- <dig> is expressed predominantly in adl neurons, and to a lesser extent in ash neurons  <cit> . the ash and adl neurons express a variety of gα proteins. little is known about the molecules used in the adl cells. nociceptive signalling in ash involve the gα proteins odr- <dig>  <cit>  and gpa- <dig>  <cit> . these in turn lead to downstream activation of trpv calcium-channel osm- <dig> or ocr- <dig>  <cit> . to identify some of the molecules involved, we tested several mutants known to affect avoidance behaviour. inactivation of osm- <dig> or gpa- <dig> fully abolished the response to sst- <dig> and mip-1α in sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> transgenic animals respectively, whereas inactivation of odr- <dig> did not . these results indicate that the heterologous gpcrs, expressed predominantly in the adl signals via gpa- <dig> to activate osm- <dig>  in contrast, the avoidance response to mip-1α of sra-6::ccr <dig> animals expressing ccr <dig> predominantly in the ash neurons  were not affected by removal of gpa- <dig> or odr- <dig>   <cit> . given that sra- <dig> is weakly expressed in asi that mediates attraction behaviour, this may have a subtle effect on avoidance mediated by the asi neurons, although is unlikely to affect the avoidance behaviour of the transgenic animals towards its ligands. our results indicate that ccr <dig> can activate different c. elegans gα subunits, depending in which cells it is expressed in. in ash neurons, ccr <dig> could signal redundantly via gpa- <dig> or odr- <dig> or any of the other gα subunits present in these neurons. these results illustrate a level of promiscuity in the interactions between heterologous gpcrs and the endogenous signalling components of c. elegans.

pre-exposure to native agonists causes receptor desensitisation and adaptation behaviour in sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> transgenic animals
activation of gpcrs in both worms and mammals eventually leads to receptor desensitisation through phosphorylation by gpcr kinases  and arrestins  <cit> . to study whether the response of the sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> transgenic animals to their respective ligands was subject to desensitisation , the animals were pre-exposed to either  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm of the respective peptides in liquid for  <dig> minutes in liquid before testing the avoidance response. the avoidance behaviour of sstr <dig> transgenic animals in response to  <dig> μm sst- <dig> was strongly reduced after pre-exposure to  <dig> μm sst- <dig>  whereas pre-exposure to  <dig> μm sst- <dig> could fully abolish avoidance of sst- <dig> . the avoidance behaviour to other repellents such as 1% sds was not affected by the pre-exposure to sst- <dig>  suggesting that sst- <dig> adaptation is independent from the pathway that signals avoidance of 1% sds. similarly, ccr <dig> transgenic animals were pre-exposed to  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of mip-1α and tested at three different mip-1α concentrations. full adaptation to mip-1α was achieved with both pre-exposure concentrations; however, pre-exposure did not affect other avoidance responses . these results demonstrate that avoidance of sst- <dig> and mip-1α mediated by their respective mammalian gpcrs in c. elegans is subject to specific adaptation. we propose that the c. elegans signalling components involved in receptor desensitisation interact with the heterologous gpcrs.

trp <dig> and lys <dig> of sst- <dig> are essential for sstr <dig> activation
given that heterologous gpcrs can be expressed functionally in nociceptive neurons, we sought to investigate the structure-function relationship by screening sst- <dig> analogues. structure activity studies on sst- <dig> have suggested that the amino-acid residues phe <dig>  trp <dig>  lys <dig> and thr <dig> are important in receptor-ligand interaction, with trp <dig> and lys <dig> being essential, whereas phe <dig> and thr <dig> can undergo minor conserved substitutions  <cit> . we investigated the role of these residues by testing the five peptides analogues, where residues 6– <dig> of sst- <dig> are individually substituted with ala. the sstr <dig> transgenic animals showed a completely attenuated response towards the trp8Δ ala and lys9Δ ala analogues, whereas partial avoidance responses were observed to both phe7Δ ala and thr10Δ ala . no significant difference in avoidance response was observed with phe6Δ ala, indicating that this residue is not essential for receptor-ligand interaction.

discussion
g protein coupled receptors  represent the largest and most diverse family of proteins in the human genome  <cit> . given that this family of proteins play key roles in many biological processes, they constitute one of the principal targets for drug development. the c. elegans sensory system is exceptionally well suited for heterologous gpcr expression given that each neuron expresses multiple endogenous gpcrs  <cit> . furthermore, multiple gα subunits are expressed in each chemosensory neuron  <cit>  allowing cross-talk between a single gpcr and potentially multiple gα proteins. moreover, the gustatory neurons are exposed to the external environment, making it accessible to water-soluble ligands. here we show that expression of heterologous gpcrs in gustatory neurons under the control of two different promoters, gpa- <dig>  and sra- <dig> , can drive repulsive responses to the respective ligands presented in soluble pure form. the behavioural response to the ligands can be tested using robust avoidance assays, making this an ideal in vivo system to study receptor-ligand interactions. sstr <dig> and ccr <dig> transgenic animals were able to specifically avoid the respective agonists without affecting avoidance behaviour towards other repellents. similar responses were observed in multiple transgenic strains with different promoters using both the population and single-animal avoidance assays. the fidelity of the system extends to antagonists, as pre-exposure of sstr <dig> transgenic animals to a somatostatin antagonist, cyclosomatostatin, inhibited avoidance response to somatostatin. the antagonistic effect was reversible given that the avoidance behaviour could be recovered by washing the transgenic animals. this provides further evidence for specific receptor-ligand interaction.

it has previously been shown that widespread promiscuity occurs in the interactions of mammalian gpcrs with mammalian gα proteins  <cit> . our results demonstrate that mammalian gpcrs integrate into the normal endogenous gα protein signalling pathway in the worm, showing a remarkable evolutionary plasticity in these interactions, spanning  <dig> million years  <cit> . rat sstr <dig> has previously been demonstrated to interact with endogenous yeast gα protein, gpa1p, when the receptor was expressed in sacchromyces cerevisiae, which provides further evidence that g proteins across highly diverged species are largely conserved in their interaction domains  <cit> . moreover, functional expression of mammalian bitter-taste receptors  and trpv  channels in asi and ash neurons have been reported, supporting the suitability of c. elegans as a heterologous expression system  <cit> . in this paper, we show that several gα proteins are involved in downstream signalling in the ash neurons. given the abundance of gα proteins in these neurons, it would be interesting to examine the individual roles of gα proteins involved in signalling with heterologous gpcrs.

attenuation of gpcr signalling by grks and arrestins is important for an organism to maintain a homeostatic cellular environment  <cit> . desensitisation also ensures that receptors are ready for the next coming wave of input stimuli. we found that pre-exposure to varying concentrations of the ligand leads to adaptation of the response to the ligand but not to other repellents. this suggests that the heterologously expressed mammalian gpcrs in c. elegans are subjected to desensitisation by the endogenous machinery, further supporting the notion that heterologous gpcrs are integrated into the endogenous signalling pathway.

the system for heterologous expression of functional gpcrs in c. elegans described here provides a novel means of screening for agonists and antagonists, and for carrying out structure function studies on gpcrs and their ligands. to illustrate this potential, we measured receptor activation on a series of sst- <dig> mutant peptides, in which amino acids at positions 6– <dig> were individually changed to alanine. the avoidance response to trp8Δ ala and lys9Δ ala sst- <dig> analogues was abolished while reduced avoidance behaviour was found with phe7Δ ala and thr10Δ ala. sstr <dig> transgenic animals were repelled by the phe6Δ ala analogue, indicating that phe <dig> is not essential for receptor-ligand interaction. this work confirmed and extended the previous finding, based on activity of hexapeptide analogues, that residues 7– <dig> contain key elements necessary for its biological activity of somatostatin  <cit> . this illustrates the practical utility of this system for identifying structure-function relationships and for screening soluble compounds by measuring behavioural responses in gpcr transgenic animals.

CONCLUSIONS
our work describes the generation of novel behavioural response in c. elegans to exogenous human ligands. this provides a powerful platform for exploring gpcr-ligand interactions in an animal model in vivo. furthermore, the 'synthetic' response holds potential in basic studies of behaviour and higher learning in c. elegans. by exploiting the gustatory chemosensory system in c. elegans, we have developed a novel and rapid assay to study interaction of medically important receptors with both extracellular and intracellular partners and drug candidates.
