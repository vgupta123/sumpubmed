BACKGROUND
we sequenced the genome of a strain  of serotype m <dig> group a streptococcus  <cit> , a human-specific pathogen that is non-randomly associated with neonatal female urogenital infections  <cit> . the genome of strain mgas <dig> has a novel 37-kb element designated rd <dig>   <cit> . rd <dig> is one of seven elements integrated into the chromosome of this strain   <cit> . subsequently we demonstrated that all serotype m <dig> strains studied contained rd <dig> integrated at the same chromosomal site  <cit> . rd <dig> encodes seven secreted extracellular proteins that are expressed in human infections. one of these proteins  is also known as the r <dig> protein, and has been previously studied in gas and group b streptococcus   <cit> . the r <dig> protein has been implicated in virulence based on its ability to mediate binding of gbs to human vaginal epithelial cells  <cit> . protein m28_spy <dig> was recently studied extensively and shown to be a member of the antigen i/ii family of proteins originally described in oral streptococcal species. m28_spy <dig> binds to salivary agglutinin, a 340-kda protein abundantly found in human saliva. zhang et al.  <cit>  recently demonstrated that immunization of mice with recombinant purified m28_spy <dig> confers protection against invasive infection. thus, two proteins encoded by rd <dig> likely contribute to host-pathogen interactions.

several lines of evidence suggest that rd <dig> in gas was acquired by horizontal gene transfer . first, the rd <dig> element is integrated into a trna-threonine gene and flanked by 16bp imperfect direct repeats attccggtggtggca  <cit> . the chromosomal location of rd <dig> is identical in the majority of rd2-positive strains suggesting a conserved mode of integration  <cit> . second, the g+c content of rd <dig>  is significantly lower than the average gas genome  and contains different di-nucleotide content and codon usage  <cit> . an rd2-like element also has been identified in the genome of a serotype m <dig> gas strain  <cit> . the rd <dig> element in this strain is virtually identical at the nucleotide level to rd <dig> present in m <dig> strains. however, the genome sequence of strain mgas <dig>  and mgas <dig>  are otherwise quite divergent from one another. based on single nucleotide polymorphism , the average snp difference between genomes is about  <dig> per  <dig> kb , while only  <dig> nucleotide differences are found within  <dig> kb rd <dig> region  <cit> . the differences in snp frequency within chromosome and rd <dig> region strongly suggests that the rd <dig> element in these strains has had a very different evolutionary history compared to the core chromosome, and was acquired via horizontal transfer  <cit> .

the primary goal of the experiments described herein was to test the hypothesis that the rd <dig> element was laterally transferable in vitro under laboratory conditions, and we found that this was the case. moreover, we identified an rd2-like element in multiple strains of lancefield group c and g streptococci, indicating that this genetic element is more phylogenetically widespread than previously appreciated.

methods
bacterial strains and growth
streptococcal strains of serotypes a, c, and g  were cultured routinely at 37°c in an atmosphere of 5% co <dig> on trypticase soy agar ii plates containing 5% sheep blood  or in liquid todd hewitt medium supplemented with  <dig> % yeast extract . antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: spectinomycin,  <dig> μg/ml; erythromycin,  <dig> μg/ml; and kżanamycin,  <dig> μg/ml.

isolation of total dna from streptococci
dna was isolated from cultures grown overnight in thy medium using a modified phenol-chloroform procedure  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> to  <dig> ml of overnight thy cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in te, ph  <dig> . bacteria were treated with mutanolysin  and lysozyme   with occasional mixing for  <dig> h at 37°c, followed by 2% wt/vol sds , and proteinase k   for  <dig> h at 37°c. dna was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with two volumes of ice-cold ethanol, washed with 70% ice-cold ethanol, and suspended in te, ph  <dig>  buffer containing  <dig>  mg/ml rnase a .

dna amplification by pcr
primers used in pcr reactions are listed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> . pcr was used to investigate the presence and organization of the rd <dig> element in streptococcal strains. the pcr primers #1-# <dig> detect a chromosomal and extrachromosomal circular form, and tile across the entire rd <dig>  confirmation of rd <dig> presence by tailing and detection of genes encoding extra-chromosomal proteins was performed as described previously  <cit> 

construction of isogenic mutant strain mgas6180Δ1325-1326spcr
allelic replacement was used to construct an isogenic mutant strain in which two contiguous genes  encoded by rd <dig> were deleted and replaced by spectinomycin resistance cassette  <cit> . upstream and downstream regions flanking the two-gene segment were cloned in ptopo plasmid  with spectinomycin resistance cassette between them. the gel purified pcr product encompassing both flanks with the spectinomycin cassette was electroporated into cells of strain mgas <dig> made competent as described before  <cit> . the resulting isogenic strain was confirmed to be the correct construct by pcr analysis, dna sequencing, and southern hybridization. successful inactivation of the spy <dig> and spy <dig> genes also was confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr and western immunoblot analysis. detailed strain construction is presented as additional file  <dig> and the confirmation of the proper construction as additional file  <dig> .

filter mating
filter mating procedure was performed according to modified method described previously  <cit> . the mgas6180Δ1325-1326spcr strain was used as a donor of the rd <dig> element in filter mating experiments. strains mgas2221Δcovrs , and mgas <dig>  were used as recipient strains. overnight donor and recipient cultures  were mixed and collected on the surface of a  <dig>  μm pore size sterile nitrocellulose filter . the filter was transferred to the surface of tsa plate without antibiotics and incubated for  <dig> h,  <dig> h, or  <dig> h. after the incubation, the filter was washed with sterile pbs and the bacteria collected in the wash fluid were plated on thy agar plates with appropriate antibiotics. randomly selected colonies resistant to both antibiotics were screened by pcr for the size of emm gene amplicon that is characteristic for m <dig> or m <dig> type and presence of rd <dig> region genes.

induction of genetic elements with mitomycin c and hydrogen peroxide
genetic elements were induced by treating bacterial cultures with mitomycin c as described previously  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> ml of pre-warmed thy medium was inoculated with an overnight culture of mgas  <dig>  and grown until the od reached  <dig>  . the culture was divided into three aliquots, and one aliquot was treated with mitomycin c , second with hydrogen peroxide  and one aliquot was left untreated as a control sample. the concentration of mitomycin c and hydrogen peroxide used for induction of mobile genetic elements was tested for the ability to induce mobile elements and inhibit growth . the concentrations used in the experiment were sufficient to induce mobile elements in mgas <dig> and were above the minimal inhibitory concentration . samples  collected at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h intervals and after overnight incubation and were used for total dna isolation as described above.

quantitative analysis of changes in gene copy number
total dna isolated from control gas or cells treated with mitomycin c or hydrogen peroxide was used as a template in quantitative pcr  reactions. diluted dna was amplified in multiplex reactions. the primers used amplified the chromosomal gene pros  and the target test gene of interest. gene copy number was presented as the difference in amplified copies between control gene pros and the gene of interest  at each experimental condition. the increase in copy number between start  and time point of interest  was calculated according to the equation 2Δct texp/2Δct t <dig> 

RESULTS
comparative analysis of rd <dig> gene content and organization in gas and gbs
sequences homologous to rd <dig> were initially reported to be present in strains of serotype iii and v group b streptococcus   <cit> . by analyzing the available gbs genomic sequences a number of sequences homologous to rd <dig> can be identified   <cit> . the rd <dig> region in gas is integrated into gene encoding trna for threonine, while elements found in gbs genomes carrying rd <dig> gene homologs are integrated into gene encoding trna for threonine as in gas, but also trna for lysine  <cit> . interestingly, the organization of rd <dig> like element in gbs is strain dependent. in case of strains  <dig> and coh <dig>  almost the entire element is organized as in mgas <dig> with the exception of rib and its regulator , whereas in other strains only fragments homologous to rd <dig> are detected. the regions in s. agalactiae genomes homologous to genes m28_spy1303- m28_spy <dig> are located in majority of analyzed gbs strains within single chromosomal location, while genes m28_spy1326-m28_spy <dig> are located in other chromosomal location or locations .

rd <dig> encodes a putative conjugation module
based on dna sequence analysis, rd <dig> does not appear to encode genes involved in replication as a circular plasmid. gas is not considered to be naturally transformable under standard laboratory growth conditions, suggesting that other mechanisms must be used to transfer rd2-related genes between cells. dna sequence analysis identified a putative transfer module encoded by rd <dig> with similarity to the icest <dig> and icest <dig> conjugation modules present in streptococcus thermophilus   <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that rd <dig> uses a conjugation-like mechanism to transfer from donor to recipient strains. to test this hypothesis, we performed filter mating using donor strain mgas6180Δ1325-1326spcr, which contains a spectinomycin resistance cassette integrated into the chromosomal copy of rd <dig>  the recipient strain used was strain mgas <dig>  a type emm <dig> organism that is naturally resistant to erythromycin. after filter mating of strain mgas6180Δ1325-1326spcr and strain mgas <dig> for  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h, we obtained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> colonies, respectively , which were resistant to both antibiotics . eight putative transconjugant colonies were tested for the presence of the rd <dig> element and characterized for the emm gene sequence. in group a streptococcus, emm gene is highly polymorphic in sequence and encodes for major surface protein m that is responsible for gas serotype. amplification of hyper-variable region of emm gene with primers cdcemm <dig> and cdcemm <dig> yields products that differ in size depending on the m serotype  <cit> . rd <dig> positive transconjugants were first screened based on the emm amplicon size , and the amplified product was sequenced to confirm that transconjugants belong to m <dig> serotype, the same as the recipient. successful transfer of the rd <dig> element from the emm <dig> strain to the emm <dig> strain was confirmed by pcr tiling across the entire rd <dig> element . moreover, based on amplification of the junction region between rd <dig> and the chromosome, the rd <dig> element in the transconjugate was integrated at the same locus as in the donor emm <dig> strain . based on analysis of  <dig> colonies resistant to both spectinomycin and kanamycin, similar results were obtained using strain serotype m <dig> strain as the recipient strain .

rd <dig> is present in multiple, likely extrachromosomal, copies in gas
many gene transfer processes, including conjugation, require circular form of the transferred molecule or that more than one copy of the element exists during at least one point in the transfer cycle  <cit> . therefore, we tested the hypothesis that multiple copies of the rd <dig> are present in the bacterial cell. pcr primers were used that allow detection of a circular form of rd <dig>  and permit assessment of the orientation of chromosomal integration of multiple copies of rd <dig> . primers # <dig> and # <dig> recognize chromosomal sequences, whereas primers # <dig> and # <dig> recognize rd <dig> element sequences. depending on the direction and/or arrangement of multiple copies of rd <dig> , the different primer combinations would yield distinct amplicons. based on the genome sequence of strain mgas <dig>  <cit>  primer pairs #1-# <dig> and #3-# <dig> would amplify the junction region between the chromosome and rd <dig> on the left and right flank, respectively . using total dna isolated from an overnight culture of mgas <dig> as template, pcr analysis yielded products amplified with primers #1-# <dig> and #3-# <dig>  as expected. however, we also observed that primers # <dig> and # <dig> amplified a product, a result suggesting the presence of either multiple integrated copies of rd <dig> or a circular form of rd <dig> . next, we analyzed nine other gas strains of multiple m protein serotypes using primers #2-# <dig> to determine if this was a general phenomenon. regardless of emm type, all rd2-positive strains yielded an amplicon with the primer #2-# <dig> combination whereas rd2-negative organism did not . further, dna sequence analysis revealed that all pcr amplicons generated with primers #2-# <dig> contained the sequence cggtggtggca, corresponding to a junction between the left and right flanking regions of rd <dig> .

to further investigate the putative presence of multiple extrachromosomal copies of rd <dig> in gas cells, we performed quantitative real time pcr using total dna isolated from mgas <dig> strain. performed analysis revealed that rd <dig> is present in 6- <dig> copies per chromosome . also, the amplification of chromosomal junction  suggests that rd <dig> can be excised from the site of integration.

taken together, these results indicate that a circular form of rd <dig> is present in strain mgas <dig> 

response of strain mgas <dig> to mitomycin c and hydrogen peroxide treatment
we hypothesized that the putative circular form detected in overnight cultures  is a transient form involved in dna transfer. dna damaging factors as ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide, or mitomycin c can induce mobilization of genetic elements such as prophages or pathogenic islands as part of a response to dna damage or oxidative stress  <cit> . to test hypothesis that rd <dig> was induced/excised by dna damage and oxidative stress, we examined induction of rd <dig> and five other integrative elements present in the genome of strain mgas  <dig> by mitomycin c and hydrogen peroxide treatment.

in the absence of mitomycin c, no significant increase in target gene copy number of any of tested element occurred, even after overnight incubation , and the copy number of the element remained constant. however, rd <dig> copy number increased by  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h-post mitomycin c treatment . of note, we also detected increases in the copy number of genes encoded by several other integrative elements present in the genome of strain mgas <dig>  for example, all three tested prophages were induced. in the most dramatic case of prophage  <dig>   we observed a increase in relative copy number over  <dig> times compared with the pre-induction level . consistent with phage induction, mitomycin c treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in optical density of the culture, presumably corresponding to cell lysis .

treatment with hydrogen peroxide did not increase rd <dig> copy number , however we observed induction of phages such as  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

an rd2-like element is present in group c and g streptococcus strains
inasmuch as genome sequence information  and filter-mating data presented herein suggested that rd <dig> or an rd2-like element can spread between streptococcal species and multiple serotypes, we tested the hypothesis that the rd <dig> element has a phylogenetic distribution broader than gas and gbs. to test the hypothesis, we screened  <dig> group c  and g  streptococci causing human infections by pcr for the presence of seven rd <dig> genes encoding putative extracellular secreted proteins. the primers and conditions we used were based on the sequence of rd <dig> found in gas strain mgas <dig>  and have been used previously to study the distribution of rd <dig> in gas strains  <cit> . because specific primers were used, this pcr analysis tests for the presence of genes with high homology to the rd <dig> element in gas. the majority of the  <dig> gcs and ggs strains tested have homologs of rd <dig> element genes . dna sequencing of all pcr products confirmed that the amplified gene fragments were homologues of rd <dig> element genes . to test the hypothesis that the amplified genes were organized in an rd2-like genetic element, we used pcr primers described previously to tile across the entire rd <dig> element found in gas strains  <cit> . the results  show that two ggs strains had an intact rd <dig> element, and one gcs strain had large segments of an intact rd <dig>  the analysis also revealed a similar organization to rd <dig> in mgas <dig>  as amplicons of the same size were generated . missing products of tiling pcr of gcs encompass homologs of m28_spy <dig> and m28_spy <dig>  which genes detected in single pcr reactions . the failure to amplify pcr products corresponding to the junction sites between the chromosome and rd <dig> suggests that the element is located in a different chromosomal location than in gas. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that dna sequence divergence at the primer pairing site was responsible for the lack of amplification of the target amplicon.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
analysis of multiple genomes of gas shows that about 10% of the genome can be attributed to genetic material acquired horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . multiple mobile genetic elements as prophages, ice elements and ancient pathogenicity islands are part of gas metagenome  <cit> . lack of detected natural transformation of gas, despite proposed mechanism mediated via quorum sensing mechanism,  <cit>  stresses the importance of transduction and conjugation processes in hgt.

since late 1970s multiple authors were studying plasmid conjugal transfer between various streptococcal species  <cit> . later, based on sequence analyses and experimental rationale, horizontal transfer of genes/regions between gas and ggs was implied  <cit> . finally, recent publications report conjugative transfer of ice elements in human and animal isolates of gas, gbs, ggs, gcs and streptococcus uberis  <cit> .

our work demonstrates that genetic element rd <dig> from gas strain mgas <dig>  can be horizontally transferred in the laboratory to other gas strains by filter mating. the transfer frequency is comparable with inter-species transfer of icest <dig>  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude that the transfer frequency was influenced by the inactivation of m28_spy1325- <dig> genes. the genes encode putative extracellular proteins and can act as aggregation factors, in particular, m28_spy <dig> has homology to enterococcal conjugative plasmid pam <dig> aggregation factor  <cit> . however, because we used filter mating technique that can at least partially circumvent the need of aggregation factor in the conjugation process, the lack of m28_spy1325- <dig> genes does not have to affect transfer frequency during filter mating.

presented study provides experimental support for the idea that the presence of rd <dig> in gas strains of very diverse phylogenetic backgrounds that have not shared a recent common ancestor have acquired this element by lateral gene flow occurring in nature. our results also show that rd2-like regions are present in multiple lancefield group c and group g strains, additional evidence for horizontal dissemination of rd <dig> in natural populations of streptococci. of note, the detection of an rd2-like element in group b  <cit> , c and g streptococci  is consistent with early reports of the production of the r <dig> antigen in these organisms  <cit> .

we believe that rd <dig> has spread and been maintained in genetically diverse organisms in part because proteins encoded by this genetic element confer a survival advantage to the recipient organism. rd <dig> encodes at least seven proteins that are secreted into the extracellular environment, including several likely to participate in host-pathogen interactions such as cell adhesion. it is plausible that at least two of these proteins confer a survival premium. the best characterized is protein r <dig> encoded by m28_spy <dig>  the rd <dig> protein has been shown to promote adhesion of gas to human epithelial cells grown in vitro and confer protective immunity in a mouse model of invasive disease, together providing evidence that the r <dig> protein is a virulence factor  <cit> . another rd <dig> encoded gene involved in virulence is m28_spy <dig>  the protein is a member of the antigen i/ii family of adhesions made by oral streptococci. it is made in vivo during invasive gas infection, and binds gp <dig>  a heavily glycosylated protein present in human saliva  <cit> . similar to the r <dig> protein, immunization with recombinant purified m28_spy <dig> protect mice from experimental invasive infection, and the protein is made during human invasive infections  <cit> . although far less is known about the other secreted extracellular proteins made by rd <dig>  serologic analysis indicates that m28_spy <dig>  m28_spy <dig> and m28_spy <dig> also are made during human invasive infections  <cit> .

although our work did not define the exact molecular mechanism mediating horizontal gene transfer of rd <dig>  the structure of the element and its transfer by filter mating point toward conjugation as a key process. parts of rd <dig> share substantial homology with icest <dig>  <cit>  and icest <dig>  <cit>  conjugative elements from s. thermophilus. icest <dig> and icest <dig> elements have homology in sequence and organization with conjugative transposon tn <dig> from enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . interestingly, a large intergenic region between m28_spy <dig> and m28_spym28_spy <dig> orfs contains multiple palindromic sequences and might function as origin of transfer  as the equivalent region of tn <dig> has been shown  <cit>  or has been suggested to function as such  <cit> .

we note that the copy number of rd <dig> increased rapidly and substantially following treatment of strain mgas <dig> with mitomycin c, a dna damaging agent known to induce the sos response and stimulate horizontal transfer of ices  <cit> .

interestingly, ubeda et al. have reported that other factors as antibiotic treatment can mediate sos response in staphylococci and promote horizontal dissemination of pathogenicity island-encoded virulence factor genes  <cit> . the postulated mechanism of sos-induced induction and transfer of icest1/ <dig> elements involves autoproteolysis of ci type repressor arp <dig>  <cit> . as the rd <dig> element encodes multiple ci type repressors  <cit>  it is plausible that the mechanism of rd <dig> induction is mediated by sos-induced proteolysis or autoproteolysis of one of the rd <dig> ci regulators. the induction of rd <dig> was not observed after treatment with hydrogen peroxide i.e. in the condition of oxidative stress that is known to induce phages  <cit> . that suggests rather lexa dependent mechanism induced by dna damage.

in conclusion, rd <dig> is a medium host range mobile element that is shared between multiple unrelated serotypes of gas and other pathogenic streptococcal species. as a consequence of several extracellular secreted proteins encoded by rd <dig>  the element may confer a selective advantage on organisms that acquire this element by horizontal gene transfer.
