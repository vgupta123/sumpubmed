BACKGROUND
pigeonpea  millsp.) is one of the important legume crops of rainfed agriculture in the semi-arid tropics. the indian subcontinent, eastern africa and central america, three main pigeonpea producing regions of the world cultivates pigeonpea either as a sole crop or intermixed. as pigeonpea contains high level of protein and some essential free amino acids like methionine, lycine and tryptophan, the importance of the pigeonpea to world vegetarian population is very significant. in india, pigeonpea is second most important legume after chickpea and alone contributes  <dig> % of world cultivated area with  <dig> % of world production  <cit> . the accelerated susceptibility of pigeonpea to diseases in indian subcontinent is one of the main roots of its deteriorating productivity.

phytophthora blight , caused by phytophthora cajani is an emerging disease in pigeonpea  <cit> . information on total economic losses in india caused by pb is not available, but the disease is of rising importance since last a few years and has the potential to cause 100% yield losses in field conditions under favourable environment. occurrence and widespread distribution of pb has been reported in areas especially when excessive rains fall within a short span of time and hot and humid weather persists during the crop season  <cit> . there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge on available resistant genotypes to p. cajani  <cit> .

identification of phytophthora species by conventional diagnostic tests abased on morphology, and growth on selective media is time consuming, laborious and takes considerable skill. in addition, taxonomic expertise is required for correct identification within the closely related species. again the prospective for quantification of biomass of pathogen is limited. in this regard, the aim of the study was also to develop a rapid, highly specific and very sensitive method for the potential quantification of p. cajani. the polymerase chain reaction  has long been used to detect the pathogens and is a highly sensitive and relatively fast method that allows detecting specific target dna molecules in a complex mixture, offering an alternative to microbiological conventional procedures in fungal diagnostic. one of the most important factors in the development of such molecular methods is the reliability of the primer set and the targeted dna sequence of interest organism  <cit> . nuclear rdna including the small and large subunits,  <dig> s and the internal transcribed spacer  region, proved to be an ideal target for specific pcr primers, as each sequences is variable at the family, genus or species level  <cit> . the its region has been shown to be largely conserved within phytophthora spp. but differ across species  <cit> . most importantly, sequence information is available in this region for nearly all known species of phytophthora  <cit> . consequently, we designed p. cajani specific primers within the its region. the current technique has the further advantage of being able to be performed as real-time pcr, visualized using an intercalating dye such as sybr green. real-time pcr allows products to be distinguished based not only size but also on sequence, because melt temperatures will differ for same size but distinct products  <cit> .

in order to establish a successful method for in vitro infection of p. cajani, a standardised protocol is needed to culture at its pathogenic state and to isolate the zoospores. however, knowledge about the conditions which govern infection by zoospores of p. cajani is yet unknown. several workers have described inoculation techniques using mycelium  <cit> , sporangium  <cit>  and zoospores  <cit>  for obtaining infection with phytophthora spp.; however p. cajani being a putatively novel species, very limited information about laboratory protocols are available. further, amin et al.  <cit>  recognized that p. cajani resembled p. drechsleri but noted that p. cajani produced larger sporangia and undifferentiated sporangiophores. they also considered that the homothallic nature of p. cajani differentiated it from p. drechsleri, which is considered to be heterothallic according to savage et al.  <cit> . however, kannaiyan et al.  <cit>  expressed the opinion that pb caused by p. drechsleri var. cajani and p. cajani are probably the same. detailed descriptions for both these pathogens have been provided in phytophthora diseases worldwide by erwin and ribeiro  <cit> . in current study, attempts have been made to establish an in planta infection system of p. cajani in pigeonpea.

host and pathogens are influenced by the interactive effects of multiple climatic factors. if any one of the factors of disease triangle  is altered, changes in the progression of a disease epidemic can occur  <cit> . high humidity, rising temperature, elevated co <dig> and depletion of o <dig>  all is events of imperative deviations in atmospheric components. changes in these important climatic factors play a direct or/and indirect role in changes of pathosystem and in disease expression  <cit> . anthropogenic emissions are drastically increasing the concentration of atmospheric co <dig>  as in  <dig> atmospheric co <dig> was 280 ppm has increased to 400 ppm in  <dig> and the projected concentration to be <dig> ppm by  <dig>  <cit> . elevated co <dig> directly alters growth, development, metabolism and plant physiology which, in turn, has an impact on pathogen invasion and disease progress  <cit> . elevated co <dig> can also modify plant–pathogen interactions primarily through changes in host plants  <cit> .

till now it is not clear in the literature, whether the disease severity is enhanced or diminished by a higher co <dig>  the study of thompson and drake  <cit>  showed that elevated co <dig> reduced powdery mildew  on wheat and the severity of rust  on c <dig> sedge  grey. on the other side, higher temperature and increased co <dig> concentration are also posing higher threat by increasing fungal disease perception namely late blight of potato, rice blast and sheath blight. in this context, there is a need to study effect of elevated co <dig> on phytophthora blight of pigeonpea, as in the last decade the disease dynamics of pigeonpea has changed drastically in india.

the overall objective of the study was to  standardize protocol for isolation and infection of p. cajani,  assess the effect of elevated atmospheric concentration of co <dig> on pb development and  quantify p. cajani during in planta infection.

RESULTS
isolation of phytophthora
pigeonpea plants with typical symptoms of phytophthora blight were sampled from the infected fields of multiple locations of two different states of india during 2012- <dig> and 2013– <dig>  blight symptoms included brown to dark brown lesions distinctly different from healthy green portions on main stem, branches and petioles. these lesions sometimes elongate and cause girdle and cracks on the stems. varying levels of pb incidence was recorded in surveyed locations  irrespective of years. there was no effect of soil type on pb incidence . a total of  <dig> isolates of phytophthora , one isolate from varanasi-uttar pradesh, one isolate from each district of mahbubnagar and adilabad of telangana state and rest  <dig> isolates from different experimental fields  of icrisat were obtained . the pure culture of the isolates was maintained on 20% tomato extract agar media at 15 ± 1°c in dark condition.table  <dig>

morphological identification
the growth pattern, mycelium structure and sporangial morphology of the individual isolates of phytophthora were examined under microscope for identification of the species. pathogen formed distinct colonies in rosaceous, stellate or cottony pattern irrespective of isolates. the mycelium of the isolates was coenocytic and branched. some isolates formed hyphal swellings on v <dig> agar. karyotyping of the isolates showed single or pair of nuclei within the hyphae. sporangium produced by different isolates varied in structure from broadly ovoid, obpyriform to elongate and non papilate. based on morphological characters, the pathogen was identified as phytophthora cajani . amphigynous anthredia were also observed and resembled to phytophthora cajani as given in the manual of phytophthora: identifying species by morphology and dna fingerprints  <cit> .figure  <dig>

molecular characterization
to confirm the p. cajani at molecular level, the its sequence of  <dig> s rdna of the  <dig> isolates was amplified and sequenced. the sequences were purified and were used in a blastn against the phytophthora database . the blast result confirmed the identity of the isolates as p. cajani. the sequences were deposited under the genbank . the pair-wise nucleotide sequence identity matrix showed 99-100% sequence identity among the isolates. the phylogenetic relationship among the isolates and as well as with other phytophthora spp. was made based on nucleotide sequences of its region. in phylogenetic tree, it was found that all the isolates of p. cajani were grouped together in the same clade with the nearest relative p. sojae isolate. there was no phylogenetic discordance within the p. cajani isolates .figure  <dig>

zoospores production and in planta infection
pathogenicity of all the  <dig> isolates was tested individually on the susceptible cultivar of pigeonpea icp  <dig>  the pathogenicity of the isolates was tested on  <dig> seedlings. the complete mortality of seedlings was recorded two days after the inoculation. lesions were seen on the stem and whole seedlings collapsed within 6– <dig> days after inoculation. all the  <dig> isolates were found to be virtually equal pathogenic to host icp  <dig> . the p. cajani isolate icpc  <dig> was taken to develop a method for zoospores production and in planta infection as it had shown consistent susceptible reaction. we developed the reproducible method for zoospore production from p. cajani and the method of inoculation for rapid screening for resistance to pb in pigeonpea genotype. the zoospores produced by p. cajani isolate icpc  <dig> were measured under haemocytometer and inoculum concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> zoospores per ml was found to be optimum for pb development. the symptoms started after 2 days of inoculation and 100% seedling mortality was recorded at 3– <dig> days post inoculation. un-inoculated plants did not show any disease symptom throughout the tests.

pb incidence under elevated co2
incubation period, measured as the time in days between inoculation and disease symptoms was significantly delayed under elevated co <dig> as compared to ambient . pb symptoms appeared after 30 hours of inoculation under ambient condition, after 36 hours under elevated co <dig> levels of 550 ppm and 40 hours under 700 ppm but, it was observed that disease progressed faster under elevated co <dig> as compared to ambient. no significant effect of ambient and elevated co <dig> concentrations on pb disease incidence was observed after a certain period of inoculation  .figure  <dig>

development of qpcr for the quantification of phytophthora cajani
specificity of the primers
the specificity of the qpcr primers designed from its sequences of ribosomal dna was assessed using dna from targeted phytophthora and non-targeted other fungal species such as fusarium udum, macrophomina sp, alternaria alternata. the assessment showed that the specific primers, qpcr_f <dig> and qpcr_r <dig> used in this study only amplified 146 bp pcr products from targeted species, p. cajani . the pcr product was sequenced and sequence obtained from the amplicon was aligned with targeted sequence. specificity of the primers was confirmed by its 100% similarity with p. cajani. no signal was generated from any non-targeted fungal pathogen indicating excellent specificity and sensitivity of the primers.table  <dig>

the standard curve
a standard curve was generated by plotting the cycle threshold value  versus the logarithm of the concentration of each serial dilution of dna in a  <dig> fold over a 7-log range from  <dig> to 1 × 10−4 ng/μl. a good correlation was observed between ct values and dna concentration of standard. the slope of linear regression curve was − <dig>  with the correlation coefficient r2 =  <dig>  demonstrating the pcr efficiency of  <dig> %  therefore, the standard curve obtained in this study indicated that the nominated primer was highly specific over a linear series of magnitude.figure  <dig>

the dissociation analysis showed that the sybr® green consistently generated a single peak at  <dig> °c in the pcr reactions, demonstrating the presence of only one specific product in the reaction . the developed qpcr system was used to analyse the amount of p. cajani dna present in an unknown sample by interpolating its ct value against the standard curve. the qpcr sensitivity result showed at least  <dig>  pg fungal dna was needed for a positive signal in reaction for sybr-green detection .

phytophthora cajani colonization under elevated co2
fungal colonization was delayed with the increase of co <dig> concentration. in ambient condition, the fungal dna reached to the minimum detection limit  <dig>  pg in  <dig>  ng of host plant dna after 20 h of the inoculation with zoospores. in case of elevated co <dig> concentration of 550 ppm and 700 ppm, the fungal colonization was detected at 27 h post inoculation. the amount of fungal dna was found to be increased in the host tissues with the time period. the maximum fungal colonization was recorded at 72 h of post inoculation. in ambient, the maximum  <dig>  ng of p. cajani dna was detected within the  <dig>  ng root dna of pigeonpea, whereas  <dig>  ng and  <dig>  ng fungal dna was measured within the  <dig>  ng root dna of the plants grown in 550 ppm and 750 ppm co <dig>  respectively . no cross reactivity was found with non-inoculated plant samples.figure  <dig>

discussion
we studied the effect of elevated co <dig> on pb of pigeonpea. the study included isolation and molecular characterisation of phytophthora cajani and simultaneously developing a standard protocol for zoospore production and reliable inoculation method for in planta infection process. our current study documented first time the molecular identification of p. cajani on pigeonpea and further quantified the p. cajani in pigeonpea seedlings grown under ambient and elevated co <dig> 

the its sequence of rdna is the most proposed dna region in molecular fungal ecology and has been recommended as the sole universal fungal barcode for fungi  <cit> . for phytophthora spp., its have been shown to be useful for species identification, although some related species share identical its sequences  <cit> . in addition, universal its <dig> and its <dig> primers that has been widely used in most of the labs, was successfully used in this study to identify the p. cajani from the isolated fungal samples. in the current study, fourteen p. cajani isolates were identified and characterised at molecular level using its <dig> and its <dig> primers from different locations of india. although p. cajani is a novel species, phylogenetic relationship of p. cajani with the other taxa of phytophthora based on nucleotide sequence is now well recognized. in our study, it was found that all  <dig> p. cajani isolates grouped into same clade with nearest relative p. sojae. based on dna distance analysis of the combined its <dig>   <dig> s subunit, and its <dig> regions of the genomic ribosomal rna tandem gene repeat, cooke et al.  <cit>  showed that p. cajani placed into clade 7b where the nearest relative p. sojae does belong. there was no discordance phylogenetic relationship noted within the isolates.

phytophthora species are notorious oomycete pathogen that causes diseases through wide range of inoculum, e.g. mycelium, sporangia, oospore and zoospore. a suitable protocol is required in order to establish a successful infection in planta. several researchers have worked on different phytophthora species to enable an efficacious and repeatable method for in planta infection, but for phytophthora sp. on pigeonpea, none of the methods tested in the past have been found consistently reliable . various methods reported for screening phytophthora in different crops included; in vitro leaf disk infection of brussels sprout plants  by infectious zoospores of p. brassicae  <cit> ; root dip of pea in zoospore suspension of p. pisi  <cit> ; leaf detached method in nicotiana tabacum for p. parasitica var. nicotianae  <cit> ; germination of soybean seeds in soil supplemented with zoospores suspension of p. megasperma var. sojae  <cit>  and rapid radicle assay in pepper  for p. capsici  <cit>  etc. but no effective screening technique was reported for resistant selection of pigeonpea to p. cajani. this is the first time we have established a successful method for obtaining high concentrations of zoospores followed by its use for standardization of inoculation technique in pigeonpea. use of zoospores to establish in planta infection is convenient and suitable to carry out small and large scale inoculation experiments. testing of previously published techniques  <cit>  with various alterations was carried out, including those found useful for other phytophthora species to develop a suitable method for obtaining high concentrations of p. cajani zoospores. finally, we were successful in developing a repeatable, reliable and economical screening technique using zoospore suspension for pb development.

visual estimation of infection in the field is time-consuming. furthermore, clear differentiation of the phytophthora species based on morphology requires expert knowledge. however, with the advent of real-time pcr, plant pathologist possesses the unprecedented ability to accurately quantify the specific pathogen within a host plant  <cit> . since last one decade efforts have been made in detection and quantification of various plant pathogens e.g. macrophomina phaseolina  <cit> , phytoplasma  <cit> , different fusarium species  <cit> , phytophthora species  <cit> . in this study, real-time pcr assay based on sybr green chemistry was developed for p. cajani quantification.

to determine the effect of elevated co <dig> on colonization and disease establishment by p. cajani in pigeonpea, we targeted  <dig> s rdna to quantify the fungal dna in host tissue. the sensitivity of the assay was determined using dilution series of pure dna of known concentration from the p. cajani. in general, the detection limit was  <dig>  pg per  <dig>  ng of host dna. the reproducibility of the real time assay was evaluated for initial dna content, presence of pcr inhibitors etc. the low variation between assays and single pick in melting curve indicated high reproducibility of the real-time pcr. however, the variation was eliminated by normalizing samples with the control.

we observed delayed colonization of p. cajani and disease establishment under elevated co <dig>  however, pigeonpea seedlings showed no significant difference in disease incidence under elevated and ambient co <dig> levels. the amount of fungal dna was found to be increased in the host tissues with the time period and was more in ambient as compared to elevated co <dig>  however, it is not clear that reduction of fungal growth performance is because of negative effects of elevated co <dig> on fungal performance. tomato plants showed increased tolerance to infection by phytophthora parasitica at elevated  <dig> μmmol− <dig> of co <dig>  the results suggested that more vegetative growth in aerial parts and as well as in root systems under higher co <dig> might have reimbursed the loss of growth caused by the root pathogen  <cit> . reduction of powdery mildew  on wheat and barley and the severity of rust  are also reported  <cit> . on the other side, higher threats of phytophthora infestans in potato and diseases of rice, like blast  and sheath blight  is increased day to day due to elevated co <dig> concentration and higher temperature  <cit> . for instances, it was found that in vitro exponential growth rates of phyllosticta minima, a maple fungal pathogen were enhanced by 17% under elevated co <dig>  discounting the possibility that disease reductions by elevated co <dig>  <cit> .

increased co <dig> levels can influence both the host and the pathogen in various means. under elevated co <dig>  sometimes internal physiological adjustment occurs in plant systems that alter sugar concentration, c:n ratio by producing phenolics compounds in the cells and nutritive quality may lead to unfavourable condition for growth of pathogenic organism and reduced the disease severity. in few study, it was found that elevated co <dig> increased the thickening of the roots in plants by more production of root border cells  <cit>  and lead to the increased amounts of root exudates into the rhizodeposition  <cit> . the fungal penetration also inhibit in root cells due to thickening of cell walls by deposition in root due to elevated co <dig>  these changes make the environment more favourable for plant defence. as elevated co <dig> directly involve in change of the vegetative growth of the plants, it is assumed that the amendment of the auxin, cytokinin ratio in plant cells also occurs simultaneously. it is reported that the auxin content modulates the infectivity of phytophthora parasitica in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, our further study is aimed to investigate the effect of elevated co <dig> coupled with other climate variables such as temperature on pb of pigeonpea and investigate the expression of resistance at biochemical level.

CONCLUSIONS
little is known concerning the isolation method and the infection by zoospores of phytophthora cajani, being a novel species on pigeonpea. the study included isolation and molecular characterisation of p. cajani and simultaneously established a standard protocol for zoospore production and in planta inoculation technique via isolated zoospores. the zoospore inoculation will facilitate the epidemiological studies and thus will be useful for developing a rapid and reliable screening technique against phytophthora blight of pigeonpea. qpcr had allowed detection and quantification of p. cajani in samples with low pathogen densities. no significant effect of elevated co <dig> on pb of pigeonpea was observed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of molecular identification of p. cajani, zoospore inoculation method and real-time pcr application used to assess the extent of colonization by p. cajani during disease development in pigeonpea.
