BACKGROUND
functional modules are basic units of cells that consist of molecules that work together to perform a desired biological function. the investigation of functional modules facilitates the understanding of the organization, regulation and execution of cell processes. currently, several functional modules have been computationally extracted from the structural characteristics of biological networks, such as the transcriptional regulation networks, protein-protein interaction networks and metabolic networks  <cit> . however, these studies have mainly been performed on single networks, and cooperation between different types of networks is seldom considered.

the global cell network integrates single networks  <cit> , such as the one governing transcriptional regulation, that appear to interact, rather than operate independently  <cit> . recently, substantial cooperative structures called composite motifs have been discovered within integrated networks  <cit> , and show functionally relatedness  <cit> . these composite motifs include two nodes, three nodes and four nodes motifs, such as composite pairs of co-transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interaction . three reports  <cit>  showed that composite pairs of ct-ppi  played important roles in cell function, especially in protein complexes which were also one kind of functional modules. but not all protein complexes are with high consistency between co-transcriptional regulation interactions  and protein-protein interactions . using yeast as model, nicolas simonis et al <cit>  and kai tan et al <cit>  discovered that protein complexes in the cell were not significant co-regulated.

thus, we wished to investigate cooperation among different networks in a higher network structure hierarchy. in this work, we investigated the composite functional module of co-transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interaction , and explored its structural and functional characteristics. co-transcriptional regulation interactions  and protein-protein interactions  are basic regulatory structures of transcriptional regulation and protein function. our results showed that cts and ppis were highly consistent within the ct-ppi modules, indicating the important role of ct-ppi modules in cooperation between transcriptional regulation and implementation of protein function. we detected  <dig> ct-ppi modules that participated in essential cell processes including the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, rna splicing, and dna-dependent positive transcription regulation.

RESULTS
we constructed an s. cerevisiae integrated network of  <dig> nodes and  <dig>  links . in figure  <dig>  nodes represent genes, and coloured edges represent different types of links. genes with the same go annotation were regarded as a functional module, for a total of  <dig> functional modules in the integrated network which contained  <dig> cellular component  term and  <dig> biological process  term.

structural significance and functional coherence of composite ct-ppi pairs
composite pairs of ct-ppi  are basic units that represent consistency between cts and ppis in the integrated network. and the presentation of c-pairs was different in our work and works reported before  <cit>  , for the integrated network was comprised by ct network and ppi network in our work but was comprised by ppi and transcriptional regulation interaction  network in theirs'. we thought it could make the composite structure of c-pairs  more concise  and help us detect ct-ppi modules with this presentation. c-pairs behaved as composite motifs in the integrated network because they occurred significantly more often than random , this result also demonstrated the work reported before  <cit> .

however, they also behaved as functionally coherent units. a c-pair was considered to be functionally coherent if both genes were annotated under the same go term. using a background of general  or narrow  annotations, and considering only cc and bp branches, we compared the functional coherence fraction of  <dig> c-pairs to  <dig>  ct pairs, and  <dig> ppi pairs. a higher fraction of the c-pairs were functionally coherent, than the ct and ppi pairs .

this result demonstrated that the cooperation between cts and ppis had important network structure and cell function effects. we searched for additional ct-ppi modules and investigated their characteristics.

detecting ct-ppi modules
functional modules in single networks are usually detected from "structure to function", meaning that modules are searched first by network, then by functional annotation analysis  <cit> . we chose a "function to structure" method to detect ct-ppi modules by first defining the functional module, and then conducting topological analysis for consistency between ct and ppi sub-networks. the detail is shown in figure  <dig>  first, we constructed an integrated network of cts and ppis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. proteins were grouped into different functional modules according to their gene ontology  annotations  <cit> . finally, we used a network structure comparison mantel test  <cit>  to detect ct-ppi modules by their structural consistency between ct and ppi sub-networks in a given functional module.

we obtained  <dig> functional modules with a significant r value. we investigated the structural consistency of these functional modules to detect ct-ppi modules.

association between structural consistency and functional hierarchy of ct-ppi modules
the structural consistency of ct-ppi modules was associated with their functional annotation hierarchy. we paired  <dig> of the  <dig> functional modules into  <dig> ascendant/descendant functional module pairs, with  <dig> excluded for lacking a relationship, according to their ascendant/descendant relationship in go. except for the go:0009165-go: <dig> pair, r values of the descendant function modules were greater than those of the ascendant modules . go: <dig> and go: <dig> shared the same number  of c-pairs, but the inconsistency of the other cts and ppis in go: <dig> influenced the r value more than in go: <dig>  we used  <dig>  as the threshold  <cit>  for consistency between ct and ppi sub-networks of functional modules and obtained  <dig> functional modules. all r values were higher in the descendant, than in the ascendant functional modules. choosing the descendent and isolated modules  yielded  <dig> ct-ppi modules .

global structural consistency of ct-ppi modules
c-pairs are the basic elements and locally consistent structures between cts and ppis in the integrated network. they also play important roles in the construction of ct-ppi modules, as ct-ppi modules were enriched with c-pairs . in fact, ct-ppi modules were detected from the global consistency of ct and ppi sub-networks, rather than the local consistency .

considering only local consistency generated many functional modules enriched with c-pairs. of  <dig> functional modules containing c-pairs in the integrated network,  <dig> were enriched with c-pairs . this relatively large number changed little as p decreased, so that even at p <  <dig> Ã— 10- <dig>   <dig> functional modules were still found to be enriched with c-pairs , although this level of cooperation between cts and ppis associated with cell functions is implausible . in addition, no clear relationship between p , and the functional hierarchy of such functional modules was found .

structure compactness of ct-ppi modules
in single networks, links between genes in a module are more compact than links to genes in other modules  <cit> . if the inner link density cin, was greater than the outer link density cout, we considered the module compact . compactness analysis of the functional modules separated the integrated network into ct and ppi networks, then examined the compactness of these sub-networks of functional modules. if both sub-networks were compact, we considered the integrated sub-network compact.

compared with functional modules in the integrated network, and those enriched for c-pairs , ct-ppi modules were more compact . of  <dig> ct-ppi modules,  <dig> were compact in the integrated network . this fraction  was much higher than the functional modules in the integrated network , and in those enriched for c-pairs . this showed that ct-ppi modules were not only modules in function, but showed modular behaviour in structure.

ct-ppi modules involved in essential functions
the nine structurally compact ct-ppi modules were annotated for oxidative phosphorylation , a critical metabolic pathway that produces adenosine triphosphate. the go annotations of the  <dig> functional modules were closely related to the oxidative phosphorylation process. and the nine oxidative phosphorylation ct-ppi modules were closely related in structure, sharing 164/ <dig> c-pairs, where the numerator is the total number of c-pairs, and the denominator is the number of unique c-pairs in the nine ct-ppi modules. these ct-ppi modules were combined and their  <dig> genes annotated by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> , showing again that these genes were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway . furthermore, when we annotated the corresponding genes for the  <dig> unique c-pairs,  <dig> annotated in complexes iii, iv or v of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, while the corresponding genes number is  <dig>  ydl181w lacked an annotation in the kegg pathway system.

*the number in () represent the c-pairs of ct-ppi regulated by the tf.

we investigated the transcriptional factors  regulating the c-pairs in the nine compact ct-ppi modules. although many tfs regulated more than one gene in the nine ct-ppi modules, only hap <dig> regulated c-pairs . this suggested that hap <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, especially complexes iii, iv and v, consistent with a previous report  <cit> .

ct-ppi modules go: <dig> and go: <dig> appeared to affect rna splicing, and shared tf genes ste <dig> and dig <dig> with the ct-ppi modules go: <dig> . however, the term description of go: <dig> in go shows it plays roles in "the positive regulation of transcription, dna-dependent". transcription and rna splicing are time-sequential, so shared tfs ensures the coordination of these two processes. we conclude that these ct-ppi modules participate in transcription, which, if interrupted, prevents successful production of mrna and protein.

ct-ppi modules go: <dig> and go: <dig> both appeared to have roles in dna structure changes in meiosis. ct-ppi modules go: <dig> annotated as "nuclear chromatin", which is also involved in the chromosome formation. these three ct-ppi modules seemed to be involved in the maintenance and transmission of genetic material.

the above analysis shows that ct-ppi modules are involved in essential eukaryote cellular functions. their network structure, evaluated as consistency of ct and ppi, reflects the cooperation of transcriptional regulation and implementing protein function, with this type of structure ensuring stable regulation. the network characteristic of ct-ppi modules ensures the stable regulation of their functions.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that cooperation between ct and ppi is important to cell regulation. ct-ppi modules, which reflect the cooperation between ct and ppi in a module, were involved in essential cell functions. in addition, c-pairs, which reflected cooperation between ct and ppi motifs, were functionally coherent.

our results also suggest that the structure and function of ct-ppi modules are closely related. their network structure appeared to be conserved, as it coordinated two basic regulatory structures . this type of structure could help ensure the stability of essential functions. structural consistency and functional hierarchy in ct-ppi modules were associated, with their both functional and structural modularity. these findings reflect a close relationship between the structure and function of ct-ppi modules and show the complexity of cell regulation.

many studies have investigated the relationship between the structure and function of special structures within networks, but findings have differed and the relationships have been ambiguous  <cit> . in eukaryotes, cell networks have undergone evolutionary pressure for billions of years, generating special structures. molecular evolution hypothesizes that most evolutionary events behave non-directionally, so special structures that occur in the network do not always carry out corresponding functions. therefore, we propose that investigating the biological meaning implied in the structures before exploring their functions is the most logical method of studying network structures.
