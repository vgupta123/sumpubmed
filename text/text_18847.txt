BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei  and burkholderia mallei  are gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogens that cause melioidosis and glanders, respectively  <cit> . bp causes disease in both humans and animals in the endemic areas of southeastern asia and northern australia  <cit> . infection with bp can occur via percutaneous inoculation, injection or inhalation of aerosolized bacteria or contaminated fluids  <cit> . clinical signs of melioidosis may manifest as flu-like symptoms, pneumonia, or fulminating septicemia that are often fatal  <cit> . both chronic and acute forms of melioidosis have been reported and the pathogen can colonize a diverse range of tissues including liver, spleen, lung, skin and even the urinary tract.

bm is a non-motile, obligate mammalian pathogen that is closely related at the genetic level to the much more diverse species bp  <cit> . the pathogen is endemic among domestic animals in africa, asia, the middle east and central and south america  <cit> . horses are the natural reservoir for bm, but mules and donkeys are also susceptible  <cit> . equine infections are caused by consumption of water or feed contaminated with nasal discharge from infected equines, but a cutaneous form of the disease, known as farcy, also exists. human infection is primarily caused by direct contact with an infected animal’s nasal discharge or skin lesion exudates  <cit> . in humans, glanders is characterized initially by the onset of fever, rigors and malaise, rapidly leading to pneumonia, bacteremia, pustules and abscesses. due to the highly infectious nature of bp and bm, in particular for exposure by the aerosol route, both pathogens are considered potential biological warfare threat agents and are classified by the federal select agent program as tier  <dig> select agents.

two other bp-like species that are closely related, at the genetic and physiological level, that have been reported are bo and bt  <cit> . bo was first isolated in oklahoma in  <dig> from the purulent discharge of a pelvic wound from a farmer that was involved in a tractor accident  <cit> . initially, bo was described as bp due to the similar metabolic and culture conditions but was differentiated from bp using serology and fatty acid composition analysis. bo is avirulent in hamster and mouse models  <cit> . bt cdc <dig> and bt cdc <dig> were isolated from patient samples in louisiana and texas, respectively. although both bt cdc <dig> and bt cdc <dig> originated from human source in the united states of america, they displayed different in vivo pathogenicity profiles. it was demonstrated in syrian hamster model that bt cdc <dig> was avirulent whereas bt cdc <dig> had a virulence capacity that was very similar to the bt phuket 4 w- <dig> strain  <cit> . numerous differences between bp and bt were reported at the genetic, phenotypic, and pathogenic level . however, host responses to these pathogens have not been well characterized.

a characteristic feature of bp, bm, bt and bo pathogens is their ability to infect both phagocytic and nonphagocytic host cells  <cit> . the intracellular life cycle of these pathogens involves a coordinated interaction between the host and pathogen proteins that allows the bacteria to adhere and gain entry into the phagosomal compartment of the target cells  <cit> . disruption of the phagosomal membrane by bsa type iii secretion system  allows the bacteria to escape into the host cytosol, evade host innate responses and killing by autophagy. in the host cytoplasm, bacteria gain motility and spread from cell-to-cell via the polymerization of host actin; a process directed by the bacterial cell surface protein, bima . in contrast, bt can employ a cryptic  flagellar system and drive cell-to-cell spread in a bima independent manner  <cit> . the type vi secretion system  also plays a critical role in bacterial replication and intercellular spread by inducing fusion of the plasma membrane of the infected host cells to form multinucleated giant cells , a hallmark of burkholderia infection which has been observed in phagocytic, nonphagocytic cell lines and clinical glanders and melioidosis samples.  <cit> . the expression of the t3ss and t6ss is controlled by mechanisms such as tetr-type regulator, two component systems or quorum sensing . host pathogen recognition receptors  and their associated molecules such as toll-like receptors , nod-like receptors  and caspases play a pivotal role in burkholderia spp. infection . likewise, mcp- <dig>  interferon -γ, tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> are key cytokines that modulate bp and bm infection . host innate immune signaling cascades, however, can be counteracted by bacterial virulence factors. for example, bp encoded tssm downregulates host inflammatory responses by inhibiting nf-κb and type i ifn pathway activation  <cit> , while bopa is important for avoidance of autophagy  <cit> . similarly, cif homolog in bp  also abrogates nf-κb activation by deregulating iκbα degradation and p <dig> nuclear translocation  <cit> . although the interactions between burkholderia spp. and its hosts have been examined previously, host innate immune responses that are associated with individual strains of burkholderia spp. is lacking.

the goal of this study was to conduct systematic analyses of the host phenotypic alterations at the cellular level and immunological responses at the molecular level using a diverse collection of burkholderia spp. obtained from humans, animals, environment and geographically diverse locations. several strains used in this study have been previously characterized for their pathogenicity in vivo in mice or in the syrian hamster model of infection . measurement of phenotypic responses using conventional colony forming unit  assays and high-content imaging  assay demonstrated all burkholderia spp. were phagocytosed and replicated within raw <dig>  macrophages. bo e <dig> and bp  <dig> failed to induce mngcs whereas all other burkholderia spp. induced mngc to varying degrees. elevated production of il-1β, tnf-α and kc  cytokines was observed in all burkholderia spp. infected macrophages. on the contrary, the secretion of il- <dig> and il- <dig> was significantly higher in bm infected macrophages than that of bp. hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from  <dig> inflammation related genes revealed  <dig> genes as indicators of differential responses between burkholderia strains. further validation studies confirmed a significantly elevated bm mediated il-1b, il- <dig>  tnfrsf1b and il-36a mrna expressions compared to that with bp and bt. collectively, these multidisciplinary approaches provided a comprehensive assessment of the murine macrophage host response during different stages of infection with a diverse collection of burkholderia spp.

RESULTS
diverse burkholderia spp. are phagocytized and replicate within raw <dig>  macrophages
a diverse collection of bp , bm , bt  and bo  strains from various geographical locations throughout the world were examined in this study. available information on the ancestry of the strains along with their source, location, in vivo virulence profile and genome sequences is listed in table  <dig>  in addition, three mutants of bm atcc  <dig> strains with deletions in the genes encoding for capsule  or lipopolysaccharide   biosynthesis or both  were also evaluated. the ability of each strain to replicate within murine macrophages was determined by incorporating well-established kanamycin  protection assays . intracellular replication within raw <dig>  macrophages was monitored at  <dig>   <dig> and 8 h post infection for each burkholderia strains. the three bt strains cdc <dig>  phuket 4 w- <dig>  dw <dig> and bo e <dig> were internalized and able to replicate in raw <dig>  macrophages . among all the bp strains that were tested, no statistically significant differences were observed in the uptake and intracellular replication. however, macrophages infected with bp  <dig> showed a much-reduced uptake of these bacteria at 2 h post infection, followed by a robust replication at 4 h and subsequent drop at 8 h post infection . based on transmission electron microscopy  studies, a much reduced number of the bp  <dig> was observed in the cytosol compared to the reference strain bp k <dig> at the late time points  post infection, while very similar number of bacteria were observed within the membrane bound vesicles for both the strains . these studies suggest that differential escape rate from endosomal compartment may contribute to the observed phenotype. the uptake of all five bm strains was similar at the two hour time point. however, at the  <dig> and 8 h time points, differences were observed in the intracellular survival and replication but were not statistically significant . furthermore, the intracellular replication of the polar bm lps and capsule mutants was similar to that observed for bm atcc  <dig> .table  <dig> bacterial strains used in this investigation and macrophage phenotypes following infection

ability to induce macrophage mngc formation and exhibit actin tails varies between burkholderia spp. examined

several bacterial pathogens, including shigella, listeria, mycobacteria and burkholderia induce host cell actin tail formation on the bacterial surface to facilitate cell-to-cell spread, while evading the host immunological responses and promoting intracellular replication  <cit> . the three bt and four bm strains as well as all the nine bp strains  tested in this study were capable of inducing host actin polymerization and exhibiting actin tails on the bacterial surface. however, bo e <dig> and bm nctc  <dig> strains failed to exhibit actin tail formation on bacterial surface following infection .

burkholderia spp. infected raw <dig>  macrophages induce differential cytokine responses
previously, elevated il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α and ifn-γ concentrations have been associated with death among patients with melioidosis . in addition, il- <dig>  a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, was thought to have an important suppressive immune-regulatory role in the early stages of bp infection  <cit> . the ability of burkholderia spp. to modulate il-1β, tnf-α, kc, il- <dig> and il- <dig> production in raw <dig>  macrophages was investigated. all twenty-one strains of burkholderia spp. induced il-1β, tnf-α and kc production . notably, raw <dig>  macrophages infected with bm spp. resulted in significantly elevated levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> when compared with bp spp. infections . the production of il- <dig> was reduced in raw <dig>  macrophages infected with mutant bm strains  compared to cells infected with the parental bm atcc  <dig> strain. the observed difference in il- <dig> and il- <dig> production between bm and bp infected macrophages suggests the existence of distinct underlying molecular signaling cascades.fig.  <dig> profiling inflammation related cytokine production in raw <dig>  macrophages infected with burkholderia spp. a & b) raw <dig>  macrophages were infected with listed burkholderia spp. at a moi of  <dig>  eight hours post infection, the supernatants were harvested and the amount of indicated cytokines was quantified. unpaired student’s t-test was performed to evaluate the statistical significance between the species . all data shown is representative of n =  <dig> experiments



differential expression of inflammation related genes in burkholderia spp. infected raw <dig>  macrophages
genes encoding chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines are critical mediators of intracellular bacterial infection for in vivo and in vitro systems. to determine if the different burkholderia spp. modulate common or unique host immune responses, we examined the transcriptional profile of  <dig> inflammation related genes from raw <dig>  macrophages infected for  <dig> or 8 h with the diverse burkholderia strains. hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data separated burkholderia strains into eleven sub-clades, with distinct segregation between the early  and the late  infection times . sub-clustering within the early and late exposure times separated for the most part the bm, bp and bt strains. pairwise comparisons of host gene expressions at each exposure time were used to identify differences in the host responses to specific bp, bm and bt species. a student’s t statistic was computed and clustered heat map generated for the three pairwise gene expressions; bp-bt, bm-bt and bm-bp, using their corresponding pairwise differences between averaged gene expressions. twenty-nine host genes were identified as indicators of differential responses between the burkholderia spp. . statistical analysis demonstrated that bm collectively induced significantly higher expression of a gene cluster than bp and bt at 8 h post infection. the expression levels of a subset of genes, tnfrsf1b, il-1b, il-36a and il- <dig> were validated by real-time pcr using independently prepared samples . with the exception of bt cdc <dig>  the bm strains collectively showed statistically significant increased expression of tnfrsf1b, il-1b, il-36a and il- <dig> genes compared to the bp and the two bt strains. these results indicate that gene-based differences for burkholderia species are evident within the different components of the inflammatory response.fig.  <dig> differential expression of inflammation related genes following bp, bt and bm infection. raw <dig>  macrophages were infected with indicated burkholderia spp. at a moi of  <dig>  total mrna was purified and reverse transcribed to cdna. a panel of  <dig> pro-inflammatory genes was quantified using real time pcr. fold changes of gene expression are color coded, where red stands for high values and blue for low fold changes. implementation of manhattan distance calculation and a wards linkage analysis identified eleven clades, which are highlighted in red box. the data is average of three independent experiments

discussion
in vitro characterization of host responses to burkholderia infection at both the phenotypic and molecular level provides a rapid approach to gain insight into the intracellular lifestyle of both pathogenic and avirulent burkholderia strains. we characterized the host phenotypic responses by measuring each burkholderia strain’s capacity to a) invade and replicate in macrophages, b) induce host actin polymerization on bacterial surfaces and c) induce raw <dig>  macrophage mngc formation. all burkholderia spp. invaded and replicated within raw <dig>  macrophages, albeit to varying degrees. quantitation of mngc formation in infected macrophages revealed several bm  and bp  strains to exhibit a reduced capability of inducing this phenotype. there was no observed correlation between intracellular bacterial replication and reduced number of mngcs or actin tails. in vitro, bo e <dig> strain is not capable of inducing mngc phenotype, an observation similar to that reported by wand et al.  <cit> , and which in part could be due to its inability to polymerize host actin and thereby prevent the bacterial cell-to-cell spread. prior published studies suggest that the lack of wasp homology  <dig>  domain in bima and the absence of t3ss transcription regulators, bpss <dig>  and bpss <dig> , in bo may contribute to the observed phenotypes  <cit> . intriguingly, bp  <dig> did not induce macrophage mngc formation despite the detection of actin tail on the bacterial surface. due to the lack of genome sequence information for bp  <dig>  the genome integrity cannot be determined and hence difficult to correlate phenotype with genotype. bm nctc  <dig> did not exhibit actin tails, were trapped in endocytic compartments and showed much reduced capacity to induce mngcs. functional studies to correlate the bm  <dig> phenotype to genotype are ongoing.

intrinsic differences at the cellular level may contribute to differences in host susceptibility to burkholderia infection. for example, prior published studies have shown that c57bl/ <dig> mice are  <dig> to  <dig> fold more resistant to bp infection compared to balb/c mice  <cit> . furthermore, bone marrow-derived macrophages from c57bl/ <dig> mice can clear the bacteria more efficiently compared to those obtained from balb/c mice. in this study, since a uniformed in vitro system such as the raw <dig>  macrophages was used to characterize the host responses to burkholderia spp. infection, differences in the bacterial genome composition or mutations may contribute to the observed cellular phenotypes. in an attempt to correlate the pathogen induced host phenotypes to mutations in known bacterial virulence factors, comparative genomics analysis was conducted for the bm and bp strains whose genome sequences were available. a little over  <dig> loci were examined in each species . these encompassed loci that were important for the expressions of t3ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig>  actin motility, and several regulators of these systems including virag, bspr, bprp, bprq, bsan, and rpos. putative orthologs for these virulence genes were identified in all strains regardless of phenotype, and in most cases, the genes were 100 % identical at the nucleotide-level. even in cases where variability was detected, we failed to identify any mutations that would likely result in the loss of function. notably, bp  <dig> showed deletions in one locally repetitive region amounting in  <dig> deleted bases in bpss <dig> , as compared to bp k <dig> . although this deletion does not disrupt the coding frame, the functional consequences of this mutation need to be empirically determined. in addition, we cannot exclude the impact of  <dig> in silico identified t3ss proteins that may contribute to the virulence of burkholderia spp.  <cit> . the genome integrity and the function of these putative factors require further investigation. importantly, to generate a strong correlation between virulence and mngc/actin tail formation, a larger number of the burkholderia strains will need to be incorporated for in vivo virulence and in vitro phenotype studies.

cytokines produced during the course of burkholderia infection behave like a double-edged sword. select cytokines, while important for resistance to burkholderia infection, are also potential contributors to immunopathology  <cit> . infection of raw <dig>  macrophages with the different burkholderia spp. resulted in uniform increased secretion of il-1β, tnf-α and il- <dig>  however, macrophages infected with bm strains showed a statistically significant increased production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> compared to bp strains. the induction of il- <dig> cytokines was also observed in non-human primate  peripheral blood mononuclear cells  infected with bm or stimulated with bm derived lps  <cit> . further, gene expression profiling of eighty-four inflammation related genes identified  <dig> host genes that exhibited differential responses between the burkholderia strains. validation studies confirmed bm mediated increased expression of il-1b, il- <dig>  tnfrsf1b and il-36a host genes compared to bp.

in addition to the virulence factors, the bp genome encodes about  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> that are either not present or variant in bm. a majority of these genes function in amino acid, nitrate, tagatose, allantoin and cellobiose metabolism. in addition, several genes  are involved in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid  cycle  <cit> . recent studies have revealed that metabolites can regulate innate immune responses  <cit> . for example, stimulation of macrophages by lps, a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, upregulates succinate, a tca cycle intermediate. inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases  activity by succinate stabilizes hif-1α, a transcription factor that binds to the il-1β promoter and triggers il-1β production  <cit> . we hypothesize that the fundamental differences in the metabolic capabilities between bm and bp may affect the host metabolite profile and delineate the observed cytokine and gene expressions levels.

bp also activates host innate immune responses through two nlrs, nlrc <dig> and nlrp <dig>  <cit> . bp mediated nlrc <dig> activation induces pyroptosis that restricts intracellular bacterial growth whereas its engagement to nlrp3-inflammasome promotes il-1β production that may lead to tissue damage. nlrp <dig> has been suggested in multiple metabolic diseases  <cit> . in addition to pathogen associated molecular patterns, nlrp <dig> can also be activated by metabolic “danger” signals such as high levels of glucose, saturated fatty acids and ceramides that are typically associated with obese or diabetic individuals. since diabetes is a major risk factor of melioidosis, comparative analysis to characterize bp vs. bm mediated cytokine and gene expression changes will provide insight toward understanding of innate immunity and disease progression.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies provide a detailed analysis, at the cellular and immunological level, the ability of a diverse range of pathogenic and avirulent burkholderia strains to infect and trigger host immune responses in murine raw <dig>  macrophages. however, multiple challenges remain, as identifying gene sets or phenotypic alterations that can be used to profile the diverse burkholderia strains or species and generate characteristic molecular or cellular signatures, as described in this study, still require further investigation and validation. furthermore, a large number of the burkholderia strains will need to be evaluated for statistical analysis that will help generate characteristic signature profile linking the observed cellular or molecular phenotype to the source or geographical location at either the strain or species level or the virulence.
