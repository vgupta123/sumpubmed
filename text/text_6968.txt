BACKGROUND
neural stem cells  are a promising source for cell replacement therapies in the brain and the spinal cord  <cit> . it is common knowledge that nscs can be extracted from fetal brain  <cit>  or generated from embryonic stem cells  <cit> . furthermore, nscs can also be isolated from different regions of the adult brain such as the hippocampus and the subventricular zone and from some non-neurogenic regions such as the spinal cord  <cit>  or the periventricular regions of the whole neuroaxis  <cit> . nscs are able to replicate and generate all neuroectodermal lineages, namely neurons, astroglia and oligodendroglia  <cit> . during in vitro expansion, nscs grow in so-called "neurospheres" or adherent cultures. neurospheres are either multicellular aggregates or clones originating from one single cell depending on the cell density  <cit> . in previous studies, the isolation and successful long-term expansion of human nscs from the adult hippocampus, the adult olfactory bulb and adult post-mortem tissues have been reported  <cit> . in these studies, ahnscs have successfully been expanded for more than  <dig> population doublings using serum-free culture medium which is normally supplemented with the mitogenes epidermal growth factor  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig> . removal of the mitogenes leads to spontaneous differentiation of adult nscs into neurons, astroglia and oligondendroglia  <cit> .

investigations examining the influence of csf and its contents on survival, proliferation and differentiation of nscs were so far mostly performed with embryonic avian csf  <cit> . in these investigations, nscs cultured in csf showed an increased survival rate and a higher number of brdu positive, dna synthesizing nuclei, compared to standard culture media. in addition a larger number of beta-tubulin iii+, immature neurons, has been detected compared to standard culture media, indicating a positive influence of embryonic avian csf on neurogenesis. as there are well known differences between avian and mammalian csf  <cit>  with a much greater complexity of mammalian csf, the transferability of these results to human conditions is not yet clear. also, they might be a difference in between effects of adult csf on nscs and embryonic csf effects. still, this is not yet investigated, even though it has been suggested that csf plays an important role not only during brain development but also for the survival, proliferation and differentiation of neuroectodermal stem cells in vivo  <cit> . in this present study we therefore used an in vitro cell system of adult human nscs in culture as a model to investigate the effects of adult human csf on nsc behaviour.

RESULTS
csf increases the survival rate of adult human nscs
after in vitro expansion for at least three passages in standard media, nscs were transferred to uncoated chamber slides and expanded in standard expansion medium or csf for additional  <dig> h. thereafter, cells were stained with hoechst  <dig> and propidiumiodid to determine the amount of necrotic cells. our results showed a significantly higher survival rate of nscs in csf compared to standard expansion medium  with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of necrotic cells in csf versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in expansion medium . addition of the bone morphogenic protein  inhibitor noggin did not significantly increase cell death rates compared to csf without noggin . similar results were obtained during in vitro differentiation with significantly higher survival rates in csf compared to standard differentiation media: after  <dig> h in p4-8f media,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of nscs were found necrotic versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in csf . after  <dig> h, the proportion was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for standard media versus csf, respectively . again, addition of noggin to csf had no significant influence on the cell death rate during differentiation for the first  <dig> h .

csf inhibits proliferation of adult human nscs
to determine the influence of adult human leptomeningeal csf on self-renewal potential of adult nscs, we used the proliferation markers ki <dig> and brdu as read-outs. for this, after in vitro expansion of at least three passages, cells were transferred to uncoated chamber slides and expanded in culture medium or csf. the self renewing potential was determined at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  after media was changed. at each time point, the percentage of ki67+ and brdu+ nscs was significantly higher in expansion medium compared to the one in csf, representing a larger number of proliferating cells in expansion media. hence, after  <dig> h ki <dig> was detected in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of nscs expanded in standard medium compared to only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of nscs expanded in csf . for brdu, we detected  <dig>  ±  <dig>  brdu+ cells/cm <dig> in ko-dmem, but only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  brdu+ cells/cm <dig> in csf .

csf increases extension outgrowth velocity from adult human nscs
we used the time course of extension outgrowth as a first measure of the differentiation process of nscs in culture. thus, following expansion for at least three passages in vitro nscs were allowed to differentiate. cells were plated onto pll-coated chamber slides in either differentiation media or csf. for investigating extension outgrowth, number and length of extensions were determined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after starting the differentiation process. comparing results in p4-8f and csf, we found significantly longer and a significantly more cell extensions per cell in csf. after  <dig> and  <dig> h the difference was significant as nsc neurites getting twice as long in csf  as in p4-8f . significant more cell extensions were determined in csf for the time points  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h with an average number of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cell extensions in csf after  <dig> h compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  neuritis in p4-8f. after  <dig> h, the mean number of cell extensions was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in csf versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in p48f and after  <dig> hours cells had at an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cell extensions in csf compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in p4-8f respectively..

csf facilitates astrogliogenesis but inhibits neurogenesis from adult human nscs
to investigate the question whether the presence of adult human leptomeningeal csf does have an influence on astrogliogenesis, oligodendrogenesis or neurogenesis, adult nscs were allowed to differentiate for  <dig> days on pll-coated chamber slides in either standard differentiation media or csf. after differentiation in standard media,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the cells were gfap+, in contrast to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gfap+ cells in csf . the values for galc+ oligodendroglial cells and map2+ neurons were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % galc+ and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  map2+ cells in standard media and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  galc+ and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  map2+ cells in csf . the low percentage of map2+ cells in standard media and csf is most likely caused by the lack of fully differentiated phenotypes, as map <dig> represents a marker for mature neurons. staining against the neuronal marker protein β-tubulin iii, a marker for immature neurons, revealed  <dig>  ±  <dig> % β-tubulin iii+ cells in csf compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  β-tubulin iii+ cells in standard media .

discussion
there is growing evidence that csf plays an important role in physiological as well as pathophysiological processes of the brain including adult neurogenesis  <cit> . in a very recent study of our group, we found adult human leptomeningeal csf being a promotor of survival, differentiation and astrogliogenesis of fetal nscs from rat  <cit> . the influence of csf on adult nscs remains however still enigmatic. in this study we therefore used human adult nscs as an in vitro model to study the effects of adult leptomeningeal csf on nsc behaviour including survival, self renewal and differentiation. the central finding of our study is that in vitro, adult csf promotes survival and differentiation of ahnscs, but drives the differentiation process towards astrogliogenesis. in accordance with these findings, the loss of stem cell potential is accelerated when cultured in adult csf. these findings suggest that adult csf contains key factors involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation processes. this assumption is supported by in vivo findings, demonstrating that adult nscs of the subventricular zone have transitory contact with the ventricular brain cavity and many of them still posses one microcilia which extends into the csf  <cit> . in addition, it is known from previous studies  <cit>  that embryonic csf has a trophic influence on survival and differentiation of nscs. however, the loss of stem cell potential is decelerated, which is contradictory to our findings in adult csf and may explain the abundance of post-mitotic cells in adult cns.

based on the knowledge of embryonic csf studies, it has already been postulated that diffusible factors in embryonic csf regulate the three basic cellular behavioural parameters of neuroephitelial stem cells and that embryonic csf may play a key role in brain development in vivo  <cit> .

however, how csf influences neuroectodermal cells during development remains enigmatic, but the components contained in csf as well as csf pressure and flow seem to play an important role  <cit> . regarding the components of csf influencing neuroectodermal cell behaviour, recent investigations concentrated mainly on proteins, "membranous particles" and amino acids but also on growth factors such as fgf <dig>  <cit> . in avian and human csf, many proteins with a known influence on cell survival, neural and glial differentiation, proliferation and signal transduction were found   <cit> . although it has also been demonstrated that the protein composition of embryonic csf is more complex than that of adult csf  <cit> , our results indicate that adult csf has the capacity to influence the behaviour of adult nscs in the adult brain, too.

csf as a beneficial environment for cell survival and growth has also been postulated by in vivo studies, investigating for example the behaviour of fetal nscs after injection in the fourth ventricle of spinal cord lesioned rats with a good survival of grafted cells within the csf  <cit> , as well as in a recent in vitro study of our own group with fetal rat nscs  <cit> . in the present study, csf had a general stimulating effect demonstrated by the faster loss of self-renewing capacity and stronger cell extension outgrowth. adult hnscs differentiated predominantly into astrocytes  when treated with csf and to a lower extend into oligodendrocytes and neurons. after differentiation for  <dig> days, we found 9% of the cells to be β-tubulin+ in csf. in standard culture media, 31% of the cells were β-tubulin iii+. therefore, our data strongly suggest inhibitory effects of csf on neurogenesis of ahnscs, but promoting effects on astroliogenesis. possible factors in csf influencing differentiation behaviour of nscs are bone morphogenetic proteins : monoclonal antibodies against bmp <dig> were for example shown to inhibit csf induced dendritic outgrowth of neurons. bmp <dig> was shown to induce neuronal differentiation of nscs by activating the erk and inhibiting the gsk3β pathway. both described effects could be blocked by noggin, a bmp inhibitor  <cit> . these described effects of bmps, do have an influence on neuronal differentiation only in fetal nscs from rat. until recently, it remained elusive whether these bmps may also play a role in the observed effects of adult human csf on astroglial differentiation, but we could show that parts of the csf mediated effects on fetal rat nscs could be blocked by noggin <cit> . bmps thus seem to be at least a part of the soluble factors in the csf influencing stem cell behaviour in fetal rat nscs. however, in the present work, we could not find any inhibiting effects of noggin on csf survival effects on adult human nscs. this raises the question whether bmps influence nsc behaviour only during ontogenesis and therefore have no influence on nscs derived from the adult brain or whether bmps might differential effects in human and rat cell systems.

it is well accepted that lumbar csf is different from ventricular csf because of both passive diffusion processes across the blood-csf-barrier and suggested active secretion processes during the cranio-caudal circulation  <cit> . consistently, all herein described csf effects can only be attributed to leptomeningeal csf. whether ventricular csf has similar same effects on nsc behaviour remains elusive. the use of csf out of ventricular drainages is however problematic, as ventricular drainages are used in patients with obstructed csf circulation  or other reasons of elevated brain pressure with defect blood-brain- and blood-csf-barrier . furthermore, csf out of ventricular drainages is often contaminated by blood and altered by inflammatory processes, which is why it cannot be used for the examination of healthy csf effects.

CONCLUSIONS
together, our results demonstrate that adult leptomeningeal csf has a trophic influence on adult human nscs: survival and differentiation into astroglial cells are promoted. thus, our data point to a pivotal role of csf in regulating adult neurogenesis under physiological and presumably also under pathological conditions as suggested previously  <cit> . future experiments are warranted to determine which compounds within the csf, besides bmps, might be responsible for the effects on npc behaviour. it also needs to be investigated whether there are different csf compounds influencing the behaviour of nscs originating from fetal or adult brain. this might give us the opportunity to influence resident nscs of the svz to induce their proliferation as well as to promote their migration to pathologically altered brain regions.
