BACKGROUND
statistical power calculations are a critical part of any study design for gene mapping. with regards to quantitative trait locus  mapping, it is typically assumed that there are two allele at the qtl, and hence three genotypes . for each genotype, there is a corresponding mean quantitative value that is determined by the biometric model developed by falconer and others  <cit> . to determine the mean of the heterozygote, we need a parameter known as the dominance parameter. software to compute power for the biallelic situation has been made available in the genetic power calculator, developed by purcell et al.  <cit>  however, for haploid organisms or loci, there is no such parameter because there are no heterozygotes. thus, there is a different set of calculations necessary to compute power for association. there has been an extensive amount of literature written on the analysis of haploid data  to our knowledge, there has been no power calculator developed for qtl mapping with haploid loci. this is an oversight, since there are several common situations in humans involving loci that are haploid or hemizygous  <cit> .

the purpose of this work is to mathematically derive the biometric model for haploid loci, and to compute power for qtl mapping when the loci are haploid.

implementation
the program for computing power is written in c++ and may be created on any computer that has a c++ compiler, for example those computers with a unix or linux operating system.

after making the executable, the user types the phrase "power-ttesthap" to implement the program. the user is queried for the sample size of the study. next, the user is asked for the significance level at which simulation power is to be computed. when this value is entered, the threshold for the t-test is computed and reported to the screen. following this, the user is asked about the locus-specific quantitative trait heritability q. when this value is entered, the program determines the means of the allele  <dig> group and the allele  <dig> group, as well as the variance in each group. finally, the user is asked to specify the number of replicates for which power is computed. we recommend at least  <dig>  replicates. see figure  <dig> for an example of how data are entered, and see additional file  <dig>  below, we place an example run.

RESULTS
calculations of simulation power as function of locus specific qtl heritability and increaser allele frequency
in table  <dig>  we provide an abbreviation of all the variables used in the results section. in figure  <dig>  we plot the simulation power as a function of the locus specific qtl heritability and the increaser allele frequency, using the ranges of q and p that we specified in the methods. there are several conclusions we may draw from studying this graph. the first is that, as q increases, the power increases for any value of p. the second conclusion is that, if q is held constant, the power differs minimally over the range of p. in fact, if we consider the set of consecutive differences  – ),  – ),...,  – ), the maximum difference is  <dig> , and the average difference is - <dig> . the maximum difference occurs for the difference  – ). we note that the power was calculated using the executable file that is compiled from the material in additional file  <dig> 

by contrast, if we consider the set of consecutive differences  – ),  – ),...,  – ), the maximum difference is  <dig>  and the average difference is  <dig> . the maximum difference occurs for  – ).

another result from this graph is that power of at least 80% may be achieved when the locus specific qtl heritability q is at least  <dig> , suggesting that genes for qtls with reasonable variance may be mapped even when the significance level is stringent.

real data example – efhc <dig> gene snp rs <dig> typed in  <dig>  x turner syndrome subjects
zinn et al. genotyped  <dig>  <dig>  x turner syndrome subjects at the snp rs <dig>  they also phenotyped the subjects for facial affect fear recognition score and performed a t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference in the scores based on the allele at the rs <dig> locus  <cit> . they found no significant difference among the two groups .

because there are  <dig> subjects with the g allele and  <dig> subjects with the a allele, we estimate the increaser allele frequency to be  <dig> . the sample size we consider is  <dig>  we specify a range of locus-specific qtl heritabilities from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in increments of  <dig> . since we are only performing a single test, we consider a significance level of  <dig> . we present our results in figure  <dig>  where each simulation data point is created using  <dig>  replicates. in that figure, we see that power increases as the heritability goes up . also, a heritability of  <dig>  gives a simulation power of approximately  <dig> . these results suggest that the heritability is lower rather than higher.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first work to determine the power of qtl mapping for haploid loci or organisms. we compute power by simulation, and our results with exact analytic power suggest that the power by simulation is highly accurate. the most common application of these results is snp association studies of loci on the x or y chromosomes in male subjects. other situations where haploidy arises in humans include chromosome disorders such as  <dig> x turner syndrome  <cit>  and segmental aneuploidies such as cri-du-chat  syndrome  <cit> . last, the power to map qtls in haplo/diploid organisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae can be increased by studying organisms in the haploid state  <cit> .

natural extensions of this work are situations such as gene-gene interactions , gene-environment interactions, and multi-trait mapping. this is the subject of future research. the purpose of this work is to provide researchers with the simplest non-trivial example of power calculations for haploid data.
