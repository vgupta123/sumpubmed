BACKGROUND
sudden cardiac death is a common and tragic complication of heart disease that affects more than  <dig>  americans annually  <cit> . the pathophysiology of myocardial remodeling, at functional and molecular levels, results in a substrate ripe for arrhythmic complications  <cit> . remodeling of connexin <dig>  gap junction distribution and expression has been described in ischemia, infarction, hibernating myocardium and dilated cardiomyopathy  <cit>  and is a potentially significant contributor to the arrhythmogenicity of cardiac disease  <cit> . indeed, we have observed that decreased expression and mislocalization of cx <dig> to the lateral borders of myocytes in the peri-infarct zone  was found to correspond spatially to the central common pathway of figure-of-eight reentrant ventricular tachycardia circuits  <cit> .

chronically altered ventricular activation, such as that induced in canine models using pacing or radiofrequency ablation of the left bundle branch, has been associated with focal structural gap junction remodeling  <cit> . areas of gap junction remodeling observed in the dog heart after  <dig> days of pacing were localized exclusively to regions in close proximity to the pacing electrode  <cit> . since less than an hour of ischemia-reperfusion in an isolated rat heart is required to demonstrate intracellular redistribution of cx <dig>  <cit> , we predicted that pacing-induced gap junction remodeling might occur over a short term.

to test our hypothesis, we adapted the subdiaphragmatic approach for programmed electrical stimulation in the mouse heart  <cit>  to allow for six hours of single lead ventricular pacing at rates just above those of sinus rhythm. we used a murine model since it might facilitate molecular studies of remodeling by eventually allowing for the use of transgenic models to elucidate mechanisms. pacing via the subdiaphragmatic approach was associated with significant mechanical dyssynchrony. after six hours of pacing, we observed a significant decrease in cx <dig> mrna levels, evidence of intracellular redistribution of cx <dig> protein, and an accumulation of ubiquitinated cx <dig> in the paced hearts. our findings were consistent with decreased production and disrupted degradation of cx <dig>  possibly accounting for preserved total cx <dig> protein levels despite decreased mrna expression and reduced membrane immuno-localization of cx <dig> after pacing.

these data suggest that alterations in the expression and distribution of cx <dig> occur after limited exposure to pacing. changes in cx <dig> expression patterns may contribute to increased arrhythmogenicity in the presence of additional insults to the heart. since gap junction alterations may be preventable or reversible, elucidating the pathways involved may ultimately allow for the pharmacologic targeting of intermediaries in those pathways and the prevention of arrhythmic complications.

methods
pacing procedure
mice aged  <dig> –  <dig> months were used for these experiments. all studies were performed in accordance with the regulations of the institutional animal care and use committee of the new york university school of medicine . the c57bl/6j strain was used for all experiments except for immunoblotting of ventricular lysates and quantification of mrna expression, for which cd- <dig> mice were used. mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane  and immobilized on a heating pad set to 37°c. electrocardiographic signals from limb leads were monitored during the experiment and recordings were obtained prior to the initiation of pacing, during pacing  and following cessation of pacing.

following recording of the baseline electrocardiogram, a  <dig> cm midline incision was made in the epigastric region. a custom-designed ue-gm <dig> cardiac stimulating electrode with a  <dig> μm monopolar platinum tip  mounted on a micromanipulator  was inserted through the diaphragm directly into contact with the surface of the beating right ventricle. electrode contact was ensured by monitoring the electrocardiographic activity. pacing was performed with a model  <dig> programmable stimulator . output was set at twice the stimulating threshold in all animals, with a pulse width of  <dig>  ms. pacing cycle lengths were set and maintained at 10–15% above the underlying heart rate, to ensure 100% capture for  <dig> hours. to serve as controls, age-, sex- and strain-matched mice were prepared and anesthetized with the pacing electrode placed into contact with the heart identically to the paced cohort, but the programmable stimulator was not switched on .

electrocardiographic recordings
electrocardiographic signals were recorded as previously described. electrocardiographic intervals were calculated from leads i, ii and iii recorded at the beginning of each study and after the completion of the pacing protocol.

echocardiography
echocardiography was performed according to a previously described protocol  <cit>  on paced and sham-paced mice , prior to and during or immediately following six hour pacing and sham protocols. mice were imaged using a philips hdi  <dig> echocardiography machine equipped with a  <dig> mhz linear probe.

in vivo electrophysiology
programmed electrical stimulation  was carried out in paced and sham-paced mice at baseline and after the pacing protocol as described previously  <cit> . the pes protocol consisted of trains of eight beats at pacing cycle lengths of  <dig> ms and  <dig> ms, followed by single extrastimuli for the determination of ventricular effective refractory period  and double extrastimuli to assess for inducible arrhythmias. pes data represent the average of two trials at separate sites on each heart.

tissue handling and immunolabeling
following the pacing procedure, hearts destined for immunostaining were rapidly excised and frozen in tissue tek oct compound . five micron-thick sections were cut in an hm  <dig> cryostat  at -20°c, placed onto superfrost/plus microscope slides  and fixed in acetone. we selected frozen sections to evaluate the left ventricle from basal, mid-ventricular, and apical regions. we defined the basal region as those sections proximal to the papillary muscles; mid-ventricular regions were those sections of lv with clearly identified papillary muscles; and apical regions were distal to the papillary muscles. we also evaluated apical and basal sections of the right ventricle.

sections were blocked and then double-stained with a custom-made rabbit polyclonal anti-cx <dig> antibody  <cit>  at 1: <dig> and wheat germ agglutinin to visualize myocyte borders as previously described  <cit> . for visualization of cadherin staining, frozen sections were incubated with a rabbit anti-pan-cadherin antibody , followed by a texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody  and a fitc-conjugated anti-cx <dig> antibody. stained sections were visualized on an axioskop  <dig> plus fluorescence microscope. images were collected using uniform exposure settings for each staining run on an axiocam camera with axiovision  <dig>  software .

quantification of cx <dig> and cadherin immunosignal
images of immuno-stained sections from paced and sham-paced hearts were obtained from blinded slides and digitally archived for offline analysis. blinded image files were uniformly thresholded by eliminating signal-free areas above and below the distribution of intensity values using the histogram function on adobe photoshop. digital image processing was then performed according to previously established techniques  <cit> , again in a blinded fashion, with nih image j to determine cx <dig> and cadherin signal area as a percentage of total tissue area, as well as cx <dig> plaque size and the number of cx <dig> plaques per 40× field.

immunoblotting and densitometry
for the evaluation of total protein levels by immunoblotting, endocardial ventricular tissue from paced and sham-paced hearts was prepared by dounce homogenization in lysis buffer supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail . endocardial samples were prepared by mounting the excised lv free wall in an oct block, separating the endocardial, mid-myocardial and epicardial regions by sectioning on an hm  <dig> cryostat and homogenizing as above. the inner third of the lv free wall was considered the endocardial region, middle third mid-myocardial and outer third epicardial. protein concentrations were determined by bradford assay performed in triplicate and equal loading was confirmed with coomassie staining. proteins were electrophoresed on 10% sds-page gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose blots . immunoblots were blocked followed by incubation with appropriate primary antibodies directed against cx <dig>  cadherin , cx <dig>  <cit> , cx <dig>  and gapdh . hrp-conjugated secondary antibody  was then applied, followed by hyglo chemiluminescent processing  and autoradiography. at least two separate experiments were quantified by scanning the autoradiograms on a bio-rad gel doc gs  <dig> and calculating band intensity using quantity one software . connexin band intensities were normalized to the relative intensity of the corresponding gapdh band for each sample. results were expressed as a percentage of matched sham-paced controls.

fraction preparation and immunoprecipitation
to determine sarcolemmal and non-sarcolemmal cx <dig> concentrations, fractionation of samples was performed as described  <cit> . briefly, heart samples were dounce homogenized, centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> minutes to remove insolubles and layered over a 45% sucrose cushion. after centrifuging at  <dig> × g for  <dig> minutes, the supernatant  was separated from the cloudy layer immediately overlying the sucrose . protein concentrations in each fraction were determined by bradford assay performed in triplicate and equal loading was confirmed with coomassie staining. the resulting fractions were analyzed by sds-page and western blotting.

for immunoprecipitation,  <dig> μg of total heart lysate was incubated with polyclonal anti-cx <dig> antibody. after addition of protein a-agarose-immobilized protein beads  to the samples, the protein a suspension was centrifuged at  <dig> × g and the supernatant was removed. the protein a beads were washed in ip buffer and resuspended in loading buffer prior to incubation at 100°c and analysis by sds-page. the resulting blots were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against ubiquitin  and processed as above.

rna isolation and quantitative real-time pcr 
to isolate total rna, the lv free walls of paced and sham-paced hearts were excised, mounted in oct and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. endocardial and epicardial thirds were collected by sectioning through the lv free wall as described above. rna was isolated using trizol  according to the manufacturer's recommendations. rna quality was verified with the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . the concentration of rna was determined by the quant-it ribogreen rna assay kit . real time quantitative pcr was performed using the abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . cx <dig> primer sequences, located in the 3' untranslated region, were as follows: forward primer sequence was 5'-gtgccggcttcactttcattaag-3'; reverse primer sequence was 5'-actgacctcgcggaacc-3'; probe sequence was 5'-tttctctccacgggtct-3'. all data were normalized to cyclophilin a  and expressed as fold change compared to the sham-paced controls. negative controls were performed for each of the samples, in which reverse transcriptase was not added prior to rna quantification. results per animal represent the mean of six measurements of each endocardial and epicardial sample.

statistics
data are expressed as mean ± sem. quantitative immunofluorescence data were compared between groups with anova using statview . data from electrocardiography, echocardiography, pes, immunoblot densitometry and qrt-pcr were compared between groups with unpaired two-tailed t-tests . electrocardiographic indices, echocardiographic measurements and erp values obtained during or after the pacing protocol were compared to baseline measurements with paired two-tailed t-tests . p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
stimulating electrode is consistently positioned on the right ventricle
for ease of pacing and reliability, we used the subdiaphragmatic approach, which allows for placement of the stimulating electrode on the heart without necessitating sternotomy, thoracotomy, mechanical ventilation or manipulation of the vasculature  <cit> . for the investigation of probe placement after the pacing protocol was completed, a midline sternotomy was performed at the end of four consecutive experiments. in all four animals examined in this fashion, the stimulating electrode traversed the diaphragm and made contact with the right ventricular  surface without puncturing the heart . local structures  were not disrupted by the electrode. thus, the pacing model employed in this study can be considered as single-lead rv epicardial pacing.

threshold is unchanged after pacing protocol
since our objective was to model altered activation rather than induce tissue damage  <cit> , we limited the stimulator output to approximately twice the stimulating threshold . the average threshold prior to pacing was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma . in a subset of eight mice, the threshold was determined after pacing. in this group the average post-pacing threshold was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma . the unchanged threshold values after pacing underscore the stability of the experimental preparation.

short-term pacing is associated with mechanical dyssynchrony
to determine whether short-term pacing influenced synchrony of cardiac contraction, we examined mice prior to and during pacing using echocardiography. the septal-to-posterior wall motion delay , an echocardiographic index of dyssynchronous contraction  <cit> , increased significantly from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms before pacing to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms during pacing . delay in onset of systolic wall thickening measured from the septal to the posterior walls also increased significantly during pacing . as expected, surface electrocardiograms demonstrated substantial widening of the qrs complex during pacing, suggesting aberrant intraventricular electrical conduction . fractional shortening was marginally decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at baseline to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % during pacing .

data is presented as group means ± sem. comparisons between groups were performed with unpaired t-tests. *, p <  <dig> . idd, ids, intraventricular dimensions at end-diastole, end-systole; awts, awtd, anterior wall thicknesses at end-systole, end-diastole; pwts, pwtd, posterior wall thicknesses at end-systole, end-diastole.

although global ventricular function was slightly diminished during pacing, fractional shortening was not significantly altered after cessation of pacing in the paced mice compared to matched sham-paced controls or compared to their baseline values. similarly, left ventricular dimensions and wall thicknesses were not significantly changed in paced mice compared to matched sham-paced controls or baseline values . thus, short-term pacing was associated with dyssynchrony during pacing and a slight decrement in ventricular function that normalized immediately after cessation of pacing.

post-pacing data  are presented as group means ± sem. comparisons between groups were performed with unpaired t-tests. idd, ids, intraventricular dimensions at end-diastole, end-systole; awts, awtd, anterior wall thicknesses at end-systole, end-diastole; pwts, pwtd, posterior wall thicknesses at end-systole, end-diastole.

short-term pacing results in focal reduction of cx <dig> immunosignal area at the endocardium of the left ventricular free wall
to characterize the effect of short-term pacing-induced dyssynchrony on gap junction distribution in the mouse heart, we paced mice for  <dig> hours   <cit>  and assessed cx <dig> localization using immunofluorescence staining. in sham-paced mice, cx <dig> immunosignal was arrayed in heterogeneously distributed membrane-associated plaques throughout the myocardium . in the sham-paced hearts, cx <dig> signal area as a percentage of total tissue area was greater in the endocardial region of the left ventricular  free wall  than in the epicardial region . after  <dig> hours of pacing, however, cx <dig> immunosignal area was reduced specifically at the endocardial region of the lv free wall  in comparison to the endocardium of sham-paced controls , without a detectable change in epicardial cx <dig> signal .

post-hoc analysis showed that the cx <dig> signal area was decreased significantly only at the basal lv endocardial segments in paced hearts compared to sham-paced hearts . there were trends at the apical  and mid-ventricular  lv endocardial segments toward decreased cx <dig> signal area in paced hearts, although these were not statistically significant.

there was no difference in cx <dig> signal area between sham  and paced  rv sections. specifically at the rv apex where the stimulating electrode was placed, there was no statistically significant difference in cx <dig> signal area between sham  and paced hearts .

trends in endocardial gap junction plaque sizes mirrored changes in cx <dig> immunosignal area, although differences in plaque size among groups were not statistically significant . there was no significant difference in the number of gap junction plaques per 40× field in sham and paced endocardial and epicardial regions . thus, the epicardial-to-endocardial gradient of increasing cx <dig> signal area observed in the lv free wall of sham-paced hearts, which has been described previously by other investigators <cit> , was eliminated after  <dig> hours of pacing due to a focal decrease in cx <dig> immunosignal area at the endocardium of the lv free wall.

relationship of cx <dig> to cardiac adherens junctions is unaffected by short-term pacing
adherens junctions, like gap junctions, are concentrated at the intercalated discs of adult cardiac myocytes. since the expression pattern of cx <dig> immunosignal was altered by short-term pacing, we investigated whether immunosignal area of cadherin, a critical component of the adherens junction with a half life of 5– <dig> hours  <cit> , was also changed. unlike the epicardial-to-endocardial gradient of increasing cx <dig> immunosignal area, there was no difference in cadherin immunosignal area between epicardial and endocardial regions in sham-paced control hearts . furthermore, cadherin signal area in both epicardial and endocardial regions remained unchanged after  <dig> hours of pacing . this suggests that the reduction in endocardial cx <dig> signal area with pacing occurs in the absence of changes in the distribution of the adherens junctions.

to determine whether short-term pacing was associated with redistribution of cx <dig> signal away from the intercalated disc, we performed colocalization analysis of cx <dig> and cadherin immunosignal . the percentage of cx <dig> immunosignal colocalizing with cadherin in the paced hearts was unchanged in comparison to sham-paced controls. this suggests that short-term pacing in the mouse heart does not affect the process whereby cx <dig> protein is directed to sites of adherens junction aggregation in the sarcolemma  <cit> .

to further assess the effect of short-term pacing on targeting of cx <dig> protein along the sarcolemma, we used a subjective scoring system in which the degree of cx <dig> immunosignal at the lateral myocyte borders in sections from paced and sham-paced hearts was compared. paced and sham heart sections were blindly assigned scores ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we found that sham sections demonstrated extensive subjective lateralization of cx <dig> signal  and that the extent of lateralization did not appear significantly different in the paced hearts .

expression of cx <dig> mrna is down-regulated in the lv free wall after  <dig> hours of pacing
since cx <dig> immunosignal area was reduced at the lv endocardium after  <dig> hours of pacing, we investigated the effects of short-term pacing on cx <dig> mrna levels in the lv free wall endocardial and epicardial regions of paced and sham-paced control hearts. as shown in figure  <dig>  qrt-pcr demonstrated a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold down-regulation in expression of cx <dig> mrna at the endocardial region of the paced hearts compared to the sham-paced group . furthermore, a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold reduction in cx <dig> mrna expression was observed at the epicardial regions of the paced hearts compared to sham-paced controls . thus, six hours of pacing at rates just above those of sinus rhythm resulted in significant reductions in cx <dig> mrna levels at the lv free wall.

cx <dig> abundance is preserved in the lv endocardial region after short-term pacing
since short-term pacing in the murine heart resulted in down-regulation of cx <dig> mrna levels in the lv and decreased immunosignal of cx <dig> at the endocardium, we investigated whether endocardial cx <dig> protein abundance was affected by pacing. surprisingly, there was no significant change in cx <dig> protein expression in the paced lv endocardial region compared to sham-paced controls . densitometry values of the slower migrating  cx <dig> bands expressed as a ratio to the lower-most band was unchanged in paced compared to sham-paced samples, suggesting that the overall phosphorylation status of cx <dig> was unaffected by short-term pacing. expression levels of cadherin, cx <dig> and cx <dig> by immunoblotting were also statistically unchanged after pacing in the lv free wall endocardial myocardium . thus, despite significant reductions in cx <dig> immunosignal area and mrna abundance in the paced hearts, overall cx <dig> protein expression levels are preserved.

altered distribution of cx <dig> in paced hearts
since total endocardial cx <dig> protein levels in the paced hearts were unchanged despite reduced mrna levels and immunosignal area, we considered that pacing might have resulted in redistribution of cx <dig> from the sarcolemma into non-sarcolemmal pools. fractionation of heart samples demonstrated significantly reduced cx <dig> abundance in the sarcolemma-enriched fraction isolated from paced hearts compared with sham-paced controls . in contrast, cx <dig> levels in the supernatant  increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . these findings suggest that the intracellular distribution of cardiac cx <dig> may be altered by short-term pacing with a reduced proportion that is localized to the sarcolemma.

with reduced cx <dig> mrna levels despite preserved total protein abundance and an apparent redistribution of cx <dig> immunosignal from the sarcolemma, we predicted that the process of degradation of gap junction moieties might be disrupted, resulting in an accumulation of ubiquitinated cx <dig> in the paced hearts. we tested this prediction by immunoprecipitating cx <dig> in lysates from five sham-paced and five paced hearts, followed by gel electrophoresis and blotting for ubiquitin. we observed a substantially increased expression of ubiquitinated forms in the paced hearts . these findings suggest that while cx <dig> immunosignal area and mrna levels are decreased, overall cx <dig> protein levels in the paced hearts are preserved, possibly due to a combination of decreased production, altered intracellular distribution and disrupted degradation of cx <dig> 

electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic parameters are unaltered after short-term pacing
we next investigated whether pacing-induced changes in cx <dig> expression were associated with persistent alterations in electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic indices. after cessation of pacing, we did not detect significant changes in electrocardiographic parameters in the paced mice when compared with baseline values or sham-paced controls . there was also no significant difference between paced and sham-paced mice in refractoriness as determined by pes after the pacing period . furthermore, pes with single and double extrastimuli did not result in sustained ventricular arrhythmias in any of the mice tested. thus, there was no effect of short-term pacing at rates just above sinus in wild type mice on electrocardiographic or electrophysiologic parameters. these data suggest that the observed pacing-induced changes in cx <dig> distribution are not sufficient, in the absence of other insults to the myocardium, to cause a demonstrable arrhythmogenic effect.

post-pacing data  are presented as group means ± sem. comparisons between groups were performed with unpaired t-tests. for electrocardiographic indices, n =  <dig> sham and  <dig> paced; for electrophysiologic data , n =  <dig> in each group. verp, ventricular effective refractory period.

discussion
in this study, we investigated the effects of short-term, single-lead ventricular pacing on cx <dig> expression and distribution. we found that pacing at the epicardial surface of the rv using the subdiaphragmatic approach was associated with dyssynchronous systolic contraction of the left ventricle. pacing for only six hours at rates within 10% – 15% of sinus rhythm resulted in significantly reduced membrane-based cx <dig> immunosignal in the endocardial regions of the lv free wall. while levels of cx <dig> mrna were significantly decreased, cx <dig> protein abundance was unchanged by pacing in lysates isolated from the endocardial third of the lv free wall. fractionation of ventricular lysates was consistent with a partial redistribution of cx <dig> protein from the sarcolemma into non-sarcolemmal pools in the paced hearts compared to sham-paced controls. immunoprecipitation of cx <dig> and blotting for ubiquitin demonstrated a substantially increased accumulation of ubiquitinated cx <dig> in the paced hearts. thus, our studies suggest that short-term pacing results in significant reductions in cx <dig> transcription and/or mrna stability, altered intracellular distribution of gap junction protein, and a disruption in the process of degradation of cx <dig> 

it is intriguing that in the absence of an underlying disease process, such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, hypertrophy or ischemia, short-term pacing of the heart at rates just above that of normal sinus rhythm should produce significantly decreased cx <dig> mrna levels and intracellular redistribution of cx <dig> protein. nevertheless, our observations are in keeping with findings from pacing studies in other animal models. patel, et al, performed a study in which dogs were paced for  <dig> days at rates 10% – 15% above the normal sinus rate  <cit> , in contrast to canine models of pacing-induced heart failure in which the ventricles are paced at more than twice the normal sinus rate  <cit> . patel and colleagues observed an apparent redistribution of cx <dig> labeling from the intercalated discs to the lateral cell membranes of myocytes close to the site of pacing. this redistribution of cx <dig> immunosignal is reminiscent of the gap junction remodeling seen in the peri-infarct zone of experimental myocardial infarction  <cit> . however, acute pacing such as that performed in the present study may be insufficient to cause gap junction remodeling of the extent seen in ischemic conditions.

in another model of the effects of chronic dyssynchrony, dogs studied four weeks after radiofrequency ablation of the left bundle branch were found to have cx <dig> lateralization that was associated with reductions in conduction velocity, action potential duration and refractory period  <cit> . lateralization of cx <dig> signal and the accompanying electrophysiologic alterations in the canine left bundle branch block model were limited to epicardial regions in the late-activated lateral wall of the left ventricle. altered stress-strain relationships during ventricular pacing have been observed previously using magnetic resonance imaging  <cit> . hence, it is conceivable that altered stress-strain relationships, owing to intraventricular and interventricular dyssynchrony, may be important factors underlying altered intracellular gap junction distribution in the left bundle branch block model, as well as in our model of epicardial right ventricular pacing.

while altered gap junction expression was observed after several weeks of pacing or experimentally induced left bundle branch block in the canine model, other data suggest that changes in gap junction expression may be induced over a much shorter time frame. ischemia induced by cessation of perfusion for up to  <dig> min in the isolated rat heart resulted in dephosphorylation and redistribution of cx <dig> from the intercalated disc, without a net loss of cx <dig> protein abundance from the myocardium. lateralized cx <dig> immunosignal in the isolated ischemic rat heart appears to be mainly phosphorylated in those hearts that recovered contractile function, but nonphosphorylated in those hearts that did not recover function during reperfusion  <cit> . based on these data, we predicted that short-term pacing in the mouse may also result in redistribution of cx <dig> signal within the ventricular myocyte.

the effect of short-term pacing on connexin expression has been previously described in the setting of strong electric currents, which were up to  <dig> times greater than those used in this study and represented a model of cardiac tissue damage  <cit> . in that study, sambelashvili et al. provided fundamental insight into cardiac stimulation by demonstrating the effect of acute tissue damage on virtual electrode polarization patterns. in addition, they observed changes in local connexin expression near the stimulating electrode under control conditions  and "damage" conditions . the extent of connexin loss was greater under damage conditions suggesting a voltage dose-response. our study differs in that we used the minimum current density  to ensure sustained capture. our intention was to model altered activation rather than acute tissue damage. interestingly, our exhaustive studies of tissue near the site of stimulation did not reveal local changes in connexin expression. however, we did observe changes that were distant and more diffuse, yet more subtle.

our results demonstrating a gradient of increasing epicardium to endocardium cx <dig> immunostaining area in the sham-paced hearts are consistent with data presented by other groups. yamada et al. observed a similar transmural gradient of cx <dig> immunosignal distribution in mice of the same strain as that used for our study  <cit> . a transmural gradient of cx <dig> expression in the canine heart has been associated with gradients in conduction velocity and action potential duration  <cit> . these data suggest that regional heterogeneities in the expression of cx <dig> may underlie important electrophysiologic properties of the heart. in this study, we have observed that short-term pacing at rates just over that of sinus rhythm eliminates the transmural gradient of cx <dig> immunosignal area. while the normally functioning heart may be able to absorb subtle alterations in the distribution of cx <dig>  such as those induced by short-term pacing, in the setting of additional insults similar changes in cx <dig> distribution may result in more deleterious electrophysiologic consequences.

previously, we and others have observed significant changes in ecg parameters and a substantially elevated risk of lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias in conditional models of decreased cardiac cx <dig> expression  <cit> . in the present study, we have observed no persistent changes in the ecg and no increased inducibility of arrhythmias after cessation of pacing despite significant intracellular redistribution of cx <dig> protein. clearly, the magnitude of altered cx <dig> localization due to short-term pacing in and of itself is insufficient to result in significant arrhythmogenicity. in the setting of reduced baseline cx <dig> expression, however, such as we and others have described in the diseased heart  <cit> , or in combination with superimposed electrophysiologic changes due to ischemia, pacing-induced gap junction remodeling may have significant arrhythmic implications. furthermore, our present findings do not rule out the possibility that more prolonged pacing might promote additional changes in cx <dig> expression and distribution that would have potentially pro-arrhythmic effects.

the cx <dig> gap junction is known to be degraded along the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, with involvement of the endosome/lysosome either sequentially or in parallel  <cit> . ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of cx <dig> is a highly regulated process, in which epidermal growth factor  may play a prominent role  <cit> . however, while egf-induced ubiquitination of cx <dig> is associated with hyperphosphorylation of the gap junction protein, we did not detect a change in the phosphorylation status of cx <dig> in the paced endocardial myocardium. this suggests that the ubiquitinated forms of cx <dig> may accumulate in the paced hearts in a process independent of egf.

we intend to use the pacing model to broaden our understanding of the role of cx <dig> and its regulation in cardiac disease. however, an important potential limitation of this model is that the mechanisms underlying pacing-induced changes in gap junction expression are not necessarily the same as those responsible for gap junction remodeling observed in ischemia, the peri-infarct zone or other pathological states. nonetheless, defining the mechanisms responsible for pacing-induced alterations in the intracellular distribution of cx <dig> will allow us to generate hypotheses that will be testable in models of cardiac disease.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report that short-term cardiac pacing at rates just fast enough to ensure capture, induces mechanical dyssynchrony of the left ventricle, significantly decreased cx <dig> mrna levels and partial redistribution of cx <dig> protein in the murine heart. these data suggest that limited exposure to dyssynchronous activation results in remodeling of the cardiac gap junctions in the absence of sustained measurable effects on contractility or arrhythmic inducibility. however, in the setting of cardiac disease with decreased baseline cx <dig> expression, dyssynchronous activation with its attendant effects on gap junction remodeling may further exacerbate arrhythmic complications and worsen cardiac performance.
