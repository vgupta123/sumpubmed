BACKGROUND
the p <dig> tumor suppressor coordinates the response of cells to genotoxic insults and other forms of cell stress either by inducing cell cycle arrest and allowing time for dna repair or by causing elimination of damaged cells through apoptosis. the central role of p <dig> in cell stress responses lends significance to recent reports that p <dig> exists as a family of at least  <dig> different isoforms with different n- and c-termini due to differential splicing and promoter usage  <cit> . three human n-terminal p <dig> isoforms are known containing either the full-length transactivation domain , or a truncated transactivation domain  or no transactivation domain altogether . the functional importance of some of these isoforms in vertebrate cells and organisms has only recently come into focus. specifically, transgenic overexpression of Δnp <dig> in mice leads to premature aging associated with increased expression of the cdk inhibitor cdkn1/waf1/p <dig> and reduced proliferation  <cit> . in addition, both alternative n-terminal p <dig> isoforms have been observed to be differentially expressed in human tumor cell lines  <cit> . finally, the zebrafish ortholog of the human Δ133p <dig> isoform  is induced by genotoxic stress, counteracts flp <dig> function and protects zebrafish embryos against deleterious consequences of genotoxic stress  <cit> . whereas Δnp <dig> expression is induced in an mdm2-dependent fashion in human colon carcinoma cells  <cit> , expression and functional attributes of Δnp <dig> in stress responses at the level of the whole organism have yet to be reported.

the present study seeks to investigate functional attributes of Δnp <dig> in developing zebrafish embryos. we cloned the zebrafish Δnp <dig> ortholog and, like Δ113/133p <dig>  found it to be induced at the mrna level by ionizing radiation . ectopic expression of zebrafish Δnp <dig> isoform modulated the functional consequences of flp <dig> expression in concert with Δ133p <dig> in zebrafish embryos. furthermore, human Δnp <dig> phenocopied the effects of zebrafish Δnp <dig> when overexpressed in zebrafish embryos.

RESULTS
identification and expression of zebrafish Δnp53
to amplify zebrafish Δnp <dig> transcripts we designed a primer pair  that targets 5' sequences in intron  <dig> unique to a putative Δnp <dig> and 3' sequences contained in exon  <dig> which are shared between all known p <dig> isoforms . an rt-pcr product of the expected size  was identified in rna preparations from  <dig> hpf embryos exposed to ir  at  <dig> hpf. sequence determination of this amplification product revealed p <dig> sequences including intron  <dig> sequences . the predicted protein encoded by this transcript lacks part of the canonical transactivation domain but, unlike human Δnp <dig>  contains additional amino acids encoded by intron  <dig> which also contributes an alternative translation start site . by semiquantitative rt-pcr, we confirmed that radiation exposure led to moderately increased steady-state Δnp <dig> transcript levels in zebrafish embryos concomitant with increased Δ113p <dig> mrna levels . these findings were consistent with prior work describing cell stress-induced expression of Δ113p <dig> mrna in zebrafish  <cit> . increased expression of Δnp <dig> in human cell lines has similarly been observed in conditions of cell stress although this phenomenon has primarily been attributed to changes in protein abundance, rather than steady-state mrna levels  <cit> . although it is currently unknown how cell stress alters mrna processing and splicing patterns, stress-associated alternative splicing has been observed for several mrna species including the transcripts encoding mdm <dig> and mdm <dig>  <cit> . as expected, flp <dig> transcript levels were comparable in irradiated and control embryos. next, we verified that the putative alternative translation start codon m <dig> located in intron  <dig> of Δnp <dig> was functional by microinjecting mrna containing p <dig> exons 1- <dig> and intron  <dig> including m <dig> cloned upstream of and in-frame with the firefly luciferase gene. expression of this construct in embryos resulted in high-level luciferase activity, which was not observed when the m <dig> methionine was changed to glycine . these results, in addition to the fact that exons  <dig> and  <dig> contain no in-frame translation initiation codons suggest that the m <dig> codon in intron  <dig> is the relevant alternative translation codon leading to Δnp <dig> expression.

effects of forced Δnp <dig> expression on zebrafish development
we next determined the effects of ectopic Δnp <dig> expression on zebrafish development using both human and zebrafish Δnp <dig> orthologs. injection of embryos with Δnp <dig> mrna of either species  was calibrated to the endogenous Δnp <dig> mrna levels observed in  <dig> hpf embryos after ir . forced expression of either Δnp <dig> ortholog induced lethality in approximately 30% of the embryos within 5- <dig> days  associated with marked changes in morphology in the surviving embryos . specifically, Δnp <dig> overexpression induced hypoplastic and malformed heads, eyes and somites . in addition, we observed moderately increased levels of apoptosis in Δnp53-injected embryos as determined by acridine orange  staining . by comparison, ectopic expression of flp <dig> alone  led to embryonic lethality affecting the majority  of early-stage  embryos  preceded by multiple morphological aberrations . concurrent ectopic expression of mrnas encoding Δnp <dig>  and flp <dig> was associated with significant albeit not complete rescue of flp53-associated lethality . consistent with a recent report  <cit> , the Δ113p <dig> isoform  efficiently rescued lethal effects of forced flp <dig> overexpression . as expected, injection of functionally impaired mutant p <dig>  isoforms  <cit>  did not visibly affect zebrafish embryo viability or appearance . in aggregate, these results suggest that the relative abundance of the two isoforms in p <dig> tetramers is likely to affect the functional outcome of forced Δnp <dig> expression.

combined effects of ectopic Δnp <dig> and Δ113p <dig> isoform expression on flp53-induced embryonal lethality
previous work assessed the effects of transgenic overexpression of either Δnp <dig> in mice  <cit>  or Δ113p <dig> expression in zebrafish  <cit> . however, it is not known how simultaneous expression of the two alternative n-terminal p <dig> variants affects p <dig> responses of the whole organism. this is a relevant question because we observed coincident induction of Δnp <dig> and Δ113p <dig> expression upon ir exposure of zebrafish embryos . to address this question directly we examined the consequences of ectopic expression of both alternative isoforms together with flp <dig>  to this end, we injected triple mrna combinations encoding the different isoforms at different ratios ranging between  <dig>  -  <dig> ng/embryo . these experiments confirmed that Δ113p <dig> was more efficient than Δnp <dig> in rescuing flp53-induced lethality. they further revealed that a combination of both alternative n-terminal isoforms does not add to the extent of rescue achievable with Δnp <dig> alone . it is possible that morphological aberrations induced by ectopic Δnp <dig> expression alone restrain the extent of rescue achievable by Δ113p <dig> expression. in contrast to Δnp <dig> and as described previously  <cit> , ectopic Δ113p <dig> expression, even at very high levels  had no apparent effect on zebrafish morphology or development . finally, ectopic expression of Δ113p <dig>  did not affect the incidence of Δnp53-dependent hypoplasia although the two isoforms could be coimmunoprecipitated . at present, it is unclear why forced expression of Δ113p <dig> clearly counteracts the effects of flp <dig> on zebrafish survival but not those of Δnp <dig>  it seems possible that the two alternative n-terminal isoforms in combination affect transcription of a subset of target genes that are deleterious to the developing embryo.

the Δnp <dig> isoform regulates p <dig> target gene expression in concert with flp53
transgenic expression of Δnp <dig> is associated with high-level expression of the cdk inhibitor cdkn1/p21/waf <dig> expression in mice  <cit> . similarly, and as determined by qrt-pcr we observed an increase in p <dig> message levels in zebrafish embryos injected with Δnp <dig> mrna  and this effect was even more pronounced in irradiated embryos . interestingly, co-injection of a morpholino  ablating flp <dig> expression  <cit>  prevented Δnp53-dependent p <dig> mrna induction indicating that Δnp <dig> overexpression by itself is insufficient to upregulate p <dig> expression. to ascertain whether Δnp53-dependent p <dig> expression was functionally involved in morphological alterations caused by Δnp <dig> overexpression we ablated either p <dig> or flp <dig> expression by coinjection of the respective mos with Δnp <dig> mrna. targeting p <dig> expression using a previously validated morpholino  <cit>  markedly rescued hypoplasia of the eyes and somites caused by ectopic Δnp <dig> expression  and marginally reduced overall apoptosis . consistent with the requirement of flp <dig> for Δnp53-dependent p <dig> induction, targeting flp <dig> expression similarly alleviated hypoplasia in Δnp <dig> overexpressing embryos and caused an even more robust reduction in apoptosis . we next determined whether Δ113p <dig> expression caused by ir in zebrafish embryos was similarly affected by ectopic Δnp <dig> expression. we observed that forced Δnp <dig> expression increased steady-state Δ113p <dig> transcripts and that, as in the case of p <dig>  this effect was also contingent on the presence of flp <dig> . collectively, these results underscore that functional consequences of flp <dig> overexpression are modified by coincident induction of either or both n-terminal p <dig> isoforms. in all experiments we used the p53α c-terminal isoforms, which form dimers and tetramers with each other  <cit>  as confirmed for the zebrafish orthologs Δ113p <dig>  <cit>  and Δnp <dig> . to determine the functional importance of dimer/tetramer formation for these effects we used a Δnp <dig> construct in which the c-terminal residues  that are homologous to the human oligomerization domain were deleted  <cit> . as expected, forced expression of c-terminally truncated Δnp <dig>  induced neither embryonal lethality nor the hypoplastic phenotype associated with forced expression of intact Δnp <dig> α . furthermore, c-terminally truncated Δnp <dig> also did not affect p <dig> expression in irradiated embryos . in contrast and as expected, ablating endogenous Δnp <dig> expression by a Δnp53-specific mo in irradiated embryos moderately reduced p <dig> and Δ113p <dig> mrna levels induced by ir albeit not to the extent achieved by flp53-specific mo . the mo used in this experiment targets untranslated sequences contained in intron <dig> upstream of the putative m <dig> transcription start site as indicated in fig.  <dig>  this mo is functional because it markedly  reduced expression in zebrafish embryos of a reporter construct consisting of luciferase cloned downstream of the 5' utr of Δnp <dig> containing exons  <dig>   <dig> and intron  <dig> including the putative start site m <dig> . despite its effects on steady-state p <dig> and Δ113p <dig> transcripts, the Δnp53-specific mo did not measurably affect overall survival of zebrafish embryos irradiated at  <dig> hpf. effects of Δnp <dig> knockdown on the radiation response of specific organ sites are currently under investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that ir exposure of zebrafish embryos increased steady-state transcript levels of the two known alternative n-terminal p <dig> isoforms, Δ113p <dig> and Δnp <dig>  these isoforms shared the ability to counteract lethal effects of flp <dig> expression in the developing fish. however, in contrast to Δ113p <dig>  forced expression of Δnp <dig> induced morphological aberrations itself, notably hypoplasia of the head and somites associated with a moderate degree of lethality. these effects of Δnp <dig> were contingent on the presence of flp <dig> and due, in part, to p <dig> induction. furthermore, the developmental aberrations caused by forced expression of Δnp <dig> limited the extent of rescue of flp53-induced lethality by this isoform either alone or in combination with Δ113p <dig>  future work will address the relevance of Δnp <dig> to the genotoxic stress response of specific tissues as induction of p <dig> targets occurs in a tissue-specific manner in mice  <cit>  and Δnp <dig> is expressed differentially in normal human tissues and malignancies  <cit> .
