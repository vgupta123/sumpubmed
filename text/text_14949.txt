BACKGROUND
viruses as obligate intracellular parasites rely upon the host cell for different steps in their life cycle, including attachment, disassembly, transcription, translation, reassembly, and egress. consequently, characterization of these cellular processes will be essential for any understanding of viral life cycles, and may provide cellular targets for new antiviral therapies.

the susceptibility to virus infection varies greatly among different cell types, and virus-resistant cells frequently emerge post-infection  <cit> . this suggests that host cell contributions to the virus life cycle, although complex, have genetic determinants. we therefore used a genetic approach to identify cellular genes required for infection by reovirus, a small cytolytic rna virus that replicates in the cytoplasm. a gene trap retrovirus was use to create libraries of rat intestinal epithelial  cell clones in which each clone contained a single gene disrupted by an integrated retrovirus. the mutant libraries were then infected with reovirus, and resistant clones were selected. we hypothesized that genes mutated by gene entrapment may confer reovirus resistance as a result of either haploinsufficiency or loss of heterozygosity and could be identified by characterizing the genes disrupted by the entrapment vector. from these experiments we have isolated  <dig> clones and have characterized mutations in  <dig> different genes, providing potential candidates required for reovirus infection and/or cell killing. many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. for example, four mutations affected genes in the insulin growth factor- <dig>  pathway, including genes encoding the igf-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor  <cit>  , the igf binding protein  <dig> protease  <cit>  , and ctcf , a transcriptional repressor of the igf-ii gene  involved in paternal imprinting.

the frequency of mutations involving the igf-ii pathway led us to investigate the role of igf-ii in reovirus infection. clone 6b <dig>  which contains a mutation in ctcf  <cit> , was found to over express igf <dig> transcripts, consistent with the known role of ctcf as a transcriptional repressor of the igf <dig> gene. moreover, forced expression of igf-ii in rie- <dig> cells was sufficient to confer cellular resistance to lytic reovirus infection. enforced igf-ii expression also transformed rie- <dig> cells to anchorage independent growth, a phenotype associated with malignant change. these results represent the first use of gene entrapment to identify components of host cell metabolism required for virus infection and illustrate a potential mechanism of carcinogenesis associated with chronic virus infection.

RESULTS
disruption of the ctcf gene results in cells resistant to lytic infection by reovirus
gene entrapment strategies to identify host genes required virus replication depend on methods to select for virus resistant clones present at about one in 104â€“ <dig> mutagenized cells. unfortunately, cells persistently infected with reovirus  can emerge at high frequencies  and are intrinsically resistant to the virus  <cit> . in preliminary studies, we found that hepa 1/a cells were not suitable for genetic studies due to the emergence of pi clones. however, persistently infected rat intestinal epithelial cells   <cit>  were found to require a serum survival factor and die when placed in serum free media . in vitro infection of rie- <dig> cells with reovirus also appears to mirror virus replication in the rodent host  <cit> . consequently, rie- <dig> cells were used in the present study, and reovirus-resistant clones were selected in serum-free medium to remove pi survivors. rie- <dig> cells were mutagenized by using the u3neosv <dig> gene trap shuttle vector  <cit>   and the resulting libraries of mutagenized cells were infected with reovirus serotype 1/lang at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. the isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, and did not produce infectious virus as assessed by plaque assay, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not pi.

regions of genomic dna adjacent to the u3neosv <dig> provirus in each virus resistant clone were isolated by plasmid rescue and sequenced. altogether, of the  <dig> isolated clones, 62% of flanking sequences matched known or presumptive genes, and an additional 23% were represented in the public databases of expressed sequence tags  or non-redundant sequences . from the  <dig> clones matching known or presumptive genes,  <dig> genes were represented more than once. many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. for example, the library included  <dig> independent mutations involving three genes that encoded proteins associated with the insulin growth factor- <dig>  signalling pathway, namely, igf-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor  <cit>  , the igf binding protein  <dig> protease  <cit>  , and ctcf , a transcriptional repressor of igf-ii involved in paternal imprinting  <cit> . the position of the provirus  in the first intron of the ctcf gene is shown in figure  <dig>  ctcf differentially represses maternal igf <dig> gene expression, whereas the imprinted paternal gene escapes repression due to methylation of ctcf binding sites  <cit> .

igf <dig> transcripts induced by ctcf disruption
considering that four clones had mutations in the igf-ii pathway, the relationship between the ctcf mutation in 6b <dig> cells and the virus resistant phenotype was investigated further. levels of ctcf protein in 6b <dig> cells were reduced by about 50% as assessed by western blot analysis , consistent with the disruption of one allele. diminished ctcf expression was associated with an increase in igf <dig> transcripts as assessed by northern blot hybridization . in addition, two products were amplified from 6b <dig> cells by rt-pcr using primers flanking the igf-ii pro-hormone coding sequence . the first product was identical to the rat igf-ii pro-hormone  coding sequence , whereas, the second contained  <dig> additional nucleotides generated by splicing of exon  <dig> to an alternative splice acceptor located  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the normal igf <dig> exon  <dig> splice acceptor site. the alternative transcript is expected to encode a pro-igf-ii protein extending  <dig> amino acids into the e-peptide sequence ending in a stretch of  <dig> amino acids lacking homology with any known protein .

resistance to reovirus lytic infection results from increased igf <dig> expression
the stability of virus resistance in the 6b <dig> cell was tested by infecting rie- <dig> and 6b <dig> cells with reovirus type  <dig> at a moi of  <dig>  there was approximately a  <dig> fold lower titre of reovirus obtained following infection of 6b <dig> cells as compared to rie- <dig> cells at  <dig> hrs. post-infection , and the difference was also maintained at  <dig> hours post-infection . additionally, there was a dramatic difference in the survival of 6b <dig> cells after being exposed to high titres of reovirus type  <dig> .

to determine whether igf <dig> confers resistance to reovirus infections, clones of rie- <dig> cells over-expressing the full-length igf <dig> transcript or the splice variant  were generated and examined for their capacity to resist lytic infection. as shown in figure  <dig> expression of wild type , but not the splice variant  increased the resistance of rie- <dig> cells to reovirus infection by over  <dig> fold. however, when the igf2svwas transfected into 6b <dig> cells, the ability of 6b <dig> cells to survive infection was abolished. expression of the igf <dig> gene in an anti-sense orientation caused no significant difference in the capacity of 6b <dig> cells to resist infection . these studies suggest that increased igf <dig> expression in 6b <dig> cells is associated with their capacity to resist reovirus infection, and that the igf2svencodes a trans-dominant isoform that blocks the activity of igf <dig> 

the igf-ii hormone confers resistance to lytic infection
igf <dig> transcripts encode a pro-hormone of  <dig> amino acids that is processed to generate the 67-residue igf-ii protein  <cit> . other proteolytic products including the 89-residue carboxy-terminal e peptide may also be biologically active  <cit> . the igf2sv pcr product also contained a single nucleotide substitution  that results in the substitution of a threonine for alanine at position  <dig> of igf-ii, raising questions about igf <dig> sequences that influence reovirus resistance. vectors expressing only the 68-residue igf-ii protein both with and without the a62t change were compared for their ability to confer resistance to lytic infection by reovirus type  <dig> . the igf-ii expression vector converted rie- <dig> cells to a virus resistant phenotype; whereas, the igf-ii62t expression plasmid was inactive  and did not suppress the resistance of 6b <dig> cells . these results indicate that virus resistance can be affected by mutations in the igf-ii coding sequence and downstream sequences, including the e-peptide, are not required. however, the trans-dominant effects of igf2sv apparently require alterations to the carboxy-terminus of the igf-ii pro-hormone.

over expression of igf <dig> confers resistance to other reovirus sertotypes
rie- <dig> cells are intrinsically resistant to infection by reovirus type  <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, experiments to assess the effects of igf-ii expression on lytic infection by reovirus type  <dig>  were performed using murine l-cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  l-cells expressing igf <dig> were significantly more resistant to both reovirus serotypes than the parental cells, indicating that the ability of igf-ii to confer resistance to reovirus infection is not limited to a single cell or virus type.

igf-ii expressing rie- <dig> cell has delayed disassembly of virus particle
previous studies have indicated that proteoytic disassembly of virus particles occurs in the lysosome and requires the participation of cathepsin b and l that are transported by the igf2r gene  <cit> . igf <dig> binds to igf2r resulting in alteration in cathepsin trafficking  <cit> . georgi and colleagues showed that directly fluorescentated reovirus particles dissipated their fluorescent signal coincident with disassembly of the outer capsid  <cit> . to determine whether over expression of igf <dig> would affect disassembly of virions, we examined the fate of virus during the first hours of infection. purified reovirus type  <dig> virions were directly labeled with fluorescein and adsorbed to rie- <dig> or 6b <dig> cells, and the persistence of a fluorescein signal determined at  <dig> hrs following virus absorption . the binding of virions to rie- <dig> cells and 6b <dig> cells and initial accumulation of virus particles within cells was similar, however fluorescence was almost non-detectable in rie- <dig> cells  whereas it was still present in 6b <dig> cells at  <dig> hrs . in addition, western blot analysis of virion proteins  <dig> hrs following attachment to cells confirmed the persistence of the Ïƒ <dig> protein in the 6b <dig> cell clone, but not rie- <dig> cells . therefore, disassembly of virions is altered in the 6b <dig> cell clone.

ctcf deficient rie cells grow in soft agar, a consequence of increased igf <dig> expression
accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced igf-ii expression associated with loss of igf <dig> genomic imprinting may promote tumour formation  <cit> . although rie- <dig> and 6b <dig> cells appeared to proliferate at similar rates as assessed by mts/pms incorporation , 6b <dig> cells that have a disrupted ctcf gene were capable of forming colonies in soft agar . to assess the role of igf-ii in anchorage-independence, cells transfected with igf <dig> and igf2sv were tested for their ability to grow in soft agar. rie- <dig> cells transfected with igf <dig>  but not igf2sv formed colonies in soft agar , whereas 6b <dig> cells transfected with igf2sv lost their capacity to proliferate in soft agar as did cells transfected with an anti-sense igf <dig> construct . the igf-ii62t expression plasmid had no transforming activity . on balance, transforming activities of the different igf <dig> plasmids on rie- <dig> and 6b <dig> cells as assessed by the soft agar assay were similar to their effects on reovirus resistance, although the vector expressing only igf-ii was less active in transforming rie- <dig> cells to anchorage independence than vectors expressing the entire pro-hormone.

the capacity to proliferate in soft agar was not a property of other reovirus resistant cell clones that contained mutations in the igf-ii pathway. figure  <dig> shows that cell clones with disrupted igfr or prss <dig> genes did not form colonies in soft agar . an additional reovirus resistant-clone with an insert in the anxa <dig>  gene, associated with cytomegalovirus infection  <cit>  and recognized to bind to the insulin and insulin growth factor receptor- <dig>  <cit> , also failed to grow in soft agar . therefore, the capacity to proliferate in soft agar was not a general property of reovirus-resistant cells, even in clones that contain mutations in the igf-ii pathway. however, l-cells also displayed enhanced ability to grow in soft agar in addition to virus resistance, following enforced igf <dig> expression .

discussion
insertional mutagenesis provides an approach to identify genes associated with selectable cellular phenotypes. we have isolated over  <dig> potential clones with mutations in genes that may play roles in the life cycle of reovirus. in the present study, one clone resistant to reovirus lytic infection contained a provirus inserted into the gene encoding the ctcf transcriptional regulator. ctcf binding motifs are present in many genes, including igf <dig>  <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , and myc  <cit> . however, since  <dig> other clones selected for reovirus resistance contained mutations in the igf-ii pathway, the role of igf-ii in virus-resistance was investigated further. reduced expression of the ctcf gene was associated with enhanced igf <dig> expression in virus-resistant cells, while forced expression of the igf <dig> gene in the parental rie- <dig> line was sufficient to confer resistance to lytic reovirus infection.

by inference, the recovery of inserts affecting other genes in the igf-ii signalling pathway suggests that mutations in multiple genes may affect the same phenotype by acting on a common pathway. the insert in igf2r was found to decrease the expression of the gene as assayed by northern blot analysis . as igf-ii targets the igf2r to lysosomal degradation, mutations in the genes encoding either the receptor  or its ligand  will affect the activity of the other, and result in a reduced endosomal trafficking of hydrolases necessary for reovirus disassembly  <cit> . our data indicates there is a decrease in virus disassembly in 6b <dig> cells, consistent with a block at this step in morphogenesis. further studies will be required to assess if and how inserts in the prss <dig> and igf2r genes influence reovirus resistance.

as the entry, disassembly, transcription, translation, and repacking of viruses share common features; we anticipate that common cellular pathways will influence infection by other virus families. indeed, igf2r has been implicated in herpes simplex and zoster virus infection  <cit> . however, the present study is the first to show a direct connection between igf <dig> gene expression and resistance to lytic virus infection. by using constructs that encode the mature hormone without the e-peptide, we were able to show that forced igf-ii expression is sufficient to confer a reovirus resistant phenotype. these results differ from other studies in which reovirus replication was enhanced by treatment of rie- <dig> cells with insulin. the latter effect is presumably caused by enhanced virus replication associated with cell proliferation  <cit> .

expression of the igf <dig> gene is frequently elevated in common childhood and adult neoplasms  <cit>  and has been associated with tumour progression and metastasis  <cit> . igf <dig> also transformed rie- <dig> cells to anchorage-independence, a phenotype that predicts the potential for malignant growth in vivo. virus-resistant 6b <dig> cells also grew in soft agar, presumably as a result of enhanced igf-ii expression. since plasmids expressing only igf-ii were less active in transforming rie- <dig> cells to anchorage independence than vectors expressing the entire pro-hormone, further study is needed to determine whether the capacity of rie- <dig> cells to proliferate in soft agar is enhanced by the e-peptide or other products derived from the carboxy terminus of the pro-hormone. in other studies, the e-peptide enhanced insulin secretion from Î²-cells  <cit> , and may play a role in cellular transformation  <cit> .

cdna clones of an alternatively spliced igf <dig> transcript , blocked the ability of igf-ii to promote reovirus resistance and anchorage independent growth in a trans-dominant manner. the protein coding sequence of igf2svcontains a frame shift in the e-peptide region and lacks a site  <cit>  required for the proteolytic processing of the pro-hormone. the alternative splice site is used very infrequently  and thus probably plays no physiological role. further studies are planned to determine molecular basis for the dominant negative activity of igf2sv.

6b <dig> cells were highly resistant to reovirus infection as determined by virus yield and cell survival at different times post-infection. virus resistance was a genetically selected trait manifested by clonally pure cell populations, could be conferred by enforced igf-ii expression, and involved decreases in virus disassembly. although decreased virus disassembly is sufficient to explain virus resistance, we do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms may contribute to the resistance of 6b <dig> cells, since any genetic selection may generate clones with multiple, independent mutations. the fact that an early step in infection  is defective in 6b <dig> cells makes it very difficult to test whether downstream steps might also be affected.

while the original impetus of our studies was to understand the replication cycle of intracellular pathogens that cause acute and chronic infectious diseases, the finding of cell growth phenotypes associated with virus resistance is of some interest. it has been proposed that lytic viruses may used to treat certain malignancies  <cit> . however, based upon our observations, such therapy may carry a risk associated with selection of virus resistant cell clones with enhanced growth/survival potential. additionally, chronic infections contribute to the development of a number of human cancers  <cit> . while the carcinogenic process is not well understood, cell proliferation associated with inflammation is also thought to contribute to tumour promotion  <cit> . the present study illustrates how carcinogenesis could also be influenced by selection for virus-resistant cells with mutations in genes affecting cell proliferation or survival.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first reported use of gene entrapment to identify host genes affecting the susceptibility of cells to virus infection. these results indicate that igf-ii, and by inference other components of the igf-ii signaling pathway, can confer high levels of resistance to lytic reovirus infection. igf-ii expression specifically blocked virus disassembly. ctcf disruption and forced igf <dig> expression both enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar, a phenotype associated with malignant growth in vivo. therefore, these results illustrate a potential indirect mechanism of viral carcinogenesis by which cells selected to virus resistance may also have enhanced oncogenic potential.
