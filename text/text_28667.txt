BACKGROUND
androgens play a pivotal role for the development of the male phenotype, the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility . the action of the most important androgens testosterone  and dihydrotestosterone  is mediated by the androgen receptor . it is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. the ar/ar gene is located on the x chromosome and consists of eight exons, coding for the n-terminal transcription regulation domain, the dna binding domain  in the middle of the protein and the c-terminal ligand binding domain . the dbd as well as the lbd are highly conserved throughout species . bound to its ligand, the androgen-ar complex is translocated into the nucleus, binds to the dna  and is able to activate or repress gene expression by recruiting co-activators or co-repressors . the activity of steroid hormone receptors is also regulated by post-transcriptional modifications. in case of ar/ar, a great variety of these modifications has been described, i.e. phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and also methylation .

the ar/ar is expressed in all tissues except the spleen . in the testis, it is expressed in interstitial leydig cells and endothelial cells, as well as in peritubular myoid cells and tubular sertoli cells  <cit> , for review see  <cit> . since germ cells do not express ar/ar, the androgen action has to be mediated towards the germ cells by sertoli cells. these somatic cells have been described as branched cells surrounding all germ cell stages  <cit> . as was shown by willems et al.  <cit> , a selective ablation of ar in mouse sertoli cells  leads to a disturbed sertoli cell maturation including a delayed and defective establishment of the blood-testis barrier. moreover, no meiotic germ cells were observed in scarko mice, showing the importance of a functional ar/ar on sertoli cell biology and for the development of germ cells.

to examine the role of the ar/ar in different biological processes such as cell growth and survival as well as ar/ar-dependent gene expression, cell culture systems are needed. therefore, administration of t and/or the more efficient metabolite dht has widely been used to investigate the effect of androgens and ar/ar, respectively, in diverse cultured cells such as human breast cancer cells, adrenocortical carcinoma cells, murine skeletal muscle cells or liver carcinoma cells . additionally, ar/ar-deficient cell lines were used, e.g. ar-deficient mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells, to examine the effect on estrogen administration in a system lacking ar  <cit> . szelei et al.  <cit>  transfected ar-deficient mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells with human ar and showed an inhibition of proliferation. also prostate cancer cells devoid of ar were transfected with human ar and showed a decreased proliferation rate  <cit> . the question is, whether the transfection procedure itself might have led to an altered expression of ar/ar-dependent and ar/ar-independent genes. xiao et al.  <cit>  demonstrated equal concerns in amh-cre-transfected mouse, where an increase of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in sertoli cells was detected even without stimulation.

beside “classical” androgen-dependent prostate cancer development, also androgen-independent signalling pathways gained increasing interest as shown recently by li et al.  <cit> . the authors describe a persistent transcriptional activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines in the absence of androgens. this transcriptional activity was mediated by a truncated ar protein lacking the lbd. this raises the question, whether an androgen-independent ar/ar action is always important in cell biology and which genes might be expressed or repressed by ar/ar presence alone.

for this purpose, we transfected rat sertoli cells which have been shown to be deficient of ar with full length human ar dna. after transfection, we performed genome-wide microarray analysis and compared the gene expression pattern with non-transfected sertoli cells to identify a possible “intrinsic” activity of ar/ar without androgen administration. we found significantly altered gene expression in transfected compared with non-transfected cells, possibly influencing sertoli cell function.

RESULTS
transfection of 93rs <dig> cells with the human ar
performing rt-pcr with primers specific for mouse and rat ar, respectively, rat sertoli cells  proved to lack endogenous ar  and were therefore chosen for further experiments.fig.  <dig> expression of androgen receptor  mrna in sertoli cell cultures. to find an appropriate cell culture system for our planned transfection studies, rt-pcr with specific primers for mouse and rat ar was performed. testis homogenate from rat and mouse served as positive control, whereas water was used as no template control  samples. we tested two mouse  as well as two rat sertoli cell lines . the latter revealed no expression of intrinsic ar and were therefore used for further experiments



success of transfection with full length human ar cds was validated by immunofluorescence , western blot  and rt-pcr . as the commercially available human ar was introduced in a gfp-coupled vector system, we used a rabbit anti-gfp antibody for if experiments in transfected cells whereas non-transfected cells were used as internal negative control. using page, we were able to show the cag repeat length of  <dig> to be stable throughout different settings .fig.  <dig> transfection control of 93rs <dig> sertoli cells. a 24 h after transfection, transfected  and non-transfected  cells as negative control were fixed for if experiments. left incubation with rabbit anti-gfp antibody showed successful transfection of almost 80 % of cells. right no staining signal was detectable in non-transfected cells. scale bars in main image: 200 µm, detail: 25 µm. dapi counterstain. b western blot analysis revealed ar protein in transfected sertoli cells at approx. 135 kda  and in human testis tissue at the expected molecular weight of 110 kda . the higher protein weight measured in transfected cells is due to coupling of ar with gfp. c expression of human ar mrna was tested in human testis homogenate , transfected  and non-transfected cells . ar mrna was detected in the positive control and transfected 93rs2har <dig> cells, but not in non-transfected cells and the ntc . d to control the cag repeat length in transfected 93rs <dig> cells, we performed high-resolution page. three different passages of 93rshar <dig> cells  were analysed and revealed a band for human ar at 185 bp by using two different dna ladders. by sequencing, 185 bp was shown to be typical for the presence of  <dig> cag repeats. lane  <dig> no template control

“development”, “hormone response” and “immune response” are the predominant functions of the differently regulated genes
of  <dig> annotated down-regulated genes,  <dig> could be assigned to david functional categories, and  <dig> out of  <dig> annotated up-regulated genes, respectively.

an overview of the functional categories that have been inferred with david is given in table  <dig>  down-regulation is predominant in “cell development/cell contact”, “response to hormone stimulus” and “nucleotide catabolic process”, whereas regulation is evenly distributed in “immune response”. the highest score values are achieved by four significantly overrepresented gene ontology  categories clustered under “biological adhesion”, whereas the highest number of genes is assigned to  <dig> go categories grouped as a cluster named “epithelium development”. more than half of the functional assigned groups belong to cell development and cell contact while 25 % of the functionally assigned genes are related to immune response.  <dig> genes can be attributed to “hormone stimulus” and a minority of  <dig> genes contributes to “nucleotide catabolic process”.table  <dig> overview of functional gene ontology categories according to their pattern of significantly regulated genes

upstream regulation analysis identified more activation than de-activation
upstream regulation analysis with ipa is based on gene expression patterns and predicts activation or deactivation of regulators of the differentially regulated genes. the results show that more upstream regulators are predicted to be activated  than inhibited .

these predictions are based on  <dig> genes from which  <dig> contributed to activation as well as to deactivation. the proportion of overall down- and up-regulation is mirrored in these genes with more down-regulation in inhibition as well as in activation . the majority of deactivated upstream regulators  are classified as transcription regulators. activation is mainly predicted for cytokines .table  <dig> upstream regulator analysis with ipa: types of predicted upstream regulators

summarizing the regulator according to their type revealed a high proportion of possibly activated cytokines, whereas transcription regulators play a major role in inhibition

based on gene expression patterns, predictions are made on activation or inactivation of known upstream regulators. absolute activation z-scores of higher than  <dig>  are considered to be highly significant. we found more than twice as much regulators predicted to be activated as compared to inhibited. these tables show the predicted upstream regulators with an absolute z-score above  <dig>  in detail—some are in fact complexes or groups. the prediction is opposed to the real measurement on the micro array , as far as the respective genes have passed qc and is otherwise marked as “not measured”. mean expression per group is given as logarithm of the intensity to base  <dig>  reasonably high expression values are in bold face. the column “regulation ar17” denotes if the respective gene is contained in the set of regulated genes  or at least close to significance  which holds true for the minority of genes. activation or inhibition is not necessarily reflected by significant change of gene expression, since processes not measurable on a micro array, like for example phosphorylation, are more likely to be responsible for that

the gene expression patterns upon which the prediction is made is constituted by both up-regulated and down-regulated genes. the predicted activation and inhibition is either based on two third down regulated  and one third upregulated genes .  <dig> downregulated genes and  <dig> upregulated genes contribute likewise to activation and inhibition

validation of microarray data by rt-qpcr
for validation of microarray results we performed rt-qpcr for  <dig> candidate genes, showing different ranges of regulation . among the chosen genes, some are mainly associated with development and are known sertoli cell markers, such as dhh  <cit> , gja <dig>  <cit> , inhbb  <cit> , and tf  <cit> . other genes are markers for differentiation and proliferation  and some are involved in apoptosis, such as myc and tnfrsf1a  <cit> . results from rt-qpcr were mostly consistent with data from microarray analysis . relative gene expression was lower in transfected compared to non-transfected sertoli cells in  <dig> of  <dig> cases. gene expression of cdkn1a, egr <dig>  fst, gja <dig>  myc, pmepa <dig>  ptsg <dig>  rarg and tnfrsf1a was higher in 93rshar <dig> cells compared to ar-deficient 93rs <dig> cells. in the latter case, it has to be mentioned, that differences of the means did not reach significance in four genes, due to high variability of cq.fig.  <dig> quantitative rt-pcr was performed to validate microarray analysis results. gene expression analysis for  <dig> genes that showed deviant gene expression in microarray analysis has been performed using 2−ΔΔcq method. rt-qpcr has been performed using three technical replicates in a double determination. gene expression in non-transfected 93rs <dig> cells was used as calibrator and therefore set as “1”. data are presented as mean ± sem.  and differences in mean values have been assessed with spss software; *p ≤  <dig> , n.d. not detectable



discussion
to study the effects of androgens and ar/ar on diverse cell culture systems and the relevance for cell biology, cell culture experiments were conducted in different human cell lines . also ar-deficient cell lines have been used, either transfected with ar  <cit>  or without  <cit> . both groups working with transfected cell lines performed their experiments using either not stimulated  <cit>  or mock-transfected cells  <cit>  as negative controls. moreover, jacobsen et al.  <cit>  showed, that transfection of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells lead to severe differences in gene expression levels in distinct genes, depending on the transfection reagent used. interestingly, transfection with a vector encoding for a reporter gene and a vector without insert, respectively, revealed no differences in gene expression. this implies, that the transfection procedure itself might alter gene expression in these cells. therefore, we performed gene expression analysis with ar-transfected rat sertoli cells using non-transfected cells as controls to show “intrinsic” gene expression alterations due to the transfection procedure. as electroporation has been shown to be superior with respect to cell viability and also transfection efficiency compared to chemical transfection using lipofectamine  <cit> , we applied this technique to introduce the ar. cell viability was not influenced by electroporation, but whole genome microarray analysis showed an altered gene expression. surprisingly, more genes have been down-regulated than up-regulated comparing transfected and non-transfected cells. we selected  <dig> genes showing an altered expression pattern and confirmed microarray results with rt-qpcr analysis. in the following, we will discuss in more depth interesting genes and pathways, respectively.

among the down-regulated genes, many are involved in metabolic processes, as for example in iron transport and metabolism , fc = −107; transferrin , fc = − <dig> ; six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate  <dig> , fc = − <dig> ). iron is relevant for sertoli cells in two different aspects: as supervisors of germ cell development, sertoli cells provide iron which is needed for dna synthesis and cell growth of germ cells that undergo multiple mitotic divisions  <cit> . on the other hand, sertoli cells avoid toxic environmental conditions that might be given at elevated concentrations of insoluble ferric iron . therefore, sertoli cells secrete transferrin, the product of the tf gene  <cit> , which may be used as a marker for sertoli cell function and differentiation  <cit>  as it creates an environment low in free iron that impedes bacterial survival in a process called iron withholding. the protein level of tf decreases in inflammation. the lower expression of tf gene, which was confirmed in rt-qpcr , could be interpreted as a sign of severe disturbance and inflammation of cells.

the latter is reflected by the high proportion of upstream regulators related to immune response  that are predicted to be activated  and the presence of multiple immune response-related genes on top of the list in up-regulation . “immune response” is the second huge cluster of altered genes in our study, represented by e.g. prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase  <dig>  also known as cyclooxygenase  <dig> . an increase in cox <dig> expression was observed by matzkin et al.  <cit>  in leydig cells of infertile men showing either hypospermatogenesis, sertoli cell only syndrome or maturational arrest. by increased numbers of testicular macrophages, levels of interleukin 1β  are increased and activates ptgs <dig>  the key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis culminating in inflammation. the expression of tf, ptgs <dig> and interleukins is coupled in sertoli cells; as shown by yamaguchi et al.  <cit> , incubation with cisplatin lead to an increase in ptgs <dig> and a decrease in tf expression in sertoli cell cultures, similar to our study. additionally, an analysis of upstream regulation using ipa revealed a high number of key players in inflammation to be activated showing congruently high fcs for ccl <dig>  irf <dig>  and ifnb <dig>  this might on the one side be due to the transfection procedure itself and/or reflect inflammatory processes in the cells due to increased cell damage. remarkably, an influence of molecular biological techniques on gene expression and immune response has been observed also in regard to short-interfering rnas . sledz et al. reported an induction of interferon β levels in a human glioblastoma cell line which was transfected with sirnas as a non-specific side effect additionally to the silencing of the target gene lamin  <cit>  .

not only metabolism and immune response gene expression seem to be altered in transfected sertoli cells, but also cell cycle and development genes  fc = − <dig> ; fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  fc = − <dig> ; follistatin  fc =  <dig> ; inhibin beta b  fc = − <dig> ). dhh is involved in various areas of embryonic development, including testicular cord formation. it is expressed in mouse sertoli cell precursors during mid- to late gestation  <cit>  and also is important for germ cell development after puberty in mouse  <cit>  and rat testis  <cit> . in the mouse, a lack of dhh results in a severe impairment of spermatogenesis due to a lack of spermatogonial development beyond primary spermatocytes  <cit> . fgfr <dig> is a known differentiation factor in prenatal sertoli cells as it is concomitantly expressed with sry and is essential for subsequent expression of anti-muellerian hormone  and sox <dig>  <cit> . ipa analysis of upstream regulation predicted an inhibition of transcription factor sox <dig> with a z-score of − <dig>  . moreover, lack of fgfr <dig> might cause a partial xy sex reversal, as loss of fgfr <dig> leads to an up-regulation of follistatin , a female somatic cell marker  <cit> , which was confirmed by microarray and rt-qpcr. a down-regulation of the sertoli cell marker inhbb  also points to a decreased sertoli cell function and a severe disturbance of spermatogenesis in the rat  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the association of inhbb, fst, dhh, pmepa <dig>  fgfr <dig>  ptgs <dig>  tf and myc as especially interesting genes on known pathways as predicted by ipa. fig.  <dig> illustration of eight genes and their association to known pathways in ipa. green color denotes down-regulation, whereas red color denotes up-regulation



a disturbance of sertoli cell function is also visible in gene expression alteration concerning the functional cluster “cell adherence” or “cell adhesion”  fc = − <dig> ; gap junction protein  <dig>  fc = − <dig> ). cell adhesion and formation of tight junctions between sertoli cells generating the blood-testis barrier is one of the most important features of sertoli cell maturation and function  as it is a prerequisite for intact spermatogenesis. also cell-to-cell contact and communication seem to be disturbed in transfected cells as indicated by the down-regulation of gja <dig>  also known as connexin  <dig> .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated genes involved in cell adhesion. clustering was done using “pearson correlation” and “complete linkage”. the tree on the left reflects the distances between gene profiles based on this algorithm. aj actin/intermediate = adherents junctions based on actin or intermediate filaments, tj = tight junctions. low significance:  <dig>  < fc <  <dig>  and/or fdr  <dig> – <dig>  high significance: fc >  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig> 



CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate a severe disturbance of sertoli cell metabolism, function and cell biology concerning immune status and generation of blood-testis barrier, caused by the transfection procedure even without androgen stimulation of cells. the alterations in gene expression levels might either be related to the transfection procedure itself and/or to the insertion of human ar into ar-free rat sertoli cells. a microarray analysis with mock-transfected sertoli cell line would be needed to distinguish both possibilities. we consider the altered gene expression to be caused by ar insertion, as many of the altered genes were identified as ar and sertoli cell specific. in either case, incubation of transfected cell lines with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone might lead to false-positive or false-negative results and additionally, also non-genomic pathways including ar/ar action may be altered by transfection procedures. therefore, suitable negative controls are needed for stimulation experiments with t or dht, i.e. non-transfected cells as appropriate negative controls. gene expression has to be normalized by these non-transfected cells to avoid false-positive or false-negative results regarding gene regulation.
