BACKGROUND
endometrial adenocarcinoma, originating from the glandular epithelial cells of the uterine endometrial lining, is one of the most prevalent cancers amongst women in the western world  <cit> . it is a disease which particularly occurs in post menopausal women and recent evidence suggests that mutations in oncogene expression may play a role in the etiology of the disease  <cit> . data generated in our laboratory and others have ascertained a role for the cyclooxygenase -prostaglandin  axis in the regulation of endometrial adenocarcinomas by increasing cell proliferation and the secretion of angiogenic growth factors  <cit> . this is similar to other cancers where over-expression of cox enzymes and biosynthesis of prostaglandins has been shown to promote cellular proliferation  <cit> , inhibit apoptosis  <cit>  and enhance angiogenesis  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms mediating the role of prostaglandins in regulating vascular function and angiogenesis are still poorly defined.

angiogenesis is the process of endothelial cell sprouting from an existing vasculature towards cancer cells  <cit>  and is required by any tumour larger than  <dig> mm in diameter  <cit> . the proposed mechanism of angiogenesis suggests that tumour cells secrete stimulatory factors which act in a paracrine manner on surrounding blood vessels, immune cells and fibroblasts to promote the proliferation, differentiation and migration of endothelial cells towards the stimulus  <cit> . these tumour stimulatory factors include vascular endothelial growth factor  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig> . in human endometrial adenocarcinomas vegf-a and fgf <dig> expression and secretion are elevated  <cit>  and both vegf-a and fgf <dig> can stimulate angiogenesis in xenografts in vivo  <cit> .

in a previous study we demonstrated elevated expression of the fp receptor, fgf <dig> and the fgf <dig> receptor  <dig>  in neoplastic endometrial epithelial and vascular cells and ascertained a role for the fgf <dig>  produced by pgf2α-fp receptor signalling, on epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . in this study we have shown that conditioned medium from pgf2α treated ishikawa cells stably expressing the fp receptor , can increase endothelial cell differentiation  and proliferation. treatment of ishikawa fps cells with pgf2α increases fgf <dig> secretion which in turn activates fgfr <dig> signalling in endothelial cells and induces the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase , cox- <dig> expression and secretion of pgf2α. following its release from endothelial cells, we show for the first time that, pgf2α promotes endothelial cell network formation in an autocrine/paracrine manner, via the endothelial fp receptor. by contrast, pgf2α is not involved in endothelial cell proliferation which we show to be regulated by fgf2-fgfr <dig> signalling via the mammalian target of rapamycin  pathway. taken together, our data highlight two molecular pathways by which pgf2α-fp receptor signalling can regulate endothelial cell function in endometrial adenocarcinomas.

RESULTS
pgf2α-fp signalling mediates endothelial cell network formation and proliferation via fgf2-fgfr <dig> signalling
we previously demonstrated elevated expression of the fp receptor, fgf <dig> and fgfr <dig> in endometrial adenocarcinoma  <cit> . using a neoplastic epithelial cell line stably expressing the fp receptor to the levels observed in endometrial adenocarcinoma , we ascertained a role for fgf <dig>  produced by pgf2α-fp receptor signalling, on epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . in addition, we found that fp receptor, fgf <dig> and fgfr <dig> co-localised within the vascular endothelial cells in endometrial adenocarcinomas suggesting that pgf2α may directly and indirectly regulate endothelial cell function  <cit> . to determine if the effects of pgf2α-fp receptor interaction in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells on endothelial cell function were mediated by fgf <dig>  we used conditioned medium  from ishikawa fps cells treated with vehicle or  <dig> nm pgf2α for  <dig> hours. the presence of fgf <dig> in cm from vehicle  and pgf2α-treated  ishikawa fps cells was confirmed by elisa. immunoneutralisation of p cm with fgf <dig> antibody significantly reduced fgf <dig> concentration in p cm  <cit> .

to assess the effects of the cm on differentiation  and proliferation, assays were performed using huvecs as a model system. treatment of huvecs with p cm significantly increased endothelial cell network formation  and proliferation  compared to v cm-treated cells. treatment of huvecs with p cm in the presence of the fgf <dig> receptor  <dig>  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  or fgf2-immunoneutralised cm , significantly reduced endothelial cell network formation  and cellular proliferation , confirming that these alterations in endothelial cell function were mediated by fgf <dig> in the p cm signalling through endothelial fgfr <dig> 

next we investigated the signal transduction pathways mediating the role of fgf <dig> in the p cm on network formation and proliferation. huvecs were treated with p cm in the presence of cell signalling inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase , mammalian target of rapamycin  or phosphoinositide-3-kinase . we found that the p cm-induced network formation was significantly inhibited by pd <dig> but not rapamycin, wortmannin or ly <dig> . however, endothelial cell proliferation was inhibited by pd <dig> and rapamycin but not wortmannin or ly <dig> .

we confirmed that endothelial cell proliferation but not network formation was mediated by fgf2-mtor signalling using recombinant fgf <dig> protein. treatment of huvecs with recombinant fgf <dig> significantly increased network formation  and proliferation . co-treatment of cells with recombinant fgf <dig> protein and rapamycin had no effect on network formation, compared to recombinant fgf <dig> peptide alone . in contrast, rapamycin treatment significantly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation induced by the recombinant fgf <dig> protein  confirming that endothelial cell proliferation was mediated by p cm via the fgf-fgfr1-mediated induction of the mtor pathway.

erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation is regulated by fgf2- fgfr <dig> signalling
as erk1/ <dig> was involved in regulating both p cm induced endothelial cell network formation and proliferation, we investigated the effect of p cm on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation. huvecs were treated with v cm or p cm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mins . treatment of huvecs with p cm significantly increased erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner which was maximal after  <dig> mins of stimulation, compared to v cm . co-incubation of huvecs with p cm in the presence of fgfr <dig> tyrosine kinase inhibitor , c-src inhibitor  or erk1/ <dig> inhibitor  significantly reduced the p cm-stimulated phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> to basal levels . however treatment of huvecs with p cm in the presence of the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> did not significantly reduce the p cm phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> . similarly, co-incubation of huvecs with p cm and the mtor inhibitor, rapamycin, had no effect on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation . treatment of huvecs with recombinant fgf <dig> protein phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> to the levels observed with p cm .

conditioned medium from ishikawa fps cell treated with pgf2α induces endothelial cox-2
fgf <dig> has been shown to mediate angiogenesis via cox- <dig> in an in vivo model using rat sponge implants  <cit> , hence we investigated the effect of p cm on the expression of cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> in endothelial cells. huvecs were treated with v cm or p cm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs. we did not observe an alteration in the expression of cox- <dig>  at any of the time points investigated in response to p cm stimulation. however, we observed a significant increase in endothelial cox- <dig> expression at  <dig> hours following treatment with p cm . this increase in cox- <dig> expression was inhibited by treatment with p cm in the presence of the fgfr <dig> inhibitor, su <dig> or erk1/ <dig> inhibitor, pd <dig>  indicating that cox- <dig> expression was regulated via the fgf-2-fgfr1-erk1/ <dig> signalling pathway.

cyclooxygenase enzymes are responsible for the catalysis of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins . we next investigated the secretion of endothelial pge <dig> and pgf2α in response to cm treatment. huvecs were treated with v cm or p cm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs and the secretion of pge <dig>  and pgf2α  was measured by elisa. there was no significant difference in the levels of endothelial pge <dig> secreted by huvecs in response to cm at any time point tested . in contrast, the amount of endothelial pgf2α was elevated in huvecs at  <dig> hrs following p cm treatment compared to both v cm treatment  and p cm at time  <dig> hrs . to confirm the involvement of cox in the secretion of pgf2α, we treated huvecs for  <dig> hrs with p cm in the presence of the specific cox- <dig> inhibitor ns <dig> or the general cox inhibitor indomethacin. we found that the p cm-induced secretion of pgf2α was significantly reduced by co-treatment of cells with ns <dig> . similarly, co-treatment of cells with indomethacin significantly reduced p cm-induced pgf2α secretion below the levels observed with p cm alone and p cm with ns <dig> .

the role of endothelial prostaglandin f2α-fp signalling in the regulation of endothelial cell network formation
since the secretion of pgf2α was elevated in huvecs following p cm treatment, we investigated the role of the f-prostaglandin receptor  in endothelial cell function. we found a significant elevation in endothelial fp receptor expression after  <dig> hrs of treatment with p cm . to determine if the regulation of fp receptor was mediated by fgf <dig> in the p cm, we co-incubated huvecs with p cm in the absence/presence of inhibitors of fgfr <dig> tyrosine kinase activity  or erk1/ <dig> . incubation of huvecs with p cm and su <dig> or pd <dig> significantly decreased the levels of fp receptor  indicating that fp receptor expression was regulated by fgf2-fgfr <dig> interaction via the erk1/ <dig> pathway.

next, as pgf2α secretion and fp receptor expression was increased after p cm treatment, we explored the direct effect of pgf2α, acting via the fp receptor, on endothelial cell network formation and proliferation. we found that addition of  <dig> μm exogenous pgf2α significantly increased endothelial cell network formation . in contrast, incubation of huvecs with  <dig> μm pgf2α had no effect on endothelial cell proliferation . to investigate the autocrine/paracrine effect of pgf2α-fp receptor interaction in p cm-induced endothelial network formation, we used a short hairpin rna  adenoviral construct targeted against the fp receptor  to knockdown fp receptor expression in huvecs. huvecs were infected with scrambled adenovirus  or sh <dig> for  <dig> hrs. efficiency of the fp shrna in ablating receptor expression was confirmed in the laboratory by quantitative rt-pcr and western blot analysis . infection of huvecs with sh <dig>  significantly reduced p cm-induced network formation compared to scrambled control virus . in contrast, infection of huvecs with fp receptor shrna adenovirus did not alter p cm-induced endothelial proliferation compared to huvecs infected with the control scrambled adenovirus . similar data were obtained using a second shrna targeted to a different region of the fp receptor . to confirm the role of cox- <dig> and fp receptor in endothelial cell network formation, huvecs were treated with p cm in the absence or presence of the cox- <dig> inhibitor  or fp receptor antagonist  . addition of ns <dig> or al <dig> significantly inhibited p cm-induced endothelial cell network formation .

discussion
fgf <dig> is one of  <dig> fibroblast growth factor family members and signals via one of four receptors, fgfr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of which fgfr <dig> is most commonly expressed on endothelial cells  <cit> . a principal role of secreted fgf <dig> is to stimulate blood vessel growth although we have shown previously that it can also act as a potent autocrine growth factor to enhance epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . in vitro and animal xenograft studies have shown that secretion of epithelial fgf <dig> in endometrial adenocarcinoma xenografts can enhance tumour growth by enhancing blood vessel size and width  <cit> . furthermore antisense targeting of fgf <dig> in such model systems is known to reduce tissue microvascular density as well as xenograft size  <cit> .

endothelial cell differentiation and proliferation are two of the processes required for angiogenesis  <cit> . in the present study we have shown that conditioned medium from endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, which stably express the fp receptor to the levels observed in endometrial adenocarcinomas  and produce fgf <dig>  promotes endothelial network formation  and proliferation. using a specific fgfr <dig> tyrosine kinase inhibitor and fgf2-immunoneutralised conditioned medium, we showed that the effects of conditioned medium on endothelial cell network formation and proliferation were via fgf2-fgfr <dig> signalling. we found that although the fgf2-immunoneutralised treatment inhibited network formation and proliferation, it was less effective than the fgfr <dig> inhibitor su <dig>  we believe this difference lies in the residual fgf <dig> remaining in the fgf2-immunoneutralised cm after neutralisation  <cit>  which could, albeit to a lesser extent, activate the fgf receptor on huvecs.

to explore the signalling pathways activated in huvecs by fgf <dig>  following its release from epithelial cells in response to pgf2α-fp receptor activation, we used small molecule chemical inhibitors of intracellular signalling pathways. we found that conditioned medium from pgf2α-treated ishikawa fps cells enhanced endothelial cell network formation via fgfr <dig> and erk1/ <dig> independently of pi3k and mtor. this is in agreement with the observations of kanda et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated in murine brain endothelial cells that fgf <dig> induced endothelial network formation is not dependent on activation of the mtor pathway  <cit>  and sulpice et al  <cit>  who showed that, in adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation induced by recombinant fgf <dig> is not mediated via the pi3k pathway  <cit> . similarly, peng et al. showed that fgf <dig> treatment can induce mtor phosphorylation in huvecs  <cit> .

in contrast, we found that conditioned medium-induced endothelial cell proliferation was dependent on erk1/ <dig> signalling to mtor as endothelial cell proliferation could be inhibited with the erk1/ <dig> kinase inhibitor pd <dig> and rapamycin, but not the pi3k inhibitors wortmannin or ly <dig>  this is in agreement with previous studies showing that the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor pd <dig> can inhibit fgf2- induced angiogenesis  <cit>  and huvec proliferation  <cit> . our data indicate that endothelial network formation and proliferation are regulated by distinct signal transduction pathways which are integrated by erk1/ <dig> signalling.

erk1/ <dig> is known to be a potent regulator of cell growth, differentiation and development  <cit> . once phosphorylated, erk1/ <dig> can translocate to the nucleus and promote gene transcription  <cit> . the phosphorylation and activation of erk1/ <dig> can be modulated via a multitude of intracellular signal transduction pathways. hence, we investigated conditioned medium signalling to erk1/ <dig> in huvecs and found within our experimental paradigm that erk1/ <dig> was phosphorylated in a time dependent manner. the fact that erk1/ <dig> is activated by p cm and that the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor abolished erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, as well as endothelial network formation and proliferation, suggests that erk1/ <dig> could act as a major transcriptional regulator in this model system. this phosphorylation and activation of erk1/ <dig> was found to be regulated via fgfr <dig> signalling to c-src, since co-treatment of huvecs with p cm and the fgfr <dig> inhibitor su <dig> or csrc inhibitor pp <dig> significantly inhibited erk phosphorylation. furthermore erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was found to be independent of pi3k and mtor as neither the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> nor the mtor inhibitor rapamycin  inhibited p cm-induced erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation. c-src is a protein tyrosine kinase which co-ordinates a diverse spectrum of receptor-induced signalling to erk1/ <dig> via the phosphorylation of signalling intermediates such as ras and raf  <cit> . c-src has been shown to be involved in fgf- <dig> induced angiogenesis  <cit>  and a recent study has shown that c-src, raf and erk1/ <dig> are essential for huvec lumen formation in vitro  <cit> . these data suggest that the fgf2-fgfr1-c-src pathway plays a role in the activation of erk1/ <dig> by p cm treatment.

following erk1/ <dig> activation, mtor has been shown to be regulated via the tuberous sclerosis complex  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . phosphorylation of tsc <dig> by erk1/ <dig> results in its dissociation from tsc <dig> and its subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin pathway. this inactivates the inhibitory effect of tsc1/ <dig> on the mtor pathway and allows cellular proliferation to proceed  <cit> .

over the past decade several reports have highlighted the importance of cox enzymes and prostaglandins in regulating vascular function indirectly. this may occur via the activation of erk1/ <dig> signalling resulting in epithelial or stromal cell production of pro-angiogenic factors which act in a paracrine manner on endothelial cells  <cit> . this is in agreement with our observations here whereby fgf <dig>  released by ishikawa fps cells in response to pgf2α, enhanced the expression of cox- <dig> in endothelial cells via the fgf2-fgfr1-erk1/ <dig> pathway. similarly, fgf <dig> has been shown to upregulate endothelial cox- <dig> in murine cerebral microvascular cells leading to an increase in prostaglandin e <dig> production  <cit> .

prostaglandins have been shown to be secreted by endothelial cells and to influence directly endothelial cell function via their receptors on endothelial cells  <cit> . these studies showed that pge <dig> present in the endothelial environment can enhance endothelial cell functions  <cit> , however in our study we found no significant elevation in pge <dig> biosynthesis in response to p cm. instead, we found that endothelial cells secrete elevated levels of pgf2α following activation by cm from pgf2α-treated ishikawa fps cells and that this pgf2α secretion was regulated via the fgf2-fgfr1-erk1/2-mediated induction of cox- <dig> since the specific cox- <dig> inhibitor significantly reduced pgf2α secretion. in order to determine whether cox- <dig> contributed towards the generation of pgf2α, a general cox inhibitor indomethacin was used. co-treatment of cells with indomethacin significantly reduced pgf2α secretion to a level below that observed for the specific cox- <dig> inhibitor suggesting that basal levels of cox- <dig> may, to a lesser extent, contribute towards the secretion of pgf2α. these data indicate that although pge <dig> is secreted in higher quantities than pgf2α by unstimulated huvecs  <cit> , under p cm stimulated conditions, prostaglandin f2α is the predominant cox- <dig> product. furthermore, this suggests that the endothelial signalling pathways induced by fgf <dig> are context dependent, i.e. dependent on the nature of the external stimulus, such as cancer conditioned medium, from which the fgf <dig> originates. we found exogenous prostaglandin f2α was able to stimulate endothelial cell network formation but not proliferation. interestingly, the effect of exogenous pgf2α on network formation was less than that observed for p cm. we believe that the higher levels of fp receptor in endothelial cells induced by p cm accounts for this difference. it is likely that the upregulated fp receptor in p cm treated huvecs would enable a greater signalling capacity and ability to form networks compared with huvecs treated with exogenous pgf2α alone in the absence of growth factors, where fp receptor expression is not induced. using a specific fp receptor short hairpin rna  in an adenoviral delivery system for targeted ablation of endothelial fp receptor, we found that p cm-induced endothelial network formation was regulated by the endothelial fp receptor. in addition, the use of a chemical inhibitor against cox- <dig> and a specific fp receptor antagonist further confirmed a role for endothelial pgf2α signalling through the endothelial fp receptor in the regulation of p cm-induced endothelial cell network formation.

CONCLUSIONS
as summarised in fig.  <dig>  our data show that pgf2α-fp receptor signalling in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells produces fgf <dig>  which acts in a paracrine manner on endothelial fgfr <dig> to promote endothelial cell differentiation and proliferation via distinct intracellular mechanisms. we demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby fgf <dig> induces the secretion of prostaglandin f2α to regulate p cm-induced endothelial cell differentiation. this the first study to show, with fp shrna, that endothelial fp receptors can mediate endothelial cell differentiation but not proliferation. we believe that these findings have relevance for endometrial pathologies, such as endometrial adenocarcinoma, which have aberrant expression of fp receptor and we propose a molecular mechanism whereby fp receptor may regulate vascular function  <cit> . furthermore our data suggest that targeted antagonism of epithelial fp receptor signalling, to reduce the production of growth factors, or endothelial fp receptor signalling, to prevent differentiation of endothelial cells, could provide an anti-angiogenic approach to reducing tumour vasculature and growth.
