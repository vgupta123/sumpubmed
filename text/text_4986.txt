BACKGROUND
the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that has become increasingly resistant to a wide range of antibiotics over the last two decades. the emergence of multidrug-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus  exhibiting also decreased susceptibilities to glycopeptides  represents a crucial challenge for antimicrobial therapy, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and hospital infection control. after initial description in japan of mrsa strains with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides  <cit> , clinical isolates showing similar phenotypes were repeatedly reported in various countries  <cit> . these strains are distinct from high-level glycopeptide resistant isolates  that result from the acquisition of the vana gene from enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . their potential spreading appears of particular concern since glycopeptides represent the last barrier drugs effective against mrsa. in addition, intensive use of glycopeptides will probably contribute to the selection of other resistant strains, as already observed for numerous antimicrobial agents  <cit> .

vancomycin is a natural product, isolated from the bacteria amycolatopsis orientalis in the early fifties  <cit> . binding of this molecule to the n-acyl d-ala-d-ala residue of bacterial peptidoglycan through five strong hydrogen bonds inhibits cross-linking of the cell-wall  <cit> . vancomycin acts therefore immediately upstream of the transpeptidase, the target of β-lactam antibiotics. structure and mechanism of action of teicoplanin are similar to that of vancomycin  <cit> . little is known about the underlying mechanisms which produce gisa strains. a major common marker of gisa strains is the increased cell-wall thickness  <cit> : the prototype gisa strain shows 30– <dig> cross-linked peptidoglycan layers, whereas fully susceptible strains contain only  <dig> layers  <cit> .

approximately 20% of free d-ala-d-ala residues from the peptidoglycan structure remain unprocessed by penicillin-binding proteins  in vancomycin-susceptible strains. it was therefore suggested that important quantities of glycopeptides are trapped by these free residues  <cit> . in addition, it was shown that the cross-linking rate is slower in laboratory-derived gisa compared to susceptible strains  <cit> , which may increase the number of trapped vancomycin molecules and contribute to the destruction of the mesh-structure of the cell-wall  <cit> . this cooperative clogging phenomenon has been recently shown to prevent vancomycin from reaching its target in the cytoplasmic membrane of strain mu <dig>  the first clinical isolate reported as gisa  <cit> . however, analysis of the digested cell-wall compounds with high-performance liquid chromatography  showed different peptidoglycan structures among various clinical isolates of gisa strains showing various cross-linking frequency  <cit> . in other backgrounds, originating from in vitro selection of laboratory strains, structural changes in cell-wall composition were limited  <cit>  suggesting that there is no single genetic or biochemical change responsible for the decreased glycopeptide sensitivity. several genes were indeed described to play a role in glycopeptide resistance. penicillin-binding protein  <dig>  is hypothesized to cleave the terminal d-alanine residue from un-cross-linked peptidoglycan chains  <cit> . a decrease in pbp <dig> activity, as observed in clinical isolates of gisa strains, should therefore result in a higher number of d-ala-d-ala targets for vancomycin  <cit> . pbp <dig> over-expression seems also correlated with decreased glycopeptide susceptibility  <cit> . the loss of function of the accessory gene regulator  also increases resistance to glycopeptide  <cit> . a recent report demonstrated the contribution of tcaa in the resistance mechanism. this gene encodes for a transmembrane protein showing an intracellular metal-binding motif and a large extracellular domain of unknown function. while inactivation of this gene induces increased tolerance to glycopeptides, its presence induces overproduction of the same protein, suggesting that this protein acts as a sensor and/or as a signal transducer  <cit> . however, the impact of such an observation on clinical isolates is still debated  <cit> . the two-component system vrars  <cit>  has been shown to be involved in glycopeptide resistance. the expression of vrars probably mediates positive regulation of cell-wall synthesis pathway in s. aureus, through induction of pbp <dig>  <cit> , thus increasing the sensitivity of gisa strains to cell-wall synthesis inhibitors  <cit> . in another study performed with clinical isolates and mu <dig> or mu <dig> derivative strains showing increased levels of resistance after passages onto vancomycin-containing medium, most of the genes involved in purine biosynthesis and transport were found up-regulated in the highly vancomycin-resistant strain as compared to the parental strain  <cit> . the deduced hypothesis relies on an increase in amp pool able to generate atp and compensate the difference in energy requirement observed between susceptible and resistant isolates.

altogether, glycopeptide-resistance in staphylococcus aureus appears due to multiple factors, including cell-wall synthesis and processing  <cit> , autolysis  <cit> , or regulatory events  <cit> . a major limitation of this type of comparative study is the difficulty to obtain isogenic strains showing various susceptibility phenotypes within the same genetic background and relevance in the context of human infections. our group reported the isolation of gisa subpopulations emerging from a glycopeptide-susceptible parental strain in an experimental model of subcutaneous infection  <cit> . in the same model of infection, we then isolated a spontaneous revertant strain showing restored susceptibility to glycopeptides  <cit> . to improve our understanding of mechanisms contributing to this spontaneous evolution, these three isogenic strains presenting different glycopeptide susceptibility levels were compared at the transcriptome and proteome levels during the stationary phase of growth. transcriptional profiles were performed using a customized and extensively validated oligoarray  <cit> . in addition, mass spectrometry -based protein quantification was performed on membrane-enriched extracts. enriched membrane extracts were chosen for proteomic experiments, since membrane proteins are often involved in bacterial antibiotic resistance and contribute also to numerous important metabolic pathways and transports, not only of nutrients but also of chemicals  <cit> . the recently introduced isobaric tagging technology was used for simultaneous quantification in all strains  <cit> . isoelectric focusing  on immobilized ph gradients served as the first dimensional peptide separation  <cit> , followed by lc-ms/ms analysis with a maldi tandem ms instrument. these combined approaches performed on isogenic clinical isolates showing stable resistance, without antibiotic pressure revealed genes and proteins identified as potentially involved in the acquisition of glycopeptide resistance through the involvement of a complex and multi-factorial biological network. in addition, most of genes or proteins previously suspected to contribute to glycopeptide resistance were identified in our study, confirming the robustness of our approach. finally, six potential targets found up-regulated at the transcript and protein levels are also shown to be over-expressed in a collection of s. aureus clinical isolates from unrelated genetic background showing reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides.

RESULTS
clonality of the studied strains
mlst performed with partial sequences of  <dig> genes revealed that strains mrgr <dig>  14- <dig> and 14-4rev displayed the same allele profile  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> for arcc, aroe, glpf, gmk, pta, tpi, yqil, respectively, corresponding to mlst  <dig> 

to further confirm the clonality of these strains, comparative genome hybridization was performed on an oligoarray covering the whole genome of staphylococcus aureus col, n <dig>  mu <dig> and mw <dig>  additional file  <dig> illustrates that susceptible strain mrgr <dig> and the gisa strain 14- <dig> displayed strictly identical fluorescence patterns on the  <dig> unique oligonucleotide probes  <cit> .

proteomic experiments
analysis by 2-de revealed striking similarities in protein expression of the two glycopeptide-susceptible strains . on the opposite, the protein pattern between the glycopeptide intermediate strain  and both susceptible strains appeared totally different . to document this high variability, quantitative proteomic experiments were performed on membrane-enriched fractions with ms-based approaches, using isobaric tags. isoelectric focusing of peptides was used as first dimension separation, prior to lc-ms/ms analysis. enrichment was evaluated by assaying the lactate dehydrogenase activity, a marker of cytosolic contents. enzymatic activity reached  <dig> u/g in total protein extract and  <dig> u/g in membrane protein.

all quantitative proteomics experiments were performed in duplicates. in the first experiment , 3' <dig> unique peptides corresponding to  <dig> proteins were identified from the bacterial membrane fraction. in the second experiment , 3' <dig> peptides corresponding to  <dig> proteins were identified. a total of  <dig> proteins were commonly identified in both experiments. together, these experiments yielded a total of  <dig> unique proteins, covering approximately 32% of the whole deduced proteome of s. aureus strain n <dig> .

among the 2' <dig> predicted orfs of strain n <dig>   <dig> protein products  are predicted to be integral membrane proteins . among the proteins identified during these two experiments, approximately 20% are predicted to be integral membrane proteins.

intense signal from the reporter fragment ions  was obtained for almost all peptides . relative quantification could therefore be performed on all  <dig> proteins differentially expressed between strain mrgr <dig> and 14- <dig>  on  <dig> proteins expressed between 14- <dig> and 14-4rev, and on  <dig> proteins between mrgr <dig> and 14-4rev. a list of these proteins is provided separately . tables contain the corresponding orf number, their relative abundance ratio as well as the coefficient of variation  of ratios from individual peptides belonging to the same protein. in average,  <dig>  peptides per protein were used for quantification. as shown in additional tables, the cv of individual peptide ratios belonging to the same protein is relatively high. when comparing glycopeptide-susceptible strains, mean cv value is  <dig> %, whereas it increased to  <dig> % between 14- <dig> and 14-4rev, and  <dig> % between 14- <dig> and mrgr <dig>  most identified peptides matched those of the nucleotide sequence-deduced  <cit>  peptides of strain n <dig>  however, when peptides were not found in n <dig> genome, orf numbers from other sequenced s. aureus strains are provided in the tables .

scatter plots of the proteomics ratio revealed very similar profiles in both glycopeptide-susceptible strains . the number of proteins out of the range - <dig>  to  <dig>   was  <dig>  and only  <dig> proteins appeared out of the range of - <dig>  to  <dig>  . on the opposite, important modifications of the distribution were observed between the gisa strain and any of the  <dig> glycopeptide-susceptible ones . the number of proteins found more abundant in one strain over the other was approximately  <dig> in the range of - <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig> in the range of - <dig>  to  <dig> , resulting in a scatter distribution instead of a 0-centered representation. the lists of identified proteins between the gisa strain and either of the susceptible strains revealed almost the same content as all but only  <dig> proteins were found in the two analyses, indicating excellent reproducibility of the membrane protein preparations. the experimental variability observed between quantifications of the two replicates was relatively important. figures 2b and 2c depict several proteins with divergent expression ratios between replicates. due to experimental variation, inherent to quantitative mass spectrometry techniques  <cit>  and illustrated by the relative high cv values of individual peptides from the same protein, a conservative approach was selected that considered only proteins significantly differentially expressed in both experiments. to this end, we considered the distribution between both glycopeptide-susceptible strains  as a gaussian normal distribution. threshold for significant differential expression was set at the 5th percentile of the most over- or under-expressed proteins  between both glycopeptide-susceptible strains .

a total of  <dig> proteins are differentially expressed between strains 14- <dig> and mrgr <dig>  and  <dig> proteins between strains 14- <dig> and 14-4rev, which corresponds to approximately 4% of the deduced proteome. together,  <dig> unique proteins are differentially expressed in the gisa strain. a list of these proteins is given in supplementary material . comparison reveals that more than 65% of these proteins are common between both lists obtained from comparison of the resistant strain with either of the two susceptible isolates. among these  <dig> lists, the most important categories involved proteins playing a role in: energy metabolism, amino-acids transport, cell envelope biosynthesis, protein turnover and inorganic ion transport . among the  <dig> categories represented, these  <dig> categories constituted 40% of the identified proteins.

transcriptomic analysis
genes with statistically significant changes in the level of expression and differences superior to two-fold changes were identified and listed for pairwise comparisons . according to these criteria, only  <dig> genes were differentially regulated between strain mrgr <dig> and 14-4rev, consisting in  <dig> % of the transcriptome. however, strain 14- <dig> compared to mrgr <dig> showed  <dig> differentially regulated genes, whereas 14- <dig> compared to 14-4rev showed  <dig>  in total,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified between gisa and both glycopeptide-susceptible strains. finally, these tables reveal that more than 65% of these genes were common. among the up- or down-regulated genes, the most represented transcripts were found in cog e, k and p corresponding to genes involved in amino acids transport, transcription and inorganic ions transport, respectively. thus,  <dig> out of these  <dig> categories were also found predominant in the quantitative proteome study.

correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data
the transcriptomic expression trends compared to the proteomic quantification for all identified proteins are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> for the comparison between the two sensitive strains and the gisa. this analysis reveals that an equivalent proportion of genes are regulated similarly in both comparisons.

the comparison between the proteomic expression direction  and the corresponding transcriptomic expression direction according to the functional classes  shows important similarities for most categories. however, two functional classes  show opposed quantification trends .

finally, strict comparison of significantly differentially expressed proteins and genes allowed us to identify  <dig> common orfs  showing the same transcript and proteins expression trends. among these genes,  <dig> are over-expressed whereas only two are under-expressed. in addition, sa <dig> that revealed strongly up-regulated in microarray experiments was also evaluated in quantitative analysis.

genetic relationships between strains showing glycopeptide intermediate level of resistance and identified markers expression
the expression ratio of the five over-expressed orfs at the gene and protein level in glycopeptide-intermediate strain 14- <dig> as well as the over-expressed transcript sa <dig> was measured on a collection of genetically unrelated strains . rapid genotype clustering  shows that our collection of strains displays at least five distinct genomic contents confirming that these strains are not genetically related. cluster a composed of mu <dig> and mu <dig> shows some relatedness with nrs <dig>  a strain isolated in the usa. this relatedness between the two japanese isolates has been documented previously  <cit> . cluster b contains the closely-related french isolates. patterns c and f contain only a single isolate . cluster d confirms that our set of isogenic strains is unique, and appeared clonal which is in accordance with the mlst and cgh results , and partially related to cluster e. finally, the  <dig> strains extensively documented in the present study appear clonal but clearly different from at least  <dig> other genotypes identified. as previously documented using pulse-field gel electrophoresis, our three strains appeared isogenic  <cit> .

expression levels of the  <dig> mrna markers potentially involved in the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance, assessed by quantitative pcr using specific oligonucleotides  is shown on figure 4b. important differences were observed between strains and their genetic backgrounds. all reference strains  showed marginal differences in terms of gene expression compared to other strains reported as glycopeptides-intermediate. the most variable markers were sa <dig> , sa <dig> and sa <dig>  which revealed importantly up-regulated in the vast majority of unrelated gisa strains. a similar expression pattern of these markers was found in our resistant strain 14- <dig> as in the ancestral gisa prototype, mu <dig> and its clonal derivative mu <dig> showing important up-regulation of all identified markers. taken together, these results illustrate the benefits of performing combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. indeed, both were necessary to obtain a global and holistic view of the state of the bacterial cells. on the opposite, analysis restricted to gene-expression or protein abundance may lead to important bias.

discussion
technical issues and challenges
the use of isobaric-tagging during isoelectric focusing prior to lc-ms/ms provided the possibility to quantitatively examine a large number of proteins for differential expression  <cit> . using membrane-enriched protein extracts from staphylococcus aureus during stationary phase, we consistently identified and quantified relative protein abundance for approximately 32% of the proteome when comparing pairs of strains. previously, we showed that only 23% of the proteome was accessible using different combinations of protein or peptide fractionation and numerous separation techniques  <cit> . the capacity to obtain extended proteome recovery, particularly from membrane fractions, represents one of the major bottlenecks in proteomic experiments. as expected from multiple previous reports, numerous soluble contaminants are identified from the membrane-enriched fractions. however, these compounds greatly enhance the number of identified proteins and contribute to the global picture of the proteome from a single cellular fraction. in addition, the removal of important fractions of abundant cytosolic proteins increases the number of low-abundance proteins linked to the bacterial membrane  <cit> . in this report, we concentrated on membrane-enriched fraction. our membrane purification process allowed reducing drastically the content of cell-wall anchored and cytosolic proteins, which constitute the most abundant fraction of cellular proteins by a 200-fold factor. based on the content of staphylococcus aureus proteome, this corresponds to approximately 4% contamination of membrane fraction by cytosolic proteins western blot performed with antibodies raised against s. aureus protein a showed that the contamination by cell-wall anchored proteins was marginal. the new approach with an ief separation of peptides leads to the identification of an appreciable part of the bacterium proteome, maximizing the chances to discover new targets involved in s. aureus glycopeptide resistance. in this respect, our analysis of s. aureus proteome allowed satisfactory representation of low-abundance or membrane proteins. in this work, 19% of the identified proteins constituted integral membrane proteins, a value close to the predicted transmembrane proteome  as deduced from the nucleotide sequence  <cit> . numerous examples of bacterial resistance against different antibiotic families involve membrane proteins  <cit> . membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to solubilize during tryptic digestion and, depending on the number of transmembrane domains, most of the fractionated peptides remain highly hydrophobic which is an important limitation during isoelectric focusing  <cit> . due to important differences between the three strains analyzed in this study, this aspect is of utmost importance. the mean cv of individual peptide ratios belonging to the same protein varies between  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  which is relatively low, based on the complexity of the whole experimental procedure. the sample variability certainly contributed to these variations, as we observed higher cvs for the comparison between susceptible and gisa strains. the high peptide recovery due to combination of ief, lc-ms/ms and labeling strategy is therefore essential for reliable protein quantification. similar quantitative profiles were obtained in each individual experiment, as shown on figure  <dig>  however, totally different profiles were observed between either of the two susceptible strains and the gisa . this observation is concordant with 2d-gel electrophoresis results which clearly illustrates divergent patterns between gisa and the susceptible strains.

whereas high-level glycopeptide resistance in s. aureus has been shown to rely on the horizontal transfer of vana gene from enterococcus faecalis  <cit> , the mechanisms involved in glycopeptide-intermediate resistance remain poorly understood and numerous potential mechanisms are currently explored  <cit> . they probably involve a complex and global gene expression and protein translation changes as well as protein processing alterations. the most documented modifications contributing to this phenotype involve profound modifications of cell-wall biosynthesis including increased cell-wall thickness, cross-linking, or accumulation of cell-wall components  <cit> . in this study, several targets involved in cell-wall synthesis were found differentially expressed either at the protein or transcript level, or at both levels. other potential hypothesis rely on the increased abundance of d-ala-d-ala residues, forming false-target trapping glycopeptides or to an altered regulation of cell-wall synthesis  <cit> . other potential mechanisms are related to the requirement of increased energy synthesis related to larger cell-wall contents, involving phosphoglycerate kinase  <cit> , or purine metabolism  <cit> .

in a cell, protein abundance is not strictly correlated to that of its cognate mrna levels. thus, a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach is warranted for genome-wide identification of molecular targets involved in the resistance mechanism. previous experiments performed in our laboratory showed that resistance to glycopeptides expressed by strain 14- <dig> remains stable even after numerous sub-cultures in antibiotic-free medium  <cit> . this resistant phenotype relies on constitutive changes in gene expression and is stable, thus not requiring drug induction. at stationary phase, a decoupling between protein and transcripts abundance is generally observed except for most of constitutive processes  <cit> , supporting our exploration of the transcriptome and proteome of s. aureus during this stage.

differentially expressed targets in gisa compared to susceptible strains
proteomics as well as transcriptomics studies revealed moderate numbers of differentially regulated genes or proteins. comparison of gisa strain with either of the  <dig> susceptible isolates showed a majority of common differentially expressed targets. in addition, a perfect correlation was observed for those common genes in the transcriptomic evaluation and the proteomic studies. genes or gene products known to be involved in different antibiotic resistance mechanisms, such as pbp <dig> , ant , mure , and the methicillin resistance-related autolysis protein fmta  were over-expressed in the gisa strain. in addition to these targets involved in cell-wall biosynthesis, many other proteins involved in cell-wall metabolism  were found over-expressed, such as sgtb  and ssaa . part of these compounds involved in cell-wall processing was reported to alter glycopeptide susceptibility  <cit> . these results were shown in gene expression study  <cit>  and are now confirmed on protein expression levels.

another important protein target found differentially expressed at the mrna and protein levels is the product of vrax gene . this gene belongs to the vra operon  encoding for genes initially described to be involved in imipenem resistance. most of these genes were up-regulated at the mrna levels together with sa <dig> and sa <dig> , located upstream and downstream of the vra region, respectively and suggesting contribution in glycopeptide resistance. motive search revealed that both genes, sa <dig> and sa <dig> harbored a putative phosphorylation site, suggesting a role in a regulatory process. regulatory systems contributed to the gisa phenotype, such as the two-component sensor histidine kinase, coded by the vrasr genes , previously shown as important in the development of resistance to either imipenem or glycopeptides  <cit> . our study reveals also that protein regulators are over-expressed, such as the signal transduction protein trap   <cit> , acting as a signal-transducer protein during quorum sensing  <cit> , the diviva protein  known to regulate cell division, or the putative transcription factor  and sarh <dig>  whose up-regulation is in accordance with a decreased expression of spa. finally, the over-expression of proteins involved in stress protection such as proteinases ctpa , msra and msrb  and the regulator msrr , contributing to the reparation of proteins inactivated by oxidation. these attenuators of transcription, mainly expressed during exponential phase are over-expressed by the gisa strain at the stationary phase and are also abundant at the protein level. this observation suggests that the gisa strain is constitutively in a stress state, despite absence of antibiotic exposure.

some proteins involved in purine biosynthesis were found slightly down-regulated in 14- <dig> compared to sensitive strains at the protein level, whereas none of the genes involved in this operon was found differentially expressed by microarray. this observation is in contradiction with a recent report showing a massive up regulation of the pur operon  <cit>  in gisa strains isolated in vitro. our study, performed on ex vivo derived clinical isolates involves probably different mechanisms yielding to the resistant phenotype. these differences illustrate also the importance of growth conditions and antibiotic resistance selection. indeed, these different conditions allow pointing out complementary mechanisms leading to reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. in our comparison, metabolic targets showing differential expression between gisa and susceptible strains concerned mainly the metabolism of arginine. arginine repressor is up-regulated and consequently argininosuccinate lyase expression is reduced as observed previously in response to cell-wall active antibiotics  <cit> . the potential effect is the decreased succinate and fumarate levels and the accumulation of aspartate. aspartate is a central compound involved in numerous metabolic functions such as amino acids synthesis, urea cycle or energetic transports and cell-wall synthesis. another category of targets found differentially regulated in our study is abc transporters. some of these compounds have been proposed as targets for immunotherapy  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> abc transporters were found down-regulated in gisa compared to susceptible strain, suggesting that the gisa phenotype does not involve this type of target.

correlation of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles
in order to compare the transcriptomic profiles with the proteomic expression ratios, the differentially expressed proteins were compared to trend of gene-expression ratio . a significant part of the over-expressed proteins corresponds to down-regulated transcripts and suggests altered protein degradation. comparison of gisa with either of the sensitive strains showed similarities between up- or down-regulated functions between the transcriptome and the proteome for all functional classes. however, these tendencies are inverted for the cog functions o and p, corresponding to post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones; and inorganic ion transport and metabolism, respectively. indeed, most proteins in these functional groups are up-regulated whereas most transcripts are down-regulated. similarities are observed by comparing the glycopeptide intermediate strain with the two susceptible strains. the analysis revealed also that most of the expressions have the same trend in proteomic and in transcriptomic  but some regions showed different directions. these regions are probably composed of genes showing altered turn-over rates  <cit> , as previously observed  <cit> . finally, genes and proteins found differentially expressed showing the same trend represent potential targets for rapid diagnostic of evolution to gisa phenotype. these lists contain sa <dig>  , sa <dig> and sa <dig>  two hypothetical proteins and msrr. additionally, sa <dig> showing an elevated difference in expression between 14- <dig> and mrgr <dig> appeared also as a potential marker of interest. the expression at the mrna level was evaluated in a collection of unrelated strains showing altered susceptibility to glycopeptides. among our collection,  <dig> unrelated genetic backgrounds were identified and all of them displayed intermediate level of resistance to glycopeptides. the level of expression of  <dig> markers found up-regulated in our in vivo isolated strain was very similar to that observed in the ancestral gisa strains. one of these markers, sa <dig> , has been very recently identified as up-regulated in gisa strains  <cit> . in accordance with this report, sa <dig>  was found up-regulated in all the genetically unrelated strains of our study. however this study observed that the up-regulation of sa <dig>  is not related to vancomycin induction  <cit>  but is constitutive in all our strains. mcaleese suggested as "provocative findings" that the expression of several markers is constitutive as revealed by our work.

compared to the different studies published in the field and elaborating on potential mechanisms involved in glycopeptide resistance, this study was performed using gisa strains recovered in the absence of antibiotic pressure. however, most genes previously discovered in different gisa strains, either selected in vitro or in vivo, were also documented in our study. to the involvement of cell-wall biosynthesis as contributor of the gisa phenotype, our analysis now adds the discovery of new targets present in higher abundance in the gisa strains. our determination revealed also the contribution of the msr locus, as well as that of several transporters that could contribute to a more direct resistance mechanism. in that sense, the presence at the protein levels of these targets appeared as a strong evidence. thus, our results suggest that glycopeptide resistance is a stable phenomenon acquired by staphylococcus aureus and expressed in the absence of any selection pressure. finally, coupled to a rapid genotyping method, we identified markers potentially involved in the resistance mechanisms, potentially amenable to be used as diagnostic markers.

CONCLUSIONS
combined proteomic and transcriptomic analyses allowed obtaining a global view of complex processes involving differentially regulated factors contributing to antibiotic resistance. this combined information is essential for the global integration of the data. several potential genes and proteins leading to glycopeptide resistance were identified. this study provides the identity of targets potentially related to the bacterial evolution toward a gisa phenotype, thus a contribution to the elucidation of complex mechanisms leading to glycopeptide resistance. in view of the results found in the literature and additional information obtained in this study, we showed that our genetic background appeared particularly relevant and that multiple mechanisms are mobilized by staphylococcus aureus to evolve to the gisa phenotype. in addition, several markers reflecting the potential evolution of staphylococcus aureus to the gisa phenotype have been identified.
