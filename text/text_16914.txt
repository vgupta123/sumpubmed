BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming bacillus that causes anthrax  <cit> . this bacterium is commonly found in soil and is responsible for diseases of herbivores and other mammals including humans. anthrax is still endemic in many countries, middle east, africa, north, central and south america, as well as other areas of the world  <cit> . the site of entry determines different forms of anthrax, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation; the latter form is highly fatal, with a mortality rate of up to 80% in the absence of an adequate antimicrobial therapy.

yersinia pestis is a gram-negative bacterium, etiological agent of plague. the bacterium is transmitted by fleas or aerosols, causing different forms of plague: bubonic, septicemic or pneumonic  <cit> . y.pestis is often associated with the wellknown black death plague of the middle ages, a pandemic that had killed a third of european population in the 14th and 15th centuries, but approximately  <dig>  human cases still occur worldwide each year  <cit> . primary pneumonic plague is rapidly progressive and virulent, and, as inhalation anthrax, with a mortality rate close to 100% in the absence of a timely treatment. y. pestis and b. anthracis are both considered serious threats and potential bioterrorism agents  <cit>  because of their evaluation as bioweapons by soviet union and united states laboratories during the past decades. above all, b. anthracis gained renewed attention in  <dig>  when letters containing anthrax spores were mailed causing the death of five persons and infecting  <dig> others, while probably hundreds of people were exposed to infectious spores  <cit> . both agents are classified by the us centre for disease control and prevention in the bioterrorism disease agent list as category a microrganism, the most dangerous ones, because of easy dissemination and transmission, high mortality and impact to public health.

b. anthracis and y. pestis both show very low intraspecies genetic diversity  <cit> , making very challenging the rapid and accurate differentiation among individual biovars and strains. nevertheless, finding a way to differenziate the strains by molecular genotyping, remains essential for discrimination between naturally occurring versus intentional outbreaks. the importance of forensic microbiology, as this field is know called, was demonstrated during the  <dig> events, and previously by tokyo  <cit>  and sverdlovsk  <cit>  incidents. finally genetic characterization of isolates allows to increase information about worldwide bacterial distribution and epidemiology.

standard genotyping methods require either highly discriminative but heavy, and relatively expensive devices such as automated capillary electrophoresis devices, or cheaper, easy to use but more time consuming and with lower resolution power such as agarose gels . a new miniaturized platform for quantification and separation of nucleic acid molecules, agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, has shown accuracy, precision and high feasibility along with speed and moderate cost reagents. this platform is based on microfluidic technology and allows to analyze  <dig> dna samples in  <dig> minutes. the device, also called "lab on a chip", integrates multiple functions onto a single apparatus, so that sample dispensing, separation, detection and analysis are performed on the same support . along with limited weight and size , the above features make the instrument ideal for field use and other on-site investigations. agilent  <dig> can also be easily used by low-expertise staff. a similar system was previously employed to study the genetic variability of bcla gene for strain discrimination within the bacillus cereus group  <cit> . in this paper we evaluate this approach for genotyping analysis of the two major biothreat agents.

RESULTS
experimental design
in order to validate this platform, we compared the data produced by the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer to agarose gel based data  and capillary gel based data . ten y. pestis and thirty-nine b. anthracis strains were genotyped using previously described sets of  <dig> vntr loci  <cit> . these previously genotyped strains  <cit>  were chosen to be representative of allelic variability within the two species. briefly, these genotypes are from strains with the largest genetic distance, encompassing most of the observed allele variation . the  <dig> vntr markers amplified for bacterial genotyping, were arranged into  <dig> pcr multiplex reactions either for b. anthracis or y. pestis. this allowed us to use a single dna  <dig> chip for each strain.

after pcr amplification  <dig> μl of each reaction was loaded into 12-wells chip . primer concentrations were experimentally adjusted to obtain a balanced amplification of different fragments. this optimization was facilitated using the quantification data supplied by the  <dig> bioanalyzer . the vast majority of data produced by agilent  <dig> were not accurate. the discrepancies between observed and expected fragment size  are, presumably, the result of abnormal migration patterns of some repetitive sequences into electrophoretic matrix. in order to check if the offset was reproducible, we tested interchip and intrachip variability in markers containing the smallest repeat units, for which incorrect allelic calling is more probable. the samples were run in triplicate on the same and on different chips, and size data compared. in general, it was observed a low level of inter-intrachip variability . for example, for b. anthracis cg <dig> marker , we observed  <dig> ±  <dig> for allele  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> for allele  <dig>  to correctly convert the agilent dna fragment size estimates into repeat copy numbers, it was necessary to establish conversion tables  containing  <dig> bioanalyzer fragment sizes as well as actual sizes corresponding to repeats unit numbers, as previously reported  <cit> .

* modified primer set 

once these reproducible offset values are taken into account, the mlva assay as run on the agilent exhibited concordant results with previous typing results for b. anthracis and y. pestis  <cit> . we were able to resolve closely sized dna fragments, and the analyzed samples showed concordance either with interchip repetitions or with expected size data. these data, used for upgma cluster analysis, generate dendrograms with linkage distance perfectly identical to those previously obtained by standard methodologies . for each individual strain the agilent assay is completed in about  <dig> minutes after pcr amplification. for a single strain to be genotyped, this time is significantly lower than  <dig> hours described in previous assay  <cit> .

genotyping b. anthracis with the 25-loci mlva
to fit all the  <dig> loci into a 12-wells chip the b. anthracis loci were combined into  <dig> triplex,  <dig> duplex and  <dig> singleplex  pcr amplifications. the arrangement of different loci in the same multiplex is such as to avoid overlapping of vntr markers size ranges. for four b. anthracis loci multiplexing was impossible, because of the large allele size range.

primer sequences were as described in  <cit> , loci combination and final primers concentrations are reported in table  <dig>  under these conditions, we were able to amplify each expected fragment, and the software  could identify amplicon size . the offset values for all loci and alleles were measured and are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  for chromosomal markers, reproducibility of the observed data allowed correct assignment of each allele for every locus . however, for plasmid markers, since their shorter repeat unit and pcr product size compared to the chromosomal ones, we observed variability not exceeding one single additional base for each allele in repeated runs. even with this additional base, correct assignment could be reproducibly done for the plasmid loci.

genotyping y. pestis with the 25-loci mlva
to fit all the  <dig> loci into  <dig> chip wells the y. pestis  <dig> markers were grouped into  <dig> duplex and one triplex .

the majority of primer sequences were as described in  <cit>  but for  <dig> y. pestis markers new primer pairs were redesigned to allow multiplexing . thus, final amplicon size was increased to avoid any possible overlap with other different loci into the new multiplexed reactions . for y. pestis markers , we observed variability up to two bases  and, as previously described for b. anthracis, discrepancies not exceeding 25% of the repeat unit size.

discussion
the intentional release of anthrax spores by mail in  <dig> in the united states caused the death of five persons by inhalation anthrax and publicly demonstrated the bioweapon-associated threat, of which only the community of biodefence experts was previously aware. this increased the demands for a better genetic characterization of bioterrorism agents, in order to distinguish between natural outbreaks and/or intentional release of micro-organisms, and to help trace back the origin of an aggression. we have here evaluated the agilent  <dig> "lab on a chip" platform for genotyping of b. anthracis and y. pestis strains on. this assay runs in  <dig> minutes one  <dig> multiplexed pcr reactions chip, genotyping a single isolate at a time. for this reason this system is faster compared to automated sequencing devices, either slab gel or capillary based when a single strain has to be genotyped. given the possibility to compare different chip runs in different times this device can immediately show identities or diversities between new isolates compared to already characterized ones. moreover it has shown a high degree of automation either for amplicon separation or for digital output of results. compared to previous genotyping methods, the bionalyzer is more effective than standard ethidium bromide slab gel electrophoresis, giving reproducible, precise and more sensible output for the shortest repeat units. since no fluorescent primers are required the assay is cheaper to maintain than ceq <dig> or other sequencing machines. a rough estimation of the total cost of a  <dig> loci assay indicates that genotyping on this equipment is at least four to ten times less expensive than a capillary system assay, at low to medium throughput level. the equipment itself is cheaper, and both consumables and equipment can be stored for a long period of time and activated when needed.

finally, the results are comparable to those obtained by automated sequencers. this platform appears particularly useful when response time is the critical factor. we propose therefore such a system as a method suitable for high resolution identification of biothreat agents. to date this system is the most effective genotyping technology available for on-site investigations. also, this platform may be used for fast quality-checking of type collection, and dna preparations for biosecurity and strain accountability purposes. typing data produced by the mlva approach can be easily compared using shared internet databases, as illustrated for instance in  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we describe a fieldable genotyping method for b. anthracis and y. pestis. this method is an adaptation on agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer of previously described  <dig> loci mlva. the system was validated by characterizing thirty-nine b. anthracis and ten y. pestis isolates, demonstrating to be, for a single genotyping, more rapid than traditional methods. the transfer on a new platform maintains reproducibility and precision to unambigously identify alleles. this method is shown to be a valid alternative to standard genotyping techniques for field characterization of important biothreat agents.
