BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae  is a gram positive, facultative anaerobic bacterium that is the most common cause of neonatal and obstetric sepsis, and is an increasingly important cause of septicaemia in elderly and immunocompromised patients  <cit> . serotype iii gbs causes approximately 37% of early-onset and 67% of late-onset neonatal gbs sepsis , and is the predominant serotype causing late-onset meningitis  <cit> . serotype v prevails in invasive infection in non-pregnant adults   <cit> . the genetic determinants of the propensity of serotype iii gbs to cause late-onset sepsis and meningitis have not been fully elucidated, but the availability of whole genome sequences of a serotype iii isolate  and a serotype v isolate  brings this prospect closer  <cit> . one possibility is that the serotype iii gbs has pathogenicity islands  that are not present in the other serotypes, and which confer an enhanced invasive potential. glaser et al.  <cit>  described fourteen regions of strain nem <dig> that they considered to be putative pais. these islands are composed of  <dig> to  <dig> genes and contain most of the mobile elements in the nem <dig> genome  <cit> . six of the islands are adjacent to trna genes, a feature of pathogenicity islands  <cit> , and many known or putative virulence genes of gbs are contained within these regions. for instance, alp <dig>  <cit>  is in 'island iv', the cyl operon  <cit>  is in 'island vi', and lmb and scpb are in 'island xii'  <cit> . pais are defined by the following criteria:  they carry one or more virulence genes,  they are present in the genome of pathogenic bacterium but absent in non-pathogenic representatives of the same species,  they are frequently located adjacent to trna genes,  they are associated with mobile genetic elements and are often flanked by direct repeats ,  they are unstable and either the whole of the pai or part of it may be deleted, and  often represent mosaic like structures rather than homogenous segments of horizontally acquired dna  <cit> .

we used the c. elegans database genome sequence graphical interface   <cit>  to compare the strain nem <dig> and the strain 2603vr genome sequences to identify serotype iii and v genomic differences, and to further define the putative pais in the nem <dig> serotype iii strain. we then conducted pcr amplification and targeted microarray-based comparative genome hybridization  studies aimed at delineating the nature of the putative pais.

RESULTS
ncbi and acedb analysis of the sequenced serotype iii and v genomes
side-by-side comparison of the serotype iii and v genome sequences, strains nem <dig> and 2603vr respectively, identified numerous annotation differences between open reading frames, most generated by true or sequencing error frame shifts and differences in the annotation of initiation codons. the similarity of the two genomes is otherwise remarkable . the other major differences between the two genomes are the capsulation loci and the presence of multiple mobile elements including integrated plasmids, prophages, transposons, and one to two gene integrases/transposases. much of this acquired dna appears to be unique to each sequenced strain , in the type of mobile element but not necessarily the genomic location.

which islands appear to be real pais?
pais contain virulence and mobilization genes and are flanked by direct repeat  sequences that are recognised by mobilization proteins  <cit> . potential pais must be distinguished from non-mobile regions of the chromosome that contain virulence genes adjacent to trna genes, and which have merely attracted mobile elements. such mobile elements may themselves be genomic or metabolic islands but by definition they are not pais, unless they mobilize virulence genes and are associated with pathogenic strains  <cit> .

our annotation of the putative pais is given in table  <dig>  the putative pais are present in both strain nem <dig> and strain 2603vr, with the exception of islands iii, vii, viii and x, which are only present in strain nem <dig>  islands iii, vii, and viii were described as identical copies of a chromosomally integrated plasmid, designated pnem316- <dig>  two further islands are present in strain 2603vr that are not present in strain nem316: sag0915- <dig>  and sag1835- <dig> . none of these mobile elements contain known virulence genes, and they may therefore not be true pais.

inserted into the ends of islands ii, iv, v, xi, xiii and xiv, and the middle of island vi, are mobile elements that contain phage or transposon genes, but no known virulence genes . the mobile elements in strain nem <dig> are different from those in strain 2603vr at each of these sites of insertion. the putative pais do not otherwise contain mobilization genes or flanking dr sequences. island ix contains a two-component regulator, but has no mobilization genes. these putative pais may therefore merely represent non-mobile regions of the genome into which phages and transposons have inserted.

islands i, vi and xii contain virulence genes  flanked by mobilization genes that are present in both sequenced strains. island x contains mobilization genes and is presumed to be mobile because it is only found in strain nem <dig> and not strain 2603vr. it also contains genes encoding surface proteins that have an lpxtg signal sequence; these could potentially have a virulence role. four regions of the gbs genome  may therefore be real pais.

other genomic differences
aside from annotation discrepancies, mobile elements and the capsulation loci, there are few other differences between the two sequenced genomes. there is a possible lone example of a minimal mobile element   <cit> . two genes present between purk and purb  in strain nem <dig>  compared with a single different gene in the same location in strain 2603vr . the putative mme was pcr amplified in each of the  <dig> strains in our collection. only two insert types were amplified, of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp. representatives of these were sequenced and found to have the exact sequence of either gbs0045- <dig> or sag <dig>  respectively. all strains had either one or other insert between purk and purb. other inserts between purk and purb are identifiable in the genome sequences of other pathogenic streptococci , hence fulfilling the criteria for an mme.

another disparity between the two gbs whole genome sequences is the gene gbs <dig>  in strain nem <dig>  which has a different proximal half compared to its homologue sag <dig> in strain 2603vr.

the presence of putative pathogenicity islands as defined by cgh
the presence of putative pathogenicity islands as defined by cgh.  results of pcr  and cgh  analyses. the genes and gbs strains shaded grey in table  <dig> are those included in cgh experiments, table  <dig>  sag <dig> encodes dnaa, a positive control for pcr. the nem <dig> strain is a positive control. the pnem316- <dig> plasmid is located three times in the nem <dig> genome, and in figure  <dig> is represented as 'islands iii, vii and viii'. the strains are divided into three groups: colonizing strains from healthy pregnant women, and strains causing early- and late-onset sepsis in babies; and are sub-divided into those strains for which we have pcr results, and those for which we have pcr and cgh data.

some putative pais are almost always present in the strain collection
islands ii, iv, v, ix and xii-xiv are almost always present in every strain from our strain collection. an occasional gene could not be amplified in one or more strains. for instance, sag <dig>  located in the distal half of island xii, could not be amplified in strains j <dig>  b <dig>  mk <dig>  m <dig>  and j <dig> . however, sag <dig>  located in the proximal half of island xii, could be amplified in all strains. the whole genome comparison of strains nem <dig> and 2603vr revealed inter-strain sequence divergence at the distal end of island xii, whereas the proximal end of island xii, containing lmb/scpb , is highly conserved between these two strains . amplification of sag <dig> therefore best reflects the presence of the putative pai. sag <dig> may be particularly hard to pcr amplify because sequence divergence affects primer annealing. similar sequence divergence between strains may also explain our inability to amplify occasional genes in islands v and xiii.

these islands are present in all strains tested, whether isolated from disease or colonizing sites and therefore do not meet the pai definition criteria  and , above: that they should be present in pathogenic but absent from non-pathogenic strains, and they should be unstable and delete with distinct frequencies. colonizing is not necessarily synonymous with non-pathogenic, a fact that confounds interpretation of a genetic comparison of invasive and colonizing strains.

some putative pais are almost always absent in the strain collection
copies of pnem316- <dig>  represented by islands iii, vii and viii, are only found in strain nem <dig>  and are consistently absent from the other strains in our collection. five genes were amplified from island x. they were only all consistently amplifiable from strain nem <dig>  two or three genes from island x, however, were amplified in  <dig> strains other than nem <dig>  reflecting either the part presence of the island in these strains or marked sequence divergence. these islands, that are absent from most disease causing strains, are unlikely to be pais. however, the central part of island x is present in  <dig> strains known to have caused early-onset sepsis, and absent from all colonizing and late-onset sepsis strains.

some putative pais are variably present in the strain collection
two genes amplified from each of islands i and vi revealed a variable presence of these islands in the strains of our collection . island i is at least part-present in  <dig> of  <dig> colonizing strains ,  <dig> of  <dig> early-onset sepsis strains , and  <dig> of  <dig> late-onset sepsis strains . although island i meets the pai criteria of being variably present in the species, there is no relationship between the whole or part presence of the island and whether the strain was colonizing or disease causing. the two genes amplified from island i were sag <dig> and sag <dig>  sag <dig> is close to the only recognisable virulence gene in island i, rgg , and thus amplification of this gene reflects the presence of the most important part of the island. sag <dig> homologues are present in  <dig> of  <dig> colonizing strains , in  <dig> of  <dig> early-onset sepsis strains , and in  <dig> of  <dig> late-onset sepsis strains . thus, in this relatively small collection, there is no relationship between the presence of the distal half of island i and whether the strain was a colonizing or disease causing isolate.

island vi is at least part present in all colonizing strains,  <dig> of  <dig> early-onset sepsis strains, and all late-onset sepsis strains. there is therefore no relationship between the island and disease. the proximal marker gene sag <dig> is closer to the cyl locus  than the distal marker gene, sag <dig>  and therefore possibly better reflects the presence of a pai that contains tn <dig> transposon genes and the cyl locus. sag <dig> is present in  <dig> of  <dig> colonizing strains , in  <dig> of  <dig> early-onset sepsis strains , and in  <dig> of  <dig> late-onset sepsis strains . although these differences are not statistically significant, there is a trend towards the presence of this putative pai in late-onset sepsis strains. a larger study is required to bear out this finding.

comparative genomic hybridization analysis
comparative genomic hybridisation  analysis was performed on  <dig> of the  <dig> strains assessed by pcr. these  <dig> strains were randomly selected and included  <dig> of the  <dig> colonizing strains,  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates that caused early-onset sepsis, and  <dig> of the  <dig> strains that caused late-onset sepsis.

for probes to the island genes, the results of cgh  are near identical to those of pcr , with only a few exceptions. notable is the hybridization of strains z <dig> and k <dig> dna to the gbs <dig> gene probe, suggesting that this gene, and therefore possibly the whole or part of pnem316- <dig>  is present in these strains. however, the presence of pnem316- <dig> was not detected by pcr in these or any other strain except the control nem <dig> strain. thus, perhaps the gene sequence of pnem316- <dig> is divergent in strains z <dig> and k <dig> so that the primers for pcr were unable to anneal, or that cgh detected a similar gene to gbs <dig>  we propose that similar reasons account for the other few discrepancies that exist between the pcr and cgh results. in general, however, the cgh and pcr results are highly consistent.

although not the main focus of this study, the presence of the other genes for which probes were included on the sub-microarray was also assessed by cgh. eighty five percent of all the  <dig> probes included on the sub-microarray gave strong hybridization signals for all strains tested, indicating that at least for the region of the gene chosen for the probe design there is very little variability between the strains. however, hybridization to 15% of the probes was variable in at least three of the  <dig> strains tested. in most instances there was no probe hybridization, but occasionally the hybridization signal was reduced, suggesting sequence variation within the probe region. the genes with presumed sequence divergence encoded six sortases, ten proteins with an lpxtg signal sequence, two clp proteases, one abc transporter and five pts proteins, thirteen putative or known regulators, and sixteen other proteins . of these, several are genes with possible virulence enhancing roles , including three virulence regulators rgf   <cit> , a putative rofa-like protein   <cit>  and rogb   <cit> , two genes in the cyl operon   <cit> , cfb  encoding the camp factor  <cit> , and pava   <cit> , and are therefore worthy of further disease association studies. of note, putative homologues of the major virulence regulators of streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> , such as mga , rofa/nra , and rgg/ropb , and all the other identifiable regulators included on the array  are non-variable in their hybridization pattern, across the strain collection.

discussion
by combining the results of genome comparison and pcr/cgh analysis we can make the following arguments about the likelihood that each of the putative pais is a true pai:

island i may be a true pai. it contains the virulence regulator rgg, which is flanked by mobilization genes, and the whole island is variably present in strains of our collection. it does not appear to be found preferentially in gbs isolates that are known to have caused disease, but the number of isolates tested in this study may be too small to tease out small contributions of a pai to invasiveness. a confounding factor is that the colonizing isolates in our collection may have the capacity to cause disease. thus, our colonizing and disease isolates do not simply reflect non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains, respectively. this study is not powered to identify small contributions of a putative pai to the propensity of serotype iii to cause late-onset sepsis. only a very large study is likely to do this.

island ii is unlikely to be a true pai. in strains nem <dig> and 2603vr there are two different mobile elements inserted at the same relative genomic location into the proximal end of the island, neither of which appears to harbour virulence genes. this suggests that the proximal end of island ii is a hot spot for the insertion of mobile elements. furthermore, the distal half of island ii does not appear to have mobilization machinery and is present in all the strains within our collection. islands iii, vii and viii are near-identical copies of a chromosomally integrated plasmid, pnem <dig>  which contains no known virulence determinants and which is only present in strain nem <dig>  and is not present within other strains within our collection. thus, this plasmid is unlikely to be a pai.

islands iv and v are unlikely to be pais for the same reason as island ii. island vi may be a true pai as it contains the cyl locus adjacent to tn <dig> , has a mosaic-like structure, and is variably present in our strain collection. we cannot show a relationship between the presence of island vi and strains causing disease, but this may be due to limitations of the power of this study. island ix does not contain mobilization genes and is present in all strains within our collection, making it unlikely that it is a pai. island x is mobile, but does not contain obvious virulence determinants. the whole of island x is only found in strain nem <dig>  and parts of it within four other strains causing early-onset sepsis. there may thus be an association between the middle of island x, gbs1125- <dig>  and the capacity of an isolate to cause chorioamnionitis. early-onset sepsis in a newborn baby reflects invasive disease in a pregnant mother, whereas the fetus is merely a vulnerable secondary host. the potential association between island x and early-onset sepsis needs a larger study for clarification. island xi is mostly composed of a small mobile element present in strain nem <dig>  but not strain 2603vr, and does not contain known virulence genes.

island xii contains mobilization and virulence genes, has a mosaic like structure, the distal end of it is variably present in strains of our collection. it could therefore be a pai. our study does not have the power to identify an association between the presence of the island and disease. islands xiii and xiv are unlikely to be pais for the same reason as island ii.

CONCLUSIONS
the majority of late-onset meningitis, and to a lesser extent late-onset sepsis, is caused by serotype iii strains. there is likely to be a bacterial genetic basis for this invasive propensity. a comparison of the whole genome sequences of a serotype iii isolate, nem <dig>  and a serotype v isolate, 2603vr, is remarkable in the degree of similarity of the two strains, but there are some dissimilarities. these include open reading frame annotation discrepancies, genes that show sequence divergence between strains, an mme, mobile dna, and the capsulation loci. this study contributes to our understanding of pathogenesis by further delineating the nature of mobile elements in gbs. individual gbs isolates probably carry their own unique aliquot of horizontally acquired genetic material. only four  of  <dig> putative pais are likely to be real pais, but there is no absolute association of any of these four pais with strains causing disease. the strongest possible disease association is with island x and early-onset sepsis.
