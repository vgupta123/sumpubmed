BACKGROUND
some plants increase their cold tolerance to deal with low temperatures; this phenomenon is termed cold acclimation. during this process, various biochemical and physiological changes occur in plants, which make plants more cold tolerant. plants have different abilities to deal with low temperatures. plants that have adapted to cold environments increase their cold tolerance in response to low but nonfreezing temperatures. by contrast, plants that have adapted to subtropical and tropical climates, such as maize, rice, and tomato, generally have little cold tolerance and are unable to acclimate to cold temperatures  <cit> .

in recent years, many cold-regulated genes have been identified in plants under cold stress. the c-repeat binding factor  cold-responsive pathway is considered the best-known cold tolerance pathway in plants  <cit> . there are three cbf/dehydration-responsive element binding factor  <dig>  family members, including cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig>  , encoding dna-binding proteins of the apetala <dig> /ethylene response factor family  <cit> . overexpression of cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  or cbf <dig> of arabidopsis thaliana caused an increase in cold tolerance in the absence of cold stress in plants, showing that the cbf genes improve cold tolerance . studies have shown that overexpression of cbf genes increases the cold tolerance of a. thaliana  <cit> , brassica napus  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , and potato  <cit> , but not in tomato  <cit> .

the roles of cold-regulated genes in plant cold acclimation show that differential expression of genes is related to different cold adaption abilities of plants. in a. thaliana and chorispora bungeana, many alterations in gene expression begin within minutes of transferring plants to a low temperature . moreover, some studies have demonstrated that differential expression of a cold-responsive gene is caused by differences in cold tolerance in plants  <cit> . for example, there are considerable differences in cold-responsive genes in solanum tuberosum and solanum commersonii, which are closely related but have different cold tolerances  <cit> .

a large number of cold-related genes have been identified using transcript analysis techniques, and the products of cold-related genes, including regulatory proteins and functional proteins, are thought to play key roles in gene expression and signal transduction . the expression and alternative splicing  of some serine/arginine-rich  genes, which encode splicing factor proteins that are vital for splicing and constitutive expression, vary under cold stress . cold stress affects the expression of splicing factors; therefore, the splicing of precursor-mrnas  of other genes are altered under cold stress. as of pre-mrna is an important mechanism for increasing transcriptome and proteome variety in eukaryotes. as has been confirmed widely at the functional level in a. thaliana, rice, and maize . as may be regulated spatially and developmentally under environmental stress ; thus, as could play an important role under cold stress or other abiotic stress.

micrornas  have been discovered in plants , changing our perception of the mechanisms of gene expression, transcription, and translation. in plants, 21– <dig> mirnas are negative regulators of gene expression  <cit> . the pool of mirnas in plants is highly diverse . many studies have indicated that the key role of mirnas is regulating organ development and biological processes . mirnas are also associated with abiotic stress responses . in accordance with their regulatory roles, many mirnas target genes that have roles in developmental patterning and show unique development-specific, tissue-specific, and stress-induced expression patterns  <cit> . however, to date, only  <dig> annotated tomato mirnas have been deposited in the mirbase database v <dig> , and only a few mirna targets have been confirmed experimentally. at present, it is unknown whether important regulators such as mirnas play a vital role in tomato’s response to cold stress.

the cultivated tomato species  suffers from cold stress at all stages of growth and development; by contrast, the wild tomato species  grows well at low temperatures . to understand the molecular basis underlying why s. habrochaites can acclimate to cold and survive freezing temperatures, whereas s. lycopersicum cannot, we report the results of an rna sequencing  transcriptome and mirna analysis of rna populations obtained from cold-treated leaves of the two plants. the results showed that many changes in the s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites transcriptomes occur in plants transferred from warm to cold conditions. we predicted that at least 21 % and 23 % of genes were cold responsive in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites, respectively. a gene ontology  term enrichment analysis of the data indicated that many go terms  were significantly enriched in the cold-responsive genes between the two species. our data also provided an evaluation of as between s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites. rna-seq identified many annotated introns, known as, and  <dig>  novel splice junctions. we identified  <dig> mirna sequences and  <dig> targets of  <dig> mirnas. our data showed that some mirnas  play important roles under cold stress in the two species. these results provided a new insight into the roles of mirnas under cold stress in these two closely related species under cold stress. thus, the differences in gene expression, as events, and mirnas under cold stress may contribute to the differences in the cold tolerance between s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites.

RESULTS
phenotypic and physiological responses to cold stress
solanum lycopersicum and s. habrochaites leaf tissue were chosen to study cold responses. the degree of cold stress was identified by malondialdehyde  content, proline content, peroxidase  activity, and catalase  activity exchange in the leaves. s. habrochaites exhibited less severe wilting than s. lycopersicum after 10 days of treatment at 4 °c . cold stress caused significant increased mda content, proline content, pod activity, and cat activity in these plants .

solanum lycopersicum and s. habrochaites transcriptome analyses
the transcriptomes of s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites  under cold stress were analyzed by rna-seq using the illumina genome analyzer ii. after growth at 25 °c for 12 weeks, plants were moved to 4 °c for  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h, and the total rna from leaves was extracted and analyzed. more than  <dig> million reads were produced, with approximately  <dig>  million reads from each sample. we aligned the reads to the entire reference genome sequence of tomato  using the tophat tool. the tolerance was set to allow two mismatches at most for reads in each alignment. using these criteria,  <dig> – <dig>  % of the reads mapped uniquely to a genomic location, and  <dig> – <dig>  % of the reads were filtered out as multiple-mapped or low-quality reads. alignment of the reads to tomato cdnas demonstrated that 70 % of the tomato genome-annotated cdnas had a sequence represented by illumina rna-seq reads . compared with the annotated tomato genome, the rna-seq data revealed that  <dig> –95 % of the reads that matched to the genome mapped to annotated genic regions, but only 5– <dig>  % of the reads mapped to intergenic regions . the depth of coverage along the length of the transcripts reduced towards the 5′ termini for rna-seq data derived from the full-length cdna libraries . de novo assembly was performed using the trinity method with default parameters  <cit> . overviews of the assembly results are shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the reads were assembled into  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes  in s. habrochaites.table  <dig> number of reads sequenced and mapped with tophat

the number of unique mapping reads plus multiple mapping reads equals the total number of alignments. c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> represent s. lycopersicum cold treatment for 0 h, 1 h and 12 h, respectively; tsh <dig>  tsh <dig> and tsh <dig> indicate s. habrochaites cold treatment for 0 h, 1 h and 12 h, respectively



to verify the rna-seq data, some genes whose expressions increased, some that decreased, and some that showed no change in abundance were chosen for real-time pcr  under cold stress. the results of rna-seq and qpcr were similar , showing the same general expression trends by qpcr as were revealed by rna-seq.

to identify s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites mirnas that affect gene regulation under cold stress, six mirna libraries were constructed from the leaves of s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites that were or were not treated with cold. the six mirna libraries were sequenced using high-throughput rna-seq and yielded approximately  <dig>  million raw reads in each sample. we excluded the poor-quality reads and those whose length was smaller than  <dig> nucleotides from further analysis. finally, we obtained approximate  <dig>  million non-redundant reads  in each sample .

differential expression and go enrichment
to study the impact of cold stress on gene expression in s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites , the transcript abundance of each gene was identified by the reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped method . to compare the transcriptomes in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites under cold stress, a heat map was generated to present the transcript abundance for all differentially expressed genes  under cold stress at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h . the results showed that a series of changes in gene expression in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites occur when plants are moved from warm to cold conditions. moreover, the gene expression patterns for s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites were dissimilar. for example, cluster a genes were little affected at 1 h in s. lycopersicum and returned to low transcript abundance levels at 12 h of cold stress; cluster b genes were unaffected in s. lycopersicum at 1 h of cold stress, but were highly increased at 12 h; cluster c or d genes were little affected after cold stress in s. lycopersicum, but were affected in s. habrochaites .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites  transcripts at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h of cold treatment at 4 °c



we used a threshold of a minimum 2-fold change in abundance between any two time points to define degs in the following analysis . the results showed that ~4 % , ~10 % , ~5 % , and ~8 %  of the unigenes were cold induced; and ~2 % , ~9 % , ~6 % , and ~9 %  were cold repressed. in s. lycopersicum, transcripts for  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes increased at  <dig> and 12 h, respectively, and  <dig> unigenes increased at both time points tested; transcripts for  <dig> and  <dig>  unigenes decreased at  <dig> and 12 h, respectively, and  <dig> unigenes decreased at both time points tested . in s. habrochaites, transcripts for  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes increased at  <dig> and 12 h, respectively, and  <dig> unigenes increased at both time points tested; transcripts for  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes decreased at  <dig> and 12 h, respectively, and  <dig>  unigenes decreased at both time points tested. moreover, in s. habrochaites, transcripts for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes increased at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h, respectively, compared with s. lycopersicum at same time points; and transcripts for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes decreased at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h, respectively. in sum, the gene expression profiles in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites changed under cold stress to different degrees; however, there were some overlapping genes that were regulated by low temperature in both tomato species.fig.  <dig> the number of total ests that were either cold-induced or cold-repressed by 2-fold change in s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites . the results from  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h of cold treatment at 4 °c

we analyzed the genes that we determined to be responsive to cold at 1 h. the go terms enriched in each species were comparable  and were generally related to “response to abiotic stimulus”. from the heat map, it was also obvious that s. lycopersicum was less affected by cold than s. habrochaites at 1 h. the expressions of genes that were enriched in go categories corresponding to “cell wall metabolism” were increased under cold stress in s. lycopersicum, but the opposite result was observed in s. habrochaites. we observed a similar contrast in the go category “response to organic substance”. in the go categories “response to chitin”, “response to carbohydrate stimulus”, and “dna-binding wrky”, there was a significant enrichment in s. lycopersicum, but s. habrochaites showed no enrichment. for the categories “chloroplast”, “transit peptide”, “pentatricopeptide repeat”, “phenylpropanoid metabolic process”, “flavonoid metabolic process”, and “amino acid derivative biosynthetic process”, no significant enrichment was observed in s. lycopersicum, but enrichment was observed in s. habrochaites .

we then compared responses to cold at 12 h. the analysis of go terms for cold-regulated genes suggested that the categories “response to organic substance”, “response to endogenous stimulus”, “response to hormone stimulus”, “response to abscisic acid stimulus”, “pentatricopeptide repeat”, “response to abiotic stimulus”, “response to ethylene stimulus”, “serine/threonine-protein kinase”, “phenylpropanoid metabolic process”, “amino acid derivative biosynthetic process”, “lignin biosynthetic process”, and “flavonoid metabolic process” were enriched in both s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites . in the case of the go category “udp-glucuronosyl/udp-glucosyltransferase”, there was significant enrichment for s. lycopersicum, but not for s. habrochaites.

alternative splicing in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites
to study the effect of cold stress on as in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites, we compared splicing events between the two tomato genotypes. we identified splice junctions using the tophat software  <cit> . collectively, using rna-seq data, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  splice junctions in samples c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  tsh <dig>  tsh <dig>  and tsh <dig> with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  novel junctions, respectively . we categorized each as event using the primary known types of as and the sequencing data . as previously reported , we found that intron retention was the primary type of as.table  <dig> classification of all detected alternative splicing events in tomato

we tried to identify differences in altered as events between the two species at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h of cold treatment at 4 °c. then,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  as events were increased under cold stress;  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  events were decreased . table  <dig> shows that as occurred more frequently in genes regulated in response to cold at 12 h than in genes at 1 h.table  <dig> altered alternative splicing events between s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites

next,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  of the as genes were increased under cold stress;  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  of the genes were decreased . certain as events are associated with specific abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . an observation of individual events under cold stress showed that certain as genes are cold associated .fig.  <dig> the total number of differentially alternative splicing genes  in s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites  at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h of cold treatment



the as event of diacylglycerol acyltransferase  under cold stress is shown in fig. 3c. the tophat-generated s. habrochaites diacylglycerol acyltransferase mrna model predicted a distinct as event that yielded a splice isoform that retains intron  <dig> . accumulation of the no intronr 4-containing transcripts decreased approximately three-fold under cold treatment. other examples of cold stress-associated as genes  are provided in additional file 20: figure s <dig> 

we compared the functions of the as genes that were regulated in response to cold at 1 h and 12 h with the degs. cold-regulated differentially expressed as genes overlapped with degs in s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites , and these genes were in the go categories “dephosphorylation” and “phosphoprotein phosphatase activity” , suggesting these activities were present in both plants. in the case of the go categories “detection of light stimulus”, “phenylpropanoid metabolic process”, “response to cadmium ion”, “phosphoinositide binding”, and “heat shock protein binding”, there was significant enrichment for s. lycopersicum, but s. habrochaites showed no enrichment. for the categories “carboxylic acid catabolic process”, “proteolysis”, “cell death”, “reproductive developmental process”, and “ethylene mediated signaling pathway”, no enrichment was observed in s. lycopersicum, but significant enrichment was observed in s. habrochaites .

impact of cold stress on mirnas in tomato
to identify mirnas in tomato, we analyzed mirnas by blast searches against the tomato genome sequence by bowtie . the novel mirnas were then identified by the mirdeep <dig> tool. the sequences corresponding to the known non-coding rnas  were filtered out using blastn to search the rfam database  . the remaining sequences were assigned as either other endogenous small rnas or mirna candidates and used for a fold-back structure prediction. we compared the unique mirnas with the mirbase database . in this analysis, the mirnas were required to show a perfect or nearly perfect match  to known mirnas. after these analyses,  <dig> unique mirna were obtained as novel mirna candidates .

a large number of mirna sequences were produced by illumina sequencing, permitting us to confirm the relative abundance of mirnas in tomato. to study the expression dynamics of mirnas and their potential roles in gene expression regulation in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites, the transcript abundance of each mirna was evaluated by transcripts per million . the tpm of the mirnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  , suggesting that the expression of mirnas varied greatly in tomato . mir <dig> and mir396a were the most abundant mirnas in the six sequencing datasets. according to the tpm, some mirnas  were highly expressed in tomato, with a tpm of greater than  <dig> each. mir <dig>  mir171a, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir1919a were moderately expressed and had a tpm between  <dig> and  <dig>  mir <dig>  mir169b, mir <dig>  mir171c, and mir395a represent mirnas with low expression and a tpm of less than  <dig> . sequence analysis showed that the relative abundance of some members in one mirna family changed considerably in tomato. for example, the tpm for mir396a was  <dig> , whereas the tpm for mir396b was only  <dig>  .

to detect the effect of cold stress on mirnas, the expression of mirnas in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites seedlings with and without cold treatment was examined. fourteen , eight , two , and four  of the mirnas were cold induced; seven , six , five , and eight  of the mirnas were cold repressed . in response to cold treatment, the most significant change was observed for mir169c, whose expression level increased approximately 35-fold in sample c <dig> compared with c <dig>  the expressions of some mirnas in s. habrochaites were opposite to those in s. lycopersicum under cold stress. for example, mir1919a–mir1919c, and mir396b were upregulated under cold stress for 1 h in s. lycopersicum, whereas they were downregulated in s. habrochaites . in contrast, mir172a and mir172b were downregulated by cold stress for 1 h in s. lycopersicum, while they upregulated in s. habrochaites by cold stress for 12 h.fig.  <dig> the total number of micrornas  that were either cold-induced or cold-repressed in s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites 



we used psrnatarget  to predict targets for the mirnas. for the mirnas that were annotated as described above, we identified  <dig> mrna targets . from fig.  <dig> it was also evident that s. lycopersicum was more affected by 1 h of cold than s. habrochaites. to further characterize the role of the mirnas in response to cold, we examined the target list for genes that could be related to the cold response and that were either induced or repressed by cold, based on our illumina results . for example, one of the predicted targets was the transcript of the homeodomain leucine zipper class i  protein  . athb <dig> is induced in s. lycopersicum after cold treatment for 12 h based on our sequencing data . the mirna predicted to target athb <dig> is mir <dig>  our sequencing data showed that mir <dig> was downregulated in s. lycopersicum after cold stress for 12 h . based on our sequencing data, we did not find differential expression of mir <dig> after cold treatment for 1 h in s. lycopersicum. the induction of athb <dig> under cold stress for 12 h correlates with mir <dig> repression by cold, suggesting that athb <dig> levels are post-transcriptionally regulated by this mirna in response to cold. thus, mir6022/athb <dig> represents an abiotic stimulus module that could be important for the cold response in s. lycopersicum leaves. other examples of cold stress-associated mirnas  are provided in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> the total number of targets of differentially expressed micrornas  that were either cold-induced or cold-repressed in s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites 



for comprehensive annotation, all putative target genes in each sample were analyzed by go terms using the david program. an analysis of go enrichment for the targets revealed that target functions were enriched in many different biological processes . among the mrna targets that were upregulated in response to cold at 1 h and 12 h, comparable cold-regulated mrna target expression was observed between s. lycopersicum  and s. habrochaites  in relation to the go terms , which included “atp binding” and “nucleotide binding” in both species. in the case of the go categories “leaf development”, “shoot development”, “ccaat-binding factor”, “cbf”, “regulation of rna metabolic process”, “cell death”, “gene silencing”, “immune response”, “flower development”, “atpase activity”, and “leucine-rich repeat”, there was significant enrichment in s. lycopersicum, but not in s. habrochaites. for the categories “response to cold” and “hormone stimulus”, no enrichment was observed in s. lycopersicum, but significant enrichment was observed in s. habrochaites .

among the targets that were determined as downregulated in response to cold at 1 h and 12 h, an analysis of go enrichment showed “defense response”, “atp binding”, and “nucleotide binding” in both s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites. in the case of the go categories “leucine-rich repeat”, “reproductive structure development”, “meristem development”, “intracellular signaling cascade”, and “response to hormone stimulus”, there was no significant enrichment in s. habrochaites, but s. lycopersicum showed enrichment.

discussion
plants have different abilities to deal with low temperatures. the cultivated tomato  suffers from cold stress, but the wild species  does not . rna-seq of cold-stressed s. lycopersicum leaves and a comparison with the transcriptome of s. habrochaites are presented here. the results revealed the effects of cold stress on transcript abundance in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites; 21 % and 23 % of transcripts in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites, respectively, are cold regulated. there is a large overlap in the genes that were cold responsive in both plant species, but the results indicated many differences in the cold-responsive genes of the two species . the diversity of go categories that were enriched in cold-stressed s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites  indicated the complexity of the response.

for cold-regulated degs of s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites, some similar clusters of go categories “response to abiotic stimulus” was found in both plants , confirming earlier observations  <cit> . however, in response to cold stress in s. lycopersicum at 1 h, many genes encoding proteins associated with the abiotic stimulus response showed increased transcript abundance, and a few genes showed decreased transcript abundance .

the data also suggested that some go terms overlap in cold-treated s. habrochaites, but not in s. lycopersicum . some photosynthesis-related go terms were significantly enriched among the upregulated genes in s. habrochaites under cold stress at 1 h. the results indicated that photosynthesis-related genes in cold regulatory programs might contribute to transient cold tolerance of s. habrochaites. in  <dig>  liu et al. studied the transcriptomes of s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites under cold stress at 3 days using genechip  <cit> . their experiments indicated that s. lycopersicum showed more severe inhibition of photosynthesis than s. habrochaites during chilling stress.

the data showed that the go category “cell wall metabolism” was enriched with genes with increased expression in cold-treated s. lycopersicum at 1 h, but the opposite result was observed for cold-treated s. habrochaites at both  <dig> and 12 h . a go term enrichment analysis indicated that “cell wall metabolism” was significantly depressed in the long term by cold stress in s. habrochaites, but was transiently induced by cold stress in s. lycopersicum. the present findings in s. habrochaites are similar to those of fowler and thomashow  <cit> , who used a microarray chip to analyze the transcriptome of arabidopsis under cold stress.

hormones are signaling molecules that play key roles in regulating gene expression under cold stress  <cit> . rna-seq analysis showed that many genes related to abscisic acid, ethylene, auxin, jasmonic acid, and gibberellin were regulated by cold stress in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites . two hormone-related go terms, “response to abscisic acid stimulus” and “response to ethylene stimulus”, were significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites under cold stress . in s. lycopersicum, our data show that aba-related go terms were significantly enriched among the upregulated genes under cold stress at 12 h and were not enriched at 1 h. in contrast, aba-related go terms were significantly enriched among the upregulated and downregulated genes under cold stress at multiple time points in s. habrochaites. the production of ethylene also has been associated with cold stress . in s. lycopersicum, our data show that ethylene-related go terms were significantly enriched among the upregulated genes under cold stress at multiple time points. in contrast, ethylene-related go terms were only significantly enriched among the upregulated genes under cold stress at 12 h, but not at 1 h, in s. habrochaites.

transcription factors  play a key role in the regulation of gene expression under abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. the rna-seq results showed that many tfs were regulated under cold stress in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites, and some members of the cbf were upregulated under cold stress at 1 h or 12 h . two additional cold-regulated genes were found that encode transcription factors: a homolog of cys2/his2-type zinc-finger protein  and a zinc finger protein involved in high light and cold stress . indeed, the rna-seq results showed that the transcript levels of a myc-type bhlh transcription factor  increased under cold stress at 1 h, and decrease after 12 h.fig.  <dig> diagram of cold-responsive transcriptional network in plant. solid arrows indicate activation, whereas lines ending with a bar show negative regulation. abbreviations: cbf, c-repeat binding factor ; ice <dig>  inducer of cbf expression  <dig> ; los <dig>  low expression of osmotically responsive genes  <dig> ; zat <dig>  a zinc finger protein involved in high light and cold acclimation; zat <dig>  related to cys2/his2-type zinc-finger proteins found in higher plants; kin <dig>  encodes protein kinase apk2a; erd <dig>  encodes a gene induced by low temperature and dehydration



as of pre-mrna is an important mechanism to increase transcriptome and proteome variation in eukaryotes. previous examinations of as events under abiotic stress showed that some as events are stress related  <cit> . different coverage of mrna isoforms in rna-seq was observed under abiotic stress, likely reflecting the regulation of as events. here, we used rna-seq to identify the as events in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites that differed under normal conditions and cold stress treatment. compared with other methods, rna-seq supplies a wide and deep sequencing of the transcriptome, providing experimental confirmation of splice junctions and as events with low false-positive rates. our data provide an exceptional and impartial evaluation of as in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites. the results were similar to those of filichkin et al.  <cit> , who used a. thaliana rna-seq data to compare the specific abiotic stress transcriptomes of a. thaliana. the authors identified  <dig>  novel as events within the introns of  <dig>  genes.

our rna-seq analysis of the s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites transcriptomes suggests numerous genes with as may be associated with cold stress . the expressions of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  as genes were increased under cold stress; and the expressions of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes decreased . most of the genes identified as undergoing cold-induced as were transcripts whose levels remained constant under cold stress. thus, despite the lack of change in transcript expression level, their coding ability could be very different.

recently, mirnas have been identified as new players in plant tolerance to abiotic stress, such as cold, heat, high salinity, drought, oxidative, hypoxia, and uv b  <cit> . many studies have attempted to understand the roles of mirnas in the response to cold in several plants, including a. thaliana  <cit> , brachypodium distachyon  <cit> , oryza sativa  <cit> , and populus trichocarpa  <cit> . in this study, sequencing was used to confirm the genome-wide mirna expression patterns of s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites under cold stress.

some mirnas in different plant species present different expression patterns under cold stress. for example, the expression of mir <dig> was inhibited after cold stress at 1 h in s. lycopersicum, but was induced in s. habrochaites after cold stress at 12 h . additionally, mir <dig> was upregulated in a. thaliana  <cit>  and b. distachyon  <cit> . similarly, mir170/ <dig> expression was upregulated under cold stress at 1 h in s. lycopersicum, while the transcript level of mir170/ <dig> was decreased under cold stress at 12 h in s. habrochaites. the transcript level of mir170/ <dig> was upregulated in a. thaliana  <cit>  and downregulated in oryza sativa  <cit>  and populus trichocarpa  <cit>  in response to cold.

CONCLUSIONS
s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites are closely related plant species, but their cold tolerances are different. in recent years, our research group has investigated the cold-tolerance mechanisms of these plants at the physiological and molecular levels. here, we studied the transcriptomes of cold stressed leaves of s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites. we obtained  <dig>  assembled unigenes, and many cold-regulated genes were detected, representing useful resources for gene cloning to improve cold tolerance of crops. furthermore, the comparison of the functional networks of cold-regulated genes in s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites provided information that could help us to identify the differences in cold-tolerance mechanisms between s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites. we found that 21 % and 23 % of genes were differentially expressed between the cultivated and wild tomato species, respectively, when plants were transferred from warm to cold temperatures. an as analysis suggested that the relative abundance of isoforms of s. lycopersicum and s. habrochaites significantly shifted under cold stress. in addition, certain mirnas  play roles in the response to cold stress. thus, differences in cold regulatory mechanisms may contribute to the differences in cold tolerance of these two tomato species.
