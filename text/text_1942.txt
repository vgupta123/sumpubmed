BACKGROUND
genome duplication and chromosome segment duplications are recognized as some of the most important mechanisms driving evolutionary change and speciation, with new gene functions arising as a result of gene redundancy occurring after a genome duplication  <cit> . the common ancestor of extant salmonid fishes is thought to have been an autotetraploid generated during a 4th vertebrate genome duplication event , which took place 25– <dig> mya  <cit> . a consequence of this is that the number of chromosome arms  in salmonids generally varies between 96– <dig>  <cit>  compared to most teleost species, especially freshwater groups, which have a karyotype of  <dig> pairs of acrocentric chromosomes and nf of 48– <dig>  <cit> . the re-diploidization process which occurs after a genome duplication is not well understood, but an increase in the frequency of repetitive elements such as transposons  <cit>  and a reduction in chromosome number through robertsonian fusions, translocations, pericentric inversions and deletions are thought to be important mechanisms changing the genome architecture  <cit> . chromosomal re-arrangements include fusions that change the karyotype by fusing acrocentric chromosomes, fissions that split a metacentric chromosome at the centromere, giving two acrocentric chromosomes and translocations that move part of one chromosome, often an entire arm, to another chromosome  <cit> .

the atlantic salmon  represents an important model for studying the mechanisms under-lying vertebrate chromosome re-arrangements and re-diploidization because of the recent genome duplication and varying modal chromosomal numbers in populations. the european atlantic salmon metapopulation extends from northern europe to spain, while the north american atlantic salmon metapopulation is found in the northeastern usa and canada  <cit> . there is a large body of evidence indicating molecular genetic divergence between european and north american atlantic salmon  <cit>  including studies of allozymes  <cit> , mini- and micro-satellites  <cit> , rdna polymorphisms  <cit>  and variation in mtdna  <cit> . moreover, fish belonging to these two metapopulations show differences in chromosome number and structure, which allow them to be classified as having either a european or north american karyotype  <cit> . european atlantic salmon generally have  <dig> pairs of chromosomes and  <dig> chromosome arms  <cit> , whereas it has been reported that north american atlantic salmon have  <dig> chromosome pairs and an nf of  <dig>  <cit> . the european karyotype consists of  <dig> pairs of metacentric chromosomes together with  <dig> pairs of small- and  <dig> pairs of large-acrocentric chromosomes. by contrast, the standard north american karyotype comprises  <dig> pairs of metacentric chromosomes,  <dig> pairs of short- and  <dig> pairs of long- acrocentric chromosomes  <cit> . the differences in karyotype between the two metapopulations include an additional metacentric chromosome in the north american karyotype, which is most likely derived from a robertsonian fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes  <cit> . also the european chromosome, ssa <dig>  is significantly larger than its north american counterpart and has an extra c-band on the q-arm, indicating a tandem fusion, differentiating the arm into ssa01qa and ssa01qb. a minimum of eight chromosomalrearrangements have been proposed to explain the chromosomal differences between north american and european salmon  <cit> . in a study based on linkage mapping in a single north american salmon family from the saint john river, lubieniecki et al.  <cit> , proposed two robertsonian fusions; one between european ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> and another between european ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  however, these suggested chromosomal rearrangements do not fully explain the major karyotype and the difference in size and c-banding pattern of the largest metacentric chromosome.

recently a customized european atlantic salmon snp-array has been developed and used to construct a dense linkage map for european salmon  <cit> . the genetic map contains  <dig>  snps positioned on  <dig> linkage groups, which agrees well with the expected number of chromosome pairs in the european karyotype  <cit> . in this study we have used an improved version of the same snp-array to construct a genetic linkage map of atlantic salmon from north america. the map was built using genotyping data from two distinct populations of north atlantic origin and positioned markers on  <dig> linkage groups. as similar snp-arrays in both studies enabled positioning of markers on both maps, the linkage map data could be used to predict the major chromosomal rearrangements between atlantic salmon from either side of the atlantic ocean. in addition, fish analysis was performed to test the proposed karyotype differences.

RESULTS
linkage map construction in north american atlantic salmon
female and male genetic linkage maps, consisting of  <dig>  snps covering  <dig> chromosomes, were constructed for the north american atlantic salmon . of these,  <dig>  snps have also been assigned positions within the european atlantic salmon linkage map  <cit>  with the remaining  <dig> snps being north american specific. the total lengths of the female and male linkage maps were  <dig>  cm and 968 cm, respectively. while females showed a relatively even distribution of recombination along the length of each of their chromosomes, recombination was very concentrated towards telomeres in males as previously shown in european atlantic salmon  <cit>  and other salmonids  <cit> . synteny and marker order within chromosomal regions were well conserved. therefore, markers not separated by recombination in the current study were ordered according to the european atlantic salmon linkage map.

despite using similar snp-arrays, far fewer snps were integrated into the north american maps as compared to the european map . there are at least three possible reasons for this. first, the majority of the markers included on the snp-array were developed based on sequence data generated predominantly from european atlantic salmon, which could introduce ascertainment bias when the snp-array is used to genotype salmon of north american origin. second, the majority of the mapping families were from an aquaculture stock that was imported to new south wales from the river phillip in nova scotia in the 1960s and subsequently introduced to tasmania in the 1980s  <cit> . since this stock was created from a limited base population, and has been kept isolated for more than 30 years, a founder effect may have caused reduced variability in these mapping families  <cit> . third, the remaining mapping families came from an aquaculture program that is based on saint john river atlantic salmon, and the founders of this farmed population may also have experienced a founder effect.

chromosomal rearrangements between european and north american atlantic salmon
the linkage maps constructed for european and north american atlantic salmon have  <dig>  snps in common, which allowed us to perform a comprehensive comparison of chromosomal structures between atlantic salmon from either side of the atlantic ocean. this comparison suggests the creation of three composite chromosomes, including a novel metacentric chromosome, in north american atlantic salmon differing from the european karyotype . additional evidence for the proposed chromosomal rearrangements is provided by cytogenetic studies and fish analyses in atlantic salmon of european and north american origin . although it is likely that the north american and european karyotypes have differentiated in parallel and that one population is not the origin of the other, for the purposes of clarity, the following paragraphs use the european karyotype as the basis with which to explain differences as this is the karyotype with the higher nf.

the first proposed rearrangement involves the european chromosomes ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  we suggest that a chromosomal translocation event joined the p-arm of ssa <dig> to ssa <dig> , leaving behind a new acrocentric chromosome of the ssa01q-arm in the north american atlantic salmon . taking into account the order of markers and the increased recombination towards the end in male map, we conclude that this is a centromere to centromere fusion. this is also supported by the fish results. figure  <dig> shows a triple fish experiment where two red probes from opposite ends of ssa <dig> are detected on the same metacentric chromosome in the european sample, but separated on both acrocentric and metacentric chromosomes in the north american salmon. at the same time, a green probe for ssa <dig> alone, hybridizes to a single set of acrocentric chromosome pairs in the european sample, but is found together with one of the metacentric red probes in the north american sample. as other cytogenetic studies of north american salmon have mentioned variable numbers of the large metacentric chromosome, this could suggest that spontaneous fission or other mechanisms to stabilize meiosis in hybrids occur. we propose that the two ssa <dig> derived chromosomes in north atlantic salmon are named ssa01q and ssa01p/ <dig> according to their origin in european atlantic salmon. this chromosomal translocation does not introduce alterations in the nf or 2n, but it presents an explanation for the observed difference in size between the first chromosome  in meiotic preparations of the two atlantic salmon karyotypes shown in  <cit> .

the second proposed major rearrangement involves the small acrocentric european chromosomes ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  which in north american salmon appear to have fused in a centromere-to-centromere direction . this finding is supported by an increased recombination at the ends of the chromosome in the north american atlantic salmon male linkage map and fish results. as shown in figure  <dig>  ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> specific probes hybridize to different chromosomes in the european sample; however, north american atlantic salmon are polymorphic for this fusion, and figure  <dig> shows the karyotype of a heterozygote, as the probes are detected together on one chromosome pair  and separately on two others. we named this composite chromosome found in north american salmon ssa26/ <dig> to reflect its relationship to the european atlantic salmon chromosomes  <cit> . the formation of the metacentric ssa26/ <dig> reduces the number of acrocentric chromosomes by two relative to the european atlantic salmon, and introduces a new metacentric chromosome while the number of chromosome arms remains unaltered.

the third proposed rearrangement involves the european chromosomes ssa <dig>  and ssa <dig> . although linkage results are conclusive regarding fusion of these two chromosomes in north american atlantic salmon, it is not easy to deduce the architecture of this chromosome. we hypothesise that ssa <dig> combined through a tandem fusion with the q-arm of ssa <dig>  preserving the centromere position of ssa <dig> . this is supported by fish analysis as seen in figure  <dig>  it is proposed that the presence of rdna at or close to the breakage site can stabilize chromosomes that have undergone fission  <cit> . as can be seen from the fish imaging, the heterochromatin staining of rdna genes was present in both the european fish and the north american. it is thus not likely that the rdna genes on the short p-arm of european atlantic salmon ssa <dig>  <cit>  is translocated to another chromosome. we conclude that the north american ssa08/ <dig> is a metacentric chromosome named according to its origin in the european atlantic salmon linkage map and that the tandem fusion reduces the nf by two from  <dig> in european atlantic salmon to the documented  <dig> in north american atlantic salmon  <cit> .

the proposed chromosomal rearrangements in the north american atlantic salmon relative to the european atlantic salmon described above provide an explanation for the reported differences in karyotype between the two sub-species. however, our results from fish-analysis also indicated a heterogeneous state of the two fusion chromosomes, suggesting that there are polymorphic variations in the north american karyotype that need to be studied in more detail.

lubieniecki et al.  <cit>  represents the first to attempt to explain the chromosomal rearrangements in european and north american atlantic salmon by comparative linkage mapping using a map comprising  <dig> microsatellite markers in a single, relatively small family  of the saint john river strain. the authors describe a fusion of ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  which is supported by our analysis. however, their suggestion of a fusion between ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  is only weakly supported by their data, and was not found in our linkage data. moreover, fish analysis provided no indication that their putative ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> fusion exists in atlantic salmon of north american origin . the predicted fusions of lubieniecki et al. <cit>  came from the male map, and it is important to note that these were not seen in the female map. in addition, they did not detect the translocation between ssa01p and ssa <dig>  but as the authors note, their family has relatively limited mapping power and their ssa <dig> comprise three linkage groups  in the female map. one of these corresponds to ssa01p, whereas the other two correspond to segments of ssa01q, which has previously been shown to be equivalent to two chromosome arms of rainbow trout  <cit> . therefore, their results are not in disagreement with what is reported here; rather, their study reveals the limitations of basing conclusions on linkage maps derived from a single family and containing a relatively small number of genetic markers. evidently, the much larger dataset in the present study, which involved thousands of snps and a large population of families and offspring, enabled more reliable predictions of chromosomal rearrangements. the fact that our suggested rearrangements were validated by fish analyses provides significant confidence for these predictions.

the atlantic salmon genome seems to be remarkable in its tolerance to chromosomal rearrangements and plasticity. the ability of two individuals with different numbers of chromosomes to mate successfully may relate to the presence of pseudolinkage and residual tetrasomy in male salmonids  <cit>  that may somehow help to prevent aneuploidy in the juveniles. eggs and juveniles from the f <dig> and f <dig> generations of a cross made using one grandparent of each subspecies had high survival rates  <cit> . while our work describes the most common chromosome architecture of european and north american atlantic salmon, the analysis utilized material collected from specific breeding programs and the results may not be universally representative of north american atlantic salmon. indeed, several other karyotypes have been reported for atlantic salmon from maine and canada. for example, roberts  <cit>  reported a 2n of  <dig> or  <dig> in landlocked salmon from maine, while nygren  <cit>  reported that salmon from baie de chaleur  have a 2n of  <dig>  similar to salmon from sweden. boothroyd  <cit>  surveyed chromosomes from three river populations  and reported a 2n of  <dig> for all. however it is not always clear whether these differences are true karyotypes or artifacts attributed to  the different tissues used for analysis  <cit> , or  due to the fact that many sampled fish were hatchery culls already displaying deviant phenotypes  <cit> . preparations of chromosomes for the fish-analysis in this study, revealed heterozygosity of the fusions  in different individuals, but all north american atlantic salmon were homozygous for the ssa01p/ <dig> translocation. these observations could explain the many differing reports on the north american atlantic salmon karyotype. it would be interesting to conduct a survey of the karyotypes in different population of atlantic salmon from north america, in particular documenting the distribution of the chromosomal rearrangements described in this report.

CONCLUSIONS
our comparison of the dense snp linkage maps for atlantic salmon derived from either side of the atlantic ocean identified major chromosomal differences between european and north american atlantic salmon, which were confirmed by fish analysis. despite this, marker order is well conserved and a large proportion of the snps generated from european atlantic salmon work are informative in the north american population. thus, while gross structural differences are significant, the dna sequence at the fine-resolution scale is remarkably conserved. this is a good indication that information from the international cooperation to sequence the atlantic salmon genome  <cit> , which is utilizing a european atlantic salmon, can be transferred to salmon derived from the other side of the atlantic ocean.
