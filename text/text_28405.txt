BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease  is a highly contagious viral disease affecting a wide range of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals  <cit> . it is known to cause substantial economic losses, directly from the effect of the virus on animal health and indirectly through control efforts including quarantines and trade restrictions  <cit> .

the disease is caused by infection with a single stranded, positive sense, rna virus  belonging to the genus aphthovirus within the family picornaviridae. this virus occurs in seven distinct serotypes namely: o, a, c, asia  <dig>  sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  each having multiple strains  <cit> . all serotypes, except asia  <dig>  have been reported in eastern africa, however, serotype c was last detected in kenya in  <dig> and may be extinct  <cit> . serotypes o and a are considered endemic in most parts of africa, while the three sat serotypes have usually been restricted to sub-saharan africa  <cit> , where they are commonly diagnosed . however, incursions of sat  <dig> into the middle east , and sat  <dig> into saudi arabia , libya  and more recently into egypt and libya  have been reported  <cit> .

the maintenance of the three fmdv sat serotypes in cattle in southern and eastern africa has been associated with contact with wildlife, especially african buffalo   <cit> . fmdv has been demonstrated to persist in individual buffalo for up to 4– <dig> years and in isolated buffalo herds for up to 24 years  <cit> . in southern africa, it has, in some cases, been concluded that buffalo have been the source of fmdv infections in cattle and impala   <cit> . as a result, fmd control policies in southern africa are centred on isolating the buffalo, in the national parks and game reserves, away from the surrounding livestock populations, and vaccinating cattle kept in buffer zones around these areas against the fmdv serotypes that are carried by the nearby buffalo  <cit> .

in eastern africa, fmd was first reported in cattle in  <dig>  <cit>  and since then, the marketability of livestock and animal products within, and outside, the region has been negatively affected  <cit> . the maintenance of fmdv in the region has been attributed to various factors including: the presence of numerous wildlife reservoirs , communal and pastoral grazing systems that enable contact between livestock and wildlife  <cit> , poor diagnostic capacity in the region  <cit> , emergence of new strains , transboundary animal movements and traditional cultural practices such as the exchange of live animals for dowry and gifts  <cit> . east african countries have tried to control the disease mainly by quarantine and post outbreak vaccination. however, these measures have been difficult to enforce and suboptimal use of vaccines  <cit>  has resulted in large parts of the fmdv susceptible animal populations remaining at risk  <cit> . recently, the countries in this region have established a network to combine their control efforts to move towards freedom from fmd by  <dig> following the progressive control pathway  for fmd as described  <cit> . the pcp defines six steps in the process of achieving freedom from fmd including effective monitoring of circulating serotypes, vaccination and improved biosecurity measures  <cit> ; this strategy has been adopted by all countries in the region, including uganda  <cit> .

in uganda, sat  <dig> fmdv was first reported in  <dig>  and since then, fmd outbreaks caused by serotypes o, a, sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  have been regularly reported in livestock. in addition, for the first time, serotype sat  <dig> fmdv has been recently isolated from a clinically healthy long horned ankole calf shortly after its introduction into the area close to the queen elizabeth national park   <cit> . ugandan buffalo are only infrequently sampled for fmdv, and thus the virus has only been isolated from them during two studies in qenp; these yielded serotypes sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit>  and sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in a post-outbreak study conducted on adult cattle and goats in the same area, concurrently with the  <dig> buffalo sampling, only serotype o fmdv was isolated. furthermore,  <dig> herds of cattle had animals with higher antibody titres against serotype o than against the sat serotypes, while only one had convincing serological evidence of infection with sat fmdv  <cit> . thus, although wildlife within the ugandan national parks are often blamed for being the source of fmd outbreaks in their surroundings  <cit> , this could not be proven for the major  <dig> fmd outbreak in the qenp area  <cit> . moreover, although it is clear that fmdv can pass from buffalo to cattle  <cit> , recent attempts in uganda and kenya to establish the role of the african buffalo in the epidemiology of fmd in domestic species in eastern africa have so far not settled this  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to assess the presence of fmdv in young, unvaccinated cattle grazing in close proximity to african buffalo in the qenp  and to establish whether these buffalo play a major role in the maintenance of fmd in livestock around the national park.fig.  <dig> map of the study area: queen elizabeth national park  and its surroundings. generated using qgis, version  <dig> .1



methods
this study was designed in compliance with reflect guidelines and was approved by the ugandan ministry of agriculture, animal industries and fisheries   and makerere university  “school higher degrees and research committee”. the sampling was carried out by maaifs national animal disease diagnostics and epidemiology centre  in collaboration with kasese district veterinary office in accordance to the guidelines from maaif. the study included meetings for the herd owners where the purpose of the project was described and informed consent to the sampling, and to participation in the questionnaire survey, was obtained from the individual herd owners.

sampling approach
a cross-sectional study was conducted in katwe kabatooro and nyakatonzi subcounties of kasese district in uganda  during august-september  <dig> to assess the presence of fmdv and antibodies against this virus. the sampled herds were usually grazed communally close to  the qenp, where the animals, according to the herd owners, regularly moved/grazed/drank within 2– <dig> m of wildlife. fmd was last reported from this area in 2006– <dig>  and no vaccinations against fmdv had been carried out in this area since  <dig> 

the two sampled subcounties had an estimated cattle population of  <dig>  head of cattle distributed in approximately  <dig> herds . moreover, it was estimated that approximately 1/ <dig> of these, i.e.  <dig> , were unvaccinated 6-24-month-old cattle. a sample size of  <dig> was calculated using win episcope  <dig>  software  <cit>  at a 5 % precision level and 95 % confidence level and assuming antibody prevalence of approximately 12 %  <cit> .

at the sampling, both unstabilised blood and oropharyngeal fluid  samples were collected from each of  <dig> heads of 6-24-month-old cattle. the cattle belonged to  <dig> settled pastoralists, who in total owned  <dig> cattle within this age-cohort, and in each herd, sampled animals were randomly selected. due to the field conditions, the calculated number of samples was not entirely met; however, the number of cattle in the sampled age-group in the  <dig> sampled herds was also lower than estimated , so this was evaluated as adequate.

the op samples were immediately divided into two aliquots: one placed in phosphate buffered saline  and another in rlt buffer  and kept in liquid nitrogen until stored at − <dig> °c in the laboratory, while serum was extracted in the field and kept on ice until stored at − <dig> °c in the laboratory.

information on: vaccination history, laboratory confirmed fmd outbreaks, unreported observation of clinical symptoms of fmd, farming characteristics, history of contact between cattle and wildlife, age group mostly affected in the event of fmd outbreaks and fmd control methods was collected from the herd owners using a semi-structured questionnaire .

serology
sera were screened for the presence of antibodies against fmdv nsps using priocheck® fmdv ns elisa test kits  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. positive samples were tested  for antibodies against the seven different fmdv serotypes using solid phase blocking elisas   <cit> . results were read as the optical density  of wells with test samples and expressed as a percentage of the mean optical density  of four wells with a known negative control serum. sera were considered positive, if the odp was < 50 % for serotypes o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  < 45 % for serotype a, and < 35 % for serotypes c and asia  <dig>  due to expected cross-reactions, all sera giving positive reactions in the initial screening were titrated in two-fold dilution series from 1/ <dig> to 1/ <dig> and titres expressed as the reciprocal of the highest positive dilution  <cit> . nineteen samples with titres ≥  <dig> in the spbes were tested in the relevant virus neutralization tests  as described in the oie manual  <cit> , while twelve sera with spbe titres ≤  <dig> were not tested further. fmdv strains used for vnt comprised o manisa, a iraq 24/ <dig>  c noville, asia  <dig> shamir, sat  <dig> bot/ <dig>  sat  <dig> zim 5/ <dig> and sat  <dig> zim 4/81; vnt titres ≥  <dig> were considered positive, titres of 15– <dig> inconclusive and titres ≤  <dig> negative.

detection of fmdv rna and isolation of fmdv from ops
thirty two op samples collected from the animals with antibodies against fmdv nsp were initially screened for fmdv rna using the 5'-untranslated region  targeted quantitative reverse transcription pcr   <cit>  and  <dig> of these with threshold cycle values  ≤  <dig> were inoculated onto primary bovine thyroid cells  and propagated through two cell culture passages  <cit> . cultures with cytopathic effect  were harvested and stored at − <dig> °c. the 3d coding region targeted rt-qpcr assay was then performed on rna extracted from the cell harvests as described previously  <cit>  and samples with ct <  <dig> were interpreted as fmdv rna positive while ct values ≥  <dig> were considered negative  <cit> . the presence of fmdv in cpe-positive harvests was analysed using an in-house antigen elisa, which also determined the serotype of positive isolates as previously described  <cit> .

sequencing of vp <dig> coding region from fmdv isolates
rna was extracted from fmdv antigen positive cell culture harvests as described above, and cdna synthesized using ready-to-go you-prime first-strand beads  with random hexamer primers 6)  <cit> . the cdna was diluted to 150 μl from which an aliquot was used for vp <dig> coding region amplification as follows: 5 μl 10x pcr buffer, 4 μl 25 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μl dh2o,  <dig>  μl amplitaq gold® dna polymerase ,  <dig>  μl 10 mm dntps,  <dig>  μl of each of forward  and reverse ; s = ; w = ; m =  and r =   <cit> , with 5 μl of cdna  <cit> .

the pcr was run in a thermocycler  using the touchdown technique as described  <cit> . the pcr products  were purified using qiaquick® gel extraction and purification kit , and quantified using a nanodrop® <dig> spectrophotometer . sequencing of the pcr products was performed using a bigdye® terminator v  <dig>  cycle sequencing kit , using the same primers as used in the pcrs, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and ran on an automated dna sequencer .

sequence assembly and analysis
nucleotide sequences were assembled and edited using seqman pro™ software . the resulting consensus sequences were compared to others using the basic local alignment search tool  in mega  <dig> . they were then aligned with  <dig> other published nucleotide sequences obtained from genbank  in muscle incorporated in mega software version  <dig> , and trimmed to correspond to the 657 nt encompassing the complete vp <dig> coding region. phylogenetic trees were estimated using the neighbor joining  method  <cit> , with  <dig> bootstrap replicate samplings and used to determine the topotype clusters for the aligned sequences. the amino acid sequences were deduced from the nucleotide sequences using the standard genetic code and the extent of amino acid relatedness in the vp <dig> coding regions determined using the same program in mega  <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> sat  <dig> vp <dig> coding sequences included in this study

RESULTS
clinical signs of fmd were not observed in any of the sampled animals or herds.

screening of the  <dig> anti-nsp antibody positive samples in spbes resulted in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples being scored positive for antibodies against serotypes o, a, c, asia  <dig>  sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  respectively, while  <dig> anti-nsp positive samples were negative in all spbes . when titrated, the few sera that were identified as positive for antibodies against serotypes a and c in the initial screening  had titres ≤  <dig> and so were considered negative. in contrast, titres ≥  <dig> were found in 5/ <dig>  6/ <dig>  4/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> of the samples titrated for antibodies against serotypes o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  respectively . in summary, the positive results were obtained from  <dig> sera collected from  <dig> different herds. six of these sera had high antibody titres against one single serotype , whereas five sera had high antibody titres against more than one of the serotypes o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> .

neutralising antibodies  were only detected against serotype o and only in three animals, while eight, six, five and six sera had inconclusive neutralizing antibody titres against o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> or sat  <dig>  respectively, and all the other tested sera were negative . the three vnt positive animals had spbe antibody titres ≥  <dig> and came from three different herds .

diagnostic rt-qpcrs, virus isolation and antigen elisa
in the 5´utr rt-qpcr assay,  <dig> out of the  <dig> tested op samples generated ct values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  of which only three samples had ct < <dig> . ten of these  <dig> op samples produced cpe when inoculated onto primary btycells but only two cell culture harvests  were found positive in the 3d rt-qpcr assay  and these had ct values of  <dig> and  <dig> . moreover, only the same two virus harvests were found positive for fmdv antigen in fmdv antigen elisas and were identified as serotype sat  <dig> . these two virus harvests were generated from the op samples with the lowest ct values in the 5´utr rt-qpcr assay, and were both collected from herd h <dig>  rna extracted from cell harvests derived from one op from each of herds h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> each had a ct value  <dig> in the 3d rt-qpcr, which is on the borderline of confidence in detection  <cit> , but no fmdv could be isolated.

herd diagnosis
there was no evidence of exposure to fmdv in ten of the  <dig> herds in this study  , while four herds had antibodies against fmdv nsps only, either in one animal  or in five animals  . another four herds had anti-nsp antibody seroprevalences of 17–33 %  with antibodies against one or more serotypes in 1– <dig> of these animals . six herds had more substantial evidence for exposure to fmdv. this was in the form of higher seroprevalences  of antibodies against fmdv nsps , spbe antibody titres ≥  <dig> in more than one animal , neutralising antibodies in one animal  and isolation of fmdv from ops .

characterisation of fmdv isolates
sequencing revealed that the two  <dig> nucleotide  long regions, from the 731 bp amplicons, corresponding to the vp <dig> coding sequences of uga/116/ <dig> and uga/161/ <dig> were identical. alignment of these complete vp <dig> sequences with  <dig> other african fmdv isolates  showed that they belonged to the sat  <dig> topotype iv  , clustered together with three previous ugandan buffalo isolates of  <dig> and  <dig>  and also the uga/7/ <dig> isolate whose species of origin was not identified . the vp <dig> sequences of the  <dig> isolates had 21 %, 20 % and 24 % nucleotide  difference from these earlier buffalo isolate vp <dig> sequences, respectively, while their relationship with another ugandan buffalo isolate from  <dig>  and an earlier ugandan sat  <dig> cattle isolate  was even more distant . however, except for the uga/13/ <dig> strain  and uga/1/ <dig> , the various ugandan isolates represent independent lineages within topotype iv  . the sat  <dig> vaccine strain  used in uganda belongs to a different topotype i  and differs from the sat  <dig> vp <dig> sequences obtained from this study by 26 % and 21 % at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively.fig.  <dig> a neighbor-joining tree showing the relationships between the vp <dig> coding sequences  of the two ugandan sat  <dig> isolates from this study ) and sat  <dig> fmdv vp <dig> coding sequences from uganda , kenya , tanzania , ethiopia , nigeria  and kruger national park  in south africa as obtained from genbank . topotypes are indicated according to tekleghiorghis et al.   <cit> . bootstrap values are indicated. scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site



since the vp <dig> sequences of the two isolates from h <dig> were identical, the  <dig> aligned sat  <dig> vp <dig> coding sequences  encoded  <dig> different amino acid sequences, each with  <dig> amino acid residues , which were conserved at  <dig>  % of the sites. multiple amino acid substitutions were observed within the known hypervariable regions  <cit> . in the g-h loop, compared to the vaccine strain , residues  <dig> and 149– <dig>  remained conserved in all the  <dig> sequences, while multiple substitutions occurred in the section including residues 138– <dig> which is known to be a key antigenic region in fmdvs  <cit> . the seven ugandan isolates were conserved at residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with each having a distinct amino acid  substitution at positions 140– <dig>  uga/116/ <dig> showed full aa conservation with uga/7/ <dig>  uga/1/ <dig>  uga/13/ <dig> and uga/21/ <dig> at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while the uga/1/ <dig> and uga 10/ <dig> strains had different substitutions . uga/116/ <dig> had multiple substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> compared to the vaccine strain  and distinct substitutions in these positions were also observed in the other ugandan isolates but without a pattern. in the h-i loop , all the  <dig> sequences were fully conserved at positions  <dig>   <dig> and 181– <dig>  however, there were distinct substitutions among the ugandan isolates within this region. near the c-terminus , five positions  were conserved in all the  <dig> isolates, while the ugandan isolates also showed full conservation at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> plus almost complete conservation at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the uga/116/ <dig> differed from the other  <dig> strains by having substitutions outside the g-h loop , the h-i loop  and the c-terminus  .fig.  <dig> the sequence alignment for the vp <dig> protein of  <dig> sat  <dig> fmd viruses. dots indicate amino acid residues identical to the reference sequence sat  <dig> tan/155/71



herd owner replies to semi-structured questionnaires
according to the responses to questionnaires , 96 % of the herd owners grazed their herds communally inside qenp and 63 % frequently observed close contact with buffalo, especially during the dry season. moreover, 75 % of the farmers reported that buffalo and other wildlife grazed around the cattle kraals during the night. most farmers were aware of fmd outbreaks in their area, 58 % had experienced clinical fmd in their herds and  <dig>  % had observed signs similar to clinical fmd  since the last documented outbreak in  <dig> . when suspected cases of fmd occurred, 63 % of the farmers reported this to the area veterinarian, 17 % drove the animals into the waters of the albertine rift valley salt lakes, 33 % applied local herbs and 4 % treated with oxy-tetracycline sprays.

discussion
at the qenp livestock-wildlife interface, young unvaccinated cattle from  <dig> herds without reports of clinical signs of fmd had an overall seroprevalence of 15 %  for antibodies against fmdv nsps. this is higher than the 5 % seroprevalence reported in cattle herds without clinical signs in the same area in  <dig>  <cit>  but compares well with the 12 % value reported in young calves in fmd-endemic ethiopia  <cit> .

evidence for prior fmdv infection varied between herds, thus evidence for exposure to fmdv was absent in ten herds, scanty in eight herds and more substantial in six herds . the observed scattered presence of antibodies does not appear to fit well with the general appreciation of the epidemiology of fmd as an efficiently spreading disease with high morbidity in affected herds and high risk of transfer to other herds through physical contact and fomites  <cit> . moreover, although the farmers were well acquainted with clinical signs of fmd, a number of them would not report outbreaks, but rather used traditional control measures like application of local herbs or walking the animals through the salt lakes known to contain common salt and sodium bicarbonate  <cit> .

there is an undefined level of trade with cattle, including young stock for fattening, coming into the area from other districts; thus individual animals with antibodies against fmdv may be explained as animals infected elsewhere and brought into the herds as replacement stock or gifts to the owners as part of local customs  <cit> . however, the higher antibody prevalences in h <dig> and h <dig> and the isolation of sat  <dig> fmdv from ops from two cattle in h <dig> support spread within these herds ; moreover, it cannot be excluded that the infections causing antibodies in the other herds have taken place in kasese district.

another possibility is that some of the antibodies against fmdv observed in this study are residual maternally transferred antibodies. since cattle in this area are likely to have their first calf at 3– <dig> years of age and to have several calves, it is likely that some of the dams to the sampled calf cohort  were exposed to fmdv by infection and/or vaccination during the 2006– <dig> outbreak  <cit> . a fraction of these dams may have retained sufficient level of antibodies, especially against the nsps, to transfer these to their offspring. moreover, although fmd outbreaks had not been reported in the area since  <dig>  the district veterinary office noted that underreporting was suspected since quarantine restrictions due to fmd would paralyze all economic activities in the area.

although it is not clear when, or how, some of the antibody positive animals in these herds were infected, spbe assays showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> nsp positive samples had antibody titres ≥  <dig> against one or more serotypes. based on spbe and vnt results from the few positive animals, it appeared that serotype o fmdv had infected some animals from h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  while sat  <dig> fmdv had infected some animals from h <dig> and possibly h <dig>  in the latter case this was confirmed by isolation of sat  <dig> fmdv from two animals. the situation was unclear in herds h <dig> and h <dig> with high spbe antibody titres against serotypes o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  which could be due to the previously observed cross-reactivity between the spbes and also between the vnts  <cit> . moreover, if animals were purchased from other districts, vaccine-derived antibodies cannot be excluded either. in accordance with previous findings in the area  <cit> , there was no conclusive serological evidence for previous infection by serotypes a, c, asia  <dig> and sat  <dig> in the sampled cattle, although very recently sat  <dig> fmdv was isolated from an asymptomatic calf from the area  <cit> .

the sat  <dig> fmdv isolates obtained from the two healthy animals in h <dig> are the first reported sat  <dig> isolates from ugandan cattle since  <dig>  <cit> , while sat  <dig> isolates have been obtained from buffalo in qenp in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the relatively infrequent isolation of sat  <dig> fmdv from outbreaks in ugandan cattle could be the result of poor surveillance in the form of underreporting of fmd outbreaks and limited submission of samples of sufficient quality for virus isolation to the central diagnostic laboratory at the national animal disease diagnostics and epidemiology centre  . moreover, there have been limited options for typing fmdv locally in uganda  <cit> .

the combination of rather low ct values  in the 5'utr tests for the two h <dig> op samples that yielded the sat  <dig> fmdv isolates and spbe antibody titres of  <dig> and  <dig> for antibodies against sat  <dig> fmdv in sera from the same animals, indicate that these two animals were in the subacute stage of the infection. however, no clinical signs were observed during the sampling and there were no reports of clinical signs in this or in other cattle herds in the area. moreover, the questionnaire responses indicated that the indigenous ankole cattle from this area have less severe clinical signs of fmd than the pure exotic and crossbred cattle. hence, these data support the notion that some of the ugandan indigenous long-horned ankole cattle may go through fmdv infection with only minimal clinical signs of fmd. this is consistent with the very recent isolation of sat  <dig> fmdv from an op sample from a clinically healthy young calf in the qenp area  <cit>  and has been previously reported for indigenous cattle in botswana  <cit> . if true, this notion has a bearing on the passive surveillance reporting system for fmd in uganda that is based on clinical observations.

this study shows a considerable genetic difference between the current ugandan sat  <dig> cattle virus and the vaccine strain  that is currently used to control fmd outbreaks caused by sat  <dig> fmdv in uganda, indeed these belong to different topotypes. thus, vaccine matching studies using the currently circulating sat  <dig> strain are required. in addition, the observed differences from earlier buffalo and cattle isolates imply that different sat  <dig> lineages have been in circulation in this area over the last 50 years. to verify this, more ugandan fmdv sat  <dig> isolates should be collected and characterised.

despite the close interaction that occurs between cattle and buffalo at the qenp livestock-wildlife-interface, this study did not provide evidence to support the view that the fmd viruses circulating in cattle in this area originate from wildlife as has been observed in south africa  <cit> . this could be attributed to the limited numbers of isolates from cattle and the long time-intervals between their isolations; but it also does not exclude the possibility that separate pools of viruses circulate in cattle and wildlife. the vp <dig> coding sequences of five of the six ugandan sat  <dig> isolates were different from those of isolates from other countries, indicating that the ugandan sat  <dig> strains may be geographically limited to uganda as previously suggested  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although fmd was last reported in kasese district in  <dig>  evidence of infection with fmdv was found in six of  <dig> cattle herds from the qenp livestock-wildlife-interface. the sat  <dig> fmdv isolated from one of these six herds was markedly different from the earlier buffalo isolates from the same area; thus transmission between buffalo and cattle could not be proven. the genetic difference  between the current sat  <dig> isolates and the vaccine strain used to control fmd outbreaks in the country calls for vaccine matching to ensure the effectiveness of vaccination in this region. additional surveillance and characterization of field strains from cattle and buffalo at this livestock-wildlife interface is necessary for monitoring of emerging strains and to enhance the understanding of the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of fmd in cattle in east africa.
