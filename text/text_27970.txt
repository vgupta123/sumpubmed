BACKGROUND
bcl- <dig> family proteins are central to the regulation of mitochondrial integrity and cell death pathways that converge on this organelle  <cit> . this family comprises both pro-survival  and pro-apoptotic  proteins. all members of this family are characterized by the presence of bh  domain  <cit> . bax is a multidomain pro-apoptotic member of the bcl- <dig> family, characterized by the presence of bh 1– <dig> domains. the bh <dig> domain regulates bax homodimerization as well as heterodimerization with bcl-2/bcl-xl <cit> , such that the bax-bh <dig> domain docks into the hydrophobic groove formed by bh <dig>  bh <dig> and bh <dig> domains of the anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit> . selectivity in interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family has been reported  <cit> .

changes in bax conformation and localization are characteristic of many cells undergoing apoptosis  <cit> . in dying cells a conformationally distinct form of  bax accumulates at the mitochondrial outer membrane triggering the release of apoptogenic intermediates sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space  <cit> . several studies have yielded insights on the molecular mechanisms regulating bax activation  <cit>  and the n-terminus is implicated in this function. controlled cleavage of the bax n-terminus by calpain, a ca2+-dependent cysteine protease generates a dominantly active form of bax  <cit> . short forms of bax deleted of the first  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids are highly cytotoxic, largely associated with mitochondrial membrane and poorly inhibited by ectopically expressed bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl  <cit> . two splice variants bax ψ and bax κ lack  <dig> amino acids present at the n-terminal of bax-α and are potent inducers of cytotoxicity when ectopically expressed in cells  <cit> .

specific regions in the n and c terminus are implicated in the regulated mitochondrial targeting of bax  <cit> . however, recombinant bax protein lacking these regions retains mitochondrial targeting and insertion capabilities  <cit>  because of two putative transmembrane  regions, one encompassing the α5–α <dig> helices  and the second the α <dig> helix  at the c-terminus  <cit> . these are referred to as tm <dig> and tm <dig> respectively in this study. recent experiments have shown that both tm <dig> and tm <dig> span the lipid bilayer in the membrane fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis  <cit> . additionally other reports have identified a role for the α5–α <dig> helices in mitochondrial membrane insertion and cytochrome c release  <cit> . in the present study the tm <dig> domain and n-terminus have been characterized in the context of regulation of activity by bcl-xl. specifically, the experiments suggest that interactions between the n-terminus and tm <dig> region in intact bax, modulate susceptibility to inhibition by bcl-xl.

RESULTS
apoptosis triggered by a bax n-terminal deletion mutant  is poorly inhibited by the anti apoptotic proteins, bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl
apoptosis triggered by a deletion mutant that lacks the first  <dig> amino acids  was poorly inhibited by bcl-xl  or bcl- <dig>  in the jurkat t-cell line. since bcl- <dig> or bcl-xl function may be modulated by other pro-apoptotic proteins present in mammalian cells, we turned to the heterologous system of drosophila melanogaster, which expresses only one pro- and one anti-apoptotic protein of the bcl- <dig> family  <cit> . we hypothesized that by expressing these proteins in  drosophila, modulation by an endogenous modifier   will be independent of the construct being tested and will be equivalent  in all conditions.

bax-gfp, bax 30–192-gfp and bcl- <dig> were cloned into the puast vector and expression of the tagged proteins at the appropriate molecular weights confirmed in the drosophila s <dig> cell line . transgenic fly lines of bax, bax 30– <dig> and bcl- <dig> were generated by independent p-element transformation of the uas-bax-gfp , uas-bax30–192-gfp  and uas-bcl- <dig>  constructs. using the uas-gal <dig> system both bax and bax 30– <dig> were lethal to flies when driven in various tissues while bcl- <dig> expression alone was not lethal . this allowed us to test for the rescue of lethality by bcl- <dig> 

uas transgenic lines for bax-gfp  or bax 30–192-gfp  or bcl- <dig>  were screened for lethality using various tissue specific gal <dig> lines as indicated. percent viability was calculated by assessing the number of bax-gfp or bax 30–192-gfp or bcl- <dig> expressing flies compared to the appropriate sibling control that eclosed at 25°c. numbers in parenthesis indicate animals screened for analysis.

for these experiments, vg-gal <dig> and twist-gal <dig> lines were used to drive expression largely in the dorsal margins of wings and mesoderm respectively. when driven along with bax  using vg-gal <dig>  or twist-gal <dig>  bcl- <dig> rescued bax induced lethality whereas bax 30– <dig>  induced lethality was only marginally rescued. flies expressing bax or bax 30– <dig>  present deformity in wings to various degrees . all the flies that emerged for bax  and bax 30– <dig>  presented a strong wing defect . bcl- <dig> co expression with bax in the double transgenic fly line ba64iii, bc57i resulted in complete rescue of the wing defect  while there was no change in the severe wing defect in bax 30– <dig> and bcl- <dig>  expressing flies . additional transgenic fly lines of uas-bax , uas-bax 30– <dig> and uas-bcl- <dig>  were tested for viability and wing defect using vg-gal <dig> with similar results . thus, the experiments using the heterologous model system of drosophila melanogaster recapitulated the observation of inefficient inhibition of bax 30– <dig> by anti-apoptotic proteins in mammalian cells.

additional uas transgenic lines for bax-gfp  or bax 30–192-gfp  or bax-gfp+bcl- <dig>  or bax 30–192-gfp+bcl- <dig>  driven by vg-gal <dig> were assessed for the viability of flies at 25°c as described in figure 2b. the eclosed adult flies expressing bax-gfp or bax 30–192-gfp were analyzed for the extent of wing defect and categorized as depicted in figure 2i. the percentage of flies for the wing defect was calculated with respect to the total number of eclosed flies expressing bax-gfp or bax 30–192-gfp. numbers in parenthesis indicate flies screened for analysis.

apoptosis triggered by transmembrane - <dig>  deletion mutants is inhibited by bcl-xl
to assess the contributions of the tm domains in bax 30– <dig> cytotoxicity, additional regions were deleted . apoptosis triggered by a mutant devoid of the c-terminal tm <dig> domain  is bcl- <dig> independent, whereas apoptosis triggered by bax 1– <dig> is inhibited . however, it should be noted that apoptosis triggered by this construct was considerably lower than that triggered by full-length bax thereby confounding interpretation of the data. bax 30– <dig> which lacks any putative or experimentally proven tm domain but retains the bh <dig> domain triggered high levels of apoptotic damage, which was blocked by bcl-xl or bcl- <dig> .

we then tested the deletion mutants for regulation by bcl-xl in the hek cell line as the larger size and adherent nature of the cells facilitates assessment of apoptotic damage and subcellular distribution of gfp-tagged proteins. bax induced apoptosis was effectively blocked by bcl-xl; apoptosis triggered by bax 30– <dig> was poorly inhibited, and apoptosis triggered by bax 30– <dig> was blocked by ectopically expressed bcl-xl in this cell line . jurkat cells express lower levels of bax protein compared to the hek cell line arguing against interactions with endogenous bax accounting for the responses of the deletion mutants.

bcl-xl regulation of bax 30– <dig> and bax 30– <dig> colocalization with bid and bim
the first alpha helix  in the bax n-terminus is implicated in interactions with activator bh3-only proteins  <cit> . in apoptotic cells, bax clusters co-localized with bid or bim . in cells expressing bcl-xl, bid and bim are evenly distributed and do not overlap bax-gfp . bax 30–192-gfp tends to coalesce into a large cluster and overlaps with regions of intense staining with bid or bim . however, there is no change in the largely punctate distribution of bax 30– <dig> or the overlap with bid or bim in cells co-expressing bcl-xl .

since bax 30– <dig> triggered bcl-xl dependent apoptosis although it did not localize to mitochondria , we asked if it triggered the activation of endogenous bax. changes in bax conformation consistent with its activation reveal an epitope in the n-terminus that can be detected using a specific antibody clone 6a <dig>  <cit> . bax 30– <dig> lacks the relevant section of the n-terminus, and 6a <dig> reactivity in cells expressing bax 30– <dig> indicated the activation of endogenous bax . this reactivity was lost in cells that express bax 30– <dig> and bcl-xl . further, endogenous bax as detected by the reactivity of clone 6a <dig> colocalized with bid and bim and this was regulated by bcl-xl .

in the absence of the n-terminus, the tm <dig> domain attenuates inhibition by bcl-xl but triggers caspase- <dig> dependent apoptosis
a construct that included the tm <dig> domain comprising the α5–α <dig> helices, but not the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids   triggered bcl-xl independent cytotoxicity  indicating that the tm <dig> domain interfered with the anti-apoptotic function of bcl-xl. since bax function converges on the activation of caspase- <dig>  <cit>  we analyzed apoptotic damage induced by bax, bax 30– <dig> or bax 30– <dig> when co-expressed with a construct that is a dominant-negative inhibitor of caspase- <dig>   <cit> . apoptosis triggered by all the mutants tested, including bax 30– <dig>  was blocked by the co-transfection of dnc <dig> in hek cells  and in the jurkat cell line . the data show that all the constructs tested activate a caspase- <dig> mediated apoptotic cascade as has been established for bax.

sub-cellular fractionation of hek cells  transfected with the relevant constructs showed that bax is present in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, whereas increased amounts of bax 30– <dig> was detected in the mitochondrial fractions . in many experiments, the distribution of bax 30– <dig> and bax 30– <dig> was skewed to the mitochondrial fraction . expectedly, bax 30– <dig> was consistently detected only in the cytosolic fraction. the mitochondrial matrix protein cox- <dig> was used to ascertain purity of the fractions.

bcl-xl associates with but does not regulate the localization of n-terminal deletion constructs
subsequently we assessed the cellular distribution of the constructs using gfp to report on bcl-xl regulation of bax localization. in the absence of exogenous bcl-xl, the distribution of bax, bax 30– <dig> and bax 30– <dig> is punctate in apoptotic cells whereas, bax 30– <dig> is diffuse . in cells co-transfected with bcl-xl , bax distribution is rendered diffuse  as opposed to bax 30– <dig> or bax 30– <dig>  where the punctate distribution is largely unchanged by bcl-xl . the distribution of bax 30– <dig> was not changed by bcl-xl . the distribution of bax in punctate or diffuse patterns in the presence or absence of bcl-xl is plotted in figure 6c. the values are derived from an assessment of approximately  <dig> cells in random fields in each experiment. this experiment shows that in bax constructs which lack the first  <dig> amino acids bcl-xl regulation of cellular distribution is compromised.

ectopically expressed bcl-xl immunoprecipitated cotransfected bax, bax 30– <dig> or bax 30– <dig>  indicating that association with bcl-xlis not impaired in the absence of the first twenty nine residues in bax protein.

the bax n-terminus regulates inhibition by bcl-xl
since bcl-xl poorly regulated bax 30– <dig> or 30– <dig> despite the association with the protein, we tested if the n-terminus can modulate this function. apoptosis triggered by bax 1– <dig> which includes the n-terminus and the tm <dig> domain was efficiently blocked by rfp-bcl-xl . bax 1– <dig> immunoprecipitates bcl-xl and is detected in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions . furthermore, the punctate distribution of bax 1– <dig> in apoptotic cells redistributes to a diffuse pattern in cells that co-express bcl-xl . the distribution of bax 1– <dig> overlaps significantly with that of bcl-xl . the change in distribution of bax 1– <dig> in response to co-expressed bcl-xl is shown . in a construct that lacks the tm domains, the n-terminus did not modulate bax-bh <dig> function .

phosphorylation dependent modifications that change protein conformation regulate the apoptotic function of bcl- <dig> family proteins. bax-induced apoptosis is inhibited by the serine-threonine kinase akt . this regulation was compromised in a bax construct  with alanine substitutions of the ser/thr residues  in the n-terminus which was refractory to inhibition by akt . the modification in the n-terminus however, did not interfere with bcl-xl inhibition of bax-ala <dig> induced apoptosis .

the n-terminus regulates sensitivity to inductive stimuli and inhibition by bcl-xl
the deletion mutants were tested in a cellular system where bax activity is regulated by externally applied stimuli  <cit> . in cos- <dig> cells, staurosporine  triggered the translocation of ectopically expressed bax and was a potent inducer of bax-mediated cytotoxicity, which was inhibited in cells co-expressing bcl-xl . bax 30– <dig> and bax 30– <dig> localized into puncta  or large clusters and triggered high levels of apoptotic damage which were not further enhanced by sts  or inhibited by bcl-xl . bax 1– <dig> is largely diffuse but also localizes as puncta and is a potent inducer of bcl-xl dependent cytotoxicity in response to sts . bax 30– <dig> triggered apoptosis in the absence of sts although bcl-xl inhibited apoptotic damage in the presence or absence of the apoptotic stimulus .

the data thus far suggested that apoptosis triggered by bax 30– <dig> and bax 30– <dig> should not depend on endogenous bax or bak, whereas bax 30– <dig> induced apoptosis may depend on these proteins. mef deficient for both bax and bak were therefore tested for susceptibility to apoptosis by the bax deletion mutant constructs. confirming these predictions bax and bax 30– <dig> but not bax 30– <dig> triggered apoptosis in bax/bak deficient cells .

tm <dig> helices of full-length bax are structural antagonists to bcl-xl
in an attempt to elucidate structural correlates if any, of the phenotypes presented by the mutants we turned to a sequence-based analysis of the interacting proteins. the three-dimensional structures of full-length bax sequence and deletion mutants have been obtained from homology modeling, using modeller  starting from the human protein that has 92% sequence identity. the homology model of bax was examined using the program dial  <cit> . the deletion experiments, using mutants lacking the first  <dig> residues, suggest that major structural alterations in full-length bax involving the n-terminal  <dig> residues, influence the penultimate helix connecting tm <dig> and tm <dig> regions in the three-dimensional model of full-length bax . in order to test if there is structural equivalence between the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl and regions in bax, we examined full-length bcl-xl and bax for sub-optimal sequence similarity. a high gap penalty of  <dig> was employed to align the two sets of sequences using malign  <cit> . in particular, we notice that the first helix of tm <dig>  and the second helix of tm <dig>  have significant sequence similarity with α- <dig> and α- <dig> of bcl-xl and related anti-apoptotic proteins, respectively . this is supported by previous structural studies where bcl-xl was co-crystallized with bh3-region of bim and both helices α- <dig> and α- <dig> of bcl-xl in this complex interact with the bh <dig> of bim  <cit> . this suggests that the presence of tm <dig> region could act as structural antagonists for the interaction of bcl-xl with bax. furthermore, the bh <dig> region of bcl-xl shows local sequence similarity with the penultimate bh <dig> helix in bax .

discussion
the bh <dig> domain is critical to several interactions within the bcl- <dig> family  <cit>  and the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl regulate bax via interactions involving this domain  <cit> . however, mutations in the bax-bh <dig> domain which disrupt interactions with pro-survival proteins do not always disrupt regulation by the latter  <cit> . the n-terminus of bax is implicated in the regulation of its function by bcl-2/bcl-xl and activator bh3-only proteins . here we show that the bh <dig> and tm <dig> domains are adequate for association with bcl-xl and localization to mitochondria respectively, but an intact n-terminus plays a non-redundant role in the regulation of bax cytotoxicity by bcl-xl.

in contrast to bax  <cit> , the distributions of bax 30– <dig> or bax 30– <dig> were largely unchanged by bcl-xl . the tm <dig> domain/α5–α <dig> helices  in bax bring about membrane insertion and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cell-free assays  <cit> . the substitution of charged residues in the α5–α <dig> helices of bax resulted in its constitutive localization to mitochondria, akin to gain-of-function mutants and increased binding to bcl-xl  <cit> . despite consistent differences from bax in regulation by bcl-xl, the n-terminal deletion mutants immunoprecipitated ectopically expressed bcl-xl . this is not unexpected as the association of apoptotic with anti-apoptotic proteins does not culminate in the inhibition of pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> . further, bax 30– <dig> triggered caspase- <dig> dependent apoptosis and localized with bid and bim conventionally associated with regulated activity of bax  <cit>  a distribution largely unchanged by bcl-xl. in our experiments the effect of the tm <dig> domain was mitigated by the inclusion of the n-terminal region i.e. bax-1– <dig> .

the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl are not functionally equivalent and the differences in the regulation of bax 30– <dig>  likely reflect differences in affinities of the mutant for the anti-apoptotic proteins. such differences in functional interactions between pro-survival members and the pro-apoptotic or bh <dig> only proteins  have been previously reported  <cit> . the bops are thought to be critical mediators of the activation of bax/bak although the mechanism underlying this activation is unresolved. thus, 'activator" bops  have been reported to directly bind bax and bak triggering activation of the latter and are assisted in this function by "derepressor" bop  which bind anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit> . on the other hand there is compelling evidence that bop trigger the activation of bax principally by binding bcl-2/mcl-1/bcl-xl  <cit>  obviating a requirement for direct interactions with bax/bak except in some conditions  <cit> . bax 30– <dig> fulfills several criteria associated with bh <dig> domain only proteins triggering activation of endogenous bax ; bcl-xl dependence and in the requirement for endogenous bax-bak for apoptotic function .

we do not know the mechanism underlying the lack of regulation of bax 30– <dig> and bax 30– <dig> by bcl-xl. the constitutive association of bax 30– <dig> and 30– <dig> with bcl-xl may arise from structural changes in the deletion mutants culminating in a greater affinity  for the anti-apoptotic protein. this may permit the mutants to sequester ectopically expressed bcl-xl. on the other hand the association may impose conformational changes on bcl-xl such that the latter is rendered functionally inactive and thereby unable to regulate apoptotic damage. that the pattern of bid distribution in cells expressing bax or bax 30– <dig> changes on co-expressing bcl-xl but not in cells that express bax 30– <dig> provides some support for this possibility.

analysis of local sequence similarities indicate that sub-optimal alignments reside at the interacting site of bcl-xl and bax tm <dig> helices. sub-optimal sequence alignment between tm <dig> of bax and α5–α <dig> of bcl-xl suggests that the tm <dig> might block a productive functional interaction with bcl-xl. the absence of n-terminal residues in bax leads to a dramatic effect in its regulation by bcl-xl in apoptotic function. the deletion analysis of bax suggests that the n-terminal residues that are spatially interacting with the bh <dig> helix are absolutely required for  the normal and necessary structural alterations in tm <dig> helices such that the anti-apoptotic elements can regulate its function. these are currently being investigated by detailed molecular dynamics simulations as well as studying the effect of additional mutations in bax. the tm <dig> region in bax may not be a crucial structural antagonist to bcl-xl since the removal of tm <dig> results in a mutant  whose apoptotic activity is not regulated by bcl-xl in the jurkat and the hek cell lines. thus we propose  that the n-terminal "switch" of  <dig> residues is necessary to produce the required structural alterations in bax such that tm <dig>  is displaced from the bcl-xl interacting site. in the absence of the n-terminal switch, this natural "trigger" mechanism is abolished and the tm helices continue to act as 'structural valves' where the protein remains closed to inhibition by bcl-xl-like proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments extend previous observations that the bax n-terminus is an essential component in the regulation of bax function by anti-apoptotic proteins such as bcl-xl. furthermore we propose that an intramolecular interaction between the n-terminus and the tm <dig> may be the mechanism underlying this regulation.
