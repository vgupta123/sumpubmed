BACKGROUND
the accumulation of genome-wide gene expression data has enabled biologists to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms using system biology approaches. recent developments in microarray technologies and bioinformatics have driven the progress of this field  <cit> . moreover, publicly available microarray data provide information on human genome-wide gene expression under various experimental conditions, which for most researchers would be difficult to access otherwise.

bdnf  plays an important role in the development of the vertebrates' nervous system  <cit> . bdnf supports survival and differentiation of embryonic neurons and controls various neural processes in adulthood, including memory and learning  <cit> , depression  <cit> , and drug addiction  <cit> . alterations in bdnf expression can contribute to serious pathologies such as epilepsy, huntington, alzheimer's, and parkinson's disease  <cit> . alteration in bdnf expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis in neuroblastoma  <cit> , myeloma  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and other tumors  <cit> . apart from brain, expression of alternative bdnf transcripts has been detected in a variety of tissues   <cit> . numerous studies have been conducted to unravel the regulation of bdnf expression in rodents and human. data on the structure of human  <cit>  and rodent  <cit> bdnf gene have been recently updated. nevertheless, little is known about the regulation of human bdnf gene expression in vivo. unraveling the regulation of bdnf expression remains difficult due to its multiple activity-dependent and tissue-specific promoters. thus, analysis of the gene expression under various experimental conditions using microarray data could provide insight into the regulation of this complex gene.

meta-coexpression analysis uses multiple experiments to identify more reliable sets of genes than would be found using a single data set. the rationale behind meta-coexpression analysis is that co-regulated genes should display similar expression patterns across various conditions. moreover, such analysis may benefit from a vast representation of tissues and conditions  <cit> . a yeast study showed that the ability to correctly identify co-regulated genes in co-expression analysis is strongly dependent on the number of microarray experiments used  <cit> . another study that examined  <dig> human microarray datasets for co-expressed gene pairs reports that gene ontology  score for gene pairs increases steadily with the number of confirmed links compared to the pairs confirmed by only a single dataset  <cit> . several studies have successfully applied meta-analysis approach to get important insights into various biological processes. for instance, microarray meta-analysis of aging and cellular senescence led to the observation that the expression pattern of cellular senescence was similar to that of aging in mice, but not in humans  <cit> . data from a variety of laboratories was integrated to identify a common host transcriptional response to pathogens  <cit> . also, meta-coexpression studies have displayed their efficiency to predict functional relationships between genes  <cit> . however, co-expression alone does not necessarily imply that genes are co-regulated. thus, analysis of evolutionary conservation of co-expression coupled with the search for over-represented motifs in the promoters of co-expressed genes is a powerful criterion to identify genes that are co-regulated from a set of co-expressed genes  <cit> .

in co-expression analysis, similarity of gene expression profiles is measured using correlation coefficients  or other distance measures. if the correlation between two genes is above a given threshold, then the genes can be considered as «co-expressed»  <cit> . co-expression analysis using a «guide-gene» approach involves measuring cc between pre-selected gene and the rest of the genes in a dataset.

it is a common practice in meta-coexpression studies to assess co-expression by calculating the gene pair correlations after merging the datasets  <cit>  or by confirming the re-occurrence of significant correlations across datasets  <cit> . however, it has been shown recently that genes can reveal differential co-expression patterns across subsets in the same dataset   <cit> . therefore, assessing co-expression by measuring cc across merged samples of a dataset or by merging datasets may create correlation patterns that could not be captured using the cc measurement.

in this study, we performed co-expression analysis of publicly available microarray data using bdnf as a "guide-gene". we inferred bdnf gene co-expression links that were conserved between human and rodents using a novel "subset" approach. then, we discovered new putative regulatory elements in human bdnf and in bdnf-correlated genes, and proposed potential regulators of bdnf gene expression.

RESULTS
we analyzed  <dig> subsets derived from the total of  <dig> human, mouse and rat microarray datasets. in order to avoid spurious results that could arise from high-throughput microarray analysis methods, we applied successive filtering of genes. then, we divided datasets into subsets with biologically meaningful sample content , analyzed co-expression with bdnf across samples separately in each subset and confirmed the links across subsets. finally, we analyzed conservation in co-expression between human, mouse and rat, and sought for conserved tfbss in bdnf and bdnf-correlated genes .

data filtering
gene expression omnibus  from ncbi and arrayexpress from ebi are the largest public peer reviewed microarray repositories, each containing about  <dig> experiments. in order to avoid inaccuracies arising from measuring expression correlation across different microarray platforms  <cit>  we used only affymetrix genechips platforms for the analysis. since arrayexpress imports affymetrix experiments from geo , we used only geo database to retrieve datasets.

a study examining the relationship between the number of analyzed microarray experiments and the reliability of the results reported that the accuracy of the analysis plateaus at between  <dig> and  <dig> experiments  <cit> . another study demonstrated how the large amount of microarray data can be exploited to increase the reliability of inferences about gene functions. links that were confirmed three or more times between different experiments had significantly higher go term overlaps than those seen only once or twice   <cit> . therefore, we performed meta-coexpression analysis using multiple experiments to increases the accuracy of the prediction of the co-expression links.

since bdnf served as a guide-gene for our microarray study, qualitative and quantitative criteria were applied for selection of the experiments with respect to bdnf probe set presence on the platform , bdnf signal quality and expression levels. in addition, non-specific filtering  <cit>  was performed to eliminate the noise . consequently,  <dig> human, mouse and rat microarray experiments  from gene expression omnibus  database met the selection criteria. each dataset was split into subsets according to the annotation file included in the experiment . in summary,  <dig> subsets were obtained from  <dig> human,  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat datasets. from  <dig> human datasets,  <dig> were related to neurological diseases  and contained samples from human brain; another  <dig> datasets contained samples from human "normal"  tissues ;  <dig> datasets had samples from cancerous tissues of various origins . the rest  <dig> datasets contained samples from diseased non-neural tissues . out of  <dig> mouse datasets,  <dig> datasets were related to neurological diseases ;  <dig> datasets contained normal tissue samples ;  <dig> dataset contained lung cancer samples;  <dig> datasets were related to non-neural tissues' diseases . among  <dig> rat datasets,  <dig> datasets were related to neurological diseases ,  <dig> datasets were with "normal tissue samples" composition and  <dig> datasets examined heart diseases .

according to elo and colleagues  <cit>  the reproducibility of the analysis of eight samples approaches 55%. selecting subsets with more than eight samples for the analysis could increase the reproducibility of the experiment however reducing the coverage, since subsets with lower number of samples would be excluded. thus, we selected subsets with a minimum of eight samples for the analysis, in order to achieve satisfactory reproducibility and coverage. the expression information for human, mouse and rat genes obtained from geo database, information about bdnf probe names used for each dataset, information about subsets derived from each experiment, and data on correlation of expression between bdnf and other genes for each microarray subset has been made available online and can be accessed using the following link: .

differential expression of bdnf across subsets
since the study was based on analyzing subsets defined by experimental conditions  it was of biological interest to examine if bdnf is differentially expressed across subsets within a dataset. we used kruskal-wallis test  <cit>  to measure differential expression. the results of this analysis are given in the additional files  <dig>   <dig> and 6: differential expression of the bdnf gene in human, mouse and rat datasets.

co-expression analysis
since the expression of bdnf alternative transcripts is tissue-specific and responds to the variety of stimuli, seeking for correlated genes in each subset separately could help to reveal condition-specific co-expression. the term "subset" in this case must be understood as "a set of samples under the same condition".

we derived  <dig> human,  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat subsets from the corresponding datasets. pearson correlation coefficient  was chosen as a similarity measure since it is one of the most commonly used, with many publications describing analysis of affymetrix platforms  <cit> . pcc between bdnf and other genes' probe sets was measured across samples for each subset separately. from each subset, probe sets with pcc r >  <dig>  were selected. it was demonstrated by elo and colleagues  <cit>  that in the analysis of simulated datasets a cutoff value r =  <dig>  showed both high reproducibility  and low error. a "data-driven cutoff value" approach has been rejected because it is based on the connectivity of the whole network, whereas we focused only on the links between bdnf and other genes. a lower threshold of  <dig>  generated a list of genes that showed no significant similarities when analyzed using g:profiler tool that retrieves most significant go terms, kegg and reactome pathways, and transfac motifs for a user-specified group of genes  <cit> . the value r =  <dig>  was chosen over more stringent pcc values because the lengths of the expression profiles were not too short . moreover, the pcc threshold higher than  <dig>  was not justified since we performed further filtering by selecting only conserved correlated genes, thus controlling the spurious results.

each probe set correlation with bdnf that passed the threshold was defined as a "link". it has been previously shown that a link must be confirmed in at least  <dig> experiments  in order to be called reliable  <cit> . therefore, we selected  genes for evolutionary conservation analysis, narrowing the list of correlated genes to eliminate the noise. g:profiler analysis of these genes revealed that the results are statistically significant  and the genes belong to go categories that are relevant to biological functions of bdnf. for example, the list of human genes produced the following results when analyzed with g:profiler : nervous system development , central nervous system development , synaptic transmission , generation of neurons , neuron differentiation , neurite development , heart development , blood vessel development , regulation of angiogenesis , response to wounding , muscle development , regulation of apoptosis , etc.

we have used r =  <dig>  as a "hard" threshold value for the cc. a disadvantage of this approach is that there will be no connection between bdnf and other genes whose correlation with bdnf is  <dig>  in a specific dataset  <cit> . using multiple datasets was expected to remedy this effect. an alternative approach would be to use "soft" threshold approaches  <cit> . according to the soft threshold approach, a weight between  <dig> and  <dig> is assigned to the connection between each pair of genes . often, the weight between the nodes a and b is represented by some power of the cc between a and b. however, other similarity measures may be used given that they are restricted in  <cit> . a drawback of the weighted cc approach is that it is not clear how to define nodes that are directly linked to a specific node  <cit>  because the available information is related only to how strongly two nodes are connected. thus, if neighbors to a node are requested, threshold should be applied to the connection strengths. alternatively, li and horvath  <cit>  have developed an approach to answer this question based on extending the topological overlap measure , which means that the nodes  should be strongly connected and belong to the same group of nodes. however, this analysis requires the whole network of a set of genes. in the current analysis, we did not construct the co-expression network for all the genes of microarray experiments. instead, we focused on a small part of it i.e. the bdnf gene and the genes linked to bdnf. therefore, tom analysis was not possible using our approach.

to see how the "weighted cc" method would affect the results of our study we used a simplified approach. instead of applying "hard" threshold  for the cc we measured the strength of all the connections between bdnf and all the genes in a microarray experiment. the connection strength sj = b, where ccj denotes the cc between bdnf and the gene j, is between  <dig> and  <dig> and b is an integer. in order to define b, analysis of the scale-free properties of the network is required. however, we used the value  <dig>  great b values give lower weight to weak connections. then we calculated the average sj) among all the subsets. finally, we sorted the genes based on their ave and calculated the overlap of the top of this list with our results for each species . when restricting the top of the weighted cc list to the same number of genes that we have obtained for the 3+ list for each species, we observed that the top-weighted cc genes overlap extensively with the 3+ list  for each species. therefore, even though the "soft" and "hard" thresholding approaches are considerably different we observe quite extensive overlap of the results. we would like to stress that we did not apply the full weighted cc and tom methodology since it would require the construction of the whole network which was beyond the aims of our study. however, such investigation of the whole co-expression network could contribute to the understanding of bdnf regulation and function.

correlation conservation and g:profiler analysis
co-expression that is conserved between phylogenetically distant species may reveal functional gene associations  <cit> . we searched for common genes in the lists of  <dig> human,  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat genes . from these genes,  <dig> were found to be correlated with bdnf in human and mouse,  <dig> correlated with bdnf in human and rat, and  <dig> conserved between mouse and rat . we found a total of  <dig> genes whose co-expression with bdnf was conserved in all three organisms  .

go categories marked with a star  have been reported as statistically significant for this gene list by g:profiler analysis tool. human gene names are given representing mouse and rat orthologs whenever gene names for all three species are not the same. go - gene ontology, pw - pathway, tf - transcription factor, ns - nervous system.

due to a variety of reasons , when measured only in one dataset/subset, some of the co-expression links might occur by chance. checking for multiple re-occurrence of a link is expected to reduce the number of false-positive links. more importantly, the conservation analysis should further reduce the number of artifacts. however, since our analysis comprised a multitude of subsets it was important to estimate the statistical significance of the results. to tackle this problem, we created randomized subsets similarly to what was described by lee and colleagues  <cit>  and calculated the distribution of correlated 3+ links for each species separately. the results showed that our co-expression link confirmation analysis resulted in a significantly higher number of links compared to the randomized data . however, it should be mentioned that the number of 3+ links remained quite high in the randomized datasets: for human subsets it constituted about 58% of the observed 3+ links, for mouse about 43% and for rat 21%. these results justify the subsequent co-expression conservation analysis step. indeed, in random human, mouse and rat subsets the number of correlated 3+ links was only about 9% of the discovered conserved bdnf-correlated links .

analysis of the list of  <dig> conserved bdnf-correlated genes using g:profiler showed significantly low p-values for all the genes and revealed significant go categories related to bdnf actions . statistically significant go categories included: i) myc-associated zinc finger protein  targets ; ii) signal transduction ; iii) nervous system development ; iv) kruppel-box protein homolog  targets ; v) transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase pathway ; vi) dendrite localization  .

according to the gene ontology database, conserved bdnf-correlated gene products participate in axonogenesis , dendrite development , synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission , regeneration , regulation of apoptosis , klf <dig>  nefl, plagl <dig>  prkce, scg <dig>  snca, and tbx3), skeletal muscle development  and angiogenesis  . out of  <dig>   <dig> bdnf-correlated genes are related to cancer and  <dig> are involved in neurological disorders .

interactions among correlated genes
we searched if any of the correlated genes had known interactions with bdnf using information hyperlinked over proteins gene network . ihop allows navigating the literature cited in pubmed and gives as an output all sentences that connect gene a and gene b with a verb  <cit> . we constructed a "gene network" using the ihop gene model tool to verify bdnf-co-expression links with the experimental evidences reported in the literature . for the url links to the cited literature see additional file 9: ihop references.

according to the literature,  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved correlated genes have been reported to have functional interaction or co-regulation with bdnf . igfbp <dig>  <cit> , nr4a <dig>  rgs <dig>  <cit>  and dusp <dig>  <cit>  have been previously reported to be co-expressed with human or rodent bdnf. other gene products, such as fgfr <dig>  <cit>  and snca  <cit>  are known to regulate bdnf expression. proprotein convertase pcsk <dig> is implied in processing of pro-bdnf  <cit> . ptprf tyrosine phosphatase receptor associates with ntrk <dig> and modulates neurotrophic signaling pathways  <cit> . thyroid hormone receptor alpha  induces expression of bdnf receptor ntrk <dig>  <cit> . finally, expression of such genes like egr <dig>  <cit> , mbp  <cit> , nefl  <cit> , nptx <dig>  <cit> , ntrk <dig>  serpine <dig>  <cit> , scg <dig>  <cit> , snca  <cit>  and tcf <dig>   <cit>  is known to be regulated by bdnf signaling. ccnd <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  egr <dig> and rgs <dig> gene expression is altered in cortical gaba neurons in the absence of bdnf  <cit> .

ihop reports the total of  <dig> interactions with human bdnf. in order to assess the probability of observing 17/ <dig> or more functional interactions between bdnf and other genes, we had to make an assumption regarding the total number of human genes that ihop uses. a lower number of total genes would result in higher p-values whereas a higher number of total genes would produce lower p-values. we assumed that the total number of human genes is n =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  furthermore, the total number of genes linked to bdnf is m =  <dig> based on ihop data. thus, the p-values were obtained using the right-tail of the hypergeometric probability distribution. for n =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  the p-values are  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> respectively.

by analyzing the ihop network indirect connections with bdnf could be established for the genes that did not have known direct interactions with bdnf . for example, scg <dig> protein is found in neuroendocrine vesicles and is cleaved by pcsk <dig>  <cit>  - protease that cleaves pro-bdnf. bdnf and ntrk <dig> signaling affect snca gene expression and alpha-synuclein deposition in substantia nigra  <cit> . atf <dig> gene is regulated by egr <dig>  <cit> , which expression is activated by bdnf  <cit> . for more interactions see figure  <dig> 

motif discovery
assuming that genes with similar tissue-specific expression patterns are likely to share common regulatory elements, we clustered co-expressed genes according to their tissue-specific expression using information provided by tiprod database  <cit> . each tissue was assigned a category and the genes expressed in corresponding tissues were clustered into the following categories: i) cns, ii) peripheral ns , ii) endocrine, iii) gastrointestinal, and iv) genitourinary. we applied dire  <cit>  and confac  <cit>  motif-discovery tools to search for statistically over-represented tfbss in the clusters and among all conserved bdnf-correlated genes. dire can detect regulatory elements outside of proximal promoter regions, as it takes advantage of the full gene locus to conduct the search. the software predicts function-specific regulatory elements  consisting of clusters of specifically associated and conserved tfbss, and it also scores the association of individual tfs with the biological function shared by the group of input genes  <cit> . dire selects a set of candidate res from the gene loci based on the inter-species conservation pattern which is available in the form of precomputed alignments of genomic sequence from fish, rodent, human and other vertebrate lineages  <cit> . this type of the alignment enables the tool to detect regulatory elements that are phylogenetically conserved at the same genomic positions in different species. confac software  <cit>  enables the identification of conserved enriched tfbss in the regulatory regions of sets of genes. to perform the search, human and mouse genomic sequences from orthologous gene pairs are compared by pairwise blast, and only significantly conserved  regions are analyzed for tfbss.

using dire we discovered two regulatory regions at the human bdnf locus that were enriched in tfbss  . the first regulatory region spans  <dig> bp and is located  <dig> bp upstream of human bdnf exon i transcription start site . the second putative regulatory region is  <dig> bp long and located  <dig> bp downstream of the bdnf stop-codon. analysis of mouse and rat gene lists produced similar results. significant over-representation of binding sites for wt <dig>  krox, znf <dig>  nfkb, sox, creb, oct, myod and mef <dig> transcription factors was reported by dire in bdnf and bdnf-correlated genes when all the genes were analyzed as one cluster . also, the following cluster-specific over-representation of tfbss was detected: i) cns - krox; ii) endocrine - tal1beta/tcf <dig>  ets <dig>  sox <dig>  and arid5b ; iii) gastrointestinal - mmef <dig>  and srebf1; iv) genitourinary - atf4/creb, and gtf <dig>   .

pou3f2
in bdnf, tfbss were found in promoters , exons or 3'utr of the gene. in the correlated genes, tfbss were searched for and discovered mostly in promoters . p-values are given for the tfbss discovered using confac. na - not applicable for the tfbss discovered using dire .

to cross-check the results obtained with dire, we repeated the analysis using the confac tool. confac results overlapped with dire results and suggested novel regulatory elements in human bdnf promoters/exons i-ix and in bdnf 3'utr, which were highly conserved among mammals and over-represented in the bdnf-correlated genes. then, evolutionary conservation across mammals was checked for the core element of each tfbs discovered in the bdnf gene using ucsc genome browser. based on mw test results , on the importance score  and on the conservation data , we propose potential regulators of bdnf  . it is remarkable, that the tfbss discovered in the bdnf gene are highly conserved: most of the tfbss are 100% conserved across mammals from human to armadillo, some of them being conserved even in fish .

discussion
microarray meta-analysis has proved to be useful for constructing large gene-interaction networks and inferring evolutionarily conserved pathways. however, it is rarely used to explore the regulatory mechanisms of a single gene. we have exploited microarray data from  <dig> experiments for the purpose of the detailed analysis of the conservation of bdnf gene expression and regulation. analysis of co-expression conservation combined with motif discovery allowed us to predict potential regulators of bdnf gene expression as well as to propose novel gene interactions. several transcription factors that were identified here as potential regulators of human bdnf gene have been previously shown to regulate rodent bdnf transcription in vitro and in vivo. these transcription factors include rest  for bdnf promoter ii  <cit> , creb for bdnf promoter i and iv  <cit> , usf  <cit> , nfkb  <cit> , and mef <dig> for bdnf promoter iv  <cit> . the support of the bioinformatics findings by experimental evidence strongly suggests that the potential regulatory elements discovered in this study in the bdnf locus may be involved in the regulation of bdnf expression.

according to g:profiler,  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved correlated genes identified in this study  carry myc-associated zinc finger protein  transcription factor binding sites. our study revealed putative binding sites for maz in bdnf promoter vh and in exons iii and iv, suggesting that maz could be involved in bdnf gene regulation from promoters iii, and possibly from promoters iv, v, vh and vi that lie in close proximity in the genome. it has been shown that maz is a transcriptional regulator of muscle-specific genes in skeletal and cardiac myocytes  <cit> . histone deacetylation and dna methylation might be involved in the regulation of expression of target genes by maz  <cit> . bdnf mrna expression in the heart is driven by promoters iv, vh and vi  <cit> . epigenetic regulation of the bdnf gene expression is achieved in a cell-type and promoter-specific manner  <cit> . this could be a possible regulation mechanism of the bdnf gene by maz. also, maz drives tumor-specific expression of pparg in breast cancer cells, a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in breast cancer  <cit> . expression levels of bdnf and bdnf-correlated genes ccnd <dig>  dusp <dig>  egr <dig>  klf <dig> and ptprf are altered in breast cancer . these genes were identified as putative targets of maz in the present study suggesting potential role for maz in their regulation in breast cancer cells.

our analysis revealed that wilms' tumor suppressor  <dig>  transcription factor binding sites are overrepresented in the bdnf-correlated genes. wt <dig> binding sites were detected in bdnf promoter i, in irs <dig> , egr <dig>  baiap <dig>  and pura promoters and in  <dig> other genes. wt <dig> acts as an oncogene in wilms' tumor , gliomas  <cit>  and various other human cancers  <cit> . wt <dig> activates the pdgfa gene in desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, which contributes to the fibrosis associated with this tumor  <cit> . puralpha , a putative wt <dig> target gene identified in this study, has also been reported to enhance transcription of the pdgfa gene  <cit> . wt <dig> regulates the expression of several factors from the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway  <cit> . wt <dig> was also shown to bind the promoter of egr <dig> gene  <cit> . neurotrophins and their receptors also may be involved in the pathogenesis of some wilms' tumors  <cit> . transcriptional activation of bdnf receptor ntrk <dig> by wt <dig> has been shown to be important for normal vascularization of the developing heart  <cit> . moreover, wt <dig> might have a role in neurodegeneration, observed in alzheimer's disease brain  <cit> . we hypothesize that bdnf and other wt <dig> targets identified in this study, can play a role in normal development and tumorigenesis associated with wt <dig> 

krox family transcription factors' binding sites were found to be abundant in the promoters of bdnf and bdnf-correlated genes. krox binding motif was detected in bdnf promoter v and egr <dig> binding site was found in bdnf promoter iv. also, egr <dig> gene expression was correlated with bdnf in human, mouse and rat. krox family of zinc finger-containing transcriptional regulators, also known as early growth response  gene family, consists of egr1-egr <dig> brain-specific transcription factors  <cit>  that are able to bind to the same consensus dna sequence   <cit> . egr <dig> is involved in the maintenance of long-term potentiation  and is required for the consolidation of long-term memory  <cit> . egr <dig> is essential for short-term memory formation  <cit>  and egr <dig> is necessary for schwann cell differentiation and myelination  <cit> . since bdnf plays a significant role in the above mentioned processes, it would be intriguing to study the regulation of bdnf by egr factors.

binding sites for gfi <dig> and mef <dig> were found in bdnf promoters, exons and 3'utr, and in the promoter of the snca gene. gfi <dig> binding sites were detected in bdnf promoters ii-vi and in exon i. mef <dig> sites were found in bdnf promoters ii-v and in exons ii and ix. snca overexpression and gene mutations that lead to snca protein aggregation cause parkinson's disease   <cit> . bdnf and snca expression levels change conversely in the nigro-striatal dopamine region of the pd brain  <cit> . the myocyte enhancer factor- <dig>  is known to be necessary for neurogenesis and activity-dependent neuronal survival  <cit> . inactivation of mef <dig> is responsible for dopaminergic loss in vivo in an mptp mouse model of pd  <cit> . mef <dig> recruits transcriptional co-repressor cabin <dig> and class ii hdacs to specific dna sites in a calcium-dependent manner  <cit> . mef <dig> is one of the tfs that contribute to the activity-dependent bdnf transcription from promoter iv  <cit> . the growth factor independence- <dig>  transcription factor is essential for the development of neuroendocrine cells, sensory neurons, and blood. also, gfi <dig> acts as an oncogene in human small cell lung cancer , the deadliest neuroendocrine tumor  <cit> . gfi <dig> mediates reversible transcriptional repression by recruiting the eight  <dig> corepressor , histone deacetylase  enzymes and the g9a histone lysine methyltransferase  <cit> . it has also been shown that gfi <dig> drosophila homolog senseless interacts with proneural proteins and functions as a transcriptional co-activator suggesting that gfi <dig> also cooperates with bhlh proteins in several contexts  <cit> . our findings are impelling to explore inverse regulation of bdnf and snca genes by gfi <dig> and mef <dig> in neurons generally and in parkinson's disease models in particular.

bdnf promoters ii-v and bdnf exons ii, iv and ix contain brn <dig>  binding sequences. brn <dig> is driving expression of the egr <dig> gene - an important factor controlling myelination in schwann cells  <cit> . brn <dig> also activates the promoter of the notch ligand delta <dig>  regulating neurogenesis. it also regulates the division of neural progenitors, as well as differentiation and migration of neurons  <cit> . considering a prominent role of bdnf in myelination and neurogenesis, it is reasonable to hypothesize that brn <dig> fulfills its tasks in part by regulating bdnf gene expression.

evidence is emerging that not only proximal promoters, but also distant elements upstream and downstream from tss can regulate transcription  <cit> . we found that bdnf 3'utr contains potential binding sites for tcf <dig> , gfi <dig>  brn <dig>  nfkb and mef <dig> 

finally, we have discovered multiple binding sites in human bdnf promoters for the transcription factors that have been shown to participate in neuronal activity-dependent transcription of rodent bdnf gene. bdnf promoters i and iv are the most highly induced following neuronal activation. bdnf promoter i was shown to be regulated by camp-responsive element  and the binding sequence for upstream stimulatory factor 1/ <dig>  in response to neuronal activity and elevated calcium levels  <cit> . several tfs  regulate bdnf promoter iv upon calcium influx into neurons. rat bdnf promoter ii has also shown induction by neuronal activity, though to a lesser extent compared to promoters i and iv  <cit> . however, calcium responsive elements have not been yet studied in bdnf promoter ii and it was believed that its induction is regulated by the elements located in the promoter i. our analysis of human bdnf gene detected crebp <dig> and usf binding sites in bdnf promoter i, usf and mef <dig> binding sites in promoter ii and usf, mef <dig> and creb binding sites in promoter iv. we suggest that mef <dig> and usf elements might contribute to bdfn promoter ii induction by neuronal activity. in addition, we have detected conserved tcf <dig>  binding sequences in bdnf promoter iv, and in exon i. it has been shown that calcium-sensor protein calmodulin can interact with the dna binding basic helix-loop-helix  domain of tcf <dig> inhibiting its transcriptional activity  <cit> . preliminary experimental evidence  suggests that tcf <dig> transcription factor is involved in the regulation of bdnf transcription. tcf <dig> might play in concert with creb, mef <dig> and other transcription factors to modulate bdnf levels following neuronal activity.

in our study we performed the analysis of a well-known gene and it served as a good reference to evaluate the results of the "subset" approach. however, the "subset" method coupled with the analysis of evolutionary conservation of co-expression is suitable for studying poorly annotated genes as well. this approach examines co-expression across a variety of conditions, which helps to discover novel biological processes and pathways that the guide-gene and its co-expressed genes are related to. also, searching for conserved tfbs modules in co-expressed genes helps to discover functionally important genomic regions and this does not require detailed prior knowledge of the guide-gene's structure. however, when attempting to study less known genes, additional in silico analysis of genomic sequences using bioinformatics tools for prediction of promoters, tsss and exon-intron junctions would be useful. also, sequence alignment with co-expressed genes' promoters would be informative.

CONCLUSIONS
a major impediment of meta-coexpression analysis is the differences among experiments. so far, analyzing gene expression across different microarray platforms remains a challenge. discrepancies in the expression measurements among different platforms originate from different probe sequences used, different number of genes on the platform, etc. therefore, in order to obtain reliable results, we used only one microarray platform type for the analysis. in addition, we introduced a new approach to increase the accuracy of the analysis: we divided datasets into subsets and sought for correlated genes for each subset, implying that each subset represents an independent experimental condition. we have also performed correlation link confirmation among subsets and correlation conservation analysis to discover functionally related genes.

one of the limitations of the co-expression conservation analysis is the fact that it detects only phylogenetically conserved co-expression events. human-specific phenomena cannot be captured by this kind of analysis. in relation to bdnf this means, for example, that regulation of human bdnf gene by antisense bdnf rna   <cit>  could not be studied by co-expression conservation analysis, since bdnfos gene is not expressed in rodents  <cit> . also, co-expression analysis using microarray experiments is limited by the number of genes included in the microarray platforms. for example, since bdnfos probe sets were absent from microarray platforms, we could not study co-expression, anti-coexpression or differential expression of bdnf and bdnfos. in addition, our list of correlated genes did not include all possible correlation links with bdnf due to the fact that our analysis was deliberately limited to affymetrix microarray platforms. moreover, in our analysis we included only those experiments that met certain requirements regarding the bdnf gene expression. however, biologically meaningful results justify our rigorous filtering approach: correlated genes identified in this study are known to regulate nervous system development, and are associated with various types of cancer and neurological disorders. also, experimental evidence supports the hypothesis, that transcription factor identified here can act as potential bdnf regulators.

in summary, we have discovered a set of genes whose co-expression with bdnf was conserved between human and rodents. also, we detected new potential regulatory elements in bdnf-correlated genes and in the bdnf locus using bioinformatics analysis, in which bdnf was playing a role of a guide-gene. the presented concept of co-expression conservation analysis can be used to study the regulation of any other gene of interest. the study provides an example of using high-throughput advancements in studying single genes and proposes hypotheses that could be tested using molecular biology techniques.
