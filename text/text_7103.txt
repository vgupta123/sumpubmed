BACKGROUND
peptide transporters from the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter  family  <cit>  are integral membrane proteins that mediate the cellular uptake of di- and tripeptides using energy provided by transmembrane proton gradients. pots belong to the major facilitator superfamily  of secondary active transporters and are found in all kingdoms of life where they play major roles in nutrition and signaling  <cit> . in humans the absorption of dietary peptides and of numerous orally administrated drugs is mediated by the two peptide transporters pept <dig>  and pept <dig> . pept <dig> and pept <dig> are predominantly expressed in epithelial cells of the small intestine and kidney, respectively  <cit> . pept <dig> operates as a high-capacity, low-affinity transporter with affinities  and inhibition constants  ranging from  <dig> μm to  <dig> mm depending on the substrate  <cit> . on the other hand, pept <dig> is a low-capacity, high-affinity transporter with km and ki values ranging from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm depending on the substrate  <cit> . these kinetic properties make pept <dig> and pept <dig> ideal for the promiscuous and more specific absorption of a broad range of dietary peptides in the small intestine and in the kidney, respectively. the human pept <dig> and pept <dig> transporters have become of major pharmaceutical importance, as they are responsible for the uptake of β-lactam antibiotics and peptide prodrugs  <cit> .

the first crystal structure of a pot family member, peptso from the bacterium shewanella oneidensis, was published in  <dig> and revealed a novel occluded conformation of an mfs transporter  <cit> . in the following years several additional structures of prokaryotic peptide transporters were reported: peptst from streptococcus thermophilus  <cit> ; gkpot from geobacillus kaustophilus  <cit> ; peptso <dig> from shewanella oneidensis  <cit> ; and ybgh from escherichia coli   <cit> . all these structures revealed a conserved architecture consisting of  <dig> transmembrane α-helices  with n- and c-terminal six-helix bundles  and two additional transmembrane α-helices  connecting the two bundles. the structures of gkpot  <cit>  and peptso <dig>  <cit>  were obtained in complex with alafosfalin, an antibacterial phosphono dipeptide, and the structures of peptst  <cit>  and peptso <dig>  <cit>  in complex with di- and tripeptides, giving first structural insights into the promiscuous substrate recognition of peptide transporters. in spite of the available structural information several key questions remain open. these questions include the molecular bases for the specific recognition of substrates, such as charged dipeptides and of the individual side chains in dipeptides, namely n- versus c-terminal amino acid side chain.

we have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the pot family member yepept from yersinia enterocolitica at  <dig> Å resolution. this structure together with structure-function studies unveiled the molecular basis for recognition of dipeptides with a charged amino acid side chain at the n-terminal position by yepept. importantly, structural and functional insights gained from this prokaryotic peptide transporter were used to perform specific uptake experiments with human pept <dig> expressed in xenopus oocytes. this knowledge helped to extend our current understanding of substrate recognition and specificity in human pept <dig> 

RESULTS
from bacteria to mammals, peptide transporters from the pot family  family  <cit> ) strongly differ in amino acid sequence and protein size. however, three small protein stretches are conserved: the efxerfxyyg; gxxxadxxxgkxxtixxxsxxyxxg ; and fsxfyxainxgsl  motifs  <cit> . residues of these three signature motifs, which are highly conserved in human pept <dig>  and pept <dig> , and other higher eukaryotes, are mostly conserved in yepept . the conserved efxerfxyyg, ptr2_ <dig> and ptr2_ <dig> motifs are essential for peptide transport function  <cit> .

for functional and structural studies, the gene of yepept was cloned and the protein overexpressed in e. coli .

functional characterization of yepept
transport function of yepept was determined using the reporter radioligand ala-ala, which displayed a km of about  <dig> μm . this km is comparable to the determined kis of hpept <dig>  and hpept <dig>  for ala-ala  <cit> . competition experiments with ala-ala in the presence of the amino acid l-ala and its di-, tri- and tetrapeptides indicated a clear preference of yepept for the dipeptide ala-ala only . this is in contrast to hpept <dig> and hpept <dig>  and numerous other pot family members, which also possess specificity for the tripeptide ala-ala-ala and other tripeptides  <cit> . for further characterization of transport, we studied the requirements of na+ and h+ as co-transport ions. the replacement of na+ by choline had no effect on the uptake of ala-ala, but the presence of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone  caused complete abolition of transport . thus, and as expected for pot family members, peptide uptake via yepept depends on the electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane.fig.  <dig> functional characterization of yepept. a kinetics of yepept-mediated ala-ala uptake in e. coli cells. uptake of the radioligand in e. coli cells transformed with the yepept construct  and the empty vector  is shown. the determined km is indicated. error bars represent sem from triplicates. one representative experiment from three similar independent experiments is shown. b co-transport ion and substrate chain length dependence of uptake: na+ dependence was assessed by replacing na+ with choline ; and h+ dependence by addition of the proton-ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone . chain length dependence was assessed with l-ala and the corresponding di-, tri- and tetrapeptides as competitors . c substrate specificity of yepept by competition assay . error bars in  and  represent sem from at least three independent experiments, each in triplicate. d ki determination of yepept for asp-ala. the determined ki is indicated . error bars represent sem from triplicates. one representative experiment from three similar independent experiments is shown



the dipeptide binding preference of yepept  was addressed as follows: in a systematic manner, one amino acid in the reporter dipeptide ala-ala was replaced at a time at both positions, r <dig>  and r <dig> , by amino acids of different chemical properties, namely negatively and positively charged, and hydrophobic. yepept indicated an important specificity for a dipeptide with a negatively charged amino acid side chain at the r <dig> position, that is for asp-ala . this was further confirmed by the determination of the ki of yepept for asp-ala . with a ki of about  <dig> μm , yepept had a clearly higher affinity for a dipeptide with a negatively charged amino acid side chain at r <dig> position compared to ala-ala . to support this finding and for comparison with asp-ala, the affinity of yepept for glu-ala was determined, which was about  <dig> μm . considering these ki values, yepept had a slightly higher affinity for glu-ala compared to asp-ala. however, the affinities for these dipeptides harboring negatively charged residues at the r <dig> position and differing by one methylene group in chain length were not substantially different. although not so pronounced as for asp-ala and ala-ala, yepept also displayed specificity for ala-tyr and tyr-ala at comparable levels . such a behavior, that is the indifference for the position of the large, hydrophobic side chain of the amino acid residue tyr in dipeptides, was also observed for hpept <dig>  <cit> .

overall structure of yepept
the crystal structure of yepept was solved at  <dig> Å resolution by x-ray crystallography . the quality of the obtained density map can be assessed in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the structure displays  <dig> transmembrane helices with h1–h <dig> and h7–h <dig> forming the n- and c-terminal six-helix bundles . these two terminal domains are related by a pseudo-twofold symmetry  and are representative of the canonical mfs fold  <cit> . the two peripheral transmembrane α-helices ha and hb  form a hairpin-like structure connecting n- and c-terminal bundles, and are generally found in prokaryotic peptide transporters. the function of these two linker transmembrane α-helices is currently unclear. the solved yepept crystal structure is in the inward-open conformation, similar to most prokaryotic peptide transporter structures  . this conformational state displays a large central, conical cavity facing the cytosol .table  <dig> data collection and refinement statistics for yepept

substrate-binding pocket of yepept
at present the structures of the peptide transporters gkpot mutant e310q   <cit>  and peptst  <cit>  represent the crystal structures solved in complex with substrates at the highest resolution, namely gkpote310q with alafosfalin at  <dig>  Å  and peptst with the dipeptide ala-phe at  <dig>  Å . we made numerous attempts to co-crystallize yepept with substrate, but were not successful. therefore, and to identify the putative substrate-binding pocket of yepept, we aligned the crystal structure of yepept with the substrate-bound gkpote310q and peptst structures. this yielded hypothetical models of substrate-bound yepept. comparison of these models identified the yepept residues located in proximity of the two ligands . no noteworthy clashes were observed between the yepept structure and the ligands alafosfalin and ala-phe, the closest interatomic distances being  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. all amino acid residues in gkpote310q and peptst involved in the binding of the backbone of the dipeptide analogue alafosfalin and the dipeptide ala-phe were also conserved in yepept . these conserved amino acid residues were classified into four groups according to their interactions with the backbones of alafosfalin and ala-phe: group i) asn <dig> and glu <dig> ; group ii) tyr <dig> and asn <dig> ; group iii) tyr <dig>  arg <dig>  tyr <dig> and glu <dig> ; and group iv) arg <dig> and lys <dig>  . besides group iii), which specifically interacts with the phosphonate group of alafosfalin, the other three groups represent the general recognition mode of the backbone of dipeptides. these interactions of the transporter with the dipeptide backbone, which are dipeptide side chains independent interactions, can be considered as responsible for the substrate polyspecificity  observed in most peptide transporters.fig.  <dig> substrate-binding pocket of yepept. top view from the cytosol  and view from the membrane plane  of the substrate-binding pocket of yepept. the areas marked by the black boxes in  and  are displayed at higher magnification in  and , and  and , respectively. amino acid residues of yepept potentially involved in alafosfalin  and ) and dipeptide backbone binding  and ) are labeled, colored in black and conserved in yepept, gkpote310q and peptst . the indicated amino acid residues of yepept were identified by superposition of the yepept structure with the ligand-bound peptide transporter structures 4d2c  <cit>  and 4ikz  <cit>  . the distances between the nitrogen atom of lys <dig> and the carbon atoms of the n-terminally located methyl groups of alafosfalin  and ala-phe  are marked, and indicate available space between ligands and lys314; for example, for accommodation of longer side chains. the n- and c-terminal six-helix bundles are colored in salmon and cyan, respectively, and helices ha and hb in black. yepept polypeptide chains in  and  that could not be traced are indicated by broken lines



a prominent feature of yepept is the presence of a lysine residue  close to the above described binding pocket . the presence of this positively charged residue was particularly interesting considering the high affinity of yepept for dipeptides with a negatively charged amino acid at r <dig> position, namely asp-ala  and glu-ala . a plausible molecular explanation for the observed substrate affinity is an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged carboxyl group at the r <dig> side chains in asp-ala and glu-ala, and the positively charged residue lys <dig> in yepept. mutagenesis in silico of ala-phe  into asp-ala, keeping the dipeptide backbone of ala-phe fixed and mutating the side chains, yielded a hypothetical model of yepept with bound asp-ala . the displayed rotamer of asp in asp-ala fits best into the yepept structure without introducing any clashes. based on this model, the distance between the closest oxygen atom  of the β-carboxyl group in the asp side chain of asp-ala and the nitrogen atom  of the ε-amino group in the lys <dig> side chain was  <dig>  Å . this relatively large distance is not compatible with a salt bridge. however, adoption of a different rotamer of lys <dig> upon binding of asp-ala would decrease this distance significantly from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å, thus allowing the formation of a salt bridge . such a salt bridge would neutralize the positive charge on the ε-amino group of lys <dig>  but how is this charge stabilized in the absence of a negatively charged ligand such as asp-ala? to answer this pertinent question, neighboring residues of lys <dig> within a distance of ≤ <dig> Å in the crystal structure were considered and phe <dig> was identified as an interacting partner. the o of the phe <dig> carbonyl group and the n of the ε-amino group of lys <dig> are within hydrogen bonding distance . furthermore, this n is  <dig> - <dig>  Å away from the carbon atoms of the phenyl group of phe <dig> and thus compatible with a pi-cation interaction. therefore, the positive charge of the ε-amino group of lys <dig> is potentially stabilized by two molecular interactions with phe <dig> in the apo structure of yepept. to test this hypothesis, we introduced the mutation f311a  and performed ala-ala uptake experiments. clearly, yepeptf311a was almost not functional compared with wild-type yepept in spite of comparable expression levels . this result supports the notion that the positively charged ε-amino group of lys <dig> has to be stabilized to preserve peptide transport function. furthermore, it indicates that the hydrogen bond between the ε-amino group of lys <dig> and the backbone carbonyl group from the amino acid residue at position  <dig>  for example ala in yepeptf311a, is not sufficient for stabilization. therefore, the above mentioned pi-cation interaction seems to be indispensable for charge stabilization. however, we cannot exclude other effects on the transport function of yepept upon removal of such a bulky amino acid residue, such as f <dig>  an interaction of lys <dig> with the closely localized glu <dig> in yepept is improbable or weak when considering the distance of  <dig>  Å between the corresponding n and o atoms of these two residues .fig.  <dig> hypothetical model of asp-ala bound yepept and stabilizing effect of phe <dig>  a yepept structure with a virtually bound asp-ala dipeptide : this dipeptide was built by keeping the dipeptide backbone of ala-phe  fixed and mutating the side chains of ala-phe into asp-ala in pymol  <cit> . the rotamer of asp in asp-ala does not introduce any clashes with the yepept structure. the distances between the nitrogen atom of lys <dig> and the closest oxygen atoms of the carboxyl groups of asp-ala  and glu <dig> are indicated. b the rotamer of lys <dig> found in the crystal structure  and of the rotamer with the shortest distance to the closest oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of asp-ala  is shown . c in the yepept crystal structure, the interactions between lys <dig> and the stabilizing residue phe <dig> consist of a hydrogen bond and a pi-cation interaction between the ε-amino group of lys <dig>  and the carbonyl and phenyl groups of phe <dig>  respectively. amino acid residues of yepept potentially involved in dipeptide backbone binding are labeled and colored in black . the n- and c-terminal six-helix bundles are colored in salmon and cyan, respectively. d mutation of the lys <dig> stabilizing phe <dig> residue into ala dramatically reduces the transport function of yepept. expression levels in e. coli of wild-type  and yepeptf311a  used for the uptake experiments were comparable. error bars in  represent sem from two independent experiments, each in triplicate



the existence in other bacterial peptide transporters of a lys residue at the equivalent position of k <dig>  in their substrate binding pockets was evaluated. the phe-lys region , which contains this critical lys residue, is identical in several members from the large enterobacteriaceae family; for example, in members from the genus yersinia, enterobacter and klebsiella. in addition to enterobacteriaceae, the critical lys residue is also present in less conserved phe-lys regions found in other families of the gammaproteobacteria; for example, in members from the genus arenimonas, shewanella and rheinheimera from the families xanthomonadaceae, shewanellaceae and chromatiaceae.

tuning the substrate specificity of yepept
from the hypothetical model of asp-ala bound yepept , it appears likely that lys <dig> is responsible for its specificity for dipeptides with negatively charged amino acids at the r <dig> position. to test this hypothesis, we introduced the mutation k314e  and k314a  in yepept, and repeated the previous competition experiments. the results clearly demonstrated that the specificity of yepept for charged residues could be tuned  and abolished  in the corresponding mutants . in more detail, yepeptk314e acquired specificity for dipeptides with a positively charged amino acid side chain in the r <dig> position  and lost the specificity for negatively charged amino acids in that position . in contrast, yepeptk314a had no affinity for the charged dipeptides lys-ala and asp-ala . this functional data further supports the notion of the involvement of electrostatic interactions between a charged residue at position  <dig> of yepept and a dipeptide with a charged amino acid side chain at the n-terminal position. an involvement of lys <dig> in proton translocation can be excluded because the mutants yepeptk314e and yepeptk314a were fully functional . in contrast to yepept, which has a lys at position  <dig>  gkpot and peptst have both a gly residue at the equivalent position. based on the results presented above with yepeptk314a, comparable substrate specificities would be expected for gkpot and peptst. indeed, gkpot and peptst do not show significant specificity for charged dipeptides, but rather specificity for hydrophobic dipeptides  <cit> .fig.  <dig> substrate specificity of k314e and k314a yepept mutants. ala-ala uptake competition experiments performed with e. coli cells expressing  k314e and  k314a mutants of yepept. error bars represent sem from four independent experiments, each in triplicate



influence of the q300k mutation in human pept <dig> on substrate specificity
in contrast to yepept, human pept <dig> does not have a pronounced affinity for dipeptides with a negatively charged amino acid residue at r <dig> position; for example, asp-ala   <cit> . amino acid sequence alignment of yepept, hpept <dig> and hpept <dig> identified a gln residue at the position corresponding to lys <dig> in yepept . from this alignment it also appears that hpept <dig> has a phe residue at the position corresponding to phe <dig> in yepept. the availability of a phe residue at this critical position in hpept <dig>  which we showed to be essential in conjunction with lys <dig> in yepept for transport function, stimulated us to introduce the mutation q300k . comparison of the specificities for selected substrates in wild-type hpept <dig> and hpept1q300k  clearly showed that the q300k mutation induced affinity for asp-ala in hpept1q300k. furthermore, the introduction of a positively charged residue in the binding pocket significantly reduced the specificity of hpept1q300k for the positively charged dipeptide lys-ala . in summary, residue  <dig> in yepept corresponds to residue  <dig> in the binding pocket of hpept <dig>  the residue at this critical position determines substrate recognition and specificity for dipeptides charged at r <dig> position via electrostatic interactions.fig.  <dig> comparison of substrate specificities of human pept <dig> and q300k mutant. ala-ala uptake competition experiments were performed with xenopus laevis oocytes expressing  wild-type human pept <dig>  and  the q300k mutant . error bars represent sem from two independent experiments, each containing  <dig> oocytes



CONCLUSIONS
negatively charged amino acid side chains at the n-terminal position of dipeptides are recognized by lys <dig> in yepept and interact with each other via electrostatic interactions. site-directed mutagenesis of lys <dig> in yepept and the corresponding residue in human pept <dig>  can tune the substrate specificity of these peptide transporters. in summary, the crystal structure of yepept together with structure-function studies have provided the molecular bases for the recognition, binding and specificity of charged amino acid residues at the n-terminal position of dipeptides by peptide transporters of the pot family.
