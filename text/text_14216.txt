BACKGROUND
the structural maintenance of chromosome  proteins are involved in several aspects of chromosomal dynamic, in dna recombination and in dna repairs  <cit> . two smc proteins named smc <dig> and smc <dig> bind to and prevent the premature separation of sister chromatids at the end of mitosis  <cit> . smc <dig> and smc <dig> directly interact through their central globular binding domains by forming an heterodimer  <cit> . the protein complex encircles the sister chromatids and is stabilized though the interaction with two other cohesin proteins known as scc <dig> and scc <dig> in s. cereviasie  <cit> . at anaphase, the ring-shaped complex is broken down when separase, a cysteine protease, cleaves scc <dig>  thus freeing the sister chromatids to move in opposite directions  <cit> . somatic cells with deranged separase activity or lacking scc <dig> develop aneuploidy at increased rate. this suggests that the cohesin complex plays a major role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability  <cit> . the mechanism regulating the interaction between smc <dig> and smc <dig> is still poorly understood. it has however been established that a single point mutation of the central globular domain  of either one of these proteins strongly affects the dimerization rate and prevents the attachment of the cohesin complex to chromatid dna  <cit> . conceivably, proteins that interact with the hinge domain of smc <dig> or smc <dig> can act as modulator of the cohesin complex formation and may thus affect chromosomal stability. in this paper we report the identification of a new smc3-interacting protein that specifically binds to smc3's central globular domain. the sequence of the identified gene product matched that of a previously discovered hypothetical new protein with no known function. we have named the protein hinderin. the gene is expressed in all the human tissues analyzed thus far. orthologue forms of this protein are expressed in vertebrates but not in lower organisms. hinderin is a five-domain proteins and its structure resembles that of smc proteins with n- and c-terminal globular domains that are joined by a coiled coil region interrupted at the center by a third globular domain. however, unlike the canonical smc proteins, hinderin does not harbor abc-like atpase sequences. we have found that the protein interacts with the hinge region of smc <dig> but not with smc <dig>  hinderin acts as a binding competitor of smc <dig> and, as such, qualifies as a putative modulator of the smc <dig> function.

RESULTS
identification of hinderin, an smc3-interacting protein with five domain structure including coiled-coil motifs
the region of smc <dig> encompassing the protein hinge domain  was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to identify interacting proteins expressed by a human fetal brain matchmaker two-hybrid cdna library . about  <dig> ×  <dig> library clones were screened. forty blue colonies reaching  <dig> mm in size after one week were collected and  <dig> of the isolated plasmids with inserts greater than  <dig> bp were sequenced. three of the sequences matched the same region of the published cdna genbank clones ab <dig>  and al <dig> . the inserts of ~ <dig> kb included part of the gene 3'-utr. however the 5'-end of the coding region was not present in the retrieved clones. the issue was complicated by the fact that the sequences of ab <dig> and al <dig> diverged at their 5'-end. 5'-race was thus employed to identify the transcriptional start site of the interacting gene by using mrna derived from fetal kidney  <dig>  hepatoma hepg <dig>  and cervical hela human cells. all the cloned sequence coincided with that of the al <dig> clone and matched in full the putative coding sequence obtained by automated computational analysis of the human genome . the conceptually translated sequence coded for a protein of  <dig> amino acids.

the exam of the secondary structure of the protein revealed a remarkable similarity with the structural organization of smc proteins, particular with regard to the five-domain structure typical of the smc protein family. the protein features c- and n-terminal globular domains, joined by a coiled-coil sequence interrupted in the middle by a third globular domain. the size of the central globular domain is similar to that of smc <dig> and smc <dig> but the remaining domains are smaller in size. based on its ability to interact with the hinge domain of smc <dig> and thus to potentially affect smc3/smc <dig> dimerization, the new protein was named hinderin. the hinderin gene spans ~ <dig> kb of the human genome and is located on chromosome 18p11- <dig>  the coding sequence is organized in  <dig> exons . exon  <dig> is the largest and contains an extended 3'-utr. northern blot hybridization analysis performed on mrna from hela and colon carcinoma hct <dig> human cell lines, showed a single major transcriptional product of ~ <dig>  kb . a correlation between the exonic organization and the protein structural motifs was apparent . the n-terminal globular domain is encoded by exons 1– <dig>  the first coiled-coil domain is encoded by exons 4– <dig>  exon  <dig> harbors the entire central globular domain, the central coiled-coil region, and part of the c-terminal globular domain. the polypeptide encompassing exons  <dig> to  <dig> displays a 36% sequence homology to the consensus sequence of smc family of proteins. a bipartite nuclear localization signal  is located in exon  <dig> within a coiled-coil region. the hinderin expression pattern in a panel of  <dig> human tissues was analyzed by semiquantitative rt-pcr . the results indicate that the gene is expressed ubiquitously with the highest expression level detected in the lung, liver, placenta, kidney, and pancreas. the lowest expression level was detected in leukocytes and the prostate.

mapping of the hinderin and smc <dig> interaction domains
in order to map the region of hinderin interacting with smc <dig>  ah <dig> yeast was cotransformed with the smc3-465/ <dig> bait and with different hinderin constructs . yeast cotransformants of smc3-465/ <dig> and the hinderin plasmid retrieved from the two-hybrid library  grew rapidly. this result was confirmed by switching the bait and prey vectors. however, the h-47/ <dig> construct did not interact with the n- and c-terminal domains of smc <dig>  or with the hinge region of smc <dig> . a hinderin construct harboring only the protein central globular domain  furthermore did not interact with the smc <dig> bait, thus pointing to a substantial difference in the binding properties of the hinge domain of the smc proteins and the corresponding domain of hinderin. on the contrary, both the n- and c-terminal domains of hinderin  interacted with the smc <dig> hinge domain. the assay of the β-galactosidase activity expressed by the yeast as a result of the protein-protein interaction provided a quantitative measure of the rate of the process. the strongest interaction was detected between smc3-465/ <dig> or smc3-465/ <dig> and h-47/ <dig>  the hinderin constructs h-1/ <dig> and h-360/ <dig> displayed a lower interaction activity suggesting that the protein n- and c-terminal domains synergically bind to smc <dig>  an hinderin construct , consisting of the central globular domain in addition to part of the protein n-terminal domain, displayed binding activity similar to that of the n-terminal globular domain alone . the protein central globular domain therefore does not affect the binding rate of hinderin to smc <dig>  truncation mutants of smc3-465/ <dig> were generated to map the region of smc <dig> responsible for the interaction with hinderin. when tested only smc3-465/ <dig> gave origin to colonies growing at the same rate as observed with the smc <dig> bait . the remaining constructs, in which the smc <dig> hinge region had been partially or completely deleted, produced no colonies. the intact smc <dig> hinge domain is thus required for the interaction with hinderin. similarly the interaction between smc3-465/ <dig> and the hinge region of smc <dig>  gave strong reactivity whereas truncation mutants of smc <dig> lacking part of the cohesin protein central globular domain  did not interact. this finding is consistent with previous reports showing that smc <dig> and smc <dig> dimerization occurs through interaction of the terminal regions of the hinge domains of the two proteins  <cit> .

hinderin interacts with smc <dig> in vivo and is a binding competitor for smc1
in order to investigate whether hinderin associates with smc <dig> in vivo,  <dig> cells were transiently transfected with  <dig> μg/ml of hinderin-v <dig> expression vector and incubated  <dig> h. the transfected cells displayed three-fold elevation of the hinderin transcript level but smc <dig> and smc <dig> expression was not affected . after addition of anti-smc <dig> or alternatively anti-smc <dig> antibody to the cell lysate, the immunocomplexes were analyzed on sds-page followed by western-immunoblotting using anti-v <dig> antibody . this revealed the presence of hinderin-v <dig> in the smc <dig> immunoprecipitate. on the contrary, hinderin-v <dig> was not detected in the smc <dig> immunoprecipitate, thus corroborating the results of the yeast two-hybrid system interaction experiments. furthermore, smc <dig> but not smc <dig> could be recovered in hinderin-v <dig> immunocomplexes. in order to examine whether the interaction between smc <dig> and smc <dig> is affected by hinderin concentration in vivo, experiments were conducted in  <dig> cells expressing increasing levels of hinderin and by assessing the rate of smc1-smc <dig> interaction using a mammalian two-hybrid system . in this assay the interaction between the gal4:smc <dig> activating domain fusion protein and the vp16:smc1-binding domain fusion protein activates the expression of the firefly luciferase encoded by a reporter vector . the rate of interaction between smc <dig> and smc <dig> is thus directly proportional to the level of luciferase that is expressed. we found that transfection of  <dig> cells with increasing amount of the hinderin-v <dig> expression vector caused a dose-dependent decrease of luciferase activity. in cells overexpressing hinderin, the interaction between the cohesin proteins was gradually reduced down to ~34%  . ectopic expression of hinderin had no effect on the expression of the bait and prey fusion proteins as determined by rt-pcr, using primers encompassing the coding sequence of fusion proteins. the results are consistent with the notion that hinderin competes with smc <dig> for binding to smc <dig>  thereby negatively affecting the interaction between the two cohesin proteins.

discussion
in eukaryotic cells, the disjunction of the sister chromatids at the onset of anaphase is required to maintain chromosomal stability and to prevent aneuploidy  <cit> . human somatic cells with unrestrained separase activity display retarded sister separation and increased rate of chromosomal breakage  <cit> . on the other hand, the overexpression of scc <dig> in mouse fibroblasts inhibits the cells proliferation, implicating this protein and its complex with the other cohesin components in the control of mitotic cell cycle progression  <cit> . we have previously reported that overexpression of smc <dig> has cell transforming potential  <cit>  and we have determined that smc <dig> level is controlled in intestinal epithelial cells through the apc/β-catenin/tcf <dig> transactivation pathway  <cit> , a signaling system that is almost invariably altered in colon carcinomas. these findings support the idea that alteration of the level of the components of the cohesin complex has important consequences that may trigger a tumorigenic cascade. a key event in the formation of the cohesin multimeric complex is the dimerization of smc <dig> with smc <dig> which occurs through the interaction between the two proteins central globular domains. the hindrance of this process is likely to have a significant effect on the formation and the function of the cohesin complex and on the maintenance of a stable chromosome population. given this postulate, we have screened a human cdna library to identify proteins interacting with the hinge region of smc <dig>  clones coding for hinderin accounted for 15% of those identified in this screening. interaction between hinderin and smc <dig> has been further confirmed by mapping the site of binding, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates, and in a two-hybrid mammalian system. furthermore we have determined that smc <dig> and smc <dig> interaction rate is inversely related to the level of hinderin expressed by mammalian cells. hinderin displays the same five-domain structural organization of the smc family  <cit> . however, the central globular domain of the protein does not appear to be involved in the binding with smc <dig>  protein-protein interaction studies with a set of truncation constructs are rather consistent with the conclusion that smc <dig> specifically interacts with the hinderin terminal globular domains. an interaction model that is plausible with the protein-protein interaction results is illustrated in fig  <dig>  the model predicts the occupancy of the hinge region of smc <dig> by the two terminal globular domains of hinderin that come in close proximity by virtue of the flexibility of the protein central globular domain. in smc <dig> and smc <dig> the coiled-coil domains are in antiparallel orientation and by interacting they allow the n- and c-globular domains to join and form a functional atpase head that interacts with scc <dig>  <cit> . given the similarity with the structural organization of the smc proteins and the interaction modality with smc <dig>  the hinderin coiled coil domains might contribute to the binding of the n- and c-terminal globular domains to smc <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified a novel interacting partner of smc <dig>  the protein, named hinderin, specifically interacts with the hinge domain of smc <dig>  the protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. we speculate that when in a certain context, smc <dig> association with hinderin becomes favored compared to the association to smc <dig>  the availability of smc <dig> to engage in the cohesin complex formation is reduced. the binding of smc <dig> to proteins affecting its association to functional partners represents a new modality of regulation of smc <dig> activity.
