BACKGROUND
flatfish  include  <dig> different species worldwide, mostly marine, which undergo a unique developmental process during the larval-to-juvenile transition in which one eye migrates across the top of the skull to lie adjacent to the other eye on the opposite side, while the body flattens and lies on the eyeless side  <cit> . members of the order pleuronectiformes also represent an important food resource as low-fat fish with a white, flavourful flesh that is highly acceptable to consumers. despite their economic importance, flatfish production is still much lower than that of salmonids, cyprinids or other marine species such as the european sea bass and the gilthead sea bream. in europe, the main cultured flatfish species are turbot, atlantic halibut, and, to a lesser extent, the senegalese sole and the common sole  <cit> . the limited knowledge of the basic biology of flatfish has hampered the development of efficient aquaculture practices for these species. the highest mortalities during the entire fish life cycle occur during larval development, particularly during the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding, weaning and metamorphosis  <cit> . flatfish metamorphosis and other developmental events involve drastic morphological and physiological changes, the molecular basis of which remains poorly understood. the transition from larval to juvenile stage involves the development of most organs and tissues, the maturation of different physiological functions and the establishment of the immune system; therefore, this transition represents a critical step in flatfish farming. in fact, the current bottlenecks in flatfish production are mainly associated with the optimisation of larval culture and nutrition as well as the high larval mortality due to infectious diseases. the limited knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying larval development has hampered the establishment of a successful flatfish aquaculture  <cit> . in recent years, functional genomics and proteomics approaches have been applied to flatfish research in order to enhance the knowledge of the biology of these species and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying different physiological processes  <cit> . the identification and characterisation of genes and gene networks controlling traits of commercial interest such as growth rate, reproduction and disease resistance would facilitate the optimisation of production and management procedures in the industry.

the common sole , which is characterised by high flesh quality and high market value, is a very promising candidate for european aquaculture. the development of a robust sole aquaculture production will also help reduce fishing pressure on wild sole populations, which are currently overexploited. as for other flatfish species, however, several critical bottlenecks must be addressed in order to establish large scale sole farming production. feeding behaviour, susceptibility to diseases, stocking density as well as juvenile mortality represent key critical factors for sole aquaculture. although genomic tools and resources are available for some flatfish species , common sole genomics remains a mostly unexplored area of research.

here, we report for the first time the sequencing and characterisation of the transcriptome of s. solea, focusing on larval and juvenile stages. after transcriptome sequencing and annotation, an oligo-dna microarray for the detection of  <dig>  unique transcripts was developed and applied to the study of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological and morphological changes during the larval-to-juvenile transition.

RESULTS
s. solea larval transcriptome assembly and annotation
high-throughput sequencing of a s. solea cdna library generated a total of  <dig>  sequences , with a mean length of  <dig> nucleotides . newly produced sequences were assembled together with already available mrna sequences  with newbler  <dig> . the software produced a set of  <dig>  isotigs  with an average size of  <dig> nt ,  <dig> contigs and a total of  <dig>  singletons. the final number of aligned reads was  <dig>   . all isotigs and contigs have been stored in the public database transcriptome shotgun assembly sequence database  under accession number gaaq00000000; transcripts sequences can be retrieved by using the sequence name as the search criteria. the putative identities of the assembled sequences were obtained by running blastx and blastn similarity searches on  <dig> different protein and nucleotide databases. of  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig>   showed at least one significant match with a known transcript or protein. all transcripts and corresponding annotations are listed in additional file  <dig>  after further clustering by proteome mapping, a total of  <dig>  isotigs  were filtered out, yielding a total of  <dig>  unique annotated transcripts, which were employed for microarray design. the simple sequence repeats  content of all isotigs and contigs was also investigated. of  <dig>  sequences examined,  <dig>  contained at least one ssr, with  <dig> sequences showing more than one ssr, for a total of  <dig>  identified ssrs. the number of repeated dinucleotides was  <dig> , with “ac” and “tg” ssrs being the most frequent . the number of repeated trinucleotides was  <dig>  . the number of tetranucleotide repeats was  <dig>  while penta- and hexanucleotide microsatellites accounted for  <dig> and  <dig> ssrs, respectively.

global gene expression analysis
raw and normalised fluorescence data from all microarray experiments have been deposited in the geo database  <cit>  under accession number gse <dig>  three different clustering methods were employed in order to group samples according to their gene expression profiles. principal component analysis  on the entire probe set divided  <dig> sole pool samples into  <dig> separate groups , with the first and second components explaining nearly 2/ <dig>  of the variation in the entire data set. the main separation into groups of samples along the first axis closely reflects  the temporal component of larval development. however, a “horseshoe effect” with a curved distortion along the y axis was clearly visible. sample separation along the second axis sets  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae at the opposite end compared to the position of stage  <dig>  and  <dig> .

the same dataset was analysed using a som-based clustering method, autosome, which placed all samples into  <dig> major clusters , with sso_1d and sso_33c highlighted as singletons. as in the pca analysis, the sample classification reflects the temporal scale of developmental stages. pairwise affinities between samples , however, revealed a stronger relationship between  <dig> dph and  <dig> dph larvae as well as  <dig> dph and  <dig> dph individuals. the latter two stages were grouped in the same cluster. comparable results were obtained with unsupervised hierarchical clustering  analysis .

transcriptional changes over time
quantitative correlation analysis as implemented in the software significant analysis of microarray   <cit>  was used in order to identify genes whose expression either increased or decreased over time. a total of  <dig>  probes were positively correlated and  <dig>  transcripts were negatively correlated with time of larval development. the functional annotation of significant genes using david pinpointed a few pathways of particular interest . among up-regulated genes, the most significant kegg pathways are related to muscle development/contraction and glucose metabolism, while the hedgehog signalling pathway  and wnt signalling pathway  are among the most significant pathways represented by genes down-regulated over time. key components of muscle development and function such as caveolin  <dig> , troponin t , tropomyosin  and cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha  <dig> , which modulate muscle contraction as well as several form of myosin, display an increase in gene expression over time . glucose metabolism, particularly glycolysis, is represented by several genes displaying the same trend; aldolase a , glucose phosphate isomerase b , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , lactate dehydrogenase  and many others increase in expression more than 20-fold from  <dig> to  <dig> dph.

by contrast, genes included in the pathways “hedgehog signalling” and “wnt signalling” displayed decreasing expression over time . these two key pathways are involved in developmental processes and control of asymmetric cell division. in particular, a large number of genes related to “hedgehog signalling” displayed a decreasing temporal trend of expression, such as sonic hedgehog-like , bone morphogenetic protein 7b , megalin , and hedgehog interacting protein . likewise,  <dig> genes belonging to “wnt signalling”, which were members of the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity  pathway, or the wnt/ca2+ pathway, were negatively correlated with time of larval development. of particular interest are neuropilin- <dig> and transcription factor ap- <dig> alpha, genes that control the development and differentiation of the neural crest.

transcriptional changes across larval stage transitions
a two-class unpaired sam analysis was performed to identify transcriptional changes between two consecutive larval stages. the highest number of differentially expressed genes was found between  <dig> dph and  <dig> dph, with a total of  <dig>  significant genes , while only  <dig> genes  displayed a change in expression between  <dig> and  <dig> dph. to obtain a more comprehensive interpretation of the set of genes differentially expressed in each transition, enrichment analyses were performed using the software david . a complete list of biological process  go terms and kegg pathways that were found to be significantly enriched is reported in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
a total of  <dig> go-bp terms were found to be over-represented when  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae were compared; the majority  are related to the development of the neurological system and eye morphogenesis . strong over-expression of important photoreceptor components such as opsin  <dig> , arrestin  <dig> , retinal g protein  and rhodopsin  was identified in  <dig> dph larvae . a similar pattern can be observed also for key components of synapses and neurotransmitter release  such as nsf , calcium channel, voltage-dependent, l type, alpha 1d subunit , and solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> . analysis of enriched kegg terms confirmed these observations and identified “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”  as the most significant pathway .

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
the functional annotation of genes that were differentially expressed between  <dig> dph and  <dig> dph larvae resulted in the identification of  <dig> bp terms in common with the previous larval transition as significantly enriched, all of which are related to visual perception and neurological system processes , although the level of increase in expression was not identical to that in the previous comparison. among genes up-regulated in  <dig> dph compared to  <dig> dph larvae, several go terms are related to lipid metabolism , including key genes such as stearoyl-coa desaturase  and elovl family member  <dig> , which display significant over-expression. this evidence is supported by kegg analysis, which highlighted “steroid biosynthesis” and “ppar signalling pathway” as the most significantly enriched pathways.

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
the major evidence obtained when analyzing genes differentially expressed between  <dig> dph and  <dig> dph larvae is that all bp terms related to visual and neuronal processes remain enriched, although the corresponding genes display a significant down-regulation in stage  <dig> larvae . if the enrichment analysis is restricted only to genes up-regulated at  <dig> dph, the bp terms or kegg pathways that are found to be significantly enriched are mainly related to metabolism, particularly glucose metabolism . an heatmap of gene expression values across larval transitions is reported in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
the comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae yielded the lowest number of differentially expressed genes, with only  <dig> probes significant at fdr 1%. among the  <dig> transcripts, no kegg pathways and only a few bp terms were significantly enriched. the majority of significant terms  were related to visual and neuronal processes; however, genes belonging to these processes displayed low fold-changes and did not exhibit an univocal trend in expression .

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
the larval transition between  <dig> and  <dig> dph is also characterised by the significant down-regulation of all bp terms related to visual and neural processes. up-regulated genes include those involved in muscle morphogenesis and functioning , such as slow myosin heavy chain  <dig> , slow myosin heavy chain  <dig> , titin a  and titin b , which all displayed over-expression at  <dig> dph, with further increases over time .

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
statistical analysis of the entire set of gene expression values identified a close relationship between  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae; that in some cases  have also been grouped in the same cluster. however, functional analysis of differentially expressed genes identified an over-expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism  with several bp terms  more than 10-fold enriched . this finding is also supported by kegg pathway analysis, which identified “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” as the most significant term.

comparison of  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae
the comparison between  <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes, with  <dig> significantly enriched bp terms. a total of  <dig> biological processes related to cell division and chromosome organisation were represented by genes that were under-expressed at  <dig> dph compared to  <dig> dph. up-regulated genes are involved mainly in muscle cell development .

temporal expression of “hatching” enzymes
a recurrent annotation in genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated during larval stage transitions is “hatching enzyme”. in teleosts, several genes encoding hatching enzymes have been reported. in the common sole transcriptome, eight transcripts were found to encode a putative astacin-like metalloprotease. phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary position of these protein sequences was conducted by comparison with all available astacin-like metalloproteases from vertebrate genomes . two sole sequences  were classified as “true” hatching enzymes belonging to the groups high choriolytic enzymes  and low choriolytic enzymes , respectively  <cit> . the remaining putative proteins were clustered with a large group of paralogues, which include zebrafish nephrosin and several medaka astacin-like metalloproteases. the only exception is the protein encoded by transcript n_isotig <dig>  which has a basal position in the phylogenetic tree . as noted previously, the majority of these transcripts were found to be significantly down- or up-regulated during stage transitions in sole larvae . the expression profiles for sole lce  revealed basal expression without significant variations, while hce  showed a dramatic decrease  from  <dig> dph to  <dig> dph, as expected for enzymes that are secreted by the embryo to degrade chorion proteins for hatching. however, p_isotig <dig> displayed significantly increased expression  after completion of metamorphosis . five transcripts  are putative homologs of a group of medaka astacin-like proteins that were found to be expressed in epithelial layers of internal organs  in developing larvae and adults  <cit> . these transcripts display different patterns of expression . n_isotig <dig> displays a steady increase in expression over time from  <dig> to  <dig> dph, while n_isotig <dig> is characterised by mrna levels that decrease  from  <dig> to  <dig> dph, followed by a significant increase  until  <dig> dph and a new decline thereafter. p_isotig <dig> and p_isotig <dig>  appear to be expressed at very high levels and are characterised by an earlier significant up-regulation . the most interesting pattern, however, was observed for n_isotig <dig>  which displayed a steep up-regulation  during the transition between  <dig> and  <dig> dph, a peak at  <dig> dph  and a decline at  <dig> dph . n_isotig <dig> has no orthologues in any vertebrate genome, apart from an uncharacterised protein in stickleback and merits further study to characterise in greater detail its role during sole development.

expression of the trh, tsh and th receptors during larval development
in the present study, the gene expression profile of key transcripts of the th cascade was assessed. both thyrotropin releasing hormone  and thyrotropin  can be detected very early during larval development . trh mrna levels  increase significantly in the early stages of development, reaching a peak of expression at  <dig> dph  after the first feeding, followed by a reduction until metamorphosis is completed. a similar trend, although shifted forward, can be observed for thyrotropin, for which the tsh β transcript  displays a gradual increase in expression, with a peak at  <dig> dph . the expression pattern of iodothyronine deiodinase i , which controls the conversion of t <dig> to t <dig> as well as the inactive metabolite rt <dig>  was also assessed. after hatching, d <dig> expression  increased gradually until the end of metamorphosis  when it reached its highest level . ths indirectly regulate downstream gene transcription by binding to thyroid hormone receptors . in teleosts, two genes encoding trα  and two trβ have been reported  <cit> . in the present study, only thyroid hormone receptor α  was represented on the array; blast searches on sole transcripts failed to detect any putative trβ isoform. the expression profiles of the trα genes during larval development display a particular pattern with trαa and trαb characterized by an opposite trend . the trαa transcript  increases in expression until the onset of metamorphosis , at which point mrna levels are  <dig> -fold higher than at  <dig> dph, followed by a decrease in expression, while trαb  displays a higher level of expression from  <dig> to  <dig> dph, followed by a gradual decrease until  <dig> dph .

temporal expression of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-i system
in the present study, several factors belonging to the gh-igfi “axis” were identified and their gene expression was assessed during larval development. growth hormone , a protein involved in major physiological processes in the body, is characterised by a particular gene expression profile , with an increase in mrna levels from  <dig> dph to  <dig> dph , followed by a significant decrease at  <dig> dph  and a subsequent gradual increase until  <dig> dph . a similar pattern can be observed for growth hormone releasing hormone , although the second increase in gene expression levels began only at  <dig> dph . other molecules associated with gh, such as growth factor receptor-bound protein  <dig>  and grb2-associated-binding protein  <dig> , displayed no significant variation in expression across larval stages.

a completely different trend in gene expression was observed for igfi , for which mrna levels were relatively low during the initial stages , with a gradual increase from  <dig> dph . at later stages , gene expression levels are at least 10-fold higher compared to  <dig> dph . several igf-binding proteins  were also identified in the present study, with a heterogeneous assortment of expression profiles. igfbp <dig>  which is present as two isoforms, igfbp1a and igfbp1b, displayed an increase over time with a peak in expression at  <dig> dph . igfbp2a was characterised by an initial peak at  <dig> dph  and a second peak at  <dig> dph , while igfbp <dig> exhibited a decrease in expression at  <dig> dph , followed by an increase over time until  <dig> dph .

curved transcriptome landscape during flatfish development
as mentioned above, a distinctive pattern was observed in the distribution of samples along the second component  in the pca , in which the transcriptome landscape describes a marked curve as compared to the linear trend along the first component, which reflects temporal transitions across developmental stages. to further evaluate this observation, a sam quantitative correlation analysis was conducted to identify genes that significantly correlated with the projected position of individual samples along the y-axis. a total of  <dig> probes were positively correlated with y-axis position , i.e. up-regulated in 11-dph, 13-dph and, to a lesser extent, 6-dph larvae , and  <dig> probes were negatively correlated . similar results were obtained when considering two groups of samples, one including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dph larvae, the other  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dph larvae, in a sam two-class analysis . following a conservative approach, only genes that were found to be significant using both methods were considered further.

functional annotation of all significantly up-regulated and positively correlated genes  using david revealed that  <dig> go_bp terms were significantly enriched . among the most enriched pathways, two are related to metabolism of folic acid derivatives . genes belonging to these go terms include gtp cyclohydrolase  <dig>  whose product is a cofactor for tyrosine supply during melanogenesis  <cit> , and mthfd <dig>  1a), which plays a key role in de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis in humans  <cit> . nucleotide metabolism is also over-represented, with three terms related to nucleotide catabolic processes  that were approximately 10-fold enriched .

several go terms are linked to oxidative phosphorylation  and glycolysis . significant enrichment in cellular localisation was found for integral membrane proteins . concordant evidence was provided by go terms on molecular function . kegg pathway analysis revealed several enriched pathways. the most relevant were the “mevalonate pathway ”, a cellular pathway leading either to cholesterol synthesis or to protein lipidation and “arachidonic acid metabolism ” . several go terms as well as gene-specific annotations for positive/up-regulated genes suggested a putative role in liver and intestine function. to further explore this hypothesis, the list of significant genes was compared to transcripts that have been identified as specifically expressed in the developing gastrointestinal system of zebrafish larvae  <cit> . in that study, zebrafish larval cells were specifically sorted and analyzed using a zebrafish affymetrix microarray platform. of  <dig> sole-significant genes ,  <dig> corresponded to a putative zebrafish orthologue represented by affymetrix probes. these genes were matched against  <dig>  zebrafish genes that were found to be up-regulated in the developing gastrointestinal system of zebrafish. a highly significant overlap was found , with  <dig> transcripts shared between the two sets. also of note is the presence of several genes involved in the scavenging of oxygen radical species  and mitochondrial carriers.

two genes involved in retinol metabolism were also included in the list of significant transcripts. bcox, a provitamin a-converting enzyme with a role in zebrafish embryogenesis and pigmentation  <cit> , displayed the most striking profile, with a peak at  <dig> dph. the second protein was retinol binding protein  <dig> , an intracellular chaperone for retinol and retinal, which is involved in the intestinal absorption of vitamin a as well as in modulating the supply of retinoic acid in specific cell types. rbp <dig> displays a different expression profile, with an initial peak at  <dig> dph and a second, less marked, at  <dig> dph. notably, among the up-regulated and positively-correlated genes was a key regulator of morphogenesis . a smaller set of genes  were found to be down-regulated as well as negatively correlated with the second pca component . functional annotation with david highlighted tight junction and cell-cell adhesion as kegg pathways significantly enriched. members of these pathways include claudin  <dig> , claudin 7b  and occludin b , all significantly down-regulated on 6-11- <dig> dph compared to previous and later stages. in this context, vitronectin a , integrin, alpha-v  and calpain- <dig> , genes that play a role in focal adhesion and ecm-receptor interactions, were also identified as significant.

real-time rt-pcr validation
a set of  <dig> genes was assessed by rt-qpcr to validate the microarray platform performance. this set of genes was chosen among those involved in key pathways of s. solea larval development and displaying, in the present study, different patterns of expression across stages.

three genes, bcox, rbp <dig> and claudin 7b, were correlated  to sample projection on the pca y-axis and were either down-  or up-regulated  in pre-metamorphic larvae compared to previous and later stages. three genes, megalin, sonic hedgehog-like and aldolase a, are members of key pathways of larval development  and displayed expression levels that were positively  or negatively  correlated with time of larval development. the latter four genes, tshβ, trh, gh and igf <dig>  are members of the th and gh/igf <dig> cascades and displayed different patterns of expression across larval stages.

a spearman rank-correlation test was used to assess the correlation between expression values measured by rt-qpcr and by microarray in a total of  <dig> experiments . table  <dig> indicates the correlation coefficients calculated for the validated genes. all genes displayed high correlation coefficients between microarray and rt-qpcr, with spearman’s rho  <dig>  < rho <  <dig>  , thus confirming a strong positive correlation between the two technologies.

discussion
the continuous development of advanced next-generation sequencing  technologies and their competitive costs have resulted in their use for a wide range of applications, included genome and transcriptome sequencing of non-model species. to date, only limited transcriptome-wide studies on fish larvae have been conducted in teleost species  <cit> , and only one study has been conducted in flatfish , a group of great interest because it undergoes a dramatic larval-to-juvenile transition compared to other fish species. the present study is the first to characterise gene expression profiles during metamorphosis of solea solea, a flatfish species of relevance for mediterranean aquaculture. the use of  <dig> pyrosequencing produced a large set of good quality reads that were then assembled into a significant number of isotigs. the combined approach used in this study allowed the annotation of a high percentage  of sole isotigs, considerably higher than the value observed in similar studies on other fish species . annotated transcripts were then employed for the construction of an oligo-dna microarray in order to investigate the transcriptome variation during s. solea larval development. the variety of biological processes that were found to be differentially expressed between time points reveals the complexity of transcriptome regulation during larval ontogenesis. changes in gene expression reflect processes related mainly to organogenesis  and the maturation of essential physiological functions . analysis of differentially expressed genes during stage transitions delineated the main processes involved in organogenesis and larval growth.

development of visual perception is essential for larval feeding. the eye of indirectly developing species is often slightly pigmented or non-pigmented at hatching and is most likely non-functional. in most species, the eye becomes fully pigmented and functional within the first week after hatching  <cit> . functional annotation of differentially expressed genes revealed a strong up-regulation of bps related to visual perception during the early stages of larval development . many genes associated with eye morphogenesis were found to be up-regulated until  <dig> dph, while an opposite trend was observed from  <dig> dph and thereafter, suggesting that this stage represents the turning point for eye development. pitx <dig> , a gene involved in anterior eye segment development, displayed higher expression levels at  <dig> and  <dig> dph. opsin  and rhodopsin transcripts, primary light sensors of retinal photoreceptors  <cit> , as well as retinal arrestin, which is involved in signal transduction, displayed a strong up-regulation at  <dig> and  <dig> dph. in the literature, all these genes are reported to be regulated by vitamin a  <cit> . vitamin a  is indispensable for eye morphogenesis  <cit>  and exerts its biological function through its metabolite, retinoic acid , a signal molecule important for photoreceptor development in vertebrates. in the present study, kegg pathway analysis highlighted “retinol metabolism”  as significantly enriched  at  <dig> and  <dig> dph. many genes that play a crucial role in ra synthesis and transport, such as rdh <dig> , raldh <dig> , crabp  and crbp , displayed high levels of expression at the earliest larval stages, followed by a decrease over time, supporting the hypothesis that ra is mainly produced in specific temporal windows  <cit> . retinoic acid treatment influences photoreceptor development in zebrafish and has been reported to up-regulate the transcription of several photoreceptor-specific genes  <cit> , as it was observed for opsins and arrestin in the present study. through in situ hybridisation of different opsin cdnas on single cones expressing either blue-, green- or red-sensitive opsin, prabhudesai and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that, in zebrafish, exposure to endogenous ra differentially regulates gene transcription on specific photoreceptors with a simultaneous increase in the expression of rod opsin and red cone opsin and a decrease in the expression of blue and uv cone opsins. the results obtained in the present study were not in agreement with this evidence, as both red-, green- and blue-sensitive opsins were up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dph, with green-sensitive opsins displaying the highest expression levels . however, this inconsistency may be due to the methods applied for assessing the expression of different opsin sets because, to be comparable, the microarray analysis should have been performed on single photoreceptors already committed to a specific phenotype rather than globally. taken together, all the above evidence clearly indicate that genes involved in the ontogenesis of the visual system are up-regulated during early stages of larval development , further confirming that the eye is still developing during this larval period.

many genes related to muscle development and function increased over time , and the corresponding bps were significantly enriched  during the transition from  <dig> to  <dig> dph larvae and later stages. caveolin  <dig> is involved in zebrafish muscle precursor differentiation, and cav <dig> knockout mice exhibit a mild muscular dystrophy phenotype  <cit> . the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor- <dig>  is important for all types of embryonic muscle differentiation and, in drosophila, plays an essential role in adult myogenesis by participating in the control of myoblast fusion and in myofibrillogenesis in developing myotubes  <cit> . galectin- <dig> promotes skeletal muscle differentiation in human foetal mesenchymal cells  <cit>  and has been shown to be involved in muscle regeneration. titin a is required for sarcomere assembly and is considered a molecular marker for cardiomyocyte differentiation  <cit> . these data are in agreement with those obtained for the european seabass  <cit>  and the atlantic halibut  <cit>  and reflect the progressive development of muscle during larval ontogenesis. post-embryonic growth is associated with both hypertrophy  and hyperplasia  from undifferentiated myoblasts or myosatellite cells  <cit> . gene expression analysis alone is not sufficient to discriminate between those two mechanisms of muscle growth without the support of other analyses , however our findings are in agreement with previous studies conducted in fish  <cit>  where it is reported that the mechanism of muscle development during fish larval growth is mainly related to stratified hyperplasia, which is responsible for the increase in number of muscle fibers.

a clear correspondence was also observed between muscle development and energy metabolism. energy metabolism in early fish larvae is almost entirely aerobic. the anaerobic power of muscle fibres is low after hatching but increases during the transition from larva to juvenile  <cit> . fish larvae primarily use dietary lipids and proteins as their first energetic sources. this is reflected by the sole gene expression profiles, in which many genes involved in proteolysis and lipid metabolism are up-regulated at the mouth-opening stage . this energy production pathway is masked in later stages by the increase in the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism , with several bp terms and kegg pathways significantly enriched at  <dig> dph. of particular interest, the gene expression of lactate dehydrogenase , the enzyme that catalyses the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate when oxygen is absent , increased gradually, with fold-changes of 29-fold  and 58-fold  for ldh-a  and ldh-b , respectively. this finding further confirms a previous study by darias and coworkers  <cit>  that suggested a relationship between glucose metabolism and the development of white muscle fibres, in which the anaerobic energy necessary for swimming is mainly supplied by the glycolytic pathway.

coordinated expression of the th cascade during larval metamorphosis
thyroid hormones  are among the most prominent factors controlling vertebrate development and metabolism in adult animals. in particular, 5′,3′, <dig> -tetraiodothyronine  and 3′, <dig> -triiodothyronine  are widely reported to play a key role in larval development and fish metamorphosis  <cit> . flatfish metamorphosis is a th-driven process, and numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of these hormones for metamorphosis-associated tissue modifications  <cit> . the start of metamorphosis has been associated with a surge in ths in which th levels increase until the metamorphic climax and decrease post-climax  <cit> . japanese flounder  and atlantic halibut  metamorphosis has been proven to be induced precociously by th treatment and, conversely, to be delayed or abolished following exposure to agents that inhibit th synthesis  <cit> . several studies have assessed the expression profiles of genes belonging to the thyroid-pituitary axis in flatfish, although focusing on a single gene or a few genes without a global view of the whole gene network. in the present study, both trh and tshβ transcripts were detected; however, these genes exhibited slightly different expression patterns during development. trh reached its maximum of expression at  <dig> dph, while the tshβ peak was shifted forward to  <dig> dph. these findings are in good agreement with those previously reported for the senegalese sole  <cit>  and other fish species  <cit> . temporal regulation of mrna levels is coherent with the role of trh, which promotes the synthesis and release of tsh. tsh in turn acts on the thyroid follicles by inducing iodothyronine deionidase activity  <cit> , which ultimately leads to the synthesis of t <dig> and t <dig>  which display higher concentrations at the climax of metamorphosis. only slight changes in iodothyronine deionidase i  expression occurred during the pre-metamorphosis stages, with an initial peak in expression at  <dig> dph  and strong up-regulation at  <dig> dph . d <dig> has been reported to play a double role in th synthesis by i) activating t <dig> by producing the more active t <dig> and ii) inactivating t <dig> by producing the metabolite rt <dig>  <cit> . the peak of expression observed at  <dig> dph appears to be in better agreement with the inactivating function of d <dig>  with a possible role in decreasing circulating levels of ths after metamorphosis.

higher vertebrates commonly possess two principal tr isoforms, namely, trα and trβ, and two genes encoding trα  have been found in different fish species  <cit>  as a result of the whole genome duplication that occurred during teleost evolution  <cit> . to date, two trβ genes have been reported only in conger myriaster <cit> . in this study, two transcripts encoding trα genes were identified, and their expression in common sole is similar to what has been reported during metamorphosis in halibut  <cit>  and gilthead seabream  <cit>  and suggests a correlation between th levels and trαa. this evidence supports the hypothesis postulated by galay-burgos  <cit>  that trαa is itself a th-inducible gene.

role of the gh/igfi system during sole larval development
the growth hormone  - insulin-like growth factor-i  system is widely recognised for its importance in the regulation of growth and development in fish by participating in the determination of both physiological processes and behavioural aspects  <cit> . during the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the physiological role of the gh/igf system in developmental processes of fish. although several studies have investigated the role of key components of the gh/igfi axis in fish growth  <cit> , there is no information on the temporal regulation of corresponding mrna levels during larval development and metamorphosis. in the present study, analysis of the mrna levels of gh, ghrh, igfi, igf1r and igfbps revealed a trend in expression coherent with their postulated role in the gh pathway. the cascade of events by which gh induces its biological function begins when gh, whose expression is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone , binds to specific gh receptors  and in turn stimulates igfi synthesis in the liver  <cit> .

in the atlantic halibut, the gh-igfi system is established at the start of autonomous feeding  <cit> . in the common sole, ghrh and gh display similar expression patterns, with a significant up-regulation before metamorphosis onset , followed by a decrease in mrna levels until  <dig> dph and a then subsequent increase  at  <dig> dph. up-regulation of igfi and igfr <dig> appears to be concurrent with the decrease in gh mrna levels. this evidence is in agreement with the hypothesis that igfi synthesis acts as a mediator of a negative feedback mechanism by inhibiting gh transcription as already demonstrated in different fish species  . other key components of the gh/igfi pathways are igfbps. in the present study, igfbp mrnas displayed lower expression in pre-metamorphosis stages, then gradually increased and reached a peak at metamorphosis climax  or later . in the japanese flounder, there is evidence that igfbps play an important role in regulating the activity of igfs during larval development and metamorphosis  <cit> . in zebrafish in vivo expression of igfbp <dig> has been reported to cause growth and developmental retardation  <cit> . in the common sole, down-regulation of igfbp- <dig> mrna and increased expression of igfi mrna were observed during metamorphosis, followed by an inversion of this trend after metamorphosis. this observation is in agreement with the need for igfi-mediated stimulation of pre-metamorphic larval growth and initiation of metamorphosis; once metamorphosis is completed, igfi function is negatively regulated via a reduction in its mrna levels and sequestration of circulating igfi by igfbps.

the potential regulatory effects of th on igfi expression remain to be fully clarified. in fish, t <dig> and t <dig> have been shown to induce hepatic igfi expression. in zebrafish and tilapia, t <dig> induces igfi transcription both in vitro and in vivo <cit>  and in mice, t <dig>  in the presence of thrα, binds to a th response element in intron  <dig> of the igfi gene to stimulate its transcription  <cit> . these phenomena are in agreement with the gene expression profiles of both s. solea igfi transcripts, which show a significant increase in mrna levels at 13– <dig> dph, simultaneous with a peak in thrαa expression. in the present study, however, th levels were not assessed.

morphological modifications that subtend eye migration during flatfish metamorphosis are controversial. saele and coworkers  <cit>  propose that bone remodelling and fibroblast proliferation drive atlantic halibut eye migration, while a recent study by bao et al.  <cit>  assumes that in different fish species  the initial migration of the eye is caused by cell proliferation in the suborbital tissue of the blind side and that the twist of frontal bone is dependent on eye migration. recent studies  have proposed that the gh-igfi system participates in cranial remodelling during halibut metamorphosis as key tissue/cell types  have been proven to be sensitive to gh and igf <dig> during metamorphosis. the expression profiles of sole genes involved in the gh/igfi pathway, particularly igfi and igf1r, appear to support such a hypothesis, despite the fact that, in the present study, transcriptomic data were obtained from whole larvae without tissue-specific information.

transcriptomic landscape in pre-metamorphic larvae
although the initiation of lateral asymmetry and eye migration was only observed in  <dig> dph larvae of common sole, it is likely that transcriptional changes occur before phenotypic modifications become evident. in this respect, pca analysis clearly indicated a specific clustering along the second component for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae, compared to all earlier and later developmental stages. considering the large number of differentially expressed transcripts, it is likely that key transcriptomic events occur between  <dig> and  <dig> dph. the majority of significant genes appear to be related to the development of epithelial layers and digestive organs, a process that might be only indirectly involved in metamorphosis. however, a few enriched kegg pathways that were observed in the same stages are suggestive of additional developmental processes. the “mevalonate pathway”, which was found to be significantly enriched in up-regulated genes, leads either to cholesterol synthesis or to protein lipidation, both processes that are relevant during development . similarly, the significant enrichment of the “arachidonic acid pathway” and, in particular, prostaglandin e <dig> -synthase can be linked to developmental processes, as pge <dig> has been shown to be involved in the morphogenesis of several organs.

as mentioned previously, the molecular mechanisms underlying flatfish metamorphosis are still under debate, and eye migration and external asymmetry are apparently a separate process from somatic growth and organogenesis  <cit> . a recent study  <cit>  hypothesised that flounder eye-sidedness is controlled by the nodal-lefty-pitx <dig>  pathway, in which pre-metamorphic pitx <dig> re-expression on the left side habenula drives eye lateralisation by stimulating cell proliferation. in the present study, pitx <dig>  displayed reduced mrna levels over time, with no peaks in pre-metamorphic stages. however, it should be emphasised that gene expression was assessed in whole larvae , and the observed decrease in expression could arise from the decrease in habenula/whole body tissue mass ratio that occurs during larval development. bao and colleagues  <cit>  reported that initial migration of the eye in flatfish is caused by fibroblast proliferation in the suborbital tissue of the blind side. once the eye receives sufficient pushing force from proliferating cells to overcome the main counteracting force from the other eye, it begins migrating upwards. single-cell and collective migration are known to occur during morphogenesis, tissue regeneration and in pathological conditions. in particular, collective cell migration is essential in building, shaping, and remodelling complex tissues and tissue compartments. cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion, cytoskeletal polarity and rigidity, and pericellular proteolysis interdependently control migration mode and efficiency  <cit> . interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix  are essential for the control of tissue remodelling and cell migration because the ecm provides the substrate as well as a barrier towards the advancing cell body. motility is limited by the turnover rates of adhesion and de-adhesion events, yielding an inverse relationship between contact strength and migration rates. at the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialised structures known as focal adhesions are formed, in which actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family. focal adhesion can be controlled by modulation of integrin expression levels, degradation of ecm structures by proteases, and focal contact disassembly by cytoskeletal reorganisation . in this context, interesting findings arose from the identification of genes that were differentially expressed in pre-metamorphic s. solea larvae. functional annotation and kegg pathway analyses revealed that “focal adhesion”  and “tight junction”  were differentially expressed in pre-metamorphic stages and  <dig> dph larvae. vitronectin a , a cell adhesion factor found in serum and ecm that is recognised by certain members of the integrin family and serves as a cell-to-substrate adhesion molecule, was found to be down-regulated in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dph larvae compared to previous and later stages. several components of tight junctions displayed a similar pattern of expression. members of the claudin family , which in some cases have been reported to have a role in adhesion to ecm and inhibition of cell motility in human cancer  <cit> , were under-expressed in pre-metamorphic stages. similar evidence was observed for the transcript encoding occludin b .

an opposite trend was observed for matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  and collagenase mt1-mmp, both reported by friedl and coworker  <cit>  to play a key role in ecm degradation during cell migration. mmp <dig> was up-regulated at 11-18- <dig> dph, while mt1-mmp was over-expressed at 18– <dig> dph. another group of metalloproteases that is potentially involved in pre- and early metamorphosis stages is that represented by astacin-like metallo-endopeptidase. astacin-like zinc-metalloproteases, also known as hatching enzymes, are widely present in egg-laying animals and play a key role in degrading chorion proteins to release the developing embryo. as reported above, a significant increase in expression from  <dig> dph was observed for three members of this family, encoded by transcripts n_isotig <dig>  p_isotig <dig> and p_isotig <dig> . evolutionary analysis of astacin-like metalloproteases in the medaka and zebrafish genomes  <cit>  demonstrated that one or two genes represent bona fide “hatching enzymes”, while the rest are paralogous copies of still unclear function. a recent study  <cit>  revealed that these proteins are involved in mouse and chicken embryogenesis and organogenesis, mostly in remodelling epithelia. whether astacin-like metallo-endopeptidases have a similar role in the common sole and, more specifically, in promoting cellular/tissue migration through ecm reorganisation during early development represents an interesting topic for further studies.

finally, coordinated changes in the actin cytoskeleton as well as the actin-myosin interaction provide the force for cellular motility. in the present study, both α-actin and myosin light-chain displayed increased levels of expression at  <dig> dph and thereafter. the over-expression of these genes could be simply related to muscle development, which occurs during the same stages; however, a role in molecular mechanisms of cell migration and, more generally, in tissue rearrangement cannot be excluded.

in conclusion, despite the limitations of gene expression analysis on whole larvae, including the absence of cell- or tissue-specific information and the potential signal dilution of scarcely represented transcripts, the characterisation of the larval sole transcriptome permitted a global view of the main molecular mechanisms underlying physiological and morphological changes during the larval-to-juvenile transition. in particular, the observation of a peculiar shape in the transcriptomic landscape of 6– <dig> dph larvae and the analysis of genes involved in such phenomenon indicated molecular pathways and gene networks that might be critical for the profound phenotypical changes that occur during flatfish metamorphosis.

CONCLUSIONS
with the advent of novel methods for high-throughput dna sequencing such as  <dig> pyrosequencing technology, genomic resources are gradually becoming more affordable for the study of non-model species for whom this type of knowledge remains limited. the development of different ‘omic’ technologies is thus enhancing the knowledge of the complex genetic control underlying different physiological processes of flatfishes. in the present study, the transcriptome of the common sole, a flatfish species of great interest for european aquaculture, was sequenced for the first time, and a microarray platform for gene expression profiling is now available. gene expression analysis of developmental stages permitted the delineation of the main mechanisms underlying physiological and morphological changes during the larval-to-juvenile transition. the large variety of biological processes found to be differentially expressed between time points reveals the complexity of transcriptome regulation during larval ontogenesis. the detailed analysis of the transcriptomic landscape of pre-metamorphic larvae indicates molecular pathways and gene networks that might be critical for the profound phenotypical changes that occur during flatfish metamorphosis.
