BACKGROUND
side effects are unwanted responses to drug treatment, and they are important resources of human phenotype information. drugs bind to target proteins and affect biological processes, and the processes cause phenotype effect. however, drugs may also bind to off-target proteins, which affects other biological processes and causes adverse reactions . side effects occur mainly when drugs bind to unintended off-targets. these side effects vary from simple symptoms, such as headache, to critical symptoms, such as carcinoma. most side effects are harmful to humans, but side effects can also be utilized to find new uses for known drugs, such as viagra. therefore, it is highly desirable to automatically discover new targets for known drugs and to understand the mechanisms that cause side effects for target-specific treatments.

in their paper published in science, campellos et al reported finding new targets based on drugs with similar side effects  <cit> . they used an abc network model built with  drugs developed for new targets,  targets, and  side effects. similarly, keiser used chemical similarity to find new targets for a known drug  <cit> . keiser’s approach enabled the discovery of off-targets of a known drug but did not consider the relationship between a drug and its biological process.

like keiser’s and campellos’s studies, most previous research was focused mostly on finding off-target proteins causing the side effects. in addition, the biological processes that are affected by the drug target need to be considered because they cause phenotypical responses in the human biological system. a drug that influences biological processes can also have an impact on phenotype. therefore, if the biological process that responds to a drug influencing the phenotype is known then drugs pertinent to the phenotype can be studied more effectively and systematically. to date, the relationships between biological processes and side effects have not been systematically researched.

two databases are available for studying relationships between side effects and biological processes: the connectivity map and side effects resource . the connectivity map is developed to generate and analyze a drug-gene-disease network from large-scale experimental gene expression responses to drugs  <cit> . sider is a recently developed database on side effects to document the relationship between drugs and side effects  <cit> . the connectivity map provides drug-responsive gene expression information, and sider provides drug-side effect relationships.

by utilizing the connectivity map and sider, we aimed to automatically discover the relationship between biological processes and side effects by building a multi-level network of drug-biological processes influenced by the association of targets with side effects.

gene ontology  terms were used for biological processes, and gene set enrichment scores  were used to find which processes were upregulated or downregulated by the drugs. subsequently, an abc network model was built  to find relationships between side effects and biological processes . the results show that many processes found in the drug-process network were meaningful and were confirmed by previous studies. in addition, a novel network consisting of  <dig> effects and  <dig>  biological processes was constructed, and these relationships based on the abc model were also confirmed to be significant by support from the literature. finally, evaluations were conducted in  <dig> ways: first, by quantifying how many biological processes were found by our method and were concurrently found in go terms with effects extracted from the pubmed records using a text-mining technique and second, whether there was an improvement in performance by limiting response processes by drugs sharing the same side effect to frequent ones alone. the experimental results showed that our process-drug-side effect network was able to reveal meaningful relationships between biological processes and side effects in an efficient manner.

in addition to comprehensive evaluation, our method contributes to systematically finding relationships between drugs and biological processes using es scores calculations, t-score calculation, and threshold-based filtering. second, side effect-related biological processes are revealed by merging the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. finally, data on  <dig> drugs,  <dig> effects, and  <dig> biological process relation resources were generated.

datasets and methods
to discover the relationships between side effects and biological processes,  <dig> networks were constructed: the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. side effect and biological process relationships were automatically revealed by connecting the  <dig> networks.

drug-biological process network construction
connectivity map
a connectivity map was used to construct a drug-responsive process database. the connectivity map is a collection of genome-wide transcriptional expression data from cultured human cells treated with bioactive small molecules <cit> . the connectivity map contains  <dig>  expression profiles representing  <dig>  compounds. the connectivity map provided rank information of probes for each sample. there were  <dig>  probes and  <dig>  samples in the rank matrix. probe sets in ranked matrix were ranked in descending order of the ratio of the corresponding treatment-to-control values. therefore, “top rank” means probes that are more highly upregulated than the control; “bottom rank” means probes that are more highly downregulated than the control. top rank genes are positively affected by drugs, and bottom rank genes are negatively affected by drugs.

gene ontology
go was used as a resource for biological processes. the go project provided term definitions representing gene product properties in  <dig> categories  <cit> : cellular component, molecular function, and biological processes

gene set enrichment analysis
gene set enrichment analysis  was used to show the relationship of processes to drugs. gsea is a gene expression profile analysis technique used for finding the significance of a function, pathway, or go category  <cit> .

in this approach, gene sets s i = { <dig> …,n} are defined by go terms and ranking information of each gene l j = { <dig> …,k} from the connectivity map. the ess of each gene set were calculated in  <dig>  samples. ess of upregulated processes were calculated based on the ranked list; ess of downregulated processes were calculated using the reversed ranked list.

   <cit> 

cij is defined as a summing factor of a gene gj that is drawn from l. n is the number of total genes in l, and ns is the number of genes in the gene set si.

then the running sum sumij for each sample against gene j is calculated using the following equation:  

the es for gene set i was calculated as follows:  

es is the maximum deviation from zero of sumij. for a randomly distributed gene set, si, esi will be relatively small, but if it is concentrated at the top or the bottom of the list, or otherwise non-randomly distributed, then esi will be correspondingly high.

process significance calculation
a t-score was used to show the significance of each process. to get a normalized t-score robust to outliers, the ess were standardized with the median-mad normalization method for each process  <cit> . esij was used to denote an es of process i = { <dig> ,…p} from sample j = { <dig> ,…,n}.  

both medi and madi were used to represent the median, and the median absolute deviation of enrichment scores for biological process i. the scale factor of  <dig>  in the above equation was used to make madi an estimator of σ.

drug-side effect network construction
side effect resource 
sider was developed to discover the relationships between side effects and drugs, and sider connects  <dig> drugs to  <dig>  types of side effects  <cit> . it contains frequency of occurrence information between drugs and side effects for one-third of the drug-side effect pairs. 


a search tool for interactions of chemicals  id is represented as a compound id in stitch databases. a unified medical language system  concept id implies a description of frequency that consists of  <dig> types: postmarketing, rare, infrequent, and frequent. for frequent cases, a percentage is used instead of the word “frequent.”


drug-side effect network construction
drug-side effect relationships available in sider are incomplete because side effects do not occur in gene expression data every time. therefore, drug-side effect relationships appearing in sider needed to be filtered to find highly occurring relationships of gene expression data. among the  <dig>  common drug-side effect relationships in sider, however, only  <dig>  relations have a frequency higher than 5%. most relations had no information about frequency. twenty percent was set as a threshold of frequency to find drug-side effect relationships . finally,  <dig>  filtered relations were used to construct the drug-side effect network.

biological process-side effect network construction
lastly, the biological process-side effect network was built. figure  <dig> shows the method used for finding relationships between side effects and biological processes. the hypothesis used was that frequent responses to drugs causing the same side effect have higher probabilities of correlation with a side effect than less frequent responses.

connecting drug-process and drug-side effect networks
to find relationships between biological processes and side effects, drug information was used as a bridge between the  <dig> networks, the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. this can be represented as an abc model consisting of a, biological processes; b, drugs; and c, side-effects. to merge the  <dig> networks, the drug names needed to be normalized because the connectivity map and sider use different drug identification. drugbank was used to obtain normalized drug information for  <dig>  fda-approved drugs. the file “drugcards.zip” was downloaded from the drugbank  <cit> . three fields, i.e., drug id, synonym, and brand names, were used to normalize drug names between the ab network and the bc network. because of the small number of side effects with frequency information, only  <dig> drugs were included in both the ab and bc networks. finally, using the  <dig> drugs with  <dig> effects and  <dig>  processes network, data on  <dig>  relationships were generated.

to illustrate the construction of the side effect-biological process network, the example of tamoxifen was used. tamoxifen is one of drugs present in both the drug-process network and the drug-side effect network, and it is used as a mediator to connect the  <dig> networks .

discovering side effect-related processes from the drug-process-side effect network
co-occurrence-based scoring was used to determine how many drugs shared the same side effect in each process. a biological process that has a high co-occurrence score implies that the process is closely related to the targeted side effect; therefore, side effect data are only used when at least  <dig> drugs are related.

scoreij was used to denote the co-occurrence score of a process i = { <dig> ,…n} in a side effect j = { <dig> ,…,n}. for each side effect i = { <dig> ,..n}, cdij is used to represent the number of drugs that have the co-occurring process i related to a side effect j, and tdj is used to represent the number of total drugs related to the side effect j.  

in the drug-process-side effect network, nausea is the most common side effect and is connected to  <dig> drugs. to investigate how many drugs with the same processes were significant, drug-side effect relations were randomly generated. the processes were determined by randomly selecting  <dig> drugs  for each side effect, repeated  <dig>  times. the distribution was then determined using the number of related drugs on processes, and the processes with a p-value less than  <dig>  were analyzed.

evaluation method
the constructed network was evaluated by examining the significance of relationships between biological processes and side effects provided by the network. the significance of relationships was measured by comparing biological processes represented by go terms with the co-occurrence of go terms and effect names appearing in pubmed records. the first and second steps were used to calculate the co-occurrence of effect names and go terms. first, a set of pubmed records with an effect name was used as a query. the “” qualifier was used in the pubmed search to ensure that effect names appeared in abstracts or titles. secondly, because it is not easy to extract noun phrases from go terms by using a simple exact string match, significant phrases were used. to this end, the following text-mining techniques were used: a conditional random field -based sentence segmentation technique was used to parse abstracts  <cit> , the sentence was tokenized with the part-of-speech  technique using an extension of the brill pos tagger  <cit> , and noun phrase groups were extracted with a text chunking technique  <cit>  that specialized in biomedical data collections. thirdly, the extracted noun phrases were compared with go terms, and the number of matched phrases was stored along with the phrases. the comparison between extracted phrases and go terms was based on string similarity between the  <dig>  and the shortest path-based edit distance  technique  <cit>  was used. the sped technique is a variation of markov random field-based edit distance  and calculates the shortest path between  <dig> selected vertices of a graph. various thresholds were tested for string similarities, and the threshold was set at  <dig>  since it gave the best performance. table  <dig> shows the number of abstracts found in pubmed and the total go terms evaluated for rash and urinary tract infection ;  <dig>  go terms were utilized to calculate co-occurrence scores for evaluation.

RESULTS
the goodness of the discovered relations was confirmed using a survey of literature. first, the drug-biological process network was analyzed using the tamoxifen case study to show the significance of our method. secondly, the abc network model for a, processes; b, drugs; and c, side-effects was analyzed to find relationships between side effects and biological processes. two case studies are used as examples to show the meaningfulness of the network. finally, the performance of the network was evaluated by comparing the number of matched go terms extracted by a text-mining method that was applied to a large number of pubmed abstracts.

drug-biological process network
the network connects  <dig>  drugs to  <dig>  go terms with its es. the go terms are varied and some go terms are too broad to interpret the relations; therefore, go terms with less than  <dig> genes in human were chosen.  highly relevant go terms with a t-score greater than  <dig>   were also chosen. a positive association is more upregulated than the control; a negative association is more downregulated than the control.

case study—tamoxifen-related biological processes in the constructed network
for the case study of the drug-process network, tamoxifen was chosen because of its well-known mechanism. tamoxifen is an antagonist of estrogen receptors in breast tissue  <cit> .  we use 143th instance in connectivity map to find relationships between tamoxifen and its related processes in this case.

biological process-side effect network
the biological process-side effect network contains  <dig>  biological process-side effect pairs and covers a total of  <dig> side effects and  <dig>  processes. in this network, there are  <dig>  upregulated biological process-side effect pairs with a total of  <dig> side effects and  <dig>  processes . furthermore, there are  <dig>  downregulated biological process-side effect pairs,  <dig> side effects, and  <dig>  processes . figure 6a shows the statistics of upregulated processes. to apply our algorithm, the side effects of more than  <dig> drug need to be considered. we finally used  <dig> effects and  <dig> processes with  <dig> relations. 

case study—nausea-related biological processes in the biological processes-side effect network
in the case study of nausea, the most common cause is gastroenteritis or food poisoning, but nausea also frequently occurs as a medication side effect. nausea is connected to  <dig> drugs in the drug-side effect network. for random sampling analysis, a score greater than or equal to  <dig>  was considered significant .

case study—anemia-related biological processes in the biological processes-side effect network
anemia is known as deficiency of hemoglobin, which is a molecular substance inside red blood cells. as hemoglobin transfers oxygen from lungs to the tissues, anemia makes hypoxia in tissues. anemia is connected to  <dig> drugs in the drug-side effect network. a random sampling analysis score greater than or equal to  <dig>  was considered significant .

evaluation result
two different side effects, i.e., rash, and uti, were used for evaluation by retrieving pubmed records for each side effect and calculating the co-occurrence scores for each go term. figure  <dig> shows the co-occurrence scores for each go term for  <dig> cases. to evaluate the significance of discovered biological processes, the top 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% scores in the distribution were selected, as shown in figure  <dig>  this threshold was used to examine the significance of the processes in each top n%.

for rash, our method showed  <dig> go-related terms. of  <dig> processes,  <dig> were found in the top 10% of the text-mining results,  <dig> processes were found in the top 20% of the results,  <dig> processes were found in the top 30% of the results,  <dig> processes were found in the top 40% of the results, and  <dig> processes were in the top 50% of the results. for uti, our method shows  <dig> go-related terms. of  <dig> processes,  <dig> were found in the top 10% of the results,  <dig> were found in the top 20% of the results,  <dig> were found in the top 30% of the text-mining results,  <dig> were found in the top 40% of the results, and  <dig> processes were in the top 50% of the results.

it was assumed that more frequent responsive processes to drugs causing the same side effect have higher probabilities of correlation with a side effect than less frequent responsive processes. the hypothesis was tested with rash and uti cases. in figure 9a, the rash <dig> bar  includes less frequent response processes, and the rash <dig> bar  includes only significant frequent response processes. for the rash <dig> bar, we found  <dig> related processes. eleven processes  were found in the top 10% of the text-mining results,  <dig>  were in the top 20% of the results,  <dig>  were in the top 30% of the results,  <dig>  were in the top 40% of the results, and  <dig> processes  were in the top 50% of the results. the rash <dig> bar shows  <dig> significant frequent response processes by drugs. two processes  were in the top 10%,  <dig>  were in the top 20%,  <dig>  were in the top 30%,  <dig>  were in the top 40%, and  <dig> processes  were in the top 50%. for all results, except 40%, rash <dig> performs better than rash <dig> in terms of the proportion of processes discovered over the top n ranked processed .

in figure 9b, the uti <dig> bar  includes less frequent response processes, and the uti <dig> bar  only includes significant frequent response processes. for the uti <dig> bar, our method found  <dig> related processes. seven processes  were found in the top 10%,  <dig>  were found in the top 20% of the results,  <dig>  were found in the top 30%,  <dig>  were found in the top 40%, and  <dig> processes  were found in the top 50%. as indicated by the uti <dig> bar, our method found  <dig> frequent response processes by drugs. one process  was found in the top 10%,  <dig> processes  in the top 20%, 30%, and 40%, and  <dig> processes  in the top 50% of the results. this shows that uti <dig> performed better than uti <dig> in all  <dig> cases  and confirms that our method was able to find relationships between biological processes and side effects.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we proposed a new approach for automatically discovering relationships between biological processes and side effects using the co-occurrence based multi-level network. we built the drug-biological process network, and showed that our method can be used to discover drug related significant processes . in addition, we built an abc model  for  <dig> drugs,  <dig> side effects, and  <dig>  biological processes. a literature analysis confirmed that relations between side effects and biological processes found by co-occurrence were meaningful. in addition, our method was evaluated using a text-mining technique to extract co-occurring go terms with effects. the results showed that our method is efficient and useful for finding relationships between biological processes and side effects.

in a future study, the scoring scheme will be improved because the current scoring algorithm considers all drugs equally regardless of the number of side effects or the number of biological processes associated with them. for example, drug a has only  <dig> side effect , whereas drug b has  <dig> side effects , with all other settings the same, including association with biological process . in this case, drug a provides more reliable information on the association of s1and p than drug b. however, the proposed scoring scheme cannot reflect this, thus causing a loss of information for a more accurate association. we also plan to investigate whether biological processes related to side effects are valuable resources in elucidating the mechanism of drug effects. instead of using the text-mining technique, a manual evaluation will be conducted to identify undiscovered relationships from process-side effect pairs that are not mentioned in literature. in addition, we are interested in a research on personalized drug responsive expression data by applying multi-level networks for personalized medicine. by exploring the relationship between drugs and phenotypes on the multi-level network, we will be able to understand the mechanisms underlying drug involvement in the human body.
