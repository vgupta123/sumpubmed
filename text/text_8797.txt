BACKGROUND
interleukin- <dig>  is the prototype member of the il- <dig> cytokine family, also termed neuropoietic cytokines, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ciliary neurotrophic factor , leukemia inhibitory factor , oncostatin m, cardiotrophin- <dig> , cardiotrophin-like cytokine , neuropoietin and b cell stimulatory factor  <dig>   <cit> . a common feature of all family members is the signaling through a specific receptor that is associated to the intracellularly located transduction component gp <dig>  subsequently, the janus-activated kinase-signal transducer, activator of transcription  and mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathways are activated. neuropoietic cytokines display multiple functions in the peripheral  and central nervous systems , including the developing and adult brain, synaptic plasticity as well as the brain's response to injury and disease. in particular these molecules control cell fate and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells during development; due to their neurotrophic and regenerative actions they crucially affect injury-induced neurogenesis, neuronal survival and regeneration; moreover, these molecules can also influence neuronal activity and are implicated in long-term potentiation .

cellular functions of il- <dig> are mediated by two specific receptors, the membrane-bound  <dig> kda il- <dig> receptor  or the soluble form of il-6r  which can be generated either by shedding of il-6r or by alternative splicing of the il-6r mrna  <cit> . using s-il-6r, il- <dig> responsiveness may be conferred to cells expressing the transduction component gp <dig>  but are devoid of membrane-bound il-6r in the process of transsignaling  <cit> . the transsignaling mechanism led to the development of a fusion protein in which il- <dig> is covalently linked to s-il-6r thereby creating a unimolecular protein with enhanced biological activities. the fusion protein, termed hyper-il- <dig> , turned out to be fully active at 100–1000-fold lower concentrations as compared to the combination of the two separate molecules  <cit> .

the neurotrophin  family of growth factors including nerve growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , neurotrophin- <dig>  and nt-4/ <dig> is important for development, maintenance and survival of many different cell types in the pns and the cns  <cit> . nts are also involved in regulating adult neurogenesis  <cit> , learning and memory  <cit> . nts are synthesized as pront precursors that may be processed to mature nts intra- and extracellulary by specific proteases  <cit> . nts exert their effects via two different types of cellular receptors: pan-neurotrophin receptor p <dig>  which binds all nts with a similar affinity, and the family of high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors . the interactions of pronts and nts with the nt-receptors comprise a complex signaling system thus generating a broad variety of biological effects  <cit> .

in the first report of il- <dig> actions on neural cells rat pheochromocytoma cells , a well characterised cellular model for neuronal differentiation, were incubated for up to  <dig> days with b-cell stimulatory factor bsf-2/il- <dig> thereby inducing significant neurite outgrowth  <cit> . pc <dig> cells that were differentiated either using irradiation  <cit>  or the well-known hypoxia mimetic agent cocl <dig>  <cit>  require il- <dig> expression. we have demonstrated that primary sympathetic neurons  <cit>  and pc <dig> cells  <cit>  can strongly respond to il- <dig> by transsignaling, and that the potential of il- <dig> to induce neuronal differentiation in pc <dig> cells is in close correlation to the availability of s-il-6r  <cit> . pc <dig> cell differentiation is accompanied by enhanced expression of gap- <dig> mrna at  <dig> hours after stimulation with il-6/s-il-6r  <cit> . moreover, we found that the fusion protein h-il- <dig> is a highly active molecule in inducing survival of cultured sympathetic neurons, comparable to the effects of ngf  <cit> . recently, il6ril <dig>  a fusion protein in which il- <dig> is directly linked to the extracellular domain of the il- <dig> specific receptor, has been used for expression profiling studies in primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia. in these cells, il6ril <dig> strongly increases axonal network and expression of neural genes  <cit> .

a significant problem in the clinical treatment of peripheral nerve injury is that the currently used therapeutic approaches do not allow complete neuronal recovery  <cit> . mixtures comprising neuropoietic cytokines, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor ligands  and nts are being tested for the suitability to generate a microenvironment with a high reparative potential upon local administration at the site of the lesion  <cit> .

in the present study we monitored changes in neuronal gene expression induced by incubation of pc <dig> cells for  <dig> hours with h-il- <dig> as well as ngf, and compared the genetic programs utilized by these stimuli for neuronal differentiation.

RESULTS
overall changes in gene expression patterns in il-6- and ngf-stimulated pc <dig> cells
affymetrix gene chip u34a arrays were used to analyse global changes in gene transcripts using a cutoff in the change of gene expression of > 2-fold. in pc <dig> cells stimulated for  <dig> h with  <dig> ng/ml h-il- <dig>  we found  <dig> differently expressed genes as compared to unstimulated controls. of them,  <dig> genes were upregulated with gene expression values from 2-fold to 1085-fold, whereas  <dig> genes were found to be downregulated in the range from -2-fold to -61-fold. the genes are further classified into major functional categories including cytokines , enzymes , g-protein coupled receptors , growth factors , ion channels , kinases , nuclear receptors , peptidases , phosphatases , transcription regulators , transmembrane receptors , transporters  and molecules with other functions .

exemplary validation of microarray data using lightcycler quantitative rt-pcr analyses  on gap- <dig> and reg3b mrna expression
for an exemplary validation of the microarray data, qrt-pcr using lightcycler was performed on gap- <dig> and reg3b mrna expression. in the microarray analyses, gap- <dig> mrna was found to be upregulated 3-fold by il- <dig> , whereas qrt-pcr revealed an induction of about 20-fold . in ngf-treated pc <dig> cells, gap- <dig> mrna was found to be upregulated by < 2-fold and therefore did not meet the exclusion criteria applied in the current work. however, qrt-pcr analyses revealed a 10-fold induction of gap- <dig> mrna levels induced by ngf in pc <dig> cells . thus, pc <dig> cells treated with il- <dig> or ngf undergo substantial neuronal differentiation. reg3b mrna expression in the microarray analysis was found to be induced to 672-fold by il- <dig> , whereas qrt-pcr revealed an induction of reg3b mrna by about 955-fold . in ngf-treated pc <dig> cells, neither microarray nor qrt-pcr analyses revealed changes in rge3b expression.

ingenuity biological functional analyses of the gene sets regulated by il- <dig> and ngf in pc <dig> cells
the criteria applied for the search of major biological function categories were maximum number of genes and the p-value of significance. as shown in table  <dig>  top biological functions found to be regulated by il- <dig> include cancer , cellular growth and proliferation , cell death , cell-to-cell signalling and interaction , tissue development  and others. a further gene set is involved in nervous system development and function . the p-values in the range of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> indicate statistical significance.

discussion
in a previous study, we have used pc <dig> cells to examine the effects of il-6/s-il6r on neuronal differentiation in comparison to ngf  <cit> . already after  <dig> hours of exposure to il-6/s-il-6r or ngf pc <dig> cells are highly active in cellular growth and proliferation displaying pronounced formation of extending neurites. combined incubation with il-6/s-il- <dig> plus ngf drastically enhanced cell number and neurite outgrowth arguing for an additive effect of both stimuli on neuronal differentiation. in the current study we have chosen this time point to perform microarray analyses in order to monitor changes in gene expression and to compare the genetic programs utilized for neuronal differentiation by il- <dig> versus ngf.

an important aspect in gene expression profiling using microarrays is the accuracy of the measurements in the relative changes in mrna expression. thus, alternative technologies such as qrt-pcr are used for the validation of microarray data  <cit> . several systematic studies comparing the changes in gene expression obtained from oligonucleotide- or cdna arrays to data from qrt-pcr revealed that a good correlation exists for genes exhibiting fold-change differences in expression of > 2-fold  <cit> . therefore, in our datasets all genes displaying changes in expression levels of < 2-fold were excluded. moreover, our exemplary validation data on gap-43- and reg3b-expression are in line with other previous reports confirming that it is rather the magnitude of fold change varying between qrt-pcr and affymetrix-analysis, but not the direction.

detailed ingenuity biological function analyses reveal that il- <dig> and ngf activate gene sets that regulate the same process in neuronal differentiation and nervous system development, however, utilizing completely distinguished sets of individual molecules. this may explain our previous observation that combined application of il-6/s-il-6r plus ngf generates an additive effect on pc <dig> cell differentiation. important processes in neuronal differentiation and nervous tissue development include cellular growth and proliferation in order to enhance cell number. neurite outgrowth and network generation requires migration of neurons or nerve growth cones. neuronal navigation is guided by the interaction of the neuron with its local environment, in particular by chemotaxis as the key mechanism. this process involves three major steps including directional sensing along a gradient of chemotactic factors, cellular motility i.e. the cell's movement by changes in cytoskleletal organisation and cellular adhesion and cellular polarisation  <cit> . certainly, a key step in the regulation of these processes is the increased gene expression of growth factors and functionally related external molecules, indicating convergence of several different signaling pathways . in il- <dig> stimulated pc <dig> cells these tasks may be taken by growth differentiation factor  <dig> , platelet-derived growth factor alpha , hepatocyte growth factor , regenerating islet-derived  <dig> alpha , regenerating islet-derived  <dig> beta/pancreatitis-associated protein i , growth hormone releasing hormone  and adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide . ngf recruits gdf <dig> , transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  and brain-derived neurotrophic factor . tgfb <dig> is the prototype member of the tgfb-superfamily comprising multifunctional growth factors with numerous cell and tissue functions such as cell cycle control, regulation of early development, differentiation, extracellular matrix  formation and chemotaxis. in the nervous system, tgfb <dig> has been shown to regulate neuroprotection against glutamate cytotoxicity, ecm production, and cell migration in the cerebral cortex, control of neuronal death as well as survival of neurons . gdf <dig> is a member of the tgfb- superfamily and has been shown to be a potent trophic factor in the brain . hepatocyte growth factor  is a chemoattractant and a survival factor for embryonic motor neurons. in addition, sensory and sympathetic neurons and their precursors respond to hgf with increased differentiation, survival and axonal outgrowth  <cit> . moreover, hgf may synergize with other neurotrophic factors to potentiate the response of developing neurons to specific signals  <cit> . platelet derived growth factor  has been suggested to support neuronal differentiation  <cit> , and has previously been reported to act as a mitogen for immature neurons  <cit>  and neural progenitor cells  <cit> . reg3a and reg3b/papi are members of the regenerating protein /pancreatitis-associated protein  family representing a complex group of small secretory proteins which display many different functions, among them growth factor activity for neural cells  <cit> . so far, only limited knowledge is available about the role and function of pap/reg-proteins in the nervous system. reg3b/papi expression is induced in spinal motor neurons as well as subsets of the dorsal root ganglion neurons  <cit> . moreover, in vitro reg3b/papi has a mitogenic effect on schwann cells  <cit> . in a hypoglossal nerve injury model in rats, expression of reg3b/papi mrna was found to be enhanced in injured motor neurons after axotomy and a marked induction of reg3g/papiii mrna was observed in the distal part of the injured nerve  <cit> . more recently, reg3g/papiii has been identified as a macrophage chemoattractant that is induced in and released from injured nerves  <cit> . with reg1a/psp and reg3g/papiii, two further members of the reg/pap family are induced by il- <dig> in pc <dig> cells. it is noteworthy that these genes are up-regulated at the highest levels obtained in the entire dataset for il- <dig>  in ngf-treated pc <dig> cells, no up-regulation of the pap/reg protein genes was observed. the results in our study are in line with an earlier report demonstrating up-regulation of pap/reg gene family members in pc <dig> cells upon stimulation with il-6/s-il-6r  <cit> .

so far various studies have investigated gene expression profiles in ngf-treated pc <dig> cells applying different experimental protocols in respect to time points and periods of ngf administration  <cit> . from most studies, it is obvious that pc <dig> cells require at least  <dig> to  <dig> days of ngf-treatment to obtain the fully differentiated neuronal phenotype. the most significant morphological changes occur within the first  <dig> days, reaching a plateau phase at day  <dig>  <cit> . redundant data sets as well as unique genes have been identified and followed. our study provides novel candidate genes activated in the early phase of the differentiation process and thus may enlarge the repertoire of known ngf-regulated genes.

the current study reveals novel aspects of il- <dig> action, notably that it applies several major routes to direct pc <dig> cell differentiation. besides up-regulation of growth factors known to act in autocrine and paracrine fashion to take over further tasks in the differentiation process, these include induction of pacap, a pleiotropic molecule with a broad spectrum of biological functions. among them are actions as a neurotrophic factor similar to ngf as well as induction of transcription factors known to be of key importance in neuronal differentiation  <cit> .

upregulation of pacap could have an important impact on il-6-induced pc <dig> cell differentiation. a recent report provided data from microarray analyses of pacap-regulated gene transcripts in primary cultures of sympathetic neurons at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours of stimulation  <cit> . a comparison with our data reveals that many gene families that are activated by pacap in primary sympathetic neurons are also induced by il- <dig> in pc <dig> cells . thus, many of the effects of il- <dig> on pc <dig> cells are likely to be mediated by the intermediate autocrine and/or paracrine action of pacap. pacap is a member of a family of neuropetides known to activate class ii g-protein coupled receptors . other family members include growth hormone releasing hormone  and calcitonin-related peptide beta  which are activated by il- <dig> in pc <dig> cells by 31-and 195-fold, respectively. all members of the class ii gpcr superfamily regulate intracellular camp-levels by receptor coupling to the gs-adenylate cyclase-camp signaling pathway  <cit> . a further mechanism of pacap action in pc <dig> cells could be a transactivation of trka receptors  <cit> . however, in light that the overlap in the datasets of il- <dig> versus ngf is rather small, trka activation may not be a primary event at all or at the time point of our study.

+, upregulated -, downregulated; n.c., not changed from control cultures; gene symbols are from ipa tool

a further key step in il- <dig> actions on pc <dig> cell differentiation is the induction of rara and egr-1/zif <dig>  two transcription factors known to be of crucial importance in neuronal differentiation. among the genes regulated by retinoic acid is gap- <dig>  a neuron specific protein frequently used as a marker of neuronal differentiation as it is expressed in most neurons during neuronal development, nerve regeneration and ltp  <cit> . the data herein are confirmative to our previous study in which we have found induction of gap- <dig> mrna upon stimulation of pc <dig> cells with il-6/s-il-6r  <cit> . egr-1/zif <dig> is induced in nearly every model of long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the cns  <cit>  and suppression of zif <dig> prevents neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . recently candidate target genes of zif <dig> in pc <dig> cells were identified suggesting that a key component of the long-lasting effects of zif <dig> on cns plasticity is the regulation of proteasome activity  <cit> .

signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/ <dig> , two members of the stat family of transcriptions factors involved in signaling by interferons   <cit>  are activated by stimulation of the pc <dig> cells with il- <dig>  as we could not detect changes in ifn gene expression, an autocrine action of pdgf is the most likely candidate for upregulation of stat1/ <dig> as described for neural progenitor cells  <cit> . stat1/ <dig> may upregulate interferon regulatory factor 1-expression, a further transcription factor of ifn-signaling. breast cancer  <dig>  encodes a tumour suppressor gene whose germ line mutations in women are associated with a genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. stat <dig> transcriptional activity is decreased by a physical interaction with brca <dig> as a key step in the regulation of ifn-induced cellular growth arrest  <cit> . by the action of il- <dig>  brca <dig> gene expression is down-regulated thus supporting stat <dig> mediated pc <dig> cell growth. we failed to detect stat <dig> expression, the key transcription factor of il- <dig> signaling. this is most likely due to the fact that stat <dig> gene transcription occurs very early in il-6-stimulation and is already terminated at the time point of the analysis, or the expression levels are below 2-fold and thus did not meet the exclusion criteria.

the morphological changes during nervous system development are controlled by interactions of individual neurons with the ecm. signals from the ecm into a particular neuron are mediated by integrins via associated adapter molecules. in this way growth factor induced receptor tyrosine kinase - and integrin-mediated signalling determine the fate of a particular cell, notably differentiation, cell shape, adhesion, polarity, migration, as well as proliferation versus apoptotic cell death . lim and senescent cell antigen-like domains1/pinch  is an intracellular adaptor molecule providing the molecular link of an integrin-rtk network. lims <dig> physically connects integrin-linked kinase  to non-catalytic  tyrosine kinase adaptor protein  <dig> , an adapter molecule of the growth factor receptor   <cit> . lims <dig> is activated by il- <dig> as well as ngf and thus is one of few genes regulated in the common subset. in contrast to il- <dig>  ngf simultaneously up-regulates major components of the ecm including collagen, type xi, alpha <dig> , col12a <dig>  fibronectin <dig>  as well as fibrillin <dig>  .

in contrast to ngf, only one publication provided expression profiling data analysing gene sets regulated by il- <dig> upon neuronal differentiation. primary cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia  were treated with il6ril <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively. a detailed comparison reveals that only a small number of commonly regulated genes may be identified in the datasets that are regulated in parallel or opposite direction. these include egr- <dig> , tgfa , tgfb , pdgfa  and irf- <dig>   <cit> .

the results obtained from our study may also have impact into clinical treatments of injured peripheral nerves which, in contrast to central nerves, have the ability to recover from damage. currently the therapy of choice is the use of autologous grafts where the defect is bridged with a section of autologous nerve tissue, mostly a sensory nerve  <cit> . alternatively, nerve conduits or decellularized nerve grafts can be used; however, no therapy could yield a satisfactory functional recovery  <cit> . various combinations of nts, neuropoietic cytokines and gfls have been shown to generate a microenvironment suitable to improve nerve repair  <cit> . the results of our study may provide novel aspects for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury as the local application of a designer cytokine such as h-il- <dig> with a strongly enhanced bioactivity on neuronal development and neurite outgrowth in combination with nts and/or gfls may create a microenvironment with a strong reparative potency.

CONCLUSIONS
il- <dig> and ngf utilize different genetic programs to exert the same biological functions in neuronal differentiation. an important step is the recruitment of many growth factors that may act in autocrine and/or paracrine fashion and may control the long-term effects on growth, neuronal differentiation or survival.
