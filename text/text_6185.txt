BACKGROUND
pollen-pistil interaction is initiated when the male gametophyte is transferred from the anther to the stigma. the pollen grain then starts to hydrate and germinate, forming a pollen tube that grows through the carpel’s internal tissues to deliver its two sperm cells into the embryo sac. pollen tubes elongate through the extracellular matrix of the pistil tissues, extending by an actin-myosin-based tip-growth mechanism that transports vesicles loaded with new cell wall material to the extending apex and finally, when arriving at the embryo sac, enter into the synergid cell. fundamentally during this type of localised, tip-focused growth, the cytoplasm is polarized directing secretory events to the tip. internal gradients and transmembrane ion fluxes, notably of calcium ions, are another key feature of pollen tube growth  <cit> .

arabidopsis pollen transcriptome analysis showed the expression of a unique subset of genes relative to the sporophytic tissues  <cit> . furthermore, changes in gene expression patterns occur during the development of the male gametophyte from a microspore to a mature tricellular pollen grain  <cit> . more recently, genome-wide expression profiling of pollen tubes grown in vitro identified another set of genes that are expressed in the pollen tube but not in pollen, which suggests de novo mrna synthesis in the growing pollen tube  <cit> . the gene expression profiles of in vitro- and semi in vivo-grown arabidopsis pollen tubes have also been characterized and were found to differ; this lead to the discovery of a specific sub-set of genes that are activated by potentiation of the pollen tube by the pistil  <cit> .

among the genes, or gene families that may be involved in the transition from a sporophytic to a gametophytic-developmental program are those which code for arabinogalactan proteins . agps constitute a large family of cell wall proteoglycans that are found on the plasma membrane, in the cell wall, in the apoplastic space, and in secretions. they have also been found in detergent-resistant membranes isolated from arabidopsis suggesting their presence in lipid rafts  <cit> . key distinguishing features of agps are:  the carbohydrate, usually branched type ii arabino- <dig> -galactan, o-linked to hyp residues of the protein backbone, which constitutes 90–98%  of the molecular mass,  the protein backbone typically rich in the dipeptide motifs ala-hyp, ser-hyp, thr-hyp, val-pro, gly-pro and thr-pro,  a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  membrane anchor, predicted to be present on most, but not all, agps and  the ability to bind to a class of synthetic chemical dyes, known as yariv reagents  <cit> , which are not only useful for detection, quantification and isolation of agps, but also for functional studies  <cit> .

the identification of arabidopsis pollen-specific agp genes has been used to scrutinize phenotypic changes in the respective null mutants. we previously identified two male gametophyte agp genes  which showed functional redundancy  <cit> . an agp <dig> agp <dig> double null mutant was subsequently obtained. the double null mutant exhibited segregation distortion, as assessed by the number of aborted pollen grains, suggesting that the gametophyte generation was affected. the strong reduction in pollen germination and pollen tube growth rate, together with premature ectopic germination of pollen   <cit> , prompted us to further analyze this mutant, in order to gain insight into the mode of action of agps. we decided to examine the transcriptome of the agp <dig> agp <dig> double null mutant pollen tubes, using the affymetrix ath <dig> genome array.

here we report the identification of  <dig> genes whose expression in the double null mutant pollen tubes was shown to be either reduced or elevated, when compared to wild type pollen tubes. these genes can be used as starting points to dissect the gene regulatory networks in which agps are involved during pollen tube growth. in parallel, we performed yeast two-hybrid experiments to identify interactors of agp <dig> and agp <dig>  and to provide evidence for the biological functions of these agps.

RESULTS
an arabidopsis line simultaneously null for two pollen-specific agp genes, agp <dig> and agp <dig>  has been characterized in our laboratory and found to display notable phenotypic alterations, namely partially aborted pollen grains, reduced germination potential and precocious germination inside the anthers  <cit> . furthermore, under the conditions used in this study pollen tubes of the double mutant were statistically shorter  than those of the wild type .

to further characterize the agp <dig> agp <dig> mutant line a differential microarray screen was carried out to identify genes with modified expression in the  <dig> h-grown pollen tubes of agp <dig> agp <dig> compared to wild type pollen tubes.

general data analysis
the number of expressed genes in the wild type pollen tubes  was found to be  <dig>  which is approximately 28% of the total number of genes represented in the genechip arabidopsis ath <dig> genome array. this value is in close agreement with those published for microarray studies of arabidopsis pollen tubes using the same type of microarray chips and experimental set up, i.e., in vitro-grown pollen tubes harvested 4– <dig> h post-germination  <cit> . microarray data was published in geo  with the record number gse <dig> 

functional classification of wild type pollen tube transcriptomes
the transcriptome of wild type pollen tubes  was categorized into  <dig> functional groups according to the mapman visualization software . of the genes indicated as present,  <dig> % had unknown functions, whereas the rest were primarily involved in protein synthesis , rna transcription and processing , signaling , transport , and cell organization and cytoskeleton . this functional distribution is consistent with the recruitment of cell resources for pollen tube growth, and is in agreement with other pollen and pollen tube microarray studies  <cit> .


arabidopsis agp <dig> agp <dig> differentially expressed genes
the number of genes expressed in the agp <dig> agp <dig> mutant pollen tubes was roughly equal to that of the wild type control although only  <dig> % of expressed genes were common to both data sets . there are two gene populations of specific interest; 1) those present only in the double mutant and 2) those present only in the wild type pollen tubes. however, a statistical analysis of the significantly differentially expressed genes necessarily produced a rather different population of genes from that shown in figure  <dig>  genes were considered to be differentially expressed from those they were compared with if the 90% lower confidence bound of the fold change between experiment and baseline was above  <dig> , resulting in a median false discovery rate  of less than 5%. observing such criterion a population of  <dig> differentially expressed genes was obtained which accounts for  <dig> % of the pollen tube transcriptome . these  <dig> genes included  <dig> genes present only in agp <dig> agp <dig>   <dig> genes present only in wild type, and  <dig> genes expressed in both. about 60% of these  <dig> genes were up-regulated in agp <dig> agp <dig>  with the remaining 40% being down-regulated. overall the agp <dig> agp <dig> mutation caused an up-regulation of over  <dig> genes in arabidopsis pollen tubes.


validation of gene expression
rna levels were independently verified for a collection of genes, either by real-time pcr  or by conventional semi-quantitative rt-pcr. genes were selected on the basis of expression differences between the two microarray data sets and of absolute signal values . the relative expression levels for all genes tested were consistent with the results of the microarray experiments, thus confirming its reliability.

functional classification of differentially expressed genes
according to the mapman classification software, the functional classification of the entire double mutant transcriptome, does not substantially diverge from the functional classification of the wild type transcriptome . however, a significant number of genes are differentially expressed, i.e. they are either up- or down-regulated in response to the absence of two agp gene products. the mapman functional classification of these differentially expressed genes is shown in figure  <dig> 


the mapman functional bins “protein”, “rna”, “transport”, “signaling”, “cell”, “dna, and “stress” are the groups in which the greatest number of genes was altered, and together account for almost half of the differentially expressed genes .

a sub-cluster of the larger “protein” cluster that contains genes with f-box motifs was particularly striking for its differential signal intensities and number of genes affected, with a representation factor of  <dig> × relative to the arabidopsis genome. likewise, the sub-clusters “signaling.calcium”, and “stress.abiotic.heat” show enrichment factors of  <dig> × and  <dig> ×, respectively, in the differentially expressed gene set, as compared to the whole genome. the sub-clusters “signaling.receptor.kinases” and “stress.biotic” were not enriched in the differentially expressed group of genes but were selected because of the high lbfc value of some of its members .

to identify possible gene interactions and/or associations we used a web interface  which is designed to analyze gene lists and prioritize genes for functional assays  <cit> . extracting the differentially expressed genes from the list of  <dig> genes with the highest signal intensity, a gene network was produced that highlighted a “response to heat” gene cluster .


agp <dig> and agp <dig> interactors detected by yeast-two hybrid assays
to experimentally detect putative interactors for agp <dig> and agp <dig> we used the core domains of these two proteins as baits to screen a normalized arabidopsis expression library. a whole plant cdna library was used as it was thought to be the best choice for identifying agp interactors. the library was generated from pools of cdnas obtained by mrna extracted from several organs at different developmental stages including developing inflorescences, developing siliques, and mature flowers just before, and at, anthesis. the library was normalised in order to achieve a better representation of low abundant messengers.

for the agp <dig> library mating plates,  <dig> colonies grew on selective media. forty-eight among them were selected randomly for sequencing and they revealed  <dig> unique possible candidates. the ones that had an absent call in our array experiment as well as in other publicly available pollen and pollen tube arrays  <cit>  were excluded, resulting in a set of  <dig> likely candidates for interaction . for the agp <dig> library mating plates only  <dig> colonies grew on selective media and all were sequenced. those resulted in  <dig> likely candidates for interaction .

of the putative interactors uncovered, four were selected to confirm interaction with agp <dig> and one with agp11: calb domain family protein , mapk <dig> , ubq <dig>  and fbr <dig> , and ap2c <dig> , respectively. all co-transformed colonies with the agp and each candidate grew on all selective media, while each negative control did not, thus confirming the interaction .


discussion
sexual plant reproduction relies on the transfer of pollen to the stigma, where it hydrates and germinates into a pollen tube that extends through the pistil tissues to its target, the embryo sac. the agp <dig> agp <dig> double null mutant, besides showing a pollen tube growth defect also shows an early “inside the anther” germination phenotype. these deficiencies, provide further evidence for the role of agps in cell wall deposition and growth, and potentially represent a defect in receiving, or responding to, germination cues.

agps are a class of molecules whose study has been particularly challenging. more than 90% of the molecular mass is carbohydrate , and the role of the polypeptide chain, if any, is unknown. moreover, how the sugar content and quality varies between different gene products, and whether different gene products are identically glycosylated is equally poorly characterised. a direct consequence of this is that techniques and approaches used to study proteins often do not apply to agps. the massive sugar component which surrounds the protein core is likely to have a biological role but its biological interactions and mechanism of action have so far eluded characterisation. phenotypic differences between wild type and double mutant pollen tubes can only be attributed to the lack of both agp <dig> and agp <dig>  it is impossible to determine whether the differential gene expression is due to a direct effect of the lack of agps on the expression of these genes, or whether the altered expression profile is a secondary and unspecific consequence of the reduction in growth rate. however, an expression-based study should improve our understanding of agps and their functionality by identifying genes that are altered in response to the lack of specific agps. this type of investigation is likely to be particularly informative when applied to a process known to involve agps, in a plant structure, the pollen tube, whose transcriptome is less than a third of the genome.

this study yielded a number of candidate genes that may directly or indirectly interact with agps and have a role in pollen tube growth. however, a comparative analysis of the present data with the expression profile of arabidopsis culture cells subjected to yariv phenylglycoside reagent, which specifically binds to and precipitates agps  <cit> , was considered to be a valuable aid to the identification of genes which may be directly affected by the lack of agp <dig> and agp <dig> 

microarray screen
the overall difference obtained for expressed genes was substantial, with  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the double null mutant, compared with the wild type control. these  <dig> differentially expressed genes could be further classified into three subgroups:  <dig> genes that were expressed “de novo” in the double mutant,  <dig> genes that were absent in the mutant but present in the control, and a group of  <dig> genes whose expression levels were found to be altered but that did not affect the present/absent status.

the gene clustering using mapman software shows that the cluster “protein” contains the largest fraction of differentially expressed genes. “protein degradation” is undoubtedly the most represented group, in which the category of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is evident, with several of those genes belonging to the f-box protein family. the f-box is a protein motif of approximately  <dig> amino acids that function as a site for protein-protein interaction  <cit> . arabidopsis alone was reported to contain approximately  <dig> f-box genes  <cit> . by comparison, only  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> f-box proteins are encoded by saccharomyces cerevisiae, drosophila melanogaster, and human genomes, respectively  <cit> . such an apparent massive investment has also been found to be consistent with genetic studies linking specific plant f-box proteins to numerous processes, including hormone perception and signaling, stress protection, chromatin remodeling, homeostasis, circadian rhythms, self-incompatibility, and defense against pathogens  <cit> . in arabidopsis, recent genetic studies provided unequivocal evidence for the role of this protein degradation system during gametogenesis, which involved f-box  <dig>  <cit>  and a pair of ubiquitin-specific proteases   <cit> .

the analysis of the data obtained in the present work also shows calmodulins , in the cluster of signaling by calcium, among the differentially expressed genes with highest lbfc score, namely at5g <dig> and at4g <dig> , the latter functioning in trichome branching and being strongly expressed in pollen as shown by cml42::gus transgenic plants  <cit> . calcium signals are known to play important roles in plant growth and development, including pollen tube growth, and cams are the most ubiquitous calcium sensors in eukaryotes. popescu et al.  <cit>  developed a protein microarray to comprehensively investigate arabidopsis cam/cam-like interactions and identified new targets for these calcium sensors, one of which was an f-box protein. the relationship between agps and calcium is unsurprising, as these proteins are involved in pollen tube cell wall growth, and calcium is known to regulate pollen tube growth and fertilization  <cit> . the data obtained may suggest an interaction of agps with calcium through calmodulin. this was also implied using an alternative approach to study agp function which involved the use of - <dig> yariv reagent that specifically binds to, and presumably inactivates, a wide range of agps. guan and nothnagel  <cit>  analyzed the gene expression profile of arabidopsis culture cells subjected to yariv phenylglycoside reagent for  <dig> and  <dig> h in a microarray study. despite the specificities of the biological materials, several differentially expressed genes were found to be common between both experiments . the values of lbfc used in the present work could not be used for direct comparison with the data of guan and nothnagel  <cit> . however, all values of fold change of agp <dig> agp <dig> genes shown in additional file  <dig>  have values of lbfc above the threshold of  <dig> , which was the criterion used in our analysis. genes altered in yariv-treated cells also include several heat-shock protein genes, which is a functional group also found to be affected in agp <dig> agp <dig> 

comparative pistil transcriptome analyses  <cit>  identified a number of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in stress and defense responses. this is particularly interesting as there is evidence that the molecules involved in pollination and stress/defense responses may be evolutionary and functionally related. many authors have proposed that certain self-incompatibility mechanisms may have arisen through the modification of pre-existing pathogen defense mechanisms  <cit> .

the analysis of the stress cluster of the present data shows that the genes associated with biotic and abiotic types of stress, namely pr and heat shock protein genes, had their expression levels significantly shifted. in this cluster, genes such as at2g <dig> and at2g <dig> code for proteins of the cap  superfamily. members of the cap superfamily are widespread in living organisms,  <cit> , and have been intensely studied in mammalian fertilization mechanisms. they are most often secreted proteins and are involved in several processes including cell adhesion during fertilization. the plant pathogenesis proteins of the pr- <dig> family, which are synthesized during pathogen infection or other stress-related responses, belong to the cap superfamily but the precise functions of these proteins are still unresolved. in a recent study  <cit>  it was suggested that the glioma pathogenesis-related  <dig> , along with other members of the cap superfamily and several other proteins, are involved in the binding of sperm to the oocyte complex. also, in a work of microarrays of rice embryo sac cells  <cit> , it was revealed that allergen v5/tpx-1-related proteins, which are members of the cap superfamily, are abundant in the rice synergid cell. collectively these findings strengthen the possible role of cap domain-containing proteins in cellular adhesion and fertilization.

the high level of expression of  <dig> members of the cap superfamily in arabidopsis pollen tube is relevant given their predicted signaling function. moreover, knowing that these proteins are most likely secreted and the fact that one of its members  is only present in the agp <dig> agp <dig> double mutant, may indicate some type of relationship between agps and cap processing.

application of a different bioinformatic tool, genemania, a co-expression network was obtained which highlighted a stress functional gene cluster. surprisingly, some of the genes correlated with those whose expression was found to be altered by treatment with yariv reagent for  <dig> h   <cit> . guan and nothnagel  <cit>  compared the genes that were induced by yariv treatments with genes whose expression had been previously been shown to be induced by other conditions and concluded that the gene expression profile induced by yariv treatment was similar to that of wound response. knowing that pollen tube growth and discharge and the defense against fungal attack are alike in many respects, and that both pollen tubes and fungi exploit similar receptor proteins  <cit>  we propose a role for agps in this process where, apparently, pollen tube and fungal hyphae activate plant cell responses.

yeast two-hybrid experiments
to identify possible agp <dig> and/or agp <dig> interactors, yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed. these experiments revealed some interesting partners involved in the proteosome-independent roles of ubiquitination in signaling and endocytosis.

besides the well-known role in proteosome degradation, ubiquitin conjugation is also involved in down-regulation of membrane receptors, transporters and channels. ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins leads to their endocytosis into the multivesicular endosome and most members of the ubiquitin ligase family responsible for trafficking of diverse proteins carry an n-terminal calcium-dependent lipid/protein c <dig> domain that specifically binds phosphoinositides in yeast  <cit> .

endosomes are primarily intracellular sorting organelles, and receive proteins and lipids from both the biosynthetic and the endocytic pathways. plasma membrane proteins that are internalized by endocytosis are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or sorted for degradation, which is achieved by intermediate/late endosomes, also called multivesicular bodies   <cit> .

it is known that pollen tubes grow by rapid tip localized exocytosis, most probably coordinated with an also tip localized endocytosis. using arabidopsis and nicotiana pollen tubes as models, zhao et al.  <cit>  showed that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase  <dig>  regulates clathrin-dependent endocytosis in pollen tubes.

the internalization and secretion of arabinogalactan-rich glycoproteins through mvbs has been described but only microscopically  <cit> . the data obtained in the present study suggests a physiological interaction of agps with members of the endosomal system, and that agp <dig> and agp <dig>  two specific and highly expressed proteins in arabidopsis pollen and pollen tubes may be involved in this signaling pathway that sends and recycles proteins to the extracellular matrix. in the yeast two-hybrid screening assays, clathrin adaptor complexes were present such as mug <dig>  and mapk <dig>  syta , raba1b  and mag <dig> . these results give further support for the clathrin machinery of receptor internalization in pollen tubes.

although agps are presumably acting extracellularly, they are targeted to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane through vesicles, which originate in the er and golgi network. during the trafficking into the extracellular matrix it is probable that agps interact with cytosolic proteins such as bzip <dig> or fbr/eif5a, two regulatory proteins that were identified in the yeast two-hybrid experiments.

with endocytosis established as an essential plant cell function  <cit>  and agp <dig> and agp <dig> supposedly involved in this process, we looked further into the microarray data. three rab gtpases known as specific molecular markers of plant endosomes, ara <dig> , ara <dig>  and rha <dig>  are all down-regulated in agp <dig> agp <dig>  raba <dig>  and raba <dig> gtpases define a trans-golgi endosomal membrane that overlays with vha-a <dig>  one of the isoforms of a membrane integral v-atpase specifically localized to the tgn  <cit> . another subunit of v-atpases, det <dig>  is one of the most down-regulated genes in the present study and known to be involved in plant growth and development  <cit> .

a c <dig> domain is a protein structural domain involved in targeting proteins to cell membranes. c <dig> domains are modular lipid-binding domains found in a variety of proteins with functions that include vesicular transport, gtpase regulation, lipid modification, protein phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation  <cit> . the most extensively studied proteins included in the last group are the synaptotagmins . there are reports describing the involvement of c2-domain proteins in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. yang et al.  <cit>  showed that the arabidopsis c2-domain protein, bap <dig>  acts as a negative regulator of programmed cell death induced by biotic stimuli. this gene is differentially expressed in the present microarray experiment and in the yariv microarray experiment described by guan and nothnagel  <cit> . the third most up-regulated gene in the present data set is a calcium-dependent lipid binding protein, calb , a c <dig> protein which is also up-regulated in the yariv array. it seems relevant to highlight that the c <dig> calcium-dependent membrane targeting protein at1g <dig> was identified as an agp <dig> interactor in the yeast-two hybrid assay. furthermore, in a yeast two-hybrid assay performed on nicotiana alata  <cit>  to identify pollen proteins potentially involved in deciphering chemical signals provided by the pistil, two pistil-specific agps from the transmitting tract were used to hybridize against a pollen cdna library. the authors found three pollen proteins that interacted with those pistil agps, one of which was a c <dig> domain-containing protein .

analysis of the present results further identified a possible involvement of agp <dig> and agp <dig> in membrane trafficking, and that a plant retromer may be present in pollen tubes where the movement of vesicles is very important. a retromer is a multiprotein complex that is strongly conserved in eukaryotes. it is involved in the recycling of transmembrane receptors, which mediate the transport of vacuolar/lysosomal hydrolases  <cit> . in yeast, retromers consist of a large subunit with three vacuolar protein sorting  proteins, vps35p, vps29p and vps26p. homologs of these proteins are present in mammals and in plants. recently, oliviusson et al.  <cit>  showed that the three vps proteins, namely vps <dig> , vps <dig> , and vps <dig>  of the plant retromer complex are localized to multivesicular bodies  in tobacco by <dig> cells. mag <dig>  a homolog of vps <dig>  is differentially expressed in the present array, as is vps <dig>  besides, vps <dig> is also differentially expressed in the yariv microarray data and mag <dig> is one of the agp <dig> interactors in the yeast-two hybrid experiment. recent data strongly suggest that the retromer complex has conserved a function in mediating retrograde trafficking  <cit>  and that vps <dig> is involved in the cycling of certain pm proteins and required for the establishment of cell polarity during organ initiation in plants  <cit> .

a working model for the role of agps in pollen tube development which integrates the data obtained in this work is proposed .


CONCLUSIONS
it is known that plant cells recycle pectins and agps  <cit> . pectin cross-linking calcium may be removed and pectins recycled, maintaining the loosened walls essential for growth. agps can also be recycled, to maintain their concentration level at the pollen tube apex necessary for them to perform a signaling role.

all the data obtained in the present work emphasizes the remodeling of the plasma membrane via endocytosis. endosomal trafficking pathways are emerging as fundamental regulators of the wall physiology, involved in multiple signaling pathways and developmental processes. the interaction of agp <dig> and agp <dig> with members of the pollen tube endosome machinery provides strong evidence for the recycling of these cell wall proteins .

it is our understanding that as we continue to unravel the signal transduction processes involved in intercellular communication during pollen/pistil interaction, we will discover more about the function of agps.
