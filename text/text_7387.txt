BACKGROUND
in bacteria, non-coding rnas  are a heterogeneous group of sequence-specific regulators of gene expression, normally lacking a protein-coding function. they are typically 50â€“ <dig> nucleotides in length  <cit> , and regulate mrna translation or decay but sometimes also directly modulate certain protein functions. most stress responses in the organism best-studied in this respect, e. coli, include at least one small regulatory rna as part of the regulon  <cit> . however, their functions also include the control of plasmid and viral replication  <cit> , bacterial virulence  <cit> , quorum sensing  <cit> , or the acquired resistance against bacteriophages  <cit> .

in many cases, these ncrnas function through sequence-specific base pairing; hence they frequently have a  base complementarity to their target rna molecules. the vast majority of known ncrnas is encoded at genomic locations far away from their target genes. however, some ncrnas are transcribed from the reverse complementary strand of the respective target and hence these are fully or partially overlapping with their target rnas, constituting the class of antisense rnas. except for the more common types of ncrna , genes encoding ncrnas are not annotated during standard genome analysis. the efforts to accomplish their identification in bacteria can broadly be divided into  sequencing the population of small rnas or  prediction by bioinformatics tools  followed by experimental verification . as a result of such systematic searches, more than  <dig> ncrnas are now known in e. coli, most of which had been overlooked by traditional genome analysis.

cyanobacteria currently raise considerable interest as they perform oxygenic photosynthesis, fix atmospheric co <dig> and nitrogen, frequently produce large quantities of bioactive secondary metabolites and due to their potential for the production of biofuels. as long as there is sufficient light available for photosynthesis, cyanobacteria populate widely diverse environments such as freshwater, the oceans, rock surfaces, desert soil or the polar regions. their adaptation to vastly different environmental conditions suggests the existence of sophisticated regulatory mechanisms. therefore, various types of regulatory rna can be expected that interplay with the different signal transduction pathways and stress responses. indeed, computational-experimental screens based on comparative genome analysis identified seven different ncrnas in the marine cyanobacteria prochlorococcus and synechococcus  <cit>  which were called yfr1- <dig> for cyanobacterial functional rna. in a follow-up study making use of high density microarrays and exploiting the genome information from meanwhile  <dig> different prochlorococcus genome sequences, additional  <dig> ncrnas and  <dig> antisense rnas were found  <cit> . unicellular marine cyanobacteria of these genera provide an excellent dataset for computational predictions that require comparative genome information since currently  <dig> different genome sequences from very closely related isolates are available  <cit> . however, a major bottleneck in the work with these marine cyanobacteria is that despite some recent progress  <cit> , protocols for genetic manipulation are very slow or not available at all. therefore, the finding that two of these ncrnas are phylogenetically widely distributed enabled direct genetic work on their functional relevance: yfr <dig> is distributed throughout the cyanobacterial radiation  <cit>  and might play a role in the adaptation to redox stress or the regulation of carbon uptake  <cit> , whereas yfr <dig> was identified as the homolog of the 6s rna  <cit>  which is found in all eubacteria  <cit> . however, for efficient genetic and biochemical analysis of cyanobacterial ncrnas it would be very desirable to identify a set of ncrna candidate genes in model cyanobacteria that are easy to manipulate and for which extended mutant, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets are available. in addition to yfr <dig> which exists in all four unicellular cyanobacteria targeted here  <cit> , the only currently known ncrnas in model cyanobacteria are an antisense rna covering the ferric uptake regulator gene fura in anabaena pcc  <dig> over its full length  <cit> , and the antisense rna isrr, regulating the gene for the light-absorbing protein isia under conditions of iron limitation and redox stress in the unicellular synechocystis pcc  <dig>  <cit> .

in recent years, comparative genomics-based prediction of ncrna genes has become a standard method to search for such genes within bacterial genomes  <cit> . thus, the availability of genome sequences from closely enough related species is a critical factor as is the conservation of ncrnas. in case of unicellular cyanobacterial model organisms, the lack of genome sequences from close relatives has been hampering such studies. with the recent release of the microcystis aeruginosa nies- <dig> genome  <cit> , however, a cyanobacterium relatively close to synechocystis has been sequenced.

here we set out to identify possible ncrna genes and other rna elements  in the three unicellular model cyanobacteria synechocystis pcc <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig> and thermosynechococcus elongatus bp <dig> plus the toxic microcystis aeruginosa nies- <dig>  by biocomputational comparative genome analysis with a focus on synechocystis.

RESULTS
computational screening for novel ncrnas
to screen for novel rna elements, all intergenic regions > <dig> nt were extracted from the four genomes and analyzed as outlined in fig.  <dig>  leaving out all annotated genes, including trna and four structural rna genes. although single sequence elements and families of sequence elements that are specific to a single genome cannot be found by our approach, this procedure initially returned  <dig> predicted clusters holding  <dig> individual sequences, from which  <dig> belonged to synechocystis,  <dig> to synechococcus,  <dig> to thermosynechococcus and  <dig> to microcystis. however, these numbers were diminished in further filtering steps .

the analysis was basically focused on sequence and structure similarities. detailed information on all clusters predicted by our method including the positions of all sequences is available online  <cit> . this information, which we show exemplarily in the inset in fig.  <dig>  includes the location within the compared genomes, flanking genes, a secondary structure prediction as well as z-scores and probabilities in either forward  or reverse  orientation as computed by rnaz  <cit> . furthermore we conducted searches against rfam  <cit> , the database collecting ncrnas, and transtermhp  <cit> , of which the results are also given in the online material.

high-scoring putative rna elements
filtering with p > =  <dig>  or z < = - <dig>  reduced the initial number of  <dig> individual sequences in the  <dig> predicted clusters to  <dig> sequence clusters with  <dig> individual elements,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in synechocystis, synechococcus, thermosynechococcus and microcystis, respectively. a summary of the highest scoring clusters is given in table  <dig> <cit> . the venn diagram in fig.  <dig> <cit>  shows that more homologs were detected in the synechocystis/microcystis comparison than in any other pairwise combination, reflecting the phylogenetic relationships between these species pairs.

the total number of sequences in each cluster and the distribution within the four compared genomes plus the total alignment length  is given. the elements are ordered according to the highest rnaz  <cit>  probability in either forward  or reverse  orientation. the closer the probability to  <dig> , the more support for structural conservation as an rna element. note: hits restricted to microcystis or repeat elements bordering transposable elements have not been included. location is given for synechocystis pcc  <dig> if not indicated otherwise.

we previously showed the existence of yfr <dig> in three out of four tested marine cyanobacteria belonging to the genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus  <cit>  and later demonstrated its existence throughout the cyanobacterial radiation, including the four unicellular cyanobacteria targeted here  <cit> . it was, therefore, no surprise to find yfr <dig> among the top-scoring elements  in cluster  <dig> . although rna elements in cyanobacteria are only scarcely covered by rfam, the existing entries provided another positive control set: the thiamine riboswitch was correctly identified in three strains  and also two rna elements of unknown function were correctly found for synechocystis and microcystis but not for the other two cyanobacteria . however, we noted the functional role assumed for one of these conserved rna structures, the ykkc/yxkd element , to switch efflux pumps and detoxification systems in response to harmful environmental molecules, may not apply to the cyanobacterial homologs since they are neither in synechocystis nor in microcystis located upstream of a putative transporter gene.

synteny among high-scoring rna elements
the genomic location of a predicted ncrna gene or rna element in the same sequence neighbourhood in some or all of the studied cyanobacteria can also be a powerful tool for finding related ncrnas. among the  <dig> high-scoring sequence clusters in table  <dig>   <dig>  showed at least partial synteny. the high scoring element in cluster  <dig> illustrates this fact. the primary annotation gives no hint about the possible relatedness of the flanking genes. the flanking gene sufr annotated in microcystis encodes an iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis transcriptional regulator and similarity searches revealed that sll <dig>  syc2358d and sufr actually are orthologs of each other . flanking the intergenic region with the predicted rna element on the other side, genes ycf <dig> and sufb are clearly homologs of each other, whereas ftrc in synechococcus is not. yet, ftrc has been inserted in this genomic region as the proximate gene, syc2356_c, codes for the homolog of sufb and ycf <dig>  thus, the synteny among neighbouring genes clearly support the element predicted in cluster  <dig> as an orthologous rna element between the three species. other cases of partial synteny in flanking genes are observed in cluster  <dig> since trxa is present in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases and in cluster  <dig> with the orthologs speb  and agmatinase , whereas all other genes are different. special cases of synteny are exposed in cluster  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these four examples represent structurally conserved sequence elements upstream of a protein-coding gene to whom they are functionally connected; among them one riboswitch and two ribosomal leaders, thus this position must be conserved. the fourth example, the element upstream of groes contains the palindromic circe element  thought to bind the heat-shock repressor protein hrca  <cit> . here, we mapped the groes transcriptional start site to the first nt of the nine nt loop predicted by secondary structure analysis , confirming the previously determined start site  <cit> . these examples illustrate the variety of elements that become identified by our approach.

experimental verification
for exemplary experimental verification of predicted ncrna genes we chose two very different examples, one well-supported candidate with three members from cluster  <dig>  and one from cluster  <dig> . northern hybridization of total rna from synechocystis using strand-specific rna probes confirmed the existence of both ncrnas . since we verified the existence of both ncrnas experimentally, we decided to name these two ncrnas syr <dig> and syr <dig>  for synechocystis ncrna  <dig> and  <dig>  syr <dig> is a strongly accumulating ncrna transcribed from a gene in the fabf â€“ hoxh igr in the forward direction as the preceding gene fabf . the syr <dig> gene corresponds with a length of ~ <dig> nt to about two thirds of the fabf-hoxh intergenic spacer . judged by northern hybridization, there was no evidence for a possible cotranscription with fabf. the element predicted with the clid  <dig> is located 3' to a protein-coding gene, too, and is transcribed from the forward strand in synechocystis  <dig>  syr <dig> is an ~ <dig> nt ncrna transcribed from a gene in the apcc  â€“ prma  igr in the same forward direction as the preceding gene apcc. syr <dig> is accumulated to rather high amounts, too, but these appeared lower than in case of syr <dig> . the preceding apcc gene  encodes a short phycobilisome lc linker polypeptide and is the ultimate gene of a three-gene operon for phycobiliproteins. cotranscription between this operon and syr <dig> cannot be excluded unambiguously. however, a syr <dig> transcript start was mapped within apcc,  <dig> nt before the end of the reading frame. this fact is less exotic than it seems. at the expected spacing six nt upstream, the transcript start is preceded by a regular tata element . moreover, several examples indicate the location of ncrna promoters within the protein-coding part of a gene: transcription of the ssrs gene for 6s rna in e. coli is initiated at two promoters, from these the distally located promoter p <dig> responds to Ïƒ <dig> and Ïƒs rna polymerase holoenzymes and is located within the ygfe reading frame  <cit> . an example from synechocystis is provided with isrr, the antisense rna that is initiated from within the gene isia, although from the reverse complementary strand  <cit> .

in a more general sense these results demonstrate that, just judging from the prediction, both candidate ncrna genes might have been expected to be 3'utrs due to their close location to an mrna 3'end. we did not investigate their origin from a specific promoter further as we did for the yfr2a ncrna , but the results shown in fig.  <dig>  in particular the lack of a longer transcript signal in the respective agarose gel blots, plus specific race signals confirm unambiguously that they do accumulate as individual small transcripts and therefore constitute bona fide ncrnas.

a family of ncrnas that is widely conserved among cyanobacteria
the vast majority of the ~ <dig> bacterial ncrnas experimentally verified thus far have been identified in escherichia coli  <cit>  and a few other model proteobacteria and pseudomonas species. therefore it is not surprising that, with the exception of the four highly conserved ncrnas 6s rna, tmrna, ffs and rnpb, ortholog genes for ncrnas are known only among very closely related species such as between salmonella sp. and yersinia sp.  <cit> . here, with cluster  <dig> eight sequences were identified with high sequence and predicted secondary structure similarity to a family of ncrnas initially found in marine prochlorococcus  <cit> . there are four such ncrnas in prochlorococcus med <dig> which in the original publication had been named yfr <dig>  yfr <dig>  yfr <dig> and yfr <dig>  <cit> . from the eight new members to this family in cluster  <dig> three belong to synechocystis, one to thermosynechococcus and two each are predicted in synechococcus and in microcystis. since none of them has a more pronounced similarity to any of the original yfr2-yfr <dig> ncrnas from prochlorococcus med <dig>  we decided to call them all "yfr2" according to the first member in this group and then just to add a suffix. therefore, the three predicted candidates belonging to this ncrna family in synechocystis are yfr2a, yfr2b and yfr2c. all three are expressed in synechocystis . the yfr2a gene is located downstream of thioredoxin a  gene sll <dig>  both genes are in the same orientation but yfr2a originates from a specific initiation site of transcription, mapped by tap-race to position  <dig> in the genome ,  <dig> nt 3' of the sll <dig> stop codon . the other two ncrnas belonging to this family in synechocystis, yfr2b and yfr2c, originate from genes directly upstream of two protein-coding genes, slr <dig> and sll <dig>  in these two cases we mapped identical initiation sites of transcription for the ncrnas and their respective downstream located protein-coding gene, to genomic positions  <dig>  and  <dig> . therefore, transcription of these two mrnas occurs possibly by a read-through mechanism from yfr2b or yfr2c. whether this type of transcriptional fusion has functional relevance is currently unknown as are the functions of slr <dig> and sll <dig>  these genomic arrangements are not conserved as the genes adjacent to the other five candidate ncrna genes belonging to this family differ in the other three cyanobacteria. this lack of synteny supports a function of yfr2b and yfr2c independent from serving merely as 5' untranslated leaders of slr <dig> and sll <dig> 

sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions of the  <dig> yfr2-5-type ncrnas suggest a centrally located single-stranded loop element together with a short unpaired region at the 5' end that are highly conserved . the long helical stem bearing the  <dig> nt loop is very characteristically predicted in all sequences to be interrupted by at least one bulge at position - <dig> with regard to this loop . interestingly, this feature is shared with the yfr2-yfr <dig> ncrnas from marine cyanobacteria  <cit> . bulge motifs have been recognized in a wide range of rnas as key structural elements determining molecular recognition by other molecules  <cit> . therefore, the conserved bulges in yfr2-type ncrnas may indicate their interaction with proteins. indeed, another hint comes from the unpaired regions of these ncrnas which resemble the extended "gga" and "angga" rsma-binding motifs. the ncrnas rsmx, rsmy and rsmz found in pseudomonas species contain several gga and extended angga motifs  <cit> . for rsmy, these motifs have been shown to be essential for sequestration of rsma and its homolog rsme in pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit> . non-coding rnas containing this motif frequently have a titrating role on their target protein, regulating gene expression at the translational level. it was not possible, however, to identify rsma and rsme homologs in cyanobacteria.

expression analysis of yfr2a
starting with the mapped initiation site of yfr2a we chose the region located immediately upstream of it in a promoter fusion experiment with luxab genes to prove that it actually does contain a functional promoter. moreover, if the expression of an ncrna is regulated under certain environmental conditions this sometimes gives a hint into which processes this ncrna might be involved in. as controls, we chose the same dna fragment in reverse orientation and amplified and cloned the psba <dig>  promoter, again in both orientations.

the  <dig> nt upstream of yfr2a provided indeed very strong expression to the reporter genes â€“ under all tested conditions the measured fluorescence values were comparable to those obtained from the psba <dig> promoter-driven luciferase gene expression, whereas the reverse orientation of the same fragments provided very low activity only . under cold temperature  and heat  stress the activity of both promoters drops , a possible pleiotropic effect. under light stress, however, the activity of both promoters is stimulated. whereas the activity of the psba <dig> promoter is increased up to 250%, the yfr2a promoter becomes activated up to 300% . this is all the more striking since psba <dig> frequently serves as an example for a typical light-inducible promoter.

six clusters containing repetitive sequences
one problem when dealing with genome sequences of some cyanobacteria is the high number of repetitive sequences, mobile genetic elements and transposon-related sequences.

indeed, the output from our prediction pipeline was contaminated by imperfect inverted repeat sequences flanking different families of is elements, mainly in microcystis, and to a lesser extent in synechocystis. if subtracted from the data set, the total number of predicted rna elements  in synechocystis, synechococcus, thermosynechococcus and microcystis drops to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . such repetitive sequences were collected in six sequence clusters, namely # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> individual sequences, respectively. all  <dig> sequences from these clusters have been collected in a separate file and are accessible from our website  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics-based prediction of ncrna genes and candidate ncrna genes is more and more becoming a standard tool to search for such genes within bacterial genomes  <cit> .

here we provide the first list of ncrna and other rna element candidates for model unicellular cyanobacteria. surprisingly, we identified with yfr2a-yfr2c a family of ncrnas which is widely conserved among cyanobacteria and which become accumulated to high concentrations.

our experimental verification together with existing positive controls suggests a high number of positives in this candidate set. however, there are also putative 5' operon leaders, rho-independent 3' transcriptional terminators and possibly yet unidentified riboswitches in this data set. moreover, the output is contaminated to some extent by transposase-related sequences.

nevertheless, by analogy to other bacteria, including the most streamlined marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus med <dig>  <cit> , this number of ncrnas and other rna elements is probably a grave underestimation. therefore this analysis should be considered as a first step to become complemented by more exhaustive experimental screens, for instance by using tiling arrays or deep sequencing in the near future.
