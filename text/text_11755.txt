BACKGROUND
within recent years an overwhelming number of specific methods and protocols emerged for next-generation sequencing  <cit> . amongst them, transcriptome as well as whole-genome sequencing were of prime interest. both sequencing methods have tremendously accelerated our understanding of both the more dynamic function of rnas and the more static composition of the genome within a functional cell. transcriptome sequencing focuses on deciphering the complex expression pattern of rnas  <cit> , therefore identifying novel expressed rnas and transcript variants as well as isoforms which in turn lead to a better understanding of cell regulation, function and networks. whole-genome sequencing has for example highlighted insights into the subtle differences amongst the human population  <cit>  or major genomic re-arrangements found in cancer cells  <cit>  with both having a significant impact on cell fate and the living organism.

major improvements for the preparation of sequencing libraries for rna-seq as well as dna-seq have emerged  <cit> ; continually reducing the input amount needed which is generally in the microgram range. within recent years the field of single-cell sequencing for transcriptome and genome sequencing has advanced significantly  <cit> . there are already many examples available were either rna , or dna  <cit>  have been analyzed down to the single-cell resolution. recently, studies with the combined analysis of the genome and transcriptome of the same cell have also been published  <cit> . this is especially advantageous for applications where only a small fraction of the sample should be analyzed, or more importantly, where the sample is composed of a few cells only. such scenarios include for example early embryonic development which starts from a single cell expanding to a few dozen cells within the first developmental stages  <cit> . the elucidation of intra-tumor heterogeneity in biopsies  <cit>  as well as in in-vitro grown primary tumor spheres  <cit> , or the characterization of circulating tumor cells  <cit>  rely on the analyses of limited cell material. in addition, in-vitro cultured stem cells from both mouse and human are limited in the number of cells if sub-population and sub-colony differences in terms of gene expression are under investigation. for all settings, already subtle changes in genome integrity can have a major impact on the expression and regulation of rnas, and proteins within cells.

despite the advancements for both areas of sequencing minute amounts of either rna or dna, an assay enabling the combined sequencing of rna and dna from the very same sample still in the ultra-low input range would add to our understanding of the regulation and developmental processes affected by both, the function of genome integrity as well as rna expression and gene function.

here we describe a method which enables the preparation of whole transcriptome amplified cdna as well as the generation of whole-genome amplified dna from the same ultra-low input material derived from a sub-colony of in-vitro cultivated human embryonic stem cells. firstly, whole transcriptome amplified cdna was prepared from mrna only by using oligo-dt coupled magnetic beads, following cdna synthesis, 3'-tailing and pcr amplification. secondly, after magnetic coupling of the mrna/oligo-dt beads, whole-genome amplified dna was prepared from the retained dna by phi <dig> mediated amplification. both, the amplified cdna as well as dna were subjected to standard procedures for multiplex short fragment library preparation enabling illumina sequencing. using this approach, both the transcriptome as well as the genome of the same sample could be analyzed on both levels of nucleic acids present in cells, the rna and dna.

RESULTS
ultra-low input rna sequencing
in brief, cells for rna-seq were collected from human embryonic stem cells  serving as biological samples. colonies of hescs were mechanically dissociated into 200 μm × 200 μm square fragments consisting of 150– <dig> cells . the undifferentiated and pluripotent state of the cells was verified by microscopic assessment of morphology  and positive immunocytochemical co-staining for the well-established transcription factors and hesc-markers oct3/ <dig> and nanog  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> method overview for combined sequencing of mrna and whole genome dna. a schematics for sequencing of ultra-low input dna and mrna from a single cell-colony sample. b oct3/ <dig>  nanog and dapi staining of cultured human embryonic stem cells. rectangular cuts indicating size of sample applied . scale bar =200 μm



the picked sub-colony fragment was directly transferred into lysis buffer. after cell lysis, the solution was supplemented with oligo-dt coupled magnetic micro-beads and transferred to columns placed in a magnetic field for further processing. to selectively enrich mrna out of the total rna, cdna synthesis was performed with oligo-dt coupled magnetic beads. after on column cdna synthesis, beads with cdna were retained by centrifugation followed by 5′-tailing and pcr amplification. the size distribution of amplified cdna ranged from 200– <dig> base pairs. pcr products were fragmented by sonication to  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs and multiplex fragment library preparation was performed for paired-end illumina sequencing. figure  <dig> gives an overview of the developed methodology.

in this study we report data from sequencing of two hesc samples in the low sub-colony range  which were analyzed by  <dig> base pair paired-end sequencing on a single flow cell on an illumina hiseq instrument. we obtained  <dig>  million raw reads on a single lane, after barcode mapping for sample allocation we obtained  <dig>  million reads for rna-seq sample  <dig> and  <dig>  million reads for rna-seq sample  <dig> respectively. furthermore  <dig>  million reads belonged to whole genome sequencing performed for sample  <dig>  the rna-seq reads were mapped with tophat resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  million mapped reads  correspondingly. the number of duplicate reads was found to be  <dig>  % for the wga-dna sample and  <dig>  and  <dig>  % for the rna-seq sample  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. duplicate read counts were based on mapped reads with the same start and end point. in total  <dig>  refseq genes with a read coverage of ≥  <dig> reads were identified  in both hesc samples.

next imperative parameters for rna-seq were determined based on the refseq dataset, specifically the total length of mrna showing sequence coverage and coverage distribution along the 5'- to 3'-orientation. since we performed cdna synthesis by oligo-dt priming it is common sense to observe a bias towards the 3′-end of genes, especially for long transcripts . the median length of refseq cdnas observed were around 900– <dig> base pairs ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs  with single cdnas longer than 10 kb . the average coverage distribution along the 5'- to 3'-orientation of refseq genes was calculated for transcript size intervals of 0–1 kb, 1–2 kb, 2–3 kb, 3–4 kb, 4–5 kb and 5–15 kb. for transcripts in the range of 1–2 kb normalized coverage was almost 80 % over the full transcript length with decreasing coverage towards the last 15 % of bases at the 5′-end. for transcripts ranging from 2–5 kb normalized coverage was at least 50 % . subsequently we evaluated the correlation between both rna-seq samples. this was done by comparing fpkm values obtained for expressed refseq genes resulting in a pearson’s correlation factor of  <dig>  for rna-seq sample  <dig> and sample  <dig> .fig.  <dig> comparison of rnaseq data in terms of transcript identification. a read coverage across transcripts with coverage for transcripts of sizes 0 kb-1 kb, 1 kb-2 kb, 2 kb-3 kb, 3 kb-4 kb, 4 kb-5 kb and 5 kb-15 kb. transcripts were divided into  <dig> equally sized bins and coverage was averaged over all transcripts of the dedicated size interval. mean values of mrna sample <dig> and sample <dig> are displayed, error bars denoting standard deviation of samples. b boxplot of total length of sequenced refseq genes for rnaseq sample  <dig> and sample  <dig>  c correlation plot for rnaseq sample  <dig> and sample  <dig> in terms of fpkm values for expressed refseq genes



to further evaluate the rna-seq data we used expression analysis performed with an illumina beadarray with the same hesc line. the beadarray experiments were performed with the appropriate amount of mrna in comparison to the low input rna-seq experiments. a comparison of expressed refseq genes for both rna-seq samples and the illumina beadarray showed a high degree of concordance for both methods. for analysis only genes were included which gave rise to fpkm > <dig>  for ngs data and p-value < <dig>  in beadarray and were considered significant. in total  <dig>  genes were identified in both rna-seq samples whereas the beadarray identified  <dig>  genes. the total overlap between both sequencing experiments and the beadarray was found to be  <dig> refseq genes. moreover the overlap for rna-seq sample  <dig> and beadarray was found to be  <dig> and for rna-seq sample  <dig> to be  <dig>  respectively . next, a consensus pathway data base  overrepresentation analysis was performed to identify congruence of beadarray and ngs experiments in terms of overlapping genes and categories . significant genes from all experiments were analyzed in cpdb for categories using pathways from kegg, reactome, biocarta and wikipathways and compared for categories with a p-value threshold of  <dig> . in total  <dig> categories were identified for the beadarray experiment and  <dig> and  <dig> categories for rna sequencing sample  <dig> and sample  <dig> respectively. overall overlap for all experiments was found to be  <dig> and for beadarray and combined rna samples  <dig> categories. for rna sequencing sample  <dig> and rna sample  <dig> only the overlap was found to be  <dig> categories.fig.  <dig> overlap between microarray and sequencing measurements. a. <dig> venn diagram displaying overlap of significant genes found in the illumina microarray and next-generation sequencing  experiments. genes expressed with illumina detection p-value <  <dig>  in the microarray experiment or fpkm >  <dig>  in the ngs experiments were considered significant. genes were compared via hgnc gene symbol annotation. a. <dig> venn diagram displaying overlap of significant cpdb categories found in the illumina microarray and deep sequencing experiments. significant genes from microarray and ngs experiments were analysed with the cpdb functional annotation tool and categories with a q-value < <dig>  were considered significant. b pluripotency associated genes from microarray experiment and ngs experiments of sample <dig> and sample <dig> were compared. logarithmic values  of illumina average signals and fpkm values from expressed genes  were quantile normalized and subjected to cluster analysis via r heatmap <dig> function using euclidean distance as distance measure



to evaluate pluripotency of hesc samples in beadarray and rna sequencing experiments common pluripotency marker genes were compared. comparison was performed after normalization of gene expression by graphical representation analysis . the differential analysis of gene expression showed highest similarity between both rna samples followed by beadarray. analysis of expressed genes among all samples showed clustering of genes in groups of two for dnmt3b and cd <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog and pou5f <dig>  and ifitm <dig> with very similar gene expression in beadarray and both rna sequencing samples. examples of sequencing coverage for single pluripotency marker genes  as well as housekeeping gene  are shown in fig. 4b.fig.  <dig> read coverage of genome sequencing and rna-seq data. a read coverage of genomic dna is visualized in a manhattan plot showing coverage of 10 kb regions over chromosomes. b example of mapped reads for selected stem cell marker genes  and housekeeping gene  for both rna-seq samples  and wga dna sample . the aligned rna-seq reads resemble the exon structure depicted below



one inherent advantage of rna-seq over microarray-based analysis is the identification of splice variants and isoforms. hence both rna-seq samples were analyzed for expressed isoforms focusing on genes which are known to be important for the maintenance of the undifferentiated and pluripotent state of both hescs and induced pluripotent stem cells .table  <dig> detected isoforms of selected human embryonic stem cell marker genes

ultra-low input whole genome sequencing
the sequencing of dna was performed from the same sample as the sequencing of mrna. the dna contained in the human embryonic stem cells was collected during magnetic coupling of the mrna/oligo-dt complexes and before cdna synthesis was performed . the retained dna was subjected to phi <dig> mediated whole genome amplification  producing high molecular mass dna. the wga dna was subjected to sonication , followed by paired-end fragment library preparation and multiplex sequencing on the same flow cell as the mrna samples on an illumina hiseq instrument. in total  <dig>  million reads corresponding to the dna of sample  <dig> were obtained. from these  <dig>  million reads  could be mapped to hg <dig>  giving rise to an average 6-fold genome coverage. the coverage for individual chromosomes ranged from 3-fold coverage for the x-chromosome to 13-fold coverage for chromosome  <dig> respectively. furthermore chromosome coverage on a single base pair resolution was found to be ≥ <dig>  % for twelve chromosomes . lowest coverage was observed for the y-chromosome with  <dig>  % of sequenced bases. the average coverage for the full set of chromosomes was  <dig>  % sequenced base pairs. a sequencing coverage overview over all chromosomes is presented in fig. 4a.

discussion
to date the vast majorities of analyses of minute amounts of cell material down to single cells for next generation sequencing are still limited to either transcriptome or genome sequencing  <cit> . aiming the great advantages of a combined analysis, latest studies include different approaches for genome and transcriptome sequencing of the same cell  <cit> . within the pre-ngs era the analysis of single cells was performed by a combination of microarray-based techniques for gene expression and comparative genomic hybridization to study genomic aberrations from the same cell  <cit> . enabling a profound transcriptome as well as genome analysis by next generation sequencing from minute amounts of sample material will have many applications and will enable the study of rare cells. these rare cells may originate from cell-type specific differentiation of stem cells, but also from cancer tissue  <cit> , circulating tumor cells  <cit>  and early embryonic development  <cit>  amongst others. furthermore, it is known that micro-heterogeneity plays a fundamental role not only for stem cell function but for many biological processes  <cit> . having tools to dissect these micro-heterogeneities on a transcriptomic as well as genomic level can help to further understand the underlying function of biological processes and might become of clinical relevance not only in cancer therapies but also in personalized medicine like pharmacogenomics or prenatal diagnosis.

our results demonstrate that a combined transcriptome and genome analysis is feasible from minute amounts of sample material. sequencing was performed from 150– <dig> hesc which equals about 200 pg total rna according to the findings of islam et al.  <cit>  and about 1 ng of dna for a diploid genome. in our approach the developed method for combined transcriptome and genome sequencing generated robust and quantitative data for studying gene expression, isoforms etc. on one hand and the genome on the other hand. this appears an especially advantageous situation in the case of studying cancer where remarkable chromosome instability causes genome heterogeneity and is directly linked to alterations in transcriptome dynamics  <cit> . the effect of genomic copy number variations and snps on the transcriptome has been investigated with an integrative approach  <cit> . a further elucidation of the impact of genomic alterations on the phenotype of a cell can be analyzed preferentially by the presented method, where dna and rna are sequenced from the very same cell material.

obtaining full length coverage of expressed genes is vital for the identification of isoforms and splice variants. therefore we specifically evaluated the average coverage along refseq genes from the 5'- to the 3'-end. we found noteworthy variation in terms of average coverage from the 5'- to the 3'-end with significant more reads observed at the 3′-end of the transcript. hence our rna-seq data reflect a bias towards the 3'-end mainly attributed to the application of oligo-dt primed cdna preparation. this finding is in agreement with findings of other groups who analyzed minute amounts of sample material down to single cells  <cit> . other protocols offer highly multiplexed single-cell sequencing, nevertheless only a limited number of bases either from the 5'-end  <cit>  or the 3'-end  <cit>  are sequenced to enable mainly gene expression studies. the duplication rate for mapped reads found in both rna-seq samples is in line with comparable approaches eg by adiconis et al.  <cit>  where also an oligo-dt rna preparation was performed and a duplication rate for low input samples of ~20 %  and ~90 %  was reported. in their publication dey et al.  <cit>  do not present any information about duplicate reads observed in dnaseq and rnaseq, presumably due to their unique combined rna and dna amplification approach. the number of duplicate read counts observed by macaulay et al.  <cit>  ranged from  <dig> to <50 % for genome sequencing depending on cell line and cell number analyzed, unfortunately no read count for duplicate reads are given for rna-seq, only the number of total and mapped reads are presented. therefore the duplicate reads we found for rna-seq seem currently more or less normal, nevertheless it is desirable to reduce the number in future, to make sequencing more efficient.

purification of mrna from the much more abundant ribosomal rna using magnetic micro beads coupled to oligo-dt primers has become a widely established method in the last years. the recovery of complementary poly-t sequences is relatively high, whereas non-target rnas represent an insignificant part of the enriched molecules  <cit> . beyond the high target selectivity, the practicability and short assay duration of the method, further advantages are its compatibility to modifications. it has been shown that chemical conditions can also be changed to preserve proteins in their native state for further proteomic analyses  <cit> . however, the abovementioned 3′ skew bias has been faced in different approaches, like the cdna transcription using smarter  <cit>  or the additional mrna enrichment by its 5′cap  <cit> . the latter procedure also deals with the intricate capturing of mrnas with short poly-a tails since its length might be influenced in the course of translational control  <cit> . some new protocols avoid a physical separation of rna from dna because it might be detrimental when automatic liquid handling is conducted in small volumes. in such approaches, the oligo-dt primer contains an additional barcode sequence to identify the amplified cdna within the pool of genomic dna  <cit> . the limitation of all methods using oligo-dt primer to target polyadenylated mrna is the inability to detect micrornas or lncrnas, which are also of importance for the transcriptome and the cell’s phenotype.

all current ngs platforms require prior amplification of dna if minute amounts of dna are analyzed. novel approaches specifically utilized for single-cell whole genome amplification promise an improved genome coverage  <cit> . however, compared to established methods locus dropout is still observed and comparable to the results we obtained for whole genome sequencing. alternatively a transposon-mediated library preparation strategy omitting any amplification reaction prior to ngs library preparation  <cit>  may offer an alternative approach for the method presented here.

several aspects of the presented method offer room for improvement. beyond the separation of the mrna the preparation of amplified cdna as well as wga dna involves many discrete steps which are prone for technical variation, such as the magnetic coupling and binding of mrna to the column, the elution of dna from the column, the pcr amplification of the double-stranded cdna and library preparation which adds another step of pcr amplification. secondly, retaining full length coverage of expressed rnas in ultra-low input preparations is especially challenging. furthermore locus drop out on the genomic dna is more likely to occur with decreasing cell numbers within the wga reaction. all these technical challenges are exacerbating if the cell number is decreased down to single cells and all currently available methods need to cope with  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion the presented approach for combined ultra-low mrna and whole-genome sequencing from minute amounts of starting material offers new possibilities for many applications where limited material is available. furthermore it enables one to directly study both the transcriptome and genome in one analytical approach from the same sample material which might be of interest for both basic as well as clinical research.
