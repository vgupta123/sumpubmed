BACKGROUND
rice is the most important cereal staple for more than half the world’s population. as a primary dietary source of carbohydrates, it plays an important role in meeting energy requirements and nutrient intake among the rice eating populations  <cit> . cooked rice is readily digested because it contains higher proportions of digestible starch  and a lower rs  <cit> . rs has been reported by many studies to play an inhibitory role in the interaction of α amylase a predominant starch metabolising enzyme in human gut, with the carbohydrates in many cereals including rice resulting in slow digestibility of starch  <cit> . rs in cereal grains is reported to be the functional equivalent of dietary fibre through many animal studies .

in the past, dietary carbohydrates have been derived from whole coarse grains of rice, which were loaded with sufficient dietary fibre. at present, they are replaced predominantly with milled white rice carbohydrates devoid of any dietary fibre . studies involving human subjects related to the assessment of the causative factors for high prevalence of type ii diabetes in asia had indicated the consumption of milled white rice as one of the major factor . the uninhibited interaction of α amylase with the carbohydrates from milled white rice leading to rapid release of glucose in the blood stream was demonstrated as the mechanism for diabetes incidence in many animal studies .

increasing the rs levels in the endosperm of cereal staples including rice is envisaged as an essential target for quality improvement of their starch in the context of human health  <cit> . characterisation studies of cereal starches with high rs had indicated two major biochemical components to be positively associated with this desirable fraction. studies of miller et al.  <cit> , leeman et al.  <cit>  and lehman and robin  <cit>  had provided conclusive evidences for positive correlation of amylose with rs enhancement. while other characterisation studies in cereals had demonstrated that increased proportion of short chains and decrease in intermediate and long chain amylopectin also play a vital role for increase in rs content  <cit> .

in rice, it is surprising to note that many of the indica varieties in spite of their intermediate to high amylose content   in their grains do not show much reduction in their starch digestibility and remains rapid in their glycemic response  <cit> . findings of chung et al.  <cit>  based on their study of rice varieties with varied amylose contents clearly indicated that apart from ac the higher proportion of short chain amylopectin is also a critical factor for reduction in digestibility of starch. this warrants the need for exploration of rice varieties with high ac along with increased proportion of short chain amylopectin to reduce its glycemic response.

natural allelic variants are more stable in their expression as compared to induced mutations, as they are generated and stabilised over their long course of evolution  <cit> . the classical example of isolation and use of path breaking natural gene variants is the discovery of dwarfing genes such as dee-geo-woo-gen in rice and norin  <dig> in wheat which led to the green revolution during 1960s  <cit> . recently, the isolation of sub- <dig> gene leading to the development of submergence tolerant rice varieties is also a demonstration of the discovery and use of natural allelic variants from germplasm  <cit> . as the natural variants occur in an extremely low frequency, the power of allele mining to discover them has to be enhanced by applying modern genomic tools. genomics assisted allele mining approaches when applied in reverse genetic mode results in enhanced power of detection and provides scope for high throughput screening of large germplasm in a short time frame  <cit> . isolation of natural sequence allelic variants in targeted candidate genes has been successfully demonstrated through ecotilling in many plants such as arabidopsis  <cit> , banana  <cit> , populus  <cit> , field bean  <cit> , mung bean  <cit> , barley  <cit> , potato  <cit> , cucumis spp  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit>  and also in rice  <cit> .

the conventional tilling and ecotilling methods using celi endonuclease based heteroduplex cleavage are less effective and labour intensive, hence very challenging in employing them in large mutant and germplasm dna pools. to overcome the difficulties of conventional tilling approach, tsai et al.  <cit>  demonstrated tilling by high throughput sequencing in large mutant populations of rice and wheat. recently, tilling by sequencing was also been employed for the identification of allelic variants responsible for abiotic and biotic resistance in peanut  <cit> .

in the present investigation, we employed ecotilling by sequencing of candidate genes for the discovery of potential nucleotide variations associated with low glycemic response in rice. our candidate gene selection was based on the studies of sestili et al.  <cit> , regina et al.  <cit>  and satoh et al.  <cit>  in wheat, barley and rice mutants generated through gene silencing and knock out technologies. these studies reported many potential loss of function mutations in the genes coding for starch synthases  and starch branching enzymes  associated with the enhancement of rs.

from  <dig>  kb of ecotilling regions spanning in six candidate genes,  <dig>  natural variants were discovered . out of the  <dig> snps, transitions accounted for  <dig> numbers each of t → c and g → a, followed by eight numbers of a → g, and six numbers of c → t. seven transversions each of t → g and c → a followed by three numbers of t → a, two of g → c and one of a → c were observed. all the  <dig> single base indels discovered were deletions.

prediction of deleterious variants
the positional analysis of the nucleotide variants indicated that  <dig> % of them were in the exons and  <dig> % were present in introns. further functional analysis of the exon mutations indicated that  <dig> % were silent and  <dig> % were deleterious variants. the predicted deleterious variants along with their deconvolved accessions were furnished in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  four sequence variants observed in the gbssi gene were regarded as null mutants as they were synonymous for amino acid changes. seven variants of ssi gene were exon residing snps, which included two missense and five silent variants. the amino acid substitutions predicted viz., glycine → serine at 319th residue in the accessions os- <dig> and os- <dig> and tyrosine → histidine at 420th residue in the accessions os- <dig>  os- <dig> and os- <dig> resulting from single base substitutions g3538a and t4127c, respectively were found to be deleterious with sift scores of  <dig> . two out of the four snps discovered in ssiia gene  were missense variants and both were predicted as deleterious with sift score of  <dig>  and they resulted in amino acid changes glycine → serine at 604th residue in accessions os- <dig> and os- <dig> and valine → methionine at 737th residue in the accessions os- <dig> and os- <dig>  respectively. furthermore, a single base deletion  was also found to be deleterious in the accession os- <dig> which resulted in frame shift. in the gene ssiiia, a single nucleotide variant  borne by the accessions os- <dig>  os-  <dig> and os- <dig> resulted in the alteration of amino acid valine to glutamic acid at 843rd position of the protein was also deleterious. even though there were eight sequence variants observed in sbeia and sbeiib, none of them were predicted to be deleterious to protein function by sift analysis.table  <dig> deleterious and synonymous variants discovered in the candidate genes through ecotilling by sequencing

all the deleterious variants in this investigation were predicted with sift , a powerful bioinformatic pipeline that predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function or not. it works with an algorithm which accounts for the tolerance of amino acid substitutions with relation to their physical properties. the predicted sift score ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  the amino acid substitution is predicted to be damaging if the score is <  <dig> , and tolerated if the score is >  <dig> .

discussion
in this investigation, we attempt to unravel genetic factors responsible for slow digestibility of rice starch in order to utilise them in breeding this popular cereal for health benefits. recently the reverse genetic approach, tilling when performed with high throughput sequencing was very effective for detection of mutations in large rice and wheat mutant populations  <cit> . eco-tilling, also a reverse genetic method derived from the principles of tilling is very useful for high throughput discovery of rare alleles in naturally evolved populations  <cit> . in this study, we employed ecotilling by sequencing for the first time in rice germplasm to discover rare alleles associated with slow starch digestibility.

in this investigation, we had discovered  <dig> natural variants representing  <dig> snps and  <dig> single base indels by exploring  <dig>  kb of target gene sequences in  <dig> germplasm accessions. among the candidate gene targets, we observed remarkably higher number of sequence variants  in the genes coding for starch synthases than that of starch branching enzymes . similar trend in variant frequencies was reported by kharabian-masouleh et al.  <cit>  wherein  <dig> variants in starch synthases and only  <dig> variants in starch branching enzymes were discovered in  <dig> rice breeding lines. high frequency of natural variants observed in starch synthases is postulated to the ability to compliment the loss of function of mutant forms by a wild type allele and vice versa. in contrary, the genes coding for starch branching enzymes possess non-redundant function hence lack the potential for complementation was demonstrated in arabidopsis  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> .

enhanced expression of short chain amylopectin was demonstrated to be associated with low glycemic response in many cereals  <cit> . an earlier study in rice revealed that a knock out mutant of ssi gene was observed to produce altered amylopectin composition in rice endosperm with a tendency for enhanced short chains without affecting the grain morphology and test weight  <cit> . two natural ssi allelic missense variants isolated for the first time in this study, g3538a substitution with a glycine → serine alteration at 319th amino acid residue in the gemplasm accessions os- <dig> and os- <dig> and t4127c substitution with tyrosine → histidine at 420th residue in three accessions os- <dig>  os- <dig> and os- <dig> are expected to carry potential for altered short chain amylopectin composition. these natural allelic variants of ssi gene could be deployed for development of non-transgenic rice cultivars with lower glycemic index .

in a comparative study between indica and japonica cultivars, nakamura et al.  <cit>  found that all the japonica accessions carried a serine residue instead of a glycine residue found in indica types at the 604th amino acid position resulting from a g3797a substitution in ssiia gene. upon characterization for their length of amylopectin, they found an increased proportion of short chain of dp 6– <dig> and decreased longer amylopectin chains with dp13- <dig> in all the japonica cultivars carrying this variant. the same g3797a substitution was discovered in the indica accessions of os- <dig> and os- <dig> for the first time in this study. this allele could also be deployed in indica rice breeding programmes for reducing gi in rice. furthermore, the potential missense single base deletion variant  resulting in a frame shift leading to loss of glycine residue at 592nd amino acid position could also be a potential allele for altering the glycemic response in rice.

the gene expression pattern analysis in many studies using japonica rice suggest that ssiiia plays an important role during the starch filling phase of the developing endosperm by its contribution towards amylopectin synthesis . it has been reported that the deleterious mutations in this gene can cause inefficiency in grain filling which results in loosely packed starch with high chalkiness  <cit> . in contrary, fujita et al.  <cit>  characterized two mutants of ssiiia in japonica background through protein quantification studies. they found that the reduced activity of ssiiia in the mutant endosperm was accompanied with a compensatory enhancement of gbssi and ssi activities in both the mutants. in these mutants, they also reported a significant increase in the molar ratio of short chain amylopectin in comparison to their longer counter parts. in the accessions os- <dig>  os- <dig> and os- <dig>  we had discovered a missense variant  which resulted in the alteration of amino acid valine to glutamic acid at the 843rd position of the protein. these accessions were characterized to be free from chalkiness . lack of chalkiness in these accessions could be postulated to the compensatory mechanism of gbssi and ssi which are reported to exhibit multi-fold expression in indica varieties leading to no or less yield penalty. such a compensatory mechanism is also evident in the control mutants rsm  <dig> and rsm  <dig> with normal grain size and morphology without chalkiness in spite of being carriers of three and four deleterious variants in ssiiia gene, respectively.

the grains from  <dig> germplasm accessions carrying deleterious variants were subjected to biochemical analysis for determination of rs content and digestibility of starch through in vitro enzymatic studies . amylose content, an important parameter positively associated with rs expression, varied from intermediate to high . absence of low and waxy amylose types can be attributed to the lesser or no deleterious variants in the gbss i gene which is commonly observed in indica rice varieties. as gbss i is the only gene postulated to govern amylose synthesis in rice  <cit>  hence complementation for loss of function mutations is remote unlike in the case of other starch synthases  governing amylopectin synthesis.

test accessions in this study revealed considerable variation for rs  and hi  in spite of the lesser variation in ac. in contrary to many investigations in germplasm of cereals  which had indicated positive correlation of ac and rs, their association in this study was negative . the reason may be that the previous studies had representative accessions in all ac classes including low amylose and waxy types.

it is interesting to note that amylose independent variation observed in the rs and hi among the intermediate and high ac types was found to be dependent on the number of variants harboured in each of the ss coding genes and also on number of genes that carry the variants. for example, in the control cultivar pooja which do not harbour any variant in the ss coding genes recorded lowest rs content  and highest hi . the six accessions  carrying variants in a single gene expressed moderately higher values of rs  and hi , whereas the accessions  with variants in two genes expressed high values of rs  and relatively lower hi . the accessions  with variants in all the three ss coding genes were found to possess very high rs value  and very low in hi . the hydrolysis index  is an in vitro biochemical determinant that estimates the rate of starch digestion of starchy food stuffs  <cit> . various authors have suggested in vitro starch hydrolysis methods can be useful for predicting in vivo glycemic response of starchy staples  <cit> .

an earlier study in rice had indicated that each ss coding gene plays a partially overlapping role in the synthesis of amylopectin fraction of starch. zhang et al.  <cit>  by repression of genes through rnai established that ssiia and ssiiia interact with each other during starch synthesis leading to accumulation of amylopectin with variable molecular forms. in this investigation, we have isolated, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time a genotype os- <dig> carrying mutations in all three ss coding genes viz., ssi, ssiia and ssiiia which also exhibited very high levels of rs  and extremely low hi  with a possible predominance of short chain amylopectin. this has to be proven by determination of the degree of polymerization  of amylopectin of this elite germplasm line. the dp of amylopectin is a numerical indicator of chain length in terms of the number of constitutive monomeric glucose molecules. it determines many physico-chemical properties of grain starch which includes retrogradation behaviour, pasting and swelling properties, gelatinization temperature along with enzymatic digestibility . many studies had indicated that the fine structure of amylopectin can alter the digestibility rate of starch in rice. yang et al.  <cit>  in their study with rice mutants high in rs was found to exhibit an increased proportion of short chain amylopectin as compared to the proportion of long chains. shu et al.  <cit>  based on their study with six rice mutants with altered fine structure of amylopectin also established the similar relationship between rs content and increased proportion of short chain amylopectin with dp ≤  <dig>  critical analysis of the structural chemistry of amylopectin in the genotype os- <dig> will also provide concrete evidence for the postulated relationship between amylopectin fine structure with rs and starch digestibility.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ecotilling by sequencing is a robust tool to survey allelic variants in target genes across large germplasm panels in rice. our discovery of accessions with multiple missense variants in genes encoding starch synthases has the potential to reduce the glycemic response of rice starch.
