BACKGROUND
advances in high-throughput dna sequencing techniques have made it possible to follow the within-host genomic evolution of bacterial pathogens by comparing genomes of longitudinally collected bacterial isolates sampled from human hosts  <cit> . the genomic information may be used to understand pathogen population diversity, host adaptation, and routes and sources of transmission.

pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis  patients represents an infectious disease scenario in which within-host genomic evolution of clonal lineages of infecting bacteria can be followed by making genomic comparisons of clonal isolates sampled over time  <cit> . a number of clinical collections of freeze-stored p. aeruginosa isolates from cf patients have been genome sequenced to investigate pathogen microevolution. this includes investigation of within-host evolution of p. aeruginosa lineages isolated from cf patients from argentina, canada, denmark, germany, united kingdom, and united states, respectively . nonetheless, to obtain a more complete basis for understanding p. aeruginosa infections in cf patients and to facilitate comparative studies to assess the generality of findings, it is necessary to investigate more clinical collections of p. aeruginosa. in order to serve as references, such investigations should be as comprehensive as possible, for example by including both genomic, phenotypic, and clinical information.

here, we report the first genomic analysis of p. aeruginosa isolates sampled from italian cf patients, aiming to compare whether within-host evolution of p. aeruginosa in italian cf patients resembles what has been found in other countries.

in total, we sequenced  <dig> isolates sampled over a period of 19 years from four different patients. genomic comparisons showed that the  <dig> isolates belonged to six different clone types , which we named it01-it <dig>  each clone type was found to infect a single patient, except for clone type it <dig> that was shared among three patients.

we conducted both an inter-clonal genomic analysis to determine the genetic relationship between different strains, and an intra-clonal genomic analysis to reveal within-host microevolution of the individual clonal lineages. we correlated the genetic changes with changes in relevant phenotypes and patient treatment. finally, we compared the findings from this study of evolution of p. aeruginosa in italian cf patients to the findings from similar studies encompassing lineages and patient cohorts from other countries. altogether, continued genome sequencing of bacterial pathogens will improve our understanding of within-host genomic evolution, transmission, and population genomics.

RESULTS
collection of p. aeruginosa isolates from italian cf patients
in order to investigate the within-host genomic evolution of p. aeruginosa lineages infecting cf patients, we performed a retrospective study of a collection of p. aeruginosa isolates from four patients attending the cystic fibrosis center at anna meyer’s children university hospital . the four patients named e, f, h and l were all born in the beginning of the 1990s , and they had their first colonization by p. aeruginosa within the first three years of life. the first and subsequent lung isolates of p. aeruginosa from the four patients were all stored to yield a collection of  <dig> isolates sampled over a time period of 19 years  .fig.  <dig> collection of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. a information about p. aeruginosa isolates collected from patients e, l, f, and h. at genotype refers to the genotype code determined by arraytube multimarker microarray. b longitudinal overview of samples



the ability of p. aeruginosa to cause infection in cf patients is not pertained to a single or a few strains  of p. aeruginosa, and cf children are anticipated to acquire their first p. aeruginosa infection from environmental strains that are naïve to the human airways. accordingly, many different and unique strains are observed to infect cf patients . while the early p. aeruginosa infections may possibly be eradicated, it is commonly observed that the same clone type persist in the airways of cf patients, and a single clone type is typically observed to be dominant  <cit> . in order to identify such persistent lineages, we typed the  <dig> strains using the arraytube multimarker microarray targeting  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the core genome and additional genetic markers in the accessory genome  <cit> . arraytube genotyping revealed that all four patients harbored reoccurring genotypes . the reoccurrence of identical bacterial genotypes in the same patient likely reflect that strains persist in the airways of the patients  <cit> . alternatively, the reoccurrence of identical genotypes may be due to independent re-colonization from the same environmental source.

genome sequencing of isolates to determine genetic relationships
to further elucidate the possibility that p. aeruginosa lineages persisted within the airways of the patients, we genome sequenced  <dig> of the isolates to investigate their genomic relationships . genome sequencing confirmed that isolates of the same genotype were closely related , and we name these clonal lineages it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  and it <dig>  only one isolate of arraytube genotype 2c1a was sequenced, and we name this strain it <dig> 

isolates of the same lineage differed at most by  <dig> snps , and on average  <dig> snps separated clonal isolates. most diversity was present among isolates of the it <dig> lineage , whereas almost no snp differences were observed between isolates belonging to lineage it <dig> .

transmission of the it <dig> lineage between patients
lineages it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  and it <dig> were found to infect only a single patient , suggesting that the patients had picked up the respective lineages from the environment. contrary, lineage it <dig> was found in both patients f, h, and l, suggesting that the it <dig> lineage had spread among the patients by either direct patient-to-patient transmission or indirect transmission via a common environmental reservoir. interestingly, the it <dig> lineage is the first clone type of p. aeruginosa to be isolated from all three patients in years  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. however, in all cases other clone types of p. aeruginosa replace the it <dig> clone type. we speculate that the it <dig> lineage reside in a common environmental source to which the patients are frequently exposed, enabling the it <dig> lineage to successfully colonize multiple patients, but that the it <dig> lineage in the long run is replaced by other clone types that are inherently better to thrive in the patients’ airways.

phylogeny and mutational signatures
next, we compared clonally related genomes to reconstruct the evolutionary history of each of the clonal lineages . the mutations in each of the lineages accumulated in a highly parsimonious fashion , reflecting a unidirectional and clonal evolution since the most recent common ancestor. thus, using a maximum-parsimonious phylogenetic model, we were able to make accurate inferences about the succession of mutations and the relationship among p. aeruginosa clones.fig.  <dig> phylogeny and selected phenotypes of pseudomonas aeruginosa lineages it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  and it <dig>  maximum-parsimonious phylogenetic trees were constructed by paup* . size of swimming, swarming, and protease clearing zones relative to reference strain pao <dig> are indicated by colors. presence of mucoid phenotype is denoted by ‘+’. ciprofloxacin susceptibility is indicated by ‘s’ , ‘i’ , or ´r´ 



general conclusions about to what extent natural selection has been the driving force in the fixation of genetic variants, can be inferred from measuring the relative rates of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  genetic changes  <cit> . a dn/ds ratio greater than one implies that there has been an overall positive selection for mutations; whereas a ratio less than one implies that there has been a selection for removal of mutations, i.e. negative selection. however, note that the dn/ds ratio should be interpreted as an average signal of selection not giving any information on if both positive and negative selection has acted at different sites and/or times during the evolution. we found a significant signature of negative selection in lineages it <dig>  and it <dig> , whereas the dn/ds ratios in the other three lineages were neither significantly positive nor negative . our observed range of dn/ds from  <dig>  to  <dig>  is in accordance with previous findings of within-host microevolution to be affected by both negative  <cit>  and positive selection  <cit> .

furthermore, we performed bayesian analyses of mutation rates, and we estimated the yearly rate of snp mutations in it <dig> lineage to be  <dig>  snps/year   <dig> – <dig>  snps/year), which is equivalent to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> snps/year per site. this means that the mutation rate of the it <dig> lineage is almost identical to the within-host mutation rate  estimated for the dk <dig> lineage evolving in chronically infected danish cf patients  <cit> . also, the rate is within the range of mutation rates estimated in a number of other studies: snyder et al. reported a mutation rate of  <dig> - <dig>  snps/year during a hospital outbreak  <cit> ; markussen et al. found the dk <dig> lineage to accumulate  <dig>  snps/year in a chronically infected danish cf patient; and cramer et al. estimated the mutation rate of lineage pa <dig> to be ~ <dig> snp/year over the course of infection of a german cf patient  <cit> . mutation rates of the other lineages  could not be estimated since the number and temporal distribution of isolates were insufficient to obtain proper estimates of the mutation rates  of modeled parameters were below 10).

positive selection for mutations in pathoadaptive genes
genetic adaptation is hypothesized to play a major role in the successful establishment of chronic p. aeruginosa infections of cf patients , and marvig et al. recently performed a genome-wide mutational analysis of  <dig> different p. aeruginosa lineages to identify  <dig> candidate ‘pathoadaptive genes’ targeted by mutations to optimize pathogen fitness  <cit> . we found that  <dig> of  <dig> identified intragenic mutations were located within the  <dig> candidate pathoadaptive genes, corresponding to an 11-fold enrichment of mutations in these particular  <dig> genes relative to all other genes  ~ pois =  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  where λ is the expected number of mutations in  <dig> genes). this suggests that the mutations in the pathoadaptive genes have been positively selected in the host airways. in agreement with this, we found a significant mutational signature of positive selection of snps in pathoadaptive genes  whereas snps in the remainder of genes showed a signature of negative selection . mutations in pathoadaptive genes includes nonsynonymous mutations in acef, algu, bifa, gyra, gyrb, lasr, mexa, mexb, mexz, mora, muca, nfxb, pvds, and rets.

furthermore, several other of the mutations accumulated in lineages it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  it <dig>  and it <dig> may as well confer a selective advantage. for example, the exact c to t phur promoter mutation  found in isolates f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig> has previously been shown to increase the expression of the pseudomonas heme uptake  system; an adaptive trait shown to improve the uptake of iron from host hemoglobin  <cit> . also, loss-of-function mutations in rpon have frequently been found to be typical markers of cf lung infection  <cit> , and in this study we found an rpon frameshift mutation in it <dig> strains h <dig> and h <dig> 

finally, we identified an a2058g mutation and a c2611t  mutation in the 23s rrna gene in the it <dig> lineage  and the it <dig> lineage , respectively. the exact mutations have previously been shown to confer macrolide resistance in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that the mutations have been selected due the use of azithromycin in clinic , and in accordance with this the mutations were not observed until after the start of oral azithromycin treatment of the respective patients.

genetic relationship between it01-it <dig> lineages and other p. aeruginosa strains
next, we sought to determine the genetic relationship between lineages it01-it <dig> and other genome sequenced strains of p. aeruginosa. we de novo assembled the genome of the earliest isolate of each of the six clonal lineages and aligned the genomes to a panel of  <dig> genome sequences of other strains of p. aeruginosa. the panel consisted of eight completed genomes of p. aeruginosa reference strains , and  <dig> incomplete draft genomes of strains dk01-dk <dig>  which we recently genome sequenced in a study of danish cf patients  <cit> .

using the harvest suite  <cit> , we aligned the panel of genomes and constructed a phylogenetic tree based on  <dig>  snps identified in the core genome of the aligned strains . clustering of genomes based on core genome snps confirmed previous findings that, except for a few outlier strains , strains group into two major phylogenetic clusters containing strains pao <dig> and pa <dig>  respectively   <cit> . we observed no evidence that the geographical linked strains it01-it <dig> grouped more closely in the phylogenetic tree. however, we noted that strains it01-it <dig> all belong to the phylogenetic cluster containing strain pao <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree based on core-genome alignment of different pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. genomes of the earliest isolate of each of the lineages it01-it <dig> were aligned against a panel of  <dig> genome sequences of other strains of p. aeruginosa. a tree showing the phylogeny of all isolates. b subset of tree showing phylogeny of all isolates, except the outlier isolate pa <dig>  strains are either named after their lineage  followed by the name of the specific isolate in parenthesis, or by the name of the reference strains  followed by ‘ref’ in parenthesis. phylogenetic tree was constructed using harvest  <cit> 



genetic distances between closely related isolates from different countries
we found that the it <dig> and it <dig> lineages were closely related to isolates of the dk <dig> and dk <dig> clone types, respectively , which have been isolated from danish cf patients  <cit> . the close genetic relationship was also supported by multilocus sequence typing  analysis, showing the it02/dk <dig> strains to be of sequence type st- <dig> and the it03/dk <dig> strains to be of sequence type st- <dig> 

to further investigate these two cases, we repeated the phylogenetic analysis, now only including the relevant isolates . note, since both clone types dk <dig> and dk <dig> were found in multiple patients in the study of the danish patients, we included the earliest isolate from all the respective patients in our analysis . interestingly, we found that more diversity was present between isolates from denmark relative to the diversity present between isolates from italy and denmark . for example, only  <dig> snps separated the italian isolate h <dig> from isolate  <dig> sampled from a danish cf patient , whereas danish isolates of the same clone type were different by up to  <dig> snps  .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees based on core-genome alignment of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains of the it02/dk <dig> and it03/dk <dig> clonal complexes. phylogenetic trees were constructed using harvest  <cit> . name, patient origin, and year of isolation are shown for each isolate in parenthesis



host adaptation is associated with reduction in metabolic capacity
finally, we sought to investigate the phenotypic changes that occurred during the course of infection. reductions in metabolic capacity, for example caused by rpon mutations, have previously been associated with host adaptation  <cit> , so we used phenotype microarrays  to characterize the metabolic capacity of three strains from each of the lineages it <dig>  it <dig>  and it <dig>  the metabolic capacities of isolates of both lineages it <dig> and it <dig> decreased over time , whereas no change was observed for lineage it <dig> over 4 years of infection .fig.  <dig> changes in metabolic capacities over time relative to pseudomonas aeruginosa reference strain pao <dig>  number of substrates metabolized better or worse than pao <dig> was measured using biolog phenotype microarrays 



mutants with loss-of-function mutations in the cbrab two-component system is known to be unable or poor at utilizing a large range of carbon and nitrogen sources  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that two nonsynonymous mutations accumulated in cbrab may explain the loss of metabolic capacity in isolates h <dig> and h <dig> of the it <dig> lineage.

in the it <dig> lineage, several mutations may explain the reduced metabolic capacities of isolates e <dig> and e <dig> from years  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, relative to the ancestral isolate e <dig> from  <dig>  both isolates e <dig> and e <dig> accumulated nonsynonymous mutations in genes acef, dgcb, gcdh, glcd, glnd, and vana belonging to pseudocap function classes ‘amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism’ and/or ‘carbon compound catabolism’. in addition, isolate e <dig> harbor mutations in genes cysb, pdxj, pa <dig>  sdha that are involved in biosynthesis of amino acids, biosynthesis of cofactors, amino acid transport, and central metabolism, respectively. we suggest that the mentioned mutations may explain the reduction of metabolic capacity in the it <dig> lineage.

changes in mucoidity, motility, ciprofloxacin susceptibility, and protease production
besides reduction in metabolic capacity, the cf lung infection is associated with the appearance of a number of other phenotypes of which many are not usually observed among environmental, wild type isolates of this species. for example, mucoid colony formation, reduction in secretion of extracellular proteases, loss of flagella dependent motility, and antibiotic resistance are characteristics of isolates from chronic cf infections .

we phenotypically characterized the  <dig> isolates of clone types it01-it <dig> and it05- <dig>  and in accordance with previous studies, we found that nearly all isolates exhibited reduced swimming and swarming motility and protease secretion relative to the wild type-like reference strain pao <dig>  <cit>  . the only isolates showing swimming and/or swarming capabilities better than pao <dig> were l <dig>  f <dig>  and h <dig>  furthermore, three of the patients  harbored mucoid isolates, and the two latest isolates of the it <dig> lineage  were resistant to ciprofloxacin.

the relative large numbers of mutations that appear in each of the clonal lineages make it difficult to associate specific mutations with phenotypic changes. nonetheless, only mutations gacs and gaca, respectively, discriminated isolates f <dig> and h <dig> from the other isolates of the it <dig> lineage. in agreement with literature  <cit> , this suggest that the mutations in the gacas two-component regulatory system is the cause of increased motility and decreased extracellular protease activity of isolates f <dig> and h <dig>  furthermore, we suggest that a gyra mutation, which has previously been associated with ciprofloxacin resistance  <cit> , explains ciprofloxacin resistance observed in isolates h <dig> and h <dig>  also, we suggest that mucoidity of isolates e <dig> and e <dig> may be caused by a nonsense mutation in muca present in these two, but no other, isolates of the it <dig> lineage.

in the it <dig> lineage, a reduction of extracellular protease activity in isolates h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> coincides with the fixation of a missense mutation in lasr encoding a regulator required for the expression of virulence-associated extracellular proteases lasa and lasb  <cit> . in the same isolates, we suggest a loss of swimming motility to be caused by a missense mutation in fleq encoding a positive regulator of flagella biosynthesis genes  <cit> .

discussion
we have gained insight into p. aeruginosa infections using a collection of isolates sampled over 19 years from four italian cf patients. we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> of the isolates and correlated identified mutations to changes in relevant phenotypes and antibiotic treatment used in the clinic. while there are several other clinical collections of p. aeruginosa that have been genome sequenced  <cit> , this is the first genome analysis of isolates from italian cf patients. we therefore anticipate that our study may serve as a reference for future research and helps to obtain a more complete basis for understanding p. aeruginosa infections in cf patients.

we found the genomic evolution of lineages from italian patients to resemble the evolution of p. aeruginosa lineages from other countries. this included similar observed rates of mutation and evidence for host-associated selection for mutations in pathoadaptive genes. accordingly, our results support previous findings of significant mutational signature of positive selection in relatively few pathoadaptive genes in contrast to neutral change in the large remainder of genes. inter-study parallelism of mutations in the same pathoadaptive genes may by part be driven by similarities in antibiotic treatment regimes. however, we also found parallelism of mutations in genes that are not directly associated to antibiotic resistance , and this may reflect similarities in host-dependent selective forces.

unlike other studies , we did not identify hypermutable lineages. since our study only encompasses four patients, the lack of hypermutators may be accidental, and hypermutators may eventually appear as these are observed more frequently in late stage infections  <cit> .

patients were predominantly infected with strains unique to the particular patient. one exception was clone type it <dig> which was shared by three patients. despite of it05’s occurrence in multiple patients, the it <dig> clone type resembled a wild type phenotype, and this may explain why other clone types with typical host-associated phenotypes replace it <dig> in all patients. as such, the pattern of strain replacement may be due to initial infections from a strain that reside in a common environmental source to which the patients are frequently exposed, and that this strain is subsequently replaced by other more rare, but also more fit, strains.

while other studies have given insight into p. aeruginosa within-host population diversity  <cit> , further investigations are needed to make conclusions about the diversity of p. aeruginosa in our four patients. however, we conducted an inter-clonal genomic analysis to determine the genetic relationship between lineages it01-it <dig> and a panel of  <dig> genome sequenced strains of p. aeruginosa from other countries. hereby, we showed that lineages it <dig> and it <dig> were closely related to lineages dk <dig> and dk <dig>  respectively, which have been isolated from danish cf patients  <cit> . since more diversity was present between isolates from denmark relative to the diversity present between isolates from italy and denmark, our findings show that one must be cautious of using genome analysis to infer the country origin of lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first whole-genome analysis of p. aeruginosa isolated from italian cf patients, and together with both phenotypic and clinical information this dataset facilitates a better understanding of p. aeruginosa within-host genomic evolution, transmission, and population genomics. this may help the design of future intervention strategies for the clinical setting.
