BACKGROUND
mitochondrial aaa-proteases  are evolutionary conserved atp-dependent metalloproteases that participate in the assembly of the respiratory chain complexes and ribosomes, and in mitochondrial protein quality control  <cit> .

in mice, two oligomeric aaa-protease complexes are present in the mitochondria inner membrane: the i-aaa protease, formed by the yme1l <dig> protein, oriented towards the intermembrane space, and the m-aaa protease, composed by paraplegin , afg3l <dig> and afg3l <dig>  which exposes its catalytic site to the matrix. it has been recently shown  <cit>  that the m-aaa-protease formed by paraplegin has a hexameric structure like ftsh, a better studied bacterial homologue of eukaryotic m-aaa members . in humans, spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> only are active genes, whereas afg3l <dig> has become a pseudogene. both spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> have been associated with a human neurodegenerative disease: spg <dig> loss-of-function mutations cause an autosomal recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia   <cit> , in which axons of corticospinal neurons and of somatosensory neurons degenerate  <cit> ; afg3l <dig> missense mutations have been implied in the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia sca <dig>  <cit> . a mouse model for paraplegin deficiency has a motor phenotype that appears at  <dig> months, and later shows clear features of axonal swelling and degeneration of motor descending and sensory axons  <cit> . recently two murine models for afg3l <dig> have been described, one carrying a null mutation, and a second with a missense mutation in the protease domain. afg3l <dig> defective mice display a marked impairment of axonal development leading to lethality at p <dig>  <cit> . mice homozygous for spg <dig> deletion, which in addition also bear the loss of function afg3l2emv <dig> mutation in one allele, display a more severe phenotype with an earlier onset of symptoms when compared with spg <dig> null mice, and they also develop a marked cerebellar ataxia  <cit> .

in yeast, yta <dig> and yta <dig> are the functional orthologues of paraplegin and afg3l <dig>  since respiratory competence defects induced by deficiency of both yta <dig> and yta <dig> are compensated by coexpression of paraplegin and afg3l <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of afg3l <dig> is sufficient to rescue respiratory competence in this model while paraplegin alone fails to restore m-aaa function, in line with the finding that afg3l <dig> can form homo-oligomers while paraplegin does not  <cit> .

recently the assembly of paraplegin in m-aaa complexes has been studied in paraplegin deficient hsp fibroblasts and in fibroblast from spg <dig> -/- mouse model. different amounts of paraplegin, afg3l <dig>  and afg3l <dig> proteins were seen in liver and brain, with afg3l <dig> being the less abundant in the latter. the subunit composition of the proteolytic complex seems therefore to vary in different tissues, and possibly within different subregions  <cit> .

it is therefore interesting to evaluate the relative expression levels of the three murine m-aaa components in the brain to further correlate their abundance with the neurodegenerative pathologies associated with spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> genes in humans. to this aim, we measured the relative expression of m-aaa genes by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  in the whole brain and in specific regions ; furthermore, a detailed pattern of expression was studied by in-situ hybridization under conditions which allowed each probe a sufficient resolution between neurons with different degrees of expression. the combination of rt-pcr quantification with in-situ hybridization data allows us to make a reliable comparison of the expression levels of the m-aaa transcripts for the first time.

RESULTS
in-situ hybridization analysis of m-aaa protease transcripts in the mouse brain
to study the expression of m-aaa genes at a single cell resolution, we used non-radioactive in-situ hybridization. the results of this analysis for the most relevant brain regions are reported in table  <dig>  it should be noted that the scoring of expression levels with in-situ hybridization was relative to the highest intensity of labeling obtained by each probe, so that the levels can be compared only within each gene but not between genes. the ratio of expression levels across the three genes can be derived taking into account at the same time in-situ hybridization data together with quantitative rt-pcr results .

intensity of labeling of in-situ hybridization: - indicates absence of labeled structures; + mild labeling; ++ moderate labeling; +++ intense labeling. the scoring was relative to the highest intensity of each probe, so that the levels can be compared only within each gene but not between the three genes analyzed.

we noted a wide variability of expression. a virtual absence of labeling was found in the neurons of the cerebellar cortex molecular layer, whereas a very intense labeling was present in the cerebellar purkinje cells and in brainstem motor neurons. in the olfactory bulb, the expression was intense in the principal cells of the mitral cell layer, while the glomerular layer showed a moderate expression and the granule cell layer a barely detectable signal. granule neurons of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurons of all hippocampal regions showed a moderate to high expression of all transcripts . in contrast to the other two genes, afg3l <dig> was also clearly expressed by hippocampal interneurons, including those located in the hilus, in stratum oriens, in stratum radiatum and in stratum lacunosum-moleculare .

all layers displayed a moderate to intense labeling in neocortex , including sparse cells present in the most superficial layer, more abundant with afg3l <dig>  the most salient difference of expression was a more pronounced labeling of layer  <dig>  especially for afg3l <dig>  the level of expression was low in the striatum while in the thalamic nuclei it was moderate.

in the cerebellum , the molecular layer was devoid of labeling, purkinje cells were very intensely stained and in the granule cell layer middle-sized neurons, presumable golgi cells, displayed a very high expression, which contrasts with the low labeling of the small sized granule cells. it is noteworthy that also neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei were densely labeled, especially for spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> 

in the brainstem, vestibular nuclei expressed all three genes at a moderate level. pontine nuclei, one of the main sources of mossy fiber afferents to the cerebellum, were not stained for spg <dig>  but had a moderate to high expression of afg3l <dig> and afg3l <dig>  the neuronal type, which displayed the highest levels of expression of all three transcripts in the brainstem, were motor neurons of cranial nerves, including those located in the nuclei innervating oculomotor muscles , trigeminal motor nuclei  and facial motor nuclei . somatosensory cuneate and gracile nuclei also expressed the three transcripts, at a slightly lower level than brainstem motor neurons.

quantitative expression of m-aaa protease transcripts in mouse brain regions and in purkinje cells
the relative expression levels of spg <dig>  afg3l <dig> and afg3l <dig> were measured by real-time rt-pcr in the mouse whole brain and in specific regions manually dissected . data were calibrated using the housekeeping gene pgk <dig>  <cit> . in the whole brain, afg3l <dig> had an expression level, relative to pgk <dig>  of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , spg <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and afg3l <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . in all analyzed regions, afg3l <dig> was always found to be the most abundant transcript, afg3l <dig> the least expressed, whereas spg <dig> displayed an intermediate level of expression .

for all transcripts we found the highest levels in the cerebellum . besides this region, the neocortex had an expression of spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> higher that the average of the whole brain, but showed the smallest amount of afg3l <dig> transcript . these results indicate the presence of some regional differences in the expression of the m-aaa genes. the quantification was very reproducible across individuals, indicating a stable area-specific expression of m-aaa protease transcripts.

in the cerebellum the prevalent population of neurons are granule cells, which express low levels of afg3l <dig> and spg <dig>  since it has been recently reported that afg3l <dig> is involved in the sca <dig> spinocerebellar ataxia  <cit> , in which it is likely that purkinje cells are affected, it is interesting to quantify the relative level of expression of these cells relative to the average cerebellar expression. in the whole cerebellum , the expression level, relative to a housekeeping gene , was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for afg3l <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for spg <dig>  in order to analyze the level of expression in purkinje cells extracted from slices of cerebellar tissue, the cdna contents of  <dig> purkinje cells were pooled together in order to obtain a constant and reliable amplification. in purkinje cells  the expression of both genes was more than fourfold relative to the cerebellar average, yielding  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for afg3l <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for spg <dig>  which are significantly higher than for the whole cerebellum . this analysis was not extended to afg3l <dig> because the lower levels of expression of this gene precluded a reliable quantification in purkinje cells.

discussion
mutations in the mitochondrial m-aaa protease genes cause two different neurodegenerative diseases in humans: loss of function of spg <dig> is associated with an autosomal recessive form of spastic paraplegia  <cit> , whereas missense mutations in afg3l <dig> have recently been associated with sca <dig>  <cit> .

the expression of the three m-aaa genes , evaluated by in-situ hybridization in the mouse brain, was nearly ubiquitous; only a few structures displayed an almost complete lack of expression, like the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. such a diffuse presence in neurons is in agreement with an essential role for the m-aaa complex for neuronal function. an enriched expression of m-aaa genes was noted for neurons with large cell bodies, like mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal cells, purkinje and deep nuclei cells in the cerebellum, and brainstem motor neurons. a similar pattern has been reported for other mitochondrial proteins, and it might be related to a higher requirement for mitochondrial function in large sized neurons  <cit> .

a relative quantification of gene expression between the three m-aaa genes was performed by real-time rt-pcr, given that the in-situ hybridization technique only allows us to compare the expression of each gene in different cell types. in the whole brain, the proportion of afg3l1: spg7: afg3l <dig> mrna was about 1:3: <dig>  as suggested by previously reported western blot experiments  <cit> . the allen brain atlas http://mouse.brain-map.org/ contains information consistent with our results, but with a faint labeling for spg <dig> and without the possibility to directly compare the levels of expression of the three m-aaa genes. our real-time rt-pcr data are in agreement with a lower expression of spg <dig> relative to afg3l <dig>  but with a moderate ratio of 3: <dig>  in accordance with our in-situ hybridization data. furthermore, the moderate to high expression of spg <dig> in cortical neurons and in motorneurons is more in line with the neuronal damage observed in spg <dig> null mice  <cit>  and in paraplegin deficient patients  <cit> . our data, combining rt-pcr quantification with in-situ hybridization, provide the first reliable comparison of the expression levels of the m-aaa transcripts, which is not directly possible with either technique alone.

in our real-time rt-pcr study, afg3l <dig> was the most expressed m-aaa gene in all analyzed brain regions, in agreement with the result that afg3l <dig> can form both hetero-complexes with paraplegin or afg3l <dig>  and homo-oligomers  <cit> . overall, the higher abundance of afg3l <dig> suggests a more important role for this protein than for spg <dig> and afg3l <dig>  indeed, mice lacking functional afg3l <dig> display severe motor deficits, leading to paraparesis and tetraparesis at p12- <dig>  followed by death within p <dig>  <cit> . a marked reduction of axonal diameter of cortico-spinal and peripheral nerve fibers is the most striking alteration accompanied by signs of axonal damage and demyelination. the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex i and iii is reduced, and the cytoplasm of motorneurons, dorsal root ganglia and cerebellar purkinje cells contains clusters of clear vacuoles of possible mitochondrial origin.

afg3l <dig>  a pseudogene in humans, is expressed at low levels in all brain regions analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr. this low level of expression and the non complete overlap of expression pattern with the other m-aaa genes, may explain why in both spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> knock-out mouse models afg3l <dig> is not able to complement the lack of any of the two paralogues  <cit> . we also suggest that the presence of afg3l <dig> should not be relevant in mouse models for sca <dig>  where a knock-in afg3l <dig> is necessary, due to the fact that all patients reported carry a missense mutation .

spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> are expressed in the cell types related to hsp and sca <dig>  respectively: spg <dig> is highly expressed in neocortical pyramidal cells and in motor neurons, and afg3l <dig> is highly expressed in cerebellar purkinje cells. despite the fact that, in purkinje cells, spg <dig> is expressed at similar levels as afg3l <dig>  in sca <dig> the function of mutated afg3l <dig> cannot be substituted by paraplegin, in line with the inability of paraplegin to form homo-oligomers  <cit> . the high expression of afg3l <dig> in brainstem motor neurons may also relate to the ophthalmoparesis, which is often present in patients with sca <dig>  <cit> . however, we found that m-aaa genes are also expressed at high levels in cell types not directly involved in the corresponding human pathology, suggesting pathogenetic mechanisms not simply based on reduced function but on more subtle alterations.

CONCLUSIONS
in the mouse brain, afg3l1: spg7: afg3l <dig> are expressed at relative levels of 1:3: <dig>  the expression is high in neurons, which are affected in neurodegenerative pathologies associated with spg <dig> and afg3l <dig> genes in humans. however, taken together, our results indicate that the neurons affected in hsp and sca <dig> do not express selectively spg <dig> or afg3l <dig> respectively, nor show the highest brain levels of their relevant transcripts. this suggests that the reason of the cell-specific effect of spg <dig> or afg3l <dig> mutations cannot be attributed to selective or particularly high expression levels in a given cell type, but to other still unknown mechanisms.
