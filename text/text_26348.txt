BACKGROUND
when bacteria are inoculated into fresh medium, they often show a period without growth known as the lag phase  <cit> . lag phase is interesting as a fundamental biological process in which bacterial physiology adapts to a new environment. lag phase is also of interest in fields such as food safety- in which lag phase is one factor in determining food shelf life  <cit> . in medicine, lag phase plays a role when bacteria move into the blood stream or other locations where rapid growth can occur. in both food safety and medicine, the longer the lag phase the longer body defenses have time to fight pathogens, and the longer the natural gut flora have to out-compete the pathogens. in some cases, longer lag phase is associated with increased invasiveness of bacterial cells  <cit> , or with antibiotic tolerance  <cit> .

there are several definitions of lag phase  <cit>  -see additional file 1: table s <dig> for details. for clarity, we divide lag phase into two sub-phases: lag <dig> is the period between inoculation and until biomass begins to grow, and lag <dig> is the period between the end of lag <dig> and the time that cell numbers begin to increase . lag <dig> has also been called the adaptation phase  <cit> , a term we do not use because of the multiple meanings of adaptation in sensing and evolution. note that lag <dig> is not adaptation by mutation, but rather acclimatization of the cell physiology to new conditions. the name 'lag2' is contradictory in the sense that it is a phase of growth, namely the first cell generation. we however chose this name to describe the second part of the lag phase because cells do not grow in number, which is why previous works considered this phase to be part of lag phase.

operationally, the length of lag <dig> phase is determined in a logarithmic plot of biomass or a related quantity  by extrapolating the exponential growth of biomass and finding its intersection with the initial biomass . the end of lag <dig> can be similarly defined from a logarithmic graph of cell numbers .

when cells are grown overnight in a rich medium and then transferred to a poor medium, both lag <dig> and lag <dig> phases may occur. mathematical models of lag phase include baranyi’s model  <cit>  in which biomass production relies on accumulation of bottleneck proteins in lag phase  <cit> , and models which focus on cell-cell variation in lag phase duration  <cit> . each individual cell has lag <dig> and lag <dig> phases, but the duration of these phases varies stochastically between individual cells, as is evident in the measurements of métris et al.  <cit>  . one possible origin of these cell-cell variations is stochastic variation in the levels of enzymes present in the cell  <cit> .

individual cell measurements also show that the cell cycle accelerates during the first few divisions  <cit> , and thus it takes several generations to reach the maximal exponential growth rate. thus, lag <dig> as defined here is only the first generation in a prolonged acceleration phase  <cit>  .

studies of gene expression in bacterial lag phase are relatively few  <cit> . several studies have focused on particular genes, such as the transcription regulator fis <cit>  and ribosomal genes  <cit> . a recent study explored the genome-wide expression patterns of salmonella typhimurium upon transition from stationary phase in rich medium  to fresh lb medium  <cit> . in this case, bacteria seem to make biomass almost immediately , making it difficult to resolve lag <dig> phase. the expression program in lag <dig> was similar to expression in exponential growth, with some differences in genes related to metal ion accumulation, phosphate accumulation and oxidative stress. thus, current knowledge is greatest for lag <dig>  the phase in which biomass grows, suggesting that it is similar in many ways to exponential phase.

in contrast to lag <dig>  there is little knowledge about lag <dig> phase, the phase in which biomass does not grow. this lack of knowledge is due in part to the technical difficulty of studying lag <dig>  and in part to the fact that commonly used protocols go from rich medium to rich medium so that lag <dig> is very short. it is therefore not clear whether the expression program in lag <dig> is fundamentally different from the expression in lag <dig> and exponential growth. for example, one may imagine several possibilities: either no expression in lag <dig> of any gene, expression that is directed only towards selected genes, or expression of the same genes as in exponential phase but at low intensity.

here, we address the nature of lag phase by developing an assay for measuring cell size, cell number and promoter activity at high accuracy in individual bacterial cells in lag <dig> and lag <dig> phases. this assay allows us to overcome the problem of low signal to background that occurs in culture-based assays of lag phase that rely on fluorimeters for optical density  and fluorescence measurements. we found that the expression program in lag <dig> phase is very different from that in lag <dig> and exponential phases. most promoters are not measurably active in lag <dig> phase. the promoters of the utilization operons for the specific carbon source in the medium are, however, highly active in lag <dig> phase showing an exponential increase with time, despite the fact that biomass does not measurably increase. in lag <dig> and exponential phase, utilization genes, ribosomal genes and a wide range of growth genes are expressed together. this suggests a ‘bang-bang’ control strategy, known from optimal control theory in engineering: first concentrate resources on generating utilization genes for the specific carbon source, so that carbon can flow into energy production and building blocks , and only then make ribosomes to produce biomass. the seemingly inert lag <dig> phase thus shows selective and strong expression of specific genes.

RESULTS
flow cytometry assay on fluorescent reporter cells allows differentiation between bacterial lag <dig> and lag <dig> growth phases
to measure promoter activity, we used strains from the e. coli reporter strain library previously developed in our lab  <cit> . each strain bears a low-copy plasmid with fast folding gfp under the control of a full length copy of the promoter of interest.

a technical challenge for studying lag <dig> is low cell density: one cannot use the reporter strains to measure promoter activity during lag <dig> phase in a culture using a multi-well fluorimeter, because cell density and fluorescence is below the background detection limit  <cit> . one can use a high inoculum level  to bypass the od detection threshold, but this can affect lag phase duration and behavior due to the relatively high concentration of stationary phase stimulatory and inhibitory molecules  <cit> , and due to quorum sensing  <cit> . thus, we developed a flow cytometry assay to measure fluorescence and cell size from individual cells grown in batch culture .

to prepare the cells for flow cytometry at multiple time points after inoculation, we used a robotic liquid handling system to transfer cells from stationary phase culture to 96- deep well plates in a time-delayed manner. wells were inoculated at varying temporal intervals, ranging from  <dig> to 180 minutes. at the end of this procedure, the multi-well plate had cells grown in fresh medium for different amounts of time post inoculation, ranging from zero to 15 hours. cells were kept on ice and measured in flow cytometers, so that samples represented a post-inoculation time course.

we used flow cytometry to measure cell number and individual cells' fluorescence. by viewing individual cells, flow cytometry overcomes the signal to noise problems of low density batch cultures. we measured total cell density by the number of cytometry counts at a given time point. this measurement of cell density agreed very well with colony-forming-unit measurements on agar plates .

we also measured cells in an imaging flow cytometer, which provides images of individual cells. these images allowed a direct measurement of cell length. we used cell length to operationally define the end of lag <dig> phase, at the intersection between the initial cell length line at the beginning of the curve, with the extrapolated exponential increase in cell length in lag <dig> . the end of lag <dig> is operationally defined using the cell number curve: it is the intersection of the cells' exponential growth line with the line of initial cell number . the end of exponential phase is similarly defined as the intersection between the exponential growth line and the line of final cell density .

we studied cells transferred from a stationary phase culture in defined m <dig> medium with glucose  and casamino acids , into fresh m <dig> medium with no casamino acids in which a given sugar  is the sole carbon source at saturating  concentrations . as a control, we also studied cells inoculated into fresh m9cglu. we found that for m9ara, a significant lag <dig> phase was seen lasting for 3 ± 1 hours . after the lag <dig> period, cells began to grow in length and entered lag <dig>  the duration of lag <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours. thus lag1 + lag <dig> lasted for  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours. when cells entered exponential phase, the rise in cell numbers coincided with the plateauing of mean cell length . this is because cell divisions prevent a further rise in mean cell length. the exponential growth rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hour- <dig>  corresponding to a generation time of 55 ± 5 minutes.

in contrast, transfer to the richer medium with glucose and amino acids  showed immediate growth in cell size, and thus cells entered lag <dig> without a measurable delay . here, the rise in cell number is also coupled to the peak of mean cell size . the duration of lag <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours, the exponential growth rate is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hour- <dig>  and the exponential generation time was 29 ± 8 minutes. when cells entered stationary phase, their mean length decreased back to its pre-inoculation level .

in lag <dig> phase, genes for arabinose utilization are expressed exponentially with time despite no growth in biomass
we measured the fluorescence of the reporter cells for genes related to arabinose utilization in fresh m9ara medium. we found that the fluorescence of the arabinose utilization genes rises exponentially with time during lag <dig> and lag <dig> phases. the reporters for the catabolic operon arabad, and the transporters arae and arafgh, show an exponential rise in fluorescence despite no measurable increase in biomass in lag <dig>  arabad expression rose by a factor of about  <dig> over the eight hours of lag1 + lag <dig>  , corresponding to an exponential rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hour- <dig> and a doubling time of 92 ± 4 minutes. similarly, arae showed an exponential increase of about  <dig> fold, at rate  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hour- <dig>  this doubling time is nearly twice the cell doubling time of 55 ± 5 minutes in exponential phase in the same medium. as cells leave lag <dig> phase and begin to divide, these reporters reach a steady-state of fluorescence levels, because cell divisions dilute the gfp produced by these promoters.

one possible explanation for the exponential rise in reporter fluorescence during lag <dig> is an auto-catalytic process in which cells devote their gene expression resources to utilizing the sugar; the more transporters available, the more the sugar can be utilized giving rise to more expression and so on.

individual cell data from the flow cytometry experiment indicates that the expression of the arabinose system promoter increases with time for all cells, and is not an all-or-none phenomenon in which some cells express the operons and others do not .

in lag <dig> phase, growth genes are not measurably expressed
we also tested ribosomal promoter activity in m9ara medium, using relevant reporter strains . we found that ribosomal reporters did not show an appreciable rise during lag <dig> phase in arabinose . when cells began to grow in size , the ribosomal promoters were activated . this lag <dig> increase appears mild in the case of rrnb due to its relatively high initial level. the promoters began to approach a steady-state activity levels in exponential phase, when their mean gfp production rates are balanced by the dilution rate due to cell division.

we also tested amino-acid biosynthesis promoters for arginine, phenylalanine and serine . we found that these promoters were not measurably active during lag <dig> on arabinose , even though the medium did not contain amino acids. these promoters became active only in lag <dig>  rising at different rates, approaching a steady-state in exponential phase.

we tested catabolic genes for other sugars, rhamnose, maltose and lactose . we found that these promoters were also not measurably active in lag <dig> or thereafter . thus, cells seemed to selectively express the utilization genes for the nutrient in the medium  in lag <dig>  and not utilization genes for other sugars.

to extend our survey of promoter activity in lag <dig> phase, we performed a screen using  <dig> additional promoters, with diverse biological functions, in m9ara medium. the promoters controlled genes involved in translation, transcription, global regulators, amino acid biosynthesis, oxidative stress, phosphate and metal transport and metabolism, cold shock, heat shock and global stress . to allow a large screen, we used fewer time-points: three in lag <dig> and one in lag <dig> phase. no growth related promoters  showed a measurable promoter activity. genes with a significant increase in lag <dig> were re-tested at higher temporal resolution. we find that only one promoter reproducibly showed more than a 3-fold increase during lag <dig>  the oxidative stress promoter katg . however, it does not rise as rapidly as the arabinose promoters. we also found a minor increase in some of the iron metabolism and transporter promoters .

when cells were inoculated into glucose and amino acid medium , instead of arabinose, they skipped lag <dig> and entered lag <dig> immediately. we found that the arabinose utilization promoters were not active during lag <dig> or exponential phases, and slightly rose at stationary phase when glucose is depleted and camp rises . ribosomal promoters were active immediately after inoculation, during lag <dig> and exp. phase . the amino-acid promoters were mostly activated towards the end of the exp. phase, when the medium ran out of amino-acids .

results are consistent with optimal control principle of ‘bang-bang’ control
taken together, these results suggest that in lag <dig> on arabinose, cells mostly focus their promoter activity on the arabinose utilization genes. they do not activate the vast majority of promoters, including ribosomal genes, amino acid biosynthesis genes or utilization genes for other sugars.

this is analogous to the control theory strategy known as bang-bang control. a bang-bang strategy posits that in order to produce a given amount of output in minimal time, invest first in producing the limiting component only, and then switch abruptly to making the other elements in the system. this is in contrast to a different strategy in which one makes all components at a given ratio throughout time. in lag <dig>  cells devote their resources to making specific utilization proteins, and then, in lag <dig>  switch to making ribosomes together with more utilization genes. to ask whether this strategy is optimal for making the most cells at a given time t after inoculation, we analyzed a mathematical model based on baranyi's model for bacterial growth  <cit> . the model, outlined in figure  <dig>  provides equations for the production of a bottleneck enzymes p which provide the substrates for producing biomass m . one seeks the best way to temporally allocate production resources between making p and making m, in order to double the biomass in minimal time.

the model can be exactly solved, using an optimal control method known as pontryagin's maximum principle  <cit> . the exact solution shows that the optimal allocation is to first make only p- as in lag <dig>  and then switch to making both p and m- as in lag <dig> . this conclusion applies to a wide range of models and parameters and is not sensitive to the details of the equations used  <cit> .

the exact solution  suggests that the lag phase duration depends on the initial level of bottleneck enzyme p
0
. the smaller p
0
, the longer the lag phase because it is advantageous to spend time to produce p
0
 in order to increase the subsequent rate of biomass production ). if p
0
 exceeds a critical amount, p
0c
, it no longer becomes optimal to have a lag <dig> phase – the optimal τ equals zero . instead, the cells immediately begin lag <dig> and produce biomass. this can explain why for some sugars, such as glucose, lag <dig> phase is not observed. if there are sufficient glucose utilization enzymes in the initial cells, it is better to skip lag <dig> and begin growth immediately.

the model has three parameters, two of which can be estimated directly from the data: the exponential growth rate μ ~  <dig>  hr- <dig> and the bottleneck protein exponential increase rate ν ~  <dig>  hr- <dig>  from these, and the observed duration of lag <dig> phase, τ ~ 3 hr, one can estimate the initial bottleneck enzyme level in the arabinose experiment: using the formula τ=1νinνμp0in <dig>  indicating a low initial enzyme concentration of p
0
 ~  <dig>  .

finally, the model also suggests how different individual cells might vary in their lag <dig> phase duration. it is known that individual cells differ in the concentration of any given protein, an effect known as protein expression noise  <cit> . cell-cell variations in the initial bottleneck enzyme level p
0
 will thus result in different lag <dig> durations. usually, the distribution of protein concentrations across cells is well described by a gamma distribution  <cit> , which resembles quite closely a log-normal distributions when protein copy number is not too low. indeed, our flow cytometry measurements of the arab reporter strain show approximately log-normal distributions at early times . because lag phase duration goes as the logarithm of p
0
, the model predicts that cell-cell variation in lag duration will roughly follow a normal distribution ). this prediction agrees with observed distributions of lag times  <cit> .

discussion
we found that the seemingly inert lag <dig> phase shows exponentially increasing activity of a few specific promoters. to observe this, we developed an assay using e coli reporter strains, which were imaged during flow cytometry, to measure promoter activity in lag phase. using this experimental system, we were able to follow cell size and promoter activity dynamics over the bacterial growth curve. this allowed clear distinction between the two lag sub-phases: lag <dig> and lag <dig> 

with arabinose as the carbon source, we found that gene expression in lag <dig> phase  is very different from gene expression in exponential phase and lag <dig> phase . it is also different from expression in stationary phase before inoculation. in lag <dig>  the genes needed to utilize the specific carbon source in the medium  are expressed with exponentially increasing dynamics, despite the fact that biomass does not measurably increase. the exponential rate of expression in lag <dig> phase is nearly 2-fold slower than the exponential rate of cell growth in exponential phase. utilization genes for other sugars are not expressed. general growth genes such as ribosomal genes are not expressed in lag <dig> phase, and begin to be expressed only in lag <dig> when cell biomass increases. amino acid biosynthesis genes are also not expressed in lag <dig> phase on arabinose. in a screen of  <dig> diverse promoters, the only other promoter that rises sharply above its initial level is the oxidative stress promoter katg. the resulting picture resembles the engineering principle of bang-bang control  <cit> , in which resources are devoted exclusively at first to the bottleneck proteins to provide carbon and energy for growth, and only later, at lag <dig>  expression switches to a full growth program  <cit> .

one may interpret the exponential rise in expression of utilization genes in lag <dig> phase by considering a positive feedback process. after inoculation from stationary phase, the cell contains very few transporters and utilization genes for sugars such as arabinose. the influx of arabinose into the cell is low, and ribosomal production is prevented by the stringent response system  <cit> . the cells seem to utilize their meager initial resources  <cit>  to primarily make new utilization genes: arabinose transporters and catabolic enzymes. in turn, due to these transporters and catabolic genes, arabinose influx increases, expression increases in turn, and an auto-catalytic process occurs. the exponential rate of this process is presumably determined by the rate constants of the transporters and enzymes, and the elongation rate of the translation machinery at low nutrient levels. when the cell has enough amino acids to unlock stringent response, ribosomal production ensues together with biomass growth and exit from lag <dig> .

a very short lag <dig> phase is expected to be found in fresh media in which cells already express the relevant utilization genes at high levels in stationary phase. for these sugars, such as glucose in the present study, the cell comes prepared for almost immediate growth. it would be of interest to study the evolutionary circumstances that lead cells to choose in which sugar systems to invest during stationary phase.

these findings relate also to theoretical models for lag phase dynamics, such as baranyi's model  <cit> , which are widely used in the food safety field to estimate lag phase duration in a given food product. baranyi's model assumes that the cells in lag <dig> produce a set of enzymes p at an exponential rate ν, which provide building blocks for biomass production. the present findings may be interpreted as identifying the enzymes p as the sugar utilization genes . in many implementations of baranyi's model to describe population growth curves, it is assumed for simplicity that the exponential rise in the enzymes p occurs at the same rate as the later exponential increase in biomass denoted μ   <cit> . the present finding suggest that in the case of arabinose, p rises exponentially but at a different  rate than the exponential rise in cell number . this finding can lead to refinements of modeling for better predictions of lag phase duration.

the abrupt switch from lag <dig> with its specific expression program to lag <dig> with its general growth program may be interpreted in light of optimal control theory. under a wide range of conditions, in order to achieve the greatest final product , it is optimal to first make only the limiting resources in lag <dig> , and then abruptly switch to making all of the biomass production machinery in lag <dig> . mechanistically, this switch might be implemented by the unlocking of stringent control. a similar strategy is found in wasps that need to allocate resources between making workers and making reproductive individuals  <cit> . wasps first make only workers, which bring in nutrients, and then, a few weeks before winter, switch to making reproductives . another example is found in development of the mouse gut, where stem cells make an abrupt transition between symmetric and asymmetric divisions, which has been suggested to be the fastest way to reach the desired number of differentiated cells  <cit> .

future work can extend the present approach to more genes, to fully map the expression strategy in lag phase. it would be important to develop further methods to measure protein quantities required to start the division cycle, in order to develop mechanistic models for bacterial growth phases. testing the role of stringent response in lag <dig> phase, and evolutionary experiments to change lag phase duration  <cit>  can help identify genes and regulation important for this process. another interesting topic is the role of cell-cell variation in lag phase: stochastic effects will result in different individual bacteria making the bang-bang switch at different times  <cit> . such studies will require following individual cells and their promoter activity over time.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we developed a method to explore e. coli gene expression in lag phase. we distinguish between lag <dig> phase in which there is no visible growth, and lag <dig> in which cells grow but have not yet divided. when arabinose is the sole carbon source, the vast majority of promoters are inactive in lag <dig>  except for the promoters for the carbon source in the medium  which are activated with exponentially increasing dynamics. in lag <dig>  e. coli switches abruptly to a full growth program of promoter activity. this behavior is consistent with a bang-bang control strategy of allocating resources to making bottleneck components first in order to optimize biomass production over time.
