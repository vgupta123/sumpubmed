BACKGROUND
generalized born models
electrostatic effects arising due to the interaction of solute charges among themselevs and with solvent and ion charges, are of utmost importance for biomolecular structure and function. continuum methods based on the poisson-boltzmann equation have been widely used for calculating electrostatic effects  <cit> . in the last decades much interest has been devoted to developing fast approximations to the solution of the poisson-boltzmann  equation.

onufriev and coworkers have developed an analytical approximation to the exact potential inside and outside the low dielectric region of a sphere  <cit> , that performs surprisingly well also for the complex shape of proteins  <cit>  and is therefore more general than the generalized born  models.

when only self- and interaction energies and forces are sought, the most widely used approach is based on generalized born  models. recent reviews summarize the approach and highlight most interesting recent results  <cit> .

central to these models is the estimation of polarization charge contributions to: i) the self-energy of each charge ; ii) the interaction energy of each pair of charges.

by equating the estimated reaction field Ûireact at the ith charge qi to the reaction field at a spherical ion in solution with the same charge, each charge is assigned an effective radius which is called the born radius .

  αi=1Ûireactqi4πε01εout-1εin 

once born radii have been estimated the interaction energy between any two charges is computed as the sum of a direct coulomb term  and a solvation term which is, according to still et al.  <cit> , Δgsolv= ∑i,jΔgsolv,ij with:

  Δgsolv,ij=-18π1εin-1εoutqiqjrij2+αiαjexp-rij24αiαj 

this expression was found to be more accurate than the exact expression for two charges embedded in a conducting sphere, although the coefficient of  <dig>  instead of  <dig>  in the exponential has been suggested  <cit>  and other similar forms have been proposed  <cit> .

computation of born radii
born radii could be in principle computed by solving a system of linear equations for the polarization charges at the boundaries of the solute volume  <cit> . under the approximation that the ionic solution provides complete screening, amounting to the assumption that the surface behaves like a grounded conductor, polarization charges at the surface are such that the integral of their electric field at any outer surface point is exactly the opposite of the source charge field. this approximation amounts to setting εout = ∞. in a different context the same approximation has been proposed many years ago as the conducting surface model   <cit>  and successfully used since then. under this condition it is possible to obtain simple formulae for the generalized born radius for a low dielectric region delimited by a sphere or a plane. the reaction field satisfies laplace equation inside the surface and the solution may be obtained solving the equation using suitable basis functions with dirichlet boundary conditions at discretized points on the surface  <cit> .

these methods are however slower than approximate methods. the computation of born radii is performed by volume or surface integrals. an approximation that has been widely used is the coulomb field approximation, where the formula for the electrostatic displacement for a uniform medium is applied in the inner and outer regions using the inner and outer dielectric constant, respectively. born radius in this approximation does not depend on the inner and outer dielectric constant, but rather becomes a purely geometric quantity. the volume integral formulation of the coulomb field approximation is turned into a surface integral formulation using the divergence theorem  <cit> . the coulomb field approximation corresponds to neglecting the contribution to polarization at the surface due to polarization charges and to considering therefore the electric field inside the surface as due only to the source charge:

  e →=qi4πε0εin×||r →s-r →i|| <dig> 

under the assumption of grounded conducting surface the outer field is zero and the polarization charge at the surface point r →s is given by gauss' theorem:

  σ=-qi4π×⋅n →||r →i-r →s|| <dig> 

where n → is the unit vector normal to the surface at point r →s and pointing outwards.

the reaction field at the source charge will be equal to the integral of the fields due to surface charges at the source charge, i. e.:

  uireact= ∫ sσ4πε0εin||r →i-r →s||ds=qi4πε0εin∫⋅n →||r →i-r →s||4ds4π 

the reaction field may be used to compute the born radius according to equation  with εout = ∞. the coulomb field approximation for the grounded conducting surface has the advantage that the integral of the surface polarization charges will be always equal to the opposite of the charge inside the surface as for the exact solution. on the other hand it gives a very bad approximation both of polarization charges, which depend only on the distance from the source charge and on the normal to the surface, and reaction field energies even for simple systems. although the coulomb field approximation is reasonable, grycuk has pointed out that it is fundamentally inaccurate for charges embedded in a sphere  <cit>  by comparing both the self energy computed under the coulomb field approximation and the pair interaction energy computed using the formula by still and coworkers  <cit> , with the exact solution obtained by using the kirkwood model  <cit> . based on the analysis for charges embedded in a sphere an exact formula is provided which may be recast as a function of a surface integral:

  uireact=-qi4πε0εin∫ s⋅n →||r →s-r →i||6ds4π <dig> 

from which the integral expression for the generalized born radius follows:

  αi=1∫ s⋅n →||r →s-r →i||6ds4π <dig> 

the above expression which will be referred hereafter as gbr <dig> following grycuk  <cit>  and tjong and zhou  <cit> , has been analysed in detail by mongan et al.  <cit> . equation  <dig> was found to perform extremely well also for "very" non spherical shapes and in the context of biomolecular models. occasional large differences with respect to poisson-boltzmann calculations were found for inner cavities and local concavities at the surface, i.e. in conditions where a continuum model is anyway questionable. that study concluded that with a correction for a small systematic error, the gbr <dig> model is a sufficiently accurate continuum electrostatic model  <cit> .

tjong and zhou  <cit>  used an analytical implementation for the estimation of born radii based on volume integrals  that uses a surface integral instead) and showed its superior accuracy compared to other existing methods for a set of  <dig> very different proteins. in their approach it is made clear that standard estimations of born radii compute in fact only geometric properties, and they provide empirical formulae for the correct born energy depending on the inner and outer dielectric constants, ionic strength, total charge and number of atoms.

although successful and theoretically correct for a charge inside a grounded conducting sphere, there is no reason why equation  should provide good estimation of born radii for complex shapes like those of proteins and biomolecules in general. in general born radii could be estimated using integrals of the form :

  in= ∫ s14π⋅n →||r →s-r →i||n+1ds 

in the absence of a theory which could be cast in a fast computational framework, fitting approaches have been successfully followed and tested on large sets of proteins showing excellent agreement with poisson-boltzmann calculation results. romanov et al.  <cit>  proposed that a linear combination of integrals i <dig> to i <dig>  in the present notation, and a constant term could fit the self-polarization energy and thus be used to compute generalized born radii .

applications of the generalized born model
based on the correct estimation of born radii, the solvation contribution to the interaction between any two charges may be computed by using equation . derivation of equation  with respect to atomic positions gives the electrostatic solvation forces acting on atoms. the implicit dependence of born radii on atomic positions makes computation of forces far from trivial  <cit>  for the generalized born model as well as for the parent poisson-boltzmann model where the boundaries depend on atomic positions  <cit> . the possibility of computing energies and forces faster with respect to the reference poisson-boltzmann equation has made the generalized born model the choice of election for implicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. also, the computation of pairwise solvation energies allows for fast computation of pka of multiple titrating groups as we discuss in the methods section.

applications of generalized born model  have been reviewed elsewhere  <cit> . at variance with the reference poisson-boltzmann model, the computation of electrostatic potential in space is outside the scope of the generalized born model where only interactions are considered thorugh equation  <dig>  here we use a finite radius test charge in order to define a potential within the frame of the generalized born model.

aim of this work
in the present work we provide a software that, based on generalized born radii, provides most common electrostatic analyses of proteins. the program first computes generalized born radii, via surface integrals, based on different definitions and then it uses generalized born radii  to perform electrostic analyses. in particular the ouput of the program entails, depending on user's requirement:

1) the generalized born radius of each atom;

2) the solvation electrostatic free energy;

3) the electrostatic forces on each atom ;

4) the ph-dependent properties ;

5) the pka of all ionizable groups;

6) the electrostatic potential at the surface of the molecule;

7) the electrostatic potential in a volume surrounding the molecule.

RESULTS
generalized born radii
the born radii were computed from numerical surface integrals and the resulting self energies were compared with the reference ones obtained from the poisson-boltzmann equation for  <dig> atoms randomly chosen in the test set of  <dig> proteins. born radii and poisson-boltzmann self-energies have been computed using the solvent accessible surface as dielectric boundary or the molecular surface computed using the program msms  <cit> . the surface points density used for msms computations was  <dig> pts Å- <dig>  table  <dig> reports the results concerning the self-energies obtained using different ways to estimate the generalized born radii. it is seen that the gbr <dig> model performs very well and that the gain in accuracy when linear combinations of a constant term and self-energies corresponding to radii αn are used, with n ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> , is limited.

comparison of self-energies computed using generalized born radii from surface integrals and using the poisson-boltzmann equation. for each computational model  the average root mean square difference  ) and the correlation coefficient are reported.

for best performance it is necessary to use a number of probe points per atom larger than  <dig>  for less dense surface points occasional negative sign integrals are observed which need an adhoc treatment, e.g. resetting the generalized born radius to a predetermined value. although negative radii are not found for higher densities of surface points, there are still rarely occurring large deviations between gb and pb self-energies, which could be due to differences in the computation of the boundary surface and its further treatment in the two approaches. as an illustration of the accuracy obtained, figure  <dig> reports the plot of generalized born self-energies versus those computed using apbs.

electrostatic solvation free energy
the electrostatic solvation energy computed using the solvent accessible surface integral  at each atom, computed as half of the product charge times reaction field, was compared with the corresponding solvation energy computed using the poisson-boltzmann equation. compared to the solvation self-energy, the solvation energy depends also on other charges in the molecule and provides a test for the solvation effects computed according to equation  <dig>  the average root mean square deviation from reference poisson-boltzmann calculations is just  <dig>  kj/mol and the correlation coefficient is  <dig> . the accuracy of the gb model versus the poisson-boltzmann model may be judged from figure  <dig> which reports the solvation energy  at each atom for the  <dig> atoms of the  <dig> protein set.

electrostatic solvation forces
since solvation energies depend, according to equation  <dig>  on atomic positions explicitly and implicitly through born radii, the computation of solvation electrostatic forces is quite complex, and strongly dependent on the interface model chosen  <cit>  .

in order to estimate how important are effects due to the dependence of born radii on atomic positions, solvation electrostatic forces have been computed for each atom of the  <dig> proteins as the derivative of the solvation energy under the approximation that born radii are constant. albeit approximate this way of computing electrostatic forces preserve by definition zero total electrostatic force as expected for isotropic media and as found by the correct expression for the force  <cit> . due to the different way of computing forces we did not attempt comparing ionic boundary, dielectric boundary and charge times electrostatic field components of the electrostatic force, but we rather compared the total solvation force. the results are not very accurate with the average root mean square deviation, with respect to the forces computed using apbs using the same parameters, equal to  <dig>  kj/ compared to an average square root value of the force of  <dig>  kj/. the correlation coefficient is  <dig> .

the full computation of electrostatic solvation forces using surface integrals is described in the methods section. as a demonstration of the accuracy of the calculation  <dig> random point charges ranging between - <dig>  and  <dig>  q have been embedded in a sphere of radius  <dig>  Å at a distance of at least  <dig>  Å from each other. besides small differences due to treatment of the boundary, the agreement between force components computed using surface integrals and those computed solving the poisson-boltzmann equation is very good, with a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and a fitting slope of  <dig>  . work is under way to implement force calculation in an efficient way for large systems like proteins.

ph-dependent properties  with respect to the experimental data.

comparison of predicted vs. experimental pka's. the rmsd is reported together with the correlation coefficient. we report the results obtained using propka v. <dig> . the latter program is very accurate, but occasional large shifts, not filtered nor treated ad-hoc here, result in large rmsd and smaller correlation coefficients.

on the other hand some scaling of contributions is done and therefore large deviations from experimental results are not found. in this respect, propka that uses ten adjustable parameters and other parameters chosen for best performance  <cit>  apparently does not prevent very large shifts to be predicted. as a consequence the global rmsd from experimental data is large and could thus easily be reduced. the execution time of propka is in the range of seconds, while our program runs in minutes. no optimization or approximation has been implemented as yet.

the results are somewhat better than those obtained by propka , although the figures reported here for the performance of propka  are worse than those reported in the original papers, because of a different test set. we remark that the comparison reported in table  <dig> is dominated by outliers, that could be easily filtered or treated in an ad hoc manner, for propka. similar figures are found in independent tests  <cit> . an additional problem is that the data set includes multimeric  proteins and therefore the latter contribute more than others to the figures reported in table  <dig>  it should be noted that this comparison is far from exhaustive as many other features could be chosen to judge a method's value. extensive comparisons have been performed by stanton and houk  <cit> . the purpose of the comparison performed here is to demonstrate that our program outputs results comparable  than the results obtained by one of the best state-of-the-art method. in order to better judge the performance of the method, computed versus experimental shifts in pka values, with respect to the reference model ones, are reported in figure  <dig> 

surface electrostatic potential
the evaluation of the potential in regions outside the molecule is beyond the scope of the generalized born approach which focuses instead on self and interaction energies. this is at variance with approaches that approximate the potential computed using the poisson-boltzmann equation. in particular onufriev and coworkers  <cit>  have found an approximation  based on kirkwood's series expansion of the solution for a sphere  <cit> . their analytical model performs surprisingly well for a large set of proteins and enables fast calculation of the potential at the surface and in the volume surrounding the molecule.

the surface potential has been computed here, within the framework of generalized born approach, as the energy of interaction of all atoms of the molecule with a unit test charge with a generalized born radius equal to half the solvent probe radius, i.e.  <dig>  Å. this value was found to reproduce well the potentials computed using apbs. each surface point is assigned to the atom contacted by the solvent and for each solvent exposed atom the average surface potential is listed in the beta factor field in the output pdb file. the result is thus a readable list of atoms with the corresponding average surface potential if the atom is solvent exposed. this information may be used to display the potential using softwares like vmd  <cit> . as an example the potential computed using the poisson-boltzmann equation and using the method described above is shown in figure  <dig> for the paired domain of the protein pax <dig> and its cognate dna. exactly the same parameters are used in the two calculation with the only difference that the surface in the poisson-boltzmann calculation is generated using van der waals radii inflated by  <dig>  Å. the boundary surfaces are however different in the two calculations and this value was found to compensate for the differences.

for the same reason a point by point comparison of the potential at the surface is not completely appropriate, because boundaries are slightly different in the two calculations. instead of taking the average surface atomic potential, we compared the potential computed using the generalized born model and a  <dig>  Å radius test charge at each surface point with the poisson-boltzmann potential computed by uhbd at the same point. such comparison is reported in figure  <dig> and, notwithstanding the differences in methodologies, the correlation coefficient is  <dig>  and the average error is just + <dig>  kcal/. the root mean square deviation is  <dig>  kcal/ with the largest contributions to this figure due to outliers by several standard deviations. outliers are found in inner cavities, but also at concavities at the exposed surface. in some cases the errors are due to the differences in boundary definition. the error distribution is however similar to that reported by onufriev and coworkers  <cit> .

electrostatic potential in a volume surrounding the molecule
similar to the surface potential the electrostatic potential for a unit test charge with generalized born radius equal to half of the solvent probe radius may be computed at nodes of a grid enclosing the molecule and output in the dx format  readable by programs like vmd  <cit> . the grid is chosen based on as the minimum box entailing the molecule plus three debye length on each side. if the debye length is more than  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å are added at the minimum box on each side. the space is then divided in  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> grid points and the potential is computed at each point. the method is thus slower compared to solving the finite difference equation for the potential. at variance with standard options with other software, here the potential inside the molecule is set to  <dig>  which removes isopotential curves inside the molecules  and helps with the visualization of the structure of the molecule together with outer isopotential curves. example input files are given in the supplementary material. the comparison with the analogous analysis using the program apbs shows less smooth isopotential surfaces , a fact which might be due to the finite radius of the unit charge test particle. note that the output potential is in kj/ compared to widely used kt/ or kcal/.

CONCLUSIONS
a program for the analysis of the electrostatic properties of proteins based on the surface integral computation of generalized born radii has been presented. further work will be devoted to improve the efficiency of calculations in particular for what concerns electrostatic solvation forces. the program, together with examples is given as supplementary material .
