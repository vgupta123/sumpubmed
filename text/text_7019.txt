BACKGROUND
two major classes of methods are currently in use to detect natural selection: population methods, based on analyzing the nature and frequency of allele diversity within a species, and codon analysis methods, based on comparing patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in protein coding sequences. a substantial private and public effort has been undertaken to characterize snps tightly associated with genetic diversity. snps are identified in ests, thus polymorphism could be directly used to map functional and expressed genes  <cit> . the majority of snps in coding regions  are single-base substitutions, which may or may not result in amino acid changes. however, some snps may alter a functionally important amino acid residue, and these are of interest for their potential links with phenotypes  <cit> . if the phenotypic effect impacts survival and reproduction, natural selection operates on snp alleles  <cit> . evolutionary pressures of various kinds have often been hypothesized to cause active and rapid evolutionary changes. positive selection is a form of natural selection that influences the process by which new advantageous genetic variants sweep across populations. though advantageous mutations are of great interest, they are difficult to detect and analyze because neutral and deleterious mutations predominate by frequency. in contrast, purifying selection is expected to act against mutations that have deleterious effects on protein structure by causing changes to functionally important amino acid residues or by altering the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . since snps are almost always bi-allelic, relatively low-gene diversity at a given snp site is equivalent to lower allelic frequency than the less frequent of the two alleles. the reduction of gene diversity at these snp sites, in comparison to snps in the same genes that do not affect protein structure, provides evidence that the purifying selection has reduced the population allelic frequencies of deleterious snp alleles  <cit> . a classic measure for selective pressure on protein-coding genes is the dn/ds  ratio. the ratio of the observed non-synonymous mutation rate to the synonymous mutation rate can be utilized as an estimate of selective pressure, where dn/ds <  <dig> suggests that most amino acid substitutions have been eliminated by the purifying selection, while a dn/ds >  <dig> indicates positive selection  <cit> .

wild emmer wheat  presumably adaptively diversified from northeastern israel and syria into the near east fertile crescent, where it harbors rich genetic diversity and resources  <cit> . previous studies in cereals have shown significant nonrandom adaptive molecular genetic differentiation at single and multi-locus structures among micro-ecological environments  <cit> . the genetic differentiation of variable wild emmer wheat populations included regional and local patterns with sharp genetic differentiation over short distances  <cit> .

alpha-amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for the control of seed weevils as these insects are highly dependent on starch as an energy source  <cit> . in vitro and in vivo trials using α-amylase inhibitors, including those made in field conditions, have now fully confirmed their potential for increasing yields by controlling insect populations  <cit> . in cereal seeds, α-amylase inhibitor proteins with 120- <dig> amino acids, which include trypsin inhibitors as well as α-amylase inhibitors, can be grouped into one large family on the basis of the homology between their amino acid sequences  <cit> . it is known that the bulk of wheat albumins consists of a few amylase isoinhibitor families that are very likely phylogenetically related and coded by a small number of parental genes  <cit> . the monomeric, homo-dimeric, and hetero-tetrameric α-amylase inhibitors  are the main members of a family of wheat kernel proteinaceous inhibitors that are active on exogenous alpha-amylases of various origins. wmai- <dig> , wmai- <dig> , wdai- <dig> , and wdai- <dig>  were extensively investigated  <cit> . wmai is a proteinaceous inhibitor with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda; wdai is a  <dig> kda protein formed by the combination of two  <dig> kda subunits; wtai is a mixture  of wtai-cm <dig> plus  <dig> wtai-cm <dig> plus wtai-cm <dig>  where none of the subunits is active on its own  <cit> . it was well established that each family was closely related, with largely identical amino acid sequences and conformational structures, and it was suggested that the inhibitors derived from common ancestral genes  <cit> . in a co-evolving system of plant-insect interactions, plants synthesize a variety of toxic proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous molecules for their protection against insects  <cit> . proteinase inhibitors are therefore a potential model system in which to study basic evolutionary processes, such as functional diversification  <cit> . the structure and diversity of wdai genes in wild emmer wheat from israel was revealed, and the relationship between the emmer wheat genes and ecological factors was elucidated by  <dig> specific snp markers  <cit> . it was found that the populations of wild emmer wheat showed a wide range of diversity in wdai, both between and within populations.

in this study, snp diversity of the wheat monomeric α-amylase inhibitor formed  <dig> natural wild emmer wheat populations in israel and golan. a population analysis including an examination of its ecological characteristics as well as comparing patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in coding sequences of all accessions were also used to detect the natural selection of genes. the results yielded further insight into the correlation between plant defense proteinaceous inhibitors and their environmental stresses.

RESULTS
characterization of monomeric α-amylase inhibitors
genomic pcr amplifications were conducted by specific wmai cloning primers, and desired pcr products were detected in accessions of wild emmer wheat. a total of  <dig> novel gene sequences of wmai were obtained and submitted to ncbi , consisting of  <dig> bp including a  <dig> bp signal peptide coding domain. the frequency of snps was  <dig> out of  <dig>  bases in which  <dig> csnps were detected in the coding sequence. some population-specific snps were detected, such as 96g, which was found only in six sequences from the population of daliyya . all of the  <dig> sequences from the population of amirim  were 114g, 228c, 246g, 282c, 288g, 297a, 315a, 339a, and 438g while sequences from other populations had snps in these sites .

snps responsible for amino acid substitution are in bold.

thirty-three haplotypes were revealed by the sequence alignment of monomeric α-amylase inhibitor sequences from wild emmer wheat . haplotypes were highly separated by median-joining network analysis, and at least three groups emerged . for each haplogroup, there was a primary haplotype , while haplotype h <dig> was the main one occurring in  <dig> wmai sequences, followed by haplotype h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  the mutations  between haplotypes and the primary haplotype in each group were less than five . our findings indicate that the three haplogroups were not equally distributed . besides the haplotypes having only one sequence, some haplotypes were characterized geographically. fifteen sequences belonging to h <dig> were from the qazrin , gamla , rosh-pinna , mt. gilboa , and amirim  populations, which were located in northern sites of israel and golan.

it was found that the snps in α-amylase inhibitor gene sequences could determine amino acid substitution in proteins . only nine snps in the nucleotide sequence of wmai resulted in amino acid variations; among these snps, two were at the third codon position, and, as expected, most snps that resulted in amino acid changes were found at the first or second position . amino acid sequence alignments indicated that alpha-amylase inhibitors were highly homologous and belonged to a monomeric α-amylase inhibitor family including wmai- <dig>  and wmai- <dig>  ; however, some haplotypes shared the same deduced protein sequence. the amino acid substitutions probably determined a charge difference resulting in different relative mobility on gel electrophoresis and in differential inhibitory activities of wmai- <dig> , wmai- <dig> , wmai- <dig> , wmai- <dig> , and wmai- <dig>  with similar molecular weights  <cit> . additionally, ten cys were observed in most of the deduced proteins of the monomeric α-amylase inhibitors, and all cereal-type α-amylase inhibitors had ten cys as well. only seven sequences belonging to haplotypes h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> had arg <dig> in place of cys <dig> . interestingly, these seven sequences were all from middle israeli populations: mt. gilboa , beit-oren , and bat-shelomo , respectively.

adaptive evolution analysis
the dn/ds ratio is widely used as an indicator of natural selection in gene sequences. an excess of non-synonymous mutations relative to synonymous mutations is a clear indication of positive selection, whereas a lack of non-synonymous mutations relative to synonymous polymorphisms suggests negative or purifying selection imposed by functional constraint. to analyze the natural selection of wild emmer wheat monomeric α-amylase inhibitors, the dn/ds codon analysis for purifying and positive selection was calculated.

at first, the software pal2nal was used to calculate the dn/ds ratio for each haplotype compared with the main haplotype, which was used as a reference . the site-specific models implemented in codeml indicated that both purifying and positive selection had occurred; however, the purifying selection predominated. since the main haplotype was used instead of the original sequence, other methods should be applied to clarify the selection of this protein.

next, the selection z-test was carried out using mega  <dig> . to determine whether natural selection contributes to diversity in wmai, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions was evaluated for each pair of haplotypes. the tajima's neutrality test showed that ps  =  <dig> , pi  =  <dig> , and d =  <dig> . the z-test results revealed a very high proportion of sequences that were under selection across populations; nine haplotype sequences showed the ratio of dn/ds expected under the hypothesis of selection . these nine sequences represent cases where a haplotype differed from the other  <dig> haplotypes by more than 70%. the results of purifying and positive selection hypothesis also showed that the sequences of wmai were contributed by both selection hypotheses in this protein .

finally, we assessed positive selection with the fel routines by hyphy  <cit> . the sequence alignments and nj tree were used to calculate the dn/ds  ratio for each site . the results from hyphy analyses confirm the occurrence of selection in wmai sequences . according to the site-by-site lrt data, it was indicated that the majority of selected amino acid residues were subjected to purifying selection. the ratio values of whole sequences were also substantially lower than  <dig>  indicating that the inhibitors were under strong purifying selection pressure. however, few amino acid residues at the c-terminal were positively selected, suggesting that this part of the protein was subjected to directional or diversifying selection.

genetic diversity and distance of α-amylase inhibitor genes
the proportion of polymorphic loci p , the expected heterozygosity he, and shannon's information index i of the  <dig> populations of wild emmer wheat were summarized in table  <dig>  it was obvious that some populations had higher diversities. the values of he ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with the population of beit-oren  having the highest value , followed by the population of nahef . the population from kokhav hashahar  had the lowest he value of  <dig> . genetic distances  were calculated for comparisons of all populations based on the gene sequences of monomeric amylase inhibitors among all population pairs . however, low d values  were observed between some populations from different areas, and the estimates of d values were significantly and geographically independent. large genetic distances and sharp genetic differentiation over long geographic distances could be found.

p, polymorphic per population; he, expected heterozygosity ; i, shannon's information index

*for instance, populations  <dig> and  <dig> were collected from two sites that were  <dig> km away from each other, while populations  <dig> and  <dig> had only  <dig> km distance. the geographic distances of the first group were  <dig> times further than the second, but the genetic distance was only 1/ <dig> 

multiple regression and spearman rank correlations between environmental variables and snps
principle components analysis  was carried out using the ecological factors as variables . the main ecological factors were selected for multiple regression analysis, which was mentioned in our previous paper  <cit> . multiple regression analysis was done next using the ecological factors to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and snps. the geography, temperature, water, and solar radiation factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the diversity in the snps . the best variable predictors of he and i were two temperature factors: tdd and trd. the combination of geographic, temperature, and water availability factors were significant  for genetic diversity . snps in this gene could be classified into several categories associated with water, temperature, and geographic factors, respectively. the best single-variable predictors of snp allele frequencies were:  water ;  temperature ;  geographic  factors . it was obvious that water and temperature factors were the best variable predictors, singly or in combination, with other ecological factors .

genetic polymorphism of α-amylase inhibition sequences
the present study analyzed the extent of genetic polymorphisms and the effect of diversifying selection on snps in wild emmer wheat monomeric α-amylase inhibitor sequences among specific israeli and golan heights' populations. this is the first time large numbers of emmer wheat accessions were sequenced for functional protein genes and natural selection is depicted on a modeled structure. although snp markers had already been used to assay the polymorphism of dimeric inhibitors, only 20% of snp sites were successfully analyzed by the markers  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> wmai gene sequences from  <dig> populations that belonged to  <dig> haplotypes, and  <dig> snps were detected .

different amino acid residues determined by polymorphic sites would significantly affect the structure, charge, and function of the inhibitors. the charge difference could be responsible for the relative mobility of gel electrophoresis and the differential inhibitory activities of α-amylase inhibitors  <cit> . in former investigations, more than five inhibitor proteins belonging to the wmai family had been found, such as inhibitor  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . they had similar molecular weights but different inhibiting activity  <cit> . the relationship between nucleotide polymorphisms and the amino acid changes in wmai were summarized in table  <dig>  only  <dig> snps in the nucleotide sequence of wmai resulted in amino acid variations. most polymorphic sites did not occur at the functional conservative site, which ensures the α-amylase inhibitors maintain their ability to combine with α-amylase. all cereal-type α-amylase inhibitors had  <dig> cys . both wmai  <dig>  and  <dig> , similar to wdai  <dig> , were readily inactivated by treatments that break disulphide bonds, thus indicating that their stability mainly depends on the integrity of their disulphide bridges  <cit> . by combining fab-ms and automatic sequencing, it was possible to assign the five disulfide bonds of the α-amylase inhibitor  <dig>  from wheat kernels as follows: cys7-cys <dig>  cys21-cys <dig>  cys29-cys <dig>  cys43-cys <dig>  and cys56-cysl <dig>  <cit> . the monomeric α-amylase inhibitors from israeli and golan heights' populations had  <dig> cys , and the positions of the  <dig> cys were conserved. most of the snps did not occur at highly conserved positions, which ensured that the α-amylase inhibitors would keep their correct 3d structure to combine with α-amylase.

the mutants obtained by garcía-maroto et al.  allow the identification of two regions of the molecule that are critical for inhibition mechanisms: the n-terminal sequence  before the first cys  and the sequence after the seventh cys, which is right after a crc  motif  <cit> . according to the alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of emmer wheat wmai, no amino acids were changed by nucleotide mutations in this domain . the majority of changes in amino acids occurred at the c-terminal, and most of the amino acids in the middle domain were conserved, ensuring the stability of wmai .

although the most important positions were conserved, position analysis of the ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions provided strong evidence for natural selection acting on wmai. the dn significantly differed from ds according to pal2nal results. however, the whole sequences dn/ds <  <dig> suggested that the inhibitors were under strong purifying selection pressure  and that amino acids at the c-terminal were positively selected; in other words, amino acid-altering substitutions offer fitness advantages that would result in the diversity of wmai.

ecological genetics and evolution of wmai
experimental populations evolving under natural selection represent an interesting tool to study genetic bases of adaptation  <cit> . the ecological genetic analysis was carried out to investigate the evolutionary mechanism of wmai from wild emmer wheat. the diversity of wmai gene sequences from israeli and golan heights' populations was revealed. populations could be divided by snps, even within closely related populations originating in approximate geographic locations. our results demonstrated that the polymorphism of monomeric α-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat was correlated with the ecogeographic distribution of the accessions. observations were consistent with previous results on other seed storage proteins such as hmw-gs and wdai according to molecular markers  <cit> .

central populations used in this study were collected in warm, semi-humid environments on the golan plateau and near the sea of galilee. marginal steppic populations were collected across a wide geographic area on the northern, eastern, and southern borders of wild emmer distribution involving hot, cold, and xeric peripheries; while marginally mesic , populations were collected from the western border of wild emmer distribution  <cit> . the present study included  <dig> populations from different sites in israel and golan, and covered a wide range of ecogeographical conditions across the distribution range of the species. specific snp positions detected in wmai were found highly effective in distinguishing genotypes and populations of wild emmer wheat originating from diverse ecogeographic sites in israel and golan. high levels of polymorphic loci , expected heterozygosity , and shannon's information index  with high genetic distance values between populations were found . these results suggest that genetic variation at these snp positions in the wmai was at least partly ecologically determined for these populations.

the relationship between snp genetic distance and geographical distance was investigated, and it was found that the estimates of genetic distance  were geographically independent. sharp genetic divergence  over very short geographic distances against small genetic divergence  between large distances were observed, which was also found by allozymes, rapd loci, ssr, and snp marker analysis  <cit> . for example, the genetic distance between populations of tabigha and amirim  was  <dig> times higher than the genetic distance between populations qazrin and bat-shelomo  .

collection areas of wild emmer were different in altitude, longitude, latitude, and several other environmental factors   <cit> . it was noteworthy that snps in wmai were correlated with ecological factors by multiple regressions and the spearman rank correlations' matrix. among the  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps led to amino acid changes at nine positions . it was shown that these snps were significantly more correlated with water availability factors , temperature factors , and geographical factors  than the other factors . ecogeography, temperature, and water availability factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the diversity in snps of α-amylase inhibitor genes. diversity could be further explained by changes in ecological factors, i.e., al , the sharp gradient of climatic conditions from north to south in israel and golan, with increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability towards the semiarid zones in southern israel. also, ecological factors taken into account for this study were not representative of all the possible components involved in the determination of the actual climate  <cit> .

environmental stress can greatly influence plant susceptibility to herbivores and pathogens, and drought stress can promote outbreaks of fungal diseases and plant-eating insects  <cit> . herbivore insects and the level of herbivore pressure may vary with ecological factors. different herbivore-related selection pressures at these ecological locations may influence polymorphism of insect-resistant loci in wild emmer wheat  <cit> . different environmental pressures at each site related directly to the climate, but wmai expression responded indirectly to environmental factors. it is possible that several evolutionary mechanisms underlie the differences in diversity of α-amylase inhibitors and ecological factors. it could be concluded that the variation in genetic diversity of the wmai gene between populations is a product of selective forces.

the genetic structure of wild emmer wheat populations in israel is mosaic  <cit> . this patchy genetic distribution appears to reflect the underlying ecological heterogeneity at micro- and macro-scales  <cit> . thus, higher polymorphisms and genetic variations of wmai within and between populations could be explained as adaptive complexes generated by natural selection and co-evolution with insects.

CONCLUSIONS
alpha-amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for the control of seed weevils, as these insects are highly dependent on starch as an energy source. a total of  <dig> gene sequences of wheat monomeric α-amylase inhibitor  were obtained; the frequency of snps was  <dig> out of  <dig>  bases;  <dig> snps were detected in the coding sequence. great diversity at wmai loci, both between and within populations, was detected in the populations of israeli and golan heights' wild emmer wheat. it was revealed that wmai were naturally selected for across populations by the expected ratio of dn/ds. the results of purifying and positive selection hypothesis  showed the sequences of wmai were contributed by both natural selection and co-evolution, which ensures the conserved function as well as the inhibition of a variety of insect amylases. ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in snps. the conflict between genetic divergence and geographic distances also suggested that the snps in wmai were subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary role in gene differentiation at this locus. these results suggested that α-amylase inhibitors are adaptively selected under different environments according to population and codon analysis.
