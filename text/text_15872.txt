BACKGROUND
the p <dig> tumor suppressor gene has been implicated as a master regulator of genomic stability, cell cycle, apoptosis, and dna repair  <cit> . p <dig> is known to act as both transcriptional activator and repressor of expression of specific genes  <cit> . studies of p53-mediated repression have shown that both genes that modulate apoptotic responses and genes that promote cell cycle progression can be repressed by p <dig>  <cit> .

micrornas  are small non-coding rnas typically of 21– <dig> nucleotides in length and reported to be involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, including development, cell death, cell proliferation, hematopoiesis and nervous systems patterning  <cit> . mirnas enforce posttranscriptional silencing through the rna interference pathway  <cit> . currently more than  <dig> human mirnas have been identified and deposited in the mirbase  <cit> . computational prediction of mirna targets reveal that each human mirna can potentially target several genes  <cit> , underscoring the importance of these tiny noncoding rnas in gene regulation.

several previous studies have identified ten positive or negative feedback loops in the p <dig> pathway . all of these networks or circuits are autoregulatory in that they are either induced by p <dig> activity at the transcriptional level, transcriptionally repressed by p <dig> or are regulated by p53-induced proteins  <cit> . recently, five independent studies have shown that p <dig> upregulates mir-34a in response to dna damage leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . in light of these reports and based on the growing evidence that micrornas themselves act to either promote cancer or to stop cancer spread  <cit> , it is reasonable to conceive that the tumor suppressor p <dig> might be involved in this microrna-related network in cancer cells. in support of this, two mirnas  were found to function as oncogenes in human testicular germ cell tumors, probably by numbing the p <dig> pathway and thereby allowing tumorigenesis  <cit> . yang et al recently suggested that analysis of microrna regulation in the transcriptional network of the p <dig> gene can reveal relationships between oncogenic micrornas and p <dig>  <cit> . we therefore sought to explore if there are other micrornas that are components of the p <dig> regulatory network. in an earlier study , scanning the  <dig> human mirnas for putative p <dig> sites, we identified  <dig> mirnas that have at least one p <dig> site  and are predicted to target at least one known gene. we termed these  <dig> mirnas as p53-mirs . in the current study, apart from correlating these putative p53-mirs with the upstream regulators and downstream targets of p <dig>  we prioritize our predictions using  literature reported differentially expressed mirnas in cancer;  mirnas reported as induced or repressed following p <dig> activation  <cit> ; and  mirna targets that are functionally enriched with biological processes like apoptosis, cell cycle.

RESULTS
prediction of p53-mirs and the target genes
a significant fraction of human intergenic mirnas are reported to possess tss sites within  <dig> kb of the pre-mirna  <cit> . although it is accepted that intronic mirnas are generally transcribed along with their host genes  <cit> , tss predictions have shown them to lie predominantly in the region from - <dig> kb to - <dig> kb  <cit> . hence, we limited our search space to  <dig> kb flanking regions of the mirnas. determination of exact pri-mirna transcript lengths however is possible only through experimental work.

we used p53mh  <cit> , an algorithm that identifies p53-responsive genes in the human and mouse genome, to identify putative p53-binding site within mirnas . out of  <dig> human mirnas analyzed,  <dig> had at least one putative p <dig> site  within their flanking regions of  <dig> kb . of the  <dig> p <dig> sites,  <dig> sites were overlapping with exonic region and we did not consider these for further analysis. the  <dig> p <dig> sites  occur within  <dig> kb flanking sequences of  <dig> mirnas. we identified two p <dig> binding sites in mir-34a; however neither of these corresponds to the experimental validated p <dig> site  <cit>  in mir-34a. this is because in the current analysis we limit the mirna flanking sequence search space to  <dig> kb only while the experimentally validated p <dig> site in mir-34a occurs at approximately  <dig> kb upstream to mir-34a  <cit> .

to predict target genes of the  <dig> mirnas, we used mami server  <cit> , which has compilation of five  <cit>  target prediction algorithms. a recent study showed that about 82% of unique mirna-target pairs are predicted by only a single algorithm  <cit> . therefore, a combination of predictions from all algorithms might provide a much more comprehensive list of putative mirna-target pairs than do any single prediction. 154/ <dig> mirnas are predicted to target at least one gene while 69/ <dig> have no predicted targets. the  <dig> mirnas mapped to  <dig> mirnas. this is because some of the mirnas have more than one predicted hairpin precursor sequences. for example mir-135a has two predicted hairpin precursors . the targets are however based on mir-135a only. thus, our final set consists of  <dig> mirnas; each of which has at least one p <dig> site and is predicted to target at least one known gene. we call these  <dig> mirnas as p53-mirs. there were  <dig> genes predicted as targets of these  <dig> p53-mirs! assuming that most of these predicted targets are purely speculative , we sought to integrate multiple types of data resources and explore as to what number of p53-mirs could be targeting cancer-related genes.

micrornas associated with p <dig> upstream and downstream genes
transcriptional networks commonly contain positive- and negative-feedback loops, which provide robustness and fine-tuning to gene programs  <cit> . recent studies have suggested a possible coordinated transcriptional and mirna-mediated regulation as a recurrent motif to enhance the robustness of gene regulation in mammalian genomes  <cit> . it was also reported that mirnas predominantly target positive regulatory motifs, highly connected scaffolds and most downstream network components such as signaling transcription factors, but less frequently target negative regulatory motifs, common components of basic cellular machines and most upstream network components such as ligands  <cit> . using the p <dig> master regulatory network as a case study, we investigated the potential crosstalk between the mirnas and the p <dig> transcriptional network itself involving transcription factors upstream and downstream to p <dig>  at least four possible scenarios can be envisaged for the upstream regulators  and downstream targets  of p <dig> 

we downloaded the known upstream transcription factor  regulators and downstream target tfs of p <dig> from the p <dig> knowledgebase  <cit> . for the  <dig> upstream regulators and  <dig> downstream tfs of p <dig>  we then extracted the putative mirna regulators using mami server  <cit> , which has compilation of five target prediction algorithms  <cit> . since each of these five mirna target prediction approaches generates an unpredictable number of false positives , we intersected the results to identify the genes commonly predicted by at least two of the five algorithms  <cit>  . although it is important to confirm that a mirna is not a potential regulatory mirna of a specific gene by using different bioinformatics algorithms  <cit> , there are several experimentally validated microrna target genes that are not predicted by more than one of the current prediction algorithms. for instance the experimentally validated mir-21-pten mirna-target pair  <cit>  is not predicted by any of the five algorithms . to overcome this, we also checked the tarbase  <cit>  which has experimentally validated microrna targets irrespective of the computational predictions.

based on mami predictions, a total of  <dig> different mirnas suppress p <dig> regulators or targets. of these,  <dig>  are p53-mirs . some of the p53-mirs  are found to exclusively target p <dig> upstream activators  or repressors  or downstream activators  or repressors . interestingly, many of these mirnas have been reported as differentially expressed in various cancerous tissues or cell lines .

mirnas upstream and downstream to p53: coherent and incoherent circuits
if there is a common upstream tf that regulates both the mirna and its target gene, ideally, the transcription of the mirnas and their targets should be oppositely regulated by this common upstream tf. for example, p <dig> which is known to repress the transcription of ier <dig>  <cit>  may simultaneously activate the transcription of mir- <dig>  that may further inhibit ier <dig> posttranscriptionally. this is a coherent model for all downstream targets that are repressed by p <dig>  previous genome-scale studies have in fact shown that predicted target transcripts of several tissue-specific mirnas tend to be expressed at a lower level in tissues where the mirnas are expressed  <cit> .

alternately, a common tf  can activate a downstream target gene and also a mirna which then suppresses the downstream target gene. a well known example is the experimentally confirmed microregulatory network comprising mir-17-5p and e2f <dig> – both of which are transcriptionally activated by c-myc in human cells  <cit> . we report a similar example of mir-122a, a putative p53-mir suppressing ccng <dig>  a downstream target of p <dig>  ccng <dig> is a known transcriptional target  of the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein  <cit>  and it was recently reported that mir-122a  has an inverse correlation with cyclin g <dig> expression in primary liver carcinomas  <cit> . in other words, p <dig> activates ccng <dig> and also mir-122a which in turn suppresses ccng <dig>  this is an incoherent model. adding to this complexity further, it is also reported that ccng <dig> negatively regulates the stabilization of p <dig> in a possible negative feedback loop  <cit>  . thus, the regulatory network wherein p <dig> activates a downstream target and a mir  simultaneously appears "inefficient". however, feedforward loops have the potential to provide temporal control, because expression of the ultimate target may depend on the accumulation of adequate levels of master regulator and the secondary regulators  <cit> . therefore, if we consider a sequential gap in the activation time of the target genes and the mirna, then this downstream p53-gene and p53-mir regulation appears coherent. feedforward loops may provide a form of multistep ultrasensitivity  <cit> , as any deviation from the p53's steady state would drive the downstream targets and mirna  away from their steady states in the same direction. p53-mirs could therefore tune the production rate of the downstream p <dig> target gene opposite to the direction of p53's fluctuation. such noise buffering probably helps to maintain target protein homeostasis and ensures more uniform expression  <cit>  of the p <dig> downstream target genes within a cell population. additionally, since the level of p53-mir defines the p <dig> downstream target's translation rate, their coexpression may allow p53-mir to fine-tune the downstream target's steady state. thus, p53-mirs acting on p <dig> downstream targets could significantly shorten the response delay, leading to more effective noise buffering, as well as precise definition and maintenance of steady states.

we found two entries in tarbase   <cit>  which are relevant and could be interesting to p <dig> network  mir- <dig> targeting bcl <dig>  <cit> , an upstream repressor of p <dig>  <cit>   and  mir-106a reported to suppress rb <dig>  <cit> . a previous study has shown that mir-106a is induced more than  <dig>  fold  after p <dig> activation  <cit> . p <dig> is known to suppress rb <dig> transcription through inhibition of the basal promoter activity  <cit> . additionally, posttranscriptionally, p <dig> might suppress rb <dig> further by inducing mir-106a, a known suppressor of rb <dig> .

as a master transcriptional regulator, p <dig> is also known to trans-repress genes including those affecting signaling pathways such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and cytoskeleton organization  <cit> . although, the mechanism of repression is often unclear and may not be dependent on site-specific dna-binding activity  <cit> , the responsiveness of some genes to p <dig> can be indirect in that target genes  might be other transcription factors  <cit>  or micrornas, which then modulate downstream responses to p <dig> signaling. we, therefore, hypothesize that in case of p <dig> downstream targets, the foremost activated positive feedback in a coupled feedback circuit can rapidly induce the "on" state transition of the signaling system , and that then another delayed positive feedback  robustly maintains this "on" state. finally, the most delayed negative feedback reinstates the system in the original "off " state, preventing any further excessive response specific to the applied stimulus.

loss of p <dig> expression in some tumors has also been shown to occur through inhibition of transcription of the p <dig> gene itself  <cit> . for example, mir- <dig>  one of the p53-mirs predicted to suppress the upstream activator  of p <dig>  is reported to be upregulated in colorectal cancer  <cit> . shalgi et al recently reported that the extent of mir mediated regulation varies extensively among different genes, some of which, especially those who serve as regulators themselves, are subject to enhanced mirna-based silencing  <cit> .

p53-mir target genes – functional over-representation analysis
functional over-representation analysis was performed to objectively identify biological processes potentially affected by p53-mir target genes. specifically, the percentage of p53-mir target genes with a given gene ontology  annotation was compared with the percentage of whole mirna-target genes genome-wide with the same annotation. a significant p value  indicates that the observed percentage of p53-mir target genes with a given annotation could not likely occur by chance given the frequency of whole mirna-target genes genome-wide with the same annotation. mami predicted target genes for the  <dig> p53-mirs were  <dig>  we used david  <cit> , and our in-house developed toppgene server  <cit>  for the functional enrichment analysis. since apoptosis and growth arrest are common known consequences of p <dig> activation, we also tested whether p53-mirs tend to target apoptotic and cell proliferation related genes. interestingly, the enrichment analysis revealed that while cell cycle regulation  was among the top in the p53-mir targets functional enrichment , apoptosis was not significant. the other significantly enriched go terms include transcription, vesicle-mediated transport, intracellular signaling cascade and cellular metabolism . interestingly, vesicle-mediated transport  and endocytosis  were specifically enriched in cancer-associated p53-mir target genes. abnormal expression or mutation of endocytosis proteins has been reported in human cancers  <cit> . the possibility of harnessing the endocytic machinery to cancer through mirnas could offer viable and promising leads in cancer therapy.

we extended p53-mir target gene functional enrichment analysis further to identify specific p53-mirs that significantly target apoptotic and cell proliferation genes . there was an overlap of  <dig> p53-mirs  between these two groups. earlier studies have shown that mir- <dig> is indeed critical for cell proliferation  <cit> . a recent study also implicated mir-23a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in cardiac hypertrophy and reported that these mirnas were regulated in response to stress signaling in the heart  <cit> . the additional file  <dig> enlists the other functional categories significantly enriched within the putative p53-mir targets. it is to be noted that 18/ <dig>  apoptotic p53-mirs and 22/ <dig>  cell proliferation p53-mirs have been reported in literature as differentially regulated in various cancerous tissues or cancer cell lines .

another interesting model is sirt1-mir-34a-p53; sirt <dig> is known to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis by attenuation of the transcriptional activation potential of p <dig> primarily through deacetylation of p <dig>  <cit> . several recent studies have shown that p <dig> activates mir-34a. a speculative model  therefore is, in normal state mir-34a, a known p53-mir, suppresses sirt <dig>  balancing the sirt1-mediated transcriptional repression of p <dig>  however, during tumorigenesis, increased levels of sirt <dig> will suppress p <dig> triggering further suppression of p <dig> downstream mir-34a in a feedback loop. examples of such models may have potential implications for cancer therapy. for example, combining dna damage drugs , sirt1-mediated deacetylase inhibitors, and mir-34a activation  may have synergistic effects in cancer therapy for maximally activating p <dig> 

p53-mir and p <dig> protein interaction networks
since the functional state of a protein-protein interaction network depends on gene expression, a fundamental question is what relationships exist between protein interaction network and gene regulation  <cit> . liang and li in their recent study of evidence for global correlation between microrna repression and protein-protein interactions reported that interacting proteins tend to share more microrna target-site types than random pairs  <cit> . in the current study, using the known p53-interactants, we calculated the probability of p53-mirs regulating the p <dig> interactants. we mined the biogrid database  <cit> , and currently there are  <dig> known interactants of p <dig>  surprisingly,  <dig> of these  <dig> p53-interactants were predicted to be regulated by p53-mirs and were shown to be statistically significant  . using the known data of mirnas induced or repressed following p <dig> activation  <cit> , we further filtered the p53-mirs that could be associated with the p <dig> interactome. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the p <dig> interactome along with the putative p53-mir regulators that are shown to be induced or repressed  <cit>  respectively following the activation of p <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our bioinformatic-based analysis yielded several putative regulatory circuits that involve p <dig> and micrornas along with their target genes. although these predicted networks need to be experimentally validated to ascertain a bona fide regulatory relationship, it is still exciting to speculate that these p53-mirs may be critical to tumorigenesis through their regulation of the p <dig> master regulatory network. we strongly believe that our results substantially expand the hitherto little known repertoire of mirnas in p <dig> regulatory network. it can be anticipated that further characterization of our predicted p53-mirs and their target genes will improve our understanding of the underlying processes of cancer, tumorigenesis, and ultimately impact response to therapy.
