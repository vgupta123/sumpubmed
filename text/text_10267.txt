BACKGROUND
immune systems in vertebrates have two basic arms: innate and adaptive immunity. the innate immune system is the first line of defense protecting the host from invading pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. it consists of various types of leukocytes  that specialize in phagocytosis  and in evoking a complex response at the site of infection, collectively known as inflammation. the adaptive immunity arm is capable of specifically recognizing and selectively eliminating foreign microorganisms and molecules. it relies on t and b lymphocytes that express antigen-specific receptors. upon encountering their specific antigens, these lymphocytes undergo extensive proliferation , maturation and activation. there are multiple cross-talks between the innate and adaptive immunity arms. for example, the phagocytic cells are intimately involved in the activation of the adaptive arm by functioning as antigen presenting cells  required for the activation of t lymphocytes, and th lymphocytes secrete stimulatory cytokines that enhance phagocytosis by the specialized phagocytic cells.

innate immune responses to pathogens are triggered by recognition of prototypical pathogen components, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns , through cellular pattern recognition receptors . prominent among these pathogen sensors is the family of toll-like receptors . to date, ten and thirteen tlr genes have been cloned in human and mouse, respectively; each of the tlrs appears to recognize a unique set of pamps  <cit> . tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are expressed on the cell surface membrane and recognize bacterial and fungal products, while tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reside in intracellular endosomes and specialize in detection of pathogens' nucleic acids  <cit> . for example, lipopolysaccharide , which is a common structure of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, is recognized by the extracellular tlr <dig>  whereas double-stranded rna , which is a viral pamp, triggers the intracellular tlr <dig> signaling. the function of the other tlrs is less characterized.

after recognition of their ligands, tlrs trigger intricate cellular signaling pathways that endow the cells with antiviral and antibacterial states, which are acquired by the induction of protein effectors that impede viral replication and bacteria growth, and of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules that enhance the activation of the adaptive immune response  <cit> . the activation of this broad response is mediated by a signaling cascade that leads to stimulation of several transcription factors , primarily nf-κb, irf3/ <dig>  and ap- <dig>  important among the induced cytokines are the interferons , whose secretion results in the induction of a set of ifn-stimulated genes , which are vital components in the development of antiviral and antimicrobial cellular states  <cit> . the transactivation of the isgs is controlled via the jak/stat signaling pathway either by an ifnα/β-activated tf complex termed isgf <dig> , which binds to a regulatory element denoted as isre   <cit> , or by an ifnγ-activated stat <dig> homodimer complex, which binds primarily to the gas regulatory element  <cit> .

the transcriptional program spanned by activated tlrs encompasses hundreds of genes. the advent of gene expression microarrays and the availability of complete sequences of the mouse and human genomes enable study of these networks on the system level. here, we analyzed four publicly available genome-wide datasets that recorded expression profiles in mouse and human macrophages stimulated with various pathogen-mimetic agents, with the goal of obtaining global delineation of the transcriptional network activated by tlrs. combining computational analyses of gene expression profiles and cis-regulatory promoter sequences, we dissected the tlr-induced transcriptional program into two major components: the first is universally activated by all examined tlrs, and the second is specific to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  our results identify nf-κb as the key regulator of the universal tlr response and the isre element as the key control site of the tlr3/ <dig> specific component, and reveal, on a genomic scale, known and novel target genes regulated by these elements. we also identify novel putative positive and negative feedback loops in these transcriptional programs, further increasing the complexity of the known tightly regulated network induced in response to pathogen invasion. analysis of the kinetics of the induced network showed that while nf-κb regulates mainly an early-induced and sustained response, the isre element functions primarily in the induction of a delayed wave. in addition, we demonstrate that the pair of nf-κb and isre elements constitutes a cis-regulatory module that endows its targets with enhanced responsiveness to tlr3/ <dig> activation. by combining expression and promoter analyses, we substantially reduced the high level of noise inherent in genome-wide analysis of such data, and obtained highly reliable results supported by independent datasets from both human and mouse.

RESULTS
we sought to obtain a global view of the transcriptional programs that are induced by activated tlrs, and to identify components common to all tlrs and those specific to some of them. to this end, we used four large-scale gene expression datasets that examined global response in mouse and human macrophages stimulated with various tlr stimulators  <cit>  . our analysis flow is schematically sketched in figure  <dig> and is described in detail in the sections below. in brief, starting with the mouse datasets, we first partitioned the induced genes into disjoint groups according to the subset of stimulators to which the genes were responsive. applying computational analysis of cis-regulatory promoter elements we sought to discover the major tfs that control each of the identified response groups. next, we analyzed the kinetics of the transcriptional network induced by lps treatment, and identified the tfs that regulate each kinetic pattern. finally, we corroborated the results obtained on the mouse datasets by demonstrating their validity in independent human datasets.

characterization of tlr-induced transcriptional networks
in the first step of the analysis, we analyzed the comprehensive gene expression dataset gathered by the innate-immunity system-biology project  <cit> , in which expression profiles were recorded in two murine macrophage cellular systems  and the raw <dig>  monocyte macrophage-like cell line) at several time points after exposure to six agents, each in a separate experiment. we began with the mouse datasets because they included more stimulators and denser kinetics than the human datasets. the following are the agents examined in mouse, and the tlrs they activate: lps – tlr4; pam <dig> – tlr2:6; pam <dig> – tlr1:2; poly i:c  – tlr3; r <dig> – tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and cpg – tlr <dig> . in order to distinguish agent-specific from common responses, we divided the genes into disjoint groups according to the subset of agents in which they were induced. each group consisted of genes that were up-regulated by at least  <dig> -fold  by a particular subset of agents, and did not exceed this factor of induction by all other agents . in this analysis we included only the time points common to all probed agents:  <dig> mins,  <dig> mins,  <dig> hr,  <dig> mins and  <dig> hrs in the mmbmm dataset, and  <dig> hrs in the mmraw dataset. groups with less than  <dig> genes were ignored, as they do not contain sufficient information for further statistical analysis. obviously, in such partition some genes are classified somewhat arbitrarily, e.g., a gene whose induction level is slightly above the  <dig>  cutoff in lps and slightly below  <dig>  in all other agents, is assigned to the lps-specific group. however, the mean expression pattern of each gene group reveals a sharp difference between the average induction level in response to the agent that defines the group and the average induction level in response to all other agents , indicating that the borderline genes are a minority within the groups. we identified two induction patterns in addition to the six agent-specific sets : 1) a large core universal response –  <dig> genes that were induced by all examined stimulators; and 2) a response only to lps and pic  –  <dig> genes that were induced by lps and pic, and did not pass the  <dig> -fold threshold in the four other stimulators. remarkably, both of the above sets are substantially larger than all the other non-agent-specific groups , pointing to the major biological role of these two response components in the tlr induced network.

functional characterization utilizing the standard go ontology  <cit>  revealed that the universal and tlr3/4-specific responder sets were highly enriched for functions related to the innate immune response, including inflammation, and chemokine and cytokine activities . interestingly, no enrichment for any functional category was detected for the agent-specific sets. one explanation could be that these sets contain more false positives, as detection of genes induced only in a single condition is more prone to noise. in addition, it is possible that genes specifically induced by a single stimulator are less functionally characterized.

our next goal was to identify the regulators that underlie the induction of the tlr-mediated transcriptional programs. we and others have demonstrated that combining computational analysis of cis-regulatory promoter elements with gene expression measurements can identify major transcription factors  that regulate transcriptional networks, even in complex mammalian systems  <cit> . we applied the promoter analysis algorithm prima  <cit>  implemented in the expander package  <cit> . given a target set and a background set of genes, prima performs statistical tests to identify tfs whose binding site  signatures are significantly more prevalent in the promoters of the target set than in the background set. here, each of the eight gene sets was considered a target set and the entire set of  <dig>  genes present on both arrays used in the mmbmm and mmraw datasets served as the background set . prima identified significant over-representation of the nf-κb binding site signature in the group of genes that were induced by all tlrs , and of the isre element in the set of genes that were induced only by lps and pic  . as in the functional analysis, no over-represented promoter signals were detected for the agent-specific clusters. prima tests are confined to tfs with characterized binding site signatures. search for novel elements using the meme motif discovery tool  <cit>  did not find any additional motif, except for the ubiquitous sp <dig> signature in several sets. taken together, the analysis suggests that while nf-κb is universally activated by all tlrs, the tfs that act via the isre element  complex) are activated specifically by the tlr4- and tlr3-mediated signaling pathways. indeed, many key targets of nf-κb and the isre element are in the universal and tlr3/ <dig> sets, respectively, as shown in figure 2a. notably, in support of this model, the nf-κb <dig>  nf-κb <dig>  rel and relb subunits of nf-κb are themselves included in the universal set , while irf <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig>  which bind the isre, were specifically induced by the lps and pic treatments. 

carrying out a similar analysis on the sets of down-regulated genes  did not yield any significant results. however, taking into account the later time-points of  <dig> h and  <dig> h  identified enrichment of cell-cycle related go categories and tfs , reflecting proliferation arrest upon pathogen recognition.

kinetics of the lps-induced transcriptional response
expression profiles in response to lps stimulation were recorded at denser time points , which permitted detailed analysis of the kinetics of the transcriptional program induced by this agent. we partitioned the genes that were induced by lps  into three sets according to the kinetics of their induction, as follows: for each gene we recorded the first time at which it exceeded the  <dig> -fold induction threshold, as well as the time at which its expression was highest; we defined three kinetic patterns: 1) early induction and early peak , containing the genes that peaked  before  <dig> hrs; 2) early induction and delayed peak  – the genes that were first induced before  <dig> hrs and peaked at  <dig> hrs or later; and 3) delayed induction and delayed peak  – the genes that were first induced  at  <dig> hrs or later . in both datasets, the 'dd' set was considerably larger than the two other sets, reflecting the fact that the main transcriptional response to lps exposure was at  <dig> hrs or later.

searching for tfs that control these kinetic waves, we applied prima to these six sets . we identified over-representation of the following bs signatures in both datasets: atf/creb in the promoters of genes assigned to the 'ee' set; nf-κb in the 'ed' set; and isre in the 'dd' set . in addition, enrichment for srf bs signature was identified in the 'ee' set in mmraw, and for ets in the 'dd' set in mmbmm. these results suggest a model in which tfs of the atf/creb family modulate an immediate transcriptional response, nf-κb controls an early response that persists longer, and tfs that act via the isre element  regulate mainly the delayed transcriptional response. importantly, in accordance with this model, we observed that genes that encoded for tfs of the respective families followed a kinetic pattern that was correlated with the one manifested by their putative targets . to further corroborate this kinetic model, we carried out a complementary analysis in which we compared the induction kinetics of putative targets of nf-κb and isre based on appearance of strong tf binding site  motif hits in their promoters . comparing the induction of the putative targets of nf-κb or isre, but not both , indeed showed that targets of nf-κb were induced before targets of isre . similar statistical tests showed that genes whose promoter contained an atf/creb bs signature peaked at earlier time points than induced genes whose promoter did not contain this cis-regulatory element .

an additive effect of the pair of nf-κb and isre elements
the above results suggest that nf-κb and the irf-like tfs that act via the isre element mainly regulate separate components of the tlrs-induced program and different response waves induced by lps. yet, genome-wide scan identified  <dig> genes whose promoters contained hits for these two regulatory elements. in  <dig>  of these promoters, the isre element is located upstream to the nf-κb putative site, indicating no order bias between the two elements. we next examined whether there is an enhanced effect when nf-κb and isre elements co-occur; in other words, do genes whose promoter contains both bss exhibit a unique expression pattern? we did this by comparing the expression of these genes after exposure to lps to that of putative targets of each single element separately. targets of the nf-κb+isre pair tended to have higher expression values than genes with only one of these elements . specifically, when the putative targets of nf-κb were sorted in descending order according to their maximal expression value in mmbmm , the top 10% genes were significantly enriched for the nf-κb+isre pair . the top 10% genes with the isre element were also enriched for the pair . this finding points to an additive effect of these two regulatory elements that boosts the induction of the respective target promoters beyond the induction of genes controlled by only one of them. this suggests that the nf-κb and isre cis-elements form together a functional regulatory module in promoters of genes that are induced by lps. an alternative explanation for this observation is that the identification of targets of a single cis-element is more prone to false-positives than that of both elements, and therefore the expression values we obtained for the set of putative targets of nf-κb and isre separately were attenuated to a larger extent by false-positives than the expression of putative targets of the module. however, previous studies support the additive effect of the nf-κb+isre module, reporting several genes that were co-regulated by nf-κb and isre. doyle et al  <cit> , for example, experimentally demonstrated functional cooperation between nf-κb and irf <dig> in the induction of ifnβ and ip- <dig>  in response to lps.

corroboration of the findings on independent human macrophage datasets
the results presented hitherto were inferred from analysis of responses of mouse macrophages to various tlr stimuli. seeking corroboration of our findings in human cells, we analyzed two publicly available datasets that profiled transcriptional responses in immunologically challenged human macrophages. the first study, by nau et al.  <cit> , examined expression profiles in human monocyte-macrophages at several time points  after stimulation by various agents; among them lps and pic are common to the stimuli examined by the mouse datasets we analyzed . the second study, by jeffery et al.  <cit>  , profiled transcriptional responses in several human leukocytes challenged with various stimuli, among which monocyte-macrophages treated with lps for  <dig> hrs were relevant to our analysis . these two studies provided us with independent data that profiled the transcriptional network induced by activated human macrophages, and allowed us to examine whether our findings on the major roles of nf-κb and isre elements in the activation of the transcriptional networks induced by activated tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  are valid also in humans.

analyzing the hsm <dig> dataset, we first identified the genes that were induced by lps alone or by pic alone, or by both treatments, and subjected these three gene sets to computational promoter analysis. in full accordance with the results obtained on the mouse data, an unbiased search for tfs that underlie the networks induced by lps and pic in hsm <dig> did not identify any signal in the sets of genes that responded specifically to either lps or to pic, but did detect a significant over-representation of nf-κb and isre elements in the promoters of genes that were induced by both agents . this over-representation reflects the superposition of the two components of the tlr-induced transcriptional program: the universal response induced by all tlrs  and the tlr3/4-specific component . these findings were further supported by the second human macrophage dataset that we analyzed:  <dig> genes were induced by at least  <dig> -fold at  <dig> hrs after lps treatment in the hsm <dig> dataset. unbiased computational promoter analysis again detected only two signals enriched in this gene set: nf-κb  and isre .

next, we sought to demonstrate that the kinetic model that emerged in the analysis of the mouse datasets remains valid for the human data. following the analysis applied to the mouse datasets, we partitioned the genes induced by lps and pic in the human datasets to the three kinetic sets: 'ee', 'ed' and 'dd' , according to the kinetics of their activation, and searched for over-represented signals in the promoters of these gene sets. in agreement with the results obtained on the mouse dataset, here too we observed a strong enrichment for nf-κb and isre elements in the 'ed'  and 'dd'  sets, respectively . in contrast to the results found on the mouse dataset , we did not detect here an over-representation of atf/creb in the 'ee' set . this is probably due to the small size of this set and the existence of only a single "early" time-point , which might have hindered statistical detection of enriched signals.

last, we examined whether the additive effect between the nf-κb and isre cis-elements could be detected also in the human macrophage datasets. indeed, the same statistical test we applied to the mouse data revealed that in both hsm <dig> and hsm <dig>  the 10% most highly induced putative targets of each of the two elements were significantly enriched for genes whose promoter contained a signature for both nf-κb and isre .

the table shows the p-values of the enrichment of the module's putative targets within the top 10% targets of nf-κb/isre, based on the genes' maximum induction  in response to lps.

discussion
in this study we systematically delineated the transcriptional program induced by stimulation of various tlrs in macrophages. we dissected two major components of this program: the first is a core response universally activated by all examined tlrs, and the second is specifically activated by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  our analysis identified nf-κb and irf-like tfs binding isre as the key regulators of these two components and pointed to their respective target genes on a genomic scale. while the involvement of nf-κb and irf-like tfs in response to tlr induction has been known before, our study makes novel contributions to several aspects of system-level understanding of the transcriptional networks induced by innate immunity:  the combined, focused reanalysis of four independent datasets identifying a clean, combinatorial response;  revealing the intricate kinetics of the transcriptional response;  pinpointing novel specific genes involved in each of the responses;  identification of nf-κb and isre binding site locations over target genes; and  the refinement of the understanding of the regulatory circuitry involved in innate immune response.

novel targets of nf-κb and isre identified in this study  call for experimental validation. typically, a genome-wide scan for putative tf targets is prone to a high rate of false positives. however, the candidates we identified are based on diverse evidence that collectively increase the confidence that they are true targets: their induction was triggered by several stimulators in multiple time points and in independent studies on two organisms; and in most cases the respective bs signature was identified in both the human and mouse orthologous promoters.

promoter sequences matching the pwms of nf-κb and isre were identified by the prima software; mapping between human and mouse orthologous genes was downloaded from the ensembl web-site; sequences are shown on the coding strand; in cases of multiple matches, the sequence of the first listed match is shown; "n/f" means no putative bs was found. for each gene, the tables indicate  its maximum fold-induction  in response to lps in all four datasets, as well as its kinetic pattern . references for validated bss are given in the last column.

the repertoire of the tlr universal response includes pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , as well as co-stimulatory molecules  that promote the activation of the t-cell branch of the adaptive immunity. the universal response also contains many general stress-responsive genes  that control cell proliferation and survival. prominent among the genes specifically induced by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are the interferon -induced genes . ifn-induced genes comprise potent antiviral molecules  and are therefore expected to be induced by tlr <dig>  which is activated by virally derived dsrna. however, ifns also have an important role in linking innate and adaptive immunity by regulating the induction of genes that enhance t-cell activation and antigen-presentation capacity in response to pathogen infection , which explains their induction by bacterial stimuli such as lps  <cit> .

without any prior knowledge on tlr signaling, our computational promoter analysis revealed nf-κb as the pivotal regulator of the universal-tlr transcriptional response. this finding is in line with current biological knowledge. several molecular mechanisms through which nf-κb is activated by tlr signaling have been characterized  <cit> . the first depends on myd <dig> and is utilized by all tlrs with the exception of tlr <dig>  activated tlrs recruit myd <dig>  which then associates with members of the irak family, initiating a cascade in which traf <dig> and tak <dig>  are sequentially activated. tak <dig> in turn promotes downstream activation of the ikk complex, which leads to the activation of nf-κb by directly phosphorylating, and thereby removing the inhibitory effect of, the members of the iκb family on nf-κb . on the other hand, tlr <dig> activates nf-κb in a myd88-independent manner: the trif adaptor protein  is recruited to activated tlr <dig>  and then directly interacts with traf <dig>  which presumably leads to the activation of nf-κb using the same cascade described above for the myd88-depndent pathway  <cit>  . substantiating the universal role of nf-κb in the tlr-induced network, we observed that the nfκb <dig>  nfκb <dig>  rel and relb subunits of the nf-κb heterodimer were induced by all examined stimuli.

superimposed on the tlr universal program, we detected a robust tlr3/4-specific response, and demonstrated by promoter analysis that its key regulator is the isre element. in addition, our results indicate that this isre-mediated response is kinetically delayed compared to the nf-κb-regulated program. these findings too are corroborated by current biological knowledge. the isre cis-element is bound by members of the irf and stat tf families. several studies demonstrated the existence of two waves of activation of tfs that act via isre by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . the emerging model is that irf <dig>  which is post-translationally activated by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> via a cascade that involves the trif  and tram  adaptor proteins and their downstream kinases ikkε  and tbk <dig>  promotes an early wave of ifn-β gene induction   <cit> . once ifn-β is produced and secreted, it engages the type-i ifn receptor in both paracrine and autocrine fashion, thereby triggering the jak-stat signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of the isgf <dig> tf complex, which is comprised of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig>   <cit> . isgf <dig> induces the expression of irf <dig>  which in turn further activates the expression of type-i ifns. in this way, a positive loop is established, which ensures persistent expression of ifn-stimulated genes that enhance the antiviral and antimicrobial cellular state  <cit> . strikingly, in full compliance with this model, we observed that ifn-β and the irf <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> tfs were specifically induced by lps and pic in the datasets we analyzed .

our analysis points to novel feedback loops in the tlr-induced network, further increasing the known complexity of the regulatory circuits that modulate its induction and repression : we identified ifih <dig>  and lgp <dig> as novel putative targets regulated by the isre element. ifih <dig> is a non-tlr cytoplasmic sensor that detects actively replicating viruses  <cit> , and triggers the induction of the nf-κb and irf <dig> pathways via the activation of the adaptor protein visa   <cit> . moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that ifih <dig> detects cytoplasmic dsrna generated during viral replication , and that this sensor also binds to pic and mediates type i ifn responses to this synthetic analog of viral dsrna  <cit> . therefore, the transcriptional program induced by pic stimulation probably reflects a combined outcome of the activation of tlr3-mediated and ifih1-mediated pathways.

interestingly, the second putative isre target we identified, lgp <dig>  is a direct negative regulator of ifih <dig>  <cit> . the simultaneous activation of positive and negative regulators of the same pathway seems to be a recurrent theme in the logic of cellular signaling networks. another novel putative positive loop in the isre-regulated network is mediated by nmi, which enhances the transcriptional activity of stat- <dig>  <cit> . in the nf-κb-regulated transcriptional response, which is universally activated by all examined tlrs, we identified map3k <dig>  and ripk <dig> as novel targets that form positive feedback loops which reinforce the persistent activation of this network  <cit> , and tnip <dig> as a regulator that forms a negative feedback loop which inhibits the iκk complex, thereby contributing to the turning-off of this response  <cit> .

the kinetic analysis of the response to lps also suggests a role for the atf/creb cis-regulatory element. we identified a significant over-representation of this signature on promoters of genes whose expression peaked at very early time points . two alternative interpretations of the role played by these elements are consistent with this rapid pattern of induction: according to the first, members of the atf/creb family activate this early and very short response; the second interpretation ascribes an inhibitory effect to these elements, implying that the tf that act via them repress the expression of their target genes, and therefore the induction of these targets declines shortly after their activation. a recent study by gilchrist et al.  <cit>  demonstrating that atf <dig> negatively regulates a subset of nf-κb target genes induced by tlr <dig> supports the second interpretation. notably, the atf <dig> gene itself is included in the tlr universal response, pointing to a negative loop that regulates a sub-network of tlr-induced transcriptional program.

the computational promoter analysis ferreted out the major regulators of the two components of the tlr-induced network. this complex transcriptional network is likely regulated by additional tfs, which were not detected by promoter analysis. indeed, the tlr universal response contains several other tfs in addition to those discussed above . this could be explained by the fact that our statistical promoter analysis detects tfs with a relatively high number of direct targets, whose bss are located within the scanned promoter region and which were responsive beyond a certain threshold in the studied conditions. it is therefore expected to miss tfs that:  have a small number of directly induced targets;  bind at large distances from the transcription start site;  regulate the tlr network by interacting with other tfs rather than directly binding to the dna; or  have a very subtle  influence on the expression of their targets.

our results suggest mainly distinct programs mediated by the nf-κb and isre cis-elements. however, when the two elements co-occured in the same target promoter, we detected an additive effect that boosts the induction of the target genes. this finding further defines the nf-κb+isre pair as a functional transcriptional module, and adds several novel candidates to the list of genes reported to be controlled by it  <cit>  . importantly, ifn-β is among the genes whose promoters were empirically demonstrated to be under the regulation of the nf-κb+isre pair  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis demonstrates the power of functional genomics approaches to delineate intricate transcriptional networks in mammalian systems. microarray data are often noisy and do not distinguish between direct and secondary responses. likewise, large-scale promoter scanning for putative tf targets produces many false positives due to the short and degenerate nature of bs signatures. combining these two sources of information, and augmenting them by utilizing datasets and promoter sequences from both human and mouse, gave us an accurate, system-level delineation of the tlr-induced transcriptional program, and identified highly reliable putative direct targets of its key regulators. the findings reported in this study generalize, on a genomic scale, the current knowledge on the identity, function, kinetics and modular organization of the transcriptional regulators that mobilize the innate immune response, which is often based on studies of specific genes. such knowledge can be useful for designing ways to pharmacologically manipulate the activity of the innate immunity in pathological conditions in which either enhancement or repression of this branch of the immune system is desired.
