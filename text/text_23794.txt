BACKGROUND
the polyamines  putrescine , spermidine , and spermine  are low-molecular-weight organic cations found in a wide variety of organisms. in plants, polyamines are involved in different physiological processes, such as growth, development, and response to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

pas are oxidatively deaminated by amine oxidases , including those that are fad-dependent  and copper-containing   <cit> . paos catalyse the oxidative deamination of spm, spd and/or their acetylated derivatives at the secondary amino group  <cit> . the chemical identity of pao reaction products depends on the enzyme source and reflects the mode of substrate oxidation. thus, in monocotyledonous plants, paos catalyse the terminal catabolism of pas oxidizing the carbon at the endo-side of the n4-nitrogen of spd and spm to produce 4-aminobutanal and n--4-aminobutanal, respectively, in addition to  <dig> -diaminopropane  and h2o <dig> <cit> . in contrast, in the dicotyledonous model plant arabidopsis thaliana, paos, namely atpao <dig>  atpao <dig>  atpao <dig> and atpao <dig>  oxidize the carbon at the exo-side of the n4-nitrogen of spd and spm, giving rise to a pa back-conversion pathway, with the production of spd from spm and put from spd, in addition to 3-aminopropionaldehyde and h2o <dig> <cit> .

cuaos catalyse the oxidation of pas at the primary amino group, giving the corresponding aminoaldehydes, with concomitant production of h2o <dig> and nh <dig>  but in contrast to paos, they are unable to produce the oxidative splitting of pas by reaction with secondary and tertiary amino groups  <cit> . cuaos are homodimeric proteins, consisting of 70– <dig> kd subunits, each containing a copper ion and a  <dig> ,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone cofactor  generated by a post-translational autocatalytic modification of a tyrosine residue in the active site  <cit> . although the overall primary sequence identity of cuao from different sources is usually not high   <cit> , thirty-three amino acid residues near the catalytic site are fully conserved in most of them  <cit> .

plant aos contribute to important physiological processes, including plant growth and development, response to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and heat, and defence responses against pathogens  <cit> . these effects are mediated not only through the regulation of cellular pa levels, but mainly by the ao reaction products: aminoaldehydes, gaba  and, markedly, h2o <dig> <cit> .

cuaos and paos, abundant in the apoplast of fabaceae and gramineae, respectively, have long been considered characteristic of these two plant families, leaving pa catabolism uncovered in other plant families and underestimating their potential contribution in other cellular compartments. more recently, a number of cuaos and paos have been detected in several taxa and the occurrence of aos in intracellular compartments has been demonstrated  <cit> . indeed, a peroxisomal localization has been reported for three of the five pao isoforms present in a. thaliana , while the other two  are predicted to be cytosolic proteins  <cit> . moreover, as mentioned above, the atpaos oxidize pas through the back-conversion pathway  <cit> . questions then arise as to whether some aos, localized in the same subcellular compartment as the arabidopsis paos, are able to catalyse the terminal oxidation of pas and how pas are oxidized in the apoplast of this model plant. cuaos occur at high levels in dicots and are the most abundant soluble protein detected in the extracellular fluids of several fabaceae   <cit> . the genome of a. thaliana contains ten genes annotated as copper-binding amine oxidases, but only one  has been characterized at the protein level, and it has been predicted that atao <dig> is an extracellular protein  <cit> .

in this work, we have characterized three of the other nine genes encoding putative cuaos in arabidopsis . our results indicate that these genes encode functional cuaos with differential cellular localizations in the apoplast and peroxisomes. the expression profile of these genes in different tissues and in response to several exogenous stimuli point to a potential specification in their biological roles. finally, considering our results and previous reports, we propose a model by which pa catabolism can be accomplished in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> sequence comparison
in various plant species cuao genes consist of a multigene family  <cit> . a search of the arabidopsis genome database revealed the presence of ten genes encoding putative cuaos . we selected the three more highly expressed genes in the genevestigator database   <cit>  for further studies: at1g <dig> , at1g <dig>  and at2g <dig> . the deduced amino acid sequences of these three putative arabidopsis cuaos were aligned with other known plant cuaos . atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> showed a high level of sequence conservation relative to previously characterized plant cuaos, with a lower level observed in atcuao <dig>  in particular, the amino acid sequence of atcuao <dig> exhibited 60% similarity to atao <dig> and 64% to the cuao of pisum sativum  . the amino acid sequence similarity between atcuao <dig> and atao <dig> was 65%, and 71% between atcuao <dig> and pscuao. however, the sequence similarity of atcuao <dig> with atao <dig> and pscuao was lower, 45% and 44%, respectively. the amino acid sequence similarity between atcuao <dig> and the other two atcuaos was also low, 44% with atcuao <dig> and 43% with atcuao <dig>  while atcuao <dig>  exhibited 63% similarity with atcuao <dig>  amino acid residues shown to be important for the catalytic activity of plant cuaos are apparently conserved in the three atcuaos studied in this work . atao <dig> contains  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid residues that have been reported to be fully conserved in cuaos from different sources  <cit> , while atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> contain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of these amino acids, respectively , including the active site tyrosine , which undergoes modification to form the tpq cofactor  <cit> , four histidines, three of which correspond to copper ligands  <cit>   and the aspartic acid active site base  <cit>  .

expression of atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> in n. benthamiana and characterization of the recombinant-tap fusion protein
to ensure that atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> encode functional cuao enzymes, they were transiently expressed in n. benthamiana as fusion proteins using the plant expression vector pc-tapa  <cit> . the tap  tag, lying downstream of the atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> orfs, facilitates antibody detection and protein purification.

atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> encode 712-, 681- and 776-amino acid proteins, respectively, with calculated molecular masses of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd, while the tap has a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kd.

five days after agro-infiltration, tissues were harvested, and the soluble protein extracts were analyzed by western blot using anti-myc epitope antibodies. a single band of the expected size  was observed for each of the three fusion proteins  , which were purified by affinity chromatography using igg-sepharose beads and digestion with 3c protease for igg cleavage. in the partially purified extracts the antibodies detected bands of about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kd, which correspond to the size expected for the fusion proteins without the 2xigg binding domain of protein a: atcuao1-myc9-his <dig>  atcuao2-myc9-his <dig> and atcuao3-myc9-his <dig>  respectively . enzyme activity of each fusion protein was evaluated by the h2o <dig> production. for this, the proteins were incubated with the h2o2-sensitive amplex red reagent, peroxidase and either put, spd or spm. when any of the three proteins were incubated with put significant oxidase activity was detected , which was reduced by pre-treatment with aminoguanidine , an irreversible competitive inhibitor of amine oxidases that interacts with the tpq cofactor . the oxidase activity was also reduced by pre-treatment with the copper complexing agent 8-hydroxyquinoline , a non-competitive inhibitor of cuaos . spd was also a good substrate for the three proteins, and the enzyme activity was again inhibited by ag and 8hql . however, none of the three fusion proteins recognised spm as a substrate. these results suggest that atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> encode functional cuaos able to oxidize put and spd, but not spm, with the subsequent release of h2o <dig> 

subcellular localization of atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao3
atcuao <dig> contains at its c-terminus  the canonical skl tripeptide, involved in the protein targeting to the peroxisome matrix. in fact, the peroxisomal association of this protein has been demonstrated previously by proteome data and a subcellular targeting study of yfp fusion protein  <cit> . the subcellular localization of this protein was confirmed experimentally by transiently expressing an n-terminal fusion of atcuao <dig> to the yfp in agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaf cells . in silico protein localization prediction using psort, the only program specifically able to predict peroxisomal targeting, failed to identify any of the other nine arabidopsis cuaos as putative peroxisomal proteins. for atcuao <dig>  the suba database   <cit>  returned a wide range of possible localizations, including extracellular, plastids, endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, while for atcuao <dig> the possible localizations were: apoplast, vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria. in order to determine experimentally the subcellular localization of these two atcuao isoforms, yfp was fused in-frame to the c-terminus of atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig>  atcuao1-yfp and atcuao2-yfp were then transiently expressed by agrobacterium-mediated infiltration of n. benthamiana leaves . confocal laser microscopy analysis of the transfected cells revealed that, as observed for yfp-atcuao <dig> , the cells expressing atcuao2-yfp showed a punctuate fluorescence pattern . the peroxisomes in the cells were labeled with blue fluorescence  due to the co-expression of the peroxisomal marker cfp-skl  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> , all punctuated yellow fluorescent signals in the cells coincided with the blue fluorescence of cfp-skl, confirming that atcuao <dig> is a peroxisomal protein and strongly suggesting that atcuao <dig> is also localized in peroxisomes. cells expressing atcuao1-yfp displayed a pattern of secretion, with fluorescence mainly located in the periphery of the cells  as occurred in cells expressing spg-dsred , used as a control of protein secretion  <cit> . moreover, the yellow fluorescence of atcuao1-yfp colocalized with the red fluorescence of the secreted dsred , suggesting that atcuao <dig> is an extracellular protein.

spatial and temporal expression of three arabidopsis cuaos
to evaluate whether the different cuao transcripts were spatially regulated, expression of atcuao1- <dig> was examined by real-time rt-pcr using total rna isolated from different organs of mature arabidopsis plants . the expression of these genes was also determined in 4-, 12-, 21- and 28-day-old whole seedlings to know if there is some kind of regulation during plant development .

atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> transcripts were detected in all organs analysed. atcuao <dig> transcripts were abundant in rosette leaves, but with the highest levels found in stems and flowers. the expression of this gene increased about 3-fold in 28-day-old seedlings when compared with those 4 days old . a similar expression pattern was observed for atcuao <dig>  with transcript levels increasing during plant development and, reaching a peak in flowers of adult plants, followed by leaves and stems . in contrast, atcuao <dig> transcript levels, which were abundant in stems but low in other organs, were not observed to increase during the developmental stages .

transcriptional profile of atcuao1- <dig> in response to external stimuli
cuaos have been reported to be involved in plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses . thus, we decided to investigate the expression pattern of atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> in response to external stimuli by subjecting arabidopsis seedlings to different treatments, including wounding, flagellin  <dig> , abcisic acid , salycilic acid , methyl-jasmonate , and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  .

the highest expression of atcuao <dig> was observed after 24 h in sa-treated plants . at this time point the atcuao <dig> transcripts were also up-regulated in response to meja, flagellin and aba, although at lower degree . it is noteworthy that induction of this gene by aba was already observed at 3 h post-treatment . atcuao <dig> expression was not significantly affected by wounding and acc treatment . atcuao <dig> transcript accumulation was also induced by aba, sa, flagellin and meja, at 8 h post-treatment . at 24 h the transcript levels of this gene increased in meja-treated plants and decreased in those exposed to aba or sa, while they were similar to those detected after 8 h of flagellin treatment. atcuao <dig> transcript abundance was slightly lower 8 h after wounding but returned to basal levels after 24 h, and was not significantly affected by acc treatment . in contrast, while atcuao <dig> expression was clearly induced  in wounded and meja-treated plants at 8 h, it was not affected by any of the other applied treatments .

discussion
in arabidopsis most studies on pa oxidation have been focused on the pao-mediated back-conversion pathway, but little is known about the terminal oxidative deamination that leads to depletion of pa levels, which in most organisms is considered to be accomplished by cuaos  <cit> . in this study, we have characterized three of the ten genes encoding putative cuaos in arabidopsis , referred to as atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig>  the recombinant fusion proteins atcuao1-myc9-his <dig>  atcuao2-myc9-his <dig> and atcuao3-myc9-his <dig> are able to oxidize put and spd, but not spm, with the corresponding delivery of h2o <dig>  and this oxidation is inhibited by the cuao inhibitors ag and 8hql . these results demonstrated that the three studied genes encode functional cuaos, which oxidize put and spd. put has been described as the best substrate for most of the characterized cuaos, but these enzymes are also able to oxidize spd and spm in plants and animals  <cit>  all plant cuaos thus far characterized and the intracellular animal cuaos have a lower catalytic efficiency for spd and spm than put, while animal serum cuaos preferentially oxidize spd and spm  <cit> . thus, spm oxidation by some of the arabidopsis cuaos not yet characterized cannot be discarded.

atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> are localized in peroxisomes , thus representing the first cuaos involved in a peroxisomal catabolic pathway of pas, since any of the animal or plant cuaos characterized so far are localized in these organelles  <cit> . atcuao <dig> contains a peroxisome targeting signal  at its c-terminus  and has already been reported as a peroxisomal protein  <cit> . although in silico protein localization prediction failed to identify atcuao <dig> as a putative peroxisomal protein, the localization pattern observed using in vivo targeting analysis of cuao2-yfp fusion protein strongly suggests that it is also a peroxisomal protein . this lack of correlation between in silico predictions and in vivo targeting analysis has been observed in other peroxisomal proteins and could be attributed to an insufficient knowledge of pts variant sequences or to the action of “piggy-backing” import mechanisms that do not involve pts sequences  <cit> .

although atcuao <dig> has been identified as a peroxisomal protein, no experimental data about its function have been reported so far. the results of this work, which show that this protein, as well as atcuao <dig>  oxidizes put and spd , acquire special significance considering that none of the three atpaos localized in peroxisomes are able to oxidize pas through a terminal catabolic pathway  <cit> . consequently, the terminal oxidation of pas in these organelles would be mediated by atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig>  thus avoiding the accumulation of put, which has been described as having an inhibitory effect on the back-conversion pathway  <cit> . the oxidation of put produces 4-aminobutanal, which can be further metabolized to gaba by the action of an aldehyde dehydrogenase   <cit> . in arabidopsis this process could take place in the peroxisomes mediated by a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase  found in this organelle   <cit> , which possesses both betaine- and amino-aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, and can oxidize 4-aminobutanal  <cit>  . these results suggest the occurrence of a tight coordination between back-conversion and terminal catabolism pathways to maintain pa homeostasis. the cooperation of the two pa catabolic enzymes is known to occur in the tobacco apoplast, where paos catalyse the terminal oxidation of spd and spm  <cit>  but, to our knowledge, this is the first time that this cooperation has been reported in peroxisomes, where paos are involved in the pa inter-conversion reactions.

atcuao <dig> is annotated as an extracellular protein in the arabidopsis information resource . this localization was experimentally confirmed using in vivo targeting analysis of the yfp-cuao <dig> fusion protein . atao <dig>  the only atcuao isoform characterized hitherto, has also been predicted to be an extracellular protein  <cit> . since none of the characterized atpaos are localized in the apoplast  <cit> , our data suggest that in the arabidopsis cell wall the oxidative catabolism of pas is mediated mainly  by cuaos.

atcuao <dig>  like atpao <dig> <cit> , was up-regulated in response to aba, meja, sa and flagellin . aba-induction has also been observed in the other two genes encoding peroxisomal atpaos   <cit> , as well as in aldh10a <dig> <cit> . these data support the idea of cooperation between the two pa catabolic pathways in arabidopsis peroxisomes and suggest that pa catabolism in this organelle can be involved in the plant response to stress. in contrast to atcuao <dig>  atcuao <dig> was strongly induced by wounding and meja, but not by other stimuli . therefore, both enzymes might play different roles in defence responses, atcuao <dig> being more specifically involved in the response to mechanical damage. the involvement of cuao in wound-healing has been previously described in several plant species, such as chickpea, where cuao expression was strongly induced by wounding and jasmonic acid  <cit> , or pea, where injury induced an increase in cuao, adh and peroxidase activity levels, as well as in put, spd and gaba content  <cit> . in tobacco, both pao and cuao have been reported to participate in the wound-healing process  <cit> . on the other hand, the transcript level of atcuao <dig> increased in 28-day-old seedlings compared to those 4 days old, but this was not observed in atcuao <dig> , suggesting that the former gene could have a more relevant role in development. the expression profile of atcuao <dig>  in growing seedlings was similar to that observed for atcuao <dig>  suggesting that this gene could also be involved in plant development. it has been reported that the h2o <dig> produced by plant pa catabolism is necessary for several plant developmental processes, such as cell expansion, polar growth, gravitropism, flower development, stomata aperture and stress responses  <cit> .

atcuao <dig>  like atcuao <dig>  was up-regulated by aba, meja, flagellin and, to a higher degree, by sa , suggesting that atcuao <dig>  like the peroxisomal cuaos, could also be involved in the plant response to stress, but more studies are required to understand the role of each protein in these processes. induction of atcuao <dig> by aba has been previously observed by wimalasekera et al.  <cit> , who showed that cuao <dig> mutants present an aba-hyposensitive phenotype and impaired h2o <dig> and no production. moreover, these mutants were less sensitive to the inhibition of root growth induced by osmotic stress  <cit> , supporting the idea that atcuao <dig> is involved in plant response to abiotic stress. the contribution of apoplastic pa catabolism to stress defense responses has been described in other plant species using pao-specific inhibitors and transgenic plants  <cit> . thus, using transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing  or downregulating apoplastic pao , moschou et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that salinity induces the exodus of spd into the apoplast, where it is catabolized by pao producing h2o <dig> that induces either tolerance responses or programmed cell death, depending on the levels of intracellular pas. moreover, s-pao plants were more tolerant to specific pathogens that depend of the apoplast for their growth, like the bacteria pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete phytophora parasitica var. nicotianae. furthermore, the high pa oxidation in the apoplast of these plants preinduces responses such as the expression of sar-linked genes and increased cell wall-based defense, showing that pao is a nodal point in a specific apoplast-localized plant-pathogen interaction, at time that induces defense responses to prevent pathogen colonization  <cit> . since none of the atpaos are localized in the apoplast, it could be hypothesized that the protective roles attributed to apoplastic pao in tobacco could be mediated by cuaos in arabidopsis. further studies using knock-out mutants or cuao overexpressor lines might help to verify this hypothesis. it is worth noting that atcuao <dig> was strongly induced by sa, while atcuao <dig> expression increased markedly in response to meja . sa and jasmonic acid induce resistance to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, respectively  <cit> . thus, the different response of atcuao <dig> and atcuao <dig> to these compounds, together with the different localization of the corresponding proteins , suggest a divergent evolution of cuao family members leading to specificities in the response to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. indeed, in tobacco leaf apoplast, pa oxidation has been reported to have a beneficial effect in defence against biotrophic pathogens, while the opposite was observed for necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> .

overall, our results support that pa catabolism in arabidopsis occurs in different cellular compartments mediated by different aos . in the apoplast, put and spd are oxidized through a terminal process mediated by cuaos , while in peroxisomes this pathway  is co-localized with the pao-mediated back-conversion. in the cytosol, atpao <dig>  and probably atpao <dig>  catalyse the pa inter-conversion reactions  <cit> . some of the putative atcuaos are annotated as cytosolic by tair, but no experimental data about their function and cell localization are available. thus, the possibility of co-localization of both pa catabolic pathways in the cytosol cannot be discarded.

CONCLUSIONS
three arabidopsis cuaos involved in the terminal catabolism of put and spd, two major pas present in plants, have been characterized. our results indicate the occurrence of a differential localization of these cuaos in the apoplast and peroxisomes, together with a possible functional specification of cuaos against different types of stress. importantly, our results support that back-conversion and terminal pa catabolism are co-localized in peroxisomes of arabidopsis, thus suggesting that pa homeostasis is maintained by a tight coordination between both catabolic enzyme machineries . we propose a plausible and integrative model by which pa catabolism can be accomplished in arabidopsis .
