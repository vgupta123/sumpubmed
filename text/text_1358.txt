BACKGROUND
insulin-like growth factor  <dig> is an anabolic hormone produced in the liver that is known to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of many cell types and plays an important role in tissue renewal and repair  <cit> . growth hormone binds to specific receptors on the hepatocyte cell membrane and triggers a mechanism , that synthesizes and releases igf- <dig> into the blood  <cit> . the normal levels of igf- <dig> are between 120– <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . because of important igf- <dig> functions in the body, people who suffer igf- <dig> deficiency also experience many harmful side effects  <cit> . patients with liver cirrhosis have a reduction of the gh receptor in the hepatocytes and the diminished synthesis of the liver parenchyma causes a significant decrease of igf-i levels in the blood . this reduction in igf- <dig> results in systemic problems including muscle atrophy, osteopenia, hypogonadism, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight loss, and many others  <cit> . studies in rats with liver cirrhosis showed that treatments with low doses of igf-i help to induce significant improvements in intestinal absorption  <cit> , hypogonadism  <cit> , and liver functions  <cit> . replacement therapy with igf- <dig> in liver cirrhosis patients requires daily doses of  <dig>  to  <dig> mg. thus, a single patient would need to consume about  <dig> mg igf-1per year. however, igf- <dig> treatment is very expensive. in addition to the applications described above, igf- <dig> is used in treatment of dwarfism  <cit> , diabetes  <cit>  and osteoporosis  <cit> .

currently, most of the igf- <dig> that is available is synthesized in e. coli  <cit>  or yeast  <cit> . construction and maintenance of fermentation systems are very expensive. in addition, formation of inclusion bodies in e. coli or variable biological activities of different forms of igf- <dig> in yeast are disadvantages of current production systems. transgenic plants are good expression systems for large-scale production of recombinant proteins at industrial levels. plant systems have many advantages including the low cost of growing plants on a large scale, the availability of natural protein storage organs, and the established practices for their efficient harvesting, transporting, storing, and processing  <cit> . it has been estimated that the cost of producing recombinant proteins in plants could be  <dig> to  <dig> fold lower than producing the same protein by e. coli via fermentation  <cit> .

however one major drawback of expression of human blood proteins via the nuclear genome is their low levels of expression, mostly less than 1% of the total soluble protein. some examples of these proteins are human serum albumin  <dig> %, haemoglobin  <dig> %, and erythropoietin  <dig> % of total soluble protein  <cit> . also, a synthetic gene coding for the human epidermal growth factor was expressed only up to  <dig> % of total soluble protein in transgenic tobacco  <cit> . igf- <dig> expression level in transgenic rice and tobacco was in the range of 22– <dig> ng/mg protein or  <dig>  –  <dig> % total soluble proteín, after optimization of codons for plant expression and use of optimal regulatory sequences with or without leader peptides  <cit> . although improvements have been made recently for enhancing expression of foreign genes  <cit> , most progress has been made in expression of vaccine antigens  <cit>  and monoclonal antibodies  <cit>  using plant viral technology. however, there are not many examples of high level expression of human blood proteins using nuclear transgenic plants. the most commonly encountered challenges are random integration of transgenes into the nuclear genome leading to position effect and transgene silencing, resulting in low levels of foreign gene expression. the position effect could be eliminated by site specific integration of transgenes into the chloroplast genome  <cit> . no gene silencing has been ever reported in transgenic chloroplasts. in spite of expression of transgenes up to 46% of the leaf protein  <cit>  or 150– <dig> fold higher transcription than the nuclear transgene  <cit> , no gene silencing has been observed in transgenic chloroplasts. yet another major advantage of transgene expression via the chloroplast genome is their containment because of maternal inheritance of chloroplast genome  <cit> . containment of foreign genes via pollen or seeds is achieved by their expression only in leaves or vegetative tissues and their harvest before emergence of reproductive structures.

based on these advantages, several vaccine antigens and biopharmaceuticals have been expressed in chloroplasts and their efficacy has been evaluated. for example vaccine antigens have been expressed against bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens and have been shown to be immunogenic and offer protection against pathogen challenge  <cit> . similarly, several human blood proteins including somatotropin  <cit> , interferon alpha  <cit> , interferon gamma  <cit>  and insulin  <cit> , were expressed in chloroplasts and shown to be properly folded and fully functional. however, no detailed study has yet been reported on evaluation of the structure of human blood proteins or their amino acid sequence or codon usage. therefore in this article, we investigate optimization of codon composition of the human igf- <dig> and compare expression of the native and synthetic genes at different stages of growth and development of transgenic lines under normal or continuous illumination. after purification of chloroplast derived igf- <dig> using igg sepharose affinity column chromatography, 2-d, electrophoresis and mass spectrometer analyses were used to investigate structural identity. cell proliferation assay was used to evaluate biological activity of chloroplast derived igf- <dig> 

RESULTS
chloroplast vectors with native and synthetic igf- <dig> genes
analysis of the codon composition of igf- <dig> gene revealed a less than optimal at content of 41% for chloroplast expression. the most highly translated protein in the chloroplast is encoded by the psba gene; therefore codon composition of this gene served as a model for igf- <dig> optimization . after optimization of the igf- <dig> gene, the at content was increased from 41% to 60%. one goal of this study was to compare expression levels of the native igf- <dig>  gene to the optimized, synthetic igf- <dig>  gene. to test the expression levels of igf-1n and igf-1s, tobacco plants were transformed with the chloroplast transformation vector  containing either the igf-1s or igf-1n gene. the pld vector contains the homologous recombination sequences trni and trna, that allowed site specific integration into the chloroplast genome as described previously  <cit> . both the native and synthetic genes contain the psba promoter and 5' utr, which enhances translation under illumination. the psba 5' utr is a cis acting regulatory element, controlling the translation of genes in higher plants. in addition, both constructs contain a 3' utr, shown to increase the stability of the transcript  <cit> . the integration of either igf- <dig> gene cassette into the inverted repeat region should double the transgene copy number.

the igf- <dig> gene was fused to the zz tag to facilitate the purification process. creating this fusion increases the protein's stability and protects the polypeptide from proteolytic degradation. the pldg-igf-1n and pldg-igf-1s vectors were designed with the glu-asn-leu-tyr-phe-gln-gly amino acid sequence, which is recognized by the tobacco etch virus  protease and cuts between the gln-gly. in this way, the igf- <dig> polypeptide can be released without any extra amino acids.

igf- <dig> expression in e. coli using chloroplast vectors
the chloroplast expression system utilizes many prokaryotic features including transcription and translation. therefore, western blot analysis was used to detect igf- <dig> expression in e. coli. when the two plasmids, igf-1s and igf-1n were tested in e. coli, expression of the protein was detected only in clones with the synthetic gene  and not in the native human igf- <dig>  therefore this observation confirms that an optimized gene enhances translation in a prokaryotic system .

confirmation of site-specific transgene integration
tobacco leaves were bombarded with the pldg-igf-1s and pldg-igf-1n vectors. after  <dig> hours of incubation in the dark, the bombarded leaves were cut into small pieces  and placed in rmop medium with spectinomycin selection . this high concentration of spectinomycin helped to eliminate untransformed cells and cells in which the gene cassette integrated into the nuclear genome . after four weeks of growth on the selection medium, the putative transgenic green shoots appeared from bleached leaves. the 3p and 3m primer pair that land in the native chloroplast genome and in the aada gene, respectively, confirmed integration of the gene cassette into the chloroplast genome . transformed plants that have the gene cassette integrated into the chloroplast genome showed a  <dig>  kb pcr product . plants that grew in the selection medium but did not show transgene integration in the chloroplast genome are most likely mutants, with mutations in the 16s rrna gene. transgenic shoots that show the  <dig>  kb pcr product have the gene cassette integrated into the chloroplast genome. those shoots that produced the correct size pcr product were cut into small pieces and transferred into fresh rmop medium with spectinomycin for a second round of selection. after transgenic shoots were obtained from the second round of selection, they were tested with the 5p-2m primers to confirm the integration of the aada and igf- <dig> genes into the tobacco chloroplast genome. the positive transgenic shoots produced a  <dig>  kb pcr product .

evaluation of homoplasmy
the potted plants were tested by southern blot analysis to evaluate if transgenic lines were homoplasmic or heteroplasmic. the flanking sequence probes allowed us to identify if all the chloroplast genomes are transformed  or if both the transformed and untransformed chloroplast genomes were present . this probe contained portion of the trni and the trna genes and therefore, the probe hybridized with the trni and trna genes that are in the chloroplast genome . the transgenic and untransformed plant dna were digested with bgl ii restriction endonuclease, which produced two dna fragments  in transgenic plants and one fragment of  <dig>  kb in untransformed plants. the t <dig> transgenic plants containing the igf-1s and the igf-1n showed only the two fragments of the transgenic chloroplast , confirming that these plants had achieved homoplasmy . the t <dig> igf-1s plants were also homoplasmic . a second probe  was used to confirm the integration of the igf- <dig> gene into the chloroplast genome of these transgenic lines . all of the transgenic lines showed the  <dig> bp fragment produced by the bgl ii digestion confirming that the igf- <dig> gene was integrated into the chloroplast genome. untransformed plants did not show this fragment in the southern blots.

evaluation of chloroplast transcripts
the potted plants were grown in a photoperiod of  <dig> hours of light and  <dig> hours of dark at 27°c. rna was extracted from transformed and untransformed tobacco plants to perform northern blot analysis. transcripts of about  <dig> nucleotides were observed in the transgenic lines, which contains the psba promoter, 5' utr, the igf- <dig> gene, and psba 3' utr. this mrna is considered monocistronic and it is the most abundant transcript in all transgenic lines . in addition, dicistronic and polycistronic transcripts were observed in lower abundance in the chloroplast transgenic lines. northern blot analysis also showed that the igf-1s and the igf-1n transgenic lines had similar transcript abundance and there were no significant differences at the transcriptional level between the igf-1n and igf-1s genes. also, unusual transcripts were not observed in the native gene, confirming the lack of non-specific processing of transcripts.

igf- <dig> expression in transgenic chloroplasts
western blots made using protein extracts from plants grown in a photoperiod of  <dig> hours of light and  <dig> hours of dark showed that the plants transformed with igf-1s and igf-1n genes were expressing the igf- <dig> polypeptide, which had a molecular weight of  <dig> kda . autoradiographs were used to quantify the amount of igf- <dig> expressed in the different transgenic lines using alpha imager and alphaease fc software  by comparison with known quantities of igf- <dig> standard. the igf-1n plants had an expression level of  <dig> % igf- <dig> in the total soluble protein . the igf-1s plants  had a  <dig> % tsp and the t <dig> plant  had a  <dig> % tsp. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  were performed in the same transgenic lines to further confirm protein quantification. elisas showed that igf-1n transgenic lines had an expression level of  <dig> % tsp. the igf-1s transgenic lines  had  <dig> % tsp and the t <dig> transgenic lines had  <dig> % tsp . thus, expression levels were confirmed by both methods.

the transgenic tobacco lines were exposed to continuous light for  <dig> days to evaluate igf- <dig> expression levels, because the psba promoter and 5' utr are regulated by light. elisas showed more than  <dig> fold increase in the expression levels after the transgenic lines were exposed for  <dig> days of continuous light . the igf-1s transgenic line  had an igf- <dig> expression level of  <dig> % tsp and t <dig> transgenic line had  <dig> % tsp, because these were younger plants. the igf-1n-plant  had an expression level of  <dig> % tsp. the expression levels were measured again after  <dig> and  <dig> days. for both igf-1s and igf-1n, the elisas showed a decrease in the expression levels , although the decrease was more significant in igf-1n transgenic lines. additionally, igf- <dig> protein accumulation was measured in young, mature, and senescing leaves. a young leaf was taken from the top five leaves, the mature leaf was green and fully-grown from the mid-section of the plant, and the old leaf was senescent and from the very bottom of the plant. figure 7c shows that all transgenic lines had a higher igf- <dig> expression in mature leaves. younger leaf cells contained fewer chloroplasts and the psba was developmentally regulated; therefore, expression levels were less than mature leaves. older senescent leaves had lower accumulation of igf- <dig> probably due to higher proteolytic activity. another experiment was performed to quantify igf- <dig> expression during plant development by comparing seedlings and plants after  <dig> days and  <dig> days of growth in pots. the transgenic tobacco line showed an igf- <dig> expression level of  <dig> % tsp in the seedling,  <dig> % tsp after  <dig> days in the pot and  <dig> % tsp after  <dig> days in the pot , confirming developmental regulation of the psba promoter. elisa experiments showed that the expression levels between the t <dig> and the t <dig> transgenic lines were very similar . quantitation of igf- <dig> in different fraction showed that it was present in both the total and soluble fractions , suggesting that some of the igf- <dig> is in the insoluble fraction.

purification and characterization of igf- <dig> expressed in chloroplasts
human insulin like growth factor  linked to the s. aureus z tag was isolated by igg sepharose affinity column chromatography and examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purity . partial removal of the staphylococcus aureus z domains from chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> was obtained following hydroxylamine cleavage of the s. aureus z domain – igf- <dig> fusion protein . immunoblot analysis using human anti-igf- <dig> as the primary antibody identified the two bands as containing igf- <dig> .

to confirm igf- <dig> structure by mass spectrometry, 2d focusing/phoresis was performed on the chloroplast synthesized igf- <dig> protein. four protein spots were detected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda after staining with commassie blue . the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda spots were digested with trypsin and evaluated for the presence of igf- <dig> peptides by ms/ms mass spectrometry using a thermo lcq deca xp mass spectrometer fitted with a nanospray rp column . evaluation of the spectra was accomplished with x-tandem software matching against the fasta databases for s. aureus and h. sapiens. the fasta databases provide in simple single letter format, the primary protein sequences contained in the explored sample . in figure  <dig>  the top panel is the pure ms without fragmentation. the second panel shows all of the significant ms/ms events derived from the ms scans. the third panel shows the ms/ms events that yielded a fragment with m/z  <dig> +/-  <dig> mu. these were all grouped together in one cluster eluting at  <dig> . the elution time of  <dig>  shows a single charge mass of  <dig>  and a double charge mass of  <dig>   <dig>  the x-tandem software identified s. aureus protein a in all the spots examined . sequest software  permitted identification of the active portion of igf-1b and identified  <dig> tryptic peptides yielding dozen ions ranging from m/z  <dig> to  <dig> . the heaviest spot on the 2d gel  gave an igf- <dig> signal on three peptides from this spot. of particular significance were signals generated by peptide 70– <dig>  and peptide 105– <dig> . signals for these peptides were also found in the second heaviest  <dig> kda band . thus, in at least two of the spots analyzed from the 2d gel separation of the igg sepharose column eluate, it was possible to identify both human igf- <dig> and the s. aureus z tag domain .

the biological activity of partially purified human igf- <dig> preparations isolated from tobacco chloroplasts was established by measurement of igf- <dig> stimulation of mammalian cell proliferation. briefly, human megakaryoblastic  cells carrying the igf- <dig> receptor were cultured in rpmi- <dig> medium. at the beginning of the time course assay, commercial human igf- <dig> , or igf- <dig> partially purified from tobacco chloroplasts was added to each well at several different concentrations. the cell cultures were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hours and a portion of each culture was stained with trypan blue dye to quantify cell viability prior to cell proliferation measurements as reliably determined by hemocytometer cell counting methods. murine 3t <dig> fibroblasts carrying the igf- <dig> receptor were maintained in dmem medium and were evaluated in different concentrations of igf- <dig> by the cyquant nf cell proliferation assay  and by hemocytometer counting methods. cell proliferation was measured by fluorescence measurements of dna replication based on intercalation of a fluorescent dye™ into double stranded dna. while increased numbers of mouse 3t <dig> cells were detected as compared to the uninoculated control, this increase was significantly less than the increase in human hu- <dig> cell numbers stimulated by plant synthesized igf- <dig> . red, blue and green lines represent the best fit of the respective data points for each proliferation assay . at the beginning of the time course assay, commercial human igf- <dig> with purity > <dig>  or partially purified chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> or ts buffer  was added to cells in  <dig> wells at different concentrations. the error bars represent growth differences among these wells of the tissue culture plate. chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> was tested starting from dilution 1: <dig>  which corresponded to  <dig>  ng/ml igf- <dig>  addition of chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> resulted in a dose-dependent growth response at low concentrations. the effective range was in dilutions at 1:  <dig> – 1:  <dig>  <dig>  which corresponded to  <dig> - <dig> ng/ml igf- <dig>  worthy of note, is the observation that the maximal level of the cell proliferation was seen with commercial igf- <dig>  almost at similar concentrations.

chloroplast-derived igf- <dig>  at higher concentrations  did not significantly stimulate the proliferation of the hu- <dig> cells; this could be due to some impurity present in these preparations that were obtained with rapid purification. however, >97% pure commercial igf- <dig> also did not show dose dependent increase between  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig>  ng/ml concentrations. these results suggest that both the commercial and plant synthesized igf- <dig> have similar levels of mitogenic activity and that the apparent dip in the dose response curve at higher igf-1concentrations may be due to currently unknown environmental factors that had an approximately equal effect on the two sources of igf- <dig>  therefore, addition of chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> resulted in a dose-dependent growth response of hu- <dig> cells, very similar to commercial igf- <dig>  alterations in the mitogenic response to decreasing igf- <dig> dosage are similar in both chloroplast-derived igf and commercial igf inoculated cell cultures. these observations argue against specific differences between chloroplast-derived and commercial igf- <dig>  chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> functioned efficiently in spite of the presence of zz-tag and possibly other impurities present after rapid purification.

discussion
transplastomic lines express significant amounts of human igf- <dig>  the difference in igf- <dig> expression levels is insignificant between the synthetic and native genes in the chloroplasts. this may be due to optimal levels of expression already achieved with the native gene and limitations of the chloroplast protein synthetic machinery other than codon usage. on the contrary, the igf- <dig> polypeptide was only expressed in the e.coli cells that contain the igf-1s. these results show that e. coli translational machinery may be different from chloroplast in codon preference and usage. although previous studies used chloroplast vectors for expression of foreign proteins in e. coli, this is the first time a dramatic difference has been observed between these two systems in their translation machinery.

the psba promoter and 5'utr were used in the pldg-igf-1n and pldg-igf-1s vectors to enhance the protein expression. the expression levels increased more than  <dig> fold after five days in continuous light. also, igf- <dig> expression levels increased during plant development. both light regulation and developmental regulation of the psba gene is well known in the literature although this study has further confirmed the role of such regulatory elements using a human blood protein. this information will be useful in various biotechnology applications. similarly, igf- <dig> expression was measured in young, mature and old leaves. the igf- <dig> expression was higher in mature leaves and this again provides an ideal time to harvest this protein in the green house or field.

maternal inheritance of genetically modified chloroplast genomes and the absence of any reproductive structures when foreign proteins are expressed in leaves, offer efficient transgene containment and facilitates their safe production in the field  <cit> . two recent studies point out efficient control of maternal inheritance of transgenes in transplastomic tobacco. ruf et al  <cit>  set up a stringent selection system for paternal transmission by using male sterile maternal parents and transplastomic pollen donors conferring plastid specific antibiotic resistance and green fluorescence for visual screening. this selection system identified six among  <dig>  million seedlings screened  that showed paternal transmission of transgenes and the authors concluded that plastid transformation provides an effective tool to increase biosafety of gm crops. svab and maliga  <cit>  examined the contribution of alien cytoplasm to rare paternal plastid transmission and reached similar conclusions. transplastomic plants producing human therapeutic proteins have been already tested in the field after obtaining usda-aphis approval  <cit> . because of such unique advantages, transgenic chloroplasts have been used for expression of human therapeutic proteins  <cit> .

igg-sepharose affinity column chromatographic separation of z domain containing chloroplast derived igf- <dig> protein confirmed a protein with a molecular mass corresponding to human igf- <dig>  staphylococcal protein a  is an immunoglobulin-binding receptor present on the surface of the gram positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus. the strong and specific interaction between spa and the constant part  of certain immunoglobulins  have made it useful for purification and detection of immunoglobulins in a variety of different applications  <cit>  and therefore in our study the zz tag was used for purification of igf- <dig> fusion proteíns expressed in chloroplasts. spa does not contain any cysteine residues that could interfere with the disulfide formation within a fused target protein  <cit> . the hydroxylamine cleavage resulted in approximately 40% cleavage of the zz tagged igf- <dig> to igf- <dig> + zztag-igf- <dig> as observed by acrylamide gel staining following gel electrophoresis. hydroxylamine cleavage was more efficient than tev protease and less expensive but resulted in full length igf- <dig> with no extra amino acids. there is evidence that dependent upon the fusion protein, the zz tag can be more or less resistant to hydroxylamine cleavage. this may be responsible for the reduced level of zz-tag cleavage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of human igf- <dig> in purified plant extracts was confirmed by single and two dimensional electrophoresis methods and the structural elements of chloroplast-derived igf- <dig> was further confirmed by mass spectrometer analysis. cell proliferation assays confirmed the biological activity of chloroplast derived igf- <dig> and found that human hu- <dig> cells react strongly to the addition of chloroplast generated igf- <dig> even in the presence of the s. aureus z tag. proper functionality of igf- <dig> suggests that required disulfide bonds are formed. presence of disulfide bonds in several chloroplast-derived human blood proteins including interferon alpha, gamma and somatotropin  <cit>  was evaluated by their functionality in cell culture assays. therefore, therapeutic proteins expressed in transgenic chloroplasts have proper post-translational modifications and are fully functional. while purification of chloroplast generated human igf- <dig> to homogeneity remains to be attained, retention of significant biological activity of the zz tagged igf- <dig> molecule indicates its effective biological usefulness even in an altered state. therefore, the ability to use plant chloroplasts as bioreactors to generate proteins of great economic value that retain their essential biological activity is an exciting goal that appears to be within our grasp.
