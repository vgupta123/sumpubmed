BACKGROUND
the development of synthetic insecticides and parasiticides has revolutionised the control of arthropod pests and parasites of agricultural, medical and veterinary importance. however, the overuse of chemical control agents tends to promote the development of heritable insecticide or drug resistance  <cit> , with life-cycle traits of targeted organisms often favouring the ability to adapt genetically, such as high reproductive potential and short generation span. drug resistance can follow from pre-existing mutations in resistance genes, termed resistance alleles, which under normal conditions are rare and have a negative or neutral effect on fitness but which, under conditions of exposure to control agents, afford fitness benefits and can become enriched in the target species’ gene pool given persisting selection pressure from the control agent  <cit> . by the time resistance becomes apparent as treatment failure, resistance alleles have usually already reached high frequencies in the gene pool  <cit> .

caligid copepods, also called sea lice, are common ectoparasites of marine fish  <cit> . one species, the salmon louse ), has emerged as a serious problem in mariculture of atlantic salmon  in the northern hemisphere. the annual cost of sea louse infection to the global salmon farming industry has been estimated at € <dig> million, with the majority of this accounted for through expenses accrued from treatments with veterinary medicines  <cit> . only a limited range of anti-sea louse drugs are available and licensed for the treatment of fish, and the continued use of a relatively small number of compounds creates a situation potentially favouring the development of drug resistance  <cit> . in the salmon louse, losses of efficacy have been reported for a number of control agents including organophosphates  <cit> , pyrethroids  <cit> , hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  and avermectins   <cit> .

the commonly used anti-sea louse treatment slice®  contains the avermectin compound emamectin benzoate  . slice® is administered orally and a one-week treatment provides prolonged protection against all host-attached life stages of sea lice  <cit> . avermectins are also used against external and internal parasites of humans and livestock, including parasitic nematodes causing the human diseases onchocerciasis  and lymphatic filariasis, as well as gastrointestinal parasites of sheep, cows and horses  <cit> . the selective toxicity of avermectins against ecdysozoan invertebrates is believed to be based on the binding and blockage of glutamate-gated  and γ-aminobutyric acid -gated  chloride channels in the invertebrate nervous system  <cit> . several molecular mechanisms have been suggested as contributing factors to the resistance of parasitic nematodes to the avm compound ivermectin   <cit> . functional studies revealed that resistant nematodes can have single amino acid mutations in subunits of glucl and gaba-cl that decrease the channels’ sensitivities to the drug  <cit> . furthermore, resistant nematodes may show increased expression of abc  transporters, a group of membrane proteins with members capable of mediating the cellular efflux of drugs  <cit> . finally, avermectin resistance in insects has been connected to alterations in drug metabolism  <cit> .

previous studies on potential molecular mechanisms of emb resistance in salmon lice have used the candidate gene approach, i.e. the study of genes that have previously been linked to drug resistance in other organisms. in particular, such studies have investigated salmon louse abc transporters  <cit>  and gaba-cl and glucl subunits  <cit> . however, potential outcomes resulting from such candidate approaches are limited by the current knowledge of the biological process being studied. to avoid this limitation, a transcriptomic approach was followed in the present study, in which microarray analysis was used to compare mrna responses between drug susceptible and moderately  emb resistant laboratory strains of salmon lice.

RESULTS
experimental design
two laboratory-maintained strains of salmon lice were used in the present study. strain s is susceptible to all currently licensed anti-sea louse treatments including emb, while strain pt is moderately resistant to emb   <cit> . adult male salmon lice were used for the transcriptomic analyses as they are considered to provide a more steady physiological state than adult females, which undergo considerable morphological change following fertilisation and which are subject to repeated cycles of egg production. salmon lice were collected from host fish anaesthetised in 100 mg l- <dig> 2-phenoxyethanol and were then allowed to recover in aerated seawater for 2 hours before use.

in experiment  <dig>  rna expression profiles were analysed in lice sampled directly after recovery in order to reveal differences in constitutive gene expression between strains. experiment  <dig> investigated the effects of short-term  exposure to 200 μg l- <dig> of emb, compared to seawater and carrier controls . this concentration of emb resulted in >95% immotility of s lice after 24 hours, but had no observable effects on pt lice . we hypothesised that, should the tolerances of pt lice to emb require transcriptional regulation, this should become apparent in transcriptomic profiles during the early stages  of exposure. in addition to being investigated for effects of emb, the data from experiment  <dig> were also analysed with respect to differences in constitutive transcript expression between strains. for this purpose, data for the one and three hour sea water controls from experiment  <dig> were pooled for each strain in order to obtain the same level of replication as used in experiment  <dig> . control data from experiment  <dig> were pooled between  <dig> and 3 hour time points as we had previously observed that exposure of salmon lice to seawater for up to 12 hours after collection from the host has no effect on responses to emb in water-borne bioassays .

custom microarray design
for transcriptomic analyses, custom agilent 15 k feature 60mer oligonucleotide microarrays were designed using sequences derived from salmon louse suppression subtractive hybridisation  libraries created in the present study together with expressed sequence tags  publicly available in genbank. although the microarrays differed in a minor way between experiments  <dig> and  <dig> due to continuous elaboration/modification, the features included on the microarrays employed largely overlap . to obtain a pool of salmon louse cdna sequences enriched for transcripts differentially expressed between the emb-resistant  and drug-susceptible  salmon louse strains, two ssh libraries were constructed, corresponding to subtractions between strains in both directions. a pool of both libraries was subjected to roche  <dig> sequencing, producing a total of  <dig>  reads . the assembly of contiguous sequences  from sequence reads provided  <dig>  annotated  and  <dig> un-annotated target sequences. kegg functional analysis of the annotated sequences revealed a large representation  of genes involved in metabolism . in addition,  <dig>  l. salmonis ests  were obtained from genbank and assembled into contigs, providing a further  <dig>  annotated  and  <dig>  un-annotated target sequences for the design of oligo probes to be used in the microarray designs .

* oligo probes were designed to both the forward and reverse complement sequence for all targets that were not suitably annotated but included on the custom microarrays.

analysis of strain differences in constitutive gene expression
to determine constitutive differences in gene expression between the pt and s strains, mrna expression profiles were analysed in adult male salmon lice sampled in february  <dig>  and may  <dig> . when data from each experiment were analysed including only features present on both microarrays, similar numbers of features were found to be differentially expressed between strains in experiment  <dig> and experiment  <dig> . comparison of these two feature lists revealed that only  <dig> features were reported as being significantly differentially expressed between strains in both experiments. of these,  <dig>  showed the same direction of strain differences in the two experiments  and represented  <dig> genes of which 57% were annotated. these  <dig> genes were arranged by significance of the expression differences determined in experiment  <dig> 

genes that were represented in the top  <dig> most significantly differentially expressed transcripts are detailed in table  <dig>  which includes a substantial number of cytoskeleton proteins  and proteases . enrichment analysis of the  <dig> features resulting from comparison of expression between strains was performed with respect to the gene ontology  annotation representation on the microarray. nine go attributes were found to be significantly over-represented , with calcium ion binding, structural constituent of muscle and actin binding being shown to be the most significantly over-represented go terms.

annotated genes  were sorted by the significance of differential expression between strains in experiment  <dig> and arranged by biological function. features with identical annotation were removed prior to categorising biological function. also indicated is the percentage representation for each functional category in the total number of annotated genes .

to confirm findings from microarray analyses, transcript abundance was analysed for a sub-set of significantly differentially expressed genes using rt-qpcr. genes were selected on the basis of potential significance as pharmacological targets of emb , or detoxification mechanisms . maltase-glucoamylase was further included because of its high level of differential expression  between salmon louse strains. rt-qpcr analysis found that transcripts of nachr α- <dig> were ~ <dig> -fold and ~ <dig> -fold less abundant in the pt than the s strain in experiments  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, which confirmed trends observed in the microarray analyses . similarly, rt-qpcr demonstrated that pt lice showed significantly lower levels of gaba-cl α-subunit mrna expression compared to the s strain , although differences were marginal. isoforms of cytochrome p <dig> and carboxylesterase, i.e. enzymes potentially involved in detoxification, were found to show higher mrna expression levels in the pt compared to the s strain in experiment  <dig>  but not experiment  <dig>  transcript levels of maltase-glucoamylase were much lower in pt than s lice in experiment  <dig>  whereas in experiment  <dig> the mrna expression was moderately increased in pt compared to s lice .

for selected genes, mrna expression was measured in salmon lice from two strains differing in emb susceptibility , results compared to findings obtained in microarray analyses. significance  assessed by t-test  for microarray analysis and one-way anova for rt-qpcr analysis. fold changes ≥  <dig>  are underlined.

effects of short-term exposure to emb on transcript profiles in salmon lice
three-way anova of the microarray expression data from experiment  <dig> showed that a large proportion  of the total number of features that passed quality filtering  was affected by the factor strain. in contrast, the factor treatment had a comparatively small influence on gene expression . to confirm these microarray results, transcript abundances were determined by rt-qpcr for six selected genes. genes were selected so as to include a number of qualitatively different expression profiles, detectable fold-changes and selected candidate genes  . a high degree of correlation was observed between expression values measured by both methods  of  <dig>  to  <dig> ; p < <dig> ).

significance  assessed by three-way anova. also indicated is the percentage of the total number of features  used in the analysis.

to further investigate the effects of emb exposure, a list of those features that were significantly affected by emb treatment or for which significant interactions between treatment and other factors were observed  was compiled. this list comprised a total of  <dig>  features, of which at least 35% were involved in metabolism . transcript abundance profiles for the  <dig>  features were further subjected to network clustering using the biolayout express3d application  <cit> . this resulted in the resolution of  <dig> clusters with a minimum cluster size of four features. the two main clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> features, respectively, that showed fold changes >  <dig>  across all conditions . within the two clusters, expression profiles were characterised by pronounced responses in s lice following 1 h of emb exposure , and a full or partial return to basal expression levels after 3 h of emb exposure. moreover, for genes in both clusters, few if any responses to emb exposure were observed in the pt strain.

the most significantly differentially regulated genes from cluster  <dig>  and the responses to emb exposure in both salmon louse strains are summarised in additional file  <dig>  an analogous selection of genes from cluster  <dig> is provided in additional file  <dig>  genes in cluster one include the gaba-cl and nachr α- <dig> subunits which are potential targets for emb, with nachr α- <dig> also having been identified as constitutively differentially expressed between salmon louse strains. genes in cluster two included a glutathione-s-transferase isoform and a nachr α- <dig> precursor. enrichment analysis of the features in cluster one is detailed in additional file  <dig>  showing significant over representation of twelve and under representation of four go attributes. chitin binding, calcium ion binding and hydrolase activity were the most significantly over-represented attributes and nucleic acid binding was identified as the most significant under represented attribute.

discussion
using transcriptional profiling in comparative studies of a drug-susceptible and an emb-resistant salmon louse strain, this study demonstrated the reduced constitutive mrna expression of subunits of certain ligand-gated ion channels  in the emb resistant strain, namely a gaba-gated chloride channel subunit  and a neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit . the toxicity of emb and other avms against ecdysozoan invertebrates is reported to be based mainly on their interaction with another class of lgics, the glutamate-gated chloride channels   <cit>  although gaba-cls are also believed to be pharmacological targets of avms  <cit> . while nachrs are traditionally not considered to be implicated in the toxic action of avms in ecdysozoans, they can be allosterically modulated by ivm  <cit> . this study’s finding that mrna levels of gaba-cl and nachr subunits are decreased in emb-resistant salmon lice suggests that these lgics may represent potentially additional target sites for avms in sea lice. when transcriptomic profiles of emb-resistant and -susceptible laboratory salmon louse strains were investigated in response to short term  aqueous emb exposure, a number of transcriptional responses to the treatment were observed in the drug-susceptible s lice, but few responses were found in the emb-resistant pt strain. while we cannot exclude the possibility that emb exposure might provoke more pronounced transcriptomic responses in pt lice at later time points, differential toxicity of emb between the louse strains is apparent as early as 5 hours post-exposure . this suggests that the mechanism of resistance, whether constitutive, responsive or a combination of both, must have occurred before this time point. the present study only considered levels of mrna. molecular mechanisms underlying differential susceptibilities between the studied strains could also include post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as mrna processing and degradation, translation and protein degradation  <cit> , however, these lay outside the scope of the present study.

avms are used against parasitic and pest species of ecdysozoan invertebrates including nematodes, insects and mites, and more recently against crustaceans. while the molecular target sites of avms in crustaceans are unknown, glucls are generally considered to be the main pharmacological targets of ivms in nematodes and insects  <cit> . the glucls form an invertebrate-specific subgroup of the large ‘cys-loop’ subfamily of lgic. ‘cys-loop’ lgics have a pentameric structure, and are composed of either the same type of subunits or two to three different subunit isoforms. consistent with the role of glucl as the main target of avms, ivm-resistant strains of invertebrates can show mutations changing the expression levels or the peptide sequence of channel subunits  <cit> . a gluclα subunit has been cloned in l. salmonis <cit>  and while gluclα was represented amongst the microarray targets used for this study, no difference in mrna expression was observed between salmon lice of the two studied strains, or amongst those subjected to control and sublethal emb treatments .

apart from glucl, further lgics are known to interact with avms. for instance, ivm modulates the activity of nematode gaba-cl  <cit> , and can exert directly activating or potentiating effects on vertebrate glycine-gated chloride channels  <cit> . moreover, avms can modulate the activity of cation-lgics such as the α- <dig> nachr  <cit>  and the atp-gated p2x <dig> receptors  <cit> . a number of observations involving drug-resistant insects and nematodes support the hypothesis that lgics other than glucl constitute further toxicologically relevant targets of avms in invertebrates. cyclodiene-resistant fruit flies having a single amino acid mutation in a gaba-cl showed a moderate degree of cross-resistance to ivm  <cit> . a null mutation in a histamine-gated chloride channel also conferred moderate ivm resistance in drosophila melanogaster meigen,  <dig>  <cit> , and a novel dopamine-gated ion channel  was significantly down-regulated in an avm-selected strain of the nematode haemonchus contortus   <cit> . the observation in this study that emb-resistant salmon lice show decreased mrna levels of nachr and gaba-cl is consistent with findings in the literature cited above, and suggests a role for nachr and gaba-cl as additional pharmacological targets of emb in salmon lice. it is worth noting in this context that observed changes in nachr expression could also relate to previous exposure of pt lice to compounds interfering with cholinergic neurotransmission such as the organophosphate  anti-sea louse drug azamethiphos  <cit> . however, decreases in nachr expression are not among typical molecular responses associated with op resistance in insects  <cit> . while decreased expression of nachr has been observed in nematodes resistant to imidazothiazoles and other drugs that directly target nachr channels  <cit> , these are classes of compound that have not been used against sea lice.

apart from modifications of the molecular targets, biocide resistance in pests and parasites can result from increased elimination of the chemical as a result of up-regulation of biotransformation enzymes and/or drug transporters. the superfamily of cytochrome p450s  contains heme-thiolate proteins that function as monooxygenases, many of which are involved in drug metabolism  <cit> . cyps play important roles as chemical resistance genes in insects  <cit> , but their roles in the biochemical defence against toxicants in crustaceans are less well understood. the microarrays used in the present study included probes representing a number of target sequences that are annotated as cyps . these partial l. salmonis cyp sequences could not be unequivocally attributed to specific cyp families, as this would require establishing the overall degree of amino acid similarity to cyp family members  <cit> . however, based on blastx annotation , most of these sequences could be provisionally allocated to cyp clans, which are higher-order groupings that combine phylogenetically related cyp families  <cit>  . two targets showing similarity to cyp15a <dig> and cyp18a <dig>  differed in mrna expression in l. salmonis from experiment  <dig>  but not experiment  <dig>  moreover, compared to the emb susceptible strain a target showing similarity to cyp3a <dig>  had lower expression levels in the emb resistant strain, with a moderate  difference in transcript abundance found between the strains. in insects, cyp15a <dig> is involved in juvenile hormone synthesis  <cit> , whereas cyp18a <dig> functions to inactivate ecdysteroids  <cit> . crustaceans possess homologues to both these clan  <dig> cyps  <cit> , but little is known of their function. in the green shore crab  expression levels of two cyps from clan  <dig> were affected by both the moulting cycle and previous exposure to xenobiotics  <cit> . the differences in cyp mrna levels found in this study were relatively small and/or variable between experiments and therefore do not provide clear evidence for an involvement of cyps in the differential emb susceptibility found in the salmon louse strains that were studied.

carboxylesterases are another class of enzymes that can confer insecticide resistance  <cit> . in this study, the expression of one carboxylesterase was moderately enhanced in emb-resistant salmon lice in experiment  <dig>  but no significant differences in expression were observed between strains in experiment  <dig>  accordingly, the data provides no evidence for a role of carboxylesterase in emb resistance of salmon lice.

abc  proteins are a family of membrane-bound transporters mediating the transport of a diverse array of substrates across biological membranes  <cit> . certain abc proteins are drug efflux transporters located in the cell membrane, and have roles in the biochemical defence against toxicants  <cit> . the abc transporter p-glycoprotein transports ivm  <cit>  and has relevance as a biochemical factor limiting the drug’s toxicity in mice and nematodes  <cit> . it has been suggested that p-glycoprotein could be implicated in the resistance of pests and parasites to avms  <cit> , and a salmon louse homologue of p-glycoprotein called sl-pgy <dig> has been cloned  <cit> . in the present study, mrna expression of sl-pgy <dig> was unaffected by emb treatment and did not differ between s and pt strains , confirming similar data previously reported for these strains  <cit> .

in addition to comparing transcriptional profiles between louse strains in the absence of drug exposure, the present study also addresses transcriptomic responses of both louse strains to short-term exposures  to 200 μg l- <dig> of emb. the selected emb concentration is not toxic to the resistant salmon louse strain, but in the drug-susceptible strain it results in close to 100% immotility after 24 hours exposure. after  <dig> to 3 hours of exposure, few transcriptomic responses were observed in the resistant strain, and therefore these data do not provide evidence for the presence of specific resistance mechanisms requiring transcriptional regulation. in the drug-susceptible strain, a complex array of transcriptional responses to emb was observed. this finding was expected, as this level of emb exposure was known to result in significant toxic responses after 24 hours. early transcriptional responses are therefore likely to comprise both adaptive and general stress responses, as well as transcriptional changes reflecting the toxic action of the drug.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptional profiling of a drug susceptible and an emb resistant laboratory strain of salmon lice revealed reduced mrna expression of a number of lgic subunits in the emb resistant lice. glucl, considered to be the major target site of avm drugs in invertebrates, displayed similar mrna expression levels in emb-resistant and reference strains. in contrast, subunits of gaba-cl and nachr showed decreased mrna abundances in the emb resistant compared to the reference strain. while gaba-cl is considered a secondary target of avms in invertebrates, nachr is not traditionally considered a target site for avms, even though it has been shown to interact with avms in vertebrates. it is possible that nachr and gaba-cl represent additional emb target sites in salmon lice, and that the down-regulation of these channel subunits in this emb-resistant strain could be related to the resistance phenotype. in the present study no changes were seen in the expression levels of biotransformation enzymes and drug transporters, both of which classes have been suggested to contribute to avm resistance in other species. further studies are needed to investigate potential relationships between the transcriptional changes observed and the susceptibility phenotype.
