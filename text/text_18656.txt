BACKGROUND
the pepino  is a neglected herbaceous domesticate native to the andean region, where wild relatives  are naturally distributed  <cit> . the pepino is a vegetatively propagated cultigen grown for its fruit. the fruits are juicy berries, of variable shape and color depending on the cultivar, which typically weighs between  <dig> and  <dig> g. the fruit has an attractive appearance, with most common cultivars producing fruits with a golden yellow skin covered with purple stripes. nutritionally, the pepino has very high levels of potassium and vitamin c, and a low calorie content  <cit> . apart from being cultivated in its region of origin, the pepino has been introduced in other countries like new zealand, china and turkey as a potential new horticultural crop  <cit> .

one of the most interesting features of the pepino is its phylogenetically close relationship with the potato and tomato  <cit> . in fact, the pepino and its wild relatives in solanum sect. basarthrum are part of the tertiary gene pool of both potato and tomato  <cit> . cultivated potato, tomato and pepino share the same basic number of chromosomes   <cit> , although tomato and pepino are diploid and most cultivated potato cultivars are polyploid  <cit> . importantly, the close phylogenetic relationship among these species allows the use of genomic resources from tomato and potato for pepino breeding, as has been demonstrated with the high transferability of tomato ssrs to the pepino  <cit> . reciprocally, the close relationship may also facilitate the use of the pepino as a genetic source for tomato and potato breeding including resistance to several diseases in both crops, and the transfer of parthenocarpy and improved flavor in the tomato  <cit> . the first step in introgression of pepino traits into tomato, have been obtained via the construction of tomato-pepino somatic hybrids  <cit> .

wild relatives of domesticates are a source of variation for improving cultivated species  <cit>  and for studying the domestication process  <cit> . in this context, s. caripense dunal, locally known as “mamoncillo” or “tzimbalo”, is important: it is easily hybridized with the pepino, and hybrids are highly fertile  <cit> . aflp and genic dna sequence studies indicated that s. caripense is one of the species that has been involved in the origin and evolution of the cultivated pepino  <cit> . in the andean region the widely distributed s. caripense and other cross-compatible wild relatives frequently grow in close proximity to the fields and gardens of the cultivated pepino; as a consequence, there is evidence of introgression and gene flow among them  <cit> . solanum caripense is of particular interest because of traits for pepino breeding such as high levels of soluble solids content  <cit> , or a high content of bioactive phenolic acids  <cit> . in addition, some accessions of s. caripense have displayed resistance to tomato mosaic virus   <cit>  and to phytophthora infestans  <cit> , the most important disease of potato  <cit> , and could offer alternative sources of variation for breeding for resistance to these diseases.

despite being an important crop in the andean region during pre-columbian times  <cit>  and despite its potential as a new crop for many areas with mild climates, there have been few molecular studies of, and few molecular tools developed for s. muricatum - the pepino. neither the pepino or its significant wild relatives have been thoroughly studied at a genome-wide level in the context of molecular studies and tools. as of july  <dig>  only  <dig> nucleotide sequences had been deposited in the ncbi’s genbank database, all of them resulting from a single study  <cit> . in addition, there are few studies of molecular markers and their application in pepinos. some of the previous studies used cp-dna restriction fragments length polymorphism   <cit> , aflp and gene sequence haplotypes  <cit> , rapds  <cit>  and est-ssrs derived from tomato  <cit> , to study diversity in the pepino and its wild relatives. apart from these studies, an intra-specific low-density genetic map with snps taken from the sequencing of a set of cosii was produced in the pepino wild relative s. caripense with the aim of mapping the resistance to phytophthora infestans  <cit> .

high throughput sequencing of transcriptomes  has opened the way to study the genetic and functional information in neglected crops and species. rna-seq is genome-independent and is especially useful for analyzing the transcriptome of species without complete genome information or a reference genome  <cit> , as is the case of the pepino and wild relatives. in this context, rna-seq can be helpful for:  listing the transcripts and other rnas from one or several tissues;  investigating the transcriptional structure of genes, splicing patterns, and gene isoforms;  studying post-transcriptional modification and mutations; and  quantifying gene expression  <cit> . the transcriptomics studied have provided a basis for: scanning the evolution of polyploidy in plants  <cit> , study of phylogenies in some families including the solanaceae  <cit> , comparing patterns associated with domestication  <cit> , and finally for developing markers en masse .

in the present work, we used the illumina pair-end sequencing technology to perform rna-seq of one modern cultivar of the pepino and of one accession of the pepino wild relative s. caripense. we obtained almost  <dig> million reads including sequencing of both species. our transcriptome analysis included de novo assembly, structural and functional annotation and comparison with tomato and potato genomes  <cit> , providing us the opportunity to establish a dated phylogeny of the pepino compared with related species. candidate genes, mainly from tomato agronomic traits of interest have also been found. these genes can provide us an effective comparative approximation of patterns of selection in domestication, and will allow us to identify genes useful for the genetic improvement of the pepino. another important goal is the discovery of the high throughput markers . these gene-derived markers are important functionally in that they can provide potential changes in the proteins expressed, and they offer an essential tool to be utilized in the construction of genetic maps, and they can be used in marker-assisted selection. the rest of the dataset will serve as a public information platform for gene expression and genomics in the pepino and their related species, particularly useful for future studies in pepino, potato, and tomato genomics and breeding. this is a seminal work that will pave the way to broader genomic studies in pepino, a neglected species with great interest for future development, and as a reservoir of important genes for tomato and potato improvement as well.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing  output and assembly
we performed two illumina hiseq- <dig> runs, one for the s. muricatum cultivar sweet long  and one for s. caripense   <cit> . the rna sequencing of three tissues  from s. muricatum generated  <dig> , <dig> raw paired-end reads, covering about  <dig>  gb of sequencing raw data . in the case of s. caripense, sequencing generated  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig>  gb of raw data. graphical representation of sequence quality is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  where the quality scores across all the bases is indicated. all these raw paired-end data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive. after initial trimming and quality filtering to remove adapters and low-quality data,  <dig> , <dig> clean paired end reads were obtained, encompassing  <dig>  gb of sequencing data in s. muricatum and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads and  <dig>  gb of sequencing data in s. caripense .table  <dig> summary of raw and clean reads after processing for s. muricatum and s. caripense

the high quality reads for s. muricatum were used to assemble the transcriptome using the trinity software. the results of this assembly are shown in table  <dig>  and the length distribution of the transcripts after assembly is shown in fig.  <dig>  the total of  <dig>   contigs were assembled with an average length of  <dig> bp. it should be noted that more than 63 %  of the transcripts are between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length and only 1 % of them had a sequence length greater than  <dig> bp. we have selected a subset of the transcripts, the selection based on the most expressed transcript of each trinity transcript cluster. we obtained  <dig>  of the most expressed transcripts  , with an average length of  <dig> bp. additionally, the percentage of g/c of the clean reads, usually used as an indicator of closeness between species, was calculated. the value for s. muricatum was  <dig>  % and for s. caripense it was  <dig>  % . these values are consistent with those reported for other solanum species  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of the solanum muricatum transcriptome assembly. after assembly in the first group , and after filtering by level of expression

functional annotation
to identify s. muricatum transcripts potentially encoding proteins with a known function, a blastx analysis was performed sequentially using three protein databases  <cit> . the order of application of the databases used was: swiss-prot  <cit> , itag <dig>  from tomato  <cit>  and uniref <dig>  <cit> , . more than  <dig>  % of the transcripts  had at least one significant hit. most of the transcripts with annotation had significant hits in swiss-prot , representing  <dig>  % of the total of unigenes, an expected result for a manually curated database. the hits obtained in the rest of databases were: itag <dig>  with  <dig>  % of the sequences annotated and uniref <dig> with  <dig>  % of the sequences annotated. the results are presented in table  <dig> and they are similar to those found in other studies . to facilitate further study, the blast results are listed in an additional file  <dig> table  <dig> functional annotation summary of the pepino sequences over protein databases. first the most expressed transcripts were annotated in swiss-prot database. then, unpaired transcripts in this annotation were evaluated in the next database, itag <dig> . and finally, the unpaired at this level, were evaluated in the uniref <dig> database



using blast2go against the nr database, we recovered gene ontology  terms and enzyme commission numbers  for the most expressed transcripts or unigenes in s. muricatum. a total of  <dig>  go terms were assigned to  <dig>  transcripts. the distribution of unigenes relative to the number of gos to which they were assigned is shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  slightly more than half of the unigenes  have between  <dig> and  <dig> go terms, and 12 % have more than  <dig> go terms. the maximum number of go terms annotated in a unigene was  <dig>  among all the go terms extracted,  <dig>   belong to the molecular function class ,  <dig>   to biological process class  and  <dig>   to cellular components class .

the distribution of annotated transcripts under different go levels shows a concentration, between levels 4– <dig> in the biological process, between levels 3– <dig> in molecular function and between levels 5– <dig> in cellular components . the go levels that ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  were  <dig>  % for biological processes,  <dig>  % for molecular function and  <dig>  % for cellular components, indicating that the precision of the annotation was good , and that a broad diversity of genes was sampled in our transcriptome. most of the genes in the go analysis were classified into biological process  of cellular processes, metabolic processes, biosynthetic processes and response to stress . notably, many sequences were classified in the category of development for different plant structures, like embryo and flower development, pollen-pistil interaction and fruit ripening. all of these functions are related to the three tissues sampled .fig.  <dig> go level distribution in each category for the annotated pepino unigenes. x axis represent the go level and y axis the number of annotated unigenes. bp = biological process, mf = molecular function, cc = cellular component

fig.  <dig> gene ontology classification by plant slim term for level  <dig>  the graphic indicates the number of transcripts for every process and functional category, cellular components , biological process  and molecular function and 



the enzyme commission  number is a codification for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they catalyse  <cit> . we found a total of  <dig>  annotations classified under this scheme involving  <dig>  different unigenes . the most prominent among the enzymes were: transferases  with  <dig> sequences, hydrolases  with  <dig> sequences and oxidoreductases  with  <dig> sequences annotated . other enzyme classes like ligases, lyases and isomerases were represented to a lesser degree. the number of annotated sequences so recognized was greater than in other studies in the solanaceae  <cit> . the complete list of these ec numbers is included in the additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> number of unigenes for each enzyme commission  category



in order to understand the function of the unigenes in pepino, a blastx search against the kegg protein database with a cut-off e value of 1e− <dig> was performed. out of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>  were annotated in the kegg pathway database, and assigned to  <dig> unique pathways. these pathways include amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, as well as biosynthesis of secondary metabolites like flavonoids and terpenoids. our results show that the largest three pathway groups were purine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism . given that the pepino is largely a dessert fruit in which sugars and bioactive compounds are important for quality  <cit> , we paid special attention to the pathways pertaining to starch and sucrose metabolism, and to biosynthesis of carotenoids, anthocyanins, and several vitamins. a considerable number of genes were related to relevant metabolic pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism , carotenoid biosynthesis , anthocyanin biosynthesis , ascorbate and alderate metabolism , vitamin b <dig> metabolism , retinol  metabolism , thiamine  metabolism , riboflavin  metabolism , and biotin  metabolism . finally, we compared the number of genes assigned for every kegg pathway in our analysis with the analogous genes assigned in tomato and potato genomes. this comparison like other comparisons we made, indicated many similarities, and implies a not-surprising close relationship among the three species . these data points also indicate that we have a good representation of the transcriptome. the number of genes annotated in the pepino was notably lower than in the tomato and potato in very few pathways. this is because some processes may not be properly represented in our samples because they derive from mrna of three tissues, and we do not have a representation of the whole genome. other processes instead, are better represented. the results of this comparison is presented in additional file  <dig> 

candidate genes
several candidate genes related to traits of interest for domestication and breeding were studied. these include genes involved in the inflorescence type, fruit development  <cit> , and synthesis of anthocyanins, chlorogenic acid, saponins, and sucroses. these genes were evaluated for presence or absence in our assembled transcriptome and compared with the transcripts of s. caripense . the level of similarity given by the score and the e-value is also shown. the number of nucleotidic variants between s. muricatum and s. caripense was also indicated in order to compare differences between these closely related species.table  <dig> candidate genes studied affecting traits of importance in different solanaceae. traits and genes affecting inflorescence, fruit stripes, fruit shape, anthocyanins route, chlorogenic acid pathway, saponines pathway, and sucrose accumulation are included. more information the candidate genes section of material and methods and in additional file 8: table s1



the majority of the genes described in other related species are present in our assembled transcriptome . it should be noted that each of these genes are present too in s. caripense. in most cases, there are few differences in these sequences and only nine are identical among the two species. these results are summarized in additional file 8: table s <dig>  interestingly, the greatest differences between the cultigen and the wild species were found in genes related to characters like fruit stripes, anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid synthesis. these differences obviously relate to characters selected in artificial selection by ancient domesticators, and they also offer a clear idea about the variability available in the wild species that may be utilized in pepino breeding.

comparison with potato and tomato genomes
all of the most expressed transcripts  were blasted to the potato genome, resulting in  <dig>   sequences mapped. furthermore, and similarly,  <dig>   transcripts of pepino were mapped to the tomato genome. these comparisons allowed us to determine the quality of our assembly, to compare the number of genes with the model species , and to substantially increase our understanding of these newly generated species genomes. in addition to this, the distribution of the pepino unigenes relative to the potato and tomato genomes was plotted using circos software . this graphical representation provides visual information of the location of the coding regions, but full information on chromosomal realignment and other changes awaits the development of the sequence of the whole pepino genome.fig.  <dig> graphical representation of the pepino unigenes positions on the chromosomes of potato  and tomato  and nucleotide-level variants distribution/density found on these chromosomes. a distribution of the pepino unigenes on chromosomes,  ideograms of the  <dig> chromosomes, black bar indicates the approximated position of the centromere,  variants distribution/density, every column indicates the number of variants per mb



we have generated gene model predictions comparing our assembled transcriptome of s. muricatum with the tomato genome  <cit> . this alignment of the unigenes to the tomato genomic dna was performed using the est2genome software, and the orfs annotations were carried out using estscan software  <cit> . a large number  of the most expressed transcripts were predicted to have one orf . on the other hand, we predicted the presence of introns in our unigenes. we found  <dig>  in a total of  <dig>  unigenes , which means  <dig>  introns per unigene, with a maximum number of  <dig>  knowledge of the positions of these intronic regions is particularly important for discovery of snps and indels. the previously generated intron map allows us to discard those that are located in the vicinity of an intron, because that would make it difficult to design the primers to amplify these regions. the annotation results  are deposited in additional file  <dig> in gff <dig> format.

molecular phylogeny among solanaceae species
we used five genes for a phylogenetic study of the pepino and five other solanaceae crops . these genes were waxy or gbssi  <cit> , samt  <cit> , adh, β-amylase and cesa  <cit> . after confirming that these genes are represented in our transcriptome, they were concatenated and aligned using clustalw. the total length of the sequence analyzed was of  <dig> bp including the five genes. variations among the sequences were found for a total of  <dig> positions, of which  <dig> were parsimony-informative, i.e., these sites contain at least two types of nucleotides, and at least two of them occur with a minimum frequency of two. results of this alignment are presented in additional file  <dig> 

after alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed among the six species using the software mega <dig>  <cit> . the statistical method used was the maximum likelihood, but results were similar using other methods like, neighbor joining, upgma and maximum parsimony . the estimated divergence time of tomato-potato , was fixed at the intermediate value of  <dig>  mya and was used for time calibration. the tree constructed  shows that the ancestors of pepino and of potato and tomato diverged at around  <dig>  mya. other divergence estimates are between eggplant, an african member of the family solanaceae and the rest of the american solanum, occurred  <dig> mya.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship among solanaceae species. the number in the nodes indicates the estimated time of divergence . the length of the branches is proportional to the divergence time. bootstrap values are not shown as it is 100 % in all nodes



ssr and nucleotide-level variants discovery
we performed a general screening on the s. muricatum transcriptome for the presence of microsatellites , analyzing length, type and quality. we focused in the search for di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats, with a length limited to  <dig> repetitions. the total of potential ssrs was  <dig> from  <dig> unigenes; that is, approximately  <dig>  % of the transcripts contain ssrs . the maximum and minimum lengths of the ssr repeats were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . tri-nucleotide repeats  were the most commonly found repetitions in our transcriptome accounting for almost 66 % of the ssrs identified. the most common motif was aag  representing  <dig>  % of the tri-nucleotide ssrs; other common repeats were ag  representing  <dig>  %, and aac representing the  <dig>  % of the tri-nucleotide ssrs. others motifs found in our analysis are summarized in table  <dig>  the completed list of ssrs and their characteristics are provided in the additional file  <dig> table  <dig> single sequence repeat  statistics according to the type of motif, the percentage of each motif and the amount of unigenes with ssrs. complete information about these markers is shown in additional file 10




high throughput sequencing of both transcriptomes has made possible to obtain a large collection of snps and indels. the variant calling was carried out using the default parameters recommended by the freebayes software  <cit> , which allows distinguishing and recognizing sequence variations from sequencing errors and mutations introduced during cdna synthesis. the implementation of several filters described in the methods has also allowed obtaining markers of potentially high quality, allowing their use in high throughput genotyping platforms  <cit> . apart from this, the caps filter can be especially useful when other methods for snps detection are not available.

applying these criteria, we identified a total of  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels in s. muricatum , and  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels in s. caripense , as well as  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels shared by both species  . within the detected snps, as usual, transitions  were much more abundant than transversions , given that transitions are less likely to result in amino acid substitutions, and are therefore more likely to persist as silent substitutions  <cit> . within transitions and transversions, both, a/t and c/t were equally abundant . the complete list of these snps is provided in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> single nucleotide variants statistics for the s. muricatum and s. caripense transcriptomes






in order to determine their position, heterozygous intra and interspecific nucleotide-level variants were located in the tomato and potato genomes using the comparison files explained above. this analysis is summed up in table  <dig>  where we indicate the number of nucleotide-level variants predicted for every chromosome as well as their hypothetical position and density on chromosomes .table  <dig> distribution of pepino nucleotide-level variants on chromosomes of tomato and potato



discussion
we employed ngs technology for the first time for sequencing the transcriptome of pepino and its related wild species s. caripense. there is no reference genome for these species, consequently we used successfully the de novo assembly method  <cit> . using this methodology a large number of most expressed transcripts or unigenes  were obtained, with an average length of  <dig> bp. we were pleased that the number of unigenes obtained in this project is similar to or better than that obtained in previous studies using similar technologies, thus demonstrating the quality and potential utility of our work, both in sample preparation and assembling protocol  <cit> . the high initial quality of the unigenes we have obtained is of fundamental importance for the remainder of the work.

the mrna-seq methodology gives the g/c content  among unigenes. as a consequence of the nature of the chemical bond between g and c, this base pair is considered more stable than the a/t base pair. thus, during evolution, variation in the g/c content would accumulate more slowly . accordingly, given the g/c content, markedly variable among different organisms  <cit> , would be an indicator of closeness between species. the g/c contents obtained  were consistent with values found in other solanum  <cit> . in particular, the tomato g/c content for cdna reported in previous studies was  <dig>  %  <cit> , and for potato, the value is similar . this suggest that the s. muricatum transcriptome represents a typical example of a solanaceae transcriptome, thereby raising the probability of successfully employing our data for broader comparative studies in this genus.

the assembled unigenes were functionally annotated in order to better understanding the role of the genes represented. the knowledge of the functional role of the genes increases the probability of utilizing them for pepino breeding and demonstrates the possible ways in which the wild relatives of pepino could be of interest in developing new varieties. the annotation percentages in the different protein databases were similar to those obtained in other similar projects . most of the sequences were annotated in swiss-prot  <cit> . since swissprot is a highly-curated, highly-crossreferenced, and non-redundant database, that has a lower error rate than the automatically created databases, which gives high annotation reliability. the percentage of protein annotations in the other databases  was smaller, as expected. the go annotation indicated that the majority of the unigenes were involved in molecular, cellular and biological processes. within the molecular function category, the majority of the unigenes were assigned to different binding processes, hydrolase activity and catalytic activity. the majority of genes in the cellular component sequences functioned in cell and organelle structures .

the kegg pathway database is a resource for the systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of networks of genes and molecules in cells and their variants specific to particular organisms  <cit> . in our case, this analysis included  <dig> pathways involving  <dig>  unigenes, importantly including pathways key to success in a dessert fruit like pepino. for example we had representation of important pathways like starch and sucrose metabolism, biosynthesis of carotenoids and anthocyanins and several vitamins . identifying changes in these genes and associating them with phenological differences will enable us to more efficiently manage future breeding programs involving these species  <cit> . perhaps because we used transcripts representing only three tisues , the comparison of the kegg pathways we identified with those obtained from the potato and tomato genomes shows that some processes were not very well represented in the pepino or s. caripense. despite this, our transcriptome data are an excellent representation of the metabolic processes that, with further analysis of these pathway-related genes, will improve our understanding of the pepino features, some of them unique and others shared with the rest of the solanaceae  <cit> . obviously, the transcriptome data can contribute to expanding and enhancing the breeding resources for and with these species.

as a preliminary test of the application of our results to breeding programs, a set of candidate genes described from other solanaceae were evaluated for their presence in the pepino transcriptome, and the associated nucleotide changes in s. caripense. these genes selected were either characters associated with domestication or those with potential for enhancement through breeding. the caveats we worked with in running these preliminary tests included recognition that there are large differences in nucleotide changes between s. muricatum and s. caripense in some characters of interest, like anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid synthesis . there are significant morphological and fruit composition differences between the pepino and wild s. caripense; for example, differences related to plant habit, leaf complexity, trailing habit and seediness of the fruits  <cit> . correspondingly, our data demonstrate the existence of many differences at genomic level, including genes that are of great interest for breeding. thus, we think this foundational work will provide the basis for broader studies, such as those where an in-depth and accurate phenotypic characterization can be related to changes at the nucleotide level. these kinds of studies may be helpful for understanding the genetics of these key characters, for providing a foundation for positive selection in the domestication process, and for establishing a breeding program  <cit> . for example, we have found concentrations of chlorogenic acid, a powerful bioactive molecule with application to human health as an antioxidant  <cit> , to be much higher in s. caripense than in the cultivated s. muricatum . sequence differences found can be used as functional markers for marker-assisted breeding to transfer alleles from s. caripense to pepino. in this regard, differentially expressed genes  analysis  <cit> , could be interesting for clearing up differences at the expression level in several developmental stages and tissues, which may provide relevant information about pepino domestication. furthermore, the information obtained may be used for tomato or potato improvement in the near future using modern technologies for gene editing like crispr/cas  <cit> , or by transformation using cisgenic approaches  <cit> .

another issue to consider in a de novo assembly of a transcriptome is the genic structure. in this regard, we have generated gene model predictions comparing our assembled transcriptome of s. muricatum with the tomato genome  <cit> . because these two species are very closely related  <cit> , this is a valid approach until, full genome sequencing is available.

other genes present in our assembled transcriptome are used to study phylogenetic relationships within this large, and economically important, family , and the sequence differences in pepino with other solanaceae were used to elucidate its relationship. further confidence in our results comes from the fact that they are consistent with previous studies such as spooner et al.  <cit> , wang et al.  <cit>  and garzon-martinez et al.  <cit> , and the fact that the divergence times estimated are congruent with data deposited in timetree  <cit>  . our data indicate that the divergence among all the solanaceae studied here  occurred in the last  <dig> million years. the pepino and the tomato-potato clade shared a common ancestor from which they diverged  <dig>  mya. other divergence estimates indicate that the eggplant, an african member of the family solanaceae, and the rest of the american solanum, occurred  <dig> mya.

the total of potential ssrs obtained was  <dig> in  <dig> unigenes; that is, approximately  <dig>  % of the transcripts contain ssrs . the number of ssrs are slightly lower than expected, or at least lower than obtained in similar studies  <cit> . this may be due to the application of strongest criteria on our study, the advantage being that we should have obtained markers of better quality. in any case, the number of markers is adequate to develop a high density genetic map, and for genetic diversity studies and marker assisted breeding studies.

as stated above, tri-nucleotide repeats were the most commonly found repetitions in our transcriptome accounting for almost 66 % of the ssrs identified. the tri-nucleotide repeats may be the most common because these ssrs do not change the frameshift and mutations have less dramatic effect  <cit> . there is considerable evidence that genic ssrs have important functions. for example, it has been postulated that ssrs may affect chromatin organization, and they also may be related to regulation of gene activity, recombination, and dna replication  <cit> . extra-genic ssr markers have several advantages beyond genomic ssrs because they are related to codifying sequences, and thus can be used as candidate genes to study association with phenotypic variation. extra-genic ssr markers can be useful for genetic diversity studies, as demonstrated for pepino when using tomato est-ssrs  <cit> , for the development of genetic maps and for fingerprinting commercial cultivars, breeding lines or landraces  <cit> .

by applying several bioinformatic approaches, we obtained a total of  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels in solanum muricatum, and  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels in s. caripense, as well as  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels between the two species  . these nucleotide-level variant markers show that both clones present an important degree of heterozygosis, although the highest number of intraclone markers was obtained in s. caripense. this makes sense, given that s. caripense is an obligately allogamous wild species with a gametophytic self-incompatiblity system  <cit> .

the large number of snps markers developed can be readily used in pepino research. these markers exhibit co-dominant inheritance and due to their abundance, they are widely used for different applications. some of these applications include: diversity studies, development of saturated molecular genetic and physical maps, identification of qtls or genes controlling traits of economic importance, marker-assisted selection, or association mapping with genome-wide association studies   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study constitutes the first genomic resource for pepino, a cultigen closely related to tomato and potato  <cit> . these genomic studies are especially important because they promote the understanding of crop evolution in this group, and pepino enhancement. furthermore, because the pepino is part of the tertiary genepool of tomatoes and potatoes  <cit> , these genomic studies, provide a wide array of genomic information that may be useful for breeding in those groups as well. the high quality of the transcriptome presented here will enhance comparative studies within the genus solanum, and will be useful for future annotations of the s. muricatum genome sequence. the detailed annotation provided in this work will facilitate the use of sequenced unigenes for gene discovery, in particular for traits of interest within pepino . in addition to the pepino, sequencing of the transcriptome of its sister wild relative s. caripense has allowed identification of a large number of molecular markers , within each species, as well as between them. the filtering process applied in the search of these variants has facilitated the selection of the most suitable markers for high throughput genotyping platforms. our results are an example of how high throughput sequencing technologies can contribute to knowledge of domesticates with no or limited genomic information, but where there are closely related species with the whole genome sequence available. our assembled transcriptome, and the large collection of markers found, will enhance pepino breeding, facilitate molecular studies in this crop, and will be useful to develop the first genetic map of the pepino. ultimately, the genomic information obtained will be of interest for tomato and potato breeding and for studying genomic changes during evolution and crop domestication in these important crops.
