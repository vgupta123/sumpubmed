BACKGROUND
every year, cereal breeders in international agricultural research centres that helped produce the green revolution make hundreds, or thousands, of crosses and derive only small populations from each one. this breeding strategy is perpetuated because high-volume crossing, despite the inevitable inefficiency of having many failed crosses, produced the iconic green revolution varieties that were successful in dramatically increasing yields from the 1960s to the present day, and because it continues to produce genetic gains in crop yield. hence there has been little momentum for change even though a high-volume cross approach is very difficult to employ in more modestly funded national programmes. however, changes ought to be considered because making so many crosses that most must fail is not justified either by theory or comparative experiment.

experimental data for breeding programmes with contrasting cross numbers have not been reported in the literature, which is unsurprising given the size of the experiments required. for example, to test varying combinations of m  and n , an ideal experiment is two breeding programmes having the same total number of plants , the same selection methods, but contrasting values for m and n. this demands huge resources but will still only test one possible strategy for selecting the crosses in the low m set. other experimental approaches such as combining ability tests  do not resolve the problem; although they can provide estimates of the relative values of different crosses they cannot predict the probabilities of favourable genotypes occurring as population size varies.

we tested whether a few cross strategy could succeed in rice and compared it with contemporaneous rice-breeding programmes that used the conventional many-cross approach. within realistic limits of resources, this was the best possible comparison to test the hypothesis inherent in the many-cross strategy that a programme based on few crosses, however chosen, will inevitably fail. we report on only the first six of our stringently chosen crosses because these are the only ones for which there has been sufficient time for the outcomes to be known.

the justification for using fewer crosses was that breeders could predict the better crosses using existing information on the performance per se of parents. combining ability tests are a resource-demanding alternative. such tests determine means and variances, but they involve the growing and measuring more than three generations of plants as f2-derived lines must be tested
 <cit>  and spending the time and resources appears unwarranted. however, genotypic performance per se provides an indication of parental value
 <cit>  and an abundance of information is already available for genotypes that have already been adopted by farmers or have been officially released.

the theory on how many crosses to make has helped little in deciding the optimum number. models are based on either minimising the risk of excluding superior genotypes
 <cit>  or maximising the response to selection. we consider only the first of these two approaches in this paper. these models determine the optimum number of crosses  and population size  per cross, given a limit of k plants. however, contrasting assumptions on how well breeders can predict the value of crosses result in very different optima. only one cross is needed if a successful cross can be predicted with certainty. however, many are required if there is little power of prediction and this was assumed by yonezawa and yamagata because they had a constant value for the probability of success of each cross no matter how many crosses were made
 <cit> .

we dropped this assumption because it is based on an extraordinary premise - that the breeder has no ability to choose crosses that are more likely to succeed. it is more realistic for the probability of success of each cross combination to differ according to the information available to the breeder for choosing possible cross combinations. the reliability of the prediction will decline as the number of crosses increase based on a law of diminishing returns; as the number of crosses increases the quality and quantity of available information on the parents diminishes. weber
 <cit>  did consider crosses having a greater chance of good genotypes than in others, and concluded it may be better to enlarge the size of the progenies from more favourable crosses and to reduce the whole number of crosses. however, he concluded that it is usually not optimal to exclude less favourable crosses but did not generalise on what was the optimum number.

success rate of the six crosses – evidence from official recognition and adoption by farmers
several varieties have received official recognition in nepal and india  reflecting their performance on station and on farm. the first cross produced ashoka 200f and ashoka  <dig> and these were released in  <dig> as birsa vikas dhan  <dig> and  <dig> for the rainfed uplands of jharkhand state, india. later, ashoka 200f was officially recommended for cultivation in gujarat in  <dig>  and madhya pradesh and rajasthan in  <dig>  in  <dig>  barkhe  <dig> was officially released in nepal followed by the release of barkhe  <dig> in india and the registration of barkhe  <dig> in nepal. the third cross produced one variety that has been released in nepal and one in india. several varieties have performed well in bangladesh, but the operation of the seeds act makes it impossible to get these released. various outcome assessment studies have shown that many more varieties than those that have been released have been adopted

probabilities that the success rate of the six crosses significantly exceeded those in many cross breeding programmes in nepal, bangladesh and irri
we calculated how frequently the success rates we had would occur by chance given the same success rates of the breeding programmes in nepal, bangladesh and the international rice research institute  . we determined the number of crosses made by these three programmes in a defined period and the number of releases in an equivalent but later period to allow for about an 8-year lag phase.

in nepal, from  <dig> to  <dig>  the national research system made  <dig> crosses for the low altitude regions and  <dig> crosses for the hills . in the 32-year period from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> rice varieties were released in nepal. of these,  <dig> were from crosses made in nepal
 <cit>  . this was an overall success rate of about  <dig> cross in  <dig> although for the terai it was only  <dig> in  <dig> and for the hills  <dig> in  <dig>  at the bangladesh rice research institute   <dig> crosses were made from  <dig> to 1997
 <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> rice varieties were released. at least  <dig> of them were not from crosses made at brri, so about  <dig> cross in  <dig> resulted in a released variety but farmers have not adopted all of these. unpublished information indicates similar success rates in india. irri made more than two thousand crosses a year
 <cit>  from approximately 1965– <dig> . by  <dig>   <dig> breeding lines from irri had been released as  <dig> varieties  in  <dig> countries
 <cit>  giving an estimated success rate of about  <dig> in  <dig> 

was our high success rate of  <dig> in  <dig> a significant improvement over that in a many-cross breeding programme or due to chance? we determined the likelihood of producing a success rate of  <dig> in  <dig> if six crosses were randomly selected from a breeding programme where  <dig> in  <dig> crosses succeed. it was extremely improbable that the random selection would include four successful crosses, and unlikely that it would include three . hence, our high success rate was not by chance but because the stringent crosses were more likely to succeed. if we apply the most rigorous definition of success – that a variety also has to be released as well as adopted - then the success rate would fall to  <dig> in  <dig> . even with a success of  <dig> in  <dig> the results remain highly significant, p< <dig>  .

we can also determine how high the success rate needs to be in a conventional programme for our results to become non-significant. for  <dig> from  <dig> crosses to be successful by chance the successful crosses in a conventional programme would need to rise to  <dig> per  <dig>  or  <dig> per  <dig> . such increases of  <dig> to  <dig> fold over the overall reported rates of about  <dig>  per  <dig>  and four fold more than the highest rate for the hills in nepal, and are beyond any errors that might be expected in the documented success rate of the three conventional breeding programmes in nepal, bangladesh and irri.

by country, the success rate was  <dig> out of  <dig> for bangladesh ,  <dig> out of  <dig> for india  and  <dig> out of  <dig> for nepal . the standard error associated with a proportion of success of  <dig>  is ±  <dig>  and we have conservatively used a value of  <dig> , lower than the lower range of the se, to model the optimum cross number.

optimum number of crosses when the probability of success of each cross declines as more crosses are made
we have shown that using performance per se as an indicator of parental value allowed cross combinations to be selected that had a higher probability of success than more random ones. hence, to model optimum cross number p <dig>  should not be a constant, but decline as more crosses are made, because the quantity and quality of relevant information for choosing crosses on performance per se also declines.

because there are no experimental data on how the quantity and quality of knowledge on performance per se of potential parents declines with the number of crosses that are made, we modelled the rate that fits best with our experience . we also examined other, contrasting, feasible relationships: a linear decline in knowledge of the parents the more crosses are made  or an exponential decline. the initial levels of p <dig> were conservatively assumed to be lower than those we found experimentally , and it was assumed p <dig> would decline as more crosses were made to fall the level of  <dig>  typically found in high cross breeding programmes.

no matter what particular rate of decline is assumed, it always results in many crosses  being less efficient than a few  across a range of k . only when there is a linear decline in p <dig> and values of k are high is there a tiny advantage  in using  <dig> crosses over  <dig>  however, making fewer crosses remains the most efficient option as the insignificant gain in overall probability is outweighed by the increased cost of making more crosses.

with  <dig> crosses, k can be reduced substantially  with only a small reduction in the probability of overall success .

we modelled three further scenarios:  having lower initial values of p <dig>   different values for p <dig>  and  co-varying p <dig> with p <dig> 

 when the initial values of p <dig> are lower than  <dig>  making fewer crosses is still advantageous. for the s-shaped decline,  <dig> crosses only become superior to  <dig> when p <dig> falls to  <dig>  , while  <dig> crosses are always superior to  <dig> for the exponential decline no matter how small is p <dig>  for the linear decline the initial value of p <dig> had to fall to about  <dig>  before  <dig> crosses had any advantage over  <dig> .

 the value of p <dig>  is important – smaller values of p <dig> greatly increase the advantage of using fewer crosses, albeit to differing extents, in the three rates of decline of p <dig>  for example, with p <dig> initially equal to  <dig>  and k =  <dig>  we compared the overall probabilities of success when p <dig> was equal to  <dig>  or  <dig> . with the lower value of p <dig>  the advantage of  <dig> crosses over  <dig> is  <dig>  times larger in the case of an s-shaped decline,  <dig> times larger for a linear decline, and  <dig>  times larger for an exponential decline.

 moreover, the yonezawa and yamagata model uses high values of p <dig> since they are based on the recovery of favourable heterozygous or homozygous genotypes in the f <dig> <cit> , and hence ignores the required population sizes in subsequent generations to obtain homozygous segregants. it is more realistic to model the probabilities of finding a desirable homozygote in an advanced selfing generation, and this can easily be applied to single seed descent where population size remains constant from the f <dig> to the advanced selfing generations. p <dig> is then very small because, for example, the probability of recovering a transgressive segregant favourable at  <dig> loci is  <dig> , and favourable at  <dig> loci it is  <dig> . the larger populations possible with fewer crosses are then most helpful in increasing the possibility of finding favourable genotypes.

 it is a reasonable assumption that the frequency of favourable plants in a cross is positively related to the probability that a cross will succeed, i.e., p <dig> should be higher when p <dig> is higher. this increases the advantage of having fewer crosses but not by a large percentage.

optimum number of crosses when the probability of success of each cross is a constant
in great contrast to figure 
 <dig>  more crosses always increase the probability of success when p <dig> is assumed to be constant .

however, despite this there are counter arguments that favour fewer crosses. the higher the value of p <dig> the smaller the relative advantage of more crosses becomes . for example, when p <dig> =  <dig>  then  <dig> crosses gives a 179% increase in the overall probability of success compared with  <dig> . however, this falls to 13% when p <dig> =  <dig> , and to <1% when p <dig> =  <dig>  and such small advantages will not justify the cost of more crosses.

as discussed above, p <dig> becomes much smaller when the probability of recovering homozygotes in an advanced selfing generation is considered. the smaller p <dig> becomes, the smaller is the advantage of making more crosses. however, a smaller p <dig> has much less effect when p <dig> is constant compared with when it declines as more crosses are made .

fewer crosses allow an increase in population size but the yonezawa and yamagata model does not take the advantage of this into account, because it assumes that the probability of a cross being favourable, p <dig>  remains constant no matter how many plants are derived from it. this is because the model produces a ceiling for the number of plants beyond which an increase is of no benefit. for example, having more than  <dig>  plants in a cross when p <dig> =  <dig>  is of no benefit, as the risk of failing to find a favourable plant in an f <dig> population of this size has already fallen to zero. however, the favourable plant has advantageous alleles at a defined number of loci 
 <cit> . increasing the population size to give a high probability of recovering a plant with advantageous alleles at, say,  <dig> loci ought to increase p <dig> over having a smaller population size where  <dig> can be expected. because the model does not account for this improvement in p <dig> with increased population size, it is biased towards favouring more crosses rather than more plants per cross.

discussion
if p <dig> and p <dig> are assumed to be constant it is mathematically impossible using the equation of yonezawa and yamagata
 <cit>  for fewer crosses to have a higher overall probability success than many. however, if p <dig> is  <dig>  or above  making more crosses does not give sufficient increases in the overall probability of success to compensate for the additional costs. increasing cross number is resource demanding since it is both easier and cheaper to grow, for example,  <dig>  plants from each of ten crosses than  <dig> plants from each of  <dig> crosses. apart from the cost of having to make more crosses, it involves growing more field plots, having more labels and packets, gathering more data, and having more parental checks. a similar argument has previously been made even for when p <dig> was at more modest levels
 <cit> . for example, when p <dig> is  <dig>  or more and k is  <dig>  or more, the costs associated with having more crosses would be more decisive in deciding the optimal crossing scheme
 <cit> .

an alternative to the labour-intensive option of increasing m, is to increase k – although no more expensive, a few crosses with a large k is less risky than many crosses with a smaller k <cit> .

our model on optimum cross number is the first that shows that making more crosses can reduce plant breeding efficiency and has done so by making more realistic assumptions. our experiment showed that by using existing information on the performance per se of the parents we could predict, with a high probability, the best crosses to make. we did this by using the abundance of information already available on the traits of varieties adopted by farmers or officially released. we hence assumed that p <dig> must decline as more crosses are made because the available information on the performance per se of possible parents also declines. this equates to a law of diminishing returns as more crosses are made. the manner in which the diminishing returns occurred was not critical. all the three relationships of the decline between p <dig> and n we modelled, s-shape, linear and exponential, resulted in more crosses being less efficient than fewer. what does make a difference is how quickly the probability of success of each cross falls to that of more randomly made crosses. the longer it takes to fall to this level the less the disadvantage of making more crosses and vice versa.

from our experience, an s-shaped relationship between p <dig> and n is the most realistic assumption. we found it difficult to rank the best cross combinations among the relatively few genotypes for which there was well-proven performance per se in the target population of environments  over many years. hence, there was little to choose between the first and the next few crosses. after this, the quality of prediction would decline, as we would have to use parents for which there was less information on their performance in the tpes over fewer years. finally, there were many more possible parents for which we knew very little, may not even have been tested in the tpes, may only have been tested in a single season, and hence were only as likely to succeed as those in a conventional, many-cross programme.

experimentally, there is already much evidence on the success of using many crosses but little evidence has been provided on either the success or failure of the alternative approach of making only a few. we have positively answered the key question: can a few stringently selected crosses succeed by producing improved crop varieties that farmers adopt and, thereby, increase breeding efficiency? a few crosses succeeded because we were able to significantly increase the probability of success  of each cross over the low level found in conventional programmes. we then made the most practicable experimental comparison possible: determining if the p <dig> we found in our experiment was significantly better than that of many-cross breeding programmes from the same region and crop. it is the most comprehensive test, as far as we know, on the feasibility of the few cross approach for inbreeding crops.

for fewer crosses to succeed an increased likelihood of success of each cross has to be achieved by making greater efforts than normal to choose complementary parents. our crossing strategy was to cross parents that have been widely grown in the tpes over many seasons  either with new material from our breeding programme or with varieties identified using participatory varietal selection
 <cit> . more recently, we have been able cross the best lines that have emerged from our breeding programme  with the most popular, well-established local variety . breeding programmes with a global reach can also more carefully choose parents, and hence reduce the number of crosses, by making crosses with germplasm targeted at individual countries and domains
 <cit> .

a fewer-cross strategy greatly simplified the breeding scheme and saved resources. much larger f <dig> populations were possible with fewer crosses and they could be easily handled by using early-generation bulk populations
 <cit> . although larger population sizes were used for each cross - to ensure that a well-chosen cross has sufficient plants in its progeny to succeed - the overall size of the breeding programme can be reduced. we had about  <dig> ha of breeding material in each season. this was a smaller area than the smallest of the three rice breeding programmes to which we made comparisons, i.e., that of nrrp, but our programme produced released varieties at more than twice the rate. hence, a few-cross programme could achieve on about half the land area  the same release rate as a many-cross programme.

there is some other evidence that the few-cross approach is effective. another rice breeding programme in nepal by collaborators of the international plant genetic resources institute  has also relied on only a few crosses. one parent was always a local landrace because landrace utilization was an objective of the programme. even with this constraint on the choice of parents of only eight crosses, four have resulted in varieties that are in the release-, or pre-release, stage . at the west africa rice development association  many crosses are made each year. however, because the crosses were so difficult to make in a ‘wide-cross’ breeding programme between oryza sativa and o. glaberrima considerable effort was placed on choosing the parents of the crosses
 <cit> . only eight parents of glaberrima and five of sativa were chosen on the basis of their best combination of traits and only seven of the crosses set seed. all of the seven ‘new rice for africa’  varieties that were released in 2000
 <cit>  were from just one of these crosses, a success rate of 14%. as was the case for our crosses, this is a considerable improvement over normal success rates and our experience suggests that this was due to the great attention paid to choosing parents necessitated by the high cost of making these wide crosses. in maize, the parallel of a few-cross approach is to make only a single composite population and we tested this in western and eastern india. two populations were made, one for each region, and both have produced a released variety
 <cit> .

a breeding programme can be safely based on making very few crosses each year. the six crosses we analysed were made over a period of four years . with one cross a year, a success rate of 50% would be more than sufficient for a very successful programme. with two a year, a rate as low as 20% will give nearly a 90% probability of breeding a successful new variety every  <dig> years, which compares well with many national breeding programmes. these probabilities would be higher if, as we found, some of the crosses produced more than one released variety.

what if all breeders used only a few crosses? this would restrict the amount of germplasm used in crosses but not restrict the amount used in successful crosses. in conventional programmes, although many crosses are made most neither produce released varieties nor progeny that would be used in crosses to eventually produce a released variety. however, the exceptions are valuable, for example ir <dig> has an extremely complex parentage with  <dig> original farmer varieties from  <dig> countries as parents
 <cit> . clearly, not all of them would have previously been released varieties or parents of released varieties so many of the crosses were actually used for pre-breeding i.e., the creation of parents. hence, to deliberately broaden the genetic base of crops the range of parents has to extend beyond successful cultivars, resulting in an increase in the number of crosses . fewer crosses are highly appropriate for breeding programmes that have limited resources and that are targeted at specific environments, an apt description of most national, public-sector breeding programmes.

CONCLUSIONS
given the strong evidence that the chances of a cross succeeding can be considerably improved by the careful choice of cross combinations, we conclude that reducing the number of crosses increases plant breeding efficiency. this is contrary to the current practice in most breeding programmes. many public-sector national programmes cannot replicate the high volume crossing strategy of better-funded international breeding programmes. they can easily adopt the strategy of making fewer, more carefully chosen crosses to increase the efficiency of their breeding programmes and deliver more new varieties to their client farmers and thereby improve their food security. large international breeding programmes are inefficient in that the vast majority of crosses fail and would be more effective if fewer, better targeted crosses were made.
