BACKGROUND
from a statistical point of view, the inference of phylogenies is similar to the estimation of an unknown quantity in the presence of uncertainty. given the intrinsic uncertainty in solving phylogenetic relationships from limited  samples, it is necessary to assume that phylogenetic estimates are subject to stochastic and systematic errors  <cit> . consequently, the correct answer to a phylogenetic problem is not a single estimate – one topology optimal under the assumptions of a particular phylogenetic reconstruction method. rather, it is more appropriate to derive a set of phylogenies that capture the uncertainty about the solution to the phylogenetic reconstruction problem from the available data.

several statistical procedures have been proposed to test trees and to construct confidence sets of topologies derived from sequence data. these procedures include the bootstrap selection probability  of felsenstein  <cit> , and its modification  <cit> , the approximate unbiased  test, which reduces test bias and improves the accuracy and the simplicity of implementation. however, many concerns have been raised about the use of bp  <cit> . statistical tests of phylogenies based on maximum likelihood  include the kishino-hasegawa  test, which was later modified by shimodaira and hasegawa  to take into account test multiplicity, and the swofford-olsen-wadden-hillis  test. unfortunately, in some situations these tests give contradictory results  <cit> : the sh test seems to be too conservative, especially in comparison to the sowh test, which often rejects all but the maximum likelihood topology. strimmer and rambaut  <cit>  have argued that these discrepancies may be caused by model misspecification; however, the solution they proposed, the expected likelihood weights  test, shares with the sowh the inconvenience of being computationally intensive.

the generalized least squares  method for constructing confidence sets  <cit>  is closely related to least squares  tree building methods  <cit> , in which the goodness of fit of the distances measured on the tree  to the observed distances between taxa is the criterion used for selecting the best topology. these methods do not require expensive calculations, which make them applicable to the analysis of very large data sets. however, the use of the gls test for such data sets is often frustrated by the computational difficulties in calculating the covariance matrix and its inverse.

the gls test  <cit>  is based on the assumption that the evolutionary  distance between each particular pair of taxa takes a value drawn from a normal distribution centered on the patristic distance. under a null hypothesis that a given topology is true, the gls test statistic:

follows a chi-square distribution, provided the distances are  normal . in this formulation, dij are the evolutionary distances, eijare patristic distances , and wij, kl are entries in the inverted matrix of variances and covariances of the distances.

the problem of estimating the covariance matrix has been only recently solved by susko  <cit> . two methods for estimation of the variances and covariances were proposed: the sample average method and bootstrap estimation. only the former was implemented; still, the analysis of biological sequences showed that both give very close estimates  <cit> . both methods require access to sequence data. however, the advantage of distance methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, including those using the ls approach, over character-based methods is that the distances need not be derived from sequences, and even if they are, access to the character data is not necessary. in principle, ls methods could be used for such data as an alternative to bootstrapping  <cit>  and jackknifing methods  <cit> .

the calculation of the gls statistic requires inverting the covariance matrix, which is not always possible. a solution suggested by susko  <cit>  is to ignore the entries in the matrix that are close to zero, which results in a more conservative test. if the covariances are completely ignored, and only the values in the diagonal  are used, the sum gives a weighted least squares  statistic:

in this formulation, the distances are treated as independent to avoid computational difficulties. again, one can view this simplification as avoiding the division by numbers very close to zero, which results in a test statistic smaller than the corresponding gls statistic, and consequently fewer rejections .

although the phylogenetic distances are a priori not independent because taxa share evolutionary history, we have shown in a previous work that ignoring the covariances does not have drastic consequences for the reliability or the accuracy of the ls approach to interior branch testing in phylogenetic trees derived from sequences  <cit> .

in this work we investigate the applicability of ls methods for construction of confidence sets for topologies. we start by re-analyzing a well-known data set of six long sequences of mammalian mitochondrial proteins, for which the gls approach has been previously used. we then explore the size of the confidence sets obtained with the gls and wls methods using a database of nucleotide sequences. each data set in the database consisted of eight sequences chosen to minimize the effects of model misspecification. this was necessary since the existing implementation of the gls method allows its application only when simple models of nucleotide substitutions are used . we also present a simulation analysis in order to investigate both the size of confidence sets and the coverage of the ls methods. finally, we apply the wls method to two data sets for which the gls method could not be used:  a large number of short viral sequences in which testing alternative phylogenies is key in including or excluding patients from a nosocomial outbreak of hepatitis c, and  dna/dna hybridization data, where neither the gls method nor other methods of topology testing which require access to character data can be used.

the goal of this paper is to assess the applicability of the ls approach to construct confidence sets of trees from biological data. we will explore the consequences in terms of accuracy and reliability of the approximations inherent to both the gls and wls method.

RESULTS
mammalian mitochondrial protein sequences
we will first consider the mammalian mitochondrial protein data set originally analyzed by shimodaira and hasegawa  <cit> , and then by goldman, anderson and rodrigo  <cit> , shimodaira  <cit> , strimmer and rambaut  <cit> , and susko  <cit> . this data set consists of  <dig> aligned amino acids from six mammalian species: cow, harbor seal, human, mouse, opossum, and rabbit. we have used the generalized least squares test proposed by susko  <cit>  implemented in the glsprot program  <cit> , which uses the pam substitution model  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the comparison of the results obtained with gls and wls tests, and three tests based on likelihood , assuming the pam substitution model. all possible  <dig> unrooted topologies for six species were considered.

aminoacid sequences were taken from six mammalian species: homo sapiens , phoca vitulina , bos taurus  oryctolagus cuniculus , mus musculus , and didelphis virginiana . the tree believed to be the best estimate of mammalian phylogeny  <cit>  has been underlined. values in bold indicate the trees included in the  <dig>  confidence set: the trees with the highest confidence levels which add up to  <dig>  for the expected likelihood weights  test, and the trees with p-values above  <dig>  for one-tailed kishino-hasegawa  test, shimodaira-hasegawa  test, generalised least squares  test, and weighted least squares test .

the gls  <dig>  confidence set, as has been previously shown by susko  <cit>  for this data set, is formed by just five trees. as expected, the wls gives more conservative results, and includes two more topologies in the  <dig>  set. both the gls and wls  <dig>  confidence sets include all the trees containing the  cluster. the same  <dig> trees form the  <dig>  confidence set of the sh test, which for this data set is the most conservative. the sets of topologies accepted by elw and kh tests at the  <dig>  level include five and six trees, respectively.

with a more appropriate mtrev+g substitution model  <cit>  the sh, kh and elw methods gave similar results . the wls method put all  <dig> trees with the  cluster in the  <dig>  confidence set. it would be interesting to know how the gls results would be affected by using a different substitution model, but as was mentioned above, only the pam model has been implemented in the existing software  <cit> .

the size of ls confidence sets for nucleotide sequence data
the high computational efficiency of ls methods allows investigating the size of the confidence sets. for a small number of taxa, p-values can be obtained for all possible topologies. this becomes infeasible when the number of trees increases, but approximate confidence sets can be obtained by focusing on the trees with p-values above some threshold during the heuristic search. in order to evaluate and compare the sizes of the confidence sets obtained with the gls method and our computationally simpler approach, we have constructed a database of eight-species data sets of nucleotide sequences obtained from embl-align  <cit> . gaps and positions of doubtful homology in the multiple alignments were removed using gblocks  <cit> ; only alignments longer than  <dig> nucleotides were kept:  <dig> out of  <dig> in the embl-align database.

finding the data sets for which the gls statistic could be calculated proved to be a very difficult task. we iteratively constructed eight-taxon subsets of each data set in the embl-align database until we found a subset for which the gls statistic could be calculated. for many data sets, such a subset could be found only after several thousands of subsets were considered. even so, it was necessary to use the glsdna_eig routine, which approximates the gls calculations when the covariance matrix has small eigenvalues  <cit> .

the felsenstein <dig>  <cit>  substitution model is the most complex model in the available implementation of the gls method  <cit> . to avoid the problem of using an inappropriate substitution model, we considered only the data sets for which the akaike information criterion difference from the model with the minimum aic was less than  <dig> for the f <dig> model. the aic difference was calculated using modeltest  <cit> .

the sequences taken from each alignment are listed in the second column. Δaic values for the felsenstein <dig> nucleotide substitution model were calculated using paup* and modeltest. the percentage of four-taxon subset for which the star topology was the ml solution  was calculated using treepuzzle. the last four columns show number of trees out of possible  <dig> included in the  <dig>  confidence set using: expected likelihood weights  test, shimodaira-hasegawa  test, generalised least squares  test, and weighted least squares test .

in general, we have observed that various methods gave expected results  when there was a large number of site patterns in the alignment , even when the percent of unresolved quartets was quite high . however, it is not clear why for some data sets wls gave a much more smaller confidence set than gls, as can be observed for the data set  <dig>  which is quite similar to  <dig>  or data set  <dig>  which is similar to  <dig> . when the number of site patterns was very low  and the number of unresolved quartets extremely high , all tests gave similar results. it appears that larger confidence set for gls than for wls were observed especially when the number of patterns was low  but the high percentage of resolved quartets indicated good phylogenetic signal . on the other hand, both ls methods gave similar results when the phylogenetic signal was worse , with the exception of data set  <dig> 

the analysis of eight-species data sets discussed above shows the limitations of the gls approach when the covariance matrix is close to singular. indeed, both in simulations  and for biological sequences obtained from the embl-align database we observed that in many cases the calculation of the gls statistic was not possible due to the singularity of the distance matrix. this was especially pronounced when the sequences were relatively short.

the coverage of ls tree testing methods in simulations
recent results of shi et al.  <cit>  indicated a strange behavior of the gls test when the number of taxa increased in simulations. in this previous study  <cit> , sequences were simulated over three ml topologies constructed from a 10-, 15- and 20-taxon subsets of a published 66-taxon tree of placental mammals  <cit> . shi et al. observed that for the high number of taxa, although the number of trees included in the gls confidence set increased, the method undercovered. the observed coverage of the 20-taxon tree was only  <dig>  for 95% confidence set  <cit> , lower than the lower bound for the nominal coverage, that is, the frequency in which the confidence set includes the true tree /100

in an effort to reproduce this simulation study, we have used the same tree topologies , and the same parameters for hky substitution model  to simulate 3000-nt sequences with evolver . to get the measure of the size of confidence set, for each simulated data set we have tested  <dig> trees chosen from the trees with the highest likelihood found by a heuristic search with the nearest-neighbor interchange using paup*  <cit> . the largest difference in log likelihood among those trees was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for 10-, 15- and 20-taxon trees, respectively. in other words, we have chosen  <dig> trees from a larger spectrum of best trees  then just the best  <dig> trees found in the heuristic search as in the previous study  <cit>  .

the table shows the average number of trees  in the 95% confidence sets of gls, wls, sh and elw out of  <dig> trees constructed for simulated 10-, 15- and 20-taxon sequences and the coverage of this confidence sets for gls and wls .

large data set of hepatitis c virus sequences
the next data set we considered consisted of  <dig> short  sequences obtained from  <dig> patients involved in the analysis of a hepatitis c virus  outbreak. this data set could not be analyzed with the existing implementations of the gls procedure, even using the glsdna_eig routine.

the sequences correspond to the e1–e <dig> region of the viral genome, which includes the hypervariable region  <dig> and codes for surface proteins. out of  <dig> sequences under analysis,  <dig> were derived from  <dig> patients presumably involved in the outbreak, eight were from local controls unrelated to the outbreak, and ten sequences were obtained from external controls from different geographical origins. the tvm+Γ+i model  was used to calculate ml distances and branch lengths using paup*  <cit>  and tree-puzzle  <cit> . this model was found to be optimal according to the akaike information criterion  <cit>  using modeltest  <dig>   <cit> .

the test set consisted of  <dig> trees: the maximum likelihood tree and  <dig> trees in which the clone sequences of each single local patient in the analysis were forced to form a monophyletic clade with geographically unrelated sequences not belonging to the outbreak. following an analogous reasoning to  <cit>  and  <cit> , if such tree is included in the confidence set, then the patient can be excluded from the outbreak, and vice versa: if this tree is excluded, then the patient can be assigned to the outbreak. table  <dig> shows which trees were included in the confidence sets using the wls method and the elw, kh, and sh tests.

the data set consisted of  <dig> sequences corresponding to the e1–e <dig> region of the viral genome taken from  <dig> patients plus  <dig> local control  sequences of the same genotype  taken from individuals unrelated to the outbreak. the results from a more detailed analysis with an expanded data set were used to separate the  <dig> patients into four groups: eo, excluded from the outbreak; o <dig>  involved in the outbreak, transmission chain 1; o <dig>  involved in transmission chain 2; and o <dig>  involved in transmission chain  <dig>  the test set consisted of  <dig> trees, the ml tree and  <dig> trees in which the sequences from each patient where moved to form a monophyletic group with the external controls. for each alternative topology the probability associated to the corresponding test statistic  is shown. topologies included in the confidence set around the ml tree at the  <dig>  level  are indicated. for wls, the value of the corresponding statistic is shown between parentheses.

as a reference we have used the results obtained in a more detailed analysis  of an expanded data set derived from the same patients, which included clone sequences from the same e1–e <dig> region and direct sequences from the ns5b genomic region. this analysis indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> patients belonged to the outbreak and allowed to identify three independent transmission events, one involving  <dig> patients, and two smaller transmission chains, with  <dig> and  <dig> patients, respectively. using these results as a standard, all tests correctly identified the isolates belonging to the 13-patient transmission chain , because in all cases the modified tree was excluded from the confidence set of trees. out of the  <dig> additional isolates also belonging to the outbreak according to the reference analysis , two  were identified by all tests as belonging to the outbreak, one  was excluded from the outbreak by sh and wls tests, while the remaining two patient isolates  were excluded from the outbreak only by the wls test. on the other hand, the elw and kh tests both assigned to the outbreak several local control patients and also patients which were judged external by the reference analysis . this suggests that although the elw and kh are more powerful, their results are less reliable since they erroneously include in the outbreak patients which do not belong to it according to other evidence.

we note that wls shows p-values close either to zero or one, which at first may be striking. the explanation is quite simple. the number of branch lengths grows linearly with the number of species in a bifurcating tree, and the number of distances is quadratic with the number of species, and so is the number of degrees of freedom of the chi-square distribution. the consequences can be observed in fig.  <dig>  which shows the shape of the chi-square distribution for  <dig> degrees of freedom and makes clear that the values very close to zero or one would be observed for any ls test procedure.

dna/dna hybridization data
the advantage of ls methods for tree reconstruction is not only their high computational efficiency but also that the data need not to be characters: distances that are not derived directly from sequences can also be used for tree reconstruction. also, occasionally access to the original character data derived from sequences is not possible; only distance methods can be used in such conditions. the wls method of topology testing could also be used for such data provided that the variances are known or can be estimated. one example of such data is dna/dna hybridization data.

the data set we will use here as an example was originally obtained by marshall and swift  <cit>  using four species of sand dollars: dendraster excentricus  , echinarachnius parma  , leodia sexiesperforata  , and mellita spp. , with sea biscuit clypeaster rosaceus   as outgroup. this is a high quality data set of dna/dna hybridization data; although the normalized percent hybridization  values were all below 50%, the values were highly reproducible  <cit> , and the data reported in the original paper included the variances for two distances measures: 1/nph , and Δtm , corrected for multiple substitutions using the jukes-cantor  <cit>  formula. all  <dig> possible five-species trees were considered using the wls test; fig.  <dig> shows the results, compared with the bootstrap  <cit> . both methods rejected  <dig> topologies that were not shown in the figure. for the 1/nph distances, only one tree belongs to the wls  <dig>  confidence set, the bootstrap confidence set included one additional topology. both methods gave similar results also for the Δtm data: three  or two  topologies. the quality of the regression used to calculate the two parameters necessary for the calculation of the wls statistic was not as good as is routinely observed for sequence data : r <dig> was  <dig>  for the 1/nph data, but only  <dig>  for the Δtm data. however, when the whole variance matrix was used in the calculations , the sizes of wls  <dig>  confidence sets did not change .

discussion
distance methods for tree inference have the advantage that they can be used when the distances are not derived from characters or when there is no access to the original sequence data. when the data are sequences, using the distance matrix unavoidably results in some loss of information. this leads to reduced statistical power compared to character-based methods such as maximum likelihood or bayesian methods of tree reconstruction, the advantage being a much higher computational efficiency, an important issue for very large data sets. contrary to maximum parsimony, distance methods have been shown to be consistent, and they usually are as accurate as maximum likelihood methods  <cit> . in particular, the least squares  criterion is well-established both for phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit>  and hypothesis testing  <cit> . simulation studies  <cit>  have shown that the wls method is accurate and consistent for tree inference.

both gls and wls are based on the assumption that distances are normally distributed. although it has been traditionally considered that this assumption is not fulfilled for distances derived from nucleotide or amino acid sequences  <cit> , more recent work  <cit>  showed that provided the distances are maximum likelihood estimates, their distribution is approximately multivariate normal, which led to the proposal of a gls test for topologies. the ls method is applicable to distance measures not necessarily derived from sequence data, but whenever it is reasonable to assume normality of the distances. what makes the wls test different from the gls is that distances are considered independent for computational reasons. although the phylogenetic distances are not independent because taxa share common evolutionary history, our previous results suggest that this does not affect the performance of the wls method for branch testing  <cit> .

in this work we have investigated the applicability of ls methods for topology testing and the consequences of using the wls approximation. to compare our method to previously proposed procedures, we first restrict the discussion to examples in which the distances were derived from sequences and the variances estimated by bootstrapping. however, the wls method is applicable for testing topological hypotheses and for finding confidence sets of trees as long as the distance matrices and at least some of the variances associated with the distances are known. the distances may, for example, be derived from dna-dna hybridization assays, or result from averaging different data sets.

the first data set we considered, that of mammalian mitochondrial proteins, has gained a de facto benchmarking status, and has been discussed in a number of previous studies  <cit> . in these studies, restricting the number of topologies supported by the data was at least implicitly considered desirable. taking into account that various methods give different answers and that the topology believed to be the best estimate  <cit>  is not included in the  <dig>  confidence set by the elw and kh tests, it might be argued that this is not necessarily so. this topology was not included neither in the confidence sets obtained with sowh nor the approximate unbiased test  <cit> . however, erroneous rejections in the analyses of real data may be caused by bias, not only because the confidence sets are too radical. although conservative confidence sets may be useful in face of unrecognized biases , it is hard to investigate the effects of biased estimates on the performance of various methods.

one way around this problem is to investigate the performance of the methods using simulated data. in the case of our simulations, the number of possible sources of bias was diminished . the disadvantage is, of course, that the method that performs best in simulations may not necessarily work well in real data analysis. therefore, we first investigated the size of confidence sets for topologies obtained with real data: eight-taxon nucleotide data sets from the embl-align database. the results were somewhat surprising. the wls confidence sets were always smaller than the sh sets and, what is more surprising, in the majority of cases smaller than the confidence sets obtained using the gls method. perhaps numerical errors or errors in the gls implementation may account for these rather unexpected outcomes, although it appears that such discrepancies may occur principally when the number of site patterns in the sequence alignment is low. for simulated data, strange behavior of the gls method has been previously reported  <cit> : the true tree was included in the confidence set rarer than expected, especially as the number of taxa in the trees increased. this behavior was observed even though the number of trees included in the confidence set grew larger with the increase of the number of taxa for the topology used in the simulations . in the same simulations, wls always included the true tree in the confidence set, which is an expected conservative behavior considering on the one hand the construction of the test and on the other the topology of the trees.

when the number of taxa is very large, the fact that p-values are being indistinguishable either from zero or from one may at first look striking. this problem is not a result of the computational differences between wls and gls, but rather the shape of the chi-square density distribution . therefore, the gls method would also result in extreme p-values, if it could be applied to the hcv data set, for which the covariance matrix was very close to singular due to the presence of very closely related sequences.

the covariance matrix may be non-invertible for two reasons: the variance of one or more distances is practically zero or the correlations between the distances are  perfect. both conditions are related and occur when the data set includes very closely related taxa: small distances would have very small variances, and the distances between these taxa and the other otus would be highly correlated . in fact, both conditions also affect the wls statistic; in the first case, this is caused by division by values very close to zero . however, the results obtained with wls for the hcv data set were reasonable. this might be due to an over-estimation of small variances. since in theory the true variances should be used, the wls statistic would be smaller  and the test more conservative. indeed, in the hcv-1b e1–e <dig> example the wls test gave more conservative estimation of the tree confidence set than the sh test. however, the comparison with the results obtained from an independent analysis indicates that these results were reliable.

a result which might strike as paradoxical is the rejection of all the possible topologies by ls methods, rarely observed for short sequences, but unavoidable for very long sequences, both real and simulated . this may occur because a particular data set indeed cannot be fitted to a tree . however, as the number of characters increases, the variance decreases, leading to the rejection of all the hypotheses. indeed, it is well known that p-values are dependent on sample size  <cit> , and that one can always reject a null hypothesis with a large enough sample, even if the true difference is trivial .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have explored the limitations of ls methods for phylogeny testing. the advantage of these methods is their high computational efficiency, which allows their application to very large data sets. we have proposed a way to approximate the value of the test statistic  which requires only a matrix of distances and at least some of the variances. in principle, this allows the application of the method for data sets in which the distances are not derived directly from sequences . we have shown the applicability of the method to such data , but only by considering sequence data we have been able to compare the results of the wls method to other methods for construction of tree confidence sets, including the gls method. we believe that none of these methods is free from limitations, and the fact that in practical applications various tests give contradictory results has been noticed previously  <cit> . this results in an uncomfortable situation because it is not very difficult to simulate data in such a way that they show the superiority of a particular test over others and, in which by choosing either a 'more conservative' or 'less conservative' test, one can accept or reject a particular topological hypothesis.

the results obtained with the wls method we present are reasonable in the sense that they are similar to the results obtained with other tests. this cannot be said of the available implementation of the gls method: firstly, for many real data sets the test statistic cannot be calculated. it is difficult to say if the second problem  is or not caused by errors in the implementation. the wls method we propose is computationally very efficient and is not restricted to a particular substitution model. it may be useful to assess the phylogenetic signal in the data, and to screen out the hypotheses which are likely to be rejected by more powerful tests or when few alternatives are available .
