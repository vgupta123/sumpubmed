BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  is the known cause of johne's disease of wild and domestic ruminants, in particular dairy cattle  <cit> . although cattle are usually infected with map during the first six months of life, via the faecal oral route, clinical signs, such as diarrhoea, emaciation and dehydration, usually develop only after a 3– <dig> year incubation period  <cit> . despite the importance of johne's disease, both from an animal welfare and agro-economic perspective, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the entry and survival of map in the host are only poorly characterised  <cit> . however, it is now generally accepted that the persistence of map in host macrophages is crucial to the establishment and progression of the disease  <cit> .

in addition to its clear veterinary importance map may have a more direct human impact in that it has been implicated as a cause of crohn's disease in humans  <cit> . crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that commonly affects the terminal ileum but can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. at present there is no recognised cure but sufferers can experience periods of remission. however, the overall quality of life of the sufferer and their immediate family is low  <cit> . although a role, if any, for map as a contributory factor in crohn's disease is not proven, the evidence was sufficient for the uk government to advocate a precautionary approach and to attempt to minimise exposure of the public to this organism  <cit> .

map is known to survive for protracted periods in the environment  <cit> , although it is generally considered unable to replicate because of its requirement for mycobactin, an iron-chelating compound, required for replication of the organism outside its natural host. one of the strategies adopted by map that contributes to its longevity in the environment may be its ability to survive ingestion by protozoa, which are usually bacteriovores . indeed it has been reported that this allows m. avium to acquire a phenotype more pathogenic to humans  <cit> . legionella pneumophila, a known human pathogen, shares the same characteristic except that it is able to multiply within its protozoan host  <cit> . there is a paucity of published information on the interaction of map and free-living protozoa that may allow viable intervention strategies to be devised. there is also a lack of information on the protection such an intracellular location might afford against bacteriocidal agents such as chlorine that are used in water treatment operations and food plant cleaning processes.

the work reported here had three objectives: to investigate the uptake of map by two commonly occurring environmental protozoa, acanthamoeba castellanii and a. polyphaga; to determine the survival ability of map when ingested by the two protozoa, and to compare the chlorine resistance of ingested and free-living map.

RESULTS
ingestion of map by acanthamoeba spp
both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to assess if ingestion of three map strains by the two acanthamoeba spp. occurred. intracellularly located map were initially visualised by acid-fast staining of aliquots of co-culture after  <dig> min; acid-fast map cells staining red and subcellular structures of the amoeba staining blue. microscopy revealed that numerous map cells were present within vacuoles within the amoebae . figure 1b shows an amoeba cell lysed by sonication in the presence of 1% tween  <dig> releasing the ingested map cells. enumeration of the map cells ingested by the two acanthamoeba spp. revealed that between  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % of the initial spiked map populations were taken up by a. castellanii and a. polyphaga, respectively, with only minor differences between the three map strains studied.

survival of map within acanthamoeba spp. for extended periods
when map nctc  <dig> was incubated at 25°c in co-culture with either a. castellanii or a. polyphaga for a longer period , the intracellular map counts did not alter significantly within either acanthamoeba sp. during the first  <dig> days of incubation . however, between  <dig> and  <dig> days incubation there was a significant 1– <dig>  log <dig> increase in numbers of intracellular map . co-culture was not followed beyond  <dig> d.

comparative chlorine resistance of free and internalised map
a significant difference in the chlorine resistance of map harboured within protozoa  and free map was observed at all chlorine concentrations and contact times . ingested map was found to be more resistant to chlorination than free map overall. the greatest reduction in numbers of ingested map achieved by exposure to the highest chlorine concentration  for the longest contact time  was  <dig>  log <dig> reductions, whereas under the same conditions a reduction of  <dig>  log <dig> was achieved for free map . overall, chlorine concentration was found to have a significant effect on inactivation of map , irrespective of whether they were intracellularly located or free, whereas chlorine contact time did not have a significant effect on map inactivation .

discussion
this study has demonstrated that map is not only able to survive ingestion by a. castellanii and a. polyphaga, but that the intracellular location appears to provide an environment where multiplication of map can occur and protection from the effects of chlorine is afforded. our findings in relation to ingestion capability and trends in survival of map within amoeba following ingestion are similar to those reported recently by mura et al.  <cit>  for the interaction of bovine and human strains of map with a. polyphaga. mura et al.  <cit>  enumerated the number of map cells in harvested amoebae by quantitative real-time pcr and reported that between  <dig>  and 11% of spiked map populations were ingested by a. polyphaga. in the present study the number of map within harvested amoebae was quantified by using a published formula  <cit>  which relates bactec growth index readings and detection time to numbers of viable map present, yet the ingestion figures obtained were within the same range as mura et al.  <cit>  at between  <dig>  and  <dig> % for both acanthamoeba spp. mura et al.  <cit>  suggested that perhaps amoebae may only be able to take the mycobacteria up as single organisms and not as clumps. figure  <dig> shows many map cells concentrated within the vacuole of a. castellanii after  <dig> hours in co-culture at 25°c. unfortunately, whether these were taken up as individual cells or as clumps of cells cannot be determined. interestingly, auramine-rhodamine stained smears of  <dig> month old co-cultures of a. polyphaga fed with extracts of human crohn's disease tissue examined by mura et al.  <cit>  revealed map present throughout the cytoplasm of the amoeba  or where the amoebae had undergone encystment map were peripherally located.

in this study map clearly demonstrated an ability to survive ingestion by both acanthamoeba spp., and an increase in map numbers occurred after an initial 'lag' period of around  <dig> d when co-culture was followed for a period of  <dig> d . this is also in accord with the findings of mura et al.  <cit>  who observed a similar length 'lag' period  before multiplication  of map within a. polyphaga between  <dig> and  <dig> days. since map is a very slow-growing bacterium it is perhaps not surprising that it required an extended period of adaptation to its new intracellular environment before replication commenced. what is unexpected, however, is how map multiplied at all in the absence of adventitious mycobactin. replication of the closely-related m. avium following phagocytosis by a. castellanii at temperatures as low as 24°c has previously been reported  <cit> , so it is not unexpected that map behaves in a similar fashion to m. avium and, indeed, other mycobacteria studied previously  <cit> . the observation of the persistence of both m. avium and map in the outer walls of the double-walled cysts of a. polyphaga  <cit>  indicates that map can also survive encystment which would further prolong its survival in extreme environmental conditions. the above studies provide clear evidence of interaction between map and protozoa at ambient laboratory temperatures . numerous invertebrate and protozoal species have been shown to be present in surface water in australia  <cit>  so there is certainly scope for such interaction to take place. however, further research will be required to confirm whether interaction occurs between map and protozoa at lower temperatures that may be more representative of natural environmental conditions, certainly in temperate climates.

the bactericidal effect of chlorine on free map in water was studied previously in our laboratory  <cit> . log <dig> reductions in the range  <dig> – <dig>  were observed for map strains nctc  <dig>  and atcc  <dig>  during that study when the same chlorine concentrations and contact times were employed as in the present study. log <dig> reductions observed for free map nctc  <dig> during the present study fell broadly within the same range . log <dig> reductions achieved with ingested map were much lower  indicating enhanced chlorine resistance when map was taken up by a. polyphaga. the elevated chlorine resistance of ingested map is perhaps not unexpected, given that this has previously been observed for coliforms and other bacterial pathogens within protozoa  <cit> . enhanced resistance of map to other chemical stressors when taken up by amoebae is also a possibility given that co-culture of m. avium with a. castellanii reduced the effectiveness of the antimicrobials rifabutin, azithromycin and clarithromycin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the demonstrated ability of map to survive ingestion by acanthamoeba spp. in the laboratory situation and subsequently multiply clearly illustrates a potential survival and dissemination strategy for this animal pathogen, which may also potentially be implicated in human disease, to use in the natural environment. the enhanced chlorine resistance when ingested by protozoa has clear implications with regard to ensuring the efficacy of chlorination processes during water treatment in order to minimise exposure of the public to this potential pathogen.
