BACKGROUND
odonata display large inter- and intra-specific colour variation and have some of the most advanced visual systems among insects  <cit> . with their large and complex eyes, aquatic and terrestrial life stages  <cit> , carnivorous lifestyle  <cit> , exceptional mating behaviours  <cit> , diversity in coloration  <cit> , and occupancy of diverse light environments, odonates are ideal model organisms to study the evolution of colour and vision pathways and functions. however, odonate colour and visual systems are little understood  <cit> . lack of genomic and transcriptomic sequence information limits molecular investigation on this group. so far only one draft genome  and one transcriptome assembly  <cit>  have been published for odonates. an improved understanding of the molecular basis of phenotypic adaptations in odonata would allow investigations of genomic divergence associated with ecological shifts in light environments, and inter- and intra-specific divergence in color vision. several distinctive traits of the blue-tailed damselfly ischnura elegans  make this species a useful model for studying genome evolution and development. ischnura elegans has developed into a model organism in evolutionary ecology because of its female limited colour polymorphism, which affects mate choice and sexual conflict interactions. males of i. elegans are monomorphic in colour, but females of this species fall into one of three distinct phenotypically visible colour morphs, namely the male mimicking androchrome morph, and the more cryptic infuscans and infuscans-obsoleta morph  <cit> . the prevalence of female colour polymorphism in this species is thought to result from sexual conflict over optimal mating rates, where females might benefit from lower mating rates than males, and where pre-copulatory male mating harassment is common  <cit> . this sexual conflict leads to extensive mating harassment and negative frequency-dependent selection, because the males form search images for the common morphs, similar to the apostatic survival selection on common prey caused by predators  <cit> . this species has also been studied with respect to sperm competition  <cit> , morph dependent mating rates  <cit> , and the evolution of reproductive barriers  <cit> . ischnura elegans belongs to the largest damselfly family coenagrionidae, which includes  <dig> genera and  <dig> species worldwide  <cit> . over  <dig> species are colour polymorphic  <cit> , and evidence from crossing experiments in several species suggests a genetic basis to colour  <cit> . in the female-polymorphic genus ischnura, even closely related taxa often differ in the presence and absence of female polymorphism and/or in the spectral ability to differentiate colour  <cit> . identifying the genetic changes underlying the colour polymorphism on an intra- and inter-specific level would increase our understanding of the macroevolutionary dynamics of this polymorphism. ischnura elegans is a widespread damselfly species all over europe  <cit>  and can commonly be found in disturbed environments, such as human-made artificial ponds  <cit> . unlike many other odonate species, i. elegans tolerates most plants as perching substrate  <cit> .

here we present a de novo transcriptome assembly for the blue-tailed damselfly i. elegans to investigate the nuclear, protein-encoding gene profile of this species and to give functional annotation to the proteins expressed. the transcriptome of the head, thorax and abdomen are compared to each other, and to the transcriptome of the dragonfly ladona fulva    <cit> , the damselfly enallagma hageni    <cit>  and the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster    <cit> . furthermore, we aim to generate a sensory toolkit for the genes underlying colour recognition , female polychromatism and body colour patterns .

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing
illumina sequencing of one i. elegans individual yielded a total of  <dig> gb of mrna sequence equivalents consisting of  <dig> , <dig> paired-ends  <dig> bp reads . the average read length for each of the three tissues was  <dig> bp, yielding complete datasets of  <dig>  gb for the head,  <dig>  gb thorax and  <dig>  gb for the abdomen. quality parameters of the three tissues types  were 91%, 92%, 92% for q <dig>  and 42%, 38%, and 43% for the gc percentage, respectively, while the percentage of unknown base calls  was  <dig> % for both the head and thorax and  <dig> % for the abdomen.

high quality data  were obtained by removing reads containing adapter sequences, short reads and low quality reads from raw sequence data, reducing the three sequence sets to approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> million reads for the head, thorax and abdomen, respectively. subsequently, the trimmed reads from the head, thorax and abdomen had a mean read length of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, and the q <dig> percentage was 100% for all three tissues. for detail summary of the trimming step statistics refer to table  <dig>  all the subsequent analyses were carried out using  <dig> , <dig> high quality trimmed reads.table  <dig>

de novotranscriptome assembly, quality filtering and assessment
the transcriptome was assembled de novo with trinity  <cit>  using all trimmed reads and yielded a total of  <dig>  contigs with a minimum length of  <dig> bp, a n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp and an average contig length of  <dig>  bp. in the absence of a reference genome it is difficult to assess the quality of the assembled transcripts. however, to identify poor quality and potentially mis-assembled transcripts, the reads were mapped back to the assembly and the alignment visualized with igv v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

to improve the overall quality of the assembled transcriptome, a three-step quality filtering method was employed . first, sequence redundancy was removed by clustering the duplicates using cdhit-est at 95% sequence similarity  <cit> . this step clustered  <dig> % of the transcripts together, leaving  <dig>  transcripts. second, the transcript read coverage at each base was calculated using bed tools. transcripts that had a mean coverage per base of less than  <dig> were removed, filtering  <dig>  transcripts, and leaving  <dig>  high quality transcripts. third, repeatmasker  <cit>  identified  <dig>  repetitive elements,  <dig> rna  and  <dig>  low complexity regions in the transcriptome . from this,  <dig> ribosomal rna sequences were identified in  <dig> transcripts  and these were removed from the assembly. the filtering step not only reduced the redundancy but also filtered the shorter sequences . comparative assembly statistics before and after filtering are reported in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the final dataset contained  <dig>  high quality transcripts with an n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp and a mean length of  <dig>  bp, which was used for all subsequent analyses. a detailed summary of the final assembly statistics can be found in table  <dig> table  <dig> 
summary statistics of final assembly




after quality filtering, the assembly was further validated for sequence completeness. cegma  <cit>  identified  <dig> out of  <dig> ultra-conserved core proteins as ‘complete’ in the transcriptome assembly, yielding a completeness of  <dig> %. the remaining gene was identified as a ‘partial’ gene. targetidentifier  <cit>  identified  <dig>  transcripts with a blastx hit, of which  <dig>  transcripts  could be assembled to their full length. of these transcripts,  <dig>  were identified as full-length,  <dig>  as short full-length,  <dig> as ambiguous,  <dig>  as 5′-sequenced partial and  <dig>  as 3′-sequenced partial. the full-length information was generated only for the transcripts that yielded a blastx hit. further, the assembly was investigated for the ability to yield protein-coding sequences. transdecoder reported  <dig>  orfs in  <dig>   transcripts. the assembly sequence completeness and protein-yielding capability was high, and hence the assembly was used for further analysis.

transcript annotation
the transcript annotation with blastx  <cit>  using the ncbi non-redundant  protein database gave a match for  <dig>   transcripts, while  <dig>  transcripts could not be matched with blastx using a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  the species representing the top blast hits are shown in figure 1a. of these, tribolium castaneum  yielded the highest number of top hits, followed by pediculus humanus  and megachile rotundata . all three orders belong to the neoptera reviewed in  <cit> , which is considered the closest relative to the odonata . of the three orders, the phthiraptera are taxonomically closest to the odonata, followed by the hymenoptera and then the coleoptera  <cit> , which was not reflected in our blastx homology search. the small genome size of phthiraptera and its high evolutionary rate , likely due to the parasitic lifestyle, possibly partly explains the lower number of hits in comparison to coleoptera. moreover, all the three orders diverged from odonates a long time ago and during a relatively small time window, making a distinction between them difficult. lastly, the homology results will likely be biased by the amount and quality of available species-specific data that has been deposited in the databases. closely related species with genomic resources were compared to the i. elegans transcriptome by mapping our data to the transcriptome of the dragonfly species ladona fulva , the damselfly species enallagma hageni  and the fruit fly model drosophila melanogaster .figure  <dig>

the blast2gointerproscan annotation resulted in  <dig>  transcripts  with at least one interproscan annotation. a list of the  <dig> most abundant interpro domain hits is reported in the figure 1b, showing ipr <dig>  to be the most prevalent domain present in  <dig> transcripts, followed by ipr <dig>  and ipr <dig> . the assembled transcripts were also annotated with gene ontology  into three major go categories: biological processes, cell component, and molecular function. a total of  <dig>   transcripts were associated with at least one go term:  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to the biological processes,  <dig>  to the molecular function and  <dig>  to cell components . in the biological process category, the majority of transcripts were involved in cellular protein metabolic processes  and signal transduction processes . a large fraction of transcripts in the molecular function category is involved in dna binding  and rna binding  functions, whereas the cellular component category is predominated by transcripts involved in intracellular organelle  and cytoplasm  processes.

blastx was able to annotate  <dig> % and interproscan  <dig> % of the transcripts. considering both the blastx and interproscan results, a total of  <dig>   de novo assembled transcripts could be annotated. of the total number of annotated transcripts,  <dig>  transcripts were well annotated , obtained from union of blastx and interproscan annotated transcripts, detailed in figure 1c.

rna-sequence mapping on the d. melanogasterand i. eleganstranscriptome
almost all i. elegans trimmed sequence reads  failed to map to the d. melanogaster transcriptome, which consists of  <dig>  transcripts  <cit> . of the  <dig> , <dig> reads  that mapped to the d. melanogaster transcriptome,  <dig>  reads  were paired, whereas  <dig> , <dig> reads  mapped as singletons. only  <dig>   of the d. melanogaster transcripts showed expression in i. elegans .

rna-seq reads from the dragonfly l. fulva
 <cit>  and the damselfly e. hageni
 <cit>  were mapped to the i. elegans transcriptome. the majority of reads  from the l. fulva could not be mapped to the i. elegans transcriptome. among the  <dig> , <dig> l. fulva reads that mapped to the i. elegans transcriptome,  <dig> , <dig>  mapped as singletons and  <dig> , <dig>  reads as pairs, generating an overall mapping percentage of  <dig> %. mapping of e. hageni single-end reads to the i. elegans transcriptome resulted in  <dig>   reads that could not be mapped and  <dig>   of reads mapped. summary statistics of rna-seq reads for l. fulva and e. hageni mapping to the i. elegans transcriptome are reported in table  <dig>  more e. hageni  transcripts were found in i. elegans compared to l. fulva . of these,  <dig>   transcripts were expressed in both the species . they are presumably expressed in all three species, but homology is too low to detect most of them. a list of the  <dig> most expressed genes from both species is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig>

interspecific transcript level comparisons showed that e. hageni shared most transcripts  with i. elegans, followed by l. fulva  and d. melanogaster , which closely corresponds to the taxonomic distance between these species  <cit> . a large fraction of these common transcripts encodes for proteins that are involved in maintaining structure and function of muscles and the transfer of electrons in the electron transport chain in mitochondria.

abundance estimation and differential expression of transcripts in the three tissue types
rna-seq mapping was performed with rsem  <cit>  to calculate expression levels of the assembled transcripts for the three tissue types. mapping results showed that  <dig> , <dig>  paired reads from the head,  <dig> , <dig>  from the thorax and  <dig> , <dig>  from the abdomen mapped to the assembled transcript, resulting in more than 15% reads that could not be mapped to the final set of assembled transcripts. the rna-seq mapping analysis revealed that more transcripts were expressed in the abdomen tissue than in the other two tissue types. the total number of transcripts expressed was  <dig>   in the head,  <dig>   in the thorax and  <dig>   in the abdomen, respectively. comparative analyses among all the three tissues revealed that  <dig>   transcripts were expressed in all tissues, while  <dig>   of the transcripts were mutually expressed in the head and thorax,  <dig>   in the head and abdomen and lastly  <dig>   transcripts in the abdomen and thorax .figure  <dig> 
summary of transcriptome expression analysis. a) overlap of the head, thorax and abdomen transcriptome. the abdomen transcriptome is larger than the two other tissue types, with  <dig>  transcripts detected in the abdomen ,  <dig>  in the head  and  <dig>  in the thorax . b) heatmap of rna abundance expression. abundance expression was determined using rsem and abdundance was measured using fpkm . the figure depicts the  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes from the head, thorax and abdomen, supporting data is given in the additional file 1: tables s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  the left side of the figure represents the gene name, while the right side describes the general function of the gene.



a list of the  <dig> most expressed genes in the head, thorax and abdomen, respectively is reported in figure 2b . of the top  <dig> genes expressed in i. elegans tissues, the largest fraction was made up of proteins that act as components in the respiratory chain of mitochondria facilitating electron transfer  and muscle proteins . a hypothetical protein that showed highest expression in all the three tissue is an immune-related gene, which regulates immune signalling in insects  <cit> . noteworthy, high expression of protein coding gene takeout  was observed in head. this protein participates in a novel circadian output pathway and is also involved in male courtship behaviour in d. melanogaster.

a total of  <dig>  transcripts were differentially expressed in the head , thorax  and abdomen  using a p-value cut-off for fdr 1e- <dig> and a fold change of  <dig>  however without biological replicates, any conclusions about gene expression data can be weak. a list of the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes in the head, thorax and abdomen, respectively, are reported in figure 3a-c . the results clearly showed that the most differentially expressed genes in the head were opsins , genes that participate in light-induced cascades , and neuropeptide-like precursors that influence behaviour, development, immunity and physiological processes. the thorax showed elevated expression of genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. the differentially expressed genes of the abdomen included major allergen bla, which is an allergen that is responsible for respiratory disorders like asthma  <cit> , brain chitinase and chia, chitinase, chitin-binding protein, all these have chitin-binding domain and form peritrophic matrix proteins of insects, venom protein r-like, which is a toxin and hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein, which regulates embryogenesis, larva development and stimulates reproductive maturation.figure  <dig>

a go term enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes from the head, thorax and abdomen using gossip  <cit>  fishers exact test with blast2go. a total of  <dig> enriched go terms were identified in the head, which were subsequently reduced to  <dig> most specific terms. the most specific go terms in the head included signal transduction  and responses to abiotic stimuli  under the biological processes category, plasma membrane  and cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicles  under the cell component category and receptor activity  and ion channel activity  under the molecular function category. only three enriched go terms were observed in the thorax, which included the generation of precursor metabolites and energy  under the biological processes category, mitochondrion  under cell component category and electron transport activity  under molecular function category. a total of  <dig> enriched go terms were observed in the abdomen, of which  <dig> were reduced to the most specific go terms. among these, the most enriched go terms were catabolic processes  and translation  under the biological processes category, ribosome  and cytoskeleton  functions under the cell component category and structural molecular activity  and peptidase activity  under the molecular function category .

the consistent findings from the abundance estimation and differential expression analysis underscore the specific roles that these three tissue types play in i. elegans: the head seems to regulate not only light receptivity and vision but also other sensory processes and transmits information via electrical and chemical signals to other body parts, response to abiotic stimulus and also contain protein that can regulate male courtship behaviour; the thorax with its flight musculature has a large number of mitochondria and muscle proteins and the abdomen not only performs translation and catabolic processes but also contains some defence proteins, such as allergens and toxins.

opsin and pigment pathways
the odonate eye can detect colour from the ultraviolet   to the long wavelength   portion of the visible spectrum and is capable of discriminating polarized light  <cit> . past studies of electrophysiology have demonstrated that odonates have between 3- <dig> opsin copies for colour detection . we identified four types of opsins  in  <dig> different transcripts. the blastx homology search revealed that, on average, the identified opsins have more than 60% similarity with the identified homologous protein, although several showed more than 80% similarity. the abundance estimation performed on all opsins reported a fpkm  value of at least  <dig> in the head tissue . among the four types of opsins detected in i. elegans, the long-wavelength-sensitive opsin  <dig> showed the highest expression in the head tissue with a fpkm of  <dig> , followed by blue-sensitive opsin with a fpkm of  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

in pigmentation pathways, effector genes encode for co-factors and enzymes involved in the synthesis of pigments and patterning genes regulate the distribution of pigments by influencing the activating of effector gene  <cit> . we identified  <dig> enzymes in the  <dig> assembled transcripts belonging to three pigment pathways, namely the melanin , pteridine pathway  and ommochrome . the diagrammatic representation of the enzymes identified in i. elegans in all the three corresponding pathways is shown in figure 5a-c. we also identified seven regulatory proteins  in ten transcripts.figure  <dig>

the melanin pathway is of principal interest in insects because different components in the enzymatic pathway have different and pleiotropic effects on characters involved in mate choice, sexual selection and parasite resistance  <cit>  and possibly also learned mate preferences, which are known to occur in damselflies  <cit> . in the model insect d. melanogaster, dopamine is involved in the reward system and in learning, courtship and sexual behaviour . the enzymes identified in i. elegans in the melanin pathway are tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, yellow and phenoloxidases subunit a <dig> like, which all play important roles in forming black and brown colour pigments in other insects . the phenoloxidase subunit a <dig> like is a copper containing oxidase that catalyses the rate-limiting conversion of tyrosine to dopa, and dopa to dopa quinines  <cit> . in calopterygid damselflies, phenoloxidase is a limiting resource in terms of the life-history allocation between sexual signalling  and innate immune defence against parasitic infections  <cit> . the ommochrome pathway yields red, brown and yellow pigments. the enzymes identified in i. elegans in the ommochrome pathway are tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase like, kynurenine formamidase and kynurenine  <dig> monooxygenase present in cell cytosol  <cit> . the major facilitator superfamily plays an important role in the transport of 3-hydroxykynurenine into the pigment granules, where it undergoes oxidative condensation to form pigment xathommatin and ommins  <cit> . the pteridine biosynthesis pathway produces sepiapterin and biopterin, which are yellow and blue colours. the important enzymes identified in i. elegans in the pathway are guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase, sepiapterin reductase-like, dihydrofolate reductase, pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase-like . we identified all the enzymes involved in melanin, ommochrome and pteridine pathway in i. elegans, except one enzyme  in the pteridine pathway. the blastx analysis performed on all enzymes showed an average similarity of 60% with the identified homologous protein. a detailed list of all the enzymes involved in the three colour pathways with their expression in head, thorax and abdomen is shown in figure 5d and additional file 1: table s <dig> 

on the basis of rna expression of the pigmentation enzymes reported in the additional file 1: table s <dig> and figure 5d, the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase  and yellow gene  that both form black melanin is higher than dopa decarboxylase  that forms brown melanin in the head. this indicates the prominence of black melanin over brown melanin. a similar trend was also observed in the thorax  and abdomen . it hence appears that in i. elegans the formation of black melanin is prominent over brown melanin.

we were also able to identify a large number of patterning genes. we found seven regulatory genes in nine transcripts, namely doublesex, abdominal-a, wingless, decapentapleic, bric-a-brac, ultrabithorax and distal-less . extensive pigmentation studies performed on d. melanogaster and other insects have reported a role of some of these regulatory elements in pigmentation patterning with strong links to sexual selection, sexual dimorphism and speciation in these more modern insect groups  <cit> . in the future, identification of pattering genes can help to answer questions related to sex-specific pigmentation in i. elegans and other odonate species that show genetic colour polymorphisms.

other important findings
odorant-binding protein and receptors
we identified odorant-binding proteins , olfactory receptor , ionotropic receptors  and gustatory receptors  that were expressed in all three tissues . this is of principal interest as odonates have until quite recently been thought to have poor olfaction and mainly communicate through visual signals. recent behavioural and electrophysiological work, however, indicates that olfaction might be important also in odonates, at least in the context of foraging  <cit> . future studies on odonates should investigate if the odour and taste receptors that have been shown to be important in the detection of food, mates and oviposition sites in modern insects like drosophila
 <cit>  are operating also in this very ancient insect group, which its long history of independent evolution from the well-investigated model insect systems.

heat and cold shock proteins
we identified seven different types of heat shock proteins , three types of heat shock factors and two cold shock proteins in  <dig> transcripts. the hsp identified are hsp  <dig>  hsp  <dig> , hsp  <dig>  hsp  <dig>  hsp67b <dig>  hsp <dig>  hspgp <dig>  heat shock factor, heat shock factor 2-binding protein, heat shock factor binding and small hsp. the most expressed hsp in the head was hsp  <dig>  followed by hsp  <dig> , in the thorax small hsp  followed by hsp  <dig>  and in the abdomen hsp  <dig>  followed by smallhsp .

the cold shock proteins identified are cold shock domain-containing protein e <dig> and cold shock domain protein a. for detailed description about the expression and homology of heat and cold shock proteins refer additional file 1: table s <dig> 

transient receptor potential  channel
trp channels are of ecological interest for research on thermal adaptation, as these insects are known to thermoregulate, in spite of being ectothermic animals  <cit> . moreover, some of the larger odonates  can even generate heat internally, through muscle movement and thermogenesis  <cit> . the ability to thermoregulate is likely to be under strong natural and sexual selection, with latitudinal gradients and phylogenetic inertia are likely to have jointly shaped the phenotypic traits underlying thermal plasticity and thermal niches  <cit> . here, we identified eight different types of trp in  <dig> transcripts. the different types of trp identified are trp channel, trp cation channel subfamily a member 1-like , trp cation channel subfamily v member  <dig>  trp channel pyrexia, trp cation channel protein painless-like, trp cation channel cg34123-like, short trp channel 5-like and trp-gamma. in head trp channelwas most expressed , followed by trp cation channel subfamily a , whereas in thorax and abdomen trp channel was most expressed , followed by trp cation channel cg <dig>  .

CONCLUSIONS
the de novo transcriptome of i. elegans is the most complete transcriptome assembly of an odonate species to date and fills a major taxonomic gap. the annotated genes provide an important toolkit for future studies on colour, vision, olfaction and temperature sensitivity in this and other species. in particular, the data from this study will provide baseline knowledge for future studies investigating the molecular and genomic basis behind the evolution of colour polymorphism in odonata, and the associated changes in vision, which may have facilitated phenotypic divergence in this ancient insect order. moreover, the findings in this study should also facilitate future comparative genomic investigations between odonates and more modern insect groups, including model organisms like apis mellifera, drosophila melanogaster and tribolium castaneum.
