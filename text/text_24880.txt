BACKGROUND
downy mildew in sunflowers  is caused by the oomycete plasmopara halstedii  berlese et de toni. both the host plant and the pathogen species originated in north america, where co-evolution has taken place  <cit> . as the result of the fast evolution of the pathogen and despite considerable efforts by public research and seed companies, downy mildew remains a major risk for the crop, as new races of the pathogen are bypassing the resistance of sunflower hybrids  <cit> , which is generally based on race-specific pl genes  <cit> . one of the strategies used to enhance the durability of disease resistance to downy mildew in the field consists of identifying quantitative resistance loci in plants  <cit>  and improving the knowledge about the genetic variability of the pathogen to make molecular tools available that will assist in genotyping new p. halstedii isolates. previous studies have already been conducted at the molecular level to analyze the interaction between h. annuus and p. halstedii  <cit> . downy mildew isolates have been collected from diseased plants in the field and designated as races based on their divergent virulence profiles in a set of differential hosts that carry different pl resistance genes  <cit> . fourteen different reference races of this pathogen have now been characterized in france, nine of which emerged in the last ten years  <cit> . using a combination of snp markers  <cit> , delmotte et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> individual isolates covering all  <dig> races that are found in france. using these data, they observed a strong correlation between genetic and phenotypic structure, indicating that the  <dig> races fall into three distinct groups. each of these genetically differentiated groups included one of the main races found in france:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . however, the genetic structure evidence might only reflect the neutral genetic structure of french p. halstedii populations because the snp markers used do not provide any relevant functional information with respect to pathogenicity profiles.

p. halstedii is an oomycete from the peronosporaceae family. oomycetes form a group which is distinct from fungi  <cit>  and include many plant pathogens, such as phytophthora and downy mildews . the pathosystems hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis/arabidopsis thaliana and bremia lactucae/lactuca sativa are well-studied model systems for downy mildews . downy mildews are obligate biotrophs and therefore require living hosts to survive. using infection structures, such as haustoria, the pathogen draws nutrients from its host and releases enzymes and effectors into the host's cells.

effectors are defined as key elements of pathogenicity that have been shown modulating the host's defense system and enabling tissue colonization in other model pathosystems  <cit> , but not in the helianthus annuus * plasmopara halstedii pathosystem up to now. in oomycetes, two classes of cytoplasmic effectors have been characterized, rxlr and crn   <cit> . the rxlr-deer motif of the rxlr protein family was discovered by comparing the protein sequences of avr1b, avr3a, atr <dig> and atr <dig>  <cit> . crn <dig> and crn <dig> are two cell-death-inducing proteins that cause crinkling and necrosis phenotypes in the leaves of infected plants  <cit> .

bouzidi et al.  <cit>  used a genomics approach to identify genes involved in the h. annuus/p. halstedii interaction. they employed a subtractive hybridization method  in sunflower seedlings infected by p. halstedii. a total of  <dig> ests were identified as specific to the oomycete, but no effector was highlighted.

the advent of next-generation sequencing methods with reduced costs and higher throughput has encouraged the generation of more comprehensive and in-depth studies for a wider range of organisms and transcriptomes  <cit> . one of these methods that makes it possible to generate valuable information for species with high economic interest but limited genomic resources is  <dig> pyrosequencing technology  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> sequencing allows the identification of allelic variations and constitution of haplotypes  <cit> .

in the context of sustainable agriculture, management of durable genetic resistance and minimization of selective pressure on pathogens are key objectives. enriching the genomic resources available for exploring the interaction between h. annuus and p. halstedii is crucial for research on p. halstedii, especially with respect to discovering the effectors involved in its pathogenicity. in this study, a  <dig> flx pyrosequencing of cdnas from h. annuus seedlings infected by p. halstedii was performed to produce sequences expressed by either organism in the frame of their interaction. the resulting assembly was searched for effectors, such as rxlr and crn; the polymorphisms of these effectors between the four races of p. halstedii were used as markers for re-evaluating their genetic relationships.

RESULTS
 <dig> pyrosequencing and assembly of hp clusters
two sunflower lines that are susceptible  or resistant  to infection by p. halstedii race  <dig> were analyzed. the psc <dig> samples infected with p. halstedii race  <dig>  generated  <dig>  reads , while the infected xrq samples  generated  <dig>  reads . after trimming and cleaning procedures,  <dig>   and  <dig>   useable reads were obtained.

these reads were pooled with  <dig>  h. annuus est and mrna sequences and  <dig> p. halstedii est and mrna sequences that were available in genbank  to assemble clusters. this clustering produced  <dig>  contigs and singletons. the hp database produced is available at http://www.heliagene.org/hp. of these,  <dig>  hp clusters are considered new because they could not be assembled with any publically available h. annuus or p. halstedii ests. the clusters obtained were annotated as hpxxxxx , and for simplicity, they will be designated as hp clusters hereafter.

information sequence similarities for each cluster were collected from the heliagene , genbank , tair, put , interpro, and swissprot databases and were incorporated in the hp database. an oomycete database  was created from all of the oomycete sequences available in genbank  and was thereafter updated to include the hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis sequences that were made available to the scientific community in december  <dig> . this database was used to search for similarities with oomycete sequences. this information was also incorporated in the hp database. figure  <dig> describes the analysis workflow used in this study.

in silico identification of p. halstedii sequences
the hp clusters originated from cdnas of infected sunflower samples and could therefore correspond to either h. annuus or p. halstedii. to identify putative plasmopara sequences, an in silico selection procedure was applied, based on tblastx results that were obtained from different databases   <cit> .

first, using tblastx searches with  an expect value  lower than 1e- <dig> against the oom database and  an e-value greater than 1e- <dig> against the put or heliagene databases, which indicated poor match with plant sequences,  <dig> hp clusters were defined as specific oomycete sequences . among these,  <dig> clusters were found to be specific to the infected, susceptible sunflower line, psc <dig>  while  <dig> clusters were specific to the infected, resistant sunflower line, xrq. a total of  <dig> clusters were found to be common to both samples. among the  <dig> candidate oomycete clusters,  <dig> clusters were highly represented in the infected psc <dig> line , whereas none of the clusters were highly represented in xrq. this can be explained by the resistant genetic background of the xrq line with respect to race  <dig>  which results in very little multiplication of p. halstedii in the tissues of these plants in contrast to the susceptible psc <dig> plants. the high level of oomycete multiplication in infected psc <dig> plants was expected given the susceptibility of psc <dig> to the race  <dig>  and was confirmed based on the large amount of p. halstedii ribosomal rna in the total rna in the psc <dig> sample compared to the total rna in the sample from the infected xrq resistant line .

next, as some hp candidates could belong to either h. annuus or p. halstedii due to the in silico  proximity of the two species, a class of "non-specific oomycete" clusters was selected using two tblastx criteria:  only hp clusters with an e-value < 1e- <dig> against the oom database were considered, and  among those, only the hp clusters for which e-values against the oom database were  <dig>  times smaller than the e-values against the put or heliagene databases were retained. this selection led to the identification of  <dig> hp clusters as "non-specific oomycete" sequences that are expressed by the pathogen during interactions with the plant . of these,  <dig> clusters were selected for validation based on the high proportion of reads  in the psc8-infected sample.

validation of the in silico-predicted oomycete sequences by pcr amplification with genomic dna
fifty-two sequences that were highly expressed in psc <dig>  were selected to check the accuracy of the in silico filtering. thirty-five of these were specific oomycete clusters, while the remaining  <dig> sequences belonged to the non-specific oomycete category. they were tested by pcr amplification using h. annuus  and p. halstedii  genomic dna. a total of  <dig> amplifications produced a unique band when tested in p. halstedii dna. seven amplifications produced a band when using either h. annuus  or p. halstedii  dna. no amplification was obtained with the last six clusters for either type of genomic dna. importantly, none of the  <dig> sequences produced amplified bands only when tested with h. annuus dna, thus validating the in silico filtering process which was used in this study. similar amplification patterns were obtained with psc <dig> and race  <dig> genomic dna. regarding the six clusters that amplified both plant and oomycete genomic dna, the band amplified from p. halstedii dna exhibited the expected size, while the bands amplified using h. annuus dna presented a lower molecular size , suggesting that they are likely due to non-specific amplification, which can be caused by a homologous but shorter sequence in helianthus or low-specificity primers. due to the approximately 85% correct predictions and the lack of any amplifications being obtained only with helianthus dna, the in silico filtering method was considered as providing reliable results, and it was therefore assumed that a large majority of clusters were accurately allocated to their respective categories.

biological features of the p. halstedii predicted sequences
the  <dig> oomycete-specific clusters and the  <dig> non-specific oomycete clusters that were confirmed by pcr to be of p. halstedii origin were examined to describe the biological features of the potential new p. halstedii sequences. among these  <dig> clusters, only  <dig>  corresponded to p. halstedii sequences that were already present in the genbank database, indicating that this study provides  <dig> potentially new p. halstedii genes that are expressed during interaction with sunflowers, increasing the number of sequences present in the database by at least  <dig> fold  <cit> . of these  <dig> previously identified p. halstedii sequences, nine clusters correspond to ribosomal protein gene sequences ; two encode a protein with an interpro nac motif  ; one contained a putative wd <dig> domain; one was similar to a glucose transporter; one was similar to f1-atp synthase; and one had an nadph oxidoreductase domain. the remaining  <dig> clusters encoded unknown p. halstedii proteins and showed no significant similarities to other organisms . most of the  <dig> new p. halstedii sequences encoded putative proteins with unknown functions, and only  <dig> of the predicted proteins had an interpro motif. these new p. halstedii cluster sequences presented strong tblastx e-values associated with different oomycete sequences present in the oom database. a total of  <dig> clusters  exhibited highest tblastx homology to seven phytophthora species, with the most represented being p. infestans  and p. capsici . the other top similarity scores were found with hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  and, to a much lesser extent, with phytophthora parasitica , p. sojae , p. brassicae  and pythium ultimum . no significant similarity was found with aphanomyces euteiches sequences. these proportions are expected to be partly biased by the representation of the different oomycete species in the oom database that was built  but likely also correspond to the phylogenetic relationships between the different oomycetes. surprisingly, fewer hits were found against hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, which is considered as a phylogenetically close relative to p. halstedii  <cit> . because p. halstedii is a member of the peronosporaceae, it was not surprising to find that it is more closely related to phytophthora species than to p. ultimum or a. euteiches . phytophthora species are phylogenetically close to downy mildews, such as p. halstedii and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit> ; both exhibit specialized infection structures called haustoria, and their genomes encode rxlr-eer type effectors  .

searching for h. annuus sequences expressed during infection by p. halstedii
using a tblastx analysis with a cut-off e-value of 1e- <dig> against the put and heliagene databases and no match to the oom database,  <dig>  hp clusters were predicted to be of plant origin. among these, searches were carried out using the keywords "defense", "disease" and "pathogenesis" within the interpro and go fields of the tblastx results against different databases  and the interpro scan results. a total of  <dig> clusters was obtained , and a total of  <dig> of those was tested to determine their host origin by pcr amplification using sunflower and downy mildew genomic dna. only 30% of the clusters were found to be specific to h. annuus  . of these, eight putative nbs-lrrs  were detected as well as an eds- <dig> , eds- <dig>  and ein <dig> , while  <dig> % of the clusters led to an amplified band of the same size using both p. halstedii  and h. annuus dna. these results indicate that the filter requiring no match to the oom database was insufficiently selective, likely due to the lack of plasmopara sequences in the oom database.

searching for p. halstedii putative effector sequences using psi-blast
recently, many studies have shown a vast repertoire of cytoplasmic and apoplastic effector proteins in oomycetes. within the class of cytoplasmic effectors, the rxlr and crinkler  families have been especially well studied  <cit> . rxlr and crn proteins are secreted in haustoria and translocated into host cells to modulate host defenses and enable pathogenicity  <cit> . in addition to a signal peptide, rxlr proteins exhibit a characteristic rxlr amino acid motif that is sometimes associated with a -deer motif, while crn proteins show a characteristic lxlflak motif. the oom database was searched for similarity to known oomycete effectors using the psi-tblastn method   <cit> . all of the rxlr and crn sequences available in genbank were used to construct two corresponding matrices for the psi-tblastn search. a total of  <dig> putative crn clusters and five putative rxlr clusters were found in the hp database. these relatively short clusters obtained from cdna that came from plants infected by race  <dig> were elongated using other cdna sequences obtained by germinating spore materials from different races . the elongated, generated clusters are described in additional files  <dig> & <dig> 

• rxlr putative sequences: the five putative p. halstedii rxlr proteins detected as being homologous to oomycete effectors by psi-tblastn included a predicted signal peptide and are therefore likely secreted along with the eer motif. the following rxlr motives were found: rlli , rllr , or a putative motif . the encoded predicted peptide sequences  did not show any significant homology with known peptide sequences due in part to the large variability of rxlr sequences but also because they are short , with the exception of phrxlr_ <dig> .

• crn putative sequences: among the putative p. halstedii crn sequences,  <dig> included the characteristic lxlflak crn translocation motif  <dig> amino acids after the first methionine  <cit> , and the eight others exhibited a close variant motif or lxlslak. only  <dig> of these sequences presented a predicted signal peptide, but previous studies have made similar observations for crn  <cit> . the multalin  <cit>  alignment of  <dig> of the phcrn sequences showed a conserved n-terminal region of approximately  <dig> amino acids. in  <dig> out of  <dig> of the predicted peptides longer than  <dig> amino acids, a conserved hvlvvp motif  followed by variable c-terminal regions was found . this organization is reminiscent of crn proteins from phytophthora  <cit> . alignment with  <dig> crn proteins from hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  showed a high degree of conservation of the first  <dig> amino acids between the two oomycete species, with  <dig> conserved  and  <dig> conservative  amino acid residues being observed, likely related to their close phylogenetic relationship   <cit> . all of the phcrn predicted peptide sequences exhibited tblastn hits with the oom database of predicted gene models, which includes data on h. arabidopsidis. ten out of  <dig> of these phcrn sequences showed the best hit against phytophthora infestans; the remaining sequences best matched phytophthora capsici . this result suggests that p. halstedii is closer to phytophthora species than to h. arabidopsidis based on their crn profiles. this provides new insight with respect to the relationship between the pathogenicity profiles of the oomycetes, which was not anticipated according to  <cit> . most of the predicted sequences exhibited the best hit against uncharacterized proteins from phytophthora sp. and did not give any clue regarding their putative function. intriguingly, phcrn_ <dig>  _ <dig> and _ <dig> include an interpro domain, ipr <dig>  which corresponds to an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase domain that is typically found in bacterial genes and confers antibiotic resistance by phosphorylation  <cit> . as none of the predicted phrxlr effector peptide sequences showed a hit against the same database, this suggests less specificity in phcrn effectors than in rxlr effectors.

our data indicate, for the first time, that p. halstedii exhibits the same kind of crn and rxlr cytoplasmic effectors that have been found in other oomycetes and that there is greater specificity in rxlr effectors than in crn effectors.

time course for phcrn effector expression during h. annuus * p. halstedii interactions
to validate the in planta expression of some of these putative effectors, time course expression experiments were performed for  <dig> of them using quantitative rt-pcr . cdna samples were obtained from three independent inoculation tests from two genotypes  infected with two p. halstedii races , which induced incompatible  and compatible  interactions. in the non-inoculated plant samples , no expression was detected with the set of primers that was used, suggesting p. halstedii specificity. in the inoculated plant samples, time course expression values  were calculated and tested for statistical significance using anova with the following variation factors: days post inoculation , type of interaction , and p. halstedii race .

the time course response was found highly statistically significant as stated by anova , with a general increase in expression observed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi for phcrn_ <dig>  phcrn_ <dig>  phcrn_ <dig>  phcrn_ <dig>  and phcrn_ <dig>  whereas phcrn_ <dig> was repressed at  <dig> dpi and was subsequently expressed at the same level as the control genes . in contrast, the expression of phcrn_ <dig> and phcrn_ <dig> did not vary significantly according to inoculation time but did show a differential induction between  <dig> and  <dig> races .

a difference in the time course of expression between compatible and incompatible interactions was found for phcrn_ <dig> and phcrn_ <dig>  which were less expressed at  <dig> dpi  in incompatible than in compatible interactions . a statistically significant difference in the expression levels during infection between race  <dig> and race  <dig> was found for phcrn_ <dig> that was independent of the type of interaction, suggesting that this effector could play a role in the aggressiveness of the race .

search for polymorphic sites in effector sequences for the four races of p. halstedii
using the available sequences from the four p. halstedii races, specific assemblies were built for each race  based on the highest frequency of alleles at each nucleic acid position. these results were used to search for polymorphisms in the phcrn and phrxlr dna and predicted protein sequences .

*: polymorphism within the race  <dig> only

seven of the  <dig> putative crns were found to exhibit polymorphisms at the dna level with a relatively high frequency of non-synonymous changes, leading to modification of the proteins' composition that may result in an alteration of the proteins' function or conformation. this could indicate a likely change in the effector profile of the race. as seen in table  <dig>  some clusters contained several polymorphic sites.

in contrast, none of the tested rxlr proteins were found to be polymorphic. this might be due to lower read counts in the different races for these potential effectors. additionally, the search for polymorphisms was performed using effector transcript sequences, and it is possible that non-coding upstream sequences are more polymorphic. alternatively, this could mean that the variability in crn and rxlr does not expand in the same manner; crn effectors appear to be more conserved across species but to present higher variability within species, whereas rxlr effectors are less conserved between species but show reduced variability within species.

inter-racial and intra-racial polymorphisms
these polymorphisms were detected by comparing the predicted peptide sequences of the different races based on the most frequent allele detected for each race. however, this does not mean that each race has a unique profile. for example, non-synonymous polymorphisms for phcrn_ <dig> are observed within race  <dig> . intra-racial polymorphisms seemed to be the general pattern: as shown in table  <dig>  synonymous or non-synonymous snps are both  frequently observed within a race and  associated with significant or non-significant differences between races, depending on the case.

frequencies for each allele for each race are indicated. the khi- <dig> calculations refer to h0: similar frequencies between races at each position .

there are several possible explanations for this result. it may represent polymorphisms within a race that are due to one heterozygous genotype , a mixture of homozygous genotypes or a mixture of these two situations, with the last possibility being more likely based on the frequencies that were observed. alternatively, this result could be related to the definition of a "race", which is not a clonal genotype but an isolate showing particular differential responses when inoculated into a set of selected sunflower lines  <cit> . whatever the case, intra-racial polymorphisms may not be linked to interactions between these races and the nine different sunflower lines that are usually used to differentiate p. halstedii races. however, including other genetic backgrounds on the host side could allow for better discrimination of pathogen intra-racial polymorphisms.

a factorial correspondence analysis  was performed on a data table  in which each cell contains the number of reads obtained for each of the four p. halstedii races and each crn snp as a combination of the crn effector, snp positions leading to a non-synonymous variation, and amino acid substitutions . this analysis makes it possible to visualize the genetic distances between the four races based on their snps. the genetic distances between the three races  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the fca diagram indicate significant differences, in accordance with the hypothesis of three genetically differentiated groups of p. halstedii races  <cit> . certain snps could allow for clear differentiation between race  <dig> and race  <dig> , which has not been observed previously  <cit> .

the use of these new snp markers located in putative effector sequences should provide an additional tool to extend the polymorphism analyses allowed by the  <dig> previously published est-derived markers  <cit> . they should also lead to a better definition of what the genetic structure of a "race" is and allow for better discrimination between races, which will make it possible to re-evaluate the genetic structure and evolution of populations of p. halstedii. moreover, snp markers are considered the most useful markers in diploid organisms because they are co-dominant, specific and easy to use with new genotyping techniques. it is important to extend this work in the future by sequencing additional races and identifying more snps in putative effector sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents a substantial improvement of existing knowledge regarding p. halstedii sequences that are expressed during the interaction of this species with sunflowers. this work also reveals infection mechanisms similar to those observed in other oomycetes and the presence of putative rxlr and crn effectors. using polymorphic sites in crn effector sequences, the observed genetic distances between three races  were shown to be in agreement with the conclusions of delmotte et al.  <cit> . certain snps might allow for clear differentiation between races  <dig> and  <dig> , which has not been detected previously  <cit> .

to improve the knowledge regarding the genetic structure of p. halstedii populations, it is necessary to obtain polymorphism data for all of the recorded races and to include different geographical isolates for each race, particularly because intra-racial polymorphisms appear to be significant in this study. these results increase interest in reassessing the current classification of p. halstedii isolates based on a description other than their interaction with different sunflower lines. this re-evaluation could be performed using a larger set of molecular markers, particularly snps, that occur mainly in effector sequences, which should be under higher selective pressure.
