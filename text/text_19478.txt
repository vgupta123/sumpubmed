BACKGROUND
animals possess a number of chemosensory systems that enable them to perceive diverse stimuli in the environment. one such system is the olfactory system, which detects chemicals by a large number of olfactory sensory neurons  in the nose. in mammals, each osn expresses a single allele of one odorant receptor  <cit>  on a dendrite that is exposed to the external world, and on an axon terminal that extends into the brain  <cit> . the projection of osns is highly ordered: all neurons expressing a given receptor converge to the same region in the ipsilateral olfactory bulb  <cit> , terminating in a single glomerulus, i. e., a spherical area of dense synaptic neuropil. guidance of axons is determined by a combination of factors, including the odorant receptors  <cit> . as a result of this well-ordered projection, chemical information is presented to the brain as spatial activity patterns across the array of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb  <cit> .

olfactory sensory neurons are morphologically diverse, consisting of ciliated, microvillous and crypt neurons. in fish, there appears to be some correlation between neuronal morphology, receptor class, g-protein type, and ligand spectrum  <cit> . ciliated osns express receptors similar to those found in the main olfactory system of mammals express the gαolf subunit and respond to amino acids or nucleotides. microvillous neurons, on the other hand, express receptors from the v2r family found in the vomeronasal system of mammals, gαo, gαq or gαi- <dig>  and respond to amino acids or bile acids. in mammals, microvillous neurons detect pheromones, but can also respond to other odors  <cit> . crypt neurons, which have a distinct rounded morphology, also contain gαq in the apical region. different classes of osns project to different regions of the olfactory bulb  <cit> .

the recombination activation gene, rag <dig>  is expressed in the olfactory epithelium of mice and zebrafish  <cit> . the rag <dig> gene, together with rag <dig>  is thought to have entered the genome of an ancestral organism  <dig> million years ago, soon after the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates; both genes have remained adjacent to one another throughout evolution. acting together, rag <dig> and rag <dig> proteins function similarly to bacterial transposases such as tn <dig> and are able to cleave dna in a sequence-specific manner  <cit> . they mediate vj recombination, and are thus responsible for the generation of antibodies and t-cell receptors  <cit> . as a result, each rag <dig> expressing immune cell has a different identity, characterized by a permanent change to its genome, as well as the proteins expressed on its surface. mutations in rag <dig>  <cit>  or rag <dig>  <cit>  lead to immunodeficiency.

the function of rag <dig> in the olfactory system is unclear, although there has been some speculation that dna rearrangement could be involved in odorant receptor expression  <cit> . as a step towards understanding the role of rag <dig>  we have initiated a study using the zebrafish, a model system with a relatively well-characterized olfactory system  <cit> . the transparency of the zebrafish larva enables gene expression analysis at single cell resolution, while genetics and morpholinos provide tools for assessing gene function using anatomical or physiological methods. our results suggest that rag <dig> protein is present in a subset of osns, including some microvillous olfactory neurons, but is not required for axon targeting.

RESULTS
rag <dig> expression in the zebrafish olfactory system
using a transgenic zebrafish line in which the coding sequence of rag <dig> within a pac was replaced with gfp, shuo lin and colleagues have reported the expression of rag <dig> in olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> . to confirm the fidelity of gfp expression, double-labelling with antibodies to zebrafish rag <dig> and gfp was carried out. the specificity of the rag <dig> antibody was first tested by preabsorption and immunofluorescence on thymocytes . olfactory neurons from  <dig> day-old rag1:gfp fish were then isolated, fixed and doubled-labelled. in these cells, two classes of gfp expression was seen – bright and dim. an overlap of rag <dig>  and gfp  immunofluorescence  was observed. from  <dig> double-labelling experiments,  <dig> out of  <dig> cells with high levels of gfp were found to be rag1-positive, with label predominantly in the nucleus.  <dig> out of  <dig> cells that expressed a lower level of gfp were also rag1-positive. these observations establish that rag <dig> protein is present in olfactory neurons, and that gfp expression in the transgenic line can serve as an indicator of endogenous rag <dig> 

we imaged the rag1:gfp fish at high resolution to determine in more detail the expression of rag <dig> in the zebrafish olfactory system. gfp was first detectable at  <dig> hours post-fertilization, and both bright and dim cells could be seen in the olfactory epithelium . initially, only short axons were visible. by  <dig> hours, the number of fluorescing cells increased and axons reached the olfactory bulb . fluorescing neurons projected axons to the lateral region of the ob . intense labelling was detected in one target , which is a glomerular neuropil structure, as identified by labelling with the synaptic vesicle marker sv <dig>  <cit>  . synaptic vesicles co-localize with the termini of gfp-positive axons in this glomerular structure. .

when the fluorescent lipophilic dye dii was placed in the fish water, many osns took up the dye . however, few  strongly gfp-expressing neurons were labelled . this suggests a low accessibility to the external environment within this subpopulation. with di8aneppq, a lipophilic dye with higher solubility, a higher proportion  of strong gfp-positive cells were labelled , confirming that they do have some access to the water. we then examined rag <dig> expression in fish expressing taudsred under the control of a promoter fragment of the olfactory marker protein  gene  <cit> . in this line, taudsred is expressed in most osns except for a subpopulation projecting to a lateral area in the developing ob  <cit> . in rag1:gfp, omp:taudsred double transgenic fish, gfp was detected in osns that were taudsred-negative . the gfp-positive neurons appeared to have a shorter cell body than those expressing taudsred.

when labelled with antibodies to different g-alpha subunits, cells with strong gfp expression were gαolf, gαo and gαq-negative . crypt cells or other neurons that were labelled by the gαq antibody were gfp-negative .  <dig> out of  <dig> neurons containing gαo expressed gfp at low levels . the remaining cells had no gfp. an additional  <dig> cells had low gfp expression, but did not express gαo. these observations indicate that the gfp-expressing cells are heterogenous in nature.

in the adult, gfp expression could still be detected in the olfactory system. most gfp-positive neurons had their cells bodies close to the apical surface of the olfactory epithelium, with dendrites of intermediate length; a few cells, however, had their soma deep in the epithelium . gfp-positive axons project to the lateral olfactory bulb only, as can be seen in dissected forebrains, or using immunofluorescence on sections . a subset of axons projecting to one target in the lateral bulb contained particularly high levels of gfp .

the effect of rag <dig> knockdown on axon targeting
the expression of gfp in a subpopulation of neurons that project to one region of the olfactory bulb raises the possibility that rag <dig> could be involved in specifying the identity, and hence the axonal targeting, of these neurons. to test this idea, three morpholinos were used to knock down rag <dig> in embryos. the first morpholino  targeted the start codon of rag <dig> and was tested using a fusion of the 5' end of rag <dig> to gfp. injection of mrna for the fusion protein alone led to a strong fluorescence , whereas co-injection with the morpholino suppressed fluorescence , indicating that mo <dig> knocked down rag <dig> translation. the second morpholino  was targeted to the splice donor site of the first exon . injection of this morpholino led to aberrant splicing , resulting in an mrna with a premature stop codon . the third morpholino  was designed to the donor site of the second exon , and this resulted in loss of the normal transcript . splice donor morpholinos were tested because the use of internal atgs, which has been reported for some forms of omenn's syndrome  <cit> , might obscure the effects of mo <dig> 

injection of mo <dig> caused a reduction in the level of gfp driven by the rag <dig> promoter. this occurred despite there being an 8-nucleotide mismatch in the transgene , presumably because the mismatch is contiguous and exclusively at one end of the morpholino. the convergence of brighter axons to one lateral target persisted . aside from the decrease in gfp expression, no other defect could be detected. with mo <dig>  injections of  <dig>  μm caused slight non-specific morphological abnormalities, such as small eyes. injection with  <dig>  μm mo <dig> caused stronger abnormalities. less abnormality was seen when a mixture of  <dig>  μm mo <dig> and  <dig>  μm mo <dig> was injected. this led to a dramatic loss of normally spliced rag <dig> mrna . injection of either mo <dig> or mo <dig> or the mixture did not cause any defect in the targeting of the gfp-expressing neurons . hence strong rag <dig> expression is not required for innervation of the lateral target.

as an additional step in analysing the role of rag <dig> in establishing the olfactory projection, a line carrying a point mutation, leading to a stop codon within the rag <dig> catalytic domain  <cit> , was examined. the entire projection was labeled with the lipophilic tracer di8aneppq. no obvious difference could be seen between mutants and wild types . to further analyse mutants, the forebrains of  <dig> day-old larvae were labelled with the sv <dig> antibody. the lateral neuropil structure that is innervated by neurons with strong gfp expression could be visualized in mutants, as in wild types . together with the morpholino data, these observations indicate that rag <dig> is not required for pathfinding of osn axons to the olfactory bulb, or for establishment of glomeruli.

odor-evoked activity maps in the rag <dig> mutant
the spatial organization of osn axons in the olfactory bulb and their functionality was further examined by calcium imaging of odor-evoked activity maps in  <dig> month-old fish. osn axons were loaded with the calcium indicator, calcium green-1-dextran. odor-evoked activity in osn axons leads to calcium influx at axon terminals, causing a localized change in indicator fluorescence. this method allows for the optical detection of odor-evoked activity selectively in osn axons within glomeruli  <cit> . in wild type fish, amino acids evoke activity predominantly in the ventro-lateral region of the ob that contains densely packed, small glomeruli  <cit> . within this region, clusters of glomeruli can be identified by their response to amino acids sharing particular chemical features . response patterns vary considerably between individuals, but functionally defined clusters are found at similar relative positions along the anterior-to-posterior axis in different individuals, thus establishing a conserved chemotopic map  <cit> .

the distribution and magnitude of response patterns evoked by a diagnostic set of l-amino acids with different chemical features  were generally similar in wild type and rag <dig> mutant fish . however, in both wild type and rag <dig> mutants, the fine structure of these activity patterns varied between individuals. to examine the chemotopic organization in more detail, we therefore defined three glomerular regions by characteristic response properties, as done previously to identify chemotopically organized glomerular clusters  <cit> . the first region was defined by responses to the basic amino acid, lys, and partially to trp , the second region was defined by responses to all short-chain neutral stimuli , and the third region was defined by the response to the long-chain neutral amino acids, val and met . regions with these functional properties were identifiable in each wild type and rag <dig> mutant fish. their spatial arrangement was analyzed by overlaying the outlines of the regions from different individuals. in both wt  and rag <dig> mutant  fish, the three clusters occurred in a characteristic sequence along the anterior-to-posterior axis , as described previously  <cit> . hence, the chemotopic organization of glomerular response maps was comparable in wild type and rag <dig> mutant fish. other response properties, such as wide-spread responses to food extracts  <cit> , were also similar between wild types and rag <dig> mutants . we also quantitatively analyzed the similarity relationships between activity patterns evoked by different stimuli using correlation and factor analysis  <cit>  and observed no obvious differences between wild type and rag <dig> mutant fish. hence, physiological responses of osns to amino acids and their chemotopically organized projections to the ob were not detectably altered in rag <dig> mutants.

discussion
to delineate possible functions of rag <dig> in the zebrafish olfactory system, we have examined its expression pattern in detail and examined the effect of rag <dig> loss. immunofluorescence using an antibody to zebrafish rag <dig> indicates that the protein is present in osns. imaging of a transgenic line, which is a sensitive method to monitor gene expression in neurons  <cit> , suggests that rag <dig> is expressed only in a subset of osns. some of the neurons expressing rag <dig> are likely to be microvillous neurons, as indicated by their morphology and gαo expression. neurons expressing gfp project to the lateral bulb, which is a region of the bulb known to contain termini of amino-acid sensitive osns  <cit> . their projection pattern appears to be complementary to neurons expressing a reporter under the omp promoter, as these project to the medial bulb  <cit> . rag <dig> expression thus appears to mark a subset of distinct osns. these neurons are likely to be heterogenous, given that not all of them express gαo.

a feature of the rag1:gfp transgenic line analyzed here is that one glomerular target in each bulb is more brightly labelled than other targets. one interpretation of this observation, given that some cell bodies, axons and termini are brighter than others, is that neurons expressing gfp at high levels all have a particular identity and project to a single target. these neurons do not express any of the markers tested, possibly because of their distinct identity. alternatively, they may not be fully mature when gfp is expressed strongly. this would be consistent with the finding that not all bright neurons take up dii or di8aneppq from the external environment, which would be the case if their dendrites were immature. these neurons may eventually have reduced levels of gfp, and express gαo. it should be noted that high levels of gfp expression cannot be a feature of all immature osns. if this were the case, it would be expected that there would be bright neurons projecting to all glomeruli; this was never seen. although we cannot yet make any firm conclusions as to why some axons are brighter than others, their reproducible targeting can serve as a useful marker in genetic screens or in physiological analysis.

in the olfactory system, sensory neurons are distinguished from one another on the basis of odorant receptor expression, and targeting to a particular glomerulus is dependent on the odorant receptor  <cit> , amongst other axon guidance cues. it has been suggested that odorant receptor expression could be regulated by a mechanism similar to vj recombination, given the genomic organization of the receptors. we found that axon targeting and chemotopic activity maps in the ob were not affected by knockdown of rag <dig> or by a mutation that abolishes the catalytic activity of rag <dig>  hence, it appears that rag <dig> does not have a role in defining the identity of osns. recent cloning experiments show that the genome of mammalian osns is not rearranged  <cit> . those experiments were carried out with neurons expressing receptors of the or class, i.e. those expressing gαolf, which is probably not expressed in rag1-positive osns in zebrafish. the observations described here suggest that this conclusion also holds for other olfactory neurons.

rag <dig> contains the active site for vj recombination  <cit>  and can cleave dna in vitro on its own, although it does so with low efficiency  <cit> . once dna has been cleaved, rag <dig> can bind to the broken ends and serve a protective role  <cit> . given the relatively high rate of dna breaks in neurons  <cit> , one possibility is that rag <dig> protects the genome in some neurons. however, this view does not explain why only a subset of neurons expresses rag <dig>  another function of rag <dig>  provided by the ring-finger, is as an e <dig> ligase  <cit> , raising the possibility that this activity may be required in a subset of receptor neurons. additionally, rag <dig> can independently act as an endonuclease  <cit> . it is apparent that rag <dig> can carry out several functions, but it is unknown at present whether the expression of rag <dig> in the olfactory epithelium reflects any of these abilities. the expression described here suggests that any function of rag <dig> must be restricted to a subset of osns only.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that rag <dig> is expressed and translated in a subset of zebrafish olfactory neurons projecting to the lateral olfactory bulb. some of these neurons express a marker of microvillous neurons. rag <dig> does not appear to be essential for axon targeting or receptor expression.
