BACKGROUND
the bacterio – host arms race represents a dynamic interplay of survival among a population of bacteria and their infecting viral parasites  <cit> . depending on the complexity of the environment, the ongoing antagonistic evolution can generate diverse populations among both phages and their bacterial hosts . host adaptation is driven by the highly selective pressure of lytic phages, while phages are in turn compelled to mutate in order to achieve efficient host infection, combined with, in the case of virulent phages, optimal production and release of progeny particles  <cit> . an example of such adaptive interplay are phages that modify their receptor binding protein  or tail fibres to target a new cell surface receptor if the original receptor becomes unavailable as seen in escherichia coli phage ci <dig>  <cit> . bacterial genomes and plasmids may encode a wide variety of defence mechanisms to combat phage infection, such as restriction-modification systems , abortive infective  systems and crispr-mediated immunity  <cit> . nonetheless, phages have been shown to be able to bypass many of these phage-resistance systems in order to successfully continue their replication and proliferation. for example, phages may evade crispr systems by acquiring mutations in the protospacer, thus preventing complementary binding of the crispr-produced crrna to the target phage dna  <cit> . furthermore, phage genomes have been shown to acquire methyltransferase -encoding genes, which are termed orphan mtases if they occur in the absence of their cognate restriction enzyme-encoding gene  <cit> . their function is to actively methylate phage dna to negate the activity of host encoded restriction endonucleases which recognize the same sequence. mtase-encoding genes are found on the genomes of, among others, t-even phages of e. coli, several bacillus subtilis phages, and the lactococcal phi- <dig>  . in some cases phages have been shown to specify complete r-m systems as observed in the staphylococcus aureus quadruple converting  phage π <dig>  which harbours a bcgi-like r-m system  <cit> .

in the dairy industry, selection of phage-resistant starter cultures coupled with extensive phage control strategies may reduce the risk of phage infection of hosts and decrease their ability to engage in antagonistic evolution . however, some examples of 936-type phages overcoming host-encoded systems include mutations in the sak and sav genes, which allow such mutated phages  to circumvent the abortive infection systems abik  <cit>  and abiv, respectively  <cit> . most recently it has been demonstrated that certain mutations in the gene specifying the major capsid protein allow the 936-type phage sk <dig> to overcome the abib system of l. lactis uc <dig>   <cit> . previously, we reported on the isolation of phages from a mixed starter system  <cit> , and showed that, consistent with earlier surveys  <cit>  members of the 936-type phages are the only detected phages within the examined fermentation facilities. the reasons behind the persistence and prevalence of the 936-type phages are undoubtedly multifactorial and encoded by their genome, which encompasses many genes without an assigned function. the 936-type phage genomes, with sizes ranging from 26–32 kb, are modular in organisation and are clustered into late, early and middle-expressed genes, with the early transcript encompassing the largest number of genes with unknown function  <cit> . the advances in sequencing technology and the variety of sequencing platforms available has allowed for a significant increase in the number of fully sequenced phage genomes  <cit> . continued phage isolation and rapid genomic characterization is crucial in order to unravel the underlying reasons and mechanisms for the occurrence and persistence of particular phage species, especially 936-type phages in lactococcal fermentations. here, we report on the genome sequences of three 936-type phages, phi <dig>  phi <dig> and phi <dig>  and for the first time show that the 936-type phages can acquire  mtases which provide a protective effect against specific restriction endonuclease activities.

RESULTS
identification of 936-type phages encoding putative  methyltransferases
initial genome sequencing was performed on a  <dig> device on phage dna isolated from three lactococcal 936-type phages , previously isolated from whey samples obtained from gouda-producing cheese factories   <cit> . the genomic characteristics of the three phages are summarized in table  <dig>  the three genomes each encompass  <dig> orfs , apparently organised into three transcriptional modules , a gene arrangement that is typical for 936-type phages   <cit> . typically, the consensus gene order of the packaging module consists of the gene encoding the putative small terminase subunit followed by that specifying the large terminase subunit as seen, for example, in the genomes of jj <dig>  sk <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . however, this region appears to be a hotspot for genetic insertions and several 936-type phages were observed to possess an additional orf of unknown function located downstream of the gene encoding the small terminase subunit  <cit> . annotation of the genomes revealed that also the genomes of phi <dig>  phi <dig> and phi <dig> each contain additional orfs in this region of their genomes , including orfs that specify putative  mtases . in the case of phi <dig> the deduced protein product of locus tag phi15_ <dig> was predicted to specify a homing endonuclease , while for phi <dig>  the similarly positioned gene, designated here as mtphi145- <dig>    is predicted to encode a putative  mtase, and accordingly named m.phi145i  . the phi <dig> genome has three additional orfs located between the genes that encode the putative large and small terminase subunits: mtphi93- <dig>  hnhphi93- <dig> and mtphi93-dam , which are predicted to specify an mtase, accordingly named m.phi93i, a hnhe, designated as pheasephi93i , and a dam mtase, named m.phi93dam, respectively  . using blastp and hhpred analyses, m.phi145i and m.phi93i, whose amino acid  sequences share 99% similarity, were found to share sequence similarity  to the prophage mtases of l. lactis cv <dig>  and kf <dig> , and 22% aa identity to the mtase mboiia . amino acid alignments of the above-mentioned putative mtases with mboiia and kpni  identified several of the motifs associated with methyltransferases, and based on the order they occur , m.phi145i and m.phi93i are believed to belong to the type ii-encoding genes, group β mtases    <cit> .table  <dig>

hhpred analysis of m.phi93dam showed that this  mtase shares 63% aa identity to the s. aureus prophage l54a-encoded putative n- <dig> adenine mtase . using rebase it was predicted that mtphi93-dam encodes a putative dam mtase, recognising the motif 5′-gatc-3′, however, and in contrast to other dam mtases, m.phi93dam was found to only harbour a single conserved mtase motif, asn-pro-pro-tyr   <cit> .

individual orfs located within the replication regions of the phi <dig>  phi <dig> and phi <dig> genomes   , designated here as mtphi145- <dig>  mtphi93- <dig>  and mtphi15- <dig>  respectively, were also found to encode proteins  predicted to specify  mtases based on blastp, rebase and hhpred analysis . these putative  mtases are not unique to the phage sequenced in this study as they were also found to appear in several other 936-type phages such as ascc <dig>  and caseusjm <dig>   <cit> . amino acid alignments with the e. coli t <dig> phage mtase  identified these orfs as group α type ii n- <dig> mtases based on the presence of several of the conserved motifs associated with this group and the particular order they occur in  . these three phage-encoded mtases lacked motif vii and had only one conserved residue for motifs iii, vi and viii  <cit>  . while all four mtases did not harbour all nine conserved mtase motifs, typically observed in group α type ii n- <dig> mtases, variations in motifs have been seen before such as in hhaii  in which motif iv is represented as dpqyr instead of n/dppyn. type ii mtases are often associated with a cognate restriction endonucleases making up type ii r-ms in lactococcal strains which play an important role in protecting these strains from phage infection  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that lytic lactococcal phages have the ability to acquire functional mtases as shown for phi- <dig> which possesses the nucleotide sequence encoding an amino domain, llapi, from the r-m llai, identical to that on the plasmid ptr <dig>  <cit> . it is believed that the mtases identified in this study are  mtases as they do not appear to be associated with a cognate restriction endonuclease which may have occurred due to the negative impact a restriction endonuclease may have on the phage dna or that the amount of additional genomic information that can be acquired in the region of the phage genome may be limited, i.e. there is no selective advantage in acquiring the restriction endonuclease component.figure  <dig>

acquisition of additional orfs by lytic phages may occur due to errors during phage dna packaging, and appears to be more frequently encountered in pac-type phages, which use the head-full packaging mechanism, due to the recognition of pseudo-pac sites on the host dna  <cit> . however, packaging of additional dna has also been shown for cos-type phages, such as  <dig> and slt, which have been shown to mobilise s. aureus pathogenicity islands  <cit> . the observed sequence similarity between the packaging module-associated mtase-encoding genes with sequences located within the prophage elements of l. lactis kf <dig> and cv <dig> may indicate a genetic exchange event either between the phage and a prophage sequence within the host genome, or between phage genomes during co-infection with a replicating temperate phage via non-homologous recombination. previous studies have shown that lactococcal strains encode type ii r-m systems  specifying dpni and dpnii isochizomers , and it is possible that phi <dig> acquired mtphi93-dam from a host harbouring such an r-m system  <cit> . these packaging module-associated mtase-encoding genes appear to be unique to the 936-type phages sequenced in this study. mtases have been implicated in several functions in phages, primarily that of providing protection against host-encoded endonucleases  <cit> , yet regulatory roles have also been proposed for those associated with the packaging genes in e. coli phage p <dig>  <cit> . gatc methylation has been shown to be required to ensure efficient packaging of the phage dna as loss of this methylation resulted in a reduction in progeny phage numbers. it is unlikely that the mtases identifed in this study fulfill a regulatory role, as there are no reported 936-type phages  that harbour  mtase-encoding genes between the large and small terminase-encoding genes. it is more plausible that the mtases represent an acquired defence whereby phage dna is methylated such that it will be protected from endonuclease activity that may be present in prospective hosts.

epigenomic analysis of phage dna reveals distinctive methylation profiles
to determine the methylation specificities of the predicted phage mtases, phi <dig> , phi <dig>  and phi <dig>  were subjected to smrt dna sequencing  <cit> , a real-time approach that allows for the detection of modified nucleotides  in the dna sequence based on the dna polymerase kinetics  <cit> . several methods are available to study dna methylation such as bisulphite treatment, hplc, and microarrays, although it is challenging to detect 6 ma methylation patterns using any of these methods  <cit> . a certain minimum sequencing coverage is necessary for methylome analysis and several recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of the use of smrt sequencing technology . the methylated motifs detected were all shown to represent adenine-specific methylation. genome-wide motif analysis resulted in the identification of several mtase recognition motifs with the same motifs detected on two separate sequencing runs . for both the phi <dig> and phi <dig> genomes, four distinctly different methylation motifs, 5′-ccc6ma-3′, 5′-gt6mag-3′, 5′-cy6mag-3′ and 5′-ggw6mag-3′ , were identified in the smrt sequencing data. in addition, the methylation motif 5′-g6matc-3′was identified for the phi <dig> genome, consistent with the presence of mtphi93-dam, which specifies a predicted dam mtase . this methylation motif was, as expected, not identified on the genome of either phi <dig> or phi <dig>  which do not harbour a predicted dam-specific  mtase. finally, a single methylation motif identified on the phi <dig> genome, 5′-cc6mag-3′, was identified on both smrt sequencing runs. as a result, it is tempting to assign this motif to the presumed methylation activity of the gene product of mtphi15- <dig>  which is located within the replication region of phi <dig>  a very similar motif was identified for phi <dig> and phi <dig>  5′-cy6mag-3′ , which is consistent with the high level of sequence similarity between the gene products of mtphi145- <dig>  mtphi93- <dig>  and mtphi15- <dig>  and which indicates that the replication module-associated mtases of these three phages are responsible for the 5′-cc6mag-3′ motif methylation.

mtases protect phage genomes from endonuclease activity
to determine whether the putative mtases encoded by the phage genomes provide a protective effect, restriction endonucleases were used to determine if their activity was blocked by active methylation of phage dna. the 5′-gatc-3′ specific enzymes dpnii  and dpni  were used to determine if the product of mtphi93-dam is indeed capable of protection of phi <dig> genomic dna against restriction that targets a gatc recognition sequence. as expected, phi <dig> genome dna was protected from restriction by dpnii, while no such protection was observed against dpni . in contrast, genomic dna of phi <dig>  which is not dam methylated , exhibited the opposite endonuclease-mediated pattern whereby the dna was restricted by dpnii and not by dpni .figure  <dig>

the methylation-sensitive, 5′-ggtga-3′-recognizing restriction enzyme hphi, which exhibits an overlapping target recognition sequence with the methylation motif 5′-ggwg6ma-3′ , was utilised to demonstrate that the protein products of mtphi145- <dig> and mtphi93- <dig> protected genomic dna of phages phi <dig> and phi <dig> against hphi-mediated restriction. as expected, phi <dig> and phi <dig> phage dna was not digested by hphi, while dna phi <dig> was clearly digested by this enzyme .

to unambiguously link predicted mtase-encoding genes to a specific methylation motif found on the investigated phage genomes, mtphi93-dam, mtphi145- <dig> and mtphi145- <dig> were individually cloned into the low copy plasmid pptpi and heterologous expression studies were performed using the nisin-inducible system  to determine if their encoded products had the ability to methylate plasmid dna and protect against restriction. the genomes of phi <dig> and phi <dig> contain identical genes encoding putative  mtases , therefore the phi145-associated genes and their encoded products, m.phi145i and m.phi145ii, were used as representatives for these phage-associated mtases.

pptpi derivatives were constructed to generate ppim.93dam , ppim <dig>   and ppim <dig>   under the control of a nisin inducible promoter. following the growth of nz <dig> harbouring ppim.93dam with and without nisin, plasmid dna was restricted with both dpni and dpnii. ppim.93dam dna isolated from nz <dig> following nisin induction was protected from digestion by dpnii, but restricted by dpni. the opposite effect was observed under conditions without nisin induction where plasmid dna was shown to be digested by dpnii and not by dpni. this shows that the plasmid-located gatc sites were methylated by the expressed gene product of mtphi93-dam and thus protected against digestion by dpnii .

using a similar approach, it was hypothesised that if either of the mtases encoded by the phi <dig> genome is associated with the methylation motifs mentioned above, it would protect this phage from hphi digestion. along with plasmid dna from the empty vector, pptpi, plasmid dna isolated from l. lactis nz <dig> strains, harbouring either ppim <dig>  or ppim <dig> , and grown in the presence or absence of nisin was restricted with hphi. restriction endonuclease digestions showed that dna of plasmid ppim <dig>  isolated from nz <dig> grown in the presence of nisin was protected from cleavage by hphi, whereas such dna was not protected when isolated from the same strain grown in the absence of nisin . the empty vector was digested, as expected, by hphi. since plasmid dna of ppim <dig>  isolated from nz <dig> following growth with and without nisin was not resistant to hphi cleavage, , it is tempting to ascribe the non-palindromic methylome motif, ’-ggwg6ma-3′ to the activity of the gene product of mtphi145- <dig> and by default, to that of mtphi93- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first reported use of smrt sequencing technology to identify mtases encoded by phage genomes and the first identification of functional mtases associated with the lactococcal 936-type phages . the protective effects provided by these proteins indicate that these particular isolates have aquired these mtase-encoding genes as an enhanced fitness mechanism. the phages were isolated from an undefined mixed starter culture environment , which may harbour an extensive array of r-m systems. due to the selection pressure being imposed on infecting phages by such systems, phages may have aquired these methyltransferases to defend themselves from host-encoded r-ms, a trait not previously observed in 936-type dairy phages. developments in the smrt sequencing platform and analysis tools has permitted a novel approach to defining methylation sites within phage and bacterial genomes and in this study has complemented traditional approaches to defining methylation activity. the acquisition of such genetic elements highlights the ever-changing nature and plasticity of these phage genomes and warrants continued genome sequence analysis of phages as novel genetic elements continue to emerge and enhance our understanding of phage evolutionary processes.
