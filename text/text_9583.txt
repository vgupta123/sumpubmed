BACKGROUND
the octamer motif  and its reverse complement  <cit>  are important cis-regulatory elements found in transcriptional control regions of ubiquitously expressed genes, such as histone h2b and small nuclear rnas , as well as cell-type specific genes, such as the immunoglobulin  heavy and light chain genes  <cit> . the oct transcription factors, which bind octamer motifs, are members of the pou  family of proteins which are characterized by a bipartite dna binding domain. the binding domain consists of two subdomains, the pou specific  domain and the pou homeodomain  that are joined by a linker region, whose flexibility allows recognition of the cognate octamer motif by binding to both faces of the dna  <cit> . the pou proteins can be grouped, based on the structure of their pou domains, into six or more classes  <cit>  pou transcription factors of class ii have been widely studied in the vertebrates, and members of this class have also been reported in ecdysozoan invertebrates such as drosophila  <cit> , and in the deuterostomate echinoderm strongylocentrotus purpuratus  <cit> , and the urochordate oikopleura dioica  <cit> . in the vertebrates, oct <dig>  and oct <dig>  are the most widely studied class ii pou transcription factors. both oct <dig> and oct <dig> are essential transcription factors, with oct <dig> gene knockout in mouse being embryonic lethal  <cit>  and oct <dig> knockout resulting in death shortly after birth  <cit> .

while oct <dig> is involved in directing the transcription of both pol ii and pol iii genes, oct <dig> was originally thought to have a more restricted role, for example in controlling ig gene transcription in b cells  <cit> . however, subsequent studies  <cit>  suggested that oct <dig> is redundant, because oct <dig> can also play a significant role in the transcription of mammalian ig genes. depletion studies in hela cells and bja-b cells indicated that both oct <dig> and oct <dig> could drive transcription from the igh promoter in either cell line and with nearly identical binding activity  <cit> . in order to explain the evidence that transcription of both ubiquitously expressed and cell type restricted genes could be regulated by oct <dig> or oct <dig>  the idea of a b cell specific co-activator arose. the discovery of bob. <dig> , a b cell specific co-activator of oct <dig> and oct <dig> proteins, was thought to provide the answer  <cit> . however, thorough exploration of mouse b cell development and function in the absence of oct <dig> <cit> , oct <dig>  <cit>  or bob. <dig> <cit> , or a combination of oct <dig> and bob. <dig> <cit> , showed surprisingly little effect on ighm gene transcription. some effects were noticed in the production of secondary isotypes  and in the formation of germinal centers. thus, although the details of the mechanisms controlling the expression of ig genes in mammalian b-cells remain unclear, neither oct <dig> nor oct <dig> are essential transcription factors for this function, and the potential for comparative studies to shed light on the essential and evolutionarily-conserved aspects of ig gene transcription is considerable.

the channel catfish provides a system for studying the transcriptional control of teleost ig genes, particularly with respect to the heavy chain  locus where octamer motifs and octamer-binding transcription factors have been shown to play important roles  <cit> . catfish express only two classes of immunoglobulin  and class switching by chromosomal recombination is absent  <cit> . a single enhancer, eμ3', has been found associated with the expressed ighm <dig> and ighd <dig> genes of the catfish  <cit>  and is situated immediately 3' of the ighm <dig> gene. the core region of this enhancer consists of two variant  octamer motifs and a μe <dig> site. it has been previously established that octamer-binding transcription factors are important in driving transcription from the catfish eμ3' enhancer  <cit> . this situation in the catfish differs from what is seen with the mammalian igh locus, where the eμ enhancer is located 5' of the constant region gene cluster and contains a single octamer motif, which is not within the core enhancer  <cit> . catfish oct <dig> has been cloned and shown to be expressed as two predominant isoforms, oct2α and β, derived from a single gene by alternative rna processing. both catfish oct <dig> isoforms are transcriptionally active  <cit> , although the β isoform is a more potent transactivator than oct2α due to differences in the c-terminal proline, serine, threonine rich activation domains of the two isoforms  <cit> . while the role of catfish oct <dig> in transcriptional control of the igh locus of the channel catfish is well understood, the functional significance of other oct transcription factors has not yet been determined. the study reported here was undertaken to clone the catfish orthologue of oct <dig>  and to characterize its expression and function in driving transcription of the igh locus in b cells.

RESULTS
identification of an oct <dig> orthologue in channel catfish
a cdna library from a catfish monocyte cell line  was screened with a 32p-labeled probe for the pou domain of catfish oct <dig> , and a full-length clone with putative homology to vertebrate oct <dig> was identified. an amino acid sequence alignment of oct <dig> genes can be found in fig 1a. from the alignment a schematic of the inferred structure of catfish oct <dig> was made and is shown in fig 1b. the amino acid alignment confirmed the high level of conservation within the pou specific domain and the pou homeodomain . the putative activation domains n- and c-terminal to the pou domain also showed substantial sequence identity, ranging between 36% and 46% in comparison with the mouse and zebrafish oct <dig> activation domains. a more comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary relationships of catfish oct <dig> is shown in the phylogenetic tree of fig 1c. this demonstrates that the separation into oct <dig> and oct <dig> occurred early in vertebrate evolution, and that the invertebrate oct genes form an outgroup and cannot be classified clearly as either oct <dig> or oct <dig> othologues  <cit> . although isoforms of catfish oct <dig> have easily been identified  <cit> , analysis by rt-pcr and race-pcr of cdna from catfish b cell and t cell lines  did not identify any sequences of catfish oct <dig> other than the one originally isolated .

catfish oct <dig> is widely expressed
ubiquitous expression in cells and tissues is one of the key features that distinguishes mammalian oct <dig> from the tissue-restricted oct <dig>  therefore, the expression of catfish oct <dig> in clonal t and b cell lines and in a variety of tissues was analyzed by rt-pcr . the primers used in the rt- pcr analysis were designed within the c-terminus of the catfish oct <dig> to distinguish the oct <dig> gene from the two isoforms of catfish oct <dig>  the primer sequences were not found within the sequence for either isoform of catfish oct <dig> and ncbi blast search returned matches only to the catfish oct <dig> sequence. the cloned, catfish b and t cell lines both expressed oct <dig>  as did all of the tissues examined, including spleen, head and trunk kidney, brain, heart, gill and intestine. this pattern of widespread expression is consistent with its mammalian counterparts, and with the expectation that it would play a significant role in gene regulation. thus, the ability of catfish oct <dig> to drive expression from a variety of octamer-containing reporter constructs was tested.

transcriptional activity of catfish oct1
an oct <dig> expression vector was co-transfected, with several different reporter constructs, all of which contained octamer motifs, into catfish b cell lines. oct <dig> was, surprisingly, unable to drive transcription from an octamer-dependent reporter that contains a trimer of octamer motifs upstream of a minimal c-fos promoter, and which is responsive to catfish oct <dig> . whilst the transcription driven by the transfected oct <dig> was actually found to be significantly suppressive  from the empty vector control, catfish oct <dig>  as predicted, induced transcription strongly. we considered the possibility that oct <dig> requires a co-activator to function, and thus examined its ability to act in concert with human bob. <dig>  a co-activator of oct transcription factors. bob. <dig> has previously been shown to activate transcription synergistically with catfish oct <dig>  <cit>  but as shown in fig 3b, human bob. <dig> was unable to act synergistically with catfish oct <dig>  this was not due to a lack of function of bob. <dig>  as it enhanced transcription  from the octamer-dependent reporter when transfected alone into catfish b cells, presumably through interaction with the endogenous oct transcription factors. the interaction of human bob. <dig> with catfish oct <dig> gave transcription that was increased above the level seen with either bob. <dig> or oct <dig> transfected alone . whilst this interactive effect of bob. <dig> on oct2-driven transcription did not reach statistical significance , in a second series of experiments  this effect was confirmed . the possibility that catfish oct <dig> and oct <dig> might act synergistically was tested in a series of co-transfection experiments. the results  showed that the transcriptional activation produced by catfish oct <dig> was in fact reduced  with increasing amounts of co-transfected oct <dig>  in order to test if the inability of catfish oct <dig> to drive transcription was reporter-dependent, its activity was tested on two other physiologically-relevant reporter constructs. the ability of catfish oct <dig> to drive transcription from a reporter construct containing a minimal promoter and the core region of the enhancer  of the catfish igh locus was tested in both mouse j558l plasmacytoma cells and in the catfish b cell line 1g <dig>  the results show that this reporter, while responsive to catfish oct <dig>  was unresponsive to oct <dig> both in mouse  and catfish  cells. the activation by catfish oct <dig> was statistically significant  activation by catfish oct <dig> was not. when catfish oct <dig> and human bob. <dig> were co-transfected, the level of transcriptional activation was no higher than that seen with bob. <dig> alone , confirming the inability of catfish oct <dig> to interact positively with this co-activator. co-transfection of human bob. <dig> with catfish oct <dig> enhanced transcription to a statistically significant extent, supporting the effect suggested by the results shown in fig 3b. the activity of catfish oct <dig> was then tested with a third octamer-containing reporter construct, in which expression is driven from a fish vh gene promoter that contains a single octamer motif . while this construct was highly responsive to oct <dig>  it failed to respond to co-transfected oct <dig>  and these results were also found to be statistically significant. given these unexpected results, the possibilities were next considered that catfish oct <dig> was either a) unable to bind to an octamer motif or b) if it could bind to an octamer motif, it lacked functional activation domains.

in vitro expressed catfish oct <dig> binds the octamer motif
in order to test the ability of catfish oct <dig> to bind to the octamer motif, catfish oct2β and catfish oct <dig> proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and translation and tested by emsa for their ability to bind the native octamer motif  found within the catfish core enhancer . the first two lanes of the gel shift show the free probe  and the tnt lysate  without the addition of any dna as controls. these results show that oct <dig> bound to the octamer motif , and that the binding was specifically inhibited by an excess of unlabeled octamer motif  but not by an excess of the octamer sequence that had been scrambled . addition of the antibody to catfish oct <dig> eliminated the shifted band , indicating that the observed shift was oct1-induced. the control  serum did not affect the observed shift . the ability of catfish oct2β to bind to the native octamer motif was confirmed by the results  which are similar to those observed with catfish oct <dig>  the in vitro synthesized proteins were checked for size by radiolabeling with 35s methionine and analyzed on an sds page gel . the sizes of the protein bands produced for catfish oct <dig> and oct2β were consistent with the expected sizes of the proteins, 65kda for catfish oct <dig> and 52kda for catfish oct2β.

octamer-binding transcription factors of catfish b cells
the ability of endogenous transcription factors expressed in catfish b cells to bind the octamer motif was also tested by emsa. nuclear extracts from the catfish 1g <dig> b cell line generated complex patterns of shifted bands when tested with a consensus octamer motif . however, all the shifted bands were abolished by an excess of unlabeled octamer motif , but not by the addition of a scrambled octamer motif  and interpretation of the banding pattern was made possible using antisera specific to oct <dig> and to oct <dig>  the uppermost shifted band is clearly attributable to oct <dig>  as seen from the supershift of this band in the presence of antibody to oct <dig> . below this oct <dig> shift is an envelope of strong bands attributable to oct <dig>  as evidenced by their supershift with antibody to oct <dig> . antibody to oct <dig> failed to supershift a faint band within this lower oct <dig> envelope, but the combination of antibody to oct <dig> and to oct <dig> supershifted all bands in the upper region of the gel . the nature of the lower, diffuse bands observed in the emsa is not known, but they were not supershifted by the antibodies to either oct <dig> or oct <dig> .

catfish oct <dig> lacks functional activation domains
the above results clearly demonstrate that catfish oct <dig> is capable of binding to the octamer motif. thus, in order to address the failure of catfish oct <dig> to activate transcription, the function of the n- and c-terminal putative activation domains was tested. expression constructs containing the gal <dig> dna binding domain fused to oct <dig> and oct <dig> putative activation domains were generated, and tested by co-transfection with a reporter constructs containing gal <dig> binding sites in the promoter region . these constructs were co-transfected into catfish b cells  and their ability to drive transcription from the reporter construct is shown in table  <dig>  the negative controls  were inactive or suppressive, whereas the positive control  showed strong statistically significant activity. the c-terminal domain of the catfish oct2β isoform was also strongly active and statistically significant, giving a greater than 300-fold stimulation of expression. there was low activation  seen with the n-terminus of catfish oct2β; this level of activity is consistent with what has previously been reported and nearly statistically significant with a p-value of . <dig> <cit> . however, in the case of catfish oct <dig>  both the c-terminal and n-terminal domains are lacking in substantial activation ability . while there was a slight activation  with the c terminal domain, this activation was negligible and not statistically significant when compared to that of the catfish oct2β c-terminus. in the case of the n-terminal domain of oct <dig>  it suppressed rather than enhanced transcription, this suppression was also seen to be significant from the dna binding domain alone. examination of the oct <dig> sequence alignment in figure  <dig> shows the lack of several gln residues known to be important in the n-terminal activation domain of mammalian oct <dig> <cit> . within the gln <dig> region , which is located in the human oct <dig> sequence from amino acid 22– <dig>  52% of the gln residues found in the human sequence are missing in catfish oct <dig> and 68% are missing in the zebrafish oct <dig> sequence. in the gln <dig> region , 42% of the gln residues are missing in the catfish and 58% are missing in the zebrafish oct <dig>  the absence of these gln residues suggests that teleost oct <dig> may not possess the capability to act as a transcriptional regulator. further examination of the ser/thr rich region  <cit>  located from amino acid 441– <dig> in human oct <dig> indicates a similar pattern, i.e. 67% and 69% of ser and thr residues present in the human sequence are absent in the homologous regions of catfish and zebrafish oct <dig>  respectively.

discussion
the conclusion that the cloned catfish molecule identified in this study is a homologue of oct <dig> is supported by  <dig> observations. first, it shows well-conserved sequence similarity to other vertebrate oct <dig> ; secondly, in phylogenetic analyses it clusters to the same tree branch as other vertebrate oct <dig> sequences; thirdly, it binds the octamer dna sequence motif; and fourthly, it shows the widespread pattern of expression characteristic of vertebrate oct <dig>  in human and mouse several isoforms of oct <dig> have been isolated, arising from alternative splicing involving the  <dig> expressed exons of this gene,  <cit> . in contrast, examination of catfish macrophage and b cell lines by rt-pcr and race failed to identify any alternatively spliced isoforms of catfish oct <dig>  however, emsa analysis of endogenous octamer-binding transcription factors  suggested the possibility that an additional minor isoform of oct <dig> might be expressed in catfish b cells. it is possible a) that an oct <dig> isoform may be expressed at such a low level that the technique used may have failed to detect its presence or b) the primers designed for this study may have been placed in exons not included in the transcript. analysis of the teleost fish genomes currently being sequenced revealed orthologues of the oct <dig> in the zebrafish danio rerio, , the puffer fishes takifugu rubripes  and tetraodon nigroviridis , and the three-spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus . interestingly, in only one of these species, the stickleback is oct <dig> reported to have more than one transcript. thus, despite the whole genome duplication that occurred in teleost fishes, to date no evidence for more than a single oct <dig> gene has been found. while it is likely that only one oct <dig> gene exists in the teleost fishes  this question will not be resolved until the sequencing and assembly of the teleost genome sequences is completed

although orthologues of oct <dig> are present in the genomes of four other teleost fish this study represents the first examination of the function of a teleost oct <dig> orthologue. contrary to our expectations, catfish oct <dig> was clearly unable to activate transcription, even though it binds to the octamer motif. this inability to drive transcription was seen using three different octamer-containing reporter constructs transfected into both mouse and catfish b cells. not only did the catfish oct <dig> fail to activate transcription from a reporter construct with a synthetic trimer of octamer motifs in the promoter region, but it also failed to activate transcription from two constructs driven by physiologically-relevant octamer-containing elements; in one case a complete fish vh promoter  <cit> , and in the other case the core region of the eμ3' enhancer of the channel catfish igh locus  <cit> . in all cases, while the catfish oct <dig> drove transcription from the reporter constructs to a statistically significant level, catfish oct <dig> did not. binding of both native and in vitro expressed catfish oct <dig> was shown with both the consensus octamer motif  or the variant octamer motif  located within the core region of the catfish enhancer eμ3'. to dissect the molecular basis for the lack of transcriptional activation of catfish oct <dig>  a gal <dig> fusion study of the putative activation domains was undertaken. the results of this study clearly demonstrate the lack of activity of the putative activation domains in both the n- and c-terminus of the catfish oct <dig> possibly associated with the relative lack of residues known to be associated with activation domain function, i.e. gln residues in the n-terminal domain and ser and thr residues in the c-terminal domain of catfish oct  <dig>  co-transfection studies involving catfish oct <dig> and oct <dig> suggested that catfish oct <dig> could be a negative regulator of transcription, in that it significantly inhibited activation driven by oct <dig>  the mammalian co-activator bob. <dig> has been shown to act synergistically with both mammalian oct <dig> and oct <dig> to drive transcription  <cit> , and the possibility was considered that this co-activator might rescue the activation function of catfish oct <dig>  however, while co-transfection studies confirmed that human bob. <dig> is capable of significantly enhancing transcriptional activation driven by catfish oct2β , bob. <dig> did not confer transcriptional activation ability on catfish oct <dig>  the failure of bob. <dig> and catfish oct <dig> to function in a synergistic manner could result from impaired physical interaction between bob. <dig> and catfish oct <dig>  however, the bob.1/oct interaction is through the oct pou domain  <cit>  which is the most highly conserved region of the catfish oct <dig> molecule . all of the residues in the mammalian oct <dig> pou domains that are known to interact with bob. <dig>  including leu <dig>  glu <dig>  leu <dig>  glu <dig>  leu <dig>  asn <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig> within the pous domain and lys <dig>  arg <dig>  ile <dig> within the pouh domain  <cit>  are conserved in catfish oct <dig>  this suggests the possibility that catfish oct <dig> might function in concert with endogenous co-activators, such as a catfish homologue of bob. <dig>  however, if this were the case, transcriptional activation by oct <dig> expressing constructs transfected into catfish b cells would have been predicted. these results suggest, collectively, a potential mechanism of transcriptional control in the catfish igh locus whereby oct <dig>  as a negative regulator of transcription and oct <dig>  as an activator of transcription compete for binding to the octamer motifs found within the intronic enhancer  and the vh promoters  <cit> .

mammalian oct <dig> is involved in driving transcription from both pol ii and pol iii promoters and also has a role in recruiting basal transcription factors such as snapc  <cit> . in addition, mammalian oct <dig> demonstrates promoter-selective activation domains and its ability to drive mrna transcription can be weaker than that of oct <dig>  <cit> . while mammalian oct <dig> has not been reported to act as a negative regulator of ig gene transcription, its very diverse functions in regulating the expression of other genes include both positive and negative effects. in the case of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor  gene, oct <dig> has been shown to be capable of both activation and repression  <cit> . the pou domain of oct <dig> interacts with the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors , recruiting histone deacetylases to the promoter and leading to transcriptional repression  <cit> . two more recent studies have indicated additional roles for oct <dig>  mouse embryo fibroblast  cell lines depleted of oct <dig> showed an arrest in herpes simplex virus replication, due to a role for oct <dig> in aiding viral assembly as well as a likely secondary role affecting viral dna replication  <cit> . a recent study of gene expression has also indicated that oct <dig> can act as a stress sensor. mouse fibroblasts deficient in oct <dig> showed altered expression in a variety of genes known to be involved in the response to oxidative and metabolical stress  <cit> . in both of these cases the dna binding ability of oct <dig> is critical.

CONCLUSIONS
the study reported here is the first demonstration that an oct <dig> protein has an inhibitory effect on the transcriptional regulatory elements of ig genes. however, given that mammalian oct <dig> has multiple and diverse roles, it is possible that oct <dig> in teleosts has significantly different roles from those seen in mammals, relating not only to the transcription of genes but to the response to cellular stress and viral infection.
