BACKGROUND
many proteins that transit through the secretory pathway require disulfide bonds to stabilize their native functional conformation. disulfide bond formation in secretory proteins primarily occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum , and is mediated by members of the protein disulfide isomerase  family. the classical pdi  is a versatile enzyme capable of catalyzing the oxidation, reduction, or isomerization of disulfide bonds in a wide range of substrate proteins in vitro  <cit> , and can also assist in protein folding as a molecular chaperone  <cit> . the classical pdi structure consists of four modular domains in the arrangement a-b-b’-a’, where a and a’ are catalytic domains sharing homology to thioredoxin  <cit> . the catalytic domains contain a redox-active vicinal dithiol comprised of two cysteines separated by two amino acids . in contrast, the b and b’ domains lack sequence homology to thioredoxin, but possess the βαβαβαββα thioredoxin structural fold  <cit> , with the b’ domain serving as the principle binding site for misfolded proteins  <cit> . in the case of the pancreas-specific human pdi homolog, pdia <dig>  the b-b’ region is associated with chaperone activity  <cit> .

although pdis with the a-b-b’-a’ structure are conserved across animals, plants and yeasts, there is a diverse assortment of pdi-like proteins that deviate from this arrangement. terrestrial plants encode six structurally divergent pdi subfamilies, designated as a, b, c, l, m and s  <cit> . the  <dig> total pdis of the model dicot, arabidopsis thaliana, comprise six isoforms of pdi-l, three isoforms of pdi-c, two isoforms of pdi-m, and a single isoform each of pdi-a, pdi-b, and pdi-s. while the functions of most arabidopsis pdi proteins have not been elucidated, there is growing evidence that several pdis have evolved to take on distinct roles in plant growth and development. members of the pdi-l subfamily  share the a-b-b’-a’ arrangement of classical pdis and primarily localize to the er  <cit> , although pdi <dig> is also present in protein storage vacuoles  <cit> , pdi <dig> in chloroplasts  <cit> , and pdi <dig> in both vacuoles and the nucleus  <cit> . whereas pdi <dig> influences embryo development by chaperoning and inhibiting cysteine  proteases involved in programmed cell death  <cit> , its sister paralog pdi <dig> was implicated as a modulator of photoinhibition  <cit> . pdi <dig> interacts with both the er resident chaperone, bip, and the nuclear transcription factor, mee <dig> , and is highly expressed in seeds, suggesting an involvement in embryo/seed development  <cit> .

pdi-m and pdi-s isoforms contain two catalytic a-type domains, but without the intervening redox-inactive b-type domains found in pdi-l isoforms  <cit> . pdi-m isoforms have an a0-a-b domain arrangement and are co-orthologs of mammalian pdia <dig>  <cit> , while pdi-s isoforms have an a0-a-d arrangement, where d represents a conserved all α-helical domain of unknown function  <cit> . arabidopsis isoforms of pdi-m  and pdi-s  both localize to the er  <cit> , with the pdi-m isoforms accumulating within microdomains of the er known as er bodies  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the expression of truncated versions of pdi <dig> disrupts both pollen tube guidance and embryo sac development  <cit> .

two striking examples of pdis that deviate from the classical a-b-b’-a’ domain arrangement are the pdi-b and pdi-c sub-families. unlike the majority of the pdi family, pdi-b and pdi-c are predicted to contain one or two transmembrane domains , respectively  <cit> . although pdi-b and pdi-c are both putative transmembrane pdis, they contain unique structural features that set them apart from each other. pdi-c isoforms possess a single catalytic a domain, flanked on both ends by sequences homologous to yeast erv41p and erv46p  <cit> , which have recently been implicated as cargo receptors for the retrieval of er proteins lacking the traditional yeast er retention signal, hdel  <cit> . by contrast, pdi-b isoforms possess an a-b-b’ domain arrangement that is reminiscent of classical pdi structure, but pdi-b isoforms lack a second catalytic  domain and instead possess a c-terminal tmd  <cit> . pdi-b and pdi-c isoforms have not been experimentally characterized to date. the pdi-b subfamily is represented by a single member in arabidopsis, pdi <dig> . here we describe the characterization of the membrane orientation, expression, sub-cellular localization, and biochemical function of this novel member of the pdi family.

RESULTS
domain architecture and sequence characteristics of pdi8
the arabidopsis pdi <dig> gene contains five exons and encodes a deduced polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . the first  <dig> amino acids of the deduced pdi <dig> sequence are predicted by signalp- <dig>  to serve as a cleavable signal peptide , with the resulting mature pdi <dig> protein having a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and a theoretical pi of  <dig> . pdi <dig> is predicted by tmhmm v.  <dig>  to contain a single tmd, spanning residues 378- <dig> of the pdi <dig> preprotein sequence. secondary structure prediction of the pdi <dig> preprotein by spider <dig> revealed an alternating pattern of α-helices and β-strands, including three intervals with the thioredoxin structural fold, βαβαβαββα . protein domains belonging to the thioredoxin fold class are identified on the basis of their secondary structural elements, rather than actual sequence homology to the cytoplasmic redox protein, thioredoxin  <cit> . despite their predicted structural resemblance to thioredoxin, the three thioredoxin-fold domains of pdi <dig> do not share significant sequence homology to each other, and only the first domain  shares homology to canonical thioredoxin proteins.fig.  <dig> domain arrangement of pdi <dig>  a the secondary structure of pdi <dig>  positions of α-helices  and β-strands  are based on prediction by spider <dig>  the thioredoxin-fold domains , and predicted signal peptide  and tmd of pdi <dig> are boxed. each thioredoxin fold consists of  <dig> β-strands and  <dig> α-helices , in the arrangement β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-β5-α <dig>  b comparison of the domain organizations of homo sapiens tmx <dig> and arabidopsis pdi <dig>  showing the relative positions of the sp, tmd, and domains a, b and b’. pdi8abb’ and pdi8bb’ represent truncated forms of pdi <dig> used in this study



by convention, pdi redox-active thioredoxin-fold domains are referred to as a domains, while redox-inactive thioredoxin-fold domains are termed b domains  <cit> . the n-terminal-most thioredoxin-fold domain of pdi <dig> is an a-type domain sharing 42 % and 35 % sequence identity with the a and a’ domains of human pdi, respectively, and contains the cghc redox active site motif found in the a and a’ domains of the classical pdis from human and yeast. the other two thioredoxin-fold domains of pdi <dig> do not contain any potentially redox-active cys residues, and were thus designated as b-type domains . blast searches of the arabidopsis tair <dig> protein database indicated that the b and b’ domains of pdi <dig> do not share significant homology to other proteins from arabidopsis, including the b and b’ domains of other members of the pdi family. furthermore, although pdi <dig> shares a similar domain arrangement to human thioredoxin-related membrane protein  <dig> , no homology was found at the amino acid level between the b-type domains of pdi <dig> and tmx <dig> in pairwise sequence similarity comparisons using the blast algorithm.

consistent with prior genomic analyses of the plant pdi family  <cit> , we identified at least one ortholog of pdi <dig> among all monocot and dicot species surveyed, as well as among the model bryophyte physcomitrella patens and the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii, while no pdi <dig> ortholog was evident among the genomes of representative chlorophyte green algae species . blast searches using the unique bb’ region of arabidopsis pdi <dig> also failed to identify any orthologs of pdi <dig> among non-plant species, indicating that the pdi-b subfamily is specific to plants. nearly all monocot and dicot pdi <dig> orthologs possess the classical pdi dithiol active site sequence, cghc, although one of the two pdi <dig> orthologs from populus trichocarpa contains the non-classical variant cthc. only non-classical variants of the cxxc motif were present in the pdi <dig> orthologs from physcomitrella  and selaginella . the c-terminus of arabidopsis pdi <dig> ends with the sequence kked  <cit> , which resembles the kkxx or xkxx tetrapeptide signal for er retrieval of transmembrane proteins via copi-coated vesicles. comparison of the c-termini of pdi <dig> orthologs revealed that all dicot orthologs and the two orthologs from physcomitrella shared the c-terminal motif, xkxd, while monocot pdi <dig> orthologs possessed the c-terminal motif xhx.table  <dig> representation of the pdi-b subfamily in plants

pdi <dig> promoter expression analysis using the gus reporter system
to examine the spatial expression pattern of pdi <dig> in planta, we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring the ~ <dig> -kb region immediately upstream of the pdi <dig> start codon  transcriptionally fused to the reporter gene, β-glucuronidase . a total of  <dig> independent transgenic lines were analyzed to establish the consensus expression pattern of the pdi8pro:gus fusion in seedlings and flowering plants. histological staining of 7-day-old seedlings revealed strong expression of the gus transgene in the emerging first true leaves, cotyledons, roots, and the base of the hypocotyl . in cotyledons, gus staining was primarily detected in the vasculature and guard cells . in roots, gus staining was observed exclusively in the vasculature, both at the mature zone  and the root tip . the staining pattern of 14-day-old pdi8pro:gus plants  was similar to that of 7-day-old seedlings, although gus staining in older  leaves was primarily confined to the vasculature , whereas strong gus staining was observed throughout younger  leaves . however, we did not observe significant gus staining at the shoot apical meristem .fig.  <dig> expression pattern of the pdi8

in 6-week-old reproductive-stage plants, expression of the pdi8pro:gus transgene was detected at the style, and in the vasculature of petals, sepals and stamen filaments . strong gus expression was also present in pedicels, although the pedicels of older flowers exhibited decreased gus staining near the pedicel/flower junction . we also detected significant gus expression in siliques , and the pedicel/stem junction .

the expression pattern of pdi <dig> was also examined by mining publicly-available microarray data through the bio-analytic resource eplant browser . consistent with our gus reporter expression analyses, pdi <dig> transcripts were detected across many plant tissues, including roots, leaves, flowers and siliques . the highest mean expression values corresponded to expanding siliques, heart and globular-stage embryos, pedicels, 24 h imbibed seeds, and the 2nd internode of the inflorescence stem, while the lowest mean expression value corresponded to mature pollen.

pdi <dig> localizes primarily to the er
the subcellular localization pattern of pdi <dig> was examined using two different approaches: 1) transient expression of a pdi <dig> fusion to the green fluorescent protein variant, gfp, in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, and 2) detection of native pdi <dig> in wild-type arabidopsis ultra-thin sections by transmission immunoelectron microscopy. for the first approach, since pdi <dig> potentially contains both a signal peptide at its n-terminus and an er retrieval signal at its c-terminus, we generated two constructs expressing gfp at different positions relative to the pdi <dig> open reading frame . in the spgfp-pdi <dig> fusion, gfp is positioned internally between the signal peptide and mature peptide sequences of pdi <dig>  in the pdi8-gfp-kked, gfp is positioned at the c-terminus of the pdi <dig>  with the c-terminus of gfp modified to include the putative er retention sequence of pdi <dig>  kked. when transiently co-expressed in protoplasts with a marker for the er, both the spgfp-pdi <dig> and pdi8-gfp-kked fusions exhibited a subcellular distribution pattern that strongly overlapped with that of the network-like localization pattern of the er-mcherry, whereas unfused gfp displayed a distribution pattern that was noticeably more diffuse than the er-mcherry marker .fig.  <dig> gfp fusions to pdi <dig> localize to the er. a position of gfp within the fusions spgfp-pdi <dig> and pdi8-gfp-kked. b transient co-expression of the er-mcherry marker with unfused gfp , the spgfp-pdi <dig> construct , or the pdi8-gfp-kked construct . gfp signal is shown in column  <dig>  mcherry signal in column  <dig>  and a merge of both signal patterns in column  <dig>  the scale bar in each panel represents 5 μm



to facilitate the higher-resolution subcellular localization of pdi <dig>  a pdi8-specific polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against a truncated version of pdi <dig> containing the b-b’ region  of the protein. the reactivity and specificity of the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum was examined by immunoblot analysis against recombinant pdi8bb’, and against total protein samples extracted from 7-day-old wild-type  arabidopsis seedlings and transgenic plants expressing the pdi <dig> cdna under the strong constitutive camv 35s promoter in either the sense orientation  or antisense orientation. the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum strongly detected the recombinant pdi8bb’ protein , and a protein with a mw of ~54 kda in both wt and 35spro:pdi <dig> lines . the 54-kda protein was detected very strongly in 35spro:pdi <dig> overexpression lines relative to wt, indicating that this protein corresponds to pdi <dig> in plants. we did not observe any phenotype associated with either overexpression or antisense suppression of pdi <dig>  however, analysis of transcript levels in the pdi <dig> antisense lines by quantitative reverse transcription pcr  showed that the endogenous pdi <dig> gene was only partially suppressed in these lines , indicating that the obtained antisense lines were not true knockouts .

for a high resolution analysis of the localization pattern of native pdi <dig>  we prepared specimens for immunogold labeling from the shoot and root apices of wild-type arabidopsis seedlings using high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution. after sectioning the specimens, they were labeled with the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum, followed by secondary labeling with a gold-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum. in shoot apical cells, prominent labeling of the er by the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum was observed . this antiserum also labeled the er in root apical cells . we did not detect significant anti-pdi <dig> labeling of any other sub-cellular structures. no labeling was observed using the pre-immune serum on sections from wild-type seedlings nor using the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum on the antisense line . thus, the er labeling observed using the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum  was specifically detecting pdi <dig>  sections from 35spro:pdi <dig> overexpression lines labeled with the anti-pdi <dig> antiserum displayed strong labeling of the er, indicating that the overexpression of pdi <dig> in plants does not lead to mislocalization of the protein .fig.  <dig> detection of native pdi <dig> specifically at the er by immunoelectron microscopy. tem analysis was performed on sections taken from the shoot apex , and the root apex , after primary labeling with rabbit anti-pdi <dig> antiserum and secondary labeling with  <dig> or 15 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg antibodies . labeling was detected at the endoplasmic reticulum 



pdi <dig> is a type i integral membrane protein
to further the molecular characterization of pdi <dig>  the orientation of the pdi <dig> protein in microsomal membranes was investigated. since overexpression of pdi <dig> under the camv 35s promoter does not lead to mislocalization of pdi <dig> in stably transformed plants , or when transiently expressed in mesophyll protoplasts in the form of the spgfp-pdi <dig> or pdi8-gfp-kked fusions , microsomes were prepared from 35spro:pdi <dig> plants due to the strong pdi <dig> signal these lines exhibited on immunoblots. separation of the 35spro:pdi <dig> protein sample into soluble and microsomal membrane protein fractions revealed that pdi <dig> was exclusively associated with the microsomal membrane fraction . the microsomes were also tested for the presence of a microsomal marker protein, the soluble er lumen protein, bip, by using a polyclonal antibody recognizing bip. bip was primarily found in the microsomal fraction , but a minor amount of bip was also detected in the soluble protein fraction, which presumably was due to the escape of some proteins from the er lumen during the mechanical fragmentation of the er network to produce microsomes. coomassie staining of an sds-page gel loaded with equivalent volumes of the total protein, soluble protein, and microsomal protein fractions demonstrated that the large subunit of rubisco  was present in both the total protein and soluble protein fractions in similar amounts, but was absent in the microsomal fraction .fig.  <dig> membrane orientation of pdi <dig>  a immunoblot analyses of proteins extracted from 35s

since pdi <dig> is predicted to contain a single tmd near its c-terminus, we sought to address whether the n-terminal a-b-b’ region of pdi <dig> was lumenal  or cytoplasmic . 35spro:pdi <dig> microsomal membranes were treated with proteinase k to ascertain if the pdi <dig> n-terminal region was located within the interior of microsomes, and would therefore be protected from degradation. as shown in fig. 5b, treatment of 35spro:pdi <dig> microsomes with protease caused a downward shift in the apparent mw of pdi <dig> to ~48 kda , while treatment with both protease and a detergent  to disrupt the microsomal membranes resulted in the complete degradation of pdi <dig> . treatment with detergent alone had no effect on the apparent mw of pdi <dig> . since the c-terminal tail of pdi <dig>  contributes a theoretical ~5 kda to the total mw of pdi <dig>  the observed minor decrease in the mw of pdi <dig> following proteinase k treatment is consistent with the c-terminal tail being located on the outside of microsomes. a model of the pdi <dig> polypeptide oriented in the er membrane is shown in fig. 5c, indicating that the catalytic domain  and thioredoxin fold domains  are oriented into the lumen of the er.

heterologous expression of pdi <dig> functionally complements the dsba− mutation in e. coli by reconstituting alkaline phosphatase activity
to gain further insight into the molecular function of pdi <dig>  we examined if pdi <dig> can functionally complement the e. coli oxidative protein folding mutant, dsba−. the e. coli thioredoxin-fold protein, dsba, plays a crucial role in the oxidative folding of proteins within the bacterial periplasm by catalyzing the formation  of protein disulfide bonds. loss-of-function mutations of dsba disrupt the proper folding of several proteins, including alkaline phosphatase , which in its native state is a homodimer containing two disulfide bonds in each of its subunits  <cit> . phoa activity is substantially reduced in a dsba− null mutant background, but can be restored by expressing human pdi in the periplasm of dsba− cells  <cit> .

to determine if pdi <dig> can likewise restore phoa activity in dsba− mutant cells, the coding sequence for the lumenal portion of pdi <dig>  was cloned into the bacterial expression vector, pflag-cts, between the vector sequences coding for the ompa signal peptide  and c-terminal flag epitope tag. the resulting plasmid, pflag-pdi8abb’, was transformed into e. coli strain ri <dig>  which harbors the dsba null mutation, dsbaa1::kan <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  phoa activity in the dsba− strain  or dsba− strain transformed with the pflag-cts empty vector  was substantially reduced relative to the isogenic wild-type  parental control strain ri <dig> , whereas dsba− cells expressing pdi8abb’ exhibited levels of phoa activity similar to that of wild-type dsba+ cells . thus, the lumenal portion of pdi <dig> can functionally substitute for the disulfide oxidase role of dsba in e coli.fig.  <dig> alkaline phosphatase activity of e. coli dsba

discussion
because of their conserved structure across eukaryotes, much research attention has focused on classical-type pdis containing the a-b-b’-a’ domain organization. in arabidopsis there are six pdis with the classical pdi domain arrangement, and each has been shown to localize to the er lumen  <cit> , although several classical-type pdi isoforms have been shown to also localize to other cellular structures, including protein storage vacuoles, chloroplasts and the nucleus, and to exhibit diverse functions as chaperones and protein foldases  <cit> . in addition, there are some pdis that deviate from the a-b-b’-a’ arrangement, although how these pdis differ functionally from classical pdis remains poorly understood.

in this report we describe pdi <dig>  which is the lone member of the novel pdi-b subfamily in arabidopsis. pdi <dig> possesses three striking differences that distinguishes it from classical pdis. first, whereas classical pdis possess both n-proximal  and c-proximal  thioredoxin catalytic domains, pdi <dig> only possesses a single, n-proximal a-type domain. second, although pdi <dig> contains two central redox-inactive b-type thioredoxin-fold domains, the bb’ region of pdi <dig> does not share sequence homology to the bb’ region of classical pdis. finally, whereas classical pdis are soluble er lumen proteins, pdi <dig> contains a tmd located near its c-terminus. although the domain arrangement of pdi <dig> is similar to that of mammalian tmx <dig>  sequence similarity between the two proteins is restricted to their catalytic a domains only, implying that they are not orthologous, but instead arose through separate evolutionary events. indeed, proteins sharing homology to the bb’ region of pdi <dig> were only identified in terrestrial plants, and not in representative chlorophyte green algae or non-plant species, indicating that the pdi-b subfamily most likely arose after the evolutionary split between chlorophytes and streptophytes .

based on the pdi8pro:gus fusion analysis, pdi <dig> is predicted to play a role in protein folding in young, emerging leaves, in stomata, and in the vasculature of older leaves, roots, and floral organs . recently, pdi <dig> transcripts were identified in a transcriptomic survey for mobile mrnas that undergo long-distance transport from shoots to roots  <cit> , and thus the pdi <dig> protein may be produced in plant tissues beyond those in which the pdi <dig> promoter is actively expressed. indeed, the pdi <dig> promoter expression pattern raises the interesting possibility that pdi <dig> is expressed in the vasculature specifically for the purpose of mobilizing pdi <dig> mrna to distant tissues via the plant vascular system, possibly to serve as a signal molecule for the coordination of growth processes or for adaptation to environmental stresses in distant plant organs  <cit> . the pdi <dig> antiserum developed in this study, combined with proteomic methods, provide an opportunity to investigate this hypothesis and elucidate the cell-specific expression profile in the plant.

to gain further insight into its function, we determined the subcellular location of pdi <dig>  using two different approaches, we demonstrated that pdi <dig> localizes to the er. in immunoelectron microscopy experiments using the pdi8-specific antiserum directed against b-b’ region, we observed strong labeling of the er in sections obtained from the shoot apices of wild-type arabidopsis seedlings , with less labeling in sections taken from the root apex . this immunolabeling pattern was consistent with the expression pattern of the reporter construct pdi8pro:gus, which exhibited strong expression near the shoot apex , but was not expressed at detectable levels in root tip cells . in addition, our analysis of the subcellular distribution patterns of spgfp-pdi <dig> and pdi8-gfp-kked in protoplasts indicated that both fusion proteins accumulated in the er as well . given that pdi <dig> contains a potential kkxx-type er retrieval sequence, it is likely that its function is confined to the er as any pdi <dig> that would escape the er membrane would be retrieved by the copi retrograde pathway. interestingly, whereas all dicot members of the pdi-b subfamily possessed putative kkxx or xkxx copi-binding signals at their c-termini, all monocot orthologs instead harbored the c-terminal motif xhxx,. this stands in contrast the other subfamily of integral membrane plant pdis, pdi-c, in which both monocot and dicot members possess c-terminal xkxx motifs  <cit> . what effect, if any, the presence of a c-terminal xhxx sequence has on the efficiency of er retention of monocot members of the pdi-b subfamily in comparison to dicot members remains unclear.

protease protection experiments indicate that pdi <dig> is a type i membrane protein with its catalytic a domain oriented into the er lumen . since the members of the pdi-l, pdi-m, and pdi-s subfamilies also localize to the er in arabidopsis  <cit> , what specific role does the membrane-bound pdi <dig> serve in protein folding? there is growing evidence that distinct classes of pdis, while capable of catalyzing similar reactions in vitro, play specialized roles in vivo in oxidative protein folding. for example, although the mammalian classical pdi member, pdia <dig>  can catalyze both disulfide oxidation and disulfide isomerization in peroxiredoxin 4-driven oxidative protein folding, the non-classical pdia <dig>  and txndc <dig>  serve as rapid but promiscuous disulfide oxidases. in contrast, pdia <dig> also functions as an isomerase to correct non-native disulfide bonds  <cit> . this is reminiscent of oxidative protein folding in e. coli, where dsba serves as the principle disulfide oxidase, while dsbc acts as an isomerase  <cit> . here we have shown that the abb’ region of pdi <dig> can functionally complement the e. coli dsba− mutation, indicating that the a domain of pdi <dig> can catalyze the formation  of disulfide bonds when heterologously expressed in the bacterial periplasm.

misfolded proteins can impair cellular processes in a variety of ways, leading to the unfolded protein response  and er stress  <cit> . due to the important role pdis serve in catalyzing protein folding, the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins within the er is accompanied by an increase in pdi expression and activity  <cit> . however, in arabidopsis only a subset of pdi family members are upregulated by chemical inducers of er stress  <cit> . these include half of the pdi-l isoforms , and all isoforms of pdi-m  and pdi-s . the absence of pdi <dig> upregulation in response to er stress, coupled with its atypical er membrane localization, suggests that pdi <dig> functions distinctly from classical pdis. one possibility is that pdi <dig> localizes to the er membrane so that it can rapidly introduce disulfide bonds into newly synthesized secretory proteins as they translocate into the er lumen. alternatively, transmembrane pdi8’s role may be to catalyze disulfide bond formation and isomerization specifically in er transmembrane or membrane-anchored proteins. substrate proteins with relatively few disulfide bonds have a high probability of being in the proper configuration, whereas proteins with multiple disulfide bonds have a higher probability of containing non-native disulfides, which are subsequently isomerized by a different pdi species. since the b’ region serves as the principle binding site for substrates in human pdia <dig>  the unique bb’ sequence of pdi <dig> may allow for the binding of endogenous substrates that are distinct from those of classical eukaryotic pdis.

CONCLUSIONS
pdi <dig> is unique to terrestrial plants, is encoded by a single gene in arabidopsis and is a striking example of a pdi that deviates from the classical a-b-b’-a’ domain arrangement. unlike the majority of the pdi family, pdi <dig> contains a tmd and lacks a second catalytic  domain. we demonstrate that pdi <dig> is a type i endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein and a thiol-disulfide oxidase. this work paves the way for studies that will identify the redox-regulated substrates of pdi <dig> and elucidate its distinct functions in cotyledon guard cells, newly expanding leaves and the vasculature of plants.
