BACKGROUND
aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  <cit>  is a small gram-negative rod implicated in aggressive forms of periodontitis  <cit> . we recently identified and characterized in a. actinomycetemcomitans a 17-kda peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein   <cit> , which is a widely conserved outer membrane lipoprotein  among gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the pals of several pathogens, such as haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli  <cit> , legionella pneumophila, bordetella pertussis, and campylobacter jejuni  <cit>  are proinflammatory and/or strongly immunogenic and can contribute to serum resistance of the bacterium  <cit> . pal may be an important bacterial mediator in sepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  and is crucial for full expression of virulence of haemophilus ducreyi  <cit> .

extracellular release of bacterial virulence factors is a principal mechanism of bacterial pathogenicity  <cit> . different strategies of release include specialized secretory systems  <cit> , outer membrane vesicles  <cit> , and autolysis  <cit> . release of outer membrane vesicles is regarded as the primary mechanism for delivering structural surface components, such as outer membrane proteins  and lipopolysaccharide , into the extracellular milieu. most previous studies on the released bacterial outer membrane components, however, have focused on detecting and isolating them from serum or culture supernatants, or on testing their biological activity  <cit> . less attention has been directed to elucidating whether these components in the test material were derived from lysed cells, outer membrane vesicles, and/or were released from live bacteria in free-soluble form. importantly, the bacterial cell components that are released in free-soluble form may be biologically more active than their membrane-bound counterparts associated with intact bacterial cells or outer membrane vesicles  <cit> .

the present study was designed to investigate the presence and conservation of pal among clinical a. actinomycetemcomitans strains and whether live a. actinomycetemcomitans cells release pal  in free-soluble form. to accomplish these objectives, inserts with  <dig> -μm pore-size filter were used to separate bacterial cells from cell culture wells containing serum or broth. we present compelling evidence for the release of aapal in free-soluble form by demonstrating presence of aapal in the filtrates obtained after incubation, by monitoring bacterial viability in the insert, and by checking for the absence of cell lysis and outer membrane vesicles in the filtrate. proinflammatory effect of aapal was shown in an ex vivo model using human whole blood.

RESULTS
the pal gene was conserved and the protein expressed in clonally diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains
a total of  <dig> a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were analyzed by pcr and immunoblotting. the results from  <dig> strains representing  <dig> serotypes and  <dig> genotypes are shown . the genomic dna and the whole cell protein preparation of these strains each produced the expected 425-bp amplicon in pcr and the 17-kda immunoblot signal with anti-aapal peptide antiserum, respectively.

the rflp analysis with two enzymes, ddei and bspmi, cutting once within the pal sequence  <cit>  showed that the restriction patterns were similar among all test strains . the ddei-digested fragments were  <dig> and  <dig> bp, as predicted, whereas the bspmi-digested fragments were  <dig> and  <dig> bp, which were not the predicted sizes of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the reason seems to be a recognition site for bspmi on the opposite strand approximately  <dig> bp away from the reverse primer binding sequence.

aapal was expressed in various culture conditions
to determine the environmental requirements for aapal expression, we cultured a. actinomycetemcomitans strains in different nutritional and atmospheric conditions. besides conventional cultures, strains were also grown as biofilm  <cit> . the immunoblot analyses of the whole cell protein preparations of strains d7s and d7ss, but not d7ss-p, revealed 17-kda signals, regardless of the culture conditions . furthermore, the 17-kda band appeared stronger when strains d7s and d7ss had been grown in broth incubated in co2-supplemented  air than when grown in other conditions. a particularly strong band was also seen for strain d7s grown as biofilm under anaerobic incubation.

phenotype of the pal-deficient mutants
the strain d7ss-p was constructed to be used as a negative control in the experiments. the strain d7s-p was also constructed to serve as a negative control, but particularly in the experiments aimed to demonstrate with a clinical strain, d7s, that aapal release was not restricted to its spontaneous laboratory variant, d7ss.

comparison between the phenotypes of the mutants and their parents  showed no distinct differences in the colony sizes or densities when standardized numbers of cells  were cultured on plates. the mutants, however, exhibited filamentous cell morphology when observed by wet mounting  and sem. the altered cell morphology was more pronounced when bacteria were cultured in nutritionally poor  rather than in rich  medium . as judged from the sem analysis, there was enhanced vesicle production by the strain d7ss-p relative to d7ss . furthermore, the growth rate of the mutant appeared inferior to the parent . the antibiotic susceptibility comparison between the strains showed that for the mutant, the inhibition zone was larger  for erythromycin but not for cefotaxime or penicillin .

aapal was detected in serum and broth filtrates
to elucidate how aapal could be presented to the host during a. actinomycetemcomitans infection, we studied whether a. actinomycetemcomitans cells released aapal into extracellular space in free-soluble form. for this purpose, we designed an in vitro model, where standardized numbers of bacterial cells were exposed for up to  <dig> h to heat-inactivated fcs . to explore the possibility of aapal release during a. actinomycetemcomitans growth, another similar experiment using d7ss and d7ss-p was performed using culture broth and a longer incubation time  . immunoblot analysis of the filtrates outside the inserts containing strain d7ss or d7s revealed an accumulation of aapal over time . no aapal was detected in the above experiments at any time point in the filtrate when either d7ss-p or d7s-p or no bacteria were incubated in the insert. in all of the above described serum and broth experiments, omp preparations of strains d7ss and d7ss-p were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, in the immunoblot assays .

densitometric quantification indicated that for strain d7ss incubated in serum, aapal concentration after the first  <dig> h was  <dig> ng/ml and at  <dig> h was  <dig> ng/ml . similarly, for strain d7s incubated in serum, aapal concentration after the first  <dig> h was  <dig> ng/ml and at  <dig> h was  <dig> ng/ml . for strain d7ss in broth, aapal concentration at  <dig> h was  <dig> ng/ml .

to ensure the viability of the bacteria during the aapal release experiments described above, we employed bacterial viable counts for samples taken from serum and broth inside the inserts at the same time points as samples that were taken from filtrates for the immunoblot analyses . in serum, the mean cfu  counts of d7ss were  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h and  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h. similarly, the mean cfu counts of d7ss-p were  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h and  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h.

in broth, the mean cfu counts of d7ss were  <dig> -fold higher at 24-h than at  <dig> h. in contrast, the cfu counts of d7ss-p were  <dig> -fold lower at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h .

since the aapal release experiment was performed for strains d7s and d7s-p in serum only, the viable count data are given here: the mean cfu counts of d7s were at  <dig> h  <dig>  ×  <dig>  at  <dig> h  <dig>  ×  <dig> , and at  <dig> h  <dig>  ×  <dig> . the respective mean cfu counts for d7s-p were at  <dig> h  <dig>  ×  <dig>  at  <dig> h  <dig>  ×  <dig> , and at  <dig> h  <dig>  ×  <dig> .

no bacterial growth was found in the samples from the serum or broth filtrates at any time point, ensuring that bacteria growing within the inserts had not passed through the filter and/or that the filtrates had not been contaminated.

for d7ss incubated in serum, although the mean lps concentrations of the filtrates decreased  <dig> -fold from  <dig> h to  <dig> h, there was an increase of  <dig> -fold from  <dig> h to  <dig> h. the mean lps concentrations for strain d7ss-p incubated in serum increased  <dig> -fold from  <dig> h to  <dig> h and  <dig> -fold from  <dig> h to  <dig> h . during broth culture, the mean lps concentrations for d7ss and d7ss-p increased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, from  <dig> h to  <dig> h. however, there were no statistically significant differences in the amounts of lps in the serum or broth filtrates between the two strains at any time point or in regard to the no bacteria control between the different time points. at the  <dig> time point, the lps concentrations of d7ss and d7ss-p in both serum and broth filtrates were almost equal to those of the respective no bacteria control samples .

we also tested for the release of additional a. actinomycetemcomitans components, apart from pal and lps, in the filtrates. immunoblot analysis of the filtrates after an 8-h serum incubation of d7ss, d7ss-p, and no bacteria was carried out by using an antiserum raised against whole cell antigen of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a . several immunoreactive bands of unknown identity but representing apparent molecular weights ≈ 10– <dig> kda were detected in the filtrates from both d7ss and d7ss-p, but not in the no bacteria controls .

extracellular release of aapal was independent of cell lysis
to exclude the possibility that the a. actinomycetemcomitans cells had lysed in the inserts, the filtrates in which aapal was detected were also tested by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against a cytoplasmic marker, camp receptor protein. anti-vibrio cholerae camp receptor protein antibodies were chosen since the protein is 79% identical and 94% similar to a. actinomycetemcomitans camp receptor protein. whole cell protein preparation of v. cholerae  reacted at an expected  <dig> kda size, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans whole cell protein preparation showed an immunoreactive band at ≈  <dig> kda . this molecular weight was higher than the weight deduced from its amino acid sequence,  <dig>  kda .

our findings demonstrate that camp receptor protein could not be detected in any of the filtrate samples obtained from the cell-culture insert model , not even when the filtrates were concentrated with trichloroacetic acid precipitation .

to show that soluble camp receptor protein could be detected in filtrates from lysed bacteria, deliberately broken  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells were incubated in cell culture inserts containing broth for  <dig> h as described above. as shown in fig.  <dig>  filtrates from lysed but not from unlysed d7ss cells contained detectable amounts of camp receptor protein.

aapal was associated with a. actinomycetemcomitans outer membrane vesicles
to investigate whether aapal could be detected in association with the vesicles, the vesicle preparations were analyzed using immunoblotting. a weak 17-kda signal was detected in d7ss but not d7ss-p vesicles , whereas the vesicle preparation supernatants obtained after ultracentrifugation , showed a strong aapal signal for strain d7ss  .

extracellular release of aapal was independent of outer membrane vesicles
since aapal was detected in vesicle preparations from a. actinomycetemcomitans cultures , we wanted to exclude the possibility that vesicles were the source of aapal in the filtrates. electron microscopic examination of the vesicle preparations of the filtrates demonstrated large amounts of serum protein aggregates in all filtrates . however, no vesicles were found in any of the filtrates at any time point. data from time point  <dig> h are shown in fig.  <dig>  vesicle preparations from d7ss whole cell suspension, used as a positive control, revealed vesicles of an average diameter  <dig> – <dig>  μm .

aapal induced cytokines in an ex vivo model
the effect of aapal on the cytokine milieu in human whole blood was profiled by using a cytokine antibody array and a preparation of affinity purified aapal, containing less than  <dig> pg lps per μg of aapal  <cit> . production of interleukins il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and a macrophage inflammatory protein, mip-1β, was demonstrated by enhanced signals . based on visual analysis the effects appeared to be concentration-dependent.

discussion
the present study demonstrates that a. actinomycetemcomitans releases aapal, a structural omlp, in free-soluble form. the primary route for outer membrane components of bacteria, such as lps and various proteins including porins  <cit>  to the extracellular space is through the release of outer membrane vesicles. although not widely studied, there are a few reports on the release of omps, such as ompa, pal, and major lipoprotein , either in soluble form  <cit>  or in the form of complexes  <cit> . in those studies, however, the methods were not designed to exclude the presence of vesicles in the samples  <cit>  or bacterial death or lysis  <cit> . our study made an attempt to control those factors and showed that aapal is released independent of vesicles. release of free-soluble bacterial components, such as shown here for a lipoprotein, would be of biological significance, since these components can cross anatomical barriers impermeable to whole bacteria or even vesicles  <cit> . in addition, there is evidence to suggest that in free form bacterial components convey higher biological activity than when they are membrane-bound in intact bacteria or in vesicles  <cit> . regardless, the results of the present study accentuate a less studied strategy by which oral bacteria, like bacteria in other localized infections, may express extended pathogenicity.

our experimental model comprised a cell culture insert. based on the previous literature on a. actinomycetemcomitans outer membrane vesicles  <cit> , we chose a membrane filter with a pore size  that would not allow cells or vesicles to pass through. an electron microscopic examination verified that the vesicle size for the present a. actinomycetemcomitans strains indeed was larger than the pores in the chosen filter. this renders unlikely the possibility that vesicles would have passed through the filter, which was further confirmed by the absence of vesicles in the filtrates. no literature was found about release of material from intact vesicles. instead, vesicles are known to be considerably stable structures  <cit>  and therefore, the possibility that lysed vesicles would have been the source of free-soluble aapal may be low.

yet another possibility was that a. actinomycetemcomitans cells had died and lysed in the inserts, so we continuously monitored the viability of the bacteria grown in the inserts. the fact the total bacterial numbers increased over time shows that viability was maintained in the experiments. however, despite the increased total numbers, lysis of dying bacteria in the growing a. actinomycetemcomitans population may have presented a source of aapal in the filtrate. therefore, we, like others  <cit> , excluded the possibility of bacterial lysis by confirming the absence of a cytoplasmic marker in the same filtrate samples from which aapal was found.

thus, neither vesicles passing through the filters nor cell death/lysis seemed to be the source of aapal in the filtrate samples. further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism by which free-soluble aapal is released into extracellular space and how the release is regulated. currently, it would be tempting to speculate that the mechanism involves activation of outer membrane phospholipase a  <cit> . by degrading phospholipids of the outer membrane, phospholipase a could liberate aapal along with other components of the outer membrane into the extracellular milieu. for other species, release of cell components, such as proteins, lps and phospholipids has been reported following activation of phospholipase a, without an effect on growth or cell morphology  <cit> . due to its strict regulation, phospholipase a activity does not lead to bacterial cell lysis  <cit> .

for the biological activity of the released free-soluble aapal it is crucial that it retains the lipid domain, because lipoprotein-mediated cytokine induction is solely attributed to the lipid domain  <cit> . our results support the retention of the lipid part of aapal, since the immunoblot detection from the filtrate demonstrated a band of the same mw  as that of purified aapal . therefore, the extracellularly released aapal seems to be neither proteolytically cleaved nor missing its lipid domain. the activity of free-soluble aapal may also be related to its association with other bacterial components. our present study did not provide data to suggest an association but demonstrated co-release of aapal with lps and other unidentified a. actinomycetemcomitans components. however, an association is possible, since previous studies have shown tight association between lps and released e. coli pal  <cit> , as well as between extracellularly released ompa, major lipoprotein, pal and lps  <cit> .

since in this study we were unable to obtain the extracellularly released aapal in pure form and therefore did not know whether or not it was complexed with other bacterial components, we chose to study the immunostimulatory effect of purified aapal in an ex vivo model. our results showed a dose-dependent enhancement in the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and mip-1β after an 8-h stimulation, using purified aapal. a search of the literature revealed no previous studies of cytokine production from whole blood by using aapal, or other lipoproteins or omps of this species. the only study on other species also reported an increased il- <dig> production from blood after incubation with e. coli pal  <cit> . in general, il- <dig> and il- <dig> are among the major cytokines produced by whole blood after stimulation with bacterial components  <cit> . il- <dig> has a wide range of biological activities, among them proinflammatory properties and a role as the main stimulus for acute phase protein synthesis and release from liver in infection  <cit> . one of the two chemokines induced by aapal in our study, il- <dig>  a prototypic cxc-chemokine and classically known as a neutrophil chemoattractant, mediates monocyte trafficking and functions as a macrophage stimulator  <cit> . the other chemokine, mip-1β, a cc-subfamily chemokine, is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and t cells  <cit> . thus, even though we currently do not know the bioactivity of released free-soluble aapal, in purified form aapal has proinflammatory and prochemotactic properties that can lead to stimulation and differentiation of various cell types and further production of cytokines.

our consistent results from rflp of the a. actinomycetemcomitans pal gene and the immunoblot detection of the gene product indicate that the gene is conserved and the protein ubiquitously expressed in clonally diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. this is in agreement with the intraspecies conservation of pal in other pasteurellaceae members, such as haemophilus influenzae  <cit> . the intraspecies conservation of aapal suggests that its bioactivity is comparable among different a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. the fact that aapal was expressed in a variety of different nutritional and atmospheric conditions may underscore its importance for the normal function of the bacterium. in addition, aapal was expressed during the exposure to serum and culture in anaerobic atmosphere. since these conditions bear resemblance to those in pathologically deepened periodontal pockets, the results suggest that aapal is also expressed in vivo.

we included the pal-deficient mutant strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans primarily to corroborate our results from the immunoblot and other experiments. comparisons of the phenotypic characteristics of the mutant and parent may, however, provide preliminary information about the role and function of aapal in a. actinomycetemcomitans cell physiology. we found that the mutants had decreased growth rate and filamentous cell morphology, differing partly from the pal-deficient mutant of h. ducreyi, which showed unchanged growth rate  <cit> . although there were limitations in the present methods for estimating bacterial numbers, our results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating reduced growth rate of bacteria with mutations in tol-pal genes  <cit> . moreover, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pal-deficient a. actinomycetemcomitans mutant, d7ss-p, selectively changed. the susceptibility to erythromycin, but not to the β-lactams, increased. previous studies have shown increased antibiotic susceptibility of strains with tol-pal gene mutations  <cit> . additionally, mutations in genes encoding certain omps, such as ssc and enva of e. coli , have resulted in hypersusceptibility to hydrophobic antibiotics, including erythromycin  <cit> . our finding that the susceptibility of the pal-deficient a. actinomycetemcomitans mutant to the tested β-lactams did not increase may result from the inefficiency of the β-lactam antibiotics to kill slowly multiplying bacteria  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that live a. actinomycetemcomitans cells release aapal in free-soluble form independent of vesicles. the proinflammatory and prochemotactic properties of aapal may contribute to producing a long-term immune challenge in persistent a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated infections. the extracellular release of pal is also of more general interest because bacterial lipoproteins are increasingly being recognized as playing an important role in bacterial pathogenicity  <cit> .
