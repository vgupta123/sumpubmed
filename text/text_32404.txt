BACKGROUND
atp-sensitive k+  channels are important regulators of cell function, coupling energy metabolism with electrical activity. katp channels are comprised of two proteins, derived from the sulphonylurea receptor  family and an inwardly rectifying k+ channel , the exact composition of these being dependent upon tissue  <cit> . for example, pancreatic β-cells and insulin-secreting clonal cell lines express katp channels consisting of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits  <cit> . katp channels are present in numerous tissues and are the target for drugs that inhibit or increase channel activity  <cit> . the archetypal inhibitors of these channels are the sulphonylurea class of drugs, which bind to the sur subunit of the channel. modulation of katp channel activity in pancreatic β-cells has profound effects on insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis  <cit> . sulphonylureas such as tolbutamide and glibenclamide inhibit channel activity, resulting in β-cell depolarization, increased electrical activity, enhanced calcium entry and consequently increased insulin secretion  <cit> . in contrast, pancreatic β-cell katp channel activation induces hyperglycaemia in animals and man  <cit> . this latter action is caused by membrane hyperpolarization, reduction in cell excitability and decreased intracellular calcium resulting in reduced secretion of insulin. such effects have been reported following application of the benzothiadiazine, diazoxide, which has been used on occasion to treat persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia of infancy  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that diazoxide interacts with the sulphonylurea receptor subunit, sur <dig>  encompassing transmembrane domains 6– <dig> and the first nucleotide binding fold  <cit> . a similar conclusion has also been reached using a novel diazoxide analogue  <cit> . the presence of katp channels in many other tissues, notably muscle and central neurons, has stimulated interest in the development of novel, selective katp channel openers for the treatment of various diseases  <cit> .

the ob gene product leptin has been demonstrated to activate katp channels in pancreatic β-cells  <cit>  and insulin-secreting cell lines  <cit> , consistent with a potential role in modifying insulin secretion  <cit> . one of the primary functions for this hormone is its role in the regulation of food intake and body weight  <cit> . interestingly, leptin also activates katp channels of hypothalamic glucose-responsive neurones  <cit>  indicating a possible role for this channel in the control of energy homeostasis and body weight. in addition, kir <dig>  knock-out mice have deficits in central glucose sensing leading to loss of glucose mediated feeding response and a defective hypoglycaemic compensatory response  <cit> . these latter findings suggest that hypothalamic katp channels may also be an important target for drug manipulation with respect to centrally driven control of glucose and energy homeostasis. the aminoguanidine carboxylate, bvt. <dig> , is one of a series of structurally related molecules based on the anti-diabetic/anti-obesity agent 3-guanidinopropionic acid  <cit> , which, like leptin, have been demonstrated to reduce body weight in obese diabetic  mice  <cit> . here we demonstrate that bvt. <dig> opens katp channels in the cri-g <dig> insulin secreting cell line, a useful model for pancreatic β-cells  <cit> , and for analysing the mechanism by which leptin opens katp channels  <cit> .

RESULTS
bvt. <dig> activates katp channels
under current clamp conditions with  <dig> mm atp in the pipette solution to maintain katp channels in the closed state, the mean resting potential was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , similar to values reported in previous studies  <cit>  under these recording conditions. application of bvt. <dig>  hyperpolarized cri-g <dig> cells  to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . examination of the voltage-clamped macroscopic currents indicates that prior to the addition of bvt. <dig> the slope conductance of the cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns , and following exposure to bvt. <dig> , this increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns . the reversal potential  associated with the bvt.12777-induced conductance increase  was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , close to the calculated value for ek of - <dig> mv in this system, indicating increased k+ conductance. cri-g <dig> cells responded to bvt. <dig> in an all or none manner, with cells undergoing full hyperpolarization and increase in conductance, at all concentrations  examined. such an effect has also been reported for leptin on cri-g <dig> cells  <cit> . removal of bvt. <dig> from the bath solution did not fully recover the membrane potential and conductance to control values over the next 15– <dig> minutes . application of the katp channel inhibitor, tolbutamide  during bvt. <dig> exposure  completely reversed the bvt.12777-induced hyperpolarization and decreased conductance, to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns  respectively, values indistinguishable from control . these data indicate that bvt. <dig> increases katp current in this cell line. this is demonstrated more clearly in cell-attached recordings from cri-g <dig> cells, where bath application of bvt. <dig>  resulted in activation of single katp channel currents . the increase in channel activity was evident within  <dig> minutes of drug application, was sustained over the time course of exposure  and was not immediately reversed following removal of the drug. figure 2c shows mean channel activity , normalised to the control for each recording, plotted against time of exposure to bvt. <dig>  bvt. <dig> activation of katp channels was demonstrated to be reversibly inhibited by  <dig> μm tolbutamide . identical control experiments, in the absence of bvt. <dig>  resulted in no significant effect on katp channel activity, over a 30-minute test period .

the effect of bvt. <dig> on katp channel activity in excised membrane patches was also examined. recordings were made from inside-out patches in symmetrical  k+ at a membrane potential of - <dig> mv. katp channels were identified by inhibition of channel activity following application of  <dig> μm mgatp to the inner membrane aspect of the patch, which reduced normalised nfpo from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . subsequent application of  <dig> μm bvt. <dig>  in the continued presence of mgatp, induced a gradual increase in katp channel activity , to levels similar to that of control . for example  <dig> minutes after  <dig> μm bvt. <dig> application normalised mean channel activity had recovered to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in experiments where no drug was added, katp channel currents, in the presence of  <dig> μm mgatp, did not activate spontaneously .

bvt. <dig> activates katp channels independently of pi 3-kinase activity
leptin and diazoxide hyperpolarized cri-g <dig> cells, in a manner similar to that of bvt. <dig> . leptin  induced a hyperpolarization from a mean membrane potential of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and application of tolbutamide  reversed this action, returning the membrane potential to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . diazoxide  rapidly hyperpolarized cri-g <dig> cells from a mean membrane potential of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , with tolbutamide  also reversing this action, returning membrane potential to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . leptin, but not diazoxide activation of cri-g <dig> katp channels is pi3k dependent  <cit> . thus, we investigated whether bvt. <dig> activates katp channels in cri-g <dig> cells by direct  or indirect  mechanisms.

pre-incubation of cri-g <dig> cells  with inhibitors of pi 3-kinase, wortmannin  or ly <dig>  had no significant effect on the mean resting membrane potential or slope conductance of cri-g <dig> cells and did not prevent bvt. <dig> from causing hyperpolarization and increased cell conductance . in the presence of  <dig> nm wortmannin, values for mean membrane potential and slope conductance were - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns , and addition of  <dig> μm bvt. <dig> hyperpolarized cells to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  with an increase in slope conductance to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns . identical results were obtained in the presence of  <dig> μm ly <dig> , with corresponding control values of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns , and in the presence of  <dig> μm bvt. <dig>  - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns  for membrane potential and slope conductance respectively. in all experiments  addition of tolbutamide  recovered the membrane potential  and slope conductance  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   ns) for wortmannin and ly <dig> respectively, to values indistinguishable from controls . cell-attached recordings from cri-g <dig> cells also show that wortmannin  did not occlude bvt. <dig> activation of katp channels . mean channel activity in the presence of wortmannin  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  which increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig> minutes after exposure to  <dig> μm bvt. <dig> . control experiments where no bvt. <dig> was added show no change in channel activity over a 30-minute period .

heterologously expressed katp currents are not activated by bvt.12777
oocytes injected with kir <dig>  and sur <dig> crnas were challenged with sodium azide  to elicit a reversible increase in current, which was completely blocked by  <dig> μm glibenclamide or  <dig>  mm tolbutamide, indicating that the current was due to katp activation, as described previously  <cit> . in oocytes, previously exposed to sodium azide in order to verify kir <dig> -sur <dig> expression, application of bvt. <dig>  did not produce any consistent increase in katp current . consequently, we utilized an alternative expression system, the hek  <dig> cell line  <cit> . application of bvt. <dig>  to the bathing solution using the cell-attached recording configuration resulted in no significant increase in mean channel activity above control levels over a 30-minute period, although subsequent addition of sodium azide  did cause a rapid increase in channel activity, which was reversed by the addition of  <dig> μm tolbutamide . similarly, application of bvt. <dig> in the presence of  <dig>  mm mgatp to inside-out patches from hek  <dig> cells transiently expressing kir <dig> -sur <dig>  did not cause activation of channel activity following  <dig> minutes exposure . thus bvt. <dig> does not appear to be capable of activating heterologously expressed kir <dig> -sur <dig> currents.

mapk does not mediate bvt.12777-activation of katp
exposure of cri-g <dig> cells to bvt. <dig>  for up to  <dig> minutes had no consistent effect on the phosphorylation of enzymes downstream of pi3k , but did increase the phosphorylation of stat <dig>  and mapk . these data are in agreement with the lack of bvt. <dig> sensitivity to pi3k inhibitors on activation of katp channels. however, activation of mapk has been implicated as a significant intermediate for both insulin and leptin signalling pathways in various cell types  <cit> . thus, we examined the effect of uo <dig>  a potent and specific inhibitor of the activation of the classical mapk cascade  <cit> , on bvt. <dig> opening of katp channels. application of uo <dig>  inhibited approximately  <dig> % of katp channel activity in cell-attached or inside-out recordings, whereas 1– <dig> μm uo <dig>  concentrations that suppresses activation of mapkk  <cit> , had no significant effect on channel activity . control cell attached recordings had a mean channel activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in the presence of bvt. <dig> . subsequent application of uo <dig>  in the continued presence of bvt. <dig> did not alter channel activity , over a 15-minute period  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes respectively; p <  <dig> ). in addition, increasing uo <dig> to  <dig> μm had no effect on bvt. <dig> induced katp channel activation.

bvt. <dig> activation of katp channels is dependent on actin cytoskeleton dynamics
leptin activation of katp channels in the cri-g <dig> cell line is dependent upon reorganisation of the cytoskeleton, a process downstream from pi3k activation  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether bvt. <dig> opening of cri-g <dig> katp channels occurs through alteration of actin filament dynamics. for this series of experiments the heptapeptide mushroom toxin phalloidin  <cit>  was used to stabilise the polymerised form of actin . as phalloidin is membrane-impermeant, it was directly applied to the internal aspect of the cell membrane. in whole-cell experiments,  <dig> μm phalloidin was added to the electrode solution and allowed to dialyse into the cell. the mean resting potential and slope conductance were - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns  respectively, and following addition of  <dig> μm bvt. <dig> no significant change in these parameters was observed , with a mean membrane potential of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv and slope conductance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns . the presence of phalloidin  in the bath solution also prevented katp channel activation by bvt. <dig> in the inside-out isolated patch configuration . application of  <dig>  mm mgatp to the cytoplasmic aspect of inside-out patches caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % inhibition of katp channel activity  and subsequent addition of  <dig> μm phalloidin had no further effect, as reported previously  <cit> . subsequent addition of bvt. <dig>  failed to increase katp channel activity, with mean nf.po values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the absence and presence of bvt. <dig> respectively . in contrast, the direct katp channel opener, diazoxide activates katp channels in the presence of phalloidin. in whole-cell experiments , diazoxide  hyperpolarized cri-g <dig> cells from a mean membrane potential of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and increased slope conductance from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> , actions reversed by tolbutamide .

f-actin is disrupted by bvt.12777
the prevention of bvt.12777-induced katp activation by phalloidin mirrors the effect of this toxin on leptin activation of katp  <cit> . thus, we visualised f-actin by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. in untreated cri-g <dig> cells there was pronounced phalloidin-positive labelling of the cell membrane, with more diffuse, granular staining within the cytoplasm . in contrast, cells treated with bvt. <dig>  or leptin  for  <dig> min showed a marked reduction in phalloidin fluorescence intensity, with disjointed labelling at the cell membrane . the actin filament disrupter cytochalasin b  <cit>  also reduced the intensity of phalloidin labelling but in a more punctate manner on visualisation of treated cells compared with controls . analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity at the cell membrane following the actions of bvt. <dig> and leptin demonstrated that both treatments caused a significant reduction of the intensity of rhodamine-phalloidin labelling, by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , respectively, compared to untreated cells . however, the directly acting katp channel opener, diazoxide did not cause disruption of the actin cytoskeleton , with a relative intensity of rhodamine-phalloidin staining of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

discussion
bvt. <dig> induced hyperpolarization of cri-g <dig> cells, with an associated increase in k+ conductance, an action likely caused by the activation of katp channels, as the sulphonylurea tolbutamide completely reversed its effects. cell-attached and inside-out single channel current recordings demonstrate directly that bvt. <dig> activates katp channels. the increased katp current generated in isolated membrane patches resembles the effects of katp activators such as diazoxide  <cit>  and sodium azide  <cit> , which have also been shown to activate insulinoma or pancreatic β-cell katp channels in isolated patches in the presence of mg-atp. thus, although not tested here, bvt. <dig> as an activator of katp would be expected, as observed for diazoxide, to inhibit insulin release from cri-g <dig> cells stimulated by metabolizable substrates or tolbutamide  <cit> , although this would clearly be dependent on its action on other β-cell conductances, notably calcium channels. bvt. <dig> activation of katp channels was only slowly reversed on withdrawal of the drug, unlike the actions of diazoxide or sodium azide, which are rapidly reversed on washout  <cit> . indeed, following removal of bvt. <dig> in the absence or presence of tolbutamide, enhanced katp channel activity was apparent for a considerable time. the slow reversibility on washout of bvt. <dig> resembles the effects of the hormone leptin on cri-g <dig> cell membrane potential and katp channel activation  <cit> .

leptin, via activation of the main signalling form of the leptin receptor , has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of stat <dig>  mapk and to stimulate pi3k pathways in various peripheral tissues, cell lines  <cit> , and in hypothalamic neurones  <cit> . bvt. <dig> although stimulating phosphorylation of stat <dig> and mapk did not stimulate pi3k dependent pathways as demonstrated by the lack of effect on the phosphorylation status of the pi3k output indicators, pkb and gsk <dig>  it is unclear at present how this molecule induces stat <dig> and mapk phosphorylation. as katp activation by bvt. <dig> is rapid and occurs in isolated membrane patches it is unlikely that any jak-stat pathway  contributes to this action. leptin activation of katp channel currents in cri-g <dig> cells has previously been shown to be independent of mapk, but prevented by the inhibitors of pi3k  <cit> . however, bvt. <dig> activation was not only insensitive to inhibition by the mapkk inhibitor, uo <dig>  it was also insensitive to the presence of the pi3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and ly <dig>  at concentrations sufficient to prevent leptin activation of katp in this cell line. these data led us to suspect that bvt. <dig>  irrespective of its ability to initiate various signalling cascades in this cell line, increased katp channel activity by a more direct effect on the channel subunits in a manner analogous to diazoxide, which is purported to interact directly with the sur <dig> subunit  <cit> . this possibility was tested by heterologous expression of the β-cell subunits of katp channels, kir <dig>  and sur <dig>  in xenopus oocytes, a commonly utilised expression system for electrophysiological studies of these recombinant channels  <cit> . however, bvt. <dig> did not activate kir <dig> -sur <dig> currents in oocytes, demonstrated to express functional katp channel currents. thus we explored this question further by utilising a second heterologous expression system for kir <dig> -sur <dig>  hek <dig> cells. recordings from inside-out patches demonstrated that bvt. <dig> did not activate kir <dig> -sur <dig> currents in the presence of mg-atp, in contrast to diazoxide  <cit>  or sodium azide  <cit> . overall these data strongly suggest that expression of the katp channel subunits, kir <dig>  and sur <dig> are insufficient per se to bring about sensitivity to bvt. <dig>  and indicate that this opener may activate this channel type by an indirect mechanism .

although the activation of katp channels by leptin in cri-g <dig> cells is pi3-kinase dependent the lipid products of this enzyme system, such as ptdinsp <dig> also do not interact directly with katp channels  <cit> . recent studies demonstrate that both leptin and ptdinsp <dig> increase katp channel activity indirectly, through changes in cytoskeletal dynamics  <cit> . it is well established that many ion channels and transporters are anchored in the membrane by either direct or indirect association with the cytoskeleton. in addition, there is growing evidence that altering the integrity of cytoskeletal elements, in particular actin filaments, can modulate the activity of a variety of ion channels  <cit>  and receptors  <cit> . for example, disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin is shown to increase katp channel activity in cardiac myocytes  <cit>  and cri-g <dig> cells  <cit> . indeed, a number of lipid kinases, including pi 3-kinase, are also localised to the cytoskeleton and their activities are modulated by a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, especially those associated with actin  <cit> . actin filament structure is controlled by reversible polymerisation of g-actin, which forms f-actin, and this process is under the dynamic control of various actin-binding proteins  <cit> . the heptapeptide mushroom toxin phalloidin  <cit>  binds to filamentous f-actin with high affinity and stabilises the actin in this form. the addition of phalloidin to the intracellular aspect of cri-g <dig> cells prevented bvt. <dig>  but not diazoxide, from activation of katp channel currents in whole cell and inside out recording configurations indicating that this molecule likely causes the opening of katp channels by a membrane delimited alteration of cytoskeletal dynamics. this mechanism of action is identical to that proposed for leptin and ptdinsp <dig> activation of katp in this cell line  <cit> . fluorescence staining of cri-g <dig> cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin revealed disassembly of actin filaments by both bvt. <dig> and leptin, but not diazoxide. these data provide direct support for an important role for cytoskeletal dynamics in the control of katp channel activity by both leptin and bvt. <dig>  the lack of effect of diazoxide on the actin filament structure is also supportive of this opener acting directly on the katp channel subunits.

CONCLUSIONS
bvt. <dig> activation of katp channels in cri-g <dig> cells was evident regardless of whether it was applied to the external or internal surface of the cell. bvt. <dig> signalling to katp channels is not mediated by pi 3-kinase or mapk, but does appear to depend on actin filament re-modelling. as leptin hyperpolarizes a sub-population of hypothalamic neurones by opening katp channels  <cit> , it is feasible that at least part of the anti-obesity action of bvt. <dig> may be through the activation of this potassium channel. furthermore, as bvt. <dig> acts downstream of pi3k, such an agent may act to overcome the putative central leptin resistance associated with the obese state  <cit> . thus, although bvt. <dig> and its close structural analogues are unlikely per se to be useful anti-obesity agents as they display hepatotoxicity  <cit> , understanding the general principles underlying their mechanism of action may reveal clues for future anti-obesity drug development.
