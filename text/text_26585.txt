BACKGROUND
the two most basic properties of stem cells are their capacity for indefinite self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell or tissue types  <cit> . embryonic stem cells are totipotent and can be maintained in culture in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor   <cit> . withdrawal of lif induces the formation of cellular aggregates called embryonic bodies. a wide variety of cell types migrate away from embryonic bodies, including some with neuron-like morphology  <cit> . in addition, embryonic stem cells may be differentiated into neurons and glial cells with retinoic acid or basic fibroblast growth factor   <cit> .

neurons derived from embryonic stem cells express neurofilaments, neuron-specific class iii β-tubulin  and a number of neuron-specific microtubule-associated proteins  <cit> . neural stem cells  are immature, uncommitted cells that exist in both the developing brain and the adult nervous system  <cit> . these cells can undergo expansion and differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes  <cit> . stem cells differentiated into neurons from both these sources display a limited proliferation potential. obtaining them requires invasive procedures and results in ethical limitations in their use  <cit> . because neuroblastoma cells can mimic the morphological and biochemical characteristics of primary neurons, they have proved to be highly valuable models in analyzing the neuropathogenesis and neurotropism of a range of viruses  <cit> . to overcome ethical issues regarding the use of fetal and adult brain samples, mesenchymal cells  isolated from the wharton’s jelly  of human and animal umbilical cords  represent an attractive alternative. these cells are easily obtained, proliferate rapidly in culture, are immunologically compatible, and represent fetal adnexa that is usually discarded  <cit> . mscs have been previously isolated from dogs, sheep, horses  <cit> , and recently bovine wj-uc  <cit> . the wj-uc cell structure is embryonic in origin and encloses the yolk sac, which is the source of the primordial germ cells and the first hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> .

the neurotropic rna and dna viruses that produce central nervous system  diseases employ a range of pathologic mechanisms in a variety of hosts. the useful biological models applied to isolate, propagate, and study biological properties of these viruses include mice, rabbits, monkeys and hamsters. the α-herpesviruses, including human herpes simplex types  <dig> and  <dig> , varicella-zoster virus , animal pathogens such as pseudorabies virus , bovine herpesvirus types  <dig> and  <dig> , and marek’s disease virus are neurotropic viruses capable of invading the peripheral and central nervous systems to cause neurological disease  <cit> . bohv- <dig> belongs to the family herpesviridae, subfamily α-herpesvirinae, and genus varicellovirus. bohv- <dig> is genetically and antigenically closely related to bohv- <dig>  a highly prevalent virus responsible for respiratory and genital disease in cattle around the world  <cit> .

bohv- <dig>  associated with respiratory and genital disease, and bohv- <dig>  associated with neurological disease, cause significant agricultural loss.  <cit> . experimentally infected cattle and/or rabbits have been used to better understand the neural invasion and spread of bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig>  <cit> . indeed, rabbits have been used as an animal model to study selected aspects of acute and latent infections caused by bohv- <dig>  <cit> . unlike bohv- <dig>  bohv- <dig> can be difficult to isolate from cell culture and animals presenting neurological symptoms after experimental inoculation  <cit> . these difficulties in viral isolation might be related to low virus titres present in tissue sections  <cit> .

in contrast with in vivo studies, in vitro studies with madin-darby bovine kidney  cells and primary cell cultures of bovine origin represent adequate substrates for viral in vitro studies  <cit> . in cell culture, bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig> share similar phenotypes and produce similar cytopathic effects . cpe are characterized by a round cell shape and presence of multinucleated and syncytial cells  <cit> . in a previous report, the cpe observed in bovine lung cells infected with bohv- <dig> were elongated and spindle-shape cells; in contrast, bohv- <dig> infected cells showed syncytial-like cpe  <cit> . in spite of many reports describing the difficulty of re-isolating the virus from field samples and experimentally infected rabbits, the mdbk cell line has been used as a standard substrate for bohv- <dig> isolation and propagation in vitro <cit> . to date, no effort has been made to develop a better in vitro culture system for virus isolation/propagation. optimizing viral culture would reduce the need for the use of animal models. in this context, the aim of the present study was to generate a novel in vitro biological model/substrate that would differentiate bovine wj-msc cells into neuron-like cells susceptible to neurotropic bohv- <dig> replication. in addition, such a model would provide a means for rapidly examining key aspects of the interactions between bohv- <dig> and bovine neuron-like cells. in particular, this model system may overcome many of the limitations of live animals, primary neuronal culture, or neural mesenchymal cells from fetuses with less costly experimentation and ethical constraints.

RESULTS
differentiation of stem cells into neuron-like cells
the main objective of the present study was to assess the full neural potential of bwj-mscs after culture in a retinoic acid-deprived reprogramming medium. continuous culture for  <dig> days resulted in cells exhibiting varied morphologies, including cells with multiple long thin-axon-like processes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days . furthermore, we observed the presence of neurons and oligodendrocytes based on morphology of spindle-like cells with multiple, network forming , long-branch projections . in addition, neural-like cells displayed distinct neuronal morphology, ranging from simple bipolar to large, extensively branched, multipolar cells . thus, after  <dig> days of neuron induction, bwj-uc cells were capable of generating both neuron and glial-like cells.


characterization of differentiated neuron-like cells
the distribution of neural/glial cell markers in differentiated cells is shown in table  <dig>  immunostaining for neuro-differentiation markers displayed 75-100% expression of n <dig>  map <dig>  nt <dig>  tau, and gfap. approximately 50-75% of differentiated cells were positive for nestin, cxcr <dig>  and tuji. the ubiquitin marker was less frequently detected among differentiated cells . consistent with these observations, rt-pcr confirmed presence of nestin, n <dig>  β-tubulin iii , gfap and nt <dig> mrna . flow cytometric analysis was used to determine the phenotype of the neuron-like cells. cell-surface markers that characterize neuro-differentiation at  <dig> days of culture were analyzed. the results showed that cells expressed at least 70% of putative neuronal markers such as nt <dig>  gfap, map <dig>  tau and n <dig> . nestin, β-tubulin iii, ubiquitin, and cxcr <dig> were also expressed, but at lower rates . our experiments confirmed previous studies demonstrating the ability of human mscs derived from wharton’s jelly layer to generate neuron-like cells. our results also demonstrated cross-reactivity among human and bovine monoclonal antibodies against these markers.


avalues were determined by visually counting positive cells .

susceptibility of neuron-like cells to bohv- <dig> infection
the susceptibility of neuron-like cells to bohv- <dig> infection was investigated by assessing the viral growth curve, cell viability, and cytopathology. the one-step kinetic growth curve profile for infected neuron-like cells was established. cpe are an important parameter in the in vitro characterization of viral lytic potential. to study the cpe, an indirect measure of viral cell-to-cell spread – morphology, viral antigens, and dna were monitored. following infection, cpe was characterized by an enlargement of the neuronal branches  and by appearance of small and large vesicles . bohv- <dig> antigens were detected by immunofluorescence at  <dig> h p.i.  and active bohv- <dig> replication was detected by ish . the viral dna label was observed almost exclusively in the perinuclear region of infected neurons and ranged from sporadic to dense grain accumulations along neuron branches . almost 60% of neurons demonstrated active viral dna replication by 72– <dig> h p.i.  . in the replication curve, maximum viral titre was observed at  <dig> h p.i.  and loss of cell viability occurred only after  <dig> h p.i. . altogether, these results demonstrate that differentiated bwj-mcs cells support productive bohv- <dig> replication.


discussion
several studies have described the ability of wharton’s jelly cells from a variety of animal species to differentiate into neurons and/or glial cells in vitro <cit> . the most commonly applied protocol to induce undifferentiated msc cells to differentiate into neuron-like cells is based on treatment with bfgf , dimethylsulfoxide  and butylatedhydroxyanisole   <cit> . some differences have also been described in the use of retinoic acid  and/or insulin associated with hydrocortisone  <cit> . retinoic acid is an oxidized derivative of retinol and is the active form of vitamin a. ra functions as a specific ligand for the retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway, which is required in embryonic development, bone formation, and in the maintenance of normal epithelial structures. the addition of ra to induction medium has been shown to influence neuronal differentiation and to improve cell survival  <cit> .

the precise composition of the culture medium is critical to avoid inconsistent results, especially when the reagents are obtained from different sources. with regard to ra, most of the neural induction methods in rodent or human mscs employ a combination of ra with other chemical agents, cytokines, and growth factors  <cit> . in the present study, a commercially defined medium with no supplement was used to facilitate the reproducibility of the culture system. another advantage of the culture system developed herein is the natural adherence of neuron-like cells to the plastic flasks. this phenotype is different from neuron-like cells derived from fetal brain tissue which require a specific substrate to initiate differentiation  <cit> . collectively, the results presented here indicate that it is possible to derive neuron-like cells from bwj-mscs. these differentiated cells maintain identical morphology and cell viability after  <dig> days of in vitro culture with a commercial medium. moreover, there are no ethical issues in using cells in vitro from umbilical cords versus fetal brains. following neuronal differentiation, the neuron-like cells clearly exhibited their neurogenic potential by expressing classic neuronal markers such n <dig>  map <dig>  nt <dig>  tau and gfap. nestin, cxcr <dig>  and tuji were also detected, but at lower intensities. importantly, none of these neuronal markers were detectable inundifferentiated cells, suggesting the lack of spontaneous neuronal potential. however, a previous study using porcine `wj-mscs described similar expression levels of neuron-specific enolase  in differentiated and undifferentiated cells  <cit> . this finding has also been reported for bone marrow stromal cells isolated from rats, pigs, and humans  <cit> . neurofilaments and gfap, both considered important neuronal/glial proteins, were also found to be expressed in undifferentiated and differentiated mscs using ra as a neuronal inducer for human bone marrow stromal cells  <cit> . furthermore, flow cytometric analysis found that differentiated bwj-mscs expressed nt <dig>  gfap, map <dig>  tau, and n <dig>  this indicates the presence of neural precursors, mature neurons, and glial cells in the same culture. similar results have been reported with human neural progenitors obtained from umbilical cord blood; however, no gfap expression could be detected in this experiment  <cit> . thus, phenotyping of neuron-like cells revealed that more than 80% of the initial cell population became differentiated and expressed neurological receptors after  <dig> days of induction. this time period was inferior when compared to neural stem cells produced from fetal brain in humans  <cit> , but similar to one study performed in dogs using wharton’s jelly source  <cit> .

the neurotropic rna and dna viruses that produce cns diseases in humans and animals use a variety of pathological mechanisms. for members of the α- herpesvirinae subfamily, almost all types and areas of the nervous system have been identified as targets for viral replication  <cit> . although many studies have been performed in vivo using rabbits and cattle, it is difficult to examine bohv- <dig> replication in vivo. an in vitro culture of rabbit sensory neurons and ganglionic non-neuron cells to examine bohv- <dig> replication  <cit> .

because of this difficulty, suitable in vitro systems implementing the three r’s principle of russel and burch  are needed to study primary host-virus interactions  <cit> . because of the clinical relevance of the α-subfamily herpesvirinae, in vitro models would be highly appreciated to replace animal studies. in addition to ethical considerations, in vitro studies would eliminate potential confounding factors such as individual animal variation and environmental factors  <cit> .

both herpes simplex virus  <dig>  and bohv-1/ <dig> establish lifelong latent infections in rabbit and cow sensory nerve ganglia  <cit> . several days after infection by hsv- <dig> and bohv-1/ <dig>  some neurons are productively infected   <cit> . other neurons, however, become latently infected  <cit> . in the present study, the absence of floating neuron-like cells following bohv- <dig> infection suggests a low rate of cell death. this was confirmed by mtt assay results showing high cell viability and 60% ish positivity. these findings can be explained by the expression of a latency-associated region  gene that is involved in neuronal survival during hsv- <dig> infection in vitro <cit> . in addition, in vitro replication does not always correlate with in vivo viral behavior. thus, it is particularly important to note that data obtained from in vitro studies are not necessarily representative of viral host interactions occurring in vivo <cit> .

however, the molecular mechanisms by which productive and persistent viruses produce nervous system diseases are diverse and not completely understood. the results obtained in this investigation open the door to questions about neuronal death/survival mechanisms following bohv- <dig> infection and replication.

CONCLUSIONS
this report provides the first characterization of neuron-like cells derived from bwj-mscs. we have demonstrated that these cells are susceptible to bohv- <dig> infection. these results open the door to replace animal models to study particular aspects of bohv- <dig> biology and pathogenesis. our in vitro model reduces the need for animal experimentation. the neuron-like cells developed herein can be used as a viable alternative to investigate several aspects of bohv- <dig> biology including neurotropism, neurovirulence, and gene expression.
