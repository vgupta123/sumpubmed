BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease  has been associated with severe productivity losses in cloven-hoofed animals characterised by vesicular lesions of the feet, tongue, snout and teats as well as fever and lameness
 <cit> . the disease has a serious impact upon food security, rural income and significant economic consequences for any country harbouring the virus
 <cit> . an integral part of any viral disease control strategy is the epidemiological tracing of virus transmission together with conventional field investigations. for rna viruses with high evolutionary rates, this is routinely achieved with the application of molecular and phylogenetic methods
 one example being the global tracing of foot-and-mouth disease virus 
 <cit> . next-generation sequencing platforms offer much promise as rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput methods for the generation of viral genome sequences. recovering whole genome consensus level sequences of viruses provides important information for outbreak epidemiology and pathogen identification
.

the positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of fmdv is comprised of a single long open reading frame. this encodes a polyprotein which is flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of approximately 1200 nt and 95 nt, respectively, terminating in a poly  tail. the 5′ utr contains highly structured rna which is involved in both replication and translation. approximately 300–370 nt from the 5′ end of the genome lies a homopolymeric cytidylic acid  tract of ~100-170 nt
 <cit> . the genome sequence upstream of the poly tract is known as the s fragment and that downstream as the l fragment.

previously, tracing and monitoring of the trans-boundary movements of fmdv has been successfully achieved using consensus sequences of the vp <dig> region
. however, over shorter epidemic time scales, where viral populations have not substantially diverged, vp <dig> sequencing cannot provide the required resolution to discriminate between viruses in field samples collected from neighbouring farms within outbreak clusters. at this scale, wgs at the consensus level has proven to be a powerful tool for the reconstruction of transmission trees
 <cit> .

previous strategies for viral wgs include pcr and sanger sequencing methods or microarray approaches
 <cit> . commonly, these processes have limited throughput and are both resource and labour-intensive with biased outputs that may not reflect the true diversity within samples
 <cit> . furthermore, such methodologies have been subject to errors incumbent within the nature of the protocol i.e. those protocols reliant upon dna amplification generate biased datasets from which it is difficult to make firm conclusions
 <cit> . such strategies have also been dependent upon a priori knowledge of virus sequences for primer design and are limited by potential inter and intra-sample sequence variation
 <cit> .

this study describes the optimisation of a robust, high-throughput protocol for wgs of all seven serotypes of fmdv excluding the 5′ genomic termini and poly tract. it does not use pcr amplification prior to the sequencing steps and overcomes the requirement for large starting quantities of template nucleic acid, which has previously limited the suitability of some ngs technologies for processing viral field isolates
. this protocol, with minor changes, was also applied to other polyadenylated rna viruses.

RESULTS
protocol accuracy: calculation of minimum coverage required for accurate consensus
next-generation sequencing analysis provided large numbers of short read sequences that were assembled and aligned in order to determine a consensus sequence. to define how much redundancy was required for accurate reconstruction of consensus level sequences, we determined the minimum read coverage required to obtain a robust consensus from the protocol described. analysis was completed on all fmdv type o samples with sufficient coverage . from this a mean was calculated showing a minimum coverage of  <dig> reads was required to obtain an accurate consensus sequence in this instance.figure  <dig> 
read coverage required to obtain an accurate consensus sequence. the consensus sequence resulting from varying levels of coverage was assessed for accuracy. isolates o/ukg/1450/ <dig> , o/ukg/1558/ <dig> , o/ukg/1734/ <dig> , o/ukg/4998/ <dig>  and o/ukg/14597/ <dig>  alongside the type o exemplar from the serotype panel  were analysed. points on the graph represent a comparison of the identities  of a consensus made with total reads and a consensus made with limited read coverage . on average, an identity score of one was maintained up to  a coverage limit of  <dig> reads. below this level of coverage, the accuracy of the identities of the compared consensus sequences decreased i.e. consensus sequences made with a depth of 22x reads were identical to the consensus. sequences created with less than 22x coverage depth were not identical, and therefore considered less accurate.



analytical sensitivity of wgs protocol: consensus sequence was obtained to 1 ×  <dig> virus genome copies
the protocol workflow  was optimised and tested using a single fmdv o/ukg/35/ <dig> isolate. initially, the sensitivity of the protocol in the presence of gdna  was tested against viral dilutions spanning 1 ×  <dig>  1 ×  <dig> and 1 ×  <dig> rna copies/μl. the total number of illumina reads in all five samples ranged between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> . consensus genome sequences  were created from alignments of these reads at each dilution. a decreasing percentage of viral reads correlated with decreasing viral load . consensus sequences were found to be identical in all cases both between individual samples and the reference sequence . for this isolate, whole genome sequence was attained  for 1 ×  <dig> and 1 ×  <dig> genomes copies/μl, however, below this level, coverage was incomplete. coverage was increased in regions adjacent to primer binding sites and was lowest in the s-fragment , notably in regions immediately adjacent to the poly tract. the 3’ genomic termini were obtained in the cell culture neat virus sample  with only  <dig> bases missing at the 5′ termini. in order to gain accurate consensus our analysis shows that for type o we needed a minimum viral read depth of  <dig>  by this criterion accurate consensus sequences were generated for > <dig> % of the genome, down to 1 ×  <dig> copies/μl. below this threshold  we observed a rapid drop-off in the coverage depth of genome sequences with average coverage across the genome dropping from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . furthermore both genomic termini, notably the 5′ end, were also lost with decreasing viral load.table  <dig>

different factors of library complexity including total number of reads, number of viral reads, coverage and mean coverage depth across the genome .



gdna depletion increases proportion of reads attributed to virus genome
we investigated the impact of genomic dna  depletion by rdnase <dig> treatment upon the final library complexity. removal of gdna was confirmed by qubit measurement before and after treatment . although the majority of dna in the sample was eliminated it should be noted that some residual dna remained in the sample. samples that had not been subjected to rdnase <dig> treatment contained increased total number of reads, compared to samples that had been treated with rdnase <dig> . however, a higher percentage of reads aligned with the reference template for gdna depleted samples compared to untreated samples .

validation of protocol on field samples of fmdv and reproducibility
five field samples submitted to the uk fmd national reference laboratory  during the uk  <dig> outbreak were tested using the sequencing protocol for ukg specific viruses as described above. virus load in all samples was quantified by real-time rt-qpcr . four of five samples  contained between  <dig>  ×  <dig> –  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies/μl. the remaining sample  was of lower viral loads with  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies/μl, respectively. the number of viral reads per sample varied between 1 ×  <dig>  and 1 ×  <dig> , potentially reflecting differences in viral load. reads were trimmed and aligned to a reference sequence fmdv o/ukg/35/ <dig> . all samples exhibited increased coverage at primer specific sites  and decreased coverage at the sites adjacent to the fmdv poly tract and at the 5′ termini of the s fragment. samples with viral load >1 ×  <dig> copies/μl exhibited >69% of reads aligning to the reference template. the sample with the lowest viral load, o/ukg/4998/ <dig>  resulted in  <dig> % of reads aligning to the template. complete genome sequences  were obtained for all samples. isolate o/ukg/1450/ <dig>  which exhibited the highest viral load and total numbers of reads, generated a coverage depth > <dig> across  <dig> % of the genome.

for the five samples that generated a whole genome sequence, the coverage across the l fragment was even, peaking in regions of reverse transcription primer binding . all genome sequences have been submitted to genbank . to evaluate reproducibility, one isolate  was sequenced  <dig> separate times. analysis was completed on each of these  <dig> repeats and no changes in the consensus sequence produced were observed.figure  <dig> 
application of protocol to field isolates from  <dig>  coverage of between 1000– <dig> x was achieved for 4/ <dig> ukg  <dig> isolates , o/ukg/1558/ <dig> , o/ukg/1734/ <dig>  and o/ukg/14597/ <dig> ) with a drop in coverage at the poly tract . o/ukg/4998/ <dig>  showed lower coverage of between 10-100x. primer locations are shown as black arrowheads above the genome illustration.



application to cell culture negative fmdv
a diagnostic virus sample o/isr/2/ <dig>  submitted to the wrlfmd in  <dig>  was sequenced using the whole genome sequencing protocol. the virus could not be isolated in cell culture, but fmdv rna was detected with diagnostic real-time reverse transcription-quantitative pcr  and quantified as  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies/μl . the majority of the genome sequence was generated  with several gaps evident across the genome length .

pan-fmdv application of wgs protocol
after validation with fmdv ukg field samples the protocol was used to determine whole genome sequences for a panel of rna viruses representing each of the seven fmdv serotypes . in order to optimise the protocol we replaced the type o specific primer ‘4926r’ with a pan-fmdv primer ‘nk-72’ designed to bind a region conserved between all seven fmdv serotypes . the panel had a viral load >1 ×  <dig> copies/μl. de-novo assemblies were completed to provide a consensus against which all reads were aligned. all viruses gave similar depth of coverage  and exhibited comparable library complexity with the exception of sat  <dig> whose depth of coverage was reduced  . the 5′ genomic termini was also missing from all panel viruses ranging from  <dig> bases of a and asia <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for sat  <dig>  sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and o respectively .figure  <dig> 
genome coverage profiles for fmdv serotype panel. sequence data coverage at each position along the genome is shown for serotype o , a , asia  <dig> , c , sat  <dig> , sat  <dig> , and sat  <dig> . the majority of the coverage is above 1000x. in all viruses tested, a poly tract within the fmdv genome at ~375 bp was associated in a reduction in coverage. the coverage depth observed for sat  <dig> was lower than other serotypes. primer locations are shown as black arrowheads above the genome illustration.

application to non-fmdv rna viruses
in order to demonstrate the suitability of this method to attain whole genome sequence from other poly tailed rna viruses, we tested the protocol upon three different viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus  <dig>  equine rhinitis a virus  <dig>  and vesicular exanthema of swine virus b <dig>  . for all three viruses, first-strand cdna synthesis was performed using the 3′ oligo-dt primer ‘rev 6’ and sequence-specific primers replacing the pan-fmdv specific nk <dig> . the complete genome sequence, apart from the poly tract was determined for emcv- <dig> atcc vr-129b . the complete genome sequence, apart from 100+ nt at the 5′ end of the genome was determined for erav- <dig> d1305- <dig> . similarly, the majority of the calicivirus vesv-b <dig> genome was determined apart from six nt at the 5′ end of the genome .figure  <dig> 
genome coverage profiles for three non-fmdv panel of viruses. coverage of  <dig>  was achieved for the majority of the emcv- <dig> genome . peaks in coverage can be observed at the location of sequence specific primers used in the rt reaction . a dip in coverage was evident at the poly tract. the erav- <dig> genome showed between 10x and 100x coverage with visible peaks in coverage at the specific primer sites  . approximately 100x coverage of the majority of the vesv-b <dig> genome was achieved .



discussion
we have described a novel sample preparation method incorporating minimal amplification for the accurate sequencing of rna viruses to a consensus level, using an illumina miseq. this protocol is an affordable and reproducible method to generate whole genome sequences for fmdv and other rna viruses, which could be adapted to routine high-throughput diagnostic laboratory workflows. the protocol was validated using fmdv type o  and shown to be applicable to all other serotypes of fmdv   as well as other picornaviruses  and a calicivirus  .

we have shown that the protocol is able to produce whole genome sequences from samples with viral loads as low as 1 ×  <dig> virus rna copies per μl. further validation was performed with five samples submitted during the uk  <dig> fmdv outbreak. the generation of five genomes from these samples, without pcr amplification or virus culture, demonstrated the potential for this method to investigate larger outbreak sample sets in a high-throughput, diagnostic setting, such as the uk  <dig> fmdv outbreak.

pcr processes have previously been shown to be error prone
 <cit>  and thus eradication of this step has the opportunity to improve the quality of the data. our protocol differs from previous studies in the literature through inclusion of sequence specific primers, as opposed to random priming at the first strand cdna stage
 <cit> . this decision was made with the intent of maximising coverage, across the whole genome, specifically for fmdv; although it is possible that primer induced bias could be introduced into sequences through use of sequence specific primers.

we have also demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting this method for wgs of other rna viruses . we foresee this protocol being practicable for unknown positive sense polyadenylated viruses through use of random primers and, where appropriate, an oligo-dt primer.

the specificity previously provided by pcr has been replaced with reduction of host dna and the optional use of specific primers in the reverse transcription reaction. instead of enriching viral rna we depleted host genomic dna. we did not target ribosomal rna in order to keep reagent costs low thus maintaining the suitability of the protocol for ‘high-throughput’ sample processing. the method described here was capable of generating whole genome sequences of fmdv field isolates with a coverage depth of up to 1 ×  <dig>  that was considered sufficient for the study of minority variants
 <cit> , with only a minimal amount of pcr at the library preparation stage. this pcr amplification involved 10 cycles of amplification by a hi-fidelity dna polymerase, thereby posing minimal risk to biasing the final sequence data
 <cit> .

it was evident that in genome sequences generated using this protocol the genomic termini and poly tract exhibited lower coverage depths. the 5′ genomic termini were always under-represented within the genomes. this was particularly evident in samples of decreased viral load suggesting that increasing the input rna of such samples could improve this coverage. additionally homopolymeric regions, such as the long poly tract of fmdv, have been demonstrated here to cause significant decreases in coverage. with sanger sequencing, large parts of the genome are often missing or primer derived. for example, twenty seven to fifty nucleotides of the full genome sequences obtained by sanger sequencing described by valdazo-gonzalez et al.,
 were primer derived  and thus the method described here offers a notable improvement on the resolution of these regions. as previously stated, a minimum read depth of coverage required to create an accurate consensus for a type o sequence was on average  <dig> . even after implementation of this criterion, consensus sequences were generated with a depth of > <dig>  at more than  <dig> % genome positions. this was observed in the  <dig> ukg field isolates tested and > <dig> % for type o virus tested as part of the panel of serotypes .

such advances in wgs will likely impact fields such as virus evolution, diagnosis, and generation of high/low pathogenicity variants. we have already shown this method can be advantageous in a diagnostic setting with the successful sequencing of  <dig> % of the genome of a culture negative field isolate. fmdv reads were successfully identified although the resulting profile exhibits several gaps in the genome sequence suggesting that the rna was in fact degraded - an observation potentially explaining the inability for this virus to grow successfully in cell culture. for this protocol to be fully functional within a diagnostic environment, it remains to be confirmed whether it is able to correctly identify all viruses or serotypes within mixed samples.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper outlines the development of a high-throughput protocol for the generation of whole genome sequences of all seven serotypes of fmdv. with minimal changes applied to priming in the first strand synthesis stage such a strategy can be tailored to other rna viruses. the application of ngs to virology will prove invaluable to the fields of molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic outbreak tracing. this paper describes a fast, robust and affordable protocol, which is essential to realise this potential.
