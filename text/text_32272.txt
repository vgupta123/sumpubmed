BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are alternative bases at any given position of dna. they are among the most abundant type of genetic variations and widely distributed within genomes. theoretically, snps can have four alleles in the population, but they most often exist as bi-allelic markers. because of their potential for high genotyping efficiency, automation, data quality, genome-wide coverage and analytical simplicity  <cit> , snps have rapidly become the marker of choice for many applications in genetics and genomics. in particular, snps are most suitable for whole genome association studies because linkage disequilibrium can be detected with high density snp coverage of the genome when working with performance and production traits. for instance, simultaneous analysis of thousands of snps have enabled genome-wide association studies for complex traits in chicken  <cit> , pig  <cit>  cattle  <cit>  horse  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> . however, such studies have not been possible with most aquaculture species including catfish because large numbers of snps have not been available.

in species where the whole genome has been sequenced, snps have been identified from genome sequencing efforts. in most cases, snps were identified by sequence variations between the two alleles of a single diploid individual whose genome was sequenced  <cit> . more recently, the identification of snps in non-model species has been fuelled by mining large numbers of expressed sequence tags  available in many species. likewise, gene-associated snps derived from ests have been identified in several fish species, including atlantic salmon  <cit> , atlantic cod  <cit>  and catfish  <cit> . in spite of being relatively effective, snp identification from ests is limited by sequence coverage and depth. for instance, of the  <dig>  putative snps identified from catfish ests, only  <dig>  were identified from contigs containing at least four ests and at least two sequences bearing the minor allele. a majority of the catfish est contigs  contain only two or three sequences  <cit> . putative snps identified from such contigs would have the minor alleles represented by only one sequence. such snps could represent sequence errors and therefore, are not reliable  <cit> .

to identify larger numbers of gene-associated snps, higher throughput expressed sequence reads are needed to increase coverage and depth and ensure sequence accuracy. next generation sequencing technologies such as roche/ <dig>  illumina/solexa, and abi/solid sequencing platforms are particularly adapted to producing high coverage of expressed sequences within contigs  <cit> . transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing with multiple individuals has been demonstrated to be very effective for snp identification  <cit> . recently,  <dig> sequencing was applied for the identification of gene-derived snps in a number of species such as eucalyptus grandis  <cit> , pine tree  <cit> , butterfly  <cit> , lake sturgeon  <cit>  and coral  <cit> .

while the  <dig> sequencing technology has been widely used for transcriptome analysis, illumina sequencing technology is being gradually accepted for its dramatically improved sequencing throughput and quality  <cit> . paired-end sequencing technology along with the longer sequence reads make it possible to assemble contigs of transcripts from illumina short reads. such assemblies are aided by the presence of reference genome and/or reference transcriptome sequences  <cit> . in this context, a large number of ests of catfish are available. the objective of this study is to conduct transcriptome sequencing from multiple individuals of both channel catfish  and blue catfish  in order to identify gene-associated snps for the development of snp arrays in catfish.

RESULTS
generation of expressed short reads
illumina sequencing was conducted to generate short sequence reads of expressed sequences. two cdna libraries were made from pooled rna samples prepared from a total of  <dig> tissues of  <dig> channel catfish and  <dig> blue catfish, respectively, representing major strains used in commercial production. the cdnas were sequenced with one lane each using illumina ga-ii and illumina hiseq  <dig> that generated  <dig>  million 36-bp paired-end reads and  <dig>  million 100-bp paired-end reads for channel catfish, and  <dig>  million 36-bp paired-end reads and  <dig>  million 100-bp paired-end reads for blue catfish . after removal of ambiguous nucleotides, low-quality sequences  and sequences less than  <dig> bp, sequences totaling  <dig>  billion base pairs for channel catfish and  <dig>  billion base pairs for blue catfish were generated .

eleven tissues were used for rna preparation including brain, gill, head kidney, intestine, liver, muscle, skin, spleen, stomach, heart, and trunk kidney. *paired-end reads were generated in different lengths of either  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp as a result of different sequencers, illumina ga-ii or hiseq  <dig> 

assembly of the expressed short reads
assembly of the expressed short reads was conducted in several ways. first, reference assemblies of channel catfish expressed short reads and blue catfish expressed short reads were conducted separately using all existing catfish ests as a reference. such assemblies would allow establishment of contigs for channel catfish expressed short reads and blue catfish expressed short reads separately to allow identification of intra-specific snps that are anchored  by longer est reference sequences. such an assembly is superior to the total de novo assembly of the expressed short reads which generates very large numbers of contigs, over  <dig>  . as shown in table  <dig>  over two thirds of the expressed short reads were assembled with the reference assemblies. over  <dig> million reads of channel catfish  and  <dig> million reads of blue catfish  were assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively. the contigs were reasonably long with an average contig length of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, for channel catfish and blue catfish .

despite generating an efficient reference assembly, over  <dig> million channel catfish reads and  <dig> million blue catfish reads were not assembled with the reference assembly. these reads could represent additional genes that were not represented by the est reference sequences, or they could come from gene regions that were not represented by the est references. in order to make them useful resources for snp identification, de novo assembly of these remaining reads was conducted. as shown in table  <dig>  over 70% of these unassembled expressed short reads could be assembled de novo, generating  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  contigs for channel catfish and blue catfish, respectively. however, the average contig length was much shorter than those in the reference assembly, with  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for channel catfish and blue catfish, respectively. these contigs are also useful resources for the identification of intra-specific snps.

all the newly generated expressed short reads were first assembled using reference assembly , and those that were not assembled, i.e., they did not align in silico to the existing catfish ests, were used for the de novo assembly. *number of reads per contig. #total number of assembled read bases/total number of bases in consensus sequence.

after separate analyses of channel catfish and blue catfish expressed short reads, reference and de novo assemblies were conducted using combined channel catfish and blue catfish expressed short reads in order to identify inter-specific snps. a total of  <dig>  million expressed short reads from both channel catfish and blue catfish  were used. the reference assembly of all catfish expressed short reads placed  <dig>  million reads  into  <dig>  contigs, with an average contig length of  <dig> bp. similarly, the de novo assembly of all catfish expressed short reads generated  <dig>  contigs, with an average contig length of  <dig> bp . these contigs should be useful for the identification of inter-specific snps.

putative gene identity and annotation
before snp identification, we conducted analysis of putative gene identities to help assess how many genes may be included in the assemblies. to determine the putative gene identities, unique consensus sequences from the all catfish reference assembly and de novo assembly were searched against the uniprot database and ncbi zebrafish refseq protein database using blastx with a cutoff e-value of 1e- <dig>  of  <dig>  all catfish contigs from the reference assembly,  <dig>   had blast hits to the uniprot database, and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. as expected, a lower percentage of the contigs from de novo assembly had blast hits to uniprot proteins. of the  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   had blast hits to the uniprot database, with matches to  <dig>  unique proteins. altogether, of the  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   had significant blast hits to the unitprot database, and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. larger numbers of contig hits but fewer matches to unique proteins were observed when compared to the zebrafish refseq protein database . altogether,  <dig>   had blast hits to known proteins in zebrafish refseq protein database that matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. this seemingly low percentage of contigs with blast hits is partially due to a high proportion of short contigs in the assembly of expressed short reads, although the percentage of the unique proteins of zebrafish hit by the unique catfish sequences in this study is comparable to levels reported in our previous catfish est project  <cit> . longer contigs were more likely to have blast hits to the annotated protein databases, 80% of our contigs with blast hits were over  <dig> bp in length , similar to observations in previous studies  <cit> . nonetheless, blast searches identified a total of  <dig>  unique protein accessions including  <dig>  genes that were identified for the first time here from the catfish transcriptome.

contigs of two assemblies, the reference assembly with  <dig>  contigs and the de novo assembly with  <dig>  contigs, were used to search the uniprot database and the zebrafish refseq protein database to assess the number of related genes represented by catfish expressed sequences.

to assess the coverage of the catfish transcriptome achieved by our sequencing effort, the distribution of gene ontology  annotations in catfish was compared with that of zebrafish.

the unique genes from the catfish and the zebrafish annotated database were analyzed using generic go-slim terms with blast2go  <cit> . the percentages of annotated catfish sequences assigned to go-slim terms are very similar to those of zebrafish genes , suggesting a generally similar distribution of genes in different functional categories, and the depth of the coverage of the transcriptome.

snp identification
as summarized in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig> intra-specific putative snps were identified from the channel catfish sequence assembly;  <dig> , <dig> intra-specific putative snps were identified from the blue catfish sequence assembly; and  <dig> , <dig> putative snps were identified from the all catfish sequence assembly . almost two thirds of the putative snps were transitions.

putative snps include all base variations involved in the sequence assemblies with at least four sequences present at the snp position with minor allele sequences represented at least twice. all catfish represents both intra-specific and inter-specific snps. note that the total snps from all catfish assembly is fewer than the sum of total snps from channel catfish and blue catfish due to shared snp positions in the two catfish species.

our previous research suggested that snps identified from contigs with at least four sequences at the snp sites with the minor allele being represented at least twice are more reliable  <cit> . in this study, putative snps were further screened following specific criteria based on the read depth, minor allele frequency, the quality of flanking regions and absence of additional snps in the 15-bp flanking regions . with these criteria, a total of  <dig>  putative filtered snps were identified from channel catfish;  <dig>  putative filtered snps were identified for blue catfish ; of these  <dig>  putative filtered snps were identified from same positions in both channel catfish and blue catfish, while  <dig>  putative filtered inter-specific snps were identified . the number of intra-specific snps identified from same positions in both channel catfish and blue catfish may be underestimated, due to failure to capture sequences from one or both species in the current sequence data. a total of  <dig>  filtered intra-specific snps in channel catfish were identified from positions where there were fewer than four blue catfish sequences, and similarly,  <dig>  filtered intra-specific snps in blue catfish were identified from positions where there were fewer than four channel catfish sequences . obviously, the failure to obtain sequences from one or both species at same positions would also cause the underrepresentation of inter-specific snps.

1snps identified at positions where there were snps within channel catfish; 2snps identified at positions where there were snps within blue catfish; 3snps identified at positions where there were no intra-specific channel catfish snps or intra-specific blue catfish snps, but the bases differed between the two species.

since the information on minor allele frequency  is an important consideration in choosing which snps to be included in snp arrays, the minor allele frequencies of snps in the discovery populations were estimated from the sequence data. as shown in figure  <dig>  the majority of snps have sequence derived minor allele frequencies more than 15%, and the average mafs were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in putative filtered snps identified for channel catfish, blue catfish and inter-species, respectively .

while the number of snps is important, their distribution in contigs and genes within the genome is also important when used for genetic analysis. a total of  <dig>  channel catfish contigs and  <dig>  blue catfish contigs were found to contain putative filtered snps, of which  <dig>  contigs contain snps at same positions in both channel catfish and blue catfish. the number of unique uniprot accessions hit by contigs containing snps was  <dig>  for channel catfish, and  <dig>  for blue catfish, suggesting that putative filtered snps were identified from the vast majority of catfish genes.

one important aspect of using the inter-specific hybrid system is to identify inter-specific snps. from this work, a total of  <dig>  contigs were identified to contain  <dig>  inter-specific snps, i.e., sequence variations between the two species, channel catfish and blue catfish. these snps were from at least  <dig>  distinct genes as determined by unique hits to the uniprot protein database .

microsatellite markers identification
the  <dig>  catfish contigs were surveyed to identify microsatellite markers. a total of  <dig>  microsatellites were initially identified from  <dig>  contigs. the majority of the microsatellites are dinucleotide repeats . of these microsatellites,  <dig>  distributed within  <dig>  contigs had sufficient flanking sequences on both sides for primer design. these microsatellites should be useful for genetic linkage mapping and other genetic studies.

assessment of snp distribution
snps distribution along the chromosomes of a genome is important for consideration of genome coverage using snp markers. in the absence of a whole genome sequence assembly in catfish, we have taken a comparative genomic approach to plot the snps from expressed sequences onto the zebrafish genome sequence assembly. contigs containing snps were used as queries against zebrafish transcripts to plot their putative genomic locations based on homology. as shown in figure  <dig>  the catfish expressed snps represent genes that are widely distributed along the chromosomes of all  <dig> zebrafish chromosomes. there are few gaps over one million base pairs in this comparative alignment .

discussion
in this work, we have conducted rna-seq analysis with pooled rna samples from multiple individuals of both channel catfish and blue catfish to develop large numbers of high-quality snps. a total of  <dig>  million reads allowed generation of a total of over  <dig> billion base pairs of expressed sequences. previous to this report, a total of approximately  <dig> million base pairs of expressed sequences of catfish had been generated using traditional sanger sequencing. this work represents more than  <dig> times more transcript sequences than the total previously submitted to genbank. our results demonstrate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of next generation sequencing technologies in generating expressed sequences.

one great challenge of using illumina sequencing for transcriptome analysis is the short read length. in this study, we have used both the illumina ga-ii and hiseq  <dig> sequencing platforms that generated read lengths of  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp. de novo assembly of the expressed short reads proved to be problematic even with gene-associated sequences. for instance, a total de novo assembly of the  <dig>  million short reads from channel catfish would lead to over  <dig>  contigs. similarly, de novo assembly of  <dig>  million short reads from blue catfish would lead to over  <dig> , <dig> contigs. such large numbers of short contigs may make subsequent applications of the est or snp resources less effective. however, such challenges are significantly alleviated when a large est resource is available, as demonstrated by drastic reduction of contig numbers with the reference assembly in this study.

a second challenge is the over representation of highly expressed gene tags in transcriptome analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  a small number of contigs  accounted for  <dig> % of total reads. clearly, there is a huge proportion of repeated sequencing and over representation of abundantly expressed genes. obviously, this problem can be reduced by normalization of the cdna. however, when a good est reference is available, such a seemingly large problem is not as serious as the numbers indicate. as shown in table  <dig>  blast analysis of the reference assembly and de novo assembly contigs revealed that  <dig>  unique uniprot accessions were represented, suggesting that the expressed short reads provided good coverage of the catfish transcriptome. additionally, previous, extensive est sequencing of normalized and subtracted cdna libraries resulted in  <dig>  unique consensus sequences from channel catfish and blue catfish. our sequencing here covered  <dig>  of those contigs , produced significant hits to  <dig>  previously uncaptured genes, and covered thousands of additional transcript regions currently without annotation.

pooling of rna samples from multiple individuals followed by transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing is among the most efficient methods for snp identification. through many years of efforts, a total of approximately  <dig>  putative catfish snps were previously identified  <cit> . however, this study alone allowed identification of over  <dig> million snps from channel catfish and almost  <dig>  million snps from blue catfish. this efficiency is even more obvious when considering filtered  snps. while only  <dig>  filtered snps were identified among all catfish ests  <cit> , this work resulted in  <dig>  filtered snps within channel catfish and  <dig>  within blue catfish. in addition, more than  <dig>  filtered snps were identified as inter-specific snps, and are valuable in genetics and breeding studies involving hybrid catfish.

one major challenge for snps is the problem caused by paralogous sequence variants  and multisite sequence variants   <cit> . putative snps detected may be false positives, potentially arising from sequencing errors or misassembly of psvs or msvs. paralogs that share high levels of sequence similarity may have been assembled in the same contig due to the short read length of illumina reads. a higher stringency of assembly may better discriminate between paralogs, but complete discrimination may prove to be difficult due to the lack of a reference genome sequence. on the other hand, a higher stringency of assembly would lead to the separate assembly of haplotypes from highly polymorphic genes  <cit> . therefore, in order to select snps with high confidence, putative snps were screened based on several factors including surrounding sequence quality, absence of additional snps in the flanking regions, sequence depth and minor allele frequency. snps detected within contigs or regions of high sequence depth are more likely to be false positives. therefore, setting a minimum minor allele frequency  for larger contigs may help reduce false snp calling based on sequence errors. additionally, multiple snps located close to one another  often represent sequence errors and prevent the design of primers and probes for snp genotyping. a requirement of no additional snps in the 15-bp flanking region around a putative snp was therefore applied.

given the large numbers of snps generated that meet these minimal requirements, more stringent parameters can be applied in picking snp sets for different applications. average depth at putative snp positions is greater than  <dig> sequences, providing high confidence in accuracy of identified snps within the pooled samples. re-sequencing or limited validation of these samples by low-throughput snp genotyping is costly and is unlikely to generate additional information. ultimately, snps need to be validated by genotyping in a variety of reference mapping families and trait-selected populations using a high-density screening array. in catfish, the use of homozygous gynogenetic catfish  <cit>  as controls will allow detection of false positives caused by psvs or msvs.

genome-wide association studies of complex traits require a large number of snps. however, for research communities focused on non-model organisms, it is cost-prohibitive to genotype all snps in an association study with the throughput of current technologies. selection of uniformly distributed snps across the genome for association studies is therefore very important  <cit> . gene-associated snps identified in this study, as anticipated, appear to be widely distributed across the catfish genome based on comparative analysis with zebrafish. about 30% of all contigs with identified snps had one snp and 66% had three or fewer snps per contig . in absence of a whole genome assembly, the assessment of the exact pattern of the snp distribution in the catfish genome is not possible. however, when the contigs containing filtered snps were plotted to the zebrafish genome by blast analysis, they had a good coverage of all regions of all  <dig> zebrafish chromosomes . while chromosome breakage, fusions, and rearrangements between catfish and zebrafish have occurred during genome evolution, at the genomic scale it is reasonable to assume that these widely distributed genes in the zebrafish genome will have a similar genomic distribution in catfish.

CONCLUSIONS
the approach to sample animals of diverse genetic backgrounds and sequence to sufficient depth for reliable snp identification allowed the ability to detect many common snps across the entire genome. we have demonstrated that transcriptome analysis of pooled rna samples from multiple individuals using illumina sequencing technology is both technically efficient and cost-effective for generating expressed sequences. such an approach is most effective when coupled to existing est resources generated using traditional sequencing approaches because the reference ests facilitate effective assembly of the expressed short reads. the snps identified in this report will provide a much needed resource for genetic studies in the catfish scientific community and will contribute to the development of high density, cost-effective genotyping platforms. validation and testing of snps using high-density arrays will subsequently lead to the production of a snp array with well-spaced snps providing a powerful genotyping tool for the study of performance and production traits in catfish.
