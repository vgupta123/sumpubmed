BACKGROUND
nitrogen  is the most important inorganic nutrient for plant growth. the production of high-yielding crops is associated with the application of large quantities of n fertilizers  <cit> . the addition of n fertilizer is typically the single highest input cost for many crops and since its production is energy intensive, this cost is dependent on the price of energy  <cit> . incorporation of n into agricultural crops, however, rarely exceeds 40% of the applied n, indicating a serious inefficiency in n utilization  <cit> . the remaining n from fertilizer is lost to the atmosphere or leached to the groundwater and other freshwater bodies, which is causing serious n pollution and becoming a threat to global ecosystems  <cit> . therefore, to minimize the loss of n, reduce environmental pollution and decrease input cost, it is crucial to develop crop varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency   <cit> .

while improved agricultural practice is one way to increase nue  <cit> , it is also crucial to understand more about the genetics of nue in order to select better varieties. several studies have presented evidence that natural variation exists in arabidopsis for nitrogen metabolism, including nitrogen uptake and nitrogen remobilization . genetic differences in n uptake and/or grain yield per unit of n applied have also been reported in different crops including wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, and barley  <cit> .

maize is one of the most important crops cultivated worldwide and a large amount of fertilizer is used for its production. genetic variation in maize such as in n-remobilization and post-silking n-uptake, nitrogen metabolism, nitrogen management, and senescence have been reported  <cit> . although some physiological and phenotypic analyses have been done  <cit> , the molecular knowledge governing genetic variation among different varieties for nue is poorly understood. in a previous study, we developed a hydroponic growth system and tested two inbred lines and their hybrid that were different in their nue at maturity under n limitation  <cit> . one parent, srg <dig>  showed a higher nue than the other parent srg <dig>  differences between these genetic lines were found after phenotypic, molecular, and metabolic factors were tested at an early vegetative stage and transcriptional analysis on a small number of selected genes involved in n metabolism was conducted  <cit> . to have a better understanding of how different maize genotypes respond to n limitation, we used whole transcriptome sequencing  to conduct a survey of the transcriptomes of these srg <dig>  srg <dig>  and their hybrid under sufficient and limiting n conditions. the primary objectives of this study were to observe the major differences in gene expression among these three lines responding to n limitation, to distinguish the contribution of each parental line to gene expression in the hybrid line, and to discover whether these differences in expression correlate with the differences in the nue trait studied.

RESULTS
transcriptomes of the two inbred parental lines and the hybrid line under sufficient and limiting n conditions
the two inbred lines, srg <dig> and srg <dig>  and the hybrid line, srg <dig>  were grown under sufficient  and limiting  n conditions as described previously  <cit> . to profile the transcriptome, mrna from leaves and roots of srg <dig>  srg <dig>  and srg <dig> plants grown under the two n conditions were extracted, fragmented, and used for cdna synthesis. libraries were constructed and mrna-seq was performed . 64-79% of total paired reads were aligned to the b <dig> reference genome  and aligned sequences were assembled with cufflinks guided by a reference annotation from ensembl genomes . the completed assembly contains  <dig>  genes , the set of evidence-based and predicted genes, has  <dig>  genes, and the filtered gene set , a subset of the wgs, has  <dig>  genes). the percentage of mapped reads, genes with fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads  >  <dig>  >  <dig>  or >   <dig> are summarized in table  <dig>  a transcript was considered to be expressed if its normalized expression value was greater than one fpkm  <cit> , and if it was part of the fgs version 5b. <dig> . more genes were expressed under n limitation than under sufficient n, with a 4-8% higher number if the fpkm cutoff is greater than  <dig>  and with a 9-26% higher number if fpkm cutoff is greater than  <dig> . the original datasets have been deposited in the sequence read archive , with the accession id srp <dig> and the following link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=srp <dig> 

identification of differentially expressed genes in leaves and roots of the three genotypes under limiting n conditions
pairwise comparisons were made within root or leaf tissue of each genotype between the sufficient and low nitrogen conditions. differentially expressed  genes were identified if the fpkm for a gene was greater than  <dig> in at least one of the two conditions being compared and the p-value after adjusting for false discovery was less than  <dig> . with these criteria,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed in srg <dig>  srg <dig>  and srg <dig> leaves, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> up-regulated and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> down-regulated under n limitation, respectively . in the roots,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed in srg <dig>  srg <dig>  and srg <dig>  with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> down-regulated, respectively, under n limiting conditions . as the srg <dig> genome has more similarity to the b <dig> genome, the expression of some srg <dig> de genes  were selected and tested by qrt-pcr. the results verified what we observed from the rna_seq data . gene ontology  functional enrichment analysis was performed using singular enrichment analysis  on agrigo  <cit>  with the  <dig> gene lists from each of the six sufficient n to low n pairwise comparisons . a cross comparison of sea  on agrigo  <cit>  was then performed to compare the go terms enriched either in leaf or in root for up-regulated or down-regulated genes. in leaf samples,  <dig> go terms were enriched in the list of genes up-regulated in response to n limitation for srg <dig>  two of these terms were organic acid transport  and carboxylic acid transport  . none were enriched in the up-regulated gene list for srg <dig>  for srg <dig>   <dig> go terms were enriched in the up-regulated gene list, including many biological processes important for n metabolism such as the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process  and the cellular amino acid metabolic process  .  <dig> go terms were over-represented in the down-regulated gene list for srg <dig>  including photosynthesis ; photosynthesis, light harvesting ; photosynthesis, light reaction ; cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process  and the polysaccharide metabolic process  . four were enriched in the down-regulated gene list for srg <dig>   <dig> go terms were enriched in the down-regulated gene list for srg <dig>  including go terms enriched for srg <dig> such as the carbohydrate metabolic process , and some go terms were only over-represented in the hybrid, such as the response to stress  and to abiotic stimulus  .

in roots,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> go terms were enriched, respectively, among genes up-regulated in response to n limitation for srg <dig>  srg <dig>  and srg <dig>  with some of these enriched in all three genotypes . some go terms were only enriched in the two parents or in srg <dig> and srg <dig>  and other go terms were enriched only in srg <dig>  such as anion transport go:0006820) and ion transport  .  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> go terms were enriched respectively in the genes down-regulated in response to n limitation for srg <dig>  srg <dig>  and srg <dig>  the terms photosynthesis ; photosynthesis, light harvesting ; photosynthesis, light reaction  were down-regulated in all three genotypes, although the number of genes enriched in these groups was different, with the hybrid having the smallest number . again, some go terms were enriched in the two parents such as generation of precursor metabolites and energy , or in srg <dig> and srg <dig>  such as gene expression  and cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process  . other go terms were enriched only in srg <dig> such as regulation of gene expression , regulation of primary metabolic process , and regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process  .

to have an overview of the major differences among these differentially expressed genes in the three genotypes, we first took the differentially expressed gene lists in leaves and uploaded these to the pathway tools omics viewers from the gramene website . it is clear that many different pathways were involved even with the limited set of differentially expressed genes . some examples include the sugar transporter, carbohydrate transporter, monosaccharide transporter, glucose transporter and sorbitol transporter pathways which were up-regulated in srg <dig> under n limitation, but not in srg <dig> and srg <dig> . also of note was the up-regulation of the cytokinin degradation pathway in srg <dig>  but not in the two parental lines .

the differentially expressed gene lists in roots were also uploaded to the pathway tools omics viewers. the patterns in the roots differed from those in the leaves . as an example, the sugar transporter, carbohydrate transporter, and monosaccharide transporter pathways were up-regulated in srg <dig> under n limitation, not significantly changed in srg <dig>  but were down-regulated in srg <dig> . also, the cytokinin degradation pathway was down-regulated in srg <dig> roots .

assessment of additive expression in the hybrid
one of the primary purposes of this study was to determine if transcript levels in the hybrid resembled one inbred more than the other. the dominance-to-additive effects  ratio is conventionally used to compare trait values between hybrids and inbreds to determine the mode of inheritance. we used a modified version of this ratio as described in guo et al.  <cit>  to compare hybrid transcript expression levels relative to levels in srg <dig> and srg <dig> to determine if overall gene expression levels in the hybrid resemble one parent over the other. details are described in the methods section. schematic diagrams of potential patterns of hybrid gene expression are shown in figure 3a.

the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test if the mean of genes’ d/a ratios significantly deviated from  <dig>  the results showed that transcript expression levels in the hybrid were significantly skewed towards srg <dig> . genes were divided into  <dig> lists: genes with d/a ratios below − <dig>  genes with d/a ratios between − <dig> and  <dig>  genes with d/a ratios between  <dig> and  <dig>  and genes with d/a ratios above  <dig>  respectively, for low n in leaves, low n in roots, sufficient n in leaves, and sufficient n in roots. gene ontology functional enrichment analysis was performed using agrigo  <cit>  on the  <dig> gene lists individually . seacompare by agrigo was performed to contrast the go terms enriched under different n conditions either in leaf or in root. it is clear from the analysis that leaf and root tissue responded differently to n limitation. many more go terms were enriched in the group of genes with expression levels skewed towards srg <dig> under n limitation in leaf while more go terms were enriched in roots under sufficient n conditions . it is also clear that there are different expression patterns for certain groups of genes under the two n conditions . expression patterns in the hybrid can resemble one parent in one n treatment and the other parent in another n treatment. the examples for these include go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig> , which is clearly seen in leaf , but not in root . some go terms were enriched under sufficient n in the group of genes with hybrid expression levels similar to either srg <dig> and srg <dig> but were only enriched in the group of genes with hybrid expression levels skewed towards srg <dig> under low n conditions, e.g. photosynthesis , photosynthesis light harvesting  in leaf , and cellular carbohydrate metabolic process  in root . some groups of genes in the hybrid were expressed at levels between midparent and srg <dig>  under sufficient n condition, but had more genes expressed at levels outside the srg <dig> range under low n condition , e.g. gene expression  in leaf , and carbohydrate metabolic process  in root . some go terms were only enriched under low n conditions with expression skewed towards srg <dig> such as phosphate metabolic process , cellular amino acid metabolic process , photosynthesis, light reaction  in leaf , while some go terms were only enriched under sufficient n conditions with expression skewed towards srg <dig> such as cellular amino acid metabolic process , glutamine family amino acid metabolic process  in root . as we know from our previous results under n limitation srg <dig> responded more similarly to srg <dig> rather than srg <dig> and glutamine metabolic process always plays an important role in nue; these results support the notion that the differences in expression correlate well with the differences in the nue traits in these lines.

identification of allelic expression in the hybrid
as parental genetic diversity serves as the basis of heterosis, we investigated genes for which the level of expression from each parental allele differed in the hybrid. to do this, we assembled de novo transcriptomes for srg <dig> and srg <dig> and called snps between the transcriptomes.  <dig>  snps were found and used to determine differential allele expression in the hybrid at fgs genes with mean read depths greater than  <dig> reads per snp in the hybrid sample. the number of genes with differential allele expression varied depending on tissue and nitrogen status . in general, a higher percentage of genes exhibited differential allele expression under the sufficient nitrogen condition in both leaves and roots. srg <dig> alleles tended to be consistently more highly expressed than srg <dig> alleles in leaves but not in roots. finally, a large proportion of genes showing differential allele expression in the low nitrogen sample also showed this in the sufficient nitrogen sample .

in root samples both parental alleles had similar probabilities of exhibiting the more highly expressed allele for genes with differential allele expression. however, the go terms represented from the sets of parental alleles differ significantly . the details of these genes are listed in additional file  <dig>  in leaves, the cellular n compound metabolic process  was enriched for the hybrid regardless of which parental allele was more highly expressed under sufficient n condition, but was only enriched in the hybrid when the srg <dig> allele was more highly expressed under the low n condition . the hexose metabolic process  and glucose metabolic process  were enriched in the hybrid when expressing srg <dig> alleles more highly than srg <dig> alleles under sufficient n condition . in the roots, the enriched go terms were quite different from the ones in the shoots although the cellular n compound metabolic process  was enriched in the hybrid when the allele from either srg <dig> or srg <dig> was more highly expressed under sufficient n condition, but only enriched in the hybrid when srg <dig> alleles were more highly expressed than srg <dig> alleles under low n condition, which was similar in the shoots .

discussion
transcriptome changes under n limitation for the three genotypes shows different mechanisms to deal with n limitation
efforts have been directed to understand the mechanisms of how plants respond to n limitation. many approaches have been used, and one of these is transcriptome profiling  <cit> . microarray technology has been used in the past for analyzing genome-scale gene expression  <cit> . extensive studies have been performed for arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . there have also been studies for various crops such as rice seedlings at an early stage of low n stress  <cit>  and the model legume medicago truncatula <cit> . recently, yang et al.  <cit>  utilized multiple whole-genome microarray experiments to identify gene expression biomarkers in maize, which can be used to monitor nitrogen status. the microarray technology, however, has a few intrinsic limitations. the dynamic range of microarrays is restricted by factors such as the probe density/availability and the intensities of fluorescent dyes, as well as reduced sensitivity by non-specific cross-hybridization which can mask isoform expression and inflate the expression of rare transcripts  <cit> . one significant advantage of sequence-based transcriptomics is the potential to precisely quantify the abundance of any transcript, drastically increasing the dynamic range of the experiment  <cit> . considering the advantages, we did a survey of the maize transcriptome using the mrna-seq technique for two parental inbred lines and the corresponding hybrid line, for which a number of phenotypic, molecular, and metabolic factors were previously studied under sufficient and limiting n conditions  <cit> .

from our results, it is evident that the dynamic changes in the transcriptome for the three genotypes reflect the differences in their response to growth under limiting n. between the two parents, srg <dig> demonstrated a better strategy to deal with n limitation, and the hybrid was superior to the parents  <cit> . from the de genes identified and the go terms enriched, the different responses are noticeable among the three genotypes . in leaf tissues, the hybrid shows an enhancement in the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, the cellular amino acid metabolic process, and transport when the plants were under n stress, and these changes were not seen in the parental lines. although the hybrid showed a reduction in the cellular carbohydrate metabolic process under n limitation, the genes involved in photosynthesis were not over-represented in the down-regulated gene list, which was different from the srg <dig> parental line, suggesting that the photosynthesis rate was not down-regulated as much in the hybrid as in the srg <dig> parental line . as c and n metabolism are closely linked and tightly regulated  <cit> , maintaining an adequate photosynthetic rate would certainly favor an efficient production of reduced c and the subsequent efficient use of n. this result correlates well with our physiological tests in a previous study where srg <dig> and srg <dig> maintained higher sugar content in leaves than srg <dig>  <cit> . in root tissues, both the hybrid and the srg <dig> parent significantly increased transport activity, which was not seen in the srg <dig> parental line, and the down-regulation of gene expression associated with primary metabolism was very significant in the hybrid . it has been well documented that root/shoot ratios would increase when plants are grown under n-limiting conditions  <cit>  and that there is an interaction between nitrogen and cytokinin  <cit> . interestingly, the cytokinin degradation pathway was up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots under n limitation only in the hybrid . less reduction of root biomass in the hybrid under n limitation was observed from our previous study  <cit> , and the down-regulation of the cytokinin degradation in the hybrid roots under n limitation might be one of the mechanisms for the hybrid to adapt to n limitation. the limited expression data from our previous study suggested that the three genotypes had different mechanism to cope with n stress  <cit> . the present transcriptome data supports that former observation as the three genotypes presented a different enriched gene set when they had to deal with n stress.

the change in gene expression in the hybrid resembles one parent with a similar nue trait under n limitation
from our previous study, we learned that the parental line srg <dig> had higher nue than srg <dig> and that heterosis was observed in the hybrid srg <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we found that there was a dynamic reprogramming of the transcriptome and the hybrid gene expression levels were significantly more similar to srg <dig> levels than srg <dig> levels when the hybrid plants were experiencing n limitation . this result demonstrated that the transcriptomic similarity mimicked phenotypic similarity.

one possible explanation for the similarity in changes between gene expression levels of one of the parents, srg <dig>  and the hybrid would be that some alleles derived from that parent control expression of other genes in the hybrid, particularly under the n limiting condition. across all genes srg <dig> alleles were slightly more likely to be up-regulated than srg <dig> alleles but the difference was not statistically significant. expression level is determined by a combination of cis-acting and trans-acting regulatory sequences. changes in the expression of the latter, which might be allele specific, would lead to changes in expression of a variety of the regulated genes in a non-allele specific manner. further investigation is needed to understand how plants sense n limitation and change the inventories of the expression of allele-specific genes and how this correlates with the nue trait in different genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression under n limitation in two parental inbreds and the corresponding hybrid line that responded differently to n limitation was surveyed using the mrna-seq technology. the data showed that the three genotypes have different mechanisms to deal with n-limiting conditions. gene expression levels are correlated with the ability of a particular line to respond to growth under limiting n. there was allele-specific expression in the hybrid with a slight bias to the parent that grew better under limiting n. this study enhances our current understanding of the response to growth under n limitation, and the results of this type of study can be used to develop plants with improved nue.
