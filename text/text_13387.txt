BACKGROUND
geobacter metallireducens is a member of the geobacteraceae, a family of fe-respiring delta-proteobacteria that are of interest for their role in cycling of carbon and metals in aquatic sediments and subsurface environments as well as the bioremediation of organic- and metal-contaminated groundwater and the harvesting of electricity from complex organic matter  <cit> . g. metallireducens is of particular interest because it was the first microorganism found to be capable of a number of novel anaerobic processes including:  conservation of energy to support growth from the oxidation of organic compounds coupled to the reduction of fe or mn  <cit> ;  conversion of fe oxide to ultrafine-grained magnetite  <cit> ;  anaerobic oxidation of an aromatic hydrocarbon  <cit> ;  reduction of u  <cit> ;  use of humic substances as an electron acceptor  <cit> ;  chemotaxis toward metals  <cit> ;  complete oxidation of organic compounds to carbon dioxide with an electrode serving as the sole electron acceptor  use of a poised electrode as a direct electron donor  <cit> . although the complete genome sequence of the closely related geobacter sulfurreducens is available  <cit>  and can provide insights into some of the common metabolic features of geobacter species, g. metallireducens and g. sulfurreducens are significantly different in many aspects of their physiology. g. sulfurreducens is known to use only four carbon sources: acetate, formate, lactate  and pyruvate , whereas g. metallireducens uses acetate, benzaldehyde, benzoate, benzylalcohol, butanol, butyrate, p-cresol, ethanol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydroxybenzylalcohol, isobutyrate, isovalerate, phenol, propionate, propanol, pyruvate, toluene and valerate  <cit> .

therefore, in order to gain broader insight into the physiological diversity of geobacter species, the genome of g. metallireducens was sequenced and compared to that of geobacter sulfurreducens  <cit> . both genome annotations were manually curated with the addition, removal and adjustment of hundreds of protein-coding genes and other features. phylogenetic analyses were conducted to validate the findings, including homologs from the finished and unfinished genome sequences of more distantly related geobacteraceae. this paper presents insights into the conserved and unique features of two geobacter species, particularly the metabolic versatility of g. metallireducens and the numerous families of multicopy nucleotide sequences in its genome, which suggest that regulation of gene expression is very different in these two species.

RESULTS
contents of the two genomes
the automated annotation of the g. metallireducens genome identified  <dig> protein-coding genes on the chromosome of  <dig> bp and  <dig> genes on the plasmid  of  <dig> bp. manual curation added  <dig> protein-coding genes plus  <dig> pseudogenes to the chromosome and  <dig> genes to the plasmid. ten of the chromosomal genes were reannotated as pseudogenes and another  <dig> were removed from the annotation. in addition to the  <dig> rna-coding genes in the automated annotation, manual curation identified  <dig> conserved nucleotide sequence features. likewise, to the  <dig> protein-coding genes in the automated annotation of the g. sulfurreducens genome  <cit> , manual curation added  <dig> protein-coding genes and  <dig> pseudogenes. five genes were reannotated as pseudogenes and  <dig> genes were removed from the annotation. in addition to the  <dig> rna-coding genes in the automated annotation, manual curation identified  <dig> conserved nucleotide sequence features. of the  <dig> protein-coding genes and pseudogenes in g. metallireducens,  <dig>  had one or more full-length homologs in g. sulfurreducens.

the nucleotide composition of the  <dig> intact protein-coding genes of g. metallireducens was determined in order to identify some of those that were very recently acquired. the average g+c content of the protein-coding genes was  <dig> %, with a standard deviation of  <dig> %. only three genes had a g+c content more than two standard deviations above the mean , but  <dig> genes had a g+c content more than two standard deviations below the mean , most of which lack homologs in g. sulfurreducens and may be recent acquisitions . clusters of such genes  were often interrupted or flanked by transposons with higher g+c content. the functions of most of these genes cannot be assigned at present, but  <dig> of them are predicted to act in cell wall biogenesis.

plasmid pmet <dig> of g. metallireducens consists of a series of six predicted transcriptional units on one strand, tentatively attributed to the mobilization , entry exclusion , addiction , partition , transposition , and replication  functions of the plasmid, and one operon on the opposite strand, comprised of three genes of unknown function . the predicted origin of replication, located 3' of the repa gene , includes four pairs of iterons and a set of six hairpins, suggesting that pmet <dig> replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism, although it is significantly larger than most such plasmids  <cit> . among the fifteen other nucleotide sequence features identified on the plasmid during manual curation was a palindromic putative autoregulatory site  located 5' of the addiction module. other than the potential toxicity of the addiction module, the impact of pmet <dig> on the physiology of g. metallireducens is unknown.

metabolism of acetate and other carbon sources
acetate is expected to be the key electron donor supporting fe reduction in aquatic sediments and subsurface environments  <cit> , and geobacter species quickly become the predominant bacterial species when acetate is injected into subsurface environments to promote in situ bioremedation of uranium-contaminated groundwater  <cit> . surprisingly, the initial activation of acetate by ligation with coenzyme a  in g. sulfurreducens occurs by two reversible pathways  <cit>  , indicating that acetate may be inefficiently utilized at low concentrations. these two pathways are also present in g. metallireducens, along with a third, irreversible reaction that may permit efficient activation of acetate at low concentrations. the first pathway of acetate activation  occurs through either of two succinyl:acetate coa-transferases that can convert succinyl-coa to succinate during oxidation of acetate by the tricarboxylic acid  cycle pathway, in the same capacity as succinyl-coa synthetase but conserving energy in the form of acetyl-coa rather than gtp or atp  <cit> . microarray data from both species suggest that expression of one succinyl:acetate coa-transferase isoenzyme  is constant and expression of the other  is induced during acetate-fueled growth with electron acceptors other than soluble fe, such as fe oxides, nitrate, or fumarate . the second pathway  consists of two steps: acetate kinase  converts acetate to acetyl-phosphate, which may be a global intracellular signal affecting various phosphorylation-dependent signalling systems, as in escherichia coli  <cit> ; and phosphotransacetylase  converts acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-coa  <cit> . g. metallireducens possesses orthologs of the enzymes of both pathways characterized in g. sulfurreducens  <cit> , and also has an acetyl-coa synthetase  for irreversible activation of acetate to acetyl-coa at the expense of two atp . thus, geobacteraceae such as g. metallireducens may be better suited to metabolize acetate at the low concentrations naturally found in most soils and sediments.

three enzymes distantly related to the succinyl:acetate coa-transferases are encoded by gmet_ <dig>  gmet_ <dig>  and gmet_ <dig>  for which there are no counterparts in g. sulfurreducens. all three of these proteins closely match the characterized butyryl:4-hydroxybutyrate/vinylacetate coa-transferases of clostridium species  <cit> . however, their substrate specificities may be different because the g. metallireducens proteins and the clostridium proteins cluster phylogenetically with different coa-transferases of geobacter strain frc- <dig> and geobacter bemidjiensis . the presence of these coa-transferases indicates that g. metallireducens has evolved energy-efficient activation steps for some unidentified organic acid substrates that g. sulfurreducens cannot utilize.

numerous other enzymes of acyl-coa metabolism are predicted from the genome of g. metalllireducens but not that of g. sulfurreducens , including six gene clusters, three of which have been linked to degradation of aromatic compounds that g. metallireducens can utilize  <cit>  but g. sulfurreducens cannot  <cit> . all seven acyl-coa synthetases of g. sulfurreducens have orthologs in g. metallireducens, but the latter also possesses acetyl-coa synthetase, benzoate coa-ligase , and seven other acyl-coa synthetases of unknown substrate specificity. the g. metallireducens genome also includes eleven acyl-coa dehydrogenases, three of which are specific for benzylsuccinyl-coa , glutaryl-coa  and isovaleryl-coa , whereas none can be identified in g. sulfurreducens. g. metallireducens also has nine pairs of electron transfer flavoprotein genes  that are hypothesized to connect acyl-coa dehydrogenases to the respiratory chain, whereas g. sulfurreducens has only one. none of the seventeen enoyl-coa hydratases of g. metallireducens is an ortholog of gsu <dig>  the sole enoyl-coa hydratase of g. sulfurreducens. g. metallireducens also possesses eleven acyl-coa thioesterases, of which g. sulfurreducens has orthologs of five plus the unique thioesterase gsu <dig>  of the ten acyl-coa thiolases of g. metallireducens, only gmet_ <dig> has an ortholog  in g. sulfurreducens. blast searches and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that several of these enzymes of acyl-coa metabolism have close relatives in g. bemidjiensis, geobacter frc- <dig>  geobacter lovleyi and geobacter uraniireducens, indicating that their absence from g. sulfurreducens is due to gene loss, and that this apparent metabolic versatility is largely the result of expansion of enzyme families within the genus geobacter . the ability of g. metallireducens and other geobacteraceae to utilize carbon sources that g. sulfurreducens cannot utilize may be due to stepwise breakdown of multicarbon organic acids to simpler compounds by these enzymes.

growth of g. metallireducens on butyrate may be attributed to reversible phosphorylation by either of two butyrate kinases , followed by reversible coa-ligation by phosphotransbutyrylase , a pathway not present in g. sulfurreducens, which cannot grow on butyrate  <cit> . these gene products are 42–50% identical to the enzymes characterized in clostridium beijerinckii and clostridium acetobutylicum  <cit> .

an enzyme very similar to succinyl:acetate coa-transferase is encoded by gmet_ <dig> within the same operon as methylisocitrate lyase , 2-methylcitrate dehydratase , and a citrate synthase-related protein hypothesized to be 2-methylcitrate synthase   <cit>  , all of which are absent in g. sulfurreducens. this arrangement of genes, along with the ability of g. metallireducens to utilize propionate as an electron donor  <cit>  whereas g. sulfurreducens cannot  <cit> , suggests that the gmet_ <dig> protein could be a succinyl:propionate coa-transferase that, together with the other three products of the operon, would convert propionate  and oxaloacetate to pyruvate and succinate . upon oxidation of succinate to oxaloacetate through the tca cycle and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-coa, the pathway would be equivalent to the breakdown of propionate into six electrons, one molecule of carbon dioxide, and acetate, followed by the succinyl:acetate coa-transferase reaction . in a phylogenetic tree, the hypothetical succinyl:propionate coa-transferase gmet_ <dig> and gene geob_ <dig> of geobacter frc- <dig>  which is also capable of growth with propionate as the sole electron donor and carbon source , form a branch adjacent to succinyl:acetate coa-transferases of the genus geobacter . in a similar manner, the hypothetical 2-methylcitrate synthase gmet_ <dig> and gene geob_ <dig> of geobacter frc- <dig> form a branch adjacent to citrate synthases of geobacter species , consistent with the notion that these two enzyme families could have recently evolved new members capable of converting propionate via propionyl-coa to 2-methylcitrate.

gmet_ <dig>  is a homolog of acetate kinase that does not contribute sufficient acetate kinase activity to sustain growth of g. sulfurreducens  <cit>  and has a closer blast hit to propionate kinase of e. coli  than to acetate kinase of e. coli. although it does not cluster phylogenetically with either of the e. coli enzymes, its divergence from acetate kinase  is older than the last common ancestor of the geobacteraceae . this conserved gene product remains to be characterized as a propionate kinase or something else.

the proposed pathway for growth of g. metallireducens on propionate  is contingent upon its experimentally established ability to grow on pyruvate  <cit> . g. sulfurreducens cannot utilize pyruvate as the carbon source unless hydrogen is provided as an electron donor  <cit> . oxidation of acetyl-coa derived from pyruvate in g. sulfurreducens may be prevented by a strict requirement for the succinyl:acetate coa-transferase reaction  to complete the tca cycle in the absence of detectable activity of succinyl-coa synthetase   <cit> . with three sets of succinyl-coa synthetase genes , g. metallireducens may produce enough activity to complete the tca cycle.

g. sulfurreducens and g. metallireducens may interconvert malate and pyruvate through a malate oxidoreductase fused to a phosphotransacetylase-like putative regulatory domain , which is 51% identical to the nadp+-dependent malic enzyme of e. coli  <cit> . g. sulfurreducens has an additional malate oxidoreductase without this fusion  that is 53% identical to an nad+-dependent malic enzyme of b. subtilis  <cit> , but g. metallireducens does not.

g. metallireducens possesses orthologous genes for all three pathways that activate pyruvate or oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in g. sulfurreducens : phosphoenolpyruvate synthase , pyruvate phosphate dikinase  and gtp-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gmet_ <dig> = gsu3385)  <cit> . it also encodes a homolog of the atp-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase of e. coli  that has no homolog in g. sulfurreducens. in the catabolic direction, in addition to pyruvate kinase  that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate plus atp, g. metallireducens has a homolog of e. coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  that may convert phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate irreversibly  and contribute to the observed futile cycling of pyruvate/oxaloacetate/phosphoenolpyruvate  <cit>  if not tightly regulated. thus, control of the fate of pyruvate appears to be more complex in g. metallireducens than in g. sulfurreducens.

evidence of recent fumarate respiration in g. metallireducens
the succinate dehydrogenase complex of g. sulfurreducens also functions as a respiratory fumarate reductase, possibly in association with a co-transcribed b-type cytochrome  <cit> . g. metallireducens has homologous genes , but is unable to grow with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor unless transformed with a plasmid that expresses the dicarboxylic acid exchange transporter gene dcub of g. sulfurreducens  <cit> , which has homologues in geobacter frc- <dig>  g. bemidjiensis, g. lovleyi, and g. uraniireducens. surprisingly, g. metallireducens has acquired another putative succinate dehydrogenase or fumarate reductase complex , not found in other geobacteraceae, by lateral gene transfer from a relative of the chlorobiaceae , and evolved it into a gene cluster that includes enzymes of central metabolism acquired from other sources . thus, g. metallireducens may have actually enhanced its ability to respire fumarate before recently losing the requisite transporter.

nitrate respiration and loss of the mode regulon from g. metallireducens
g. metallireducens is able to respire nitrate  <cit> , whereas g. sulfurreducens cannot  <cit> . the nitrate reductase activity of g. metallireducens is attributed to the nargyji genes , which are adjacent to the nark- <dig> and nark- <dig> genes encoding a proton/nitrate symporter and a nitrate/nitrite antiporter  predicted according to homology with the two halves of nark in paracoccus pantotrophus  <cit> . a second nargyi cluster  is missing a noncatalytic subunit , and its expression has not been detected . the first gene of both operons encodes a unique diheme c-type cytochrome , suggesting that the nitrate reductase may be connected to other electron transfer components besides the menaquinol pool, perhaps operating in reverse as a nitrite oxidase. the product of the ppcf gene  in the intact nar operon, which is related to a periplasmic triheme c-type cytochrome involved in fe reduction in g. sulfurreducens  <cit> , may permit electron transfer to the nitrate reductase from extracellular electron donors such as humic substances  <cit>  or graphite electrodes  <cit> . the final two genes of the intact nar operon , encode the moea and moaa enzymes implicated in biosynthesis of bis--molybdenum, an essential cofactor of the nitrate reductase.

phylogenetic analysis indicates that the moea and moaa gene families have repeatedly expanded in various geobacteraceae . g. sulfurreducens has a single copy of each, but g. metallireducens has three closely related isoenzymes, of which moea- <dig>  and moaa- <dig>  occupy a conserved location among other genes of molybdopterin biosynthesis . a possible reason for the expansion in g. metallireducens and other geobacteraceae is a need to upregulate molybdopterin biosynthesis for specific processes: moea- <dig> and moaa- <dig>  may support nitrate reduction; moaa- <dig>  may function with nearby gene clusters for catabolism of benzoate  <cit>  and p-cresol  <cit> ; and moea- <dig>  may aid growth on benzoate, during which it is upregulated  <cit> . g. metallireducens differs from g. sulfurreducens in other aspects of molybdenum assimilation as well : notably, g. sulfurreducens possesses a homolog of the moae gene  encoding the large subunit of molybdopterin synthase, but lacks homologs of the small subunit gene moad and the molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase gene moeb, whereas g. metallireducens lacks a moae homolog but possesses homologs of moad  and moeb . comparison with the genomes of other geobacteraceae suggests that these differences are due to loss of ancestral genes. how the nitrate reductase of g. metallireducens can function with the molybdopterin synthase complex being apparently incomplete is unknown.

1gmet_ <dig> is missing the n-terminal mode domain but retains the c-terminal molybdopterin-binding mopi domains.

in g. sulfurreducens, putative binding sites for the molybdate-sensing mode protein  have been identified by the scanace software  <cit>  in several locations, and the existence of a mode regulon has been predicted  <cit> . the genes in the predicted mode regulon  include one of the two succinyl:acetate coa-transferases, a glycine-specific trna , several transport systems, and some nucleases. in g. metallireducens, there is no full-length mode gene, but a gene encoding the c-terminal molybdopterin-binding  domain of mode  is present in the same location . phylogenetic analysis shows that the gmet_ <dig> gene product is the closest known relative of g. sulfurreducens mode, and that it has evolved out of the geobacteraceae/chlorobiaceae cluster of full-length mode proteins by loss of the n-terminal mode-specific domain . the scanace software detected only one of the mode-binding sites of g. sulfurreducens at the corresponding location in the g. metallireducens genome, but some vestigial sites were apparent when other syntenous locations were visually inspected , indicating that the mode regulon once existed in g. metallireducens, but recent loss of the mode n-terminal domain is allowing the regulatory sites to disappear gradually over the course of genome sequence evolution due to the absence of selective pressure for these sites to remain conserved. thus, genes that may be controlled globally by mode in g. sulfurreducens and other geobacteraceae to optimize molybdenum cofactor-dependent processes have recently acquired independence in g. metallireducens.

amino acid biosynthesis and its regulation
the two genomes differ in several aspects of amino acid biosynthesis and its regulation. to make aspartate from oxaloacetate, a homolog of bacillus circulans aspartate aminotransferase  <cit>  is present in g. metallireducens , whereas a homolog of the sinorhizobium meliloti enzyme  <cit>  is found in g. sulfurreducens . both species possess asparagine synthetase  and glutamine synthetase , as well as an aspartyl/glutamyl-trna amidotransferase operon  that includes glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase . the g. sulfurreducens glne gene may be inactive due to a deletion of ~  <dig> codons in the c-terminal domain.

for biosynthesis of lysine, threonine and methionine, g. metallireducens and other geobacteraceae possess a linked pair of aspartate-4-semialdehyde dehydrogenase genes: pseudomonas aeruginosa-type gmet_ <dig>   <cit>  and mycobacterium bovis-type gmet_ <dig>   <cit> , but g. sulfurreducens has only the former . a haloacid dehalogenase family protein  encoded between two genes of the threonine biosynthesis pathway could be the enzyme required to complete the pathway, a phosphoserine:homoserine phosphotransferase analogous to that of p. aeruginosa  <cit> , and may overlap functionally with the unidentified phosphoserine phosphatase required to complete the biosynthetic pathway of serine.

conserved nucleotide sequences  were identified on the 5' sides of several biosynthetic operons . the lysine biosynthesis operon in g. sulfurreducens and other geobacteraceae begins with a p. aeruginosa-type meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase   <cit> , whereas g. metallireducens has two isoenzymes in other locations . the recently identified l,l-diaminopimelate aminotransferase   <cit>  is co-transcribed with the dapab genes encoding the two preceding enzymes of lysine biosynthesis, but separated from them by a predicted short rna element , also found in  <dig> other locations on the g. metallireducens chromosome .

1the sequence 5' of metc- <dig>  metc- <dig>  and metx is a sam-responsive riboswitch.

2the sequence 5' of leua is a t-box, an rna structure that recognizes the aminoacylation state of trna.

3the sequence 5' of thiamin biosynthesis operons is a thiamin diphosphate-responsive riboswitch.

s-adenosylmethionine -responsive riboswitches  may regulate homoserine o-acetyltransferase , the first dedicated enzyme of methionine biosynthesis, and also two linked cystathionine-γ-synthase/cystathionine-β-lyase genes . phylogenetic analysis could not distinguish the synthase from the lyase , but their presence suggests that homocysteine can be made by transsulfuration of homoserine with cysteine, and not only by the putative o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases . in g. metallireducens, transsulfuration may also be controlled by a gc-rich element between gmet_ <dig> and gmet_ <dig>  which contains four tandem repeats of the heptanucleotide gggaccg and is found in  <dig> intergenic and intragenic locations in the genome .

the leucine pathway-specific leua gene  may be controlled by feedback inhibition through a t-box  <cit>  predicted to form an antiterminator structure in response to uncharged leucine-specific trna having the gag anticodon  , putatively the only trna capable of recognizing 55% of leucine codons in g. metallireducens and 48% in g. sulfurreducens .

there are three 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate  synthase isoenzymes to catalyze the first step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis: one similar to arof of e. coli  and two thermotoga maritima-type enzymes . as one chorismate mutase is fused to prephenate dehydratase , the other  may function predominantly in tyrosine biosynthesis, possibly regulated by the adjacent gene product  that resembles the phenylalanine/tyrosine-responsive domain of t. maritima dahp synthase  <cit> . gmet_ <dig> orthologs phylogenetically cluster with the regulatory domains of gmet_ <dig> orthologs , suggesting that gmet_ <dig> may be a tyrosine-inhibited dahp synthase and gmet_ <dig> may be inhibited by another end product such as phenylalanine. a predicted short rna element , found 5' of gmet_ <dig> and its orthologs in several geobacteraceae, may participate in regulation of this isoenzyme's expression.

in all non-geobacteraceae that possess an indole-scavenging tryptophan synthase β <dig> protein, it is encoded apart from the trp operon containing the trpab <dig> genes for the α  and β <dig>  subunits of tryptophan synthase  <cit> . in g. metallireducens and g. sulfurreducens, however, the β <dig> gene trpb <dig>  is the penultimate gene of the predicted trp operon and the trpb <dig>  and trpa  genes are separated from the 3' end of the operon and from each other by three or more intervening genes, most of which are not conserved between the two genomes . next to the trpb <dig> gene of g. metallireducens is one of  <dig> pairs of a conserved nucleotide motif  hypothesized to bind an unidentified global regulator protein. other, evolutionarily related paired sites where another unidentified global regulator may bind  are found in  <dig> locations. between the proba genes of g. metallireducens, encoding the first two enzymes of proline biosynthesis , is one of eight pairs of predicted binding sites for yet another unidentified global regulator . in g. sulfurreducens, the space between proba is occupied by a different conserved nucleotide sequence , found only in four other places in the same genome. overall, a comparison of the two genomes offers insight into unique features of amino acid biosynthesis and its regulation that deserve further study.

nucleotide metabolism
differences in nucleotide metabolism were identified in the two genomes. g. metallireducens has acquired a possibly redundant large subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase  in addition to the ancestral gene , both genomes encode a second putative thymidylate kinase  distantly related to all others, in addition to the one found in other geobacteraceae . g. sulfurreducens has evidently lost the purt gene product of g. metallireducens and several other geobacteraceae , which incorporates formate directly into purine nucleotides instead of using the folate-dependent purn gene product .

carbohydrate metabolism
comparative genomics indicates that, similar to most geobacter species, g. metallireducens possesses two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes: gmet_ <dig> and gmet_ <dig> , but g. sulfurreducens has an ortholog of only the latter . g. metallireducens also has a putative fructose 6-kinase  that is not present in g. sulfurreducens. remarkably, g. metallireducens possesses two isoenzymes each of udp-glucose 4-epimerase , glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase , gdp-mannose  <dig> -dehydratase  and udp-n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase . g. metallireducens has evolved a gene cluster of the four enzyme activities  from both ancestral gene duplication and lateral gene transfer . the reason for this emphasis on interconversion of hexoses in g. metallireducens versus g. sulfurreducens is unknown.

unlike the genomes of g. sulfurreducens and most other geobacteraceae, which encode the enzymes of only the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, the g. metallireducens genome includes a cluster of oxidative pentose phosphate pathway enzyme genes: 6-phosphogluconolactonase , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , along with two ribose-5-phosphate isomerase isoenzymes . thus, g. metallireducens apparently generates biosynthetic reducing equivalents in the form of nadph from carbohydrates. the nadph supply of g. sulfurreducens, in contrast, may derive from the electron transfer chain via a ferredoxin:nadp+ reductase  that is found in other geobacteraceae, but not in g. metallireducens.

both g. sulfurreducens and g. metallireducens may protect themselves from desiccation by making trehalose from glucose storage polymers via maltooligose in three steps catalyzed by an alpha-amylase domain protein , maltooligosyltrehalose synthase , and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase . g. sulfurreducens, p. propionicus and g. lovleyi may also make trehalose from glucose-6-phosphate by the sequential action of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  and trehalose-6-phosphatase , which are missing in g. metallireducens. thus, g. sulfurreducens is capable of achieving osmotolerance without consuming carbohydrate storage polymers, but g. metallireducens is not.

biogenesis of c-type cytochromes and pili
the genome of g. metallireducens encodes  <dig> putative c-type cytochromes, of which  <dig> have homologs among the  <dig> c-type cytochromes of g. sulfurreducens. of the c-type cytochrome genes implicated in fe and u reduction in g. sulfurreducens, those conserved in g. metallireducens are maca   <cit>  and ppca   <cit> , whereas different c-type cytochrome sequences are found in syntenous locations where one would expect omcb and omcc   <cit> , and omce   <cit> . the g. metallireducens genome contains no genes homologous to omcs  and omct   <cit> , and only a paralog  of omcf   <cit> . this lack of conservation is being investigated further .

notable differences between g. metallireducens and g. sulfurreducens are apparent in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes, in biosynthesis of the heme group, and in reduction of disulfide bonds to allow covalent linkage to heme. in addition to the membrane-peripheral protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase of g. sulfurreducens and other geobacteraceae, encoded by the hemy gene , g. metallireducens has a membrane-integral isoenzyme encoded by hemg , with a homolog in geobacter frc- <dig>  these two species also possess a putative disulfide bond reduction system not found in g. sulfurreducens and other geobacteraceae, comprised of dsba, dsbb, dsbe and dsbd homologs , encoded in a cluster alongside a two-component signalling system , an arylsulfotransferase , and a conserved protein of unknown function . transcription of dsba and dsbb is diminished during growth on benzoate  <cit> , and phylogenetic analysis indicates that these dsba and dsbb proteins belong to subfamilies distinct from those that have been characterized . located apart from this cluster, dsbc/dsbg  of g. metallireducens has homologs in several geobacteraceae, but not in g. sulfurreducens. however, ccda/dsbd  is present in both. thus, the pathways of c-type cytochrome biogenesis may be significantly different in the two species and somehow linked to the degradation of aromatic compounds by g. metallireducens.

in both g. sulfurreducens and g. metallireducens, there are four c-type cytochrome biogenesis genes related to resb of b. subtilis  <cit> , each predicted to be co-transcribed with a gene encoding a resc/hemx-like protein   <cit>  and several multiheme c-type cytochrome genes . one more protein of the resc/hemx-like family  is encoded among enzymes of heme biosynthesis in both genomes. these gene arrangements suggest that each pair of c-type cytochrome biogenesis proteins may be dedicated to the efficient expression of the cytochromes encoded nearby. two of the pairs are orthologously conserved ; the other two pairs , which appear to derive from expansion of ancestral genes, may be relevant to the diversified c-type cytochrome repertoire of the two species. interestingly, three of these gene pairs in g. metallireducens are arranged in proximity to each other in a cluster of ten operons with the same coding dna strand , suggesting that their expression may be co-ordinated by transcriptional readthrough . the purposes of various pairs of c-type cytochrome biogenesis proteins in geobacteraceae remain to be determined.

the pili of g. sulfurreducens have been implicated in electron transfer  <cit>  and biofilm formation  <cit> . most genes attributed to pilus biogenesis in g. sulfurreducens have orthologs in g. metallireducens, suggesting that these roles of pili may be conserved. however, instead of the ancestral pily <dig> gene found in g. sulfurreducens  and other geobacteraceae, which may encode a pilus tip-associated adhesive protein  <cit> , g. metallireducens possesses a phylogenetically distinct pily <dig> gene in the same location , surrounded by different genes of unknown function within a cluster of pilus biogenesis genes. therefore, it remains possible that structural and functional differences between the pili of the two species will be identified in future.

solute transport systems
although the substrates of most solute transport systems of g. metallireducens and g. sulfurreducens are unknown, several features distinguish the two species . one of two predicted gtp-dependent fe transporters of the geobacteraceae , located next to the ferric uptake regulator gene , is present in g. metallireducens; the other , with two feoa genes on its 5' side  potentially encoding an essential cytosolic component of the transport system  <cit> , is not. phylogenetic analysis showed that the feob- <dig> proteins of geobacteraceae are closely related to the characterized fe-specific feob proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis  <cit>  and campylobacter jejuni  <cit> , whereas the feob- <dig> proteins of geobacteraceae cluster apart from them . feob- <dig> proteins are not closely related to the manganese-specific feob of p. gingivalis  <cit>  either, and so their substrate specificity cannot be assigned at present.

in g. metallireducens, duplicate kup genes, predicted to encode low-affinity potassium/proton symporters, are found in one place , apart from the kdpabcde genes  encoding an osmosensitive potassium-translocating atpase complex. in g. sulfurreducens, one of these kup genes  is located 3' of the kdp gene cluster, apparently under control of an osmosensitive riboswitch , and there is a third kup gene  not found in other geobacteraceae. g. sulfurreducens also has at least two potassium/proton antiporters  and a sodium/proton antiporter complex  that are not found in g. metallireducens. three mechanosensitive ion channels are common to the two species ; two more are unique to g. sulfurreducens . thus, control of monovalent cation homeostasis appears to be more complex in g. sulfurreducens.

several heavy metal efflux pumps are conserved between the two species, but their substrate specificity is uncertain. transporters present in g. sulfurreducens but not g. metallireducens include that for uracil . transporters present in g. metallireducens but not g. sulfurreducens include those for nitrate/nitrite  and chromate , which are each present as two paralogous genes rather than gene fusions such as their homologs that have been characterized in other bacteria  <cit> .

signalling, chemotaxis and global regulation
g. metallireducens possesses orthologs of the six sigma factors of rna polymerase identified in g. sulfurreducens , as well as a seventh factor  not found in other geobacteraceae, related to the extracytoplasmic sigma-z factor of b. subtilis  <cit> . intriguingly, a particular anti-anti-sigma factor gene is frameshifted in both genomes: gsu <dig> has frameshifts in the phosphatase domain, resulting in an in-frame protein, whereas the homologous gmet_ <dig> is shifted out of frame in the kinase domain. these differences imply that global regulatory networks may be different in the two species.

the g. metallireducens genome encodes  <dig> putative sensor histidine kinases containing hatpase_c domains , of which  <dig>  have orthologs among the  <dig> such proteins of g. sulfurreducens. there are  <dig> proteins with response receiver  domains in g. metallireducens , out of which  <dig>  have orthologs among the  <dig> such proteins of g. sulfurreducens. twenty-seven of the rec domain-containing proteins and another  <dig> genes and four pseudogenes  were predicted to be transcriptional regulators in g. metallireducens. there are  <dig> putative diguanylate cyclases containing ggdef domains, of which  <dig>  have orthologs among the  <dig> putative diguanylate cyclases of g. sulfurreducens . overall, the portion of the genome dedicated to signalling and transcriptional regulation in g. metallireducens is slightly less than in g. sulfurreducens, but still considerable and significantly different in content.

several protein factors involved in chemotaxis-type signalling pathways are conserved between the two genomes: g. sulfurreducens and g. metallireducens each possess four or five chea sensor kinases and ten chey response receivers, almost all of which are orthologous pairs . in contrast,  <dig> of the  <dig> methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins  of g. sulfurreducens have no full-length matches in g. metallireducens . due to apparent gene family expansion in g. sulfurreducens, its remaining  <dig> mcps correspond to only  <dig> mcps of g. metallireducens . the other five mcps of g. metallireducens lack full-length matches in other geobacteraceae . whereas g. sulfurreducens may use its closely related mcps to fine-tune its chemotactic responses, g. metallireducens may accomplish response modulation by having twice as many mcp methyltransferases  and methylesterases  as g. sulfurreducens .

integration host factors  and histone-like  dna-binding proteins are global regulators of gene expression composed of two homologous proteins that bend dna in specific locations  <cit> . ihf/hu binding sites are favoured by some mobile genetic elements for insertion. the genome of g. metallireducens encodes orthologs of the single hu protein, both ihf beta proteins, and one of two ihf alpha proteins of g. sulfurreducens . another hu gene and two additional ihf alpha genes are present in g. metallireducens but not g. sulfurreducens . three sets of putative global regulatory elements unique to the g. metallireducens genome  may be recognized by different combinations of ihf/hu proteins. a fourth set found in g. metallireducens  is similar to multicopy sequences in many other genomes. two transposons  were found inserted near putative ihf/hu-binding sites of class  <dig> . no such putative global regulatory sequence elements were identified in g. sulfurreducens. however, pirin, a fe-binding protein that associates with dna in eukaryotic nuclei  <cit> , is present in g. sulfurreducens as gsu <dig>  but in g. metallireducens only as a frameshifted fragment, gmet_ <dig>  these genetic differences indicate that the proteins that decorate and bend the chromosome are very different in the two species.

*gmet_ <dig> is frameshifted near the n-terminus, but may be expressed from an internal start codon.

the functions and associations of the various ihf alpha , ihf beta , and hu  genes are yet unknown, as is their correspondence to any of the predicted regulatory sites illustrated in figures s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> 

although no quorum sensing through n-acylhomoserine lactones  has ever been demonstrated for any geobacteraceae, this kind of signalling may be possible for g. metallireducens because it possesses a luxr family transcriptional regulator with an autoinducer-binding domain , and two divergently transcribed genes with weak sequence similarity to autoinducer synthetases . both gmet_ <dig> and gmet_ <dig> have atypically low g+c content  and may have been recently acquired by g. metallireducens. the presence of a conserved nucleotide sequence on the 5' side of gmet_ <dig> and in  <dig> other locations on the chromosome  suggests that gmet_ <dig> may be an unusual autoinducer synthetase that is regulated by a riboswitch rather than an autoinducer-binding protein. this conserved sequence is also found on the 5' side of many genes  in the genomes of g. sulfurreducens, g. uraniireducens, and p. propionicus, and overlaps with predicted cyclic diguanylate-responsive riboswitches  <cit> .

the genomes of g. metallireducens and g. sulfurreducens differ in several other aspects of regulation. nine pairs of potential toxins and antitoxins were identified in the g. metallireducens genome , which may poison vital cellular processes in response to stimuli that interfere with their autoregulation. only one of these was similar to one of the five potential toxin/antitoxin pairs of g. sulfurreducens. both the crispr <dig> and crispr <dig>  loci of g. sulfurreducens, thought to encode  <dig> short rnas that may provide immunity against infection by unidentified phage and plasmids  <cit> , have no parallel in g. metallireducens, which has crispr <dig>  instead, encoding only twelve putative short rnas of more variable length and unknown target specificity . another difference in rna-level regulation is that a single-stranded rna-specific nuclease of the barnase family  and its putative cognate inhibitor of the barstar family  are present in g. metallireducens but not g. sulfurreducens.

several conserved nucleotide sequences were identified by comparison of intergenic regions between the g. sulfurreducens and g. metallireducens genomes, and those that are found in multiple copies  may give rise to short rnas with various regulatory or catalytic activities.

CONCLUSIONS
inspection of the g. metallireducens genome indicates that this species has many metabolic capabilities not present in g. sulfurreducens, particularly with respect to the metabolism of organic acids. many biosynthetic pathways and regulatory features are conserved, but several putative global regulator-binding sites are unique to g. metallireducens. the complement of signalling proteins is significantly different between the two genomes. thus, the genome of g. metallireducens provides valuable information about conserved and variable aspects of metabolism, physiology and genetics of the geobacteraceae.
