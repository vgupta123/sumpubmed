BACKGROUND
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is a basidiomycete yeast that has been mostly studied for its ability to synthesize xanthophyll astaxanthin as its main carotenoid. astaxanthin  takes third place in the global market for carotenoids, which reached $ <dig> million in the year  <dig> and is expected to exceed $ <dig> million by the year  <dig>  <cit> . this carotenoid is currently used in aquaculture for salmon flesh pigmentation and as a supplement for the diets of farm chickens to produce a stronger yolk and flesh pigmentation  <cit> . additionally, astaxanthin has strong antioxidant properties and has been proposed to play a protective role against oxidative stress in yeast  <cit> . recent findings suggested that astaxanthin supplementation could be beneficial as a treatment for several degenerative diseases in addition to other potential benefits for human health  <cit> . to date, x. dendrorhous is the only known organism that synthesizes astaxanthin from β-carotene through a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme system  <cit> , suggesting that this yeast has developed a unique p <dig> system specialized for the production of this carotenoid.

cytochrome p <dig> proteins  represent a large superfamily of heme-containing monooxygenases that are distributed throughout three domains of life  <cit>  and play significant roles in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of exogenous and endogenous substrates  <cit> . cyp enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of many physiologically important compounds, such as sterols, steroid hormones, fatty acids and vitamins  <cit> , and a vast array of secondary metabolites in plants, insects and fungi  <cit> . additionally, these enzymes are the main catalysts involved in the activation and detoxification of different xenobiotics, such as drugs, pesticides, carcinogens and environmentally contaminating chemicals  <cit> . cyp enzymes require the reducing equivalents from nadph or nadh, which are generally transferred to cyps through a redox partner to catalyze the general reaction rh + o2 + 2e− + 2h+ → roh + h2o  <cit> .

only two cyp enzymes have been described in x. dendrorhous: the astaxanthin synthase that is involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis and cyp <dig>  which participates in ergosterol biosynthesis  <cit> . considering the biological relevance of this protein family and the involvement of a unique system in x. dendrorhous, in this work we describe a third cyp in this yeast: cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> is one of the first modifying enzymes involved in sterol synthesis. it catalyzes the c <dig> demethylation of lanosterol in yeasts during ergosterol biosynthesis and is considered to be an ancestral cyp from which other cyps evolved  <cit> .

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> gene
using bioinformatic analyses of the genomic and transcriptomic data of x. dendrorhous available in our laboratory with the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> gene as a query , we identified a putative x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> gene. this gene was uploaded into the genbank database . the primers cyp <dig> up.f and cyp51dw.r were designed based on this gene sequence and used to amplify genomic dna from strain ucd 67– <dig>  the obtained pcr-product of approximately  <dig>  bp was inserted into the ecorv site of the pbluescript sk- plasmid, generating plasmid pbs-gcyp <dig>  similarly, the cdna version  of the cyp <dig> gene was obtained by rt-pcr from x. dendrorhous total rna using the primer set ccyp <dig> f + ccyp <dig> r. this cdna was ligated into the ecorv site of the pbluescript sk- plasmid to generate plasmid pbs-ccyp <dig>  the sequences of the genomic and cdna versions were determined in both strands and compared, revealing that the cyp <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous consists of  <dig> exons of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 408 bp and  <dig> introns of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 90 bp. the cyp <dig> gene was predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein with an expected molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and pi of  <dig> . this protein shares 48% identity and 65% similarity at 91% coverage with the s. cerevisiae c14-demethylase  , which belongs to the cytochrome p <dig> protein family and is involved in the third step of ergosterol biosynthesis from squalene: the conversion of lanosterol to  <dig> -dimethylcholesta- <dig> ,24-trienol  <cit> .figure  <dig> sequence alignment between x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> and s. cerevisiae erg <dig> proteins and prediction of structurally conserved motifs in cyp <dig>  amino acid alignment between the deduced cyp <dig> sequence from x. dendrorhous  strain ucd 67– <dig> and the s. cerevisiae  strain s288c erg <dig>  protein . amino acid differences with the same properties are denoted with a plus . structural elements are highlighted with the name of the corresponding feature above them: possible transmembrane helix , alpha helices , beta-sheets , meander loop and cys pocket . the asterisks  indicate the three totally conserved amino acids among cytochromes p <dig>  secondary structural elements were predicted with the cyp <dig> engineering database  <cit> , and the potential transmembrane region was predicted with tmpred  <cit> .



amino acid sequences are highly diverse among the cytochrome p <dig> protein family; however, their structural fold is highly conserved  <cit> . in the deduced cyp <dig> protein from x. dendrorhous, several cytochrome p <dig> secondary structural elements were predicted using the cyp <dig> engineering database, including alpha helices a, b, c, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, k’ and l, beta-sheets 1– <dig> - <dig>  1– <dig>  3– <dig>  1– <dig>  2– <dig>  2– <dig>  1– <dig>  3– <dig>  4– <dig>  4– <dig> and 3– <dig>  the meander loop involved in the stabilization of the tertiary structure and heme binding, and the cys pocket that contains the conserved cysteine involved in heme binding  <cit>  . identification of p450s across biological kingdoms depends largely on the identification of two p <dig> signature motifs: exxr at the k-helix and fxxgxrxcxg  at the cys-pocket. these motifs contain three totally conserved amino acids: the glutamic acid and arginine of the exxr motif and the cysteine in the cys pocket that serves as a fifth ligand for the heme iron  <cit> . site-directed mutagenesis of these three invariant residues in most cyps results in inactive and misfolded p <dig> isoforms, suggesting their importance in maintaining the p <dig> structure  <cit> . all of these motifs were recognized in the x. dendrorhous deduced cyp <dig> protein, including the three invariant p <dig> residues. a threonine and a leucine were found at the second and third positions of the exxr motif; these are the preferred residues at these positions in p450s, including the cyp <dig> family  <cit> . moreover, the cxg motif of the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> protein  maintains the preferred residues described for the cyp <dig> family  <cit> . this finding is interesting because instead of the conserved arginine at the sixth position of this motif, cyp <dig> contains a histidine surrounded by arginines. additionally, a putative hydrophobic trans-membrane segment at the cyp <dig> amino terminus was predicted. this finding represents an important feature that allows class ii p <dig> enzymes to anchor to the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . these observations strongly suggest that the identified x. dendrorhous gene encodes a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, specifically cyp <dig> with lanosterol demethylase activity.

the deduced x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> protein was modeled  with the homology modeling technique using the swissmodel web server. the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> protein , which shares 48% sequence identity, was used as a template. additionally, possible protein-ligand binding interactions between the cyp <dig> protein model and the potential lanosterol and itraconazole ligands were predicted with the protein docking technique using the autodock <dig> program  <cit>  . according to the results, the azole antifungal fits in a similar way to the substrate lanosterol in a hydrophobic groove and interacts with met- <dig> and the p-methyl group of thr- <dig>  previous studies have also reported these residues as binding sites of azole antifungals in cytochrome p <dig> proteins  <cit> . therefore, the itraconazole azole binds to the cyp <dig> protein in the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme, thus blocking its enzymatic catalysis.figure  <dig> three-dimensional model and docking of the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> deduced protein.  the model was generated by the swissmodel web server  <cit>  using the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> protein with lanosterol as the template ligand .  the autodock <dig> program  <cit>  was used to perform automated docking to predict the binding sites of lanosterol  and itraconazole  in the obtained model of the cyp <dig> protein from x. dendrorhous.



functional analysis of the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> gene
the functionality of the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> gene was evaluated by two different approaches: heterologous complementation in s. cerevisiae and gene mutation in x. dendrorhous.

the heterologous complementation analyses were performed using a diploid s. cerevisiae that is heterologous for the erg <dig> gene , because a null mutant is not viable  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> gene and the cdna of the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> gene were ligated into the s. cerevisiae expression vector yepnp, generating plasmids yepnp-gerg <dig> and yepnp-ccyp51; then, these plasmids were used to transform the sc-erg11+/− strain. several transformants were recovered in each case, and at least three transformants of each type were randomly chosen to confirm that they contained the respective plasmid. given that all of the analyzed transformants showed a positive result in this analysis, one of each  was chosen for sporulation to obtain haploid strains. after 6 days of incubation in sporulation media agar plates, the formation of asci was confirmed by optical microscopy. the asci were broken and seeded onto sd agar plates supplemented with g <dig> to confirm the presence of the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> mutant allele, and with uracil, histidine, lysine and methionine to sustain all possible auxotrophies in the resulting haploid strains. although the haploid cells were enriched by diethyl ether treatment  <cit> , it is also possible to obtain diploid strains among the g418-resistant strains. because of this, haploid strains were first selected according to their auxotrophy for methionine and lysine, both of which are heterozygous markers in the original diploid parental strain. subsequently, the haploid condition of the erg <dig> mutant allele and its complementation of the expression vector were confirmed by pcr analyses using comprehensive sets of primers . after these analyses, a single strain that fulfilled the requirements for heterologous expression studies carrying the yepnp-gerg <dig> or the yepnp-ccyp <dig> vector was chosen; these strains were named sc-herg <dig> and sc-hcyp <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig> pcr-based analyses of s. cerevisiae erg11

the strains sc-herg <dig> and sc-hcyp <dig> did not show significant differences in their growth curves when cultured in ym medium at 22°c with constant agitation . additionally, sterols were extracted after  <dig>   <dig> and 56 h of cultivation . when the sterol compositions were analyzed by rp-hplc, all strains showed the same sterol pattern, with one main sterol produced with 13 min of retention time. this sterol was confirmed to correspond to ergosterol after co-injecting each sample with standard ergosterol. in general, strain sc-hcyp <dig> showed a lower sterol content than strains sc-erg11+/− and sc-herg <dig> at all analyzed time points. however, the fact that strain sc-hcyp <dig> was viable and able to produce ergosterol indicates that the cyp <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous complements the erg <dig> null mutation in s. cerevisiae. therefore, this gene encodes a lanosterol c14-demethylase that is able to couple with the endogenous s. cerevisiae cytochrome p <dig> reductase in vivo.table  <dig>

to evaluate the functionality of cyp <dig> in x. dendrorhous, cyp <dig> mutants were created by replacing the cyp <dig> locus with an antibiotic resistance module through homologous recombination as previously described  <cit> . for this purpose, the wild-type strain cbs  <dig> was chosen because it has been shown to be aneuploid, and hemizygous mutants can be obtained after only one transformation event  <cit> . before transformation, the cyp <dig> gene from strain cbs  <dig> was sequenced, uploaded to the genbank database  and compared to the sequence from strain ucd 67– <dig>  minimal differences were found between these two strains, which possessed  <dig> % identity in the region from the start to the stop translation codons. after cbs  <dig> transformation with linear plasmid pbs-cyp51/hph, a hygromycin b-resistant transformant was obtained. although it was confirmed that the cyp <dig> locus was indeed replaced by the resistance module in this strain, the cyp <dig> gene could still be amplified using a comprehensive set of primers, suggesting that this strain was heterozygous for the cyp <dig> locus. therefore, this strain was named cbs-cyp51+/−. this strain was still a useful model to evaluate the effect of the cyp <dig> mutation in x. dendrorhous; because the deletion of this gene has been shown to be lethal to the cells of other yeast strains, a cyp <dig> null mutant would most likely not be viable  <cit> . interestingly, the mutant strain had a more intense reddish color that was discernable to the naked eye than the wild type strain, suggesting that it produces more carotenoids than the parental strain. to confirm this observation and to evaluate phenotypic variations between these two strains, growth curves were constructed and sterols and carotenoids were extracted and quantified after  <dig> and 120 h of cultivation.

the growth curves of both strains did not show significant differences at the lag and exponential phases of growth; however, strain cbs-cyp51+/− reached a lower od <dig> during the stationary phase of growth  . after 48 h of cultivation, the wild-type strain accumulated approximately 70% more sterols than the mutant strain; however, after 120 h of culture, there were no statistically significant differences between the strains . this outcome may be the result of a regulation mechanism that modulates sterol biosynthesis according to the metabolic state of the yeast, which is reduced during the stationary phase of growth. similarly, previous studies in filamentous fungi and in yeast have reported reduced ergosterol accumulation during the stationary phase of growth  <cit> . moreover, both strains showed the same sterol composition, with ergosterol representing close to 100% of the identified sterols; this result was confirmed by co-injection of the samples with standard ergosterol in rp-hplc analysis. an additional two unidentified sterols could be detected in both strains with retention times of  <dig>  and 15 min; however, these sterols were found in a significantly lower proportion.table  <dig>

the mutant strain contained a higher amount of carotenoids , with an approximately  <dig> -fold increase after 120 h of culture. previous studies on carotenogenesis in x. dendrorhous have shown that this process is induced by the end of the exponential and early stationary phases of growth, coinciding with the point at which glucose is completely exhausted  <cit> . therefore, it is expected that the major differences in carotenoid content can be better appreciated in older cultures. however, the cbs-cyp51+/− strain also had a higher carotenoid content after 48 h of culture, suggesting that carotenogenesis starts earlier in this strain. moreover, carotenoid composition also differed between both strains, with a reduced astaxanthin proportion in the cbs-cyp51+/− strain . interestingly, changes in the carotenoid composition showed similarity to cultures of x. dendrorhous in which the crti gene  was over-expressed  <cit> , resulting in an increased monocyclic carotenoid proportion in cbs-cyp51+/− cells. moreover, β-carotene and xanthophyll intermediaries such as phoenicoxanthin and canthaxathin are increased during the synthesis of astaxanthin from β-carotene in cbs-cyp51+/−, suggesting that the cytochrome p <dig> system involved in these steps may be weakened. it is likely that this change is the consequence of the reduced cyp <dig> gene dose in cbs-cyp51+/−, which could favor the activity of the cytochrome p <dig> systems involved in ergosterol biosynthesis at the expense of astaxanthin synthesis. this idea is supported by the higher cytochrome p <dig> reductase transcript levels found in the cbs-cyp51+/−strain after 24 h of cultivation  that can sustain cytochrome p <dig> activity during ergosterol biosynthesis.

similar to our findings, several studies have observed increased carotenoid production in x. dendrorhous when ergosterol levels are reduced. for example, when phaffia rhodozyma  was cultured in the presence of the antifungal ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor fluconazole, enhanced astaxanthin production was observed  <cit> . one possible explanation is that ergosterol down-regulates its own synthesis via a negative-feedback mechanism. therefore, a reduced ergosterol content favors the availability of mevalonate pathway products, which are common to ergosterol and carotenoid syntheses. this reasoning is supported by a previous study in which x. dendrorhous mutants that are unable to synthesize ergosterol due to the cyp <dig> mutation had increased carotenoid content compared to their parental wild type strains. moreover, transcript levels of at least one gene of the mevalonate pathway  were significantly increased  <cit> . in this sense, the supplementation of mevalonate in p. rhodozyma cultures resulted in an increase in carotenoid production  <cit> . furthermore, deletion of the gene encoding squalene synthase  in combination with the overexpression of the catalytic domain of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coa-reductase in a recombinant candida utilis strain caused an increase in lycopene production  <cit> .

based on this reasoning, we evaluated whether hmgr transcript levels were enhanced in strain cbs-cyp51+/−. to accomplish this, total rna was extracted from the parental and cbs-cyp51+/− strains after  <dig> and 48 h of cultivation in ym media with constant agitation at 22°c, and the transcript levels were analyzed by rt-qpcr. the results revealed that the hmgr transcript level was indeed higher in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain, indicating that the elimination of one allele of the cyp <dig> gene of x. dendrorhous affected the expression of hmgr . the hmgr gene controls one of the key regulatory steps in the mevalonate pathway, and, in turn, carotenoid and ergosterol biosynthesis through substrate availability  <cit> ; therefore, an increase in the hmgr transcript level could partly explain the increased carotenoid content in the mutant strain cbs-cyp51+/−. similar to our findings, there was an increase in carotenoid content that was also related to a higher hmgr transcript levels following the treatment of the fungus blaskelea trispora with ketoconazole, a specific inhibitor of cyp <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig> rt-qpcr analysis of the hmgr, crtr and cyp <dig> genes in the wild-type and cbs-cyp51

 transcript levels were determined by rt-qpcr after  <dig> and 48 h of cultivation of the wild-type and the cbs-cyp51
+/−strains. each transcript level was normalized with respect to the transcript level of the actin gene and then with respect to the wild-type strain: cbs  <dig>  and cbs-cyp51+/− . values are the mean ± standard error of three independent experiments .



because cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are involved in both astaxanthin and ergosterol biosynthesis, we also evaluated the crtr transcript levels  <cit> . crtr encodes for a cytochrome p <dig> reductase, which is the main electron donor in these systems. interestingly, the crtr transcript level was also higher in cbs-cyp51+/− after 24 h of cultivation; however, this difference was not statistically significant after 48 h of growth . although several different genes may encode cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in an organism, usually there is only one gene encoding the enzyme cytochrome p <dig> reductase. consequently, a complex mechanism of regulation of the expression of crtr is required to set the levels of cytochrome p <dig> reductase activity in relation to the various cytochrome p <dig> proteins in this organism. to date, three cytochrome p450-encoding genes have been described in x. dendrorhous: crts  <cit> , cyp <dig>  <cit>  and cyp <dig> ). thus, the cytochrome p <dig> reductase would act as a cytochrome p <dig> redox partner at least in the carotenoid and ergosterol synthesis pathways. finally, we also analyzed whether the elimination of one cyp <dig> allele indeed affected its own transcript levels. after 24 h of cultivation, no significant differences were observed between the mutant and the parental strain; however, after 48 h of cultivation, differences could be appreciated , confirming that the x. dendrorhous mutant generated in this work indeed affected cyp <dig> transcript levels.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the cyp <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous was identified and its function was characterized. this gene encodes a putative protein that contains all of the cytochrome p <dig> conserved motifs and is consistent with cyp <dig> protein family characteristics. the heterologous complementation analysis in s. cerevisiae strongly suggests that this gene in fact encodes a functional sterol c14-demethylase. moreover, a cyp <dig> mutation in x. dendrorhous affected sterol and carotenoid production, supporting the finding that reduced sterol production is related to higher carotenoid production.
