BACKGROUND
muscarinic m <dig> receptors are the predominant muscarinic receptor subtype expressed in the brain with high levels of expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. muscarinic m <dig> receptors are believed to mediate many important central processes such as cognition and memory  <cit>  and thus are targeted for the development of drugs to treat various neurological disorders, such as alzheimer's disease. however, discovery of selective m <dig> agonists has been challenging due to the highly conserved orthosteric acetylcholine binding site of muscarinic receptors. recent structure-function studies have led to the identification of functionally selective muscarinic m <dig> agonists  <cit> . mutagenesis studies have shown that mutations that abolish activation of m <dig> receptors by orthosteric ligands do not affect, and in some cases even enhance, activation by these selective ligands  <cit> . these novel selective ligands have been named allosteric m <dig> agonists because their mode of interaction with m <dig> receptor is different from that of orthosteric agonists  <cit> .

while allosteric m <dig> agonists appear to bind to a receptor domain different from that of the orthosteric ligands, in many cases they have been shown to induce similar signaling pathways as the orthosteric m <dig> agonists. moreover, allosteric m <dig> agonists can displace conventional orthosteric m <dig> muscarinic radioligands such as -nms  <cit> . based on these data, it has been suggested that there is some degree of overlap between the allosteric and orthosteric binding sites on the m <dig> receptor for these ligands  <cit> .

a recent study  <cit>  has demonstrated that some allosteric muscarinic m <dig> agonists differentially activate downstream signaling pathways for m1receptors, suggesting "stimulus trafficking" with respect to receptor signaling events. however, presently little is known about the potential differences between orthosteric and allosteric muscarinic m <dig> ligands in modulating receptor regulatory pathways such as internalization, down-regulation or recycling. the present study was carried out to assess these cellular regulatory events in muscarinic m <dig> receptors in response to a number of allosteric and orthosteric m <dig> agonists.

in order to understand the mode of interaction of a ligand with the receptor, it is important to characterize receptor-ligand interaction in multiple assays and in multiple systems  <cit>  and also to correlate it with the induction of downstream signaling and regulatory pathways. receptor regulatory events include receptor processes such as desensitization , internalization/endocytosis  and down-regulation .

in the present study, several different assays were employed in order to comprehensively evaluate various intracellular signaling and regulatory processes. the results demonstrate that allosteric ligands differ from orthosteric ligands and amongst each other in induction of internalization, down-regulation, recycling and signaling of m <dig> muscarinic receptors.

a preliminary report of the present work was presented at the meetings for society for neuroscience,  <dig> and at recent advances in muscarinic receptor pharmacology and therapeutics colloquium,  <dig> 

RESULTS
allosteric and orthosteric agonists induce signaling of human muscarinic m <dig> receptors
receptor activation in response to agonist treatment was measured by two different assays, receptor selection and amplification assay  and phosphatidylinositol  hydrolysis assay . these two assays showed similar results for all compounds tested. among the ligands tested, ac- <dig> and ndmc were shown to be partial agonists in both assays, while all the other compounds were able to activate m <dig> receptor with full efficacy as compared to carbachol.

activities of compounds on human m <dig> receptors were compared using two different assay; rsat in transiently transfected nih-3t <dig> cells and pi hydrolysis in stable cho-m <dig> cells. data for each compound is normalized to carbachol for both assays. values presented are mean ± sd from 2- <dig> independent experiments carried out in triplicate.

allosteric m <dig> agonists, ac- <dig> and xanomeline, show distinctive effects on receptor endocytosis
treatment with all the orthosteric and allosteric m <dig> agonists resulted in reduced cell surface binding  as measured with -nms, while having no effect on total receptor binding as measured with -qnb .

to visualize endocytosis of m <dig> receptors from the cell surface into endosomes, translocation of the m <dig> receptors was followed using confocal microscopy. the results demonstrated that treatment with carbachol, pilocarpine, oxotremorine-m, ndmc and ac- <dig> induced translocation of cell surface receptors into intracellular vesicles, while no receptors could be visualized in the endosomes after treatment with ac- <dig> or xanomeline . translocation of m <dig> receptors seen with these ligands was blocked by treatment with the muscarinic antagonist atropine .

the time course of receptor internalization was assessed for some of these compounds. carbachol and ndmc induced translocation of receptors into intracellular vesicles within five minutes of treatment, while ac- <dig> did not induce formation of any vesicles even after  <dig> hours of treatment .

hypertonic sucrose treatment blocks m <dig> receptor internalization
treatment of the hek- <dig> cells with hypertonic sucrose blocked loss of cell surface receptor binding induced by all allosteric and orthosteric m <dig> agonists . these results indicate that the loss of cell surface receptors induced by all these compounds are mediated via a common cellular pathway, namely by formation of clathrin-coated pits.

lack of m <dig> receptor recycling following treatment with allosteric agonists
receptor recycling to the cell surface following removal of the agonists was assessed in hek- <dig> cells transiently transfected with hm <dig>  agonist removal after treatment with carbachol and oxotremorine-m resulted in recovery of cell surface binding as measured by -nms. however, no receptor recycling could be observed following treatment with the allosteric agonists, ac- <dig> and ac- <dig> or after treatment with xanomeline. the extent of recovery of -nms binding following removal of each ligand is summarized in table  <dig> 

hek- <dig> cells expressing hm <dig> were treated with various ligands for  <dig> minutes as indicated in the table. concentrations of ligands used were as follows; carbachol,  <dig> μm; oxotremorine-m,  <dig> μm; xanomeline,  <dig> μm; ac- <dig>   <dig> μm; and ac- <dig>   <dig> μm and similar to concentration used in the internalization assays. values presented are % receptors on the cells surface. data presented is the average from  <dig> independent experiments carried out in triplicate. statistically significant difference compared to no drug, * = p <  <dig> , .

no recycling could be observed after treatment with ndmc , 71% cell surface receptor after  <dig> hours of recycling .

allosteric and orthosteric m <dig> agonists induce down-regulation of m <dig> receptors in cho-m <dig> cells
the extent of down-regulation of m <dig> receptors following treatment with various ligands was measured in cho cells stably expressing hm <dig> receptors. treatment of the cells with all the orthosteric and allosteric ligands for  <dig> hours resulted in a loss of total receptor binding . treatment with similar concentrations of the agonists for  <dig> hours did not result in any loss of -qnb binding, confirming proper removal of ligands from the cells . receptor down-regulation induced by each of these ligands was mediated by interaction with the m <dig> receptors, as it could be blocked by treatment with the muscarinic antagonists atropine  , scopolamine  or pirenzepine  .

allosteric and orthosteric m <dig> agonists induce recruitment of β-arrestin- <dig> to m <dig> receptors
the ability of different muscarinic agonists to induce association of the m <dig> receptors with β-arrestin- <dig> in real time was quantified using the bret- <dig> assay. most ligands were able to induce an association of the receptor with β-arrestin- <dig>  albeit with different potencies and efficacies . relative efficacies of the compounds were determined as compared to carbachol. oxotremorine-m was a full agonist in this assay, while pilocarpine, xanomeline, ac- <dig>  and ac- <dig>  were partial agonists with relative efficacies in the range of 12-26%. ndmc did not show any agonist activity at m <dig> as measured by bret- <dig> 

m <dig> bret- <dig> assays were performed to determine potency and efficacy of agonists to stimulate β-arrestin- <dig> recruitment. data presented are mean ± s.d. from 2- <dig> independent experiments carried out in triplicate. statistically significant difference compared to no drug, * = p <  <dig> , . based on student t-test, efficacies for ac- <dig>  ac- <dig>  xanomeline and pilocarpine were not statistically different, p >  <dig> . na: no measurable agonist activity.

m <dig> receptor endocytosis is distinctively affected by ac- <dig> an ac- <dig> related ligand
to determine whether the lack of induction of receptor endocytosis observed with ac- <dig> was unique to this compound or to other compounds with similar structure, the effects of three closely related compounds with various activities  on receptor internalization were assessed. while two of these compounds induced translocation of the receptors from cell surface into intracellular vesicles in hek- <dig> cells, one compound, ac- <dig>  did not . this data indicates that even compounds with close structural similarity to ac- <dig> can behave differently with respect to inducing receptor endocytosis.

activities of ac- <dig> analogues on human m <dig> receptors were assessed using r-sat in transiently transfected nih-3t <dig> cells. data presented are mean ± sd from 5- <dig> independent experiments carried out in triplicate.

ac- <dig> and xanomeline induce persistent activation of m <dig> receptors
to investigate other ligand-mediated receptor modifications, changes in receptor coupling were assessed in cho-m <dig> cells treated with various ligands. cells were briefly exposed to each agonist and pi accumulation was measured following removal of the agonist. basal levels of pi hydrolysis were elevated after only one minute of exposure to ac- <dig> and xanomeline. elevation of basal receptor activity was not seen following treatment with carbachol, ndmc or ac- <dig> . these data suggest that only one minute of treatment with ac- <dig> and xanomeline can induce a modification in the receptor conformation resulting in continuous signaling of the receptor in the absence of continued presence of the agonist. this increased basal activity of the receptors following treatment with ac- <dig> and xanomeline was partially blocked in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inverse agonist atropine .

discussion
the present study was designed to characterize various receptor regulatory pathways initiated after treatment with allosteric or orthosteric m1agonists. we demonstrate that specific regulatory pathways initiated after activation of m <dig> receptors with different ligands are unique to each ligand and not due to the allosteric or orthosteric nature of receptor-ligand interaction.

among the m <dig> agonists in the present study, ac- <dig> and ac- <dig> have been characterized as allosteric agonists  <cit> . other compounds, ndmc and xanomeline, were reported to have an allosteric component in their interaction with m <dig> receptors  <cit> . carbachol, oxotremorine-m and pilocarpine are classical orthosteric agonists.

all agonists in this study were characterized as either full agonists or high efficacy partial agonists at m <dig> receptors as measured by rsat and pi assays. no correlation could be made between efficacy or potency of each agonist and its efficacy in activation of various receptor regulatory processes. moreover, none of the agonists studied induced receptor desensitization, as measured by the lack of a shift in carbachol dose response curve or a change in maximal response in pi hydrolysis assay . still, the possibility of desensitization of other signaling pathways cannot be ruled out.

to assess the differences in receptor regulatory processes induced by each agonist, the extent of loss of cell surface receptors and total receptors were evaluated. all ligands were capable of inducing a loss of receptor binding. these results indicate that the processes of receptor internalization and down-regulation are induced after treatment with all these ligands.

to further assess receptor internalization/endocytosis, confocal microscopy was used to visualize receptor localization. after treatment with orthosteric ligands, carbachol, pilocarpine and oxotremorine-m, m <dig> receptors could be visualized in endosomes. however, after treatment of the cells with the allosteric agonist ac- <dig>  no receptors could be observed in the endosomes. to test the hypothesis that allosteric interaction with the receptors was responsible for this difference, we tested several other allosteric agonists for their propensity to induce receptor endocytosis into endosomes. the allosteric ligands ac- <dig> and ndmc were able to induce receptor internalization/endocytosis, while xanomeline was not. to determine whether lack of endocytosis was associated with the specific structure of ac- <dig>  three close analogues of this compound were studied. two of these compounds induced internalization/endocytosis of m <dig> receptor while one did not. these results indicate that allosteric nature of the ligand-receptor interaction is not sufficient explanation for lack of ligand-induced endocytosis.

it was puzzling that no intracellular vesicles could be seen after treatment with ac- <dig> and xanomeline while binding to cell surface receptors was reduced after treatment with these ligands. one possible reason for this observation could be induction of different endocytic pathways by these ligands. it has been previously demonstrated that carbachol-induced internalization of m <dig> receptors is mediated via clathrin-coated pits  <cit> . formation of clathrin-coated vesicles can be blocked by treatment with hypertonic sucrose solution  <cit> . in order to investigate whether ac- <dig> and xanomeline induce similar endocytic pathways as carbachol, cells were pretreated with hypertonic sucrose solution to block formation of clathrin coated vesicles. hypertonic sucrose treatment blocked receptor internalization induced by all the agonists, indicating that formation of clathrin coated vesicles is necessary for the loss of cell surface receptor binding after treatment with all these ligands. this observation suggests that divergence of receptor regulatory processes induced by the different ligands occur down-stream from the formation of clathrin-coated pits.

internalization of g-protein coupled receptors has been shown to involve interaction with β-arrestin  <cit> . moreover, it has been suggested that endocytosis and signaling of muscarinic m <dig> receptors involve interaction with β-arrestin  <cit> . in order to determine if absence of interaction with β-arrestin attributed towards the differences observed in vesicle formation, interaction of m <dig> receptors with β-arrestin- <dig> was assessed using bret- <dig> assays. all ligands studied were able to stimulate recruitment of β-arrestin- <dig> to m <dig> receptors. while carbachol and oxotremorine-m were full agonists in bret- <dig> assay, all other ligands, including pilocarpine, were partial agonists. other studies have also described pilocarpine as a partial agonist at m <dig> receptors  <cit> . although ac- <dig> and xanomeline stimulated an increase in the bret- <dig> signal with lower efficacy compared to carbachol and oxotremorine-m, the lower efficacy in this interaction could not explain the absence of vesicle formation in response to these ligands. this conclusion is based on the fact that while both ac- <dig> and pilocarpine have similar potency and efficacy in the bret- <dig> assay compared to ac- <dig> and xanomeline, both compounds can induce receptor endocytosis into endosomes.

another difference observed between the receptor regulatory processes induced by the different agonists was the difference seen in the recycling of the receptors back to the cell surface. while m <dig> receptors recycled back to the cell surface after treatment with orthosteric ligands  following treatment with allosteric ligands  and ligand removal, binding to cell surface receptors remained low. these results suggest that after removal from the cell surface, receptors sequestered following treatment with the latter set of compounds do not return to the cell surface. we have shown that after a brief treatment with some of these ligands, m <dig> receptors remain active and produce higher basal levels of inositol phosphates. thus, it is likely that receptors treated with these ligands remain in a sequestered state and continue to signal via g-proteins  or other signaling proteins. following this continued signaling event, the receptors are then processed through various degradative processes and subsequently destroyed.

based on the classical paradigm for gpcr regulation, receptor activation by agonist leads to rapid phosphorylation, interaction with β-arrestin and sequestration into clathrin-coated pits. coated pits containing the receptors pinch off the plasma membrane into intracellular vesicles via a dynamin mediated process. internalized receptors are then de-phosphorylated and recycled back to the cell surface for further stimulation  or are routed to the lysosomes for degradation, a process known as down-regulation  <cit> . our results indicate that activation of m <dig> receptors by allosteric ligands do not stimulate the recycling pathway in hek- <dig> cells. absence of receptor recycling by these ligands implies that m <dig> receptors stimulated by these agonists remain sequestered and continue to signal or are routed to the lysosomes for degradation . in addition to its role in receptor regulation, receptor endocytosis has been implicated in signaling of gpcrs  <cit> . signaling pattern of m <dig> receptors following treatment of the cells with various agonists was assessed. interaction of m <dig> receptors with caveolin after treatment with various ligands was evaluated using confocal microscopy. as seen previously for carbachol  <cit> , no co-localization of m <dig> receptors with caveolin was observed after treatment with any of the allosteric agonists studied . the possibility of receptors continuing to signal after treatment with some ligands and not others was assessed by measuring inositol phosphates following only  <dig> minute of treatment with the ligands. while no changes in basal levels of pi hydrolysis could be observed after treatment with carbachol and oxotremorine-m, treatment with ac- <dig> and xanomeline resulted in increased basal levels of inositol phosphates. these results suggest that treatment with these compounds could render a conformational change in the receptor that may possibly lead to continued signaling of m <dig> receptors.

based on the results of these studies, it may be more appropriate to classify the agonists studied  on the basis of their activation of various cellular processes rather than by the mode of interaction with various domains of the receptor. thus, we can classify these ligands as follows;  carbachol and oxotremorine-m fully activate all processes investigated.  pilocarpine can fully activate all processes except it is a partial agonist in bret- <dig> assay.  ndmc and ac- <dig> are partial agonists of various signaling pathways of m <dig> receptors; fully activate internalization and down-regulation of the receptors, but not receptor recycling processes.  ac- <dig> and xanomeline are full agonists at m <dig> as assessed by rsat and pi, but are partial agonists in bret- <dig> assay. both these compounds induce loss of cell surface and total receptors, but no recycling or vesicle formation can be measured after treatment with these compounds. moreover, treatment with these compounds can possibly induce continued signaling of m <dig> receptors. these last two compounds have the most diverse mode of interaction with m <dig> receptors compared to all other agonist studied.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from the present study indicate that m <dig> signaling and regulatory pathways induced by different allosteric m <dig> agonists are ligand specific. allosteric agonists differ from orthosteric agonists and amongst each other in their ability to induce different regulatory processes for m <dig> receptors. moreover, it is important to note that although there are differences in how multiple types of agonists can regulate the activity of m <dig> receptors, activation with allosteric ligands, like activation with orthosteric ligands, ultimately results in receptor internalization/down-regulation. thus, it is expected that the normal physiological limits on receptor signaling will occur regardless of which agonist is used.
