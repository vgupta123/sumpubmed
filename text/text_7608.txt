BACKGROUND
copy number variants  are a type of genomic polymorphism that potentially underlie a significant fraction of phenotypic variation  <cit> . cnvs are structural variants, defined as stretches of dna that are greater than  <dig> kilobase  in size and are duplicated or deleted in the genome of some individuals  <cit> . mutation rate estimates for cnvs vary from  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  <cit>  to 1 × 10− <dig> per locus per generation  <cit> , which reflects the diverse processes by which cnvs are created. they can be over  <dig> megabase   <cit>  and are thought to comprise approximately 1 % of an individual’s genome, which is much higher than the  <dig>  % thought to comprise snps  <cit> . cnvs can be present in the same or overlapping regions of the genome in multiple individuals, these regions are called copy number variant regions . copy number variants are distinct from another type of variant, indels , in that indels are typically less than 1 kb  <cit> . by definition they are also distinct from segmental duplications . segmental duplications are defined as being over 1 kb in length with at least 90 % sequence identity between the duplicated segments and are often not polymorphic in the population  <cit> . in many cases it is likely that segmental duplications were once cnvs that have subsequently become fixed in the population.

there are many examples, particularly in humans, of cnvs influencing traits. these include multiple examples of cnvs associated with cancer susceptibility , the association of the fcgr3b gene copy number variant with systemic lupus erythematosus   <cit> , and ccl3l <dig> gene copy number, which has been linked to hiv susceptibility  <cit> . there is also evidence for cnvs influencing traits in other animal and livestock species. a 133 kb duplication containing four genes causes hair ridge in rhodesian and thai ridgeback dogs  <cit> . the chicken peacomb phenotype is under sexual selection and is caused by a  <dig>  kb duplication in an intron of the sox <dig> gene  <cit> . the peacomb allele contains ~ <dig> copies of the duplication, with variation in copy number present within individuals with the peacomb phenotype. in pigs, chen et al.  <cit>  found seven copy number variable genes that overlapped quantitative trait loci  for, among other traits, carcass length, backfat thickness, abdominal fat weight, length of scapular, intramuscular fat content of longissimus muscle, body weight at 240 days and glycolytic potential of longissimus muscle. although not an association analysis, chen et al.  <cit>  identified one cnv that had previously been associated with skin colour in pigs  <cit> .

there have been many cnv studies in cattle, with a range of platforms used to identify cnvs . between  <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs  <cit>  have been identified in the various cattle studies, with estimates of the proportion of the cattle genome thought to contain cnvrs ranging from  <dig>  to 20 %  <cit> . although the latter is likely to be an overestimate, the wide range in estimates is likely due to a number of factors, including the technology used to detect cnvs, different cnv calling criteria used, and the number of animals examined.

while there is one notable example of a cnv having a direct effect on a sheep trait – the agouti duplication influencing coat colour  <cit>  - to date, little work has been published on copy number variants in the sheep genome. an initial survey assayed eleven sheep on a cattle roche-nimblegen 385 k oligonucleotide cgh array  which included  <dig>  probes that were designed based on the cattle genome build btau_ <dig>   <cit> . that study identified  <dig> cnv regions  that covered approximately  <dig>  % of the sheep genome and ~ <dig> – <dig>  % of each individual’s genome, which is substantially less than the approximately 1 % estimated by pang et al.  <cit>  in humans. this suggests many more sheep cnvs remain to be identified.

a number of approaches have been used to detect the presence of cnv. the main platforms are comparative genomic hybridisation  arrays , snp arrays  and depth of coverage metrics applied to whole genome sequence data . further, there are a variety of algorithms that can be used to analyse available resultant data. perhaps the most widely used platform is array cgh, as it represents a cost-effective method to detect cnvs on a genome-wide scale in multiple individuals  <cit> .

trios have been used in cnv studies to determine the de novo mutation rate and to identify cnvs that represent heritable genetic units  <cit> . this involves identifying cnvs in a father-mother-progeny trio. cnvs present in progeny and at least one parent are thought of as heritable and cnvs present in progeny but not in either parent indicate either a de novo mutation or an error in cnv identification. given that cnvs are difficult to detect regardless of the platform or methods used, the best approach appears to be the conservative use of multiple methods to generate a set of high confidence cnv calls.

given the lack of a comprehensive study of sheep cnvs, the objective of this study was to conduct a survey of sheep cnvrs using a range of detection methods. a roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array was designed and  <dig> animals  were assayed. independent detection approaches were used in an attempt to validate the results. finally, the cnvrs detected in this study were compared to those reported in an earlier survey of the sheep genome  <cit>  and those detected in seven separate cattle studies .

RESULTS
roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array construction and application
a total of four methodologies were used to detect cnv, with the main approach being the development and application of a  <dig> m probe cgh array for the sheep genome. in total,  <dig> , <dig> probes were designed with an average spacing across the autosomes of approximately  <dig>  kb. the array was used to assay a total of  <dig> sheep genomes, consisting of  <dig> individuals drawn from the international mapping flock  <cit>  and a further six from a reference panel of international sheep genomics consortium  sheep . the roche-nimblegen segmnt algorithm was used to call cnv segments in each animal compared to the reference animal. many different algorithms and criteria can be used to identify cnvs in array cgh data. criteria employed to filter cgh data include restricting calls based on probe number within the cnv segment and log <dig> ratio  ; conrad et al.  <cit> ); ). these criteria are often selected using the results from a self-self hybridisation experiment, whereby self-self calls are used to indicate false positive calls, and rely on the assumption that the self-self hybridisation cnv calls cover the range of characteristics of false positive calls. it requires selecting a balance between filter values for number of probes and log <dig> ratio, so as to eliminate self-self hybridisation calls and other false positives from the dataset. other studies have used differences between expected versus observed probe intensities on the sex chromosomes to set log <dig> ratio filters . however, this does not account for possible probe number differences between true versus false cnv calls. as well as these filtering criteria, trios can be used to identify cnvs .

in this study, rather than using self-self hybridisation results to empirically set filters to remove false positives, a combination of trios and self-self hybridisation results were used to develop a logistic regression model for predicting whether or not a cnv segment represented a true cnv. the logistic regression model was developed using known positives  and known false positives  and the following variables were tested to determine if they were significant in predicting true versus false cnv segment calls: absolute log <dig> ratio of the cnv segment call; whether the call was a deletion or duplication; length of the call ; natural log transformed length variable; double natural log transformed length variable; the square of the length variable; number of probes in the cnv segment call; natural log transformed probe variable; double natural log transformed probe variable; the square of the probe variable; and corresponding two- and three-way interactions. the variables that were significant in predicting true versus false cnv segment calls were the absolute log <dig> ratio of the cnv segment call, the double natural log transformed length variable and the double natural log transformed probe variable. the resultant model was then used to predict true cnvs in the wider dataset, with some further downstream processing. the total number of autosomal segment calls predicted to represent true cnvs by our model, using cgh data from  <dig> animals, was  <dig> . after removing calls based on a series of quality filters, a total of  <dig>  autosomal cnv calls remained . the mean absolute log <dig> ratio of these calls was  <dig>  and the average length was 30 kb with a range in length of 1 kb– <dig>  mb .table  <dig> characteristics of cnvs predicted true by the model  and filtered to remove artefacts

on average,  <dig> cnvs were detected per individual, with a median of  <dig> and range of  <dig> to  <dig>  one animal had notably more cnv calls than the other animals, however, it had the same cnv content on the autosomes  as the other animals.

autosomal cnvr
cnv information from all animals was combined to obtain  <dig>  cnv regions on the ovine autosomes . the average length of these cnvrs was 19 kb, with a range of 1 kb to  <dig>  mb. shorter cnvrs were more frequent than longer cnvrs in the genome. the total length of all cnvrs was  <dig> mbps, which equates to  <dig>  % of the sheep autosomes. for individuals, this value ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. most cnvrs were seen in just one animal , however  <dig>   were independently called in at least  <dig> individuals. a small percentage  of cnvrs were observed in all animals, which likely indicates the presence of a cnv in the reference animal only - the ‘reference effect’  <cit> . the majority of cnvrs  contained only deletion cnvs, 38 % of cnvrs contained only duplication cnvs and 4 % were compound cnvrs, containing both duplication and deletion cnvs.fig.  <dig> cnvr frequency across animals



the number of cnvrs on each chromosome ranged from  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . as can be seen in fig.  <dig>  there was a weak positive linear relationship between chromosome length and number of cnvrs .fig.  <dig> number of cnvrs by chromosome length. labels correspond to chromosome number



the average spacing between cnvrs ranged from one every 347kbp on chromosome  <dig> to one every  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  the closest cnvrs were approximately  <dig>  kb apart, while the largest distance separating cnvrs was  <dig> mbps. the two-sample kolmogorov-smirnov test showed that the distribution of the cnvrs in the genome  was significantly different to that which would be expected should the cnvrs be uniformly distributed . specifically, the cnvrs tended to be clustered together in the genome .fig.  <dig> cumulative density plot of the distances separating cnvrs. the red line reflects the observed pairwise distances between cnvrs, while the blue line reflects the simulated  distances separating cnvrs



cross platform verification of autosomal cnvrs in sheep
a small subset of animals assayed with the  <dig> m cgh array were also used for data generation with a lower density 385 k cgh array , the ovinesnp <dig> beadchip  and whole genome sequence from the six reference panel animals . this facilitated an examination of the proportion of cnvrs independently called across platforms.

the verification rate of cnvrs identified on the  <dig> m cgh array on both the 385 k cgh array and the ovinesnp <dig> beadchip was low. results from these analyses are presented in an additional file .

the final comparison utilised analysis of whole genome sequence from the six reference panel animals. each individual was sequenced to between  <dig> x and 14x genome wide coverage before variation in read depth was used to detect cnvr . the same six animals had  <dig> cnvrs arising from  <dig>  cnv calls detected using the  <dig> m cgh array. comparing the cnv calls revealed 61 % of the roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array cnv calls were independently identified in the sequence data . two thirds of the cnv calls that were verified were observed as a consistent deletion or duplication cnv across platforms in a specific animal. the remaining verified cnvs were observed as a cnv of the opposite type  in the poll dorset animal. this animal was used as the reference animal on the roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array and therefore cnvs in this animal can be incorrectly observed as cnvs in the test animal when in fact no cnv is present in the test animal. that is, a deletion in the poll dorset may be observed as a duplication in the test animal on the  <dig> m cgh array, while in the sequence data, the test animal shows no cnv in the region but the poll dorset shows a deletion. the same is true for duplications in the poll dorset, which will be observed as deletions in the test animal, even if no cnv is present in the test animal in that region.table  <dig> cross platform verification results. number of cnv calls that were verified and not verified



there were instances where the sequence data showed that there was a cnv in the poll dorset and the test animal in the same region, but the type  of cnv in the test animal was not consistent between the  <dig> m cgh array and sequence platforms. for example, a  <dig> m cgh deletion that was observed as a duplication in the test and reference animal in the sequence data. these calls were considered to be verified as there were still cnvs present in the sequence data and it is possible that the magnitude of the log <dig> ratio of the cnv call on the  <dig> m cgh array was higher in the poll dorset than the test animal which could result in inconsistencies between the types of cnvs detected. there were instances in the data where a cnv call of one particular cnv region could be verified in one animal and not in another animal, which indicates that the cnv is likely present in both animals but the sequence analysis failed to identify the cnv in one of the animals.

significant differences in absolute log <dig> ratio, length and gc content were observed between the sequence verified and non-verified  <dig> m cgh array calls. verified calls had higher absolute log <dig> ratios  and were longer  on average than non-verified calls. this suggests that longer calls with higher absolute log <dig> ratios are either more likely to represent true cnvs or are easier to verify than shorter calls with lower absolute log <dig> ratios. sequence corresponding to non-verified calls showed significantly higher  gc content on average compared to verified calls -  <dig>  versus  <dig>  %. both verified and non-verified calls had significantly higher gc content compared to the genome average . more duplications  than deletions were verified on the sequence platform -  <dig>  % versus  <dig>  %. this is not surprising, as there was less variation in the sequence data in regions with low read depth, which reduces the ability to detect differences in copy number in these regions and hence also cnvs relating to deletions.

comparison of autosomal cnvrs to those identified in the sheep and cattle literature
in total, we detected  <dig>  of the  <dig>  cnvrs reported in seven other sheep and cattle studies. of the  <dig>  cnvs detected in the seven other studies,  <dig> were present in more than one study. we detected  <dig>  of the  <dig> cnvs observed in multiple studies, whereas we only detected 14 % of the cnvrs observed in just one other study . the more frequently a cnvr was observed in the other studies, the more likely we were to detect the cnvr . we were able to detect 31 % of the cnvrs identified in the initial sheep study by fontanesi et al.  <cit>  and between  <dig> and 62 % of cnvrs detected in the cattle studies.table  <dig> comparison between cnvrs observed in this study and cnvrs observed in the literature



eleven percent of the  <dig>  cnvrs detected in this study and successfully mapped to the btau_ <dig>  genome overlapped cnvrs in these other studies. this is lower than would be expected based on overlap between cnvrs from the other studies with each other, which ranges from 20–77 %. by comparison, 28 % of the cnvrs from the sheep study by fontanesi et al.  <cit>  were observed in at least one of the cattle studies.

overlap between autosomal cnvrs and genes
of the  <dig>  cnvrs identified on the roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array that mapped to oarv <dig> autosomes,  <dig>   overlapped the coding sequence of one or more genes; 45 % of duplication cnvrs, 36 % of deletion cnvrs and 59 % of deletion/duplication cnvrs overlapped genes. the proportion of duplications overlapping the coding sequence of genes was significantly different  to the proportion of deletions overlapping genes. based on permutation analysis, these proportions were significantly greater than that which would be expected if the cnvrs were randomly distributed in the genome . both the agouti signalling protein and adenosylhomocysteinase genes were overlapped by one of our cnvrs, which confirms the presence of the agouti duplication reported by norris and whan  <cit>  in this dataset, and thus provides a positive control for the cnvr identification methods presented here. it is important to note that the agouti duplication can be present in multiple copies  <cit> , hence the reason that it shows up even upon comparison to another white fleeced sheep.

non-autosomal cnvrs
the total number of chromosome x roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array segment calls predicted to be real was  <dig>  however,  <dig> of these were observed as deletions in males. it is possible some of these are real, particularly if they are present in the pseudo-autosomal region, however, this cannot be confirmed in our analysis as we do not have a clear pseudo-autosomal boundary defined. after filtering all  <dig> cnv calls based on size and log <dig> ratios,  <dig> of these were predicted to be real, however, only  <dig> were either deletions or duplications in females or duplications in males. these  <dig> were used to call cnvrs on chromosome x. in total, we estimate there are at least  <dig> cnvrs on chromosome x, representing approximately  <dig>  % of the length of the x chromosome. in addition to chromosome x cnvrs, four cnvrs were identified on umd3_oa_chrun, observed in one to ten animals. these cnvrs spanned a total length of  <dig>  bps.

including the  <dig>  cnvrs observed on the autosomes, the  <dig> cnvrs observed on chromosome x and the  <dig> cnvrs identified on chromosome unknown , we estimate there to be approximately  <dig>  cnvrs in the sheep genome. this includes cnvrs identified on chromosome x and umd3_oa_chrun. the total length of these  <dig>  cnvrs is estimated to be  <dig> mbps, however, it is possible that some of the cnvrs on umd3_oa_chrun may overlap those identified on the autosomes and therefore this number may be slightly lower.

discussion
the results reported here provide a genome wide view of the frequency of cnv, an important class of genomic variant that is currently poorly characterised in the sheep genome. using a custom built roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array,  <dig>  autosomal cnvs were detected in  <dig> sheep. on average these cnvs covered  <dig>  % of each animal’s genome. this is higher than that reported in the initial sheep survey where, on average,  <dig>  % of an individual sheep genome comprised cnvs  <cit> . the difference in estimates is not surprising as this study used a cgh array with  <dig>  million probes while fontanesi et al.  <cit>  used a cgh array with  <dig>  probes. based on probe spacing in the genome and the filters applied to the data, the earlier study detected cnvs greater than 30 kb in length, on average, while this study had a resolution of ~4 kb on average. as a result, differences in resolution may have resulted in differences in the number of cnvs detected. this is reflected in the datasets, with the average size of cnvs detected by fontanesi et al.  <cit>  being  <dig>  kb  and the average size detected in this study being  <dig>  kb . the individual genome cnv composition estimates are similar to, but slightly lower than, estimates reported in humans .

the  <dig>  autosomal cnvs reported in this study correspond to  <dig>  autosomal cnv regions in the  <dig> animals tested, representing  <dig>  % of the sheep genome. this is approximately seven times higher than estimated in the initial sheep survey  <cit> , which is to be expected as more animals were assayed in this study. this estimate is similar to the range of estimates in cattle  and again similar but slightly lower than estimates in humans . estimates in humans are likely to provide a more accurate estimate of cnv composition in the genome, as studies have involved more individuals and used a wider range of technologies, often employed together. as in the fontanesi et al.  <cit>  study, this study suffers from the lack of a complete reference sheep genome. we used a sheep genome that was constructed using a cattle reference genome to design probes for inclusion on the  <dig> m cgh array. the genome used, umd3_oa, does not include any regions that are present in the sheep genome but that are not present in the cattle genome. this means that sheep cnvs in regions deleted or of low homology in the cattle genome are likely to have been undetected in this study. future work will benefit from using a sheep reference genome for cnv analysis. however, the cnvrs presented in this study provide a substantial addition to the currently published sheep cnv regions, and bring the resource up to a level similar to that available in cattle.

there were also  <dig> cnvrs identified on chromosome x and chromosome unknown. however, these were lower confidence calls and were not considered in further analyses. of the  <dig>  autosomal cnvrs identified in this study, 59 % were observed in just one animal, which is comparable to results in the literature  <cit> . one and a half times more deletions than duplications were observed. this imbalance is one that is commonly reported in the literature  <cit>  and could be due to ascertainment bias. the ascertainment bias arises because the proportional difference between probe intensity of test and reference animals is greater for copy number losses than gains meaning that deletions are easier to detect than duplications.

the cnvrs detected in this study tended to be clustered together in the genome. this may be an artefact of the segmnt algorithm and our cnvr calling algorithm, which may have failed to collapse multiple cnvrs originating from one cnvr into one region. however, similar distributions have been reported in other studies  and also for the closely related segmental duplication variant  <cit> . if this clustering represents the true underlying distribution in the genome, then it may indicate that the clustered cnvrs are the result of increased mutational activity in repetitive regions of the genome which could facilitate mechanisms such as non-allelic homologous recombination  <cit> . determining if the cnvrs are a result of one mutational event or multiple mutational events would require detailed analysis of specific regions, probably using deep sequencing.

there are reports in the literature that cnvrs are preferentially located outside of gene regions  <cit>  and that those cnvs that do overlap genes are more likely to be duplications than deletions  <cit> . the rationale is that deletions are more disruptive to gene function than duplications and therefore are subject to greater selective pressure. in this study, a significant difference was observed in the proportion of duplications overlapping the coding sequence of genes compared to deletions -  <dig>  versus  <dig> . however, both of these proportions were significantly higher than would be expected if cnvrs were randomly distributed throughout the genome. therefore, in this study there is no evidence to suggest that the cnvrs identified in this study are preferentially excluded from genic regions as has been suggested in the literature. other results reported in the literature have also found an enrichment of cnvs in these regions  <cit> . cooper et al.  <cit>  suggest that cnvs that overlap segmental duplications  are more likely to be enriched in genic regions, while cnvs that do not overlap sds are enriched in gene poor regions of the genome. as genes and segmental duplications are gc rich  <cit>  and gc rich regions are more prone to cnv formation, then it is possible that certain types of cnvs are enriched in genic regions. while selection against or for cnvs and cnv formation mechanisms are reasonable explanations for the depletion or enrichment of cnvs in genic regions, it is also possible that differences reported in the literature are due to ascertainment bias introduced by using different methods for cnv detection. again, this illustrates the difficulties associated with cnv identification.

compared to the lower density 385 k cgh array and the ovinesnp <dig> beadchip, whole genome sequencing exhibited the highest cross platform verification rate, with 61 % of cnvs verified with this platform. the cnvs that were unable to be verified were shorter and had lower absolute log <dig> ratios than calls that were able to be verified. both verified and non-verified cnvs had significantly higher gc content than the genome average, which supports data from the literature reporting that gc-rich regions can be more prone to cnv formation  <cit> . non-verified cnvs had significantly higher gc content than verified cnvs. while it is possible that the non-verified cnvs were false negatives in the sequence analysis, it is also possible that they were false positives in the cgh dataset, as false positive cgh calls can be related to regions with high gc content  <cit> . future work could involve adjusting cgh intensity data for gc content.

this study detected 18 % of the cnvrs reported in seven other sheep and cattle studies . thirty one percent of the cnvrs that were previously detected in an initial survey of cnvs in the sheep genome  <cit>  were detected in this study. we were able to identify all of the cnvrs that were observed in six of the other studies, but only 14 % of cnvrs observed in just one other study. in fact, the more studies a cnvr was detected in, the more likely we were able to identify the cnvr in our analysis. this trend was also reported by kijas et al.  <cit> . this suggests that either these cnvrs are less likely to be false positives or they may be more common than the cnvrs detected in just one study or, alternatively, they may be more likely to occur in both sheep and cattle. common cnvrs will be present in more individuals in the population and therefore are more likely to be observed in the diverse range of animals tested in the different studies. reasons that this study was unable to detect many of the cnvs from the other studies include: cnvs that occur in cattle but not sheep; rare cnvs not seen in our sample of sheep; and false negatives in our study due in part to the different methods used for cnv detection. similarly, only a small number  of cnvrs identified in this study overlapped cnvs detected in these seven other studies. again, lack of overlap could be due to the different species or individual animals tested, different methods used for cnv detection, false negatives in other studies and false positives in our dataset. confirmation rates varied widely across the studies compared to our results. variation in confirmation rates from different studies has also been reported in the literature for human cnv studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, comprehensive information from trios, multiple platforms and different algorithms were used with the aim of verifying cnv segment calls from the roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array. cnvs are difficult to verify and as is observed in the literature, a combination of approaches appears to be the best way to accurately detect cnvs on a large scale. it is likely that comprehensive sequencing or qpcr would provide clearer information about individual cnv regions and give an indication of the accuracy of the methods used to detect them. regardless, characteristics of the cnv regions detected in this study are comparable to those reported in the literature, and the cnv regions identified here add to the initial survey of cnvs in the sheep genome by fontanesi et al.  <cit> .
