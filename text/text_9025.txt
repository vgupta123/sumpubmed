BACKGROUND
in recent years some advances have been made in the methods of investigation of the molecular background of canine heart disease. the etiopathogenesis of one of the most frequent heart diseases, myxomatous valve disease, in dogs may be different compared to humans although some similarities have been noted
 <cit> . some research has been conducted to identify specific genes which, when pathologically expressed, could lead to the dysfunction of the canine heart or are correlated with heart failure. for this purpose genome wide microarray experiments on tissues from failing hearts have been performed. their results revealed that expression of some genes differ between tissue samples from failing hearts and healthy hearts, including: the matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors  as well as genes involved in ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes, e.g. genes encoding the components of the cardiac ryanodyne receptor 
. other examples of differentially expressed genes are tgf-β  and serotonin receptors 
 <cit> . the genome pattern of heart tissues from dogs suffering from heart failure were also investigated with the real-time pcr method and the level of proteins encoded by differentially expressed genes was examined by immunohistochemical techniques. these findings gave similar results and pointed out different expression of extracellular matrix  genes, tgf-β receptors and thyroid hormone receptors  in failing hearts compared to healthy control tissues
.

the most important obstacle of the mentioned types of studies is access to diagnostic material. that is why researchers are attempting to investigate gene expression of peripheral blood nuclear cells taken from patients with cardiac disease. blood nuclear cells are not a perfect source of diagnostic material in patients with heart failure but easy access makes them a very interesting source of potential disease markers. it has turned out that identification of such markers is possible since wang et al. described the prognostic value of b-natriuretic peptide  in humans
 <cit> . the results of a few studies suggest that expression of na + −ca2+ exchanger  gene in peripheral blood nuclear cells could have prognostic or diagnostic value
 <cit> . the other genes proposed as genomic markers in dogs are phospholamban  and haematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein  <dig> associated protein x- <dig> . fonfara et al. also pointed out that the blood cells of dogs with heart failure could be appropriate material for searching for genomic markers. their results showed increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines , mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> and decreased levels of tnf- <dig>  il- <dig>  tgf-b <dig>  timp- <dig> and timp- <dig> in dogs with congestive heart failure
 <cit> .

in the present paper a whole genome microarray analysis was used for the first time to describe the transcription profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells in dogs with heart failure. the potential identification of any prognostic marker of canine cardiac disease would be of great importance since it may not only give new insight into the pathogenesis or staging of the disease but also help in the effective planning of treatment.

RESULTS
the number of differentially expressed genes
comparison of gene expression between all study groups  revealed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. using the tukey's hsd post-hoc test it was possible to identify differentially expressed transcripts between individual study groups .table  <dig>

heart failure specific and isachc stage specific genes
the next step of our analysis was to identify heart-failure-specific genes. this means genes which were differentially expressed in all dogs with heart disease, despite the stage of the disease. the comparison between healthy and isachc  <dig> group revealed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts; between healthy and isachc  <dig> dogs revealed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts and between healthy and isachc  <dig> dogs revealed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. among these three sets of differentially expressed genes there were  <dig> common transcripts. however, since some genes are represented on the array by more than one spot, we verified the consistency of differential expression in all the spots representing the same genes to eliminate false positive results. moreover, the ontologies of all the transcripts are not known. taking into consideration these two facts, a list of  <dig> heart - failure - specific genes of known ontologies was obtained . the direction of changes in expression  of all  <dig> genes was the same in each disease stage. if a gene was down-regulated, this means that it was down regulated in all three comparisons .table  <dig>

after identifying heart - failure - specific genes we applied the same approach to a selection of each stage - specific genes. the  <dig> genes specific for isachc class  <dig> were identified . the list of isachc class  <dig> - specific genes was the longest and consisted on  <dig> genes . in cases of most advanced disease, isachc  <dig>  the list of specific genes was  <dig> . these four lists of genes were subjected to further analysis.

pathways connected with differentially expressed genes
next we examined the differentially regulated genes for enrichment in any known canonical pathway. for this purpose the pathway studio software was used. the most interesting results were obtained from analysis of the ariadne receptor signaling pathways. the results of this analysis are presented in tables

discussion
heart failure in dogs does not occur as frequently as it does in humans and is mainly caused by two diseases, namely endocardiosis  and dilated cardiomyopathy. both these diseases can lead to congestive heart failure and the associated clinical signs. since the molecular background of these diseases, especially endocardiosis, is still far from fully elucidated, the search for any specific markers  of this disease would be of great value.

in the present study we evaluated the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells of dogs with different stages of heart disease. since the whole analysis resulted in the huge number of differentially expressed transcripts  we decided to identify two types of genes - 1) genes differentially expressed in all affected dogs, despite the isachc stage  and 2) genes differentially expressed in each of isachc stages . this approach seems reasonable because if the gene is regulated in all patients with heart failure, despite the stage of the disease, it could be a potential marker of heart disease in dogs. on the other hand the identification of each isachc stage-specific gene give the opportunity to identify markers of heart disease progression .

the list of heart-failure specific genes included  <dig> transcripts for which we were able to identify  <dig> specific genes. among these genes we were able to identify three α-sma genes which are considered as a markers of muscle cells. this phenomenon could suggest the presence of myofibroblasts  in the peripheral blood nuclear cells of dogs with heart failure. similar observation has been recently published in humans with atrial fibrillation what could indicate that heart disease could be related with the presence of α-sma containing cells in the blood
 <cit> . however, α-sma containing cells could also be of hematopoietic progenitor cells origin so their source in the blood of heart disease patients is still unclear
 <cit> . moreover, our results of flow cytometer analysis showed that the percentage of α-sma positive cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of three dogs with isachc class  <dig> heart failure was between  <dig> - <dig> % . whether these cells could be a marker of heart disease remains a pure speculation. other genes present among  <dig> heart failure specific genes have been previously related to heart failure or involved in heart disease development. examples include matrix metallopeptidase  <dig>  and timp metallopeptidase inhibitor  <dig> . it is known that remodelling of the extracellular matrix  occurs during heart failure and the matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors are involved in this process
 <cit> . initially mmp- <dig> was considered to be only expressed in peripheral inflammatory cells, but its myocardial sources could be endogenous cell types such as mast cells
 <cit> . the level of mmp <dig> is increased during left ventricular remodelling following myocardial infarction in rats
 <cit> . our study showed that the expression of mmp <dig> is increased in all study groups in comparison to healthy control dogs . moreover, these results were confirmed with real-time pcr . the study conducted by oyama and chittur revealed that the expression of timp <dig> was over  <dig> times higher in dogs with endocardiosis than in healthy dogs
 <cit> . our results  showed a similar tendency. another gene identified as heart - failure - specific one was haptoglobin . the expression of hp was higher  in diseased dogs than in control dogs. in humans the functional allelic polymorphism in the hp gene plays a key role in determining survival and presence of congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction
 <cit> . however, it seems quite impossible that single gene expression could influence the complex processes of heart disease development. rather relationships and interactions between differentially expressed genes could play a key role. in order to evaluate these possibilities we used the pathway studio software. this database gives the opportunity to find genes involved in different kinds of signalling pathways. pathway studio software can also group differentially expressed genes on the basis of their molecular function and biological processes in which they are involved. the genes differentially expressed with statistical significance identified as heart-failure-specific were involved in regulation of two canonical pathways, namely angiotensinr - > creb/elk-srf/tp <dig> signalling and ephrinr - > actin signalling. the first signalling pathway shows the relation between the expression of angiotensin receptors and creb/elk-srf/tp <dig> transcription factors and indicates that the combined activation of creb/elk-srf/tp <dig> leads to angiotensin receptor activation during the disease process. serum response factor  is a transcription factor which regulates many immediate-early genes and is required for the appearance of beating sarcomeres in the heart
 <cit> . srf activates genes involved in smooth muscle differentiation and proliferation by recruiting muscle-restricted cofactors, such as ternary complex factors  of the ets-domain family, for example elk-1
 <cit> . changed expression of elk- <dig> in peripheral blood nuclear cells in patients with refractory ischemic end-stage heart failure were also seen in our previous study
 <cit>  and kuner et al. recognized elk- <dig> as potential interaction partner necessary for creating network of regulatory genes in ischemic cardiomyopathy
 <cit> . since creb/elk-srf/tp <dig> transcription factors target angiotensin receptors in dogs with heart failure, it clearly proves that the function of the failing heart is directly correlated with renal function and that in cases of heart disease we could observe changes in the function of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. such a conclusion was also drawn from one of our previous studies in which we were able to identify that transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells in humans after acute heart failure is correlated with the creatinine  level in the blood
 <cit> .

since the lists of genes specific for each heart failure stage were much longer than the list of heart-failure-specific genes we also ran the pathway studio analysis to obtain information on significantly regulated signalling pathways in each isachc stage . while analysing these results one has to remember that isachc  <dig> heart failure stage encompasses patients without clinical signs of heart disease, isachc  <dig> stage includes dogs with compensated clinical signs and isachc  <dig> stage includes dogs with uncompensated heart failure. having this in mind one could conclude the very long list of differentially regulated genes as well as significantly regulated signalling pathways in isachc  <dig> patients is not only the results of heart disease but also the result of many different compensatory mechanisms which were triggered in order to restore homeostasis. on the other hand in isachc  <dig> patients, the majority of these mechanisms are no longer in place so the list of regulated genes and pathways is much shorter. based on our results it could be concluded that for the isachc  <dig> group, the specific changes in the transcriptome include the regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase kinase receptors, bradykinin receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptor. these changes seem to be rather unspecific for heart disease and probably reflect only the reaction of the body to progressed disease, not the progression of the disease itself. in case of isachc  <dig> specific genes and pathways the interpretation of the obtained results is complex but in our opinion it is worth to point out that in addition to the statistically significant regulation of many inflammatory pathways and growth factors, we also see changes in the regulation of transcription factors targeted at platelet-mediated mediators and ptafr . anti-platelet therapy is one of the standard approaches in the treatment of patients with heart failure in humans and the regulation of this receptor was also identified in our previous study on patients with end-stage ischemic heart failure
 <cit> . platelet-activating factor may play a critical role in the development of severe heart failure coupled with resulting multiple organ failure, as seen in the munakata et al. study performed on dogs with left ventricular assistance post coronary ligation
 <cit> . this study showed that it may also be beneficial for dogs with clinical signs of severe heart disease to receive some form of anti-platelet therapy.

in the pathways significantly regulated in isachc  <dig> patients, we were able to identify for the first time the presence of transcription factors targeting egfr/erbb <dig>  the erbb2-dependent signalling pathway is involved in proper myocardium function, structure and contractility
. the erbb <dig>  receptor is responsible for the activation of several transcription factors, including ap- <dig>  and nuclear factor kappa b 
 <cit> . it could play a key role in dilated cardiomyopathy prevention
 <cit> . in mice with erbb <dig> gene deletion a gradual development of systolic myocardial dysfunction has been observed, occurring with myocardium thinning and heart ventricles distension
 <cit> . in mice the binding of neuregulin- <dig>  to the her <dig> receptor is cardioprotective
 <cit> . since there is no data in the literature in this field obtained from dogs, we could only speculate that the regulation of erbb <dig> signalling pathway in dogs with isachc  <dig> heart failure could be the feature of end-stage heart failure also in this species. but this observation requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells in dogs with heart failure seems to reflect the presence of clinical signs of the disease in patients. such a conclusion could be drawn from the observation that the longest list of differentially expressed genes as well as signalling pathways were identified in isachc  <dig> group of patients, those first to show clinical signs of heart failure. the development of heart failure in dogs results in changed expression of genes involved in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in peripheral blood nuclear cells whereas end-stage heart failure could be reflected by activation of transcription factors targeting at the erbb <dig> receptor.
