BACKGROUND
mammals have evolved a diverse array of craniofacial morphologies in response to their specialist diets. examples of carnivores, omnivores and herbivores have evolved independently in both the placental  and marsupial  lineages  with diet placing substantial selective pressures on craniofacial evolution. while there are many key developmental genes responsible for patterning the facial skeleton, the precise mechanisms driving these morphological adaptations are not well defined  <cit> . one of the most remarkable examples of craniofacial diversity is between breeds of domestic dogs which have been subjected to strong artificial selection  <cit> . a comparative analysis of repeat variation in developmental genes associated with skeletal and craniofacial development was performed across dog breeds with diverse craniofacial phenotypes  <cit> . a strong positive correlation was observed between craniofacial length and the ratio of polyglutamines  to polyalanines  in the qa repeat domain of the runt-related transcription factor  <dig>  gene  <cit> .

runx <dig> is a transcription factor and master regulator of osteogenesis in the development of the mammalian skeleton  <cit> . runx <dig> binds the osteoblast-specific cis-acting element  within the promoter of several key skeletal genes  <cit> . mice deficient for runx <dig> are unable to develop a bony skeleton  <cit> . in humans, mutations in runx <dig> cause cleidocranial dysplasia , with individuals possessing craniofacial abnormalities with delayed closure of cranial sutures and dental anomalies  <cit> . interestingly, several of the skeletal abnormalities associated with ccd patients are characteristic of the neanderthal skeleton, and it has been hypothesized that evolutionary changes to runx <dig> played a fundamental role in the phenotypic divergence of modern humans  <cit> .

runx <dig> contains several functional domains, including a highly conserved runt dna binding domain and, central to this study, a repetitive glutamine , alanine  domain  <cit> . changes to the length, or ratio, of sequential glutamines to alanines within runx <dig> alter its transactivational activity  providing a direct link between variation within this domain and craniofacial length in dogs. amino acid coding repeats are thought to provide a fast-acting mechanism for generating evolvability. repeats promote replication slippage, resulting in expansions and contractions which can generate new alleles in rapid succession and promote variation  <cit> . the qa repeat in runx <dig> provides a mechanism by which rapid morphological variation can arise. such protein coding repeats have been described as “evolutionary tuning knobs” where small, incremental changes can be associated with rapid morphological evolution  <cit> .

selective pressures over short evolutionary timeframes may favour changes in repeat length as a mechanism to generate rapid morphological change  <cit> . this may be especially true in the domestic dogs as they represent a single species that has been subjected to intense selective breeding over the past century  <cit> . the runx <dig> qa repeat and facial length was investigated across distinct placental orders to determine if repeat evolution correlates with facial morphology in naturally evolving taxa over larger evolutionary timeframes. the qa-repeat and facial-length was recorded across the carnivorans, the order in which the dogs and other canids are phylogenetically distributed  <cit> . as seen in the domestic dogs , there was a positive correlation between the runx <dig> qa repeat length and facial length within this order, despite over  <dig> million years of evolution  <cit> . it was also noted that this correlation was stronger in members of the caniformia who exhibit allometric craniofacial development and higher overall craniofacial diversity. in addition, the runx <dig> repeat to facial length ratio was also examined across another placental order, the primates, who have been evolving for  <dig> million years  <cit> . primates, like the carnivora, display a similar positive correlation between the runx <dig> repeat and facial length  <cit> . an analysis of the runx <dig> repeat to facial length was conducted across the three extant lineages of placental mammals including the afrotheria, boreoeutheria including euarchontoglires  and laurasiatherians , and the xenartha. while a correlation could be observed between the runx <dig> repeat and facial length within specific orders, this relationship did not hold true when comparing across orders spanning the entire placental infraclass  <cit> .

together these studies show a correlation between the runx <dig> qa repeat and facial length within defined placental lineages. the modern orders of placental mammals arose ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and radiated into a diverse range of terrestrial, aquatic and aerial species  with each group displaying highly variable facial morphologies acquired along their own evolutionary trajectories. although the runx <dig> repeat may drive facial evolution within orders, other compensatory epistatic changes may act across larger evolutionary distances such that correlations cannot be detected.

all studies on runx <dig> repeat length and facial diversity have been conducted in placental mammals. however, it is unknown whether a correlation between runx <dig> repeat length and facial length exists in their sister group, the marsupials. the marsupials are a naturally evolving infraclass that split from the placental lineage ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and radiated into  <dig> orders distributed through two superorders . like their placental relatives, marsupials have evolved their own distinct range of adaptive craniofacial morphologies suited to their various specialized feeding ecologies . marsupials occupy a diverse range of facial lengths but show a reduced range of overall craniofacial diversity when compared to placental mammals . within marsupials there are also several cases of convergent craniofacial phenotypes with the placentals . the extinct thylacine and the canids represent one of the most extraordinary examples of convergence in mammals especially in their craniofacial morphology . here we test whether variation to the runx <dig> repeat can explain facial length variation between individuals throughout the various orders and families of marsupials, and across the marsupial infraclass.fig.  <dig> craniofacial diversity of marsupials and convergencemarsupials possess a diverse range of morphologies and craniofacial diversity. a fat-tailed dunnart  and b tasmanian devil  from the order dasyuromorphia. c eastern grey kangaroo , d koala  and e brushtail possum  from the order diprotodontia f. eastern barred bandicoot  from the order peramelemorphia. g monito del monte  from the order microbiotheria, and h virginian opossum  from the order didelphimorphia. panels i-l marsupials and placentals that display striking craniofacial convergence. thylacine  i order dasyuromorphia, and placental dingo  k; and the marsupial mole  , order notoryctemorphia and placental golden mole  l. all images have been reproduced with permission . m box plot showing the range of marsupial facial length ratios compared with placentals  <cit>  and carnivora  <cit> . boxes indicate the upper and lower quartiles, horizontal line inside indicates the median value. the horizontal lines indicate the extremes of the distribution with outliers shown as points




surprisingly, in contrast to the placental mammals, marsupials possess almost no variability in the runx <dig> repeat length or composition across individuals at the genus, family and order level. despite their diverse array of facial morphologies, marsupials have not utilized evolutionary changes to the runx <dig> repeat to control their facial length development.

RESULTS
marsupials display a wide range of craniofacial diversity
the marsupials display a wide range of adaptive craniofacial morphologies , corresponding to their various diets. as expected, the marsupials display a diverse range of facial lengths, which are consistent with the range of facial length ratiosobserved within members of the placentals . the majority of the marsupials displayed facial length ratios, measured as the length of the face divided by skull length , between  <dig>  and  <dig> , including all of the dasyuromorphia, diprotodontia, microbiotheria, and the didelphimorphia. the koala, being a strict folivore, displayed the shortest facial length ratio of  <dig>  while the omnivorous short-nosed southern brown bandicoot and insectivorous marsupial mole displayed longer facial length ratios between  <dig> – <dig> . the major exception was seen in the long-nosed eastern barred bandicoot, which possesses the longest face in this study with a facial length ratio of  <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of sampled marsupials and craniofacial morphologyphylogeny of marsupials used this study with selected taxa displaying a wide range of craniofacial diversity. taxa included represent  <dig> of the  <dig> marsupial orders and  <dig> families. all skull images were taken from the museum victoria mammalogy collection with permission, with the exception of the dropiciops gliroides . different colour lineage shading indicates different marsupial orders

there are several cases of morphological convergence reported between marsupials and placental mammals with the most striking examples seen between the thylacine and canids , and the marsupial and placental moles  <cit> . we compared the facial length data from the thylacine to that reported for the canids  <cit> , as well as between the marsupial mole  and the african cape golden mole . as expected the thylacine and red fox displayed extremely similar facial length ratios . the marsupial mole and golden mole also showed similar ratios .

marsupials have a highly conserved runx <dig> repeat
we determined runx <dig> repeat ratios across a broad range of marsupials  and found that remarkably there was little-to-no variation between individuals at the genus, family and order level . the majority of marsupials, specifically australidelphians within the orders peramelemorphia, dasyuromorphia and diprotodontia, show a highly-conserved repeat length consisting of 17q:22a . slight variation was seen in some members of the order diprotodontia with one less glutamine  and in the thylacine  with one less alanine . the only south american residing australidelphian, the monito del monte , had a slightly shortened 16q:19a repeat , whilst the true south american marsupials, the ameridelphian opossums  displayed the shortest marsupial repeat with 16q:18a . the largest variation in repeat length was seen in the phenotypically unique marsupial mole  with an extended glutamine tract  making it the only marsupial with a qa ratio above  <dig> .fig.  <dig> runx <dig> repeat length vs facial length ratio in marsupialstable  showing the number of q and a repeats, qa ratio and facial length  ratio across the species examined, grouped into specific orders. the runx <dig> repeat ratio shows little to no correlation with facial length ratio across marsupials at multiple taxonomic levels. marsupials possess a highly-conserved repeat length of 17q:22a, especially within the australidelphians. the american marsupials displayed a slightly shorter repeat and the marsupial mole possesses a greatly extended glutamine repeat. graph  showing facial length ratios plotted against qa ratio for all species shown in the table. coloured dots indicate specific orders as shown in the table on left. when compared to the various spectra of facial length ratios there was no clear correlation . skulls from the eastern barred bandicoot , virginian opossum  and koala  are shown to demonstrate variation in craniofacial morphology

the runx <dig> repeat is not correlated with facial length in marsupials
we found that the runx <dig> repeat is not correlated with facial length variation within orders or across the marsupials  due to its high conservation. in addition, we found no similarities in repeat length or composition between the thylacine  and the red fox  and golden mole  despite their remarkable similarities in skull morphology. these results suggest that the large degree of conservation of the runx <dig> repeat in the marsupials cannot explain their facial length diversity.

marsupials display high repeat purity
given the high level of conservation of the length of the marsupial runx <dig> repeat, we next explored the codon heterogeneity of the repeat to determine whether marsupials have evolved interruptions to their codon purity as a potential mechanism repressing repeat length variation. we found that members of the various marsupial orders possess high homology in both the repeat and flanking nucleotide sequence of runx <dig>  yet display specific polymorphisms increasing with phylogenetic distance . not only this, but marsupials have maintained a high level of codon purity, despite displaying almost no repeat length variability. we calculated repeat purity using a previously described metric of the number of perfect nucleotide matches in the canonical repeat unit divided by the total length of the repeat  <cit> . we found that marsupials possess a high purity glutamine repeat  ranging from  <dig> – <dig> , whilst the alanine repeat  ranged from  <dig> – <dig> , with the exception of the thylacine  . both repeat purities were well above the theoretical minima  <cit>  and were in line with those recorded in the placentals.

discussion
runx <dig> repeat length variation has been repeatedly correlated with craniofacial length within placental orders  <cit> . here we show that this relationship does not hold true in marsupials. surprisingly, we observed almost no variation in the runx <dig> qa repeat across the entire infraclass, preventing it from acting as a major driver of craniofacial diversity in metatherian marsupials.

marsupials display a wide range of facial length ratios, similar to that recorded in the placentals   <cit> . remarkably, after sequencing the runx <dig> repeat from  <dig> marsupial species, it was found that repeat length and composition was extremely conserved, with  <dig> of the  <dig> species examined having an invariant runx <dig> repeat of 17q:22a  . the two sampled opossums , showed a slightly shortened repeat consisting of 16q:19a . the didelphimorphia are derived from one of the most basal marsupial and south american residing lineages  <cit>  and are perhaps representative of the ancestral marsupial repeat before the divergence of the australidelphian marsupials. the monito del monte , the only south american residing australidelphian marsupial  <cit> , has a repeat length that is intermediate to the south american and australian marsupials, comprised of 16q:21a . species from the three orders that make up the majority of australian marsupials  predominantly showed a conserved 17q:22a allele . it is worth noting that the koala  and the eastern barred bandicoot  showed no difference in their runx <dig> repeat length, despite occupying opposite ends of the facial length spectrum in marsupials . the one outlier with respect to runx <dig> repeat ratio was the marsupial mole  which has an extended glutamine tract . whilst the notoryctemorphia is classed within the australidelphia, its true phylogenetic position is still disputed  <cit> . marsupial moles are highly specialized burrowers and perhaps have been under their own unique and extreme selective pressures to arrive at their highly unusual morphology and marsupial runx <dig> repeat composition. even when the marsupial mole runx <dig> repeat ratio is considered, the range of variation seen in marsupials  is minimal compared to that seen in the primates , the carnivora  and across placentals as a whole . as expected, despite their extraordinary morphological convergence and similarities in craniofacial morphology, the repeat lengths of the thylacine and red fox and the marsupial and placental moles were vastly different, likely owing to their distant divergence and genomic background.

the extreme conservation in runx <dig> qa repeat length seen across marsupials was unexpected due to the typical volatility of such sequences  <cit>  and the large amount of inter-specific and intra-specific variability seen across the placentals  <cit> . while each of the runx <dig> repeats sequenced in this study were from a single individual, the extremely low levels of variation between individuals at the genus, family and order level suggests it is highly unlikely that marsupials would possess any intra-species variability. therefore, we hypothesised that marsupials must have evolved variation in the codon usage of the qa repeat as a repressive mechanism to control replication slippage. the longer and purer the repeat, the more unstable and prone to replication error  <cit> . however, our results show that the marsupial polyglutamine, polyalanine repeat tract is of a high repeat purity  despite showing almost no length variation. the average marsupial runx <dig> glutamine repeat purity  was observed to be consistent with that observed in dogs   <cit> , primates   <cit> ) and throughout other linages of placental mammals  . the marsupial alanine repeat purity  is also similar to that found in humans , primates  and other placental mammals , but lower than that observed in domestic dogs   <cit> . whilst these values only represent purity at a single locus, they are also in line with observed genomic repeat purity in the various families of the carnivora  <cit> . given that both the marsupials and placentals show highly similar runx <dig> repeat purities, yet the marsupials possess little to no length variation, our data suggests that marsupials must have evolved other mechanisms to repress runx <dig> repeat mutation and slippage events as a means to maintain repeat length integrity.

the conservation of the runx <dig> repeat length in marsupials suggests that there is strong evolutionary constraint on its function. marsupial development is unique in that the young are born in a highly altricial state, yet display accelerated anterior skeletal development  <cit> . marsupial neonates display accelerated development and ossification of the shoulder girdle and forelimbs for climbing into the pouch  <cit> . in addition, they require accelerated development of the facial skeleton, particularly ossification of the upper and lower jaw, to enable attachment to the teat and sucking  <cit> . owing to this mode of development it has been hypothesized that marsupials are subjected to strong developmental constraints, resulting in limitations to their ontogenic flexibility in skeletal development and a severe reduction to their adult craniofacial morphological diversity  <cit> . given that runx <dig> is a major regulator of osteogenesis and skeletal development, any major alterations of the repeat leading to changes in its expression and transactivation  or timing of ossification of the core skeletal elements may be pleiotropic and negatively selected against. we suggest that purifying selection has maintained the runx <dig> repeat throughout marsupial evolution as a mechanism to maintain their constrained skeletal development.

CONCLUSIONS
together our data have shown that runx <dig> repeat length is highly conserved across the marsupials both in repeat length and sequence composition. these data discount runx <dig> qa repeat length variation as a driver of craniofacial diversity in marsupials unlike in placental mammals. furthermore, runx <dig> repeat length is not correlated with convergent phenotypes between placental and marsupial species. therefore, marsupials must have evolved other mechanisms to drive facial length diversity. the unprecedented degree of repeat conservation across the marsupials implies strong purifying selection to maintain a stable allele. we propose that the extreme conservation in repeat length is constrained by the early ossification of the anterior skeleton to enable climbing and suckling of the altricial marsupial young.
