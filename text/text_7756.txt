BACKGROUND
conifers represent an ancient and widespread lineage of about  <dig> species  <cit> . they are of immense ecological and economic importance as they dominate many terrestrial landscapes and are primarily used for timber and paper production worldwide. domestication of some of these species started in the mid 1950ies with mass selection of outstanding genotypes in natural forests  <cit> . genetic improvement programs resulted in advances in biomass production, wood quality and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. however, traditional breeding has remained a slow process because of long generation intervals and because most traits cannot be correctly evaluated at an early developmental stage. the application of genomic techniques in crop  <cit>  and animal  <cit>  breeding has resulted in more powerful methods for genetic evaluation, and recent advances in conifer genomics  <cit>  have allowed tree breeders to use these tools and methodologies  to dissect the genetic basis of phenotypic variability and to accelerate the breeding process of these long-lived organisms  <cit> .

knowledge about linkage disequilibrium  measured by the squared correlation between two loci is important for applications of molecular markers in association mapping and genomic prediction. the decay of ld over physical and genetic distance determines the resolution and density of the markers required for association mapping  <cit> . a formal link between the power of association tests and ld was established  <cit> , and has recently been generalized for structured populations with related genotypes  <cit> . ld also determines the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values  <cit> . indeed, the direct and inverse relationship between expected ld  and population recombination rate ) has obvious consequences for genomic prediction, because both the training population size and marker density vary with ne, the effective population size  <cit> .

previous studies of short-distance  ld in conifers, including maritime pine  <cit> , have shown that ld extends to only a few hundred to a few thousand base pairs , but with considerable variation between genes  <cit> . these results have led to the conclusion that millions of snps would be required for very high resolution of whole-genome scan association mapping approaches for forest trees,. thus candidate gene-based approaches have been favored and may prove the best option before sufficiently larger numbers of markers, covering the whole genome, become available  <cit>  as recently illustrated for fruit and forest trees  <cit> , including maritime pine  <cit> . considering about  <dig> thousand genes, with an average gene size of 3– <dig>  kb, pavy et al.  <cit>  estimated that a total of  <dig> – <dig>  million snps would be required to cover the gene space of spruce at a rate of one snp per 85 bp, which may in any case correspond to only a tiny fraction of the megagenome of this species. only a few studies have examined the extent and genome-wide distribution of ld in conifers. using physical information from three random bac clones, moritsuka et al.  <cit>  reported significant ld  in non coding regions of the cryptomeria japonica genome, suggesting that recombination rate may vary according to the nature  of dna, as shown in angiosperms  <cit>  and gymnosperms  <cit> . in the same species, tsumura et al.  <cit>  discovered that some loci showing divergence along environmental gradients and located in different linkage groups, displayed substantial ld, suggesting an effect of epistatic selection between these loci. to our knowledge, only one study in pinus taeda <cit>  reported ld for  <dig> mapped snps and confirmed the assumption of independence between genetically linked loci. this study showed that only a handful of loci departed from this expectation, five of which were cosegregating loci displaying a high degree of differentiation between populations. this pattern was attributed to the presence of a ‘genomic island’ of differentiation.

the main objective of this paper was to describe ld pattern, level and structure of genetic diversity across the maritime pine genome. the result may provide baseline information for future genetic studies  in this economically important conifer. to this end, we first establish a high-density genetic linkage map by merging three existing snp-based maps  <cit>  using map merging approaches implemented in the software lpmerge  <cit>  and mergemap  <cit> . then, a set of unrelated individuals in the first stage of domestication was genotyped with the mapped markers to describe the genome-wide history of recombination and estimate the level and structure of genetic diversity in this first generation breeding population. based on knowledge on other forest tree species, we would expect high levels of genetic diversity, a lack of extended ld and limited population structure  <cit> , whereas the applied mass selection might be expected to have decreased diversity around the loci underlying the selected target traits  <cit> . all of these effects would have important implications for association mapping  <cit>  and genomic prediction in breeding  <cit> .

RESULTS
construction of a composite linkage map for maritime pine and distribution of recombination on chromosomes
we used the following strategy to integrate the three linkage maps, g2f, g2m and f <dig>  into a single composite map. first, intermediate composite maps were established for g2f-f <dig> and g2m-f <dig> because there were few markers common to the g2f and g2m maps suitable for anchoring , whereas  <dig> snps were common to f <dig> and g2f maps and  <dig> snps were common to f <dig> and g2m maps . we then calculated a final composite map from these two intermediate maps. it comprised  <dig>  snps  distributed along  <dig> lgs , with a minimum of  <dig> markers in lg <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> markers in lg <dig>  with lpmerge software, the  <dig> composite lgs covered a distance of  <dig>  cm, with individual lg lengths ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> cm , and a density of  <dig> snp marker per  <dig>  cm . with mergemap software, the lgs covered  <dig> . <dig> cm, with a individual lg length ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> cm  and a density of  <dig> snp per cm.

we compared the results generated by lpmerge and mergemap methods, by carrying out wilcoxon signed rank tests on two metrics: the linkage group length of the composite map, and the root mean square error  calculated from the difference in map position , between each component map and the resulting composite map. three hypotheses were tested: i) the map lengths obtained for the intermediate  composite maps do not differ significantly between lpmerge and mergemap; ii) the difference in rmse between component  maps and the resulting intermediate  composite map does not differ significantly between lpmerge and mergemap, and iii) the rmse for each component  map does not differ significantly from the intermediate  composite map constructed with lpmerge, and similarly for mergemap. mergemap systematically yielded longer maps than lpmerge, for both intermediate and final composite maps . rmses were determined for each linkage group after the map merging process. comparisons between the two programs showed that mergemap gave larger rmses than lpmerge  for intermediate composite maps, but that rmses were similar for the two programs after the final step of map merging . despite these differences, marker order was highly correlated , for all lgs, between the composite maps constructed with lpmerge and mergemap. finally, correlations between marker positions on parental maps  and on the final composite map constructed with lpmerge were high , indicating that the positions of the markers on the composite map were consistent with those on the corresponding source maps.

a chi2-test  was performed on the composite map, to determine whether genes were evenly distributed between maritime pine chromosomes. with twice as many markers than in our first investigation  <cit>  it was clear that the number of markers per lg did not deviate significantly from a uniform distribution over the  <dig> linkage groups . in terms of the distribution of markers on individual chromosomes, we found that a density of at least  <dig> markers per bandwidth  was required for the identification of a recombination cold spot, whereas a density of at most three markers  characterized a hot spot for recombination. given these upper and lower limits, and considering the stringent confidence interval defined for kernel density function, we identified  <dig> significant clusters of markers , corresponding to recombination cold spots . it proved more difficult to identify significant hot spots of recombination . as reported in  <cit> , hot spots are more genetically variable, and it is therefore more difficult to detect them on a composite map maximizing the number of recombination events from individual crosses. examination of the shape of the kernel density estimate revealed that seven linkage groups  had three clear peaks, with locations consistent with the centromeric and telomeric regions. compared to the study by chancerel et al.  <cit>  more rigorous statistical testing  certainly contributed to discard a number of false positives. however, one should not forget that the distribution of recombination is genetically variable, therefore by merging information from different genetic maps it is likely that only stable hot and cold spots across the studied genetic backgrounds were revealed.

snp-assay genotyping statistics for the first-generation breeding  population
the mean call rate  was 92% for the fgb population. two poorly performing samples were identified by plotting the sample call rate against the 10% genecall score. three pairs of trees were found to display identical genotypic information for the  <dig>  snps and were therefore considered mislabeled in the tree archive . all six trees were discarded. this left  <dig> trees for the analysis of population genetics parameters. in total,  <dig>  snps were polymorphic , corresponding to  <dig>  contigs of the maritime pine unigene . we positioned  <dig>  of these snps, corresponding to  <dig>  different loci, on the composite map. the overall conversion rate  was therefore 28%. in total,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  “failed” assays corresponded to snps and  <dig> to indels, whereas  <dig>  of the  <dig>  monomorphic loci corresponded to snps and  <dig>  corresponded to indels. this increased the conversion rate to  <dig> % for snps and decreased the rate for indels to  <dig> %, indicating that indels should be avoided when designing an infinium assay. a list of polymorphic snps is available from the ncbi dbsnp database  and is also provided in additional file  <dig> 

test for hardy–weinberg equilibrium, distribution of minor allele frequency and population structure analysis
significant departure from hardy-weinberg equilibrium was detected for  <dig> snps from the  <dig>  polymorphic markers in the fgb population . after bonferroni correction for multiple tests  none of these snps yielded a value significantly different from the expected value. we can therefore consider that the percentages of each of the three snp genotypes remained constant in what can be considered a large population, with random mating, without mutation, migration or natural selection. the minor allele frequency  distribution of these  <dig>  snps is shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> snps presented a maf<5%. the scatter plots of these rare snp alleles were checked visually, one-by-one, with genomestudio genotyping software. in all cases, the clustering profile was confirmed. this distribution is unlikely to reflect the true maf distribution for snps in the studied population. indeed, as pointed out in  <cit> , in silico snp detection based on the use of sequenced cdna libraries introduces an ascertainment bias toward genes that are strongly expressed  and, probably, less polymorphic, due to the stringent cutoffs used: i) maf≥33% and coverage≥10×, to prevent the selection of snps present at such low frequencies that they are likely to be the product of sequencing error, ii) adt score ≥  <dig> , to minimize the variability of the flanking region surrounding the targeted snp, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful illumina infinium assay. in addition, the maf spectrum is likely to be shifted upward, with an underrepresentation of rare alleles not captured due to the small size of the sample used to prepare the cdna libraries. the possibility of such a bias should be borne in mind when making further evolutionary inferences concerning the demographic and selective history of maritime pine populations.

population structure and relatedness between individuals are known to bias the estimation of ld  <cit> . in this study, the trees of the fgb population were selected from natural stands in the landes forest, with a sampling method designed to ensure the sampling of unrelated individuals. the observed patterns of pairwise relatedness  suggests that this objective was achieved. we tested for possible cryptic relatedness or differentiation, by performing principal component analysis  on the full genotype matrix of  <dig>  snps. a comparison of the size of the eigenvalues obtained with the tracy-widom distribution yielded two significant principal components. in theory, this could indicate the presence of three distinct subpopulations, clustering on the basis of the first two pcs yielded three groups with very low levels of genetic differentiation . we plotted these individuals along the two significant pcs and found little evidence of separate clusters . geographic analysis reveals a significant relationship  between genetic pc <dig> and the major axis of geographic variation , with some evidence of pc <dig> being associated with the second axis   . overall, there was a weak, but significant pattern of isolation by distance   rather than a division into distinct groups. this result was confirmed by the structure analysis performed with structure software . in this analysis, the values of mean likelihood obtained for the one- to ten-group models tested did not reach a plateau and evanno’s delta k criterion did not identify a peak for any of the k values tested. moreover, for k values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the entire set of  <dig> individuals was found to be admixed, with none being identified as a full member of a specific group. these patterns are typical of an unstructured population  <cit>  and indicate the absence of a particular genetic structure at the scale of the fgb population.

spatial analysis of genetic diversity on chromosomes
the mean value of nei’s diversity index  calculated for the  <dig>  snps was  <dig>  , while that for the  <dig>  snps corresponding to mapped contigs was  <dig> , . these are very high estimates given the biallelic nature of these markers . we used the mapped markers to determine whether genetic diversity was equally distributed between the lgs . a significant difference  between he values was observed. tukey’s hsd test showed that lgs could be classified into three groups, with lower , medium  and higher  levels of diversity.

we then used a spatial statistics approach to determine whether the genetic diversity of the mapped markers was distributed non-uniformly along the chromosomes. we estimated the empirical variogram of h
e
 , to determine whether neighboring genes on the chromosome presented similar patterns of diversity. a spatially structured process would show an increase in variance with increasing map distance between markers. based on all the gene loci from the composite map and map distances ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cm, we found no particular relationship between γ^h and gene position on the composite map. most of the calculated empirical variances fell within the area predicted by permutation . this was true for the individual lgs of the composite map and was confirmed for the component maps as well . thus, diversity at neighboring gene loci was not correlated with recombination distances in the study population and, with the marker density used, there is little evidence for extended reductions in diversity due to selective sweeps. given this result, we did not attempt to krige our data to detect hot or cold spots of diversity at a centimorgan scale.

extent of intra- and inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium
at least two snps were available in  <dig> est-contigs for investigation of the pattern of physical ld. we considered snps with a maf>5%, resulting in the retention of  <dig> pairs for the analysis. however, given the biased procedure used to select snps in silico, the biased representation of polymorphic sites within these contigs and the skewed distribution of distances between sites , the observed pattern of short-distance ld  was not consistent with trends typically observed in conifers  <cit>  based on amplicon sequencing. in addition, the estimate of the population experimental parameter  was negative, precluding any use of this data set for the further interpretation of physical ld over short distances.

the pattern of long-distance  ld was examined for the first time in this species, over the  <dig> chromosomes, on the basis of snp markers localized on the composite linkage map and their genotypic profiles in an unstructured population. the distribution of the squared correlation coefficient for allelic frequencies  showed that ld decreased rapidly over very short genetic distances for all chromosomes . however, we also identified  <dig> pairs  for which the r <dig> was above the  <dig>  critical level, while the genetic distance was different from  <dig> in the composite map. in order to verify whether these possible long distance ld  were not due to inaccurate map position resulting from the construction of the composite linkage map, we directly checked the map position of these pairs in the components maps. from these  <dig> pairs,  <dig> originated from the same component map, while  <dig> were from different component maps. from these  <dig> pairs, the genetic distance in the component map was equal to  <dig> cm for  <dig> pairs and comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> cm for  <dig> pairs, indicating that their position in the r <dig> plot was probably unreliable and therefore could not be used to infer long distance ld. an extreme case is provided for two outliers markers  in lg <dig> placed  <dig> cm apart in the composite map, while they completely co-segregated in the component map . thus, only  <dig> pairs  were left to construct the distribution of long distance  ld. as rare allele frequency can influence ld, this distribution  was drawn based on  <dig> pairs  from which both markers had a maf >20%. in cases where a functional annotation was available, there was no similarity between a marker pair suggesting that these snps belonged to different genes rather than to different contigs of the same gene. in addition,  <dig> cases  of such possible long distance ld could be confirmed by the fact that intragenic snps presented similar r <dig> values with snps in another gene. finally, this distribution was used as a null model to test the significance of inter-chromosomal ld . each inter-chromosomal ld value was tested against the upper bound of this null distribution . given the number of tests performed, bonferroni correction was applied to this upper bound . no significant inter-chromosomal ld was found in this population.

discussion
development of a composite map for maritime pine and genome-wide distribution of recombination
advances in next-generation sequencing and array-based genotyping technologies have lowered development times and costs for reliable single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers  <cit> . the availability of such markers has been a boon for the generation of high-density linkage maps in model and non model plant species, as recently demonstrated in sunflower  <cit> , barley  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . the integration of information from multiple linkage maps for hundreds to thousands of markers is another challenge. one approach to the integration of information for multiple populations is to pool the genotypic data and minimize the sum of recombination frequencies , as in the maximum likelihood method  <cit>  applied to single populations, e.g.  <cit> . however, the computational time required for this approach may be prohibitive in some situations  <cit>  and this method is unworkable when genotypic data are unavailable. an alternative strategy involves integrating the linkage maps for separate populations without analyzing their genotypic data. yap et al. <cit>  were the first to model a map as a directed graph, with nodes representing mapped markers and edges defining the order of adjacent markers. they also designed an algorithm for merging maps from different studies on the basis of loci common to different maps. wu et al. <cit>  subsequently developed an algorithm based on graph theory implemented in mergemap, a program that has been used to construct several composite maps for barley  <cit> . endelman  <cit>  discovered that the graph linearization technique used by mergemap was suboptimal and proposed a new approach to overcome this problem through linear programming. however, the software developed by endelman  <cit> , dagger, was unable to merge linkage maps with ordering conflicts. lpmerge, used for the first time on empirical data in the present paper, was designed to resolve ordering conflicts between component linkage maps and minimize errors between the composite map and the component maps  <cit> . by using this software we generated a composite map consisting of  <dig>  snp markers distributed over  <dig> lgs, covering  <dig>  cm. map length was similar to that obtained for maps constructed with similar numbers of loci in other conifer species:  <dig>  cm in picea glauca with  <dig>  loci  <cit> ,  <dig> cm with  <dig>  loci in pinus taeda <cit> . we then used this map to investigate the genome-wide distribution of recombination. we found clear peaks for the number of markers. their locations was consistent with centromeric and telomeric regions, in agreement with previous findings in other species with a similar genome size such wheat, reporting that recombination was limited in these regions  <cit> .

level and genome-wide distribution of genetic diversity in the first breeding population of maritime pine
we presented a genome-wide map of genetic diversity  for a population resulting from mass selection in natural forests, with an estimated selection intensity of about  <dig>  × 10- <dig> <cit> . this population provided us a unique opportunity to study the effect of the first stage of domestication on the level and distribution of genetic diversity in a highly heterozygous forest tree species. we showed that a selection intensity of this magnitude did not decrease the overall level of genetic diversity.

our findings are consistent with those of previous studies carried out with an handful of allozyme markers in breeding populations of douglas fir  <cit>  and sitka spruce  <cit> , and with a recent investigation based on snp markers spanning the entire genetic map of white spruce  <cit> , showing no decrease in genetic variation during the first stage of domestication of these highly polymorphic species. we can therefore conclude that mass selection applied at a regional scale , even with very high intensity, did not appear to compromise the background neutral genetic diversity of the maritime pine base breeding population. thus, the high level of genetic diversity found in the fgb population is consistent with a large randomly mating population, as typically found for outcrossing species.

we found no significant spatial pattern of genetic diversity in the maritime pine genome . such patterns would have been indicative of decreases in diversity associated with loci underlying the variation of the target traits. however, given the rapid decay of ld in this species , the marker density used was probably too low to capture any localized decline in heterozygosity, if any occurred around selected loci.

these results contrast with the large reduction of genetic variability observed for the selected traits  <cit>  between the landes natural forest and the base population of the breeding program , particularly for growth. we can therefore conclude that these markers are probably not functionally important with respect to these selection criteria, in agreement with the lack of statistical association between allelic variation and breeding values for height growth and stem straightness . further investigations will be required to identify snps in ld with target trait-qtls. such investigations could involve the genotyping of unselected trees from wild populations and the comparison of allele frequencies before and after mass selection, or tests of association between breeding values and marker genotypes, as illustrated in  <cit>  for white spruce. given the polygenic basis of complex traits subjected to breeding, such as height and radial growth  <cit> , we anticipate that this second approach is likely to be successful only for well chosen candidate genes putatively involved in trait variation.

the set of  <dig>  snp markers developed in this study will be used to assess genetic diversity in subsequent generations of the maritime pine breeding program. the maintenance of genetic diversity is not only essential to guarantee the adaptation of future improved varieties to ongoing climatic change  <cit> , it is also of particular importance for plant breeding programs based on recurrent selection, because the progress of selection is determined by the level of genetic variation within the population.

long distance ld pattern and consequences for association mapping and genomic prediction in maritime pine
we scored  <dig>  snps in a population of  <dig> unrelated trees selected on the basis of their performance in natural forests of the aquitaine region in southwestern france, for establishment of the first generation of the maritime pine breeding program. markers for which intra-chromosomal ld was estimated covered the whole linkage map of this species, at a mean density of  <dig> marker per  <dig>  cm . sampled genes were well distributed across the  <dig> lgs of the composite map, with 78– <dig> genes per lg. as expected, high values of r <dig> were obtained only for physically linked polymorphisms, i.e. snps belonging to the same gene. no significant ld was found over larger distances. these results are consistent with population genetics theory for such an undomesticated, outcrossing species, and can be attributed principally to the large effective sizes of the unstructured populations found in most conifers . similarly, no significant epistatic ld was found between unlinked loci localized on different chromosomes. ld is a property of a given gene pool, but the convergence of our results with those of eckert et al. <cit>  for pinus taeda suggests a lack of ld between genetically spaced gene-based markers in conifer species characterized by the same type of reproductive regime and life history traits.

our findings suggest that the initial mass selection used to form the base population of the maritime pine breeding program was not only successful in terms of the initiation of a program to develop improved varieties  <cit> , but also efficient for the sampling of neutral genetic diversity from the landes forest. absence of inbreeding and cryptic population structure within the base population were also confirmed. the substantial level of polymorphism detected in the fgb population renders our set of markers as a valuable tool for breeding applications. trees have long generation interval and breeding is therefore a slow process. the  <dig>  snps developed in this study will be extended to test the utility of genomic selection  approaches to reduce the breeding cycles of maritime pine, as suggested for pinus taeda <cit> . then, favorable combinations of polymorphisms will be sought in manageable breeding populations with small effective sizes to trace qtls by linked markers. the prospective of developing gs holds great promise to increase the genetic gain in traits of interest in these long-lived organisms and to accelerate their domestication  <cit> , while maintaining sufficiently high levels of genetic diversity to allow the selected trees to cope with major biotic and abiotic disturbances.

given the lack of ld in this population and lack of associations between markers and phenotypes, predictions based on snp markers for selection would likely have very low reliability. in several simulation studies on domestic animal and trees, ld showed a significant effect on reliability of predictions from genomic prediction models  <cit> . for example, in cattle breeding, for genomic selection to be successful the level of ld was suggested to be greater than  <dig>   <cit> . when ld among the markers increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the reliability of genomic predictions increased by  <dig>    <cit> . ld is population specific and is expected to change with recombination, genetic background of the population and effective population size. to exploit marker-tagged qtl-trait associations in gs, we are currently combining three-generation pedigrees of maritime pine , where ld should be much higher compared to the base population.

CONCLUSIONS
we established a  <dig>  cm linkage map of maritime pine with  <dig>  snp markers using for the first time a new map merging algorithm that integrates linkage maps from separate populations without any recourse to original genotypic data. we found clear cold spots of recombination consistent with the centromeric and telomeric regions of metacentric chromosomes  <cit> . we then used an extended set of  <dig>  snp markers to describe historical recombination, genetic diversity and genetic structure within a mass-selected population of  <dig> unrelated genotypes. the genetic structure of this population was very weak and we found no evidence that artificial selection had decreased neutral genetic diversity. considering the map position of  <dig>  of these  <dig>  markers  we found that ld mostly extend over short physical distances as expected for an outcrossing species with large effective population size.

at the dawn of a new paradigm in forest tree breeding  <cit> , namely the implementation of gs  <cit> , a range of factors that influences the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values needs to be carefully considered, including the heritability of the traits, its genetic architecture, the extent of genotype by environment interaction, the genetic structure and the effective size of the targeted population, the number of records in the reference population, the number of markers and their associated cost, and the overall prediction and validation strategy. the present study provides novel results that should be taken into account for the implementation of gs in maritime pine. the drop in the status number  from several hundred in the mass-selected population, to  <dig> in the second breeding population and  <dig> in the elite population of the new sub-line structure of the breeding population  is a favorable situation for its further development in this species.
