BACKGROUND
preeclampsia is a pregnancy related disease associated with hypertension, proteinuria and increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, without known underlying mechanism and preventive treatment 
 <cit> . on the other hand, the future health or possible risks of women with previous history of preeclampsia are important areas of investigation. in this direction, it is well known the increased risk of future cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction, however, other risks are also being discussed 
 <cit> . owing to the morbidity and mortality of this pregnancy related disease and the possible multifactorial causes involved 
 <cit> , several experimental procedures have been applied by researchers in the last two decades, evidently, generating an elevated number of unprocessed information.

although some bioinformatic analysis has been performed in particular microarray assays 
 <cit> , an extensive data evaluation and processing has not yet been performed. furthermore, the capabilities of bioinformatics tools for gene prioritization, network analysis, gene ontology and gene-disease relationships 
 <cit> , together with all available data on protein/gene expression during preeclampsia bring an interesting and valuable opportunity for an in-silico study of the disease. therefore, the present study is focused on two main areas: i) collection and basic analysis of the genes/proteins-diseases dataset, including, protein-protein interaction network and pathway enrichment analysis and ii) exploration of the related gene-diseases in order to evaluate other genetic diseases possibly related with preeclampsia.

RESULTS
protein-protein interaction network analysis
preeclampsia ppi network topology reveals  a similar behavior with respect to general topology of ppi following a power law behavior 
 <cit>  and therefore scale-free properties. these types of networks have the particular feature that some nodes are highly connected compared with others on the same network. these highly connected nodes  in general, represent important proteins/genes in biological terms and therefore are treated with special attention.

the top  <dig> genes with high scores and also present in the initial set  are shown in table 
 <dig>  however, other genes were found with high scores value but there are not part of the initial gene group. as expected some of the selected genes like fn <dig>  flt <dig>  f <dig>  vegfa, pgf, tnf, nos and inhba, are well known preeclampsia relates genes  and several of them are related with signaling pathways.

the table shown the first  <dig> genes selected according to the score values and arranged in descendent order. we also provide the gene symbol the associated entrez gene identifier.

notes: 1) entrez gene id.

a total of  <dig> communities  covering  <dig> genes were identified by communality analysis. in figure 
 <dig>  we represent those communities that are superimposed to form a large connected graph. the genes involved in communities overlapping are also highly represented in the table 
 <dig> . the model based clustering analysis reveal an optimal number of  <dig> clusters  with an ellipsoidal distribution with equal volume, shape and variable orientation. the genes are grouped in the clusters  as follow: c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig>  and c <dig> . the c <dig> and c <dig> correspond with the highest mean scoring value:  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, and contain all the  <dig> genes with highest score values . furthermore,  <dig> genes of c <dig> are also the same genes detected in the communality analysis.

gene ontology  enrichment analyses were performed in all obtained clusters. however, for simplicity only c <dig> and c <dig> are presented . the go analysis reveals that c <dig> comprise several processes related with angiogenesis, apoptosis and cell proliferation and also shared with c <dig> several processess involved in cell activation and biological adhesion. the relation between these processes as well as the fact that both groups are representative of the highest scored genes could indicate a particular relevance of the clusters in terms of genes-disease relationship. on the other hand, also these processes are well known involved in preeclampsia and are also consistent with the pathway enrichment analysis.

diseases and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis
several types of diseases were found statistically significant in the enrichment analysis; partial results are presented in table 
 <dig>  obviously, preeclampsia and even hypertension have to be present in the analysis. in the gad database there are several disease classes and beside the presented in table 
 <dig>  others like hematologic  and renal diseases  were also significant. even when we present only the results obtained with gad database, analysis was also performed with omin database confirming the ovarian cancer  and also indicating colorectal cancer as statistically significant , however, better results were obtained with gad and also more consistent with literature information and pathway enrichment analysis.

the table provides the p-value obtained from disease enrichment analysis according to the disease class and also the sub-classes diseases following the gad database structure. the results showed are partials as discussed in the respective section.

it is important to consider that several genes in the ppi network do not present a known relation with specific diseases, at least reported in the gad or omin databases. only around 30% of the  <dig> genes were found in the databases. this difficulty means that we have to be cautious with the preeclampsia genes-diseases relationships and with the reliability of the statistical p-value, even when some important and significant inferences, can be made.

a similar situation occurred with the pathway enrichment analysis . even when the kegg database is the most representative of our gene space and high coherence was noticed with the physiopathology of pe, the results only cover around 50% of the initial  <dig> genes. a similar procedure was also performed with the reactome and biocarta databases with a less covering  and showing a high coherence with table 
 <dig> results. these databases reveal other significant pathways like ngf, pdgf, bmp, epo and egfr signaling as well as apoptosis and hemostasis pathways . some cancerous pathways  were also found statistically significant in kegg but were excluded from table 
 <dig>  in order to simplify, because many of them have similar reactions with the general cancer pathway, already presented in the table 
 <dig> 

the table provides the p-value obtained from pathway enrichment analysis in the kegg database. the pathways names correspond with the kegg nomenclature. the results showed are partials as discussed in the respective section.

in order to simplify and enhance the understanding of the involved pathways and their relationship with the selected hubs, a fusion between both was made . however, it is important to exalt that from the  <dig> hubs previously selected; only  <dig> present some significant pathway association with table 
 <dig>  the genes: ndrg <dig>  lgals3bp, banf <dig>  sgta, trim <dig>  rgs <dig>  plec, grn, st <dig>  akap <dig>  fstl <dig>  dst, pkia, qki, mlf <dig> and krt <dig>  for example, were not found in the kegg database.

discussion
ppi analysis
the top  <dig> genes selected were manually analyzed with the scientific literature in order to validate its connection with pe or even changes during pregnancy and we corroborate that several of them like flt <dig>  flt <dig>  vegfa, pgf, tnf, fn <dig>  f <dig> and nos <dig> can be related to the main lines of research in preeclampsia pathogenesis hypothesis and specially angiogenesis 
 <cit> . moreover, pgf, inhba and related inhibin as well as activin proteins have been considered in several predictive model of pe 
 <cit> . the presence of those genes in our selection could validate the method applied and increase our confidence with respect to those genes that are poorly explored or unknown in their association with preeclampsia. in the latter group, we have for example the genes lyn, pdia <dig>  ndrg <dig> and tbk <dig>  the pdia <dig> genes encode an endoplasmic protein highly related with folding processes and in its relation with pregnancy only one article was found 
 <cit>  revealing that pdia <dig> gene intervene in trophoblast invasion via interleukin   <dig>  similarly, tbk <dig> could also intervene during the first moments of pregnancy to secure the implantation in relation with the nuclear factor kappa b 
 <cit> . however, there are not articles of pdia <dig>  tbk <dig> or lyn related with preeclampsia. moreover, only one article was found describing an increased expression of ndrg <dig> during preeclampsia 
 <cit> . a similar problem is found with other genes such as iqgap <dig>  dnm <dig>  sat <dig>  men <dig> and sh2b <dig> that also have been little explored during pregnancy.

cluster analysis indicates that mainly c <dig> but also c <dig> probably embrace the most significant genes, at least related with centrality. all genes highest scored are part of these clusters as well as the large community graph and as we can notice the genes that lead to a community superposition are also highly scored in table 
 <dig> . on the other hand there are other genes like eng, vegfb and inha that are well known related to preeclampsia and are also part of the c <dig> cluster 
 <cit> . it is important to notice that there are other genes not shown in table 
 <dig> because were not present in the initial gene set. in this group, egfr and grb <dig>  are both with highest scores and there are both well related with preeclampsia 
 <cit> . thus, even when the work presented focused on the analysis of the initial group, it is possible that relevant genes were identified by ppi topology but not included in the initial subset. moreover, the go enrichment analysis clearly reveals that c <dig> and c <dig> clusters are related with angiogenesis, apoptosis and biological adhesion, which are also biological processes obtained with the pathways enrichment analysis. angiogenesis and related processes  are considered as central processes related to preeclampsia 
 <cit>  and therefore it could support the reliability of the procedure and also the necessity to increase the study of the c <dig> and c <dig> genes.

future combination of centrality indexes and specific clusters selection together with machine learning procedures or genetic algorithm optimization based on groups differentiability or external prediction subset, could reduce even more the final gene space and we are currently working in this direction.

diseases and pathway analysis
we manually evaluate through scientific literature the connection of pe with the identified metabolic pathways and diseases. the relationship between preeclampsia and inflammatory, immunologic, angiogenic and hemodynamic responses are very well documented 
 <cit>  and therefore are expected not only in the gene space but also in the metabolic pathways analysis. the metabolic pathway analysis  indicates a strong significance of the cancer pathway that is consistent with the disease analysis  and also with the vegf signaling, that is present in several related processes like cytokine-cytokine receptor, angiogenesis and also cancer pathway. with the procedure carried out in the present study a simplification of the metabolic pathways was possible, however, more needs to be done in this area in order to better integrate not only the hubs genes but also the comprehensive data created by the ppi interaction.

considering the associated metabolic pathways we can notice that several signaling pathways are statistically significant and some of them are connected with pik3cb, lyn and linked in several cases with tnf  that is a central gene affecting several processes and also widely studied in its relation with preeclampsia 
 <cit> . similarly, sh2b <dig> that encodes an adapter protein of several tyrosine kinase receptors is also connected with metabolic pathways indirectly related with apoptosis. contrasting pdia <dig> and ndrg <dig> are not present in the figure 
 <dig> connected with any metabolic pathway, but the recent relation found between pdia <dig> and il <dig> could open a relationship with cytokine-cytokine receptors 
 <cit> , specifically through the hematopoietins receptor family. we can also notice  that in the pathways associated with central proteins , those highly connected are the cytokine-cytokine receptors, focal adhesion and apoptosis pathways and they contain almost the complete space of genes mainly studied in preeclampsia.

the elevated number of signaling pathways that we found statistically significant, together with the hubs distribution detected in table 
 <dig>  seems to point out the idea of a signaling related disease similar to cancer, however, the apoptosis and angiogenic mechanism had been related previously with pe and are also highly represented in our study.

on the other hand, the relationship between pe and cardiovascular diseases is well known. women with previous history of pe or even pregnancy hypertension present an increased risk of future development of cardiovascular disease or hypertension 
 <cit> . this is clearly expressed in our results . moreover, our results also suggest a significant relationship between cancer and pe  indicated by diseases enrichment analysis and also by the metabolic pathways. however, the experimental and epidemiological evidence that could support the influence of pe in future cancer development is for now inconclusive, even when could be reasonably expected by the wide kind of genes that are actually shared between both diseases . several articles report a reduced risk of future cancer development in women with previous history of pe, but others could not find any statistical relationship 
 <cit> .

there are neither clinical signs in common between pe and alzheimer and nor epidemiological studies. however, the connection between both diseases has been questioned before  
 <cit>  and was significant in the present study. therefore, although it is not possible to validate our findings experimentally with the current information, it actually opens new possibilities for future works. a similar problem concerns to other ageing related factors like atherosclerosis, arthritis or longevity .

the present study points out several advantages of the bioinformatics analysis but some limitations were also found. the detection of genes that are very well known to be involved in pe thought the applied methodology as well as the consistence of the results across metabolic information could support the novel candidates found, however, it is necessary to reduce even more the genes space applying other methodologies as well as to design new experimental experiences. on the other hand, the limitation of the human protein interaction information suggests that also orthologous genes should be needed in order to increase the ppi covering of the initial dataset and to increase the capabilities of the metabolic pathways and disease enrichment analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we applied several bioinformatics tools in order to create a comprehensive initial database of genes statistically related to preeclampsia and a further expansion through the construction of related protein-protein interaction network. using several centrality indexes for hubs detection, some well know preeclampsia related genes like flt <dig>  tnf, vegfa and pgf were detected as well as other genes with high scores, like pdia <dig>  ndrg <dig>  tbk <dig>  lyn, iqgap <dig>  dnm <dig>  sat <dig>  men <dig> and sh2b <dig> that have been poorly explored or unknown in the current state of the art of preeclampsia physiopathology.

through disease enrichment analysis we corroborated the well know connection between pe and cardiovascular disease, but we also found a possible link of pe with aging and cancer. moreover we also found the cancer pathway, focal adhesion, ecm-receptor interaction, apoptosis and cytokine-cytokine receptors interactions metabolic pathways highly represented by the ppi network that are in agreement with some of the preeclampsia-diseases relationship found, as well as with the central topics of the current preeclampsia investigations.
