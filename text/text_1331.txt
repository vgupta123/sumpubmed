BACKGROUND
one out of  <dig> women will develop ovarian cancer in her lifetime. the five year survival rate is less than 44%, making ovarian cancer the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. this number has not changed significantly in the last 20 years in spite of advances in platinum-based chemotherapy
 <cit> . for this reason, there is a critical need to explore effective chemoprevention strategies.

it has been estimated that at least 30% of all cancers could be prevented through diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight
 <cit> . one outcome of this approach is the reduction of the chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation that accompanies obesity. chronic inflammation has been implicated to play a causative role in many diseases, including cancer
 <cit> . further reduction of inflammation can be achieved by lowering the ratio of omega- <dig> to omega- <dig> fatty acids. the modern western diet contains a high ratio of omega- <dig> to omega- <dig> fatty acids, a profile that is both pro-inflammatory and oxidant-rich and creates an environment conducive to the development of disease. flaxseed is one of the richest plant sources of omega- <dig> fatty acids. in addition, flaxseed also contains lignans, a class of phytoestrogens that also act as antioxidants
 <cit> . these two different nutriceuticals have pathway-specific actions, targeting inflammation and oxidative damage.

research into the etiology of ovarian cancer has been limited by the lack of suitable animal models. the laying hen is a robust model in that ovarian cancer develops spontaneously with pathological and histological presentation very similar to human disease
 <cit> . as in women, the average age of onset occurs later in reproductive life, with 40% of hens having the disease by six years of age
 <cit> . the disease can progress rapidly, with transcoelomic spread disseminating from the ovary to organs and peritoneal surfaces, and with the accumulation of ascites. the four histotypes observed in human are represented in the hen, although the endometrioid type is the predominant form found in the hen whereas the serous type is most prevalent in women
 <cit> . mutations in p <dig> are common in epithelial ovarian cancer  from both species
 <cit> . numerous characteristic markers are also shared between the tumors of the two species such as ca-125
 <cit> , cyp1b1
 <cit> , e-cadherin
 <cit>  and cox-1
 <cit> . the expression of cox- <dig> and accompanying high levels of prostaglandin e <dig> presents a target for dietary intervention with omega- <dig> fatty acids. our one year study of hens fed a diet of 10% flaxseed showed reduction in cancer severity that corresponded to a reduction in prostaglandin levels
 <cit> . this suggests that ovarian cancer progression may be driven by inflammation. our long term study in which hens were fed a diet supplemented with 10% flaxseed for four years resulted in a significant decrease in both incidence and severity of ovarian cancer
 <cit> . this suggests that in addition to decreased progression, initiation and/or promotion of this disease may be slowed by some component of flaxseed. this data is dually important in that it highlights the utility of the hen model for use in dietary studies of chemoprevention, and it provides strong evidence that dietary flaxseed significantly affects the initiation, promotion and progression of ovarian cancer. thus, identification of the pathways altered by flaxseed may give insight into the etiology of the disease.

the objective of the current study was to identify possible targets and pathways affected by dietary flaxseed and by ovarian cancer to determine the mechanisms by which flaxseed confers chemoprotection against ovarian cancer. we performed a microarray analysis which compared normal ovaries and ovarian tumors from hens fed a control diet to those of hens fed a diet supplemented with 10% flaxseed. microarray analysis was followed by comprehensive bioinformatics and several levels of experimental validation. this analysis revealed that pathways associated with branching morphogenesis are significantly increased in ovarian cancer and reduced by flaxseed, suggesting that the process driving tumor growth and progression toward a glandular morphology are targeted by the biologically active constituents of flaxseed.

RESULTS
flaxseed modulates genes linked to ovarian cancer in the laying hen
to evaluate the genome-wide effect of flaxseed in ovarian cancer, we conducted microarray and bioinformatics analyses. the agilent custom 4x44k chicken long oligo microarray
 <cit>  was utilized for this study based on 2x <dig> experimental conditions, i.e. diet  and tissue . the samples were obtained from the one year flaxseed study
 <cit> . we performed a 6-way pair analysis of the gene list between the following groups:  <dig>  control cancer  to control normal ;  <dig>  control cancer to flax normal ;  <dig>  flax normal to flax cancer ;  <dig>  flax cancer to control normal;  <dig>  control normal to flax normal;  <dig>  flax cancer to control cancer . the gene expression pattern in each analysis group is distinct and separates one group expression pattern from another, suggesting the effect of flaxseed is diverse at the gene level . this result encouraged us to focus on specific sets of genes which are linked to cancer progression. annotated genes used in the 4x44k arrays were classified based on their biological and molecular pathways using a pathway analysis tool which yielded  <dig> genes  related to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer
 <cit> . further, we measured the expression of these  <dig> genes in the cc, cn, fn, & fc groups and pair wise analyses were carried out between the groups . comparing the expression in different sample groups suggests that the group fed with flaxseed downregulated cancer promoting pathways such as angiogenesis, vegf signaling, endothelin signaling, wnt signaling, cadherin signaling, inflammation and oxidative stress signaling. similarly, tumor suppressor pathways such as p <dig> signaling, apoptosis signaling, cell cycle, and jak/stat signaling were upregulated, indicating that the flaxseed acts as an overall tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the ovarian cancer associated pathways and promoting tumor suppressor pathways.figure  <dig>

microarray identification of genes responsive to flaxseed
in order to identify the genes which may be directly linked with ovarian cancer progression, a comparison was made of all cancer groups  to all normal groups  i.e. cc-cn to fc-fn, cc-cn to fc-cn and fc-fn to cc-fn. this exercise generated  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes which were common in both cancer groups , indicating that their differential expression may be involved in ovarian cancer pathogenesis . in order to examine the flaxseed responsive genes, we filtered and sorted a list of  <dig> genes  from our microarray analysis which are involved in ovarian cancer and may be targets of flaxseed. further examination of the expression levels of these  <dig> genes in cc-cn and fn-cn  revealed that there is differential expression between the groups. the genes exhibit a difference in magnitude of expression , indicating that the degree of difference in expression is crucial for cancer progression . genes that are upregulated in cancer are also increased in tumors from flax-fed animals but not to the same extent. this is in agreement with earlier observations demonstrating that the expression of certain genes above a critical threshold plays a protective role against carcinogenesis but their aberrant expression beyond this critical level may have an adverse effect
 <cit> . comparison of  <dig> genes between flax-normal vs. control-cancer showed that most of these genes have significant differences in their expression levels.figure  <dig>

real time pcr validation corroborates flaxseed responsive genes found by microarray analysis
to validate our microarray analysis, we evaluated the mrna levels of  <dig> genes by pcr-array. these were representative genes identified by pathway analysis to be involved in angiogenesis, signaling , cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and developmental pathways . figure 
 <dig> shows the expression of  <dig> genes in each sample group. the level of gene expression of these genes quantified by qpcr significantly matches with the array results . of the  <dig> genes not shown, four are the house keeping genes used for normalization, five were selected for further validation, and  <dig> were not significantly different between groups. one of the important observations of the study was that the well-established cancer promoting and inflammatory genes like il <dig>  vegf <dig>  igf <dig>  ptgs <dig>  cmyc and ccdn1
 <cit>  were modulated by flaxseed compared to control-fed hens. reduction in the expression of these inflammatory genes suggests that flaxseed mitigates cancer promoting activities and acts as an anticancer agent. stemness-associated genes klf <dig>  oct <dig> and sox2
 <cit>  were also analyzed. sox <dig>  klf <dig> and oct <dig> were elevated in tumors from control-fed hens. however, in tumors from flax-fed hens, only sox <dig> was greatly reduced whereas both klf <dig> and oct <dig> expression was enhanced. thus, flaxseed did not have a uniform effect on the expression of genes associated with stem cells.table  <dig>

e-cadherin, pax <dig>  msx <dig>  foxa2and engrailed-1are upregulated in hen ovarian cancer and decreased by dietary flaxseed
the gene that showed the greatest induction by the microarray analysis was e-cadherin, with a 44-fold increase in tumors compared to normal ovary. up-regulation of e-cadherin expression is one of the earliest events in the development of eoc and is common to all ovarian cancer histotypes
 <cit> . this e-cadherin pattern could potentially have diagnostic value, but more importantly, identifying factors that regulate e-cadherin expression in the ovary may give clues as to which pathways become dysregulated very early on during the transformation of normal cells toward a malignant phenotype. we have shown previously that e-cadherin is significantly upregulated in hen ovarian cancer similar to what is observed in the human disease
 <cit> . qpcr analysis from the current study reveals that e-cadherin mrna is decreased more than 40% in tumors from hens fed flaxseed  and e-cadherin protein has been shown to be decreased by 50% in tumors from flax-fed hens
 <cit> . e-cadherin is expressed in the ovarian surface epithelium  and expression in the tumor compartment is confined to the glandular epithelial cells . the observation that flaxseed decreases e-cadherin in ovarian cancer reveals that flaxseed modulates very early events in neoplastic transformation.figure  <dig>

 colocalize with e-cadherin in glandular epithelial tumor cells. only e-cadherin is expressed in normal ovarian tissue; pax <dig>  foxa <dig> and en- <dig> are not . dietary flaxseed does not alter the spatial expression of these factors .



the microarray analysis and pcr array identified an additional group of genes that were upregulated in cancer and targeted by flaxseed. these were genes encoding transcription factors involved in early development, cell-fate determination and morphogenesis including pax2
 <cit> 
, foxa2
 <cit> 
, msx2
 <cit>  and en1
 <cit> . the expression of these genes was assayed in samples obtained from the five year study 
 <cit> . in agreement with data from both human
 <cit>  and chicken
 <cit> , we find pax <dig> expression is upregulated 9-fold in ovarian cancer from control-fed hens compared to normal ovaries from control-fed hens. additionally, we show that flaxseed attenuated this upregulation in ovarian tumors to 6-fold compared to normal ovaries. msx <dig>  a member of the muscle segment homeobox family, is upregulated 5-fold in ovarian tumors from control-fed hens compared to normal ovaries. dietary flaxseed significantly decreased this upregulation to 2-fold in ovarian tumors. foxa <dig> mrna is aberrantly over-expressed 7-fold in ovarian tumors from control-fed hens. this upregulation is decreased by flaxseed to 4-fold in ovarian tumors compared to normal ovaries. lastly, we show that tumors from control-fed hens exhibit a 6-fold upregulation of en <dig> mrna compared to normal ovaries, and this upregulation is decreased by flaxseed to 2-fold compared to normal ovaries. in addition, the flaxseed diet has an inhibitory effect on the expression of pax <dig>  msx <dig> and e-cadherin mrna in normal ovaries in the absence of pathology. that all of these genes are significantly downregulated in tumors from flax-fed hens suggests that they may play a role in the progression of the disease.

immunohistochemical localization of pax <dig>  foxa <dig> and en <dig> reveals that they co-localize with e-cadherin in the glandular epithelial compartment of the ovarian tumor . no expression of these factors can be detected prior to the expression of e-cadherin in the cortical region of the ovary, nor do they co-localize with e-cadherin in the ose. three of these genes play an active role in normal gland morphogenesis. in the mouse, pax <dig> protein is required for mullerian duct formation, including ductal and mesenchymal elements
 <cit> . msx <dig> expression has been reported to be increased in human ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma as a target of wnt signaling
 <cit> . it has also been shown to play a role in branching morphogenesis during mouse mammary gland development through the action of bmp signaling
 <cit> . it plays a role in both growth and apoptosis, particularly affecting the proliferative and regenerative capacity of tissue
 <cit> . foxa <dig> plays a role in mouse lung morphogenesis
 <cit>  as well as chicken oviduct development
 <cit> , where it is modulated post-transcriptionally by estrogen. it promotes epithelialization during embryogenesis
 <cit>  and has been shown to directly
 <cit>  and indirectly
 <cit>  regulate e-cadherin expression. engrailed has been best characterized in the drosophila wing for its role as a segment polarity gene that transcriptionally activates hedgehog, which in turn establishes the decapentaplegic  morphogen gradient
 <cit> . in mammals, en <dig> has been shown to be dysregulated in bladder, ovarian and prostate cancers, whereas en <dig> has been demonstrated in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma
 <cit> . interestingly, engrailed can be secreted as well as taken up by cells and urinary en <dig> levels have been proposed as a marker for prostate cancer
 <cit> . although expression of these genes may suggest a cell or tissue of origin for ovarian cancer, an alternative interpretation may be the induction of a morphogenic process in the ovary to which a plastic transformed cell responds. thus, eoc could conceivably develop in the ovary due to the activation of morphogens responsible for glandular differentiation acting on transformed cells. the parallel patterns of expression we observe in these genes in tumors from both control-fed and flax-fed hens suggests that formation of eoc is mediated in part by aberrant activation of a developmental program which controls branching morphogenesis, and that dietary flaxseed impedes or perturbs this program.

mir- <dig> family is upregulated in hen ovarian cancer compared to normal ovaries and is decreased by dietary flaxseed
it has been observed in human ovarian cancers that increased e-cadherin parallels increased levels of mir- <dig> family members
 <cit> . while the function of the mir- <dig> family in ovarian cancer is complex, this upregulation is currently under rigorous scrutiny for potential diagnostic and prognostic value. to date, the relationship between e-cadherin and the three members of the chicken mir- <dig> family has not been examined in chicken ovarian cancer. we measured expression levels of mir-200a, mir-200b, and mir- <dig> in ovarian tumors from control-fed hens and found they were upregulated 22-fold, 26-fold, and 18-fold respectively, compared to expression levels in normal ovaries. expression levels of mir-200a, mir-200b and mir- <dig> were upregulated 5-fold, 7-fold, and 8-fold respectively, in ovarian tumors from flax-fed hens compared to normal ovaries . these data show that the chicken mir <dig> family is upregulated in ovarian tumors and that flaxseed was able to significantly inhibit the up-regulation of all three members in ovarian cancer by  <dig> to 80%. it has recently been shown that mir <dig> family members can be induced in ovarian cancer cells after exposure to oxidative stress
 <cit> . flaxseed acts as an antioxidant, particularly through the action of the lignan seicoisolariceresinol diglucoside, and its metabolites enterodiol and enterolactone
 <cit> . the action of these antioxidants may account for the decreased levels of mir <dig> family members in the flax-fed hens. localization of mir-200a by in situ hybridization shows that expression is confined to the glandular epithelial compartment of the ovarian tumor, reflecting the positive correlation between mir- <dig> expression and e-cadherin expression in hen ovarian cancer . relatively few studies have shown that dietary manipulation can directly affect mirna expression. a limited number of specific dietary constituents and phytochemicals have been identified which show direct or indirect chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic action by modulation of mirna expression or activity. the majority of these studies have utilized in vitro culture systems to examine the effects of dietary constituents on mirna expression. the few whole-animal studies that have been conducted have shown promise in their abilities to modulate mirna expression
 <cit> . this is the first report of dietary modulation of micrornas in a spontaneous cancer model.figure  <dig> 
qpcr analysis of mir- <dig> family and in situ hybridization of mir200a. expression of all three members of the chicken mir- <dig> family is significantly upregulated in ovarian tumors compared to normal ovaries. expression of all three members is significantly decreased in ovarian tumors from flax-fed hens compared to tumors from control-fed hens. expression of mir-200a is confined to the tumor cells of the control-fed ovary  and flax-fed ovary . little if any expression is observed in normal ovary tissue . magnification 20x on left, 100x on right.



it has been well-established that the level of e-cadherin expression can reflect a balance between mir <dig> and zeb <dig> expression
 <cit> . the 3′ untranslated region of zeb <dig> mrna has several binding sites for the mir <dig> family and has been shown to be targeted for degradation by mir <dig>  in turn, zeb <dig> acts to repress transcription of both mir <dig> and e-cadherin
. we considered the possibility that the decrease observed in both e-cadherin and mir <dig> expression in tumors from flax-fed hens reflected increased zeb <dig> expression. analysis of zeb <dig> mrna by qpcr indicated that there was already a significant increase in zeb <dig> mrna in ovarian tumors from control-fed hens compared to normal, and a similar increase was observed in tumors from flax-fed hens compared to normal ovaries . interaction between micrornas and their mrna targets can be mediated by degradation of the mrna or by sequestration from translation. immunohistochemistry was performed to determine if zeb <dig> was expressed in the tumor epithelium. oviduct served as a positive control and no staining was observed in normal ovary . immunohistochemistry revealed that there were zeb <dig> positive cells in the normal stromal compartment  adjacent to the tumors but not in the tumor epithelial cells, nor in the stromal cells between the glandular tumor epithelia. no difference in localization was observed between tumors from control-fed and flax-fed hens. this suggests that the effect of the flaxseed diet on e-cadherin and mir <dig> in ovarian tumors in the chicken is not by way of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition mechanism caused by an increase in zeb <dig> expression in the epithelial compartment.figure  <dig>

dietary flaxseed significantly decreases expression of mir- <dig> family in hen ovarian cancer, but does not affect expression of mir- <dig> family in normal ovaries. this observation is significant in its implication that some of the chemopreventive mechanisms of flaxseed function at the epigenetic regulatory level. indeed, whole flaxseed contains elements that exert pleiotropic actions in cancer cells by functioning as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-estrogenic agents.

CONCLUSIONS
microarray analysis revealed that flaxseed downregulates certain genes associated with ovarian cancer development and progression, and that pathways known to be dysregulated in ovarian cancer are targets of flaxseed action. more importantly, these data support the idea that dietary manipulation can modulate epigenetic and transcriptional changes associated with cancer development and progression. notably, flax affects a group of genes in tumors that control branching morphogenesis during gland development, including pax <dig>  foxa <dig>  msx <dig> and en <dig>  expression of these genes explains the glandular appearance of the tumors and is evidence of the process directing tumor growth, a process that involves proliferation and subsequent differentiation into glands. the upregulation of e-cadherin is a key feature of gland development and in these tumors is paralleled by the expression of mir- <dig> family members. flaxseed downregulates all of these genes in a parallel fashion, suggesting a coordinated regulation, and without inducing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; the epithelial morphology is maintained. recently, stem-like epithelial cells have been identified in both ovarian surface epithelium and the distal cells of the tubal fimbriae
 <cit> . induction of genes involved in glandular morphogenesis may drive these stem cells to proliferate and differentiate into the ovarian cortex in response to morphogens present in the cortex. we suggest that flaxseed reduces, but may not completely eliminate, signals from the cortex that are involved in the proliferative phase of the process of branching morphogenesis, leaving the ability to differentiate intact, thereby revealing molecular targets that will provide the foundation for clinical intervention studies.
