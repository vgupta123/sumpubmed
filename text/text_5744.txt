BACKGROUND
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , catalyzing the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate  to  <dig> -biphosphoglycerate in the presence of nad+ and inorganic phosphate, is a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway  <cit> . gapdh was once considered as a simple “housekeeping gene” and has been used as a reference in gene expression and protein studies  <cit> . however, it’s recently demonstrated that gapdh plays crucial roles in many cellular processes in addition to glycolysis .

as a ubiquitous enzyme, gapdh exists in nearly all organisms. in plant cells, gapdhs, according to their different subcellular locations, could be classified into three groups as follows: gapa/b, encoded by gapa and gapb, chloroplastic phosphorylating nadp-specific gapdhs participating in photosynthetic co <dig> fixation; gapc, from gene gapc, a phosphorylating nad-dependent gapdh catalyzing the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-p  to  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate in cytoplasm; gapcp, encoded by gapcp, involved in glycolytic energy production in non-green plastids . depending on species, each type of gap gene may be further duplicated, for example, arabidopsis contains two gapa, two gapc and two gapcp genes, but only a single gapb  <cit> . in addition, plant contains a cytosolic non-phosphorylating nadp-dependent gapdh , which belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and has no close functional and structural relationships with phosphorylating gapdhs, catalyzing the oxidation of ga3p to 3-phosphoglycerate  .

gapdh is essentially a tetramer of identical or similar subunits. the glycolytic gapdhs  and a4-gapdh of oxygenic phototrophs compose of identical subunits, while the main photosynthetic isoform of land plants  consist of similar subunits. the main features of gapdh protein monomers are highly conserved in all living organisms, consisting of an n-terminal nad -binding domain called gp_dh_n domain  and a c-terminal catalytic domain named gp_dh_c domain . some gapdh genes  contain an extra incomplete cp <dig> domain . while gapns contain an adledh domain.

besides its pivotal role in glycolysis, gapdh is a moonlighting protein  <cit> . in mammals, gapdh participatosis  <cit>  and cell toxicity  <cit> . nonglycolytic functiones in signal transduction cascades, dna repair, transcriptional regulation, apopts of plant gapdh have been demonstrated as well, especially in abiotic stress responses. for instance, in aspen , gapdh showed some increase in response to water deficit  <cit> . overexpression of a cytosolic osgapc <dig> enhanced salt tolerance in rice  <cit> . furthermore, gapdh generated immunocomplex with ntosak  in salt-treated tobacco cells  <cit> . moreover, gapdh interacted with phospholipase dδ  to transduce hydrogen peroxide signals and the gapc–pldδ interaction mediated response to aba and water deficits in arabidopsis  <cit> . besides abiotic stress responses, plant gapdhs have been implicated in embryo development, pollen development, root development .

although vast studies have been conducted on biochemical properties and physiological functions of gapdhs, few systematic research on the evolution and functional divergence of gapdh gene family have been conducted, especially in wheat . recent plant genome sequencing projects have strongly promoted the identification and characterization of plant genes. wheat genome sequencing is now nearing completion . hence, a comprehensive analysis of the wheat gapdh family was conducted here. we systematically identified and characterized the gpadh genes of wheat  and compared them with gapdh in arabidopsis thaliana, hordeum vulgare, aegilops tauschii and triticum urartu. in addition, the expression profiles of gapdh genes in different tissues and at different stages as well in response to several stress were analyzed. finally, the inducible expression of wheat gapdh genes were detected by qrt-pcr experiments, and some gapdhs were found notably responding to abiotic stress.

RESULTS
identification, phylogenetic analysis and classification of wheat gapdh genes
by hidden markov model  searches on the available triticum aestivum sequenced genome,  <dig> sequences were identified.  <dig> of these sequences were removed for absence of complete gp_dh_n or gp_dh_c domain and  <dig> of them harbour both domains . then, the  <dig> putative gapdhs were used as queries to blastn against the contigs and singletons assembled from est sequences . six of them had no matched contig or singleton, suggesting that they were not expressed in wheat. finally,  <dig> gapdhs were identified in wheat . these gapdhs genes located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  chromosomes 2a, 2b, 4b and 4d contained one gapdh, respectively. chromosomes 2d, 6b, 6d, 7a, 7b and 7d contained two gapdhs, respectively. and chromosomes 6a contained  <dig> gapdhs . meanwhile,  <dig> gapns that located on chromosomes 2a, 2b and 2d were identified .table  <dig> gapdh gene family in wheat

the coding sequences  and protein sequences of wheat gapdhs that contain both domains  and gapns  were aligned by dnaman with pairwise method . it showed that the  <dig> wheat gapdh genes shared  <dig> – <dig>  % identity at both cds and putative amino acid levels. for instance, tagapdh1/ <dig>  tagapdh3/4/6/ <dig>  tagapdh5/ <dig>  tagapdh9/11/ <dig> and tagapdh10/ <dig> showed high identity  at both cds and protein sequence levels, respectively. meanwhile, the  <dig> gapns showed low identity  with gapdhs, but high identity  with each other . moreover, the molecular weights  and isoelectric points  of wheat gapdh and gapn proteins were calculated by protparam tool in expasy. the results revealed that the mws of gapdhs varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda, and that of gapns varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda, the pis of gapdhs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  while that of gapns floated around  <dig>  .

for phylogenetic analysis, classification and nomenclature, arabidopsis thaliana, hordeum vulgare, aegilops tauschii, triticum urartu and triticum turgidum gapdhs and gapns gene were identified as well . and a rooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed by the mega <dig>  program with the default parameters . combing with the proposed nomenclature and subcellular location of arabidopsis thaliana gapdhs, the employed gapdh genes could be distributed into four subfamilies . subfamily i was corresponding to gapa/b gene, subfamily ii to gapcp genes, subfamily iii to gapc gene, and subfamily iv to gapn gene. in wheat, tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were distributed into subfamily i, tagapdh5/7/9/11/ <dig> were grouped into subfamily ii, tagapdh4/6/8/10/ <dig> were clustered in subfamily iii, and all tagapns were in subfamily iv .fig.  <dig> molecular phylogenetic analysis of gapdh gene families in arabidopsis thaliana, triticum aestivum, aegilops tauschii, triticum urartu and triticum turgidum. the rooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of gapdh genes was inferred from the amino acid sequence alignments of gapdhs by mega <dig>  with neighbor-joining method under default parameters. the values on the tree represent bootstrap confidence values inferred from  <dig> replicates



structure and conserved residues analysis of gapdh
owing to the transcript annotation of wheat genome, the analysis and comparison of the structural features of gapdhs in different families were conducted . it indicated that the organization  of exons were almost conserved within each gapdh subfamily, while the introns and utrs showed variable lengths and distribution . the majority of gapdh genes in subfamilies ii, iii and iv contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> introns, respectively. and in subfamily i, gapas and gapbs mostly contained  <dig> and  <dig> introns, respectively. in wheat, gapdhs in same subfamily shared similar exon/intron structure, for example, tagapdh1/ <dig>  tagapdh4/6/810/ <dig>  tagapdh5/7/9/11/ <dig> and tagapns shared similar exon/intron structures, respectively .fig.  <dig> structure analysis of gapdh gene families in arabidopsis thaliana, triticum aestivum, aegilops tauschii and triticum urartu. gene structures of gapdhs analyzed by gsds . exons are shown as green boxes, introns are shown as thin lines, and utrs are shown as blank boxes




to investigate the conserved residues of gapdh proteins, we aligned wheat gapdh protein sequences and detected the conserved sites of them . the alignment displayed that amino acids structure of tagapdhs are fairly conserved and there are several identical regions such as “ingfgrigr”, “kyd”, “gvf”, “gakkv” “snascttnclap”, “stgaakav”, “rvpt”, “vs”, “df” and “wydnewgys”. among these regions, the “ingfgrigr”, “snascttnclap”, “rvpt”, “vs”, “df”, and “wydnewgys” match well with that of animal/fungi gapdhs alignment . it suggested that gapdhs are much conserved during evolution. furthermore, the alignment of gapns showed that gapns are nearly identical in different plants . to give a visual insight to the gapdh proteins similarity, a motif figure was constructed by submitting amino acid sequences of gapdh genes to the meme website . almost every gapdh possessed the first six motifs while every gapns possessed the last six ones, the motif structure of gapdh proteins from different species shared high similarity within each subfamily . furthermore, the conserved regions like “snascttnclap” and “wydnewgys” were exhibited completely in those motifs, meeting the results of alignment.fig.  <dig> structure of gapdh proteins in arabidopsis thaliana, triticum aestivum, aegilops tauschii, triticum urartu and triticum turgidum. the line represents the coding sequence and  <dig> motifs are shown. the amino acid sequences of gapdh were used as an input of meme. the total number of input gapdh and gapn genes is  <dig> and  <dig> respectively



expression analysis of gapdhs by microarray
to analyze the expression profiles of gapdhs, the microarray data of arabidopsis thaliana, hordeum vulgare gapdhs were downloaded from the bar website  with their accession numbers or corresponding probe set ids, the expression data of wheat gapdhs were downloaded from plexdb  . combined with the analysis on genevestigator , the tissue expression profiles and the inducible expression profiles in response to stress of gapdhs were generated .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of gapdhs in different tissues. a expression profiles of arabidopsis thaliana gapdhs in different tissues. b expression profiles of barley gapdhs in different tissues. c expression profiles of wheat gapdhs in different tissues. d expression profiles of wheat gapdhs in different tissues at different development stages. number 1– <dig> mean germination, seedling growth, tillering, stem elongation, booting, inflorescence emergence, anthesis, milk development, dough development and ripening stages, respectively



gapdh genes were expressed almost all over the plant developmental stages and showed notable tissue specificity . in arabidopsis, atgapa <dig>  atgapa <dig> and atgapb were significantly highly expressed in leaf but their expression in root were negligible relative to that in leaf. atgapcs and atgapn were highly expressed in root, leaf and flower. while atgapcps showed low expression level in all tissues except relatively high level in root . in barley, hvgapdh <dig>  hvgapdh <dig> and hvgapn shared the same expression pattern that significantly high in leaf but extremely low in other tissues. meanwhile, hvgapdh <dig> slightly and nearly constantly expressed in all tissues, just as atgapcps did . then in wheat, tagapdh <dig> and tagapn <dig> were strongly expressed in leaf, shoot, crown and inflorescence but the case came out opposite in root. in addition, tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were expressed at roughly steady but various levels in all tissues, and among them, tagapdh4/ <dig> and tagapdh7/ <dig> shared synchronous expression patterns, respectively .

expression profiles of gapdh genes response abiotic stresses
the expression patterns of wheat gapdh genes under cold, heat, drought and salt treatments were detected by qrt-pcr  and that of arabidopsis were generated with the microarray data from arabidopsis efp browser . their expression profiles appeared to be complex in view of the results.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of gapdh genes under abiotic stresses. a expression heatmap of gapdhs under abiotic stresses in arabidopsis. the microarray data was downloaded from arabidopsis efp browser. heatmap was plot by heatmapper. b expression heatmap of gapdhs under abiotic stresses in wheat. the data came from qrt-pcr analysis with 2–ΔΔct method. heatmap were generated with mev v <dig> . the relative expression levels were intuitively reflected in the heatmap with the gradient color green/black/red 



under cold treatments, in arabidopsis, atgapas showed slightly increased expression at early stress stage in shoots but were strongly up-regulated in roots. atgapb were intensely transcribed in both shoots and roots. roughly, atgapcs showed up-regulated expression in shoots and down-regulated expression in roots. atgapcps shared same expression pattern: significantly up-regulated in shoots and down-regulated in roots . while in wheat, tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were dramatically up-regulated in shoots . in roots, tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were up-regulated, and tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were notably down-regulated .

exposed to heat stress, transcription of most arabidopsis gapdhs were reduced in both shoots and roots except for atgapb and atgapc <dig> were slightly up regulated in shoots . tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were up-regulated, and tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were down-regulated in shoots. in roots, most of tagapdhs were down-regulated except tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> .

during drought treatment, atgapas showed down-regulated expression in shoots and fluctuant expression in roots. atgapb were up-regulated at first and down-regulated later in shoots. in roots, atgapb were intermittently up and down-regulated. atgapcps were prominently up-regulated in shoots and transcribed without sharp variation in roots . in wheat shoots, tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were found up-regulated. moreover, tagapdh <dig>  tagapdh <dig> and tagapdh <dig> were down regulated. while in roots, at early stage of stress, all these tagapdhs except tagapdh <dig> were up-regulated at the transcriptional levels .

immersed in thick salt solution, atgapcps in shoots and atgapas and atgapb in roots were up regulated as the processing time increasing. besides, the rest were down regulated . in addition, tagapdh <dig> in wheat shoots showed high transcription levels . furthermore, arabidopsis gapdhs expression profiles under osmotic stress were similar to that under salt treatment .

discussion
expansion of gapdh family in wheat
polyploidy genomes is a common phenomenon in the plant evolutionary process. along with the genome polyploidy, the loss and insertion of large segments and the chromosomal rearrangements have occurred frequently on chromosomes, these changes might result in gene expression, silence and loss  <cit> . common wheat  is allohexaploid. during its evolutionary process, two polyploidization issues had occurred. first of all, triticum monococcum  and aegilops speltoides  have hybridized and undergone a natural polyploidization and then been naturalized into triticum turgidum . after that, triticum turgidum have hybridized with aegilops tauschii  and undergone polyploidization once again resulting in the common wheat   <cit> . theoretically, every wheat genes would have three homoeologous gene, but as a consequence of the side effect of polyploidy, evolutionary and acclimation process, many wheat genes have only one or two homoeologous genes that expressed. here,  <dig> gapdh genes representing four major types of plant gapdh  were identified in hexaploid wheat cv. chinese spring, confirming the demonstration above. the high identity of wheat gapdhs within and between subfamilies indicated that some highly identical gapdhs may be generated via duplications . given that there were  <dig> and  <dig> gapdh genes identified in aegilops tauschii and triticum urartu , respectively , we inferred that whole genome duplication and segmental duplication have contributed to expansion of gapdhs family in wheat.

gapdhs play compelling roles in plant abiotic stress tolerance
inducible expression analysis here revealed that those investigated gapdh gene expression could be induced by at least one abiotic stress treatment . for example, tagapdh <dig> was found up-regulated significantly in shoots under cold, heat, drought and salt stresses . it implied that gapdh may have multiple functions except for metabolism roles in plant, such as involving in abiotic stress resistance. this novel function of gapdh was ubiquitous in plants. for instance, maize gapc <dig> and gapc <dig> were induced by anaerobic stress  <cit> , and overexpression of a rice cytosolic gene osgapc <dig> enhances salt tolerance  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, gapcs, transduced the h2o <dig> signal by interacting with the plasma membrane-associated phospholipase d  and the knockout of gapcs made plants less responsive to water deficits than the wild type  <cit> .

taken together, it was demonstrated that gapdh is a multifunction protein besides its key role in glycolysis, especially in plant abiotic stress resistance. further study to detect its moonlight function and illuminate concrete mechanism will enhance the understanding of this common but amazing protein.

CONCLUSIONS
wheat carried  <dig> gapdh genes, representing four types of plant gapdhs . whole genome duplication and segmental duplication might account for the expansion of wheat gapdhs. the  <dig> gapdhs were distributed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  according to phylogenetic analysis and structural characteristics, gapdhs could be classified into four subfamilies. microarray analysis showed that gapdh genes were expressed almost all over the plant developmental stages with notable tissue specificity and involved in several abiotic stresses responses. a further qrt-pcr analysis of wheat gapdhs indicated that these gapdh genes followed different expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses. it was speculated that gapdhs play roles in plants abiotic stress tolerance.
