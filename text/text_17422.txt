BACKGROUND
macropinocytosis is an endocytic process that enables cells to internalize large amounts of solutes from the external environment. macropinosomes are generated from the base of actin-mediated membrane ruffling when the lamellipodia folds back onto itself thereby forming very large endocytic structures. macropinosomes are heterogeneous in size and generally considered to be >  <dig>  μm in diameter  <cit> , a size considerably larger than clathrin-coated vesicles. the formation of macropinosomes is largely a signal dependent process that is transiently induced by growth factors such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor  and epidermal growth factor  or tumour promoting factors such as phorbol myristate acetate   <cit> . given the large size of macropinosomes, this unique organelle provides an efficient route for non-selective entry of solute macromolecules as well as considerable amounts of plasma membrane into the cell  <cit> .

macropinocytosis is important in a range of physiological processes. for example, macropinocytosis has a role in the down-regulation of signalling from the plasma membrane  <cit>  and, because of its dependence upon membrane ruffling, in cell motility  <cit> . consequently macropinocytosis is very relevant to tumour progression and metastasis. in addition, this endocytic pathway is the primary mechanism by which macrophages and dendritic cells sample their immediate environment for circulating antigens  <cit> . indeed, the major antigen presenting cells, namely macrophages and dendritic cells, are highly active in macropinocytosis  <cit> . for example, macrophages undergo extensive constitutive macropinocytosis, internalizing up to 200% of their surface area every hour  <cit> , patrolling and sampling the environment for their role as antigen presenting cells of the immune system. also immature dendritic cells are able to macropinocytose large quantities of exogenous solute as part of their sentinel function  <cit> . on the other hand, maturation of dendritic cells is associated with down-regulation of macropinocytosis to maximise the presentation of captured antigen  <cit> . in addition to antigen uptake, macropinocytosis is also considered important in the chemotactic response of neutrophils and macrophages  <cit> . this endocytic pathway is also utilised by various pathogens such as salmonella and shigella to gain entry into host cells  <cit> .

despite the physiological relevance of macropinocytosis, the molecular basis for the regulated formation and maturation of macropinosomes is very poorly understood. macropinosome formation in a range of cell types has been shown to be phosphoinositide- <dig> kinase dependent  <cit>  and unlike the relatively well-characterised phagosome, its regulation is receptor-mediated. as endocytic compartments mature, the bulk of their protein constituents are maintained  <cit> . peripheral membrane proteins are differentially recruited in a temporally dependent manner in response to a shift in the organelle's phosphoinositide composition. the phosphoinositides  have become the focus of intense interest as they are linked to a range of cell signalling events and are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. whilst ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> , ptdinsp <dig>  <cit>  and ptdinsp <dig>  <cit>  are traditionally considered to be associated with signalling at the plasma membrane in response to extracellular stimuli, the monophosphorylated phosphoinositide ptdinsp, is implicated in the membrane trafficking of the endosomal system.

sorting nexins are a large family of proteins characterised by the presence of a phox  domain at the amino terminus. the modestly conserved px domain is a sequence of  <dig> to  <dig> residues that has been shown to bind to various phosphoinositides hence the px domain confers phosphoinositide specificity to the protein  <cit> . sorting nexins have roles in endocytic trafficking events  <cit> . one such sorting nexin is snx <dig>  a  <dig> residue protein that contains a central px domain and large c-terminal domain predicted to include a bar domain  <cit> , a domain believed to be involved in membrane curvature and tubulation. snx <dig> was first discovered based on its homology to snx <dig> and subsequently shown to associate with early endosomes. we have previously reported that the px domain of snx <dig> binds specifically to ptdinsp and ptdinsp <dig>  <cit>  and snx <dig> is associated with newly-formed macropinosomes following egf stimulation  <cit> . after egf stimulation of hek <dig> cells, large eea1- and snx5-positive structures were detected in close proximity to membrane ruffles which labelled with fluid phase markers  <cit> , characteristics that define macropinosomes. we have also exploited the association of snx <dig> with macropinosomes to track their maturation in live cells  <cit> . our previous work showed that the association of snx <dig> with macropinosomes is highly dynamic and snx <dig> is localised not only to the macropinosome body but also tubules that extend and depart from the newly-formed macropinosomes  <cit> . here, we present data showing that snx <dig> modulates macropinocytic activity as well as evidence that the generation of phosphoinositides is involved in the recruitment of snx <dig> to the plasma membrane prior to macropinosome formation.

methods

macropinosome analyses
cell monolayers were cultured for various time periods in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml dextran  conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine  . the cells were then washed with media at 4°c and fixed in 4% pfa. images were captured using an lsm  <dig> meta confocal microscope and quantified for macropinosomes using an automated image analysis pipeline in imagej  <dig> v . the 'substract background' functionality was executed, and images thresholded to a binary image. dextran-positive structures at least  <dig>  μm in diameter were quantified through the 'analyze particles' feature.

for analysis of macropinosomes using endosomal markers, cell monolayers were washed twice using pbs, serum-starved for 16– <dig> h at 37°c and stimulated with egf   at 37°c for  <dig> min. cells were then washed twice in pbs, fixed in 4% pfa and stained using mouse anti-human eea <dig> followed by goat anti-mouse alexa fluor  <dig>  macropinosomes were identified based on their size   <cit> , circular structure and the staining pattern for eea <dig> which resembled a halo. the mean number of macropinosomes from a triplicate of  <dig> cells was determined. each experiment was repeated at least twice without knowledge of the identity of samples. counts were performed using the zeiss axioplan  <dig> microscope.

egf internalization assay
hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells, transiently transfected with pci-neo-egf-r for  <dig> h, were serum-starved for 16– <dig> h at 37°c. cells were washed twice using ice-cold pbs and incubated with  <dig> ng/ml alexa fluor  <dig> conjugated-egf  in serum-free media for  <dig> min on ice. excess egf was removed by washing the cells three times in ice-cold pbs. cells were resuspended in ice-cold serum-free media  and the cells were then incubated at 37°c for the indicated duration to allow egf internalization. cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis.

statistical analysis
data were analysed by an unpaired student's t-test, two-tailed.

RESULTS
snx <dig> is located on macropinosomes in both cultured and primary cells
we have previously shown that gfp-snx <dig> is associated with macropinosomes in hek-flpin cells  <cit> . the question now arises as to whether snx <dig> is also a marker of macropinosomes in primary cells and, if so, what function snx <dig> plays in the process of macropinocytosis. macrophages are known to have very high rates of macropinocytosis  <cit> . significantly, microarray data has indicated that macrophages and immature dendritic cells express very high levels of snx <dig> transcripts  <cit>  coinciding with their high macropinocytic activities. therefore, we examined if snx <dig> is a marker of macropinosomes in macrophages. analysis of the intracellular localization of endogenous snx <dig> in bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages  differentiated for  <dig> days in m-csf revealed that endogenous snx <dig> is associated with endosomes and large intracellular structures reminiscent of macropinosomes . these large intracellular structures  were readily labelled after a  <dig> min pulse of tr-conjugated dextran confirming them as newly-formed macropinosomes. furthermore, bmms were analysed by immunoblotting using an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to snx <dig>  a single ~ <dig> kda component, the expected size of snx <dig>  was detected at abundant levels in untreated primary macrophages . macropinocytosis is known to be down-regulated in macrophages by the treatment with  <dig> ng/ml lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . we examined the number of macropinosomes formed during a  <dig> min pulse labelling with dextran using an automated image analysis protocol described in the methods. untreated bmms had  <dig> macropinosomes per  <dig> cells  compared to  <dig> macropinosome per  <dig> cells  in bmms treated with lps for  <dig> h . this 58% reduction in the number of macropinosomes formed is consistent with that observed previously using bulk endocytosis markers  <cit> . phalloidin staining of the macrophages indicated that the cells remained healthy after the  <dig> h lps treatment. immunoblotting showed a 40% reduction in total level of snx <dig> protein in macrophages after a  <dig> h lps treatment . this reduced snx <dig> level is consistent with previously published microarray data  <cit> . endogenous snx <dig> is clearly associated with macropinosomes in these bmms and collectively, this data shows that snx <dig> levels correlates with macropinocytic activity.

snx <dig> modulates macropinocytosis
to directly explore the role of snx <dig> in macropinocytosis we have used hek-flpin cells which stably express snx5-gfp. this cell line was the previously described hek-flpin cell line transfected with pcdna5/frt-egfpsnx <dig>  referred to as hek-gfp-snx <dig>  <cit> . hek-gfp-snx <dig> is a polyclonal cell line where the construct is integrated in a defined chromosomal location and therefore avoids differences due to clonal variation. hek-gfp-snx <dig> has overall ~ <dig> fold-increase in the level of snx <dig> compared with hek-flpin cells  <cit> , an increase in snx <dig> level which was consistent throughout the course of these studies, as monitored by immunoblotting.

next we investigated if the elevated level of snx <dig> in hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells modulated the level of macropinocytosis. to estimate changes in macropinocytosis, newly-formed macropinosomes were labelled using a  <dig> min pulse of the fluid phase marker dextran . only dextran-positive-structures > <dig>  μm in diameter were scored as macropinosomes, and this size-based exclusion will minimise any contribution from changes in pinocytosis kinetics. untreated serum-starved hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells showed a  <dig>  fold increase  in constitutive macropinocytosis compared with parental hek-flpin cells . previously we demonstrated that snx5-positive macropinosomes were co-labelled with eea <dig> and dextran  <cit> , and eea1-positive structures  were counted as an additional measure of macropinosome number. this assay also identified a  <dig>  fold increase in the constitutive levels of macropinocytosis in the hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells . together these data show that elevated levels of snx <dig> influences the generation of macropinosomes.

we then determined the impact of the elevated level of snx <dig> on macropinocytosis after egf stimulation. after a  <dig> minute egf stimulation of serum-starved cells, hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells exhibited a  <dig>  fold increase in the number of macropinosomes compared to hek-flpin cells , utilizing the dextran-uptake assay . these data demonstrate that cells expressing elevated levels of snx <dig> have an increase in the capacity for macropinocytosis. moreover, the increase in both constitutive and receptor stimulated-macropinocytosis as a consequence of increased levels of snx <dig> indicates that this molecule plays a role in the generation of these endocytic structures.

next we investigated the relationship between egf-r signalling and macropinocytosis in the stable hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells using ag <dig>  an egf-r specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor that prevents egf-r activation  <cit> . significantly, treatment of cells with ag <dig> inhibited the increase in the number of macropinosomes normally observed when cells are treated with egf alone . dmso, the carrier for ag <dig>  had no impact on the level of macropinosomes at the same concentration . similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. the data demonstrate that the increased macropinocytic activity of hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells following egf binding is in response to cell signalling events.

to determine if the elevated macropinocytic activity induced by increased levels of snx <dig> in hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells can support the internalization of egf-r, we transfected hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells with egf-r to increase the numbers of receptors for detection by immunofluorescence. transfected hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells were incubated with alexa555-conjugated egf on ice, then the cells washed and incubated at 37°c to allow internalization of surface bound ligand-receptor complexes. as previously reported  <cit> , snx <dig> and eea <dig> are located to distinct domains of the macropinosome . after either  <dig> min  or  <dig> min incubation at 37°c, the majority  of snx5- and eea1-labeled macropinosomes were also labelled with alexa555-egf , indicating that the activated receptor can be internalized into these large structures and furthermore suggests that the formation of these structures from the plasma membranes occurs in the proximity of activated receptors.

snx <dig> functions in the formation of macropinosomes
upon egf-r activation, snx <dig> is recruited to the plasma membrane and the newly-formed macropinosomes  <cit>  and is clearly associated during the early maturation stages of individual macropinosomes  <cit> . therefore, snx <dig> may function to drive the formation of new macropinosomes and/or to regulate the maturation of the macropinosomes. to determine if elevated levels of snx <dig> in the hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells influence the rate of maturation of macropinosomes, we performed experiments to determine if the delivery of macropinosome contents to the late endosome/lysosome was altered. the content mixing assay described by luzio and colleagues was used  <cit>  where cells were first exposed to alexa647-conjugated dextran as a fluid phase marker to label late endosomes and lysosomes and then the alexa647-positive cells incubated in tr-labelled dextran for  <dig> min, washed and analyzed over the subsequent  <dig> min for mixing of the two fluorochromes as an indication of fusion of the newly-formed macropinosomes with late endosome/lysosome. no difference was detected in the proportion of macropinosomes that acquired alexa647-dextran between parental and hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells , indicating that the increased levels of snx <dig> does not affect macropinosome maturation rates. this result indicates that the observed increase in macropinosome number in hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells is not due to a delay in the kinetics of maturation. to further compare the maturation kinetics between the two cells lines we examined the rates of egf-r degradation. immunoblotting of the endogenous egf-r was performed to determine the level of receptor at various time-points after egf treatment. importantly the level of the egf-r observed prior to the addition of egf was the same between both cell lines . no significant difference was observed in the rate at which egf-r was degraded in the hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells when compared to the parental cell line . these two observations combined indicate that the kinetics of macropinosome maturation was not altered by the increased level of snx <dig> 

next we investigated if snx <dig> recruited to the plasma membrane after egf stimulation can influence the rate of formation of macropinosomes. to determine the spatial relationship between plasma membrane recruitment and the location of egf-r, serum-starved hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells were treated with egf for  <dig> min and non-permeabilised cells stained with anti-egf-r antibodies. although the staining intensity of the endogenous cell surface egf-r was weak, the receptor was detected in the ruffling edges of the cell and showed a co-localization with gfp-snx <dig> . to enhance the sensitivity, this experiment was repeated with transfected hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells expressing elevated levels of egf-r . gfp-snx <dig> was not detected on the plasma membrane in serum-starved egf-r transfected cells prior to egf treatment, however, following egf treatment cell surface gfp-snx <dig> was clearly concentrated in the ruffling edges of the cell and showed a striking co-localization with surface egf-r .

activation of egf-r results in the production of ptdinsp <dig> and its breakdown product, ptdinsp <dig>  we have shown that the px domain of snx <dig> binds to both ptdinsp as well as ptdinsp <dig>  to determine the relationship of ptdinsp <dig> generated from activated egf-r and the plasma membrane recruitment of snx <dig>  we have used the ptdinsp2-specific probe, mcherry-tapp1-ph domain  <cit> , to determine the location of ptdinsp <dig> at the plasma membrane. hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells were transfected with mcherry-tapp1-ph domain, then the cells serum-starved and treated with egf for  <dig> min. mcherry-tapp1-ph was located on the plasma membrane of egf-stimulated cells, but not non-stimulated cells, and showed co-localization with gfp-snx <dig>  demonstrating that snx <dig> was recruited to regions of the plasma membrane rich in ptdinsp <dig> after egf stimulation . significantly, treatment of egf-stimulated cells with ag <dig> resulted in the inhibition of snx <dig> recruitment to the plasma membrane . qualitative cell analysis showed a reduction from ~57% to 20% of cells with detectable snx <dig> at the cell surface . the residual 20% positive cells represents a level similar to that observed in non-stimulated cells. therefore, inhibition of egf-r tyrosine kinase activity by ag <dig> inhibits the recruitment of snx <dig> to the plasma membrane and the generation of macropinosomes. taken together we propose that activation of egf-r and its effector kinase pi3k are required for snx <dig> recruitment to the plasma membrane and subsequent generation of macropinosomes that internalize receptor-egf complexes.

discussion
the mechanisms that drive macropinocytosis are poorly defined. our previous studies showed that snx <dig> associates with newly-formed macropinosomes following egf stimulation  <cit> . given the potential of sorting nexins to have membrane binding and bending properties, mediated by the px and bar domains, snx <dig> represented a potential regulator of this endocytic process. snx <dig> is recruited to the plasma membrane following receptor stimulation and is associated with newly-formed macropinosomes derived from membrane ruffles. in this study we have analysed the impact of snx <dig> on numerous aspects of the macropinocytic process. our results demonstrate that snx <dig> is present in abundant levels in primary macrophages that possess high intrinsic macropinocytic activity and that on reduction in macropinocytosis, cell levels of snx <dig> are reduced also. moreover, stable overexpression in hek <dig> cells resulted in the recruitment of snx <dig> to the cell surface following egf stimulation and in a significant increase in the number of newly-formed macropinosomes. upon abrogation of the cell-surface recruitment of snx <dig> via inhibition of egf-r tyrosine kinase activity, the generation of macropinosomes is substantially reduced. collectively the data indicates snx <dig> is a molecular component of macropinocytosis specifically involved in the biogenesis and formation of macropinosomes.

the px domain of snx <dig> has the capacity to bind both ptdinsp and ptdinsp <dig>   <cit> . the pi binding specificity of snx <dig> contrasts with snx <dig> which binds selectively ptdinsp and ptdinsp <dig>  also based on liposome binding assays  <cit> . the plasma membrane recruitment of snx <dig> following egf stimulation is likely to be dependent on an interaction with ptdinsp <dig>  cell signalling is essential for the recruitment of snx <dig> to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane, as ag <dig> inhibited the movement of snx <dig> to the plasma membrane, presumably due to the lack of ptdinsp <dig> and its breakdown product ptdinsp <dig> . however, ag <dig> does not prevent egf-r internalization via the clathrin-dependent pathway , indicating, at least in this system that receptor dimerization is sufficient for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

given the association of egf signalling and the behaviour of snx <dig>  it is formally possible that snx <dig> is modulating the egf-r signalling cascade and thereby influencing macropinocytosis indirectly. however, our data argues for a direct role of snx <dig> in enhancing the early events of macropinocytosis rather than potentiating egf-r signalling. firstly, constitutive macropinocytosis in the absence of egf stimulation is increased > <dig> fold in hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells compared with parental hek-flpin cells. secondly, the kinetics of macropinosome maturation and the rate of egf-r degradation is similar in parental and hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells following egf stimulation, indicating snx <dig> is promoting the early events driving the biogenesis of macropinosomes, but does not influence the rate of maturation and delivery to lysosomes.

a number of the snxs can form homodimers and heterodimers in vitro and in vivo. as snx <dig> has a coiled-coil c-terminal and a predicted bar domain, it is likely that it exists as a dimer. we have previously demonstrated that snx <dig> does not form a homodimer but can associate with snx <dig> and that association of snx <dig> with endosomes appears to be dependent on the formation of snx5/snx <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . snx <dig> is selectively recruited to membrane ruffles of activated cells and is not associated with snx <dig>  <cit> . therefore it is likely that snx <dig> exists in two pools, one pool independent of snx <dig> and another pool as a heterodimer with snx <dig>  we propose that a snx1-independent pool of snx <dig> is recruited to the plasma membrane to initiate the formation of macropinosomes whereas the snx5/snx <dig> pool is recruited to a subdomain of maturing macropinosomes to promote tubulation. furthermore, the differential recruitment of snx <dig> to either plasma membrane or nascent macropinosomes is likely to be dependent on the specificity of phosphoinositide binding. clearly further studies are required to identify the partners of snx <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
based on our published data  <cit>  and the data above, our model for macropinosome maturation is as follows. following receptor stimulation, gfp-snx <dig> is recruited to discrete patches on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane via its phosphoinositide binding px domain. there is a direct relationship between the level of cell surface snx <dig> protein and macropinocytic activity, highlighting the role for this sorting nexin in driving this signal-activated endocytosis pathway. newly-formed snx5-positive macropinosomes recruit eea <dig> and the retromer complex, possibly mediated by ptdinsp arising from the hydrolysis of ptdinsp <dig>  the bar domain of snx <dig>  in a complex with other sorting nexins, has the potential to distort the limiting membrane of the macropinosome into extensive tubular elements that subsequently separate from the macropinosome and traffic in a microtubule-dependent manner to perinuclear endosomes. as the tubular structures depart from the macropinosome there is a reduction in the surface area of the macropinosome, which matures into a rab7-positive structure and eventually fuses with late endosomes/lysosomes. the identification of machinery that regulates this process now provides the ability to directly assess the biological role of macropinocytosis in a range of physiological settings.
