BACKGROUND
spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression is vital for normal growth and development in living organisms and for optimal response to environmental stimuli and endogenous cues. this regulation is achieved by multiple mechanisms operating at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels  <cit> . transcriptional regulation involving specific transcription factors interacting with their respective dna cis-elements and post-translational modifications involving protein modifications have been known for several decades. only recently, the discovery of micrornas  has greatly expanded our knowledge of the cellular mechanisms that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in eukaryotes  <cit> . recent studies have suggested that mirnas could serve as biomarkers for the identification of different types of cancers  <cit>  and/or as therapeutic targets or agents  <cit> .

biochemical studies in animals support a compartmentalized, two-step maturation of mirnas derived from their precursor transcripts originating from the mirna genes located in the intergenic regions. interestingly, many mirnas in mammals are derived from the introns of the protein coding genes. the mirnas are loaded into a silencing complex, called rna-induced silencing complex  and can guide the complex to the target mrnas. in most cases, animal mirnas recognize their target transcripts by base pairing with the 7- to 8-nt complementary region usually located in the 3'utrs on the target mrnas and thus repressing their expression  <cit> , although mrna cleavage might also occur  <cit> . in contrast to the well-documented suppression of gene expression by mirnas, mirnas were recently suggested to also enhance target gene expression, and this "oscillation of activity between silencers to enhancers of gene expression" appears to depend on the state of the cell cycle  <cit> .

since the initial discovery that lin- <dig> acts as a regulatory rna in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , interest in finding mirnas and understanding their functions in diverse organisms has grown. thus far, mirnas have been shown to play critical roles in almost all biological processes examined, such as control of developmental timing, cell proliferation, cell fate specification, embryonic stem cell differentiation, limb development, adipogenesis, myogenesis, angiogenesis and hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, apoptosis, fat metabolism, insulin secretion, and even cancer  <cit> . many mirna families are conserved among the vertebrate animals, and their functions may also have been well conserved. however, many of the new mirnas recently discovered in human and chimpanzee are not conserved beyond mammals, and ~10% are taxon specific  <cit> . as a result of extending this type of studies to more animal species, a number of lineage-specific mirnas  <cit>  and species-specific mirnas  <cit>  have been identified. these findings suggested that sequencing small rna libraries from individual organisms is important to identify and catalog conserved and novel species-specific mirnas. computational approaches are effective in identifying conserved mirnas in diverse plant or animal species  <cit> . however, the process requires knowledge of the complete genome sequence, and species-specific mirnas cannot be identified with confidence without this information. direct small rna sequencing is a straightforward and effective approach to characterize the mirnas expressed from a genome of an organism  <cit> .

pork, derived from pigs , is one of the most widely eaten meats in the world  <cit> . in recent years, the pig has been recognized as a potential model system for biomedical research, because pigs and humans have similarities in many aspects of their anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology and pharmacology  <cit> . consequently, pigs can offer a system for understanding an array of health-related aspects of humans, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, gastric ulcers, female reproductive health, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases and organ transplantation  <cit> . additionally, pigs are closer evolutionarily to humans than mice  <cit> . the economic and biomedical significance of pigs has led to the launch of the swine genome sequencing consortium   <cit>  to decipher the genome of the pig. the availability of the genome sequence and transcriptome analyses would significantly advance our ability to decipher various biological and biomedical secrets for better exploitation of the commercial traits of pigs as well as for the benefit of human health  <cit> . identification of mirnas and their target genes can provide further insights into the post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms influencing various biological and metabolic processes in pigs.

bioinformatic approaches have been used previously to identify mirnas in pig  <cit>  by exploiting the available genome sequence,  <dig> conserved mirnas have been predicted . recently, kim et al.  <cit>  reported the identification of  <dig> new mirnas belonging to conserved mirna families in pig. however, this number is small compared to the several hundreds of conserved mirnas known across the animal kingdom. in this study, we sequenced a small rna library and experimentally validated  <dig> mirnas. only  <dig> matched the pig mirnas listed in the mirbase . the remaining  <dig> mirnas represent new mirna homologs belonging to conserved mirna families . furthermore, we determined the temporal expression of  <dig> conserved and four pig-specific mirnas in diverse tissues of pig.

RESULTS
mirna library construction with pooled rna from the heart, thymus and liver of pig
recent systematic analysis of the spatial expression of mirnas in zebra fish larvae showed that most tissues and organs express a unique mirna complement  <cit> . to identify conserved and pig-specific mirnas, we constructed a small rna library using pooled rna from the heart, thymus and liver of the pig. heart represents a muscle tissue with profound diversity in gene expression  <cit> , thymus is a vital part of the immune system essential for t-lymphocytes development and maturation, and liver represents a tissue with specialized and restricted function and was found to have low level of transcript diversity  <cit> . the mirnas from such a library should reflect a higher abundance of heart-, liver- and thymus-specific mirnas. additionally, the library should provide an opportunity to identify mirnas expressed with low-abundance in these tissues. small rnas  were recovered by size fractionation, and the library was constructed as described previously  <cit> .

sequence analysis and identification of conserved mirna homologs in the pig
of the  <dig>  reads obtained from the 454/roche gs-flx massively parallel pyrosequencer, ~ <dig>  quality small rna sequences ranging from  <dig> to 30-nt were extracted after removal of the 5' and 3' adapters . the quality of our small rna library is poor as reflected by the accumulation of degradation products from mirnas . while the sequencing depth obtained in this study is certainly not exhaustive, but these many reads should be sufficient to identify many of the novel but conserved mirna homologs in pig. the low depth of the library could also be due to the technical problems associated with the sequencing. all identical sequences were counted and eliminated from the dataset, and only unique sequences with associated read counts were analyzed further. these unique sequences were subjected to blast analysis against the rfam database to remove the ribosomal rna, trna and snrna breakdown products. this analysis removed ~ <dig> sequences that represented largely breakdown products of rrnas and trnas . a search against repbase revealed  <dig> sequences as possible sequences derived from repeats. thus far, mirbase lists only  <dig> pig mirnas that were computationally predicted. a blast search with the use of the remaining unique small rna sequences revealed  <dig> unique sequences  that exactly matched with the pig mirnas listed in the latest mirbase release  <dig>   . our identification of less than 50% of the pig mirnas listed in mirbase could be due to the use of highly specialized tissues  for mirna library construction. blast searches against mirbase were performed with remaining small rnas to identify pig counterparts of the conserved mirnas. this analysis revealed  <dig> new mirnas  that are homologs of the conserved mirnas . together, our study confirmed the expression of  <dig> conserved mirnas  in pig . a significant number  of small rnas could not be mapped to the available pig genome as it exists at present. a small portion of these sequences could be potentially pig-specific mirnas or other important small rnas but their annotation requires the complete genome sequence.

in the present study, the cloning frequency of newly identified mirnas varied greatly  . some of the sequences had slight-shifts in their 5' and 3' ends, which could be attributed to processing shifts or enzymatic modifications of mirnas such as rna editing  <cit> , 3' nucleotide additions  <cit>  or sequencing artifacts.

abundantly expressed mirna families in the heart, liver and thymus: sequence-based analysis
because, we pooled the total rna from the heart, liver and thymus for library construction, matching mirnas to tissue sources is not possible. nevertheless, by comparing the tissue-specific expression patterns represented by the sequence counts, we can suggest the relative tissue contribution of at least a few mirna families. for instance, the mir- <dig> family has the highest frequency  in our sequences  and the highest level of expression in the heart, but was barely detected in thymus and liver . therefore the total mir- <dig> count in our sequences could be derived largely from heart tissue. as another example, mir- <dig> is represented by  <dig> reads . it is a liver-specific mirna, as determined by a small rna blot analysis , and these two mirnas are ubiquitously expressed in the heart, liver and thymus . thus, mirna families  that are specifically or highly expressed in any one of the  <dig> tissues, or mirnas that are expressed ubiquitously  in all  <dig> tissues, show a far greater frequency than other mirnas. a few notable exceptions are mir- <dig>  an mirna abundantly expressed in the heart , which is represented by only one read , and the mir- <dig> family, which is preferentially and abundantly expressed in the heart , and represented by only  <dig> reads . these observations suggest that cloning frequency does not always reflect the true abundance. this could be attributed to the biased cloning, although what causes the biased cloning of small rnas is unknown.

in animals and plants, mirnas exist as multigene families . with use of small rna blot analysis or probe-based mirna micro array, discriminating individual members within a mirna family is difficult. the expression information of a member of a mirna family is useful for understanding its functions and for practical use for gene manipulations  <cit> . the cloning frequency-based determination of mirna abundance can be used to assess the relative expression of each member within a mirna family. the mir- <dig> family is represented by three members  in diverse animals . we cannot ascertain whether the mir- <dig> family is also represented by three members in pig because of the lack of complete genome information, but is possible because we found mir-1a, mir-1b and mir-1c homologs in our library . of these three members, mir-1a and mir-1c are represented by  <dig> and  <dig> reads, respectively, whereas mir-1b is represented by a lower number . the let- <dig> family has  <dig> members in diverse animal species . here, we found evidence for the expression of all  <dig> let- <dig> members in pig. interestingly, the expression abundance varies among the let- <dig> family members ; let-7a and let-7j, each have  <dig> reads; similarly, let-7b, let-7c and let-7e have almost the same number of reads ; let-7d, let-7f and let-7j have  <dig> to  <dig> reads; and let-7h, let-7i and let-7k have a lower number of reads  . the mir- <dig> sequence differs from that of the let- <dig> family by one nt at position  <dig> from the 5' end, thus mir- <dig> is also a member of the let- <dig> family. mir- <dig> is represented by  <dig> reads in our sequences . hence the let- <dig> mirna family is represented by  <dig> members, and this study provides the evidence for the expression of all  <dig> let- <dig> family members in pig. similarly, we found all members of the mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families in our sequences, suggesting that all members belonging to these mirna families are expressed in these three  tissues.

several recent studies found a number of lineage-specific mirnas  <cit>  or species-specific mirnas  <cit> . small rnas in our library lacking annotations in mirbase but having perfect matches to the available pig genome are novel mirna candidates. some of the conserved mirna homologs had appeared only once in our sequences . several candidate mirnas are identified and some of them could be even detected using small rna blot analysis . these sequences have several loci in the pig genome. fold-back structures could be predicted for some loci, but not for all. however, these evidences are not adequate to annotate them as mirnas.

expression analysis of mirnas in pig
tissue-specific expression of mirnas in pig
the expression levels of individual mirnas can be determined by small rna blot analysis  <cit> . the expression of mirnas is tightly regulated, both in time and space. to analyze the tissue-specific expression patterns of mirnas, we analyzed  <dig> diverse tissues: ovary, heart, salivary glands, liver, lung, pancreas, stomach, lymph node, spleen, uterus, endometrium, pancreas, bladder and thymus. tissues were collected and stored at -80°c by the desilva laboratory as part of the ongoing porcine gene expression project  <cit> . a recent study revealed the expression of a high proportion of functionally unaccountable genes in pig muscle  <cit> , which forms the basis for analyzing mirna expression analyses in the muscle tissue such as the heart, stomach and bladder. liver and lung are tissues with specialized and restricted function and have a low level of transcript diversity  <cit> , so we examined the mirna expression in these tissues. we chose testes as representative of male reproductory tissues. interestingly, greater gene diversity in testes has been reported  <cit> . uterus, ovaries and endometrium were chosen for mirna expression analysis as representatives of female reproductive tissues. immune-related tissues were lymph node and thymus. we also included specialized organs such as pancreas, spleen and salivary glands in the analysis.

mirnas abundantly or specifically expressed in the heart
mir- <dig> is one of the highly conserved mirnas and found to be abundantly and specifically expressed in the heart and other muscular tissues  <cit> . our small rna blot analysis indicated that mir- <dig> was highly expressed in the heart but moderately in the stomach, testes, bladder and spleen . mir- <dig> was barely detected in the liver, with only trace amounts in the thymus . thus, the high abundance of mir- <dig> as indicated by the number of sequence reads is associated with its high expression in the heart. the high level of mir- <dig> in the pig heart is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . like mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> is a muscle-specific mirna  because of its abundant expression in many other muscular tissues such as heart and skeletal muscle  <cit> . the expression patterns of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> largely overlapped in many tissues examined in this study .

because of their location within the introns of myosin genes and their specific expression in myogenic cells, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were referred to as myomirs  <cit> . mir- <dig> is encoded in intron  <dig> of the human and mouse αmhc gene  <cit> . because this is an intronic-derived mirna, its expression pattern is similar to that of the host gene, αmyosin heavy chain  or myh <dig>  αmhc is expressed specifically in the heart and pulmonary myocardium  <cit> . consistently, mir- <dig> is specifically and abundantly expressed in the heart, but we found a very weak expression  in lungs . these results are in agreement with the expression analysis of mir- <dig> in rats and humans  <cit> . similarly, mir- <dig> is another intronic-derived mirna located in the myh7b gene . mir- <dig> is abundantly and specifically expressed only in the heart and could not be detected in other tissues . similar observations have been reported for mir- <dig> in zebra fish  <cit> .

mirnas specifically or abundantly expressed in the liver
we observed specific and abundant expression of mir- <dig> in the liver . previous reports have characterized mir- <dig> as a liver-specific mirna in diverse animals  <cit> , and it has been linked to lipid metabolism and liver homeostasis  <cit> . we also found mir- <dig> abundantly expressed in the liver, and its level of expression was comparable with that of mir- <dig> . the liver-associated expression of mir- <dig> in the mouse has been reported recently  <cit> . we also detected a trace amount of mir- <dig> in pig stomach . mir- <dig> has been implicated in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and maturation  <cit> , and our finding of mir- <dig> expression in stomach of the pig is consistent with this previous report  <cit> .

mirnas abundantly expressed in the thymus
one of the key features of a functional immune system is its ability to distinguish antigens of foreign origin from those derived endogenously and subsequently to mount an immune response against such antigens. with respect to t cells, this goal is achieved through antigen recognition by t-cell receptors and a highly ordered developmental process in the thymus  <cit> . many mirnas are differentially regulated in hematopoietic lineages, and some have been shown to play roles in controlling the development of immune cells  <cit> . mir-142-3p, a hematopoietic-specific mirna  <cit> , exhibits distinct expression patterns during t-cell development and maturation  <cit> . our study revealed mir- <dig> and mir-142-3p with relatively high expression in thymus , and mir18a and mir-20a appeared to be weakly expressed in thymus . mir-18a and mir-20a are located within the mir-17- <dig> cluster, which contains mirnas known as "oncomirs" because of their overexpression in many types of cancer cells  <cit> . because these mirnas are polycistronic, their similar expression patterns were expected. surprisingly, the expression pattern of mir-20a's differed from that of mir18a in different tissues. these findings raise the possibility that the processing of mature mirnas within a mirna cluster may vary among tissues. additionally, many other mirnas, such as let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir <dig>  mir-26b, mir-29c, mir-30c and mir <dig>  were also expressed abundantly in thymus .

mirnas with highly varied expression patterns in different tissues
mir- <dig> expression varied substantially among the  <dig> tissues examined . it was highly expressed in stomach, testes, bladder and spleen and moderately in the other tissues but undetected in the thymus . the expression of mir- <dig> was highly variable among the tissues tested . the expression of mir- <dig> also varied among the tissues; it could be detected in liver, stomach, salivary glands, pancreas, spleen, lymph node and testes but not in thymus and bladder tissues. some mirnas, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-18a, mir- <dig> and mir-142-3p, showed a weaker expression than other mirnas tested by small rna blot analyses .

ubiquitously expressed mirnas
some other mirnas were detected in almost all tissues that we analyzed . let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-130a and mir- <dig> showed uniform levels of expression in  <dig> different tissues but were hardly detected in pancreas . mir- <dig>  mir-26b, mir-29c, mir-30c and mir- <dig> exhibited almost similar expression patterns in all tissues examined . however, a few minor differences were noticed in the expression of some mirnas. for instance, mir-29c was expressed abundantly in stomach but only in trace amounts in thymus and ovary and mir-30c was relatively strongly expressed in heart, lungs, stomach and endometrium .

discussion
post-transcriptional gene regulation guided by mirnas has emerged as one of the major gene regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes. in the present study, we have identified a total of  <dig> conserved mirna homologs in pig. conserved mirnas are likely play an important role in regulating basic cellular and developmental pathways from lower to higher organisms, whereas the non-conserved mirnas are thought to be important in lineage-specific or species-specific pathways and functions  <cit> .

small rna blot analysis does not always reflect cloning frequency
often, sequencing-based mirna expression profiling has been used as a tool to measure the relative abundance of mirnas  <cit> . our sequence analysis in this study indicated that mir- <dig> family  has the highest abundance . in agreement with this observation, mir- <dig> is the most abundantly expressed mirna in the heart but not in the liver or thymus , two other tissues used for mirna library generation. a similar picture has emerged for mir- <dig>  a liver-specific mirna and one of the highly represented mirnas in our sequences. however, this correlation may not always be the case. for instance, mir- <dig> is represented only by  <dig> clones  in our sequences, which indicates a 100-fold lower expression level compared with that of mir- <dig> family, if cloning frequency taken as a measure of expression. however, our small rna blot analysis indicated a different picture as mir- <dig> was detected as abundantly as mir- <dig> in the heart . these two mirna genes – mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> – exist as a cluster and thus are always expressed together in mouse  <cit> . the discrepancies between the cloning frequency and small rna blot results for mirna- <dig> and mir- <dig> could not be attributed to the rna source because the same rna samples were used for both experiments . we also used approximately a similar amount  of 32p-labelled probe for detection of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  in our view, small rna blot analysis provides a more reliable measure of abundance. therefore, the above discrepancy could be largely due to biased cloning efficiencies of these two mirnas. in arabidopsis, a similar discrepancy between the cloning frequency and small rna blot results was observed for mir <dig> previously  <cit> . what causes the biased cloning is not clear but could be attributed to the differences in the 5'- and 3'-end nucleotides, which are involved in ligating with the 5' and 3' adapters, respectively, or formation of secondary structures or adoption of a structure that prevents the exposure of 5' or 3' ends of the mirna.

tissue-specific expression of mirnas and their impact on gene expression
the expression of mirnas is tightly regulated both in time and space. tissue-specific mirnas or a high level of expression of mirnas only in certain tissues implies that these mirnas play critical roles in the tissues where they are expressed. the observation that mir- <dig>  mir-26b, mir- <dig>  mir-29c and mir-30c are ubiquitously expressed in  <dig> different tissues of pig is interesting. similarly, let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-130a are abundantly expressed in  <dig> of the  <dig> tissues  . these results suggest a very important role for these mirnas in the regulation of constitutive processes in diverse tissues.

the mir-17- <dig> cluster  encodes six mirnas  located in the third intron of a ~7-kb primary transcript known as c13orf <dig>  <cit> . although mir-18a and mir-20a are likely derived from the same primary-transcript, the expression levels of these mature mirnas are not similar . this finding suggests that their processing varies in different tissues. expression profiling studies have also revealed widespread overexpression of the mir-17- <dig> cluster in diverse tumor subtypes, including both hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors such as those derived from breast, colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach  <cit> .

several mirnas  have distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. most animal mirnas were thought to regulate several dozens of genes involved in diverse pathways and processes  <cit> . additionally, many targets of these mirnas are regulatory molecules such as transcription factors, which in turn may affect the expression of a large number of genes. therefore, the impact of a mirna expressed or not expressed in a specific tissue has a profound effect on the overall gene expression profiles in a particular tissue.

the use of three specialized tissues for library generation is a major limitation for the discovery of mirnas in pig. generating more small rna libraries from diverse tissues should identify additional conserved and porcine-specific mirnas. while our manuscript was in preparation, kim et al.,  <cit>  reported  <dig> new pig mirnas;  <dig> of these  are conserved mirna homologs, and the remaining  <dig> are mirna* sequences . we have identified  <dig> of these mirnas but did not find the remaining six mirnas, possibly because these were not expressed or were expressed only at very low levels in the heart, liver and thymus tissues we used for the library.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study has identified a total of  <dig> mirnas in the pig. the expression for  <dig> conserved and three candidate mirnas was determined in diverse tissues of the pig. the findings from this study will be a highly valuable resource for future transcriptomic and proteomic studies, as well as for annotating the pig genome in the near future.
