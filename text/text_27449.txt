BACKGROUND
grapevine  is a major fruit crop worldwide that is susceptible to many microbial infections, especially by fungi, thus requiring an intensive use of phytochemicals. the economic costs and negative environmental impact associated with these applications led to search for alternative strategies involving activation of the plant's innate defense system. in order to efficiently limit the losses due to diseases, it is therefore necessary to have a thorough knowledge of grapevine disease resistance mechanisms.

plants have developed a two-layered innate immune system for defense against pathogens. primary innate immunity, the first line of defense of plants, is achieved through a set of defined receptors, that recognize conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns  <cit> . in order to defend themselves against pathogens that can suppress primary defense mechanisms, plants have developed a secondary defense response that is triggered upon recognition of race-specific effectors. resistance proteins monitor these effectors and subsequently trigger secondary defense responses that often culminate in localized cell death response associated with additional locally induced defense responses, that block further growth of the pathogen  <cit> . after recognition of the invading microorganism, induced resistance to different types of pathogens is achieved through a network of signal transduction pathways in which the small molecules salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene  act as secondary messengers  <cit> . these regulators then orchestrate the expression of sets of downstream defense genes encoding antimicrobial proteins or enzymes catalyzing the production of defense metabolites. plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens is classically believed to be mediated through sa signalling  <cit> . sa accumulation as well as the coordinated expression of pathogenesis related  genes encoding small proteins with antimicrobial activity are also necessary to the onset of systemic acquired resistance  in plants. sar is a plant immune response that establishes a broad spectrum resistance in tissues distant from the site of primary infection  <cit> .

in the past years, considerable progress has been made in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana in identifying genes that affect regulation of defense gene expression. several key plant defense regulators especially involved in the sa signalling pathway have been cloned and characterized  <cit> . the npr <dig> mutant was isolated in a genetic screen for plants that failed to express pr <dig> gene after sar induction  <cit> . npr <dig>  has been identified as a key positive regulator of the sa-dependent signalling pathway and is required for the transduction of the sa signal to activate pr gene expression and systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . the npr <dig> gene was cloned in  <dig> and shown as encoding a novel protein containing ankyrin repeats involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . npr <dig> is constitutively expressed and levels of its transcripts increased only two-fold following sa treatment, suggesting that it is regulated at the protein level  <cit> . indeed, npr <dig> activity is regulated by redox systems which have been recently identified  <cit> . inactive npr <dig> is present as cytosolic disulfide-bound oligomers in the absence of pathogen attack. following sa induction, oligomeric npr <dig> is reduced to active monomers  <cit> . npr <dig> monomers are translocated to the nucleus where they interact with the tga class of basic leucine zipper transcription factors, leading to the expression of sa-dependent genes  <cit> . recent studies have also involved wrky transcription factors in sa defense responses downstream or in parallel with npr <dig>  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, the npr1-dependent sa pathway controls the expression of pr <dig>  pr <dig>  and pr <dig>  genes. in contrast, induction of distinct defense genes encoding the defensin pdf <dig>  and the pr <dig>  proteins is controlled by ja/et dependent pathways  <cit> .

originally, the npr <dig> mutant was thought to be only deficient in sa-mediated defense. however, it was shown that npr <dig> plays a role in other defense signalling pathways. in npr <dig>  the establishment of induced systemic resistance  in leaves by non-pathogenic root rhizobacteria is blocked. interestingly, this resistance response is independent of sa but requires et and ja signalling  <cit> . apart from npr <dig>  arabidopsis genome contains five npr1-related genes called atnpr <dig> to atnpr <dig>  <cit> . members of the atnpr family encode proteins sharing two domains involved in mediating protein-protein interactions: the broad complex, tramtrack and bric a brac/pox virus and zinc finger  domain in the n-terminal and the ankyrin repeat domain  in the middle of the protein. whereas atnpr <dig> to atnpr <dig> have been implicated in signalling of defense responses, atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig>  form a distinct group involved in the regulation of developmental patterning of leaves and flowers  <cit> .

atnpr <dig> has been over-expressed in arabidopsis, rice, tomato and wheat, resulting in enhanced bacterial and fungal resistance  <cit> . moreover, homologs of atnpr <dig> have been cloned and characterized in several crop plants including rice  <cit> , apple  <cit> , banana  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> . in rice, over-expression of osnpr <dig> conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants  <cit> . similarly, over-expression of the malus npr <dig> in two apple cultivars resulted in activation of pr genes and enhanced resistance to erwinia amylovora and to two important fungal pathogens of apple  <cit> .

in grapevine, many studies described the induction of pr proteins and the production of stilbenes after infection  <cit> . however, signalling pathways and regulatory elements leading to the induction of these responses remain to be characterized in this species. recently, two genes encoding transcription factors of the wrky family and potentially involved in grapevine resistance to pathogens have been characterized. overexpression of vvwrky <dig> and vvwrky <dig> in tobacco conferred reduced susceptibility to different types of fungi  <cit> .

recent completion of vitis vinifera genome sequencing in a highly homozygous genotype and in a heterozygous grapevine variety has led to the identification of putative resistance genes and defense signalling elements  <cit> . based on conserved domain analyses, the grape genome was found to contain a number of genes showing a nucleotide binding site  and a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat  typical of resistance  genes  <cit> . besides putative r genes, the grape genome contains several candidate genes encoding putative signalling components for disease response, with similarity to arabidopsis eds <dig>  pad <dig>  ndr <dig> and npr <dig>  <cit> . a possible role of the two grapevine regulatory elements sharing sequence similarity to the arabidopsis sa signalling components ndr <dig> and eds <dig> was recently described by our group  <cit> .

given the pivotal role of atnpr <dig> in plant defense, we decided to take advantage of data from grapevine est databases and genome sequencing to identify two genes encoding proteins with similarity to atnpr <dig>  that we called vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig> . expression of these genes was studied after treatment with benzothiadiazole  and after inoculation of two resistant or susceptible vitis species with plasmopara viticola, the causal agent of downy mildew. nuclear localization of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  was demonstrated by expressing gfp fusions. to get further insight into vvnpr <dig> function, the two genes were transiently overexpressed in both n. benthamiana and vitis vinifera leaves and consequences on pr gene induction were studied.

RESULTS
identification and sequence analysis of two npr1-like genes in vitis vinifera
at the beginning of this study, the grapevine genome was not entirely sequenced. the nucleic acid sequence of atnpr <dig>  was used to search an est database of abiotically stressed vitis vinifera cv chardonnay leaves . two ests with significant similarity to atnpr <dig> were identified. sequence comparison of these two est with data from grapevine genome sequencing project  <cit>  enabled us to obtain the two full-length cdnas, named vvnpr <dig>   and vvnpr <dig>  . amino acid sequence comparison of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  showed that the two proteins display 47% identity and 66% similarity. completion of v. vinifera genome sequencing has revealed only two genes related to "defense" atnprs .

amino acid sequence comparisons showed that vvnpr <dig>  has a higher identity with atnpr <dig>  than vvnpr <dig>  . vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  were also compared to npr <dig> homologs in different plant species. phylogenetic analysis  reveals that vvnpr <dig>  groups closely with tobacco and tomato npr <dig> proteins , with npr <dig> from monocots and with atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig>  vvnpr <dig>  forms a discrete group with npr <dig> from apple , atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> 

vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  encode putative proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids respectively . according to prosite tool  <cit> , vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  are predicted to have the same overall organization as members of the atnpr family, with an amino terminal btb/poz domain and a central ankyrin repeat domain . in addition, the carboxy terminal domains of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  are rich in basic amino acids typical of nuclear localization signals . kinkema et al.  <cit>  showed that five residues in the c-terminus of atnpr <dig> are essential for its nuclear translocation and constitute the nls <dig>  four of these five amino acids are conserved in vvnpr <dig>  , whereas some lysine residues have turned into arginine in vvnpr <dig> . basic amino acids of the second nls in atnpr <dig> have been shown to be not necessary for nuclear targeting  <cit>  and are less conserved among the different homologs even in the two grapevine proteins .

vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  expression following bth treatment in grapevine leaves
in arabidopsis, atnpr <dig> is constitutively expressed and can be further stimulated by sa or  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid  treatment and by infection with hyaloperonospora parasitica  <cit> . in order to study the expression profile of the two grapevine npr <dig> genes, detached leaves of vitis vinifera cv chardonnay were treated with a solution of bth . we also monitored the expression of a grapevine pr <dig> gene, a sar marker, whose sequence is the most closely related to arabidopsis sa-dependent pr <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  vvpr <dig> expression was strongly stimulated by bth as soon as  <dig> h posttreatment compared to water-treated leaves where vvpr <dig> expression was almost undetectable. vvnpr <dig>  was constitutively expressed in water-treated leaves, but expression was only slightly upregulated by bth treatment . interestingly, vvnpr <dig> , whose expression was also detectable in control leaves, was further induced by bth and peaked between  <dig> to  <dig> h after treatment . these results show that, as observed in arabidopsis, vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  are constitutively expressed in grapevine and that vvnpr <dig>  expression can be further enhanced by a sar inducer.

expression patterns of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  during compatible and incompatible interactions with plasmopara viticola
we have next investigated whether the expression of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  could be modulated after pathogen infection and whether their expression was differentially affected during compatible or incompatible interactions. grapevine and related species exhibit a wide spectrum of resistance to the biotrophic pathogen plasmopara viticola, the downy mildew agent. two different vitis species, the resistant vitis riparia cv gloire de montpellier and the susceptible vitis vinifera cv chardonnay, were challenged with plasmopara viticola or water as control. the expression patterns of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  were determined after inoculation using real-time quantitative pcr. the expression of each gene after inoculation was calculated as fold induction compared to h2o-inoculated leaves at the same time point as described by pfaffl et al  <cit> .

five days after inoculation with p. viticola, a number of necrotic spots were observed on leaves of the resistant species v. riparia, whereas sporangia covered almost the entire leaf surface of the susceptible v. vinifera . expression of a stilbene synthase gene  was determined as a positive control of defense gene induction by p. viticola infection. as expected,p. viticola inoculation triggered vvsts expression in both susceptible and tolerant vitis species . however, vvsts expression was enhanced much earlier in resistant v. riparia, where transcripts began to accumulate  <dig> h after inoculation and were stimulated about 20-fold at  <dig> days. in contrast, maximal induction of vvsts expression was measured  <dig> days after inoculation in v. vinifera cv chardonnay . thus, vvsts transcript accumulation was delayed in susceptible v. vinifera cv chardonnay compared to resistant v. riparia.

transcript accumulation of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  was then quantified after p. viticola infection. as shown in figure 3b and 3c, no significant change in the expression of these two genes was detectable for either genotype. other studies from our group have shown that constitutive expression of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  was also not affected by infection with botrytis cinerea or with pseudomonas syringae pv pisi . taken together, expression studies suggest that vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  are not regulated at transcriptional level upon pathogen infection.

subcellular localization of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig> 
the amino acid sequences of both vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  were found to contain a putative nuclear localization signal  in the c terminus of the protein . to determine the subcellular localization of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig> , the coding regions of vvnpr <dig> , vvnpr <dig> , and atnpr <dig> were fused to 5'-terminus of egfp under the control of the camv 35s promoter. the resulting constructs were introduced into nicotiana benthamiana following transient transformation by agroinfiltration. leaf sectors of agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana were observed  <dig> days after infiltration for gfp fluorescence by confocal microscopy . gfp fluorescence levels were comparable with the  <dig> constructions studied. control leaves expressing free gfp yielded a weak fluorescence predominantly visible in the cytoplasm . as described previously  <cit> , the atnpr1-gfp fusion protein fluorescence strongly labelled the nucleus . consistent with the presence of the nls <dig>  vvnpr <dig> -gfp and vvnpr <dig> -gfp fusion proteins were localized to the nucleus and to a lesser extent to the cytoplasm both in mesophyll and epidermal cells . localization of gfp fluorescence to nucleus was further observed in cells from peeled epidermis transiently transformed with vvnpr <dig>  . treatment of n. benthamiana leaves with sa  <dig> h before observation did not influence the localization of the fusion proteins .

transient expression of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  in n. benthamiana triggers the accumulation of acidic pr <dig> and pr <dig> but not of pr3
to investigate if vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  could control the expression of pr genes , pr protein accumulation was analyzed after transient expression of atnpr1-gfp, vvnpr <dig> -gfp and vvnpr <dig> -gfp. leaves of n. benthamiana were analyzed  <dig> days after agroinfiltration for pr protein production by western blot with anti sera raised against tobacco pr proteins. pr proteins were undetectable in untreated leaves . transient expression of atnpr1-gfp, vvnpr <dig> -gfp and vvnpr <dig> -gfp was sufficient to trigger accumulation of acidic pr <dig>  in contrast to expression of empty vector  which produced no signal . in order to determine if another marker of the sa pathway could be enhanced by vvnpr <dig> expression, the same analysis was performed to detect acidic β- <dig>  glucanase . agroinfiltration of vector alone triggered the expression of pr <dig> compared to infiltration with h2o . however, transient expression of atnpr1-gfp, vvnpr <dig> -gfp and vvnpr <dig> -gfp induced a stronger accumulation of pr <dig> compared to infiltration with empty vector . in order to determine if pr protein induction by atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig> is specific of sa signalling, we analyzed the accumulation of basic chitinase , a sa- independent marker whose expression is controlled by the ja/et pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> . anti-pr <dig> serum recognized two proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> kda corresponding to the two basic chitinase isoforms described in tobacco . similarly to pr <dig>  agroinfiltration with empty vector triggered the expression of pr <dig> compared to infiltration with h2o . however, in contrast to pr <dig> and pr <dig>  expression of atnpr1-gfp, vvnpr <dig> -gfp and vvnpr <dig> -gfp did not modify significantly pr <dig> accumulation compared to empty vector .

similar results concerning pr protein expression were observed after infiltration of n. benthamiana with agrobacterium harbouring the coding regions of atnpr <dig>  vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  under the control of the 35s camv promoter in a pbinplus vector devoid of gfp .

transient expression of atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  in grapevine leaves enhances accumulation of vvpr <dig> transcripts
heterologous expression in n. benthamiana showed that vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  were able to trigger the accumulation of acidic pr <dig> and pr <dig> in the absence of pathogen inoculation. to evaluate the effect of vvnpr <dig> expression in a homologous system , we used a recently described protocol of transient gene expression by vacuum agroinfiltration in grapevine  <cit> . atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig> , which is the most closely related to atnpr <dig>  were transiently expressed in leaves of v. vinifera cv syrah, a genotype showing high efficiency of transient expression  <cit> . gene expression was first analyzed  <dig> days after agroinfiltration. grapevine leaves were also later inoculated with p. viticola  <dig> days after agroinfiltration and analyzed  <dig> days after oomycete inoculation. to confirm that atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  were expressed in agroinfiltrated grapevine leaves, we monitored the accumulation of full length transgene-derived mrnas of atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  by rt-pcr as shown in figure  <dig>  no pcr amplification was revealed when omitting the reverse transcription step .

real time quantitative pcr was used to study the expression of vvpr <dig> and vvsts in grapevine leaves expressing atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig> ,  <dig> days after agroinfiltration. as shown in figure 7a, infiltration with empty vector stimulated the expression of vvpr <dig>  probably because of the agroinfiltration stress. interestingly, in leaves expressing atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig> , a stronger increase in vvpr <dig> transcript accumulation was measured . in contrast, no significant increase in vvsts transcript accumulation was measured in leaves expressing atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  compared to h2o-infiltrated leaves . in another experiment, we inoculated grapevine leaves with p. viticola  <dig> days after agroinfiltration and analyzed gene expression  <dig> days after inoculation. vvpr <dig> expression was induced by fungal infection as expected. consistent with the results obtained in uninoculated leaves, vvpr <dig> stimulation in infected leaves was clearly higher in leaves expressing atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  than in leaves preinfiltrated with control agrobacterium . although vvsts expression was stimulated  <dig> fold by infection, no significant effect on its expression was observed when leaves were preinfiltrated with the different constructs .

together, these results show that transient expression of both atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  in vitis vinifera is able to enhance expression of a grapevine defense gene known to be controlled by the sa signalling pathway in model plants.

discussion
in order to characterize defense response signalling components in grapevine, we identified two homologs of atnpr <dig> in vitis vinifera cv chardonnay. our study provides the first elements for the functional characterization of vvnpr <dig> 

expression studies of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  showed that these genes are constitutively expressed and that expression can be further enhanced by treatment with bth, a sa analog. induction of npr <dig> genes by treatment with sa or its analogs has been described in a number of plant species including arabidopsis, mustard, apple, rice, banana and cotton  <cit> . interestingly, vvnpr <dig>  is the most responsive to bth induction and forms a phylogenetically related group with mpnpr <dig>  atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> which are also highly induced by bth or ina  respectively  <cit> . in rice, it has been shown that osnpr <dig> is more rapidly induced in the incompatible interactions leading to resistance than in the compatible interactions leading to disease  <cit> . similarly, mnpr1a from banana was induced earlier and to higher levels after infection in a fusarium oxysporum tolerant cultivar than in a sensitive one  <cit> . to evaluate if vvnpr <dig> expression could be differentially regulated during compatible or incompatible interactions between vitis species and plasmopara viticola, we examined the expression of both genes after inoculation of susceptible vitis vinifera cv chardonnay or resistant vitis riparia cv gloire de montpellier with downy mildew. the expression of a gene encoding a stilbene synthase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of phytoalexins, which is known to be stimulated by p. viticola infection was also studied as a positive control. we detected a faster induction of sts gene expression after inoculation of the resistant genotype , consistent with an earlier induction of defense genes in incompatible versus compatible interactions  <cit> . however, no significant changes in transcript levels were detected for both vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  after infection with downy mildew. overall, the constitutive expression of vvnpr <dig> and the absence of transcriptional regulation after pathogen infection suggest that vvnpr <dig> activity is regulated at the protein level in grapevine, as previously described in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in order to address vvnpr <dig> function, particularly its subcellular localization and its ability to regulate defense gene expression, we first used an heterologous system for transient expression by agroinfiltration of n. benthamiana leaves. this method has been described as a rapid and efficient system for the in vivo analysis of plant transcription factors and promoters of pr genes  <cit> . the predicted amino acid sequences of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  were found to contain a putative nuclear localization signal  in their c terminus. consistently, transiently expressed vvnpr1-gfp and atnpr1-gfp fusion proteins were localized predominantly to the nucleus, even in the absence of the sar inducer sa. constitutive nuclear localization was also revealed by transient expression of atnpr1-gfp after bombardment of epidermal onion cells  <cit> . by contrast, in stable transformants, exclusive nuclear localization of atnpr1-gfp, which is required for activation of pr gene expression, was triggered only after treatment with a sar inducer or infection with a pathogen  <cit> . similarly, arabidopsis lines overexpressing atnpr <dig> under the control of the constitutive 35s camv promoter and grown under non-inducing conditions have not revealed an increase in the basal level of pr genes, indicating that atnpr <dig> is essentially inactive in the absence of pathogen infection. npr1-overexpressing plants will thus not activate sa-dependent defense responses until they are challenged with a pathogen  <cit> .

in this study, we showed by transient expression that vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  are functional in triggering the accumulation of acidic pr <dig> and pr <dig> in n. benthamiana. this effect was obtained in the absence of an exogenous inducer and correlated with the nuclear localization of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig> . it is likely that agroinfiltration of n. benthamiana leaves itself induces a biotic stress that activates responses related to sar, including targeting of npr <dig> proteins to the nucleus. this hypothesis is supported by a higher basal level of pr proteins in empty vector-agroinfiltrated leaves compared to leaves infiltrated with water . similarly, it has been reported that agrobacterium-mediated transient assays of stress-inducible pr promoters have relatively high levels of gus activity in water and mock-treatments  <cit> . finally, it appears that both grapevine npr <dig> are active in n. benthamiana, in agreement with the ability of atnpr <dig> to activate defense responses in other plant species such as rice and wheat  <cit> . induction of pr protein accumulation was rather specific of defense markers that have been demonstrated to be sa-specific in tobacco  <cit> . conversely, npr <dig> expression had no significant effect on basic chitinase  accumulation. in arabidopsis, pr <dig> represents an sa- independent marker whose expression is controlled by the ja/et pathway  <cit> . moreover, class i basic chitinase expression is activated by overexpression of an ethylene-responsive transcription factor  in tobacco cells  <cit> .

in order to gain further information on vvnpr <dig> activity in a homologous system, we used a recently described method of agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expression in vitis vinifera  <cit> . this system circumvents the time consuming process of generating stable transgenic lines in grapevine. in this study, we provide a first example of successful use of agrobacterium-mediated transient expression for functional analysis of signalling elements in grapevine. atnpr <dig> and vvnpr <dig>  were successfully expressed at relatively high level in leaves of v. vinifera cv syrah after agroinfiltration. transient expression of these two signalling genes resulted in increased vvpr <dig> gene expression in both uninoculated and in p. viticola inoculated leaves. in inoculated tissues, the expected stimulation of pr <dig> expression by p. viticola was observed; however, pr <dig> expression was further enhanced in infected leaves overexpressing atnpr <dig> or vvnpr <dig> . it is likely that the activity of the npr <dig> proteins is enhanced by p. viticola inoculation. moreover, it appeared that vvnpr <dig>  had a stronger activity than atnpr <dig> on induction of pr <dig> expression in grapevine.

transient expression in n. benthamiana and v. vinifera shows that vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  have a positive activity on the expression of pr <dig> and pr <dig> genes . it is thus likely that as in other plant species, vvnpr <dig> controls the expression of a set of sa-responsive defense genes in grapevine. however, it remains to be determined if vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  perform different functions in grapevine defense. arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> additional genes closely related to atnpr <dig>  which are likely involved in plant defense responses  <cit> , and  <dig> other more distant genes, atbop <dig>  and atbop <dig> , with functions in the control of growth asymmetry in leaf and floral patterning  <cit> . among nprs involved in plant defense, phylogenetic analysis revealed that atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> form a subgroup, whereas atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> form a distinct pair  <cit> . interestingly, grapevine genome sequencing revealed only two genes related to "defense" atnprs. vvnpr <dig>  belongs to the subgroup comprising atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  forms a distinct subgroup with atnpr <dig>  atnpr <dig> and mpnpr1- <dig> from apple . curiously, a hallmark of this second subgroup is a high inducibility of gene expression by bth or its analogs . different members of the atnpr family appear to mediate different functions in plant defense. atnpr <dig> has been identified as a key positive regulator of sa-dependent gene expression that is required for sar establishment as well as for basal resistance to virulent pathogens  <cit> . on the other hand, atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> have been proposed to act as negative regulators of plant defense, since the double npr3npr <dig> mutant shows elevated basal pr <dig> expression and enhanced resistance to virulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens  <cit> . however, the negative regulation of defense mechanisms by atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> is in contradiction with another study where npr <dig> single mutants were shown to be more susceptible to the virulent bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  <cit> . in this study, atnpr <dig> was also implicated in the regulation of ja-inducible genes and in the cross-talk between the sa- and the ja-dependent signalling pathways  <cit> . even if vvnpr <dig>  is closely related to atnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig>  it is likely not acting as a negative regulator of defense genes since its expression in n. benthamiana resulted in enhanced pr <dig> and pr <dig> accumulation. moreover, vvnpr <dig>  is closely related to mpnpr1- <dig>  whose overexpression led to activation of pr genes and resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens in apple  <cit>  . therefore, phylogenetic analysis is not sufficient to predict a positive or negative control of defense responses for a given member of the npr family. however, it is likely that the two npr <dig> homologs identified in grapevine do not perform fully overlapping functions. overexpression or silencing of the two genes in grapevine will help to clarify their respective role in resistance to different pathogens in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here that genome sequence resources combined with transient expression in heterologous and homologous systems allow to obtain rapidly functional information on grapevine genes. the upregulation of acidic pr <dig> and pr <dig> expression by vvnpr <dig> both in n. benthamiana and vitis vinifera strongly suggests that vvnpr <dig> is a component of the sa defense signalling pathway in grapevine. this implies the existence of highly conserved mechanisms for regulation of defense gene expression among plant species. as a consequence, overexpression of vvnpr <dig> and other signalling elements has the potential to enhance disease resistance in this crop species. further work will concentrate on the search for transcription factors interacting with the two vvnpr <dig> proteins in grapevine, and on the analysis of pathogen tolerance in npr <dig> mutant and wild type arabidopsis overexpressing vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig> .
