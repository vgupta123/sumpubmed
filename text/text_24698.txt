BACKGROUND
more than half of the human genome is composed of repetitive dna  <cit> , a proportion of which are tandem repeats. tandem repeats are characterized by a given dna sequence being repeated immediately adjacent to and in the same orientation as the first. in almost all cases the number of repeat units at a given locus vary between individuals and as such they are more commonly known as variable number tandem repeats .

macrosatellites are among the largest vntrs in the human genome  <cit>  and are characterized by individual repeat units of several kilobases  and tend to be specific to a location on one or two chromosomes. among the human macrosatellites, the best characterized are rs <dig>  an array of 20- <dig>  <dig>  kb tandem repeat units on 4p <dig>  along with a few copies at 8p <dig>  <cit> , d4z <dig> on 4q <dig> and 10q <dig>  an array of as few as  <dig> to over  <dig>  <dig>  kb tandem repeat units  <cit>  and dxz <dig>  an array of 50- <dig> copies of a 3-kb repeat unit specifically located at xq23- <dig>  <cit> . the role of some tandem repeat dna is more obvious due to their location, such as the extensive alpha satellite tandem repeats that define human centromeres  <cit>  or the tandem repeat dna at human telomeres  <cit> . what function macrosatellites have in genome biology is unclear. however, reduction in the size of d4z <dig> on 4q <dig> to fewer than  <dig> tandem repeat units is associated with onset of the third most common inherited form of muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy   <cit> . numerous models have been proposed to explain how d4z <dig> contraction could result in fshd  <cit> . one early model suggested that reduction in the size of d4z <dig> packaged as heterochromatin could result in a position-effect on adjacent gene expression  <cit> . results from several studies testing this model are mixed, with some showing support  <cit> , and others not  <cit> . more recently focus has turned to expression of the array itself. like rs <dig>  that contains an open reading frame  in each monomer that codes for a novel deubiquitinating enzyme  <cit> , an orf is present in d4z <dig> monomers that encodes double homeobox  <dig>   <cit> , a dna binding protein  <cit>  that alters expression levels of myogenic regulators in myoblasts  <cit> . dux <dig> expression can be detected in patient myoblasts  <cit>  but not control individuals. recent evidence suggests that detectable levels of dux <dig> in patients is due to polyadenylation and stabilization of transcripts originating from the most distal monomer in the array due to a polyadenylation signal located immediately distal to the array  <cit> , a feature that is found only on chromosomes with the fshd pathogenic 4qa <dig> haplotype  <cit> .

the x-linked macrosatellite dxz <dig> is also expressed  <cit>  and contains several short orfs  <cit> , but none show any homology to known proteins. unlike rs <dig> and d4z <dig>  the location of dxz <dig> on the x chromosome means that in females it is exposed to the mammalian dosage compensation process x chromosome inactivation . xci repackages the chosen inactive x chromosome  into facultative heterochromatin  <cit> . somewhat counter intuitively, dxz <dig> adopts a more euchromatic conformation on the xi while the surrounding chromosome is packaged into heterochromatin, whereas on the active x chromosome  dxz <dig> is packaged into heterochromatin surrounded by euchromatin  <cit> . the euchromatic xi form of dxz <dig> is bound by the epigenetic organizer protein ctcf  <cit>  suggesting that on the xi, dxz <dig> is performing a different function than on the xa. intriguingly, contracted d4z <dig> arrays in fshd adopt a chromatin configuration similar to dxz <dig> on the xi  <cit>  including the binding of ctcf  <cit>  that likely contributes to the disease permissive state.

these data suggest that tandem repeat copy number, chromatin organization and expression are important features of macrosatellites, and provide some insight into functional attributes of these sequence, in particular the impact of short arrays in fshd. indeed, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, retention of large rdna tandem repeats are necessary for sister chromatid cohesion and maintenance of genome integrity  <cit> . therefore exploring macrosatellite vntr and organization in the human genome is a high priority. in the current manuscript we describe the organization, expression, tandem repeat copy number polymorphism and stability of four macrosatellite arrays in the human genome.

RESULTS
characterization of the taf11-like macrosatellite array on chromosome 5p15
in order to identify novel human macrosatellite arrays, the ucsc genome browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/ was used with the segmental duplication annotation activated to explore by eye the complete human genome sequence . the segmental duplication track identifies duplications of  <dig> kb or greater that share 90% or more dna sequence identity  <cit> . regions annotated as segmental duplications that originate from the same chromosomal interval and displayed a regular repeat masking pattern were selected for further examination. these rough criteria were chosen based on the fact that the well characterized macrosatellite arrays dxz <dig>  d4z <dig> and rs <dig> were clearly identified using the same parameters.

one tandem array that spans ~ <dig> kb  was identified on the short arm of human chromosome  <dig> at 5p <dig> . the closest annotated gene to the 5p <dig>  macrosatellite repeat is basp <dig>  located approximately  <dig> kb distal to the array . on the proximal side, the nearest annotated gene cdh <dig>  is located over  <dig>  mb away. a cluster of expressed sequence tags  represented by bc <dig>  resides approximately  <dig> kb proximal to the array with some est members as close as  <dig> kb.

an individual repeat unit of the array is approximately  <dig>  kb and is defined by a bglii restriction enzyme recognition site that cuts once per monomer . monomers within the contiguous array share between  <dig> - <dig> % nucleotide identity based on blat alignment results http://genome.ucsc.edu using monomers from genome build hg <dig>  with most variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms  between monomers. the base composition of each monomer is approximately  <dig> % gc and a little under a third  of each monomer is repeat masked due to a combination of a retrotransposon ltr , partial alu repeat  and a disrupted dna transposon . a short open reading frame  resides within each monomer spanning  <dig> bp, and encodes a predicted tata binding protein associated factor  <dig> like protein . three snps reside within the orf in the different monomer sequences represented in the hg <dig> build. none introduce any frame shifts or premature stop codons and therefore maintain the reading frame of the orf. one snp is silent exchanging a glycine codon for another . the other two snps result in an amino acid change: a t-g at nucleotide  <dig> changing tcc to gcc and consequently a seriene to alanine , and a a-g at nucleotide  <dig> changing a aaa to an aga resulting in a lysine to arginine change .

a comparison of the orf nucleotide sequence against entries in the nucleotide collection database using blast http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi identified a conserved sequence in primates. translation of these sequences  reveals a conserved orf of  <dig> amino acids in great apes  and  <dig> amino acids in macaque . of note, amino acid  <dig> in the human orf that is either an alanine or seriene based on the snps described above is an alanine in all the primates examined. likewise, the snp that results in either an arginine or lysine at amino acid  <dig> is a lysine in the great apes, but a glycine in macaque. however, until greater sequence coverage of the taf11-like array is achieved in all primates, the significance of these coding snps cannot be readily assessed at this time. a comparison of the taf11-like nucleotide sequence against the genomes of each primate revealed for all a tandem array located within a region of synteny to human 5p <dig> that is in the vicinity of basp <dig>  and therefore likely identifying the orthologous primate macrosatellite arrays.

copy number variation, meiotic and mitotic instability of the taf11-like macrosatellite array
assembly of large tandem repeat dna sequence is problematic for in silico assembly, in particular the challenge of whether to align two identical sequences as the same or separate given that in vivo they may actually be immediately adjacent to one another. according to the current dna assembly, the array is largely composed of  <dig> monomers arranged in tandem, with  <dig> complete monomers inverted at the distal edge relative to the main array. fragments of monomers can also be found several kb away from the immediate edges of the array . to investigate the copy number variation of the taf11-like array, genomic dna from  <dig> unrelated individuals was embedded in agarose plugs and subjected to digestion with xbai which does not have any recognition sites within any complete monomers, but is predicted to cut immediately flanking the main array . the dna fragments were separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and southern blotted dna hybridized with a probe specific to the array . the size of the hybridizing bands ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb indicating that the size of the taf11-like array is very polymorphic in the general population . because an individual monomer is approximately  <dig>  kb, these data would indicate that as few as  <dig> and as many as  <dig> tandem copies of a monomer can be present at an array, a range comparable to that seen for the chromosome  <dig> macrosatellite array d4z <dig> 

primers used in the current study to amplify the macrosatellites listed for probe generation or assessment of expression by rt-pcr analysis.

given the polymorphic nature of the taf11-like array, we investigated the stability of the array through meiosis and mitosis by monitoring mendelian inheritance of alleles of the array through three generations in three independent ceph families . whereas most individuals inherited arrays that were the same size as those of their parents, one individual acquired an allele approximately two repeat units smaller than siblings inheriting the same allele  suggesting meiotic instability. a second individual showed the appearance of a new smaller allele as well as retaining the parental allele , indicative of somatic instability of the array. to rule out possible contamination of the  <dig> cell line with cells from an unrelated individual, alleles of other macrosatellites were assessed on the same blot. in each case,  <dig> alleles were consistent with the parents and no additional bands were detected .

expression of the taf11-like array
given the conserved orf  and similarity to taf <dig>  reverse transcription pcr  was performed on a panel of complementary dna  prepared from total rna isolated from  <dig> human tissues. most tissues did not show evidence of taf11-like expression with the notable exception of testis, fetal brain and whole brain . weaker signals could also be detected in fetal liver and prostate.

characterization of the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> sst <dig> macrosatellites
along with the taf11-like array, a macrosatellite was identified on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> . this array was previously reported as a moderately repetitive tandem array that was initially identified as a repetitive sequence with homology to adenovirus  <cit> . the repeat was named sst <dig> due to the restriction enzyme ssti cutting once per monomer generating a common  <dig>  kb fragment on southern hybridization. on chromosome  <dig> the sst <dig> array resides within a gene poor region of 4q <dig>  with the nearest annotated flanking genes being pcdh <dig>  <dig>  mb distal to the array and c4orf <dig> approximately  <dig> mb proximal. the array is composed of  <dig> kb monomers in tandem with one partial monomer inverted and  <dig> kb distal to the main array . each monomer is moderately gc rich  and contains a cpg island  of about  <dig> bp. with the exception of a few simple repeats accounting for less than 5% of a monomer, the remaining sequence does not contain any other repetitive elements. a comparison of the  <dig> -kb sequence to entries in the public databases primarily indentifies other chromosome  <dig> monomers  as well as monomers from the chromosome  <dig> arrays . other matches of >90% over  <dig>  kb were identified on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> . in the current dna assembly, the chromosome  <dig> sst <dig> array is represented by  <dig> uninterrupted  <dig>  kb monomers therefore covering approximately  <dig> kb .

chromosome  <dig> contains two sst <dig> arrays separated by approximately  <dig> mb with several partial monomers scattered either side of the more distal array . unlike the chromosome  <dig> array, on chromosome  <dig> the two sst <dig> macrosatellites are embedded within a gene rich region of 19q <dig> . intriguingly, most of the genes encode members of the kruppel c2h2-type zinc-finger protein family with two genes proximal, sixteen between and eleven distal of the two sst <dig> macrosatellites. monomers of the chromosome  <dig> sst <dig> arrays are slightly longer than those at chromosome  <dig> . within the proximal or distal chromosome  <dig> array monomers share >99% sequence identity compared to 97-98% identity between the two arrays based on blat results using a single monomer from each array. the orientations of the two arrays are inverted relative to one another and are represented by  <dig>  and  <dig> monomers  arranged in tandem .

copy number variation and instability of the sst <dig> macrosatellite arrays
to investigate copy number variation of monomers within the sst <dig> macrosatellite arrays, agarose embedded dna from  <dig> unrelated individuals was digested with xbai that does not cut within the array and separated by pfge before southern blotting and hybridization with a probe specific to the sst <dig> arrays. given the high sequence identity between the three arrays, the probe detected both chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> sst <dig> macrosatellites with most individuals showing all  <dig> alleles . alleles ranged from as large as  <dig> kb to less than  <dig> kb indicating tandem arrays of between  <dig> to  <dig> monomers. in order to determine if large and small alleles are common to both chromosome  <dig> and/or chromosome  <dig> sst <dig> macrosatellite arrays, pfge was performed on agarose embedded dna digested with enzymes that specifically cut each monomer within the chromosome  <dig> array  or chromosome  <dig> arrays  . specifically removing the chromosome  <dig> arrays with pvuii resulted in small alleles only, whereas most large alleles remained intact and comparable in size upon digestion with apali that specifically removes the chromosome  <dig> arrays . these data suggest that large sst <dig> arrays are more common on chromosome  <dig> than chromosome  <dig> 

given the large range of allele sizes for the sst <dig> arrays, we next investigated stability of transmission of alleles through three generations in two ceph families . in one individual , two new alleles of approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb can be detected that are not present in either parent. the larger of the two alleles was stably transmitted through the germ line to three offspring, whereas the smaller allele was not detected.

expression of the sst <dig> array
according to the ucsc genome browser, a cluster of ests match a monomer centered upon the cgi. primers were designed to amplify across the cgi and were used to detect expression from the sst <dig> macrosatellite using cdna prepared from  <dig> human tissues. expression was readily detected in all tissues . several open reading frames exist within chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> monomers, but none match any known proteins in the public databases.

characterization of the prr <dig> macrosatellite on chromosome 13
a third candidate macrosatellite array was detected at chromosome 13q <dig> . the array resides within a gene poor region with the nearest annotated gene  <dig> kb distal  and over  <dig> mb proximal . an individual tandem repeat unit is  <dig>  kb, is approximately 50% gc and 43% repeat masked for line, alu and a simple repeat. two cgis reside within a single monomer covering  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. each monomer contains the proline-rich- <dig> gene . the gene is composed of three exons of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp and encodes a  <dig> amino acid proline rich protein. rt-pcr analysis indicates that prr <dig> is primarily expressed in the testis with low levels of transcript detected in cerebellum, fetal brain, prostate and thymus . orthologous copies of prr <dig> were identified in great apes and macaca mulatta that encode prr <dig> proteins that have 95-71% amino acid identity  with human prr <dig> . furthermore, in the great apes, prr <dig> is arranged into a tandem array as seen in humans, with at least one complete orangutan  bac clone  containing  <dig> copies of the gene arranged in tandem . of the five complete human prr <dig> monomers present in the human genome, no snps exist within the orf between the different monomers.

according to the human genome sequence, the five complete monomers are arranged in tandem . we sought to confirm the size of the array and investigate copy number variation in  <dig> unrelated individuals. alleles for the prr <dig> array ranged from  <dig> tandem copies to as many as  <dig>  indicating that this is indeed a polymorphic macrosatellite.

characterization of the zav macrosatellite array on human chromosome 9q32
one other macrosatellite candidate identified in our search resides within a moderately gene rich region of human chromosome 9q <dig> . the closest gene is zfp <dig>  a member of the krab zinc finger gene family that is located immediately adjacent to the array within  <dig> kb of the proximal edge and is transcribed away from the array. on the distal side the nearest annotated gene is slc31a <dig> which is  <dig> kb away from the edge of the array. between the array and slc31a <dig> is an inverted repeat that transcribes a non-coding rna of unknown function. a similar inverted repeat is present upstream of the mouse zfp <dig> gene on chromosome 4qb <dig>  but there is no evidence of the tandem array suggesting that this genomic feature is a more recent acquisition in humans .

each tandem repeat unit of the array is  <dig>  kb and 60% gc. a little over 28% of each monomer is repeat masked due to the presence of simple microsatellite repeats, an ltr and regions of line homology. two cgis are found in each repeat unit, one spanning  <dig>  kb and the other close to  <dig> bp. therefore almost 40% of each monomer, accounting for most of the non-repeat masked region, is a characterized by a cgi. in the current build of the human genome, the array is annotated as  <dig> repeat units arranged in tandem . as for the other arrays we examined  <dig> unrelated individuals to see if the array was polymorphic. alleles for the array ranged from as small as  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb  indicating that this is indeed a macrosatellite repeat with between 3- <dig> tandem repeat units and was termed the zfp37-associated vntr .

one est aligned with the larger of the two cgis. we designed primers to this region and looked to see if the array is expressed in any of the  <dig> human tissue cdna samples. clearly the zav array is expressed in fetal brain and testis, with weaker signals in whole brain, thymus, uterus and spinal cord .

discussion
here we describe the organization, size variation and expression of four macrosatellite arrays in the human genome that is summarized in table  <dig>  consistent with other macrosatellite arrays  <cit>  alleles of each array show a wide range of tandem repeat unit copy number variation, with the chromosome  <dig> sst <dig> macrosatellite displaying alleles with the largest number of tandem repeat units described to date for a human macrosatellite. also consistent with data for the rs <dig> macrosatellite  <cit>  we present evidence of meiotic and mitotic instability for the sst <dig> and taf11-like arrays in a relatively small sample size. of note, the chromosome 9q <dig> zav macrosatellite described here and the rs <dig> array reside within common fragile sites in the human genome  <cit>  and could potentially contribute to chromosome breaks and rearrangements frequently observed in tumor cells. taken together, these data are consistent with the reported instability of macrosatellite sequences and further highlight their contribution as extreme forms of copy number variation in the human genome.

table summarizing features of the macrosatellite arrays

among the macrosatellites described here, the sst <dig> array is the only one that is not chromosome specific, but has arrays of significant size  <dig> mb apart on 19q <dig>  and an additional highly conserved array on chromosome 4q <dig>   <cit> . a similar situation is true for the fshd-associated array d4z <dig> that has near identical arrays on chromosomes 4q <dig> and 10q <dig>  exchange between the 4q and 10q d4z <dig> arrays is common in the general population  <cit> . the subtelomeric location of the arrays results only in the expansion or contraction of an array as well as exchange of the limited dna sequence from the distal edge of the array to the telomere. should the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> sst <dig> arrays recombine this would result in an extensive exchange. while we are aware of no such chromosome 4: <dig> translocations, it remains a distinct possibility that the two inverted chromosome 19q <dig> sst <dig> arrays could undergo intra-chromosomal non-allelic homologous recombination inverting the  <dig> mb interval between the arrays, especially given the extensive size and >97% sequence identity between the two macrosatellite arrays.

an independent investigation using array comparative genome hybridization identified contracted alleles of the taf11-like array as a possible contributor to schizophrenia  <cit> . in one group of families, small alleles  segregated with schizophrenia with only one unaffected sibling carrying a small sized allele. however, this association did not extend to other schizophrenia families and therefore linkage of small taf11-like arrays to the disease is not statistically significant. interestingly, the extended analysis to other schizophrenia families made use of quantitative pcr  as opposed to pfge to assess allele size. as the authors acknowledge, the results therefore represent the combined tandem repeat content of both chromosome  <dig> arrays, potentially masking small alleles. in the present study we also identified small alleles of the taf11-like array, with the smallest  comparable in size to the pathogenic contracted d4z <dig> alleles in fshd  <cit> . for these particular individuals, who have alleles of  <dig> and  <dig> tandem repeats, qpcr would have indicated approximately  <dig> tandem repeat units in each chromosome  <dig> array. this highlights that despite numerous advances in genome research tools, pfge remains the most effective and reliable means to measure allele size of tandem repeat dna.

expression analysis of the four macrosatellite described here revealed that all of the arrays are expressed at high levels in the testis and to a lesser extent in fetal brain and in adult brain . the notable exception is sst <dig> that is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined. furthermore, expression was independent of a clear orf as demonstrated by the sst <dig> and zav macrosatellites, although it remains a possibility that either has a short orf with no homology to known proteins. expression in the testis is a defining feature of the cancer/testis  genes  <cit> , many of which are arranged into tandem arrays  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the zav, prr <dig> or taf11-like macrosatellites are novel members of the cancer/testis group, as some ct-genes are expressed in developing neurons as well as testis  <cit> . regardless, the strong expression in testis indicates that these arrays are likely packaged into an alternate chromatin state in this organ, most likely in the germ cells, as is the case for some mage and gage ct genes  <cit> .

what influence variation in the number of copies of individual tandem repeat units has, if any, on flanking gene expression remains an important question to be addressed, despite the conflicting data regarding d4z <dig>  <cit> . for some such as the chromosome  <dig> sst <dig> array or the prr <dig> array on chromosome 13q <dig>  any influence is likely negligible given that the nearest annotated genes are considerable physical distances away. the taf11-like array is also some distance from the distal basp <dig> gene  and therefore is also unlikely to exert any influence on its expression. however, this is making the assumption that influence is 2-dimensional and does not take into account where in 3-dimensional space the arrays are located relative to other genes. in contrast, the 9q <dig> zav array and sst <dig> arrays at 19q <dig>  could conceivably directly influence flanking gene expression. the zav array is approximately  <dig> kb from the proximal zfp <dig> gene is composed of gc rich tandem repeat units that each contain two extensive cgis. evidence supporting such a notion comes from the fact that the murine homolog zfp- <dig> is expressed specifically in the brain and testis  <cit> , mirroring the human array expression pattern. therefore, it is tempting to posit that the array in humans is an extensive regulatory element of the zfp <dig> gene. the location of the chromosome  <dig> sst <dig> arrays are intriguing due to the presence of the  <dig> zinc-finger genes that reside between and immediately proximal/distal of the two macrosatellites. of the approximately  <dig> zinc-finger genes in the human genome, a disproportionate number reside on chromosome  <dig>  with most residing in one of  <dig> clusters  <cit> . this is not the only kruppel-type zinc finger cluster on chromosome  <dig> that is associated with tandem repeat dna, as an extensive cluster at 19p <dig> is interspersed with blocks of β-satellite  <cit> . kruppel-type zinc fingers are implicated in transcriptional regulation of many crucial processes from development to control of the cell cycle to pluripotency  <cit> . despite their close proximity, zinc finger genes within a cluster are differentially expressed  <cit>  and therefore intricate modes of regulation must be required to tightly regulate the expression of cluster members. we propose that the sst <dig> array at 19q <dig>  has a role in the regulation of the surrounding zinc finger gene cluster.

CONCLUSIONS
the wealth of information made available from the human genome project has provided an invaluable tool to assist in the identification and characterization of complex repetitive dna elements such as the macrosatellites. our results more than double the number of characterized macrosatellite arrays in the human genome and further highlight our lack of understanding as to the role of these unusual sequences in genome biology despite their direct relevance to disease. we anticipate that further characterization of these arrays will reveal the functional significance of macrosatellites arrays, explaining why they are retained in our genome.
