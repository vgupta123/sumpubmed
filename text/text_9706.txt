BACKGROUND
using near-infrared spectroscopy , many recent studies have explored brain activities underlying face recognition in infants  <cit> . these studies have revealed infants’ brain activation patterns during the presentation of upright and inverted faces  <cit> , facial expressions  <cit> , frontal and profile views  <cit> , mother’s face and unfamiliar female faces  <cit> , arcimboldo images  <cit> , and directed and averted gaze  <cit> . these studies suggest that face stimuli evoke cortical activation in infants’ bilateral temporal areas.

to examine which facial information is processed in infants’ temporal areas, we have applied the neural adaptation technique to infant nirs measurement  <cit> . the technique of neural-adaptation has been established in adult neuroimaging studies, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging , as a tool for investigating the functional properties and representations processed in particular neural populations. neural-adaptation refers to the attenuation of brain activation by the repeated presentation of an identical stimulus compared to that of different stimuli, e.g.  <cit> . by measuring the recovery from adaptation when some stimulus property is altered, the nature of representation in a specific cortical area can be assessed. at first, we examined whether lower hemodynamic responses occurred for an identical face than for different faces  <cit> . results showed that infants aged  <dig> to 8 months showed an attenuated hemodynamic response  to the identical face. we revealed that such adaptation is also observed in 5- to 8-month-olds when the sizes of the faces were changed  <cit> . in contrast, when the faces were presented from multiple viewpoints, only 7- to 8-month-olds, but not 5- to 6-month-olds, showed the adaptation  <cit> . these previous studies suggest that  infants’ temporal areas process facial identity in a size-invariant manner at 5 months of age,  the ability to process facial identity in a view-invariant manner develops around 7 months of age.

in the present study, we investigated image-invariant recognition of faces by infants for face changes associated with non-rigid facial movement. facial movement can be categorized into two different types: rigid movement and non-rigid movement. rigid movement is the rotation of the head, which provides a different view of the face  <cit> . non-rigid motion is the movement of the internal facial features, which provides visual information relating to facial expressions, eye gaze changes and speech  <cit> . as noted above, our previous nirs-adaptation study already examined the processing of facial identity across changes with rigid movement and revealed that the ability to process facial identity develops around 7 months of age  <cit> . here, we focused on the processing of facial identity in 5- to 8-month-olds’ temporal areas across changes of facial features associated with non-rigid movement.

ichikawa et al.  <cit>  created point-light displays  depicting faces with dynamic facial expression. they measured infants’ brain activity as the infants viewed upright and inverted versions of the plds. they found increased brain activation for the upright plds in 7- to 8-month-olds’ temporal areas, suggesting not only that biological motion enhanced infants’ hemodynamic response to faces, but also that the infants recognized the faces from only the facial movement depicted by the plds. their results can be interpreted as showing that infants aged around 7 months process facial expression through non-rigid facial movement. we used nirs to investigate whether 5- to 8-month-old infants process facial identity from faces across non-rigid facial change. we postulated that if infants could process the invariance of facial identity across non-rigid facial change, they would show an attenuation of oxy-hb concentration  to the presentation of an identical face rather than different faces, even across non-rigid facial change as in our previous studies  <cit> .

RESULTS
we obtained hemodynamic responses from twelve 5- to 6-month-olds and twelve 7- to 8-month-olds who looked at the stimuli for more than three trials in both the same-face and different-face conditions. the mean number of valid trials was  <dig>   for the different-face condition and  <dig>   for the same-face condition in 5- to 6-month-olds, and  <dig>   for the different-face condition and  <dig>   for the same-face condition for 7- to 8-month-olds. as we could successfully establish a sufficient contact between the optical fibers and the skull for all  <dig> channels for all twenty-four infants mentioned above, data from all channels were included in the analysis. to investigate the possibility that infants had habituated to the faces through repeated presentation across trials during the course of experiment, we compared infants’ looking time between the first and the last trial for both conditions by an anova with three factors: age of groups , condition , and trial . as a result, we did not find any main effects  =  <dig> , p = .31; condition f =  <dig> , p = .18; trial f =  <dig> , p = .34) or interaction  =  <dig> , p = .88; age × trial f =  <dig> , p = .34; condition × trial f =  <dig> , p = .20; age × condition × trial f =  <dig> , p = .67), suggesting no significant differences in looking time, which argue against the possibility that infants had habituated to the faces during this experiment.

figure  <dig> shows the time course of the average oxy-hb concentration in the bilateral temporal areas obtained from  <dig> channels for each hemisphere under the different-face condition  and same-face condition . in 7- to 8-month-olds, increases of oxy-hb concentration in the different-face condition occurred at about 3 s after the beginning of the test trial, and the decrease occurred after the end of the test trial . in contrast to the oxy-hb changes, the deoxy-hb changes in both temporal areas increased in the same-face condition rather than the different-face condition. 5- to 6-month-olds did not show any changes in either condition compared to the baseline .

developmental changes in facial identity processing across non-rigid facial changes?
a repeated-measures anova with age  as a between-subject factor, and condition  and measurement area  as the within-subject factor, was separately performed on the average z-score of oxy- and deoxy-hb from 3 s to 7 s of the test trial in each temporal area . this analysis revealed a significant interaction between age and condition for oxy-hb  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η2 = .53). according to multiple comparisons, the oxy-hb concentration in the different-face condition was significantly higher than that of the same-face condition for the older group  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η2 = .92). no main effect or other interaction reached statistical significance . for deoxy-hb, the interaction between age and condition was also significant  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η2 = .48). multiple comparisons revealed that deoxy-hb in the 7- to 8-month-olds significantly differed between the two conditions  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η2 = .45). no main effect or other interaction reached statistical significance .

the channels showing increased hemodynamic responses to faces
to examine the possibility that there was differential activity for the presentation of faces compared to the baseline, we performed a two-tailed one-sample t-test on the z-scores against a chance level of  <dig> for each age group separately. the analysis revealed that in 7- to 8-month-olds, the concentration of oxy-hb increased significantly in both the left and right temporal areas during the different-face condition  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  r = . <dig>  95% ci , right: t =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  r = . <dig>  95% ci ), but not during the same-face condition . in contrast to the 7- to 8-month-olds, no significant change in the concentration of oxy-hb was found during the different-face or same-face conditions in the 5- to 6-month-olds . for deoxy-hb changes, deoxy-hb in the 5- to 6-month-olds significantly decreased only in the same-face condition in the right temporal area  = - <dig> , p < . <dig>  r = . <dig>  95% ci ).

in the 7- to 8-month-olds,  <dig> channels around the t <dig> and t <dig> positions showed significant increases in oxy-hb in the different-face condition from the object baseline, but not in the same-face condition . in contrast, no significant change was found in either the same-face or the different-face condition in 5- to 6-month-olds . these seven channels  were selected as coi . a repeated-measure anova with two factors, condition  and channel , was performed on the data of oxy-, deoxy-hb in the coi region. this analysis revealed a significant effect of condition only for oxy-hb  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η2 =  <dig> ). the main effect of channel  and interaction  were not significant.

discussion
the current study used the nirs-adaptation paradigm to investigate the development of infants’ processing of facial identity across non-rigid facial transformation. we compared brain activation in the bilateral temporal areas between the presentation of multiple faces  and an identical face , both transformed non-rigidly by showing different facial gestures. we found that despite the non-rigid facial change, hemoglobin changes in channels around the t <dig> and t <dig> positions were significantly lower for the same-face condition than for the different-face condition only in 7- to 8-momth-olds.

the current study suggests that infants’ processing of facial identity across non-rigid facial changes develops around 7 months of age. the pattern of results we obtained in infants’ bilateral temporal region is consistent with those obtained in the fusiform face area  of adults in previous studies  <cit> . however, this does not necessarily imply that our results reflect activity in infants’ ffa. given that nirs can record the hemodynamic responses only in the superficial layers of the cortex, the adaptation we showed in the present study might reflect activation not in the ffa, but in the superior temporal sulcus   <cit> .

previous behavioral study has reported that 3- to 4-month-old infants could learn a facial identity from a movie showing non-rigid facial motion and recognize the face in expressions that differed from the learned facial image  <cit> . for infants’ sensitivity to non-rigid facial transformation, erp studies reported the ability to discriminate between an angry facial expression and a neutral expression in infants aged around 7 months  <cit> . infants’ sensitivity to rigid changes of face have been also reported in behavioral  <cit>  and neuroimaging studies  <cit> . previous studies reported that infants’ ability to recognize face across different views was shown even in newborn infants  <cit>  and becomes more robust at around 8 months after birth  <cit> . consistent with these behavioural findings, the same activity between frontal and side-view faces was reported in 8-month-old infants, not but in 5-month-old infants  <cit> . taken together, the results of these previous studies and the present study suggest that 7- to 8-month-olds develop the ability to process not only information of facial transformation, but also facial identity across the facial transformation.

the stimuli in the current study consisted of images from only five individual faces. as the images of five faces were repeatedly shown during the experiment, this might have caused attenuation in the hemodynamic responses over the course of the trials. to examine this possibility, we compared the oxy-hb changes in the same-face and different-face conditions between the first and last trials by an anova with three factors: hemisphere , condition  and trial . as a result, we found no main effect and any interaction in either 5- to 6-month-olds  or 7- to 8-month-olds . this result suggests that increased oxy-hb concentration for the different-face condition occurred throughout the experiment in 7- to 8-month-olds, while 5- to 6-month-olds showed no changes throughout the experiment.

in the current study, 5- to 6-month-olds did not show increases in oxy-hb concentration in either the different-face or same-face condition. considering previous behavioral findings that even 5-month-olds had the ability to process changes of the internal features of face  <cit> , we predicted that 5- to 6-month-olds would show increases for both conditions. the pattern of younger infants’ hemodynamic responses in this study suggests differences between behavioral responses and neuroimaging responses. although 5-month-olds can process changes of the internal features of face, this process might not be reflected in neural responses  <cit> . the 5- to 6-month-olds’ hemodynamic responses in this study are in accordance with those of our previous adaptation study examining view-invariant face processing  <cit> .

inconsistent results between this study and previous behavioral studies might also result from a difference in learning time. in this study, infants were required to recognize faces without a prior learning phase. in contrast, previous behavioral studies  <cit>  used an infant-controlled habituation procedure in which infants were given considerable time to learn the faces before the recognition test. taken together, these studies suggest that infants aged  <dig> to 6 months needed sufficient learning time to process the internal features of faces. our results with the 5- to 6-month-olds did not necessarily show that 5- to 6-month-olds lack the ability to process changes in internal facial features.

a series of our adaptation studies  have suggested that infants’ temporal areas are involved in the processing of facial identity. the size of adaptation, as indexed by the difference in activity between different-face and same-face conditions, was similar to that of our previous study for rigid facial change   <cit>  and to that of the present study for non-rigid facial change . a two-way anova on the size of adaptation with hemisphere  and condition  revealed no difference between the two studies . thus, our results for small adaptation in the different-face condition did not stem from the variation of faces, e.g., the shape or location of facial features. we also have revealed that 1) the processing of facial identity invariant to size change emerges before 5 months of age, and 2) the processing of facial identity across the change, along with rigid and non-rigid facial movement, develops around 7 months of age. by applying the neural adaptation paradigm established in fmri study to nirs measurement in infancy, we obtained the first evidence that the processing of facial identity in the bilateral temporal areas develops from a low level to a higher level by 8 months of age.

CONCLUSIONS
using the nirs-adaptation paradigm, the current study investigated the development of facial identity processing in 5- to 8-month-old infants for non-rigid transforming facial features. we focused on whether attenuated hemodynamic response  occurred in infants’ temporal areas for an identical face rather than for different faces. as predicted, 7- to 8-month-old infants showed the adaptation for the presentation of the same face, while 5- to 6-month-old infants did not. this result suggests that the ability to process facial identity across non-rigid facial changes develops around 7 months after birth.
