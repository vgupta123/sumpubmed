BACKGROUND
herbivore feeding is a complex process that includes wounding, defoliation, and bsa deposition  <cit> . often, the leaves of a plant are completely or partially removed, affecting the photosynthetic activity, secondary metabolism, and carbohydrate relocation of plants . many reports have focused on stress-induced gene expression, photosynthetic capacity, root growth, and nutrient uptake after wounding and defoliation . resistance to herbivores depends largely upon aboveground portion of plants and on leaf-to-leaf wound signaling, which may involve electrical signaling  <cit> . the propagation of electrical activity leads to the expression of defense genes not only in wounded leaves but also throughout aboveground portion of plants.

animal saliva deposited on plants  is another important factor affecting plant recovery after grazing. in  <dig>  vittora and rendina first proposed that interactions between grazers and plants involve the deposition of herbivore saliva during grazing. this hypothesis has since been tested . to date, many studies of large-herbivore bsa deposition have focused on macroscopic changes in plants, such as biomass accumulation, tiller, and increased bud initiation after grazing  <cit> , rather than on changes in gene expression and plant physiology. on the other hand, many growth regulators in insect salivary systems have been fully researched, such as glucose oxidase, β-glucosidase  <cit> , and various growth factors in certain mammalian submaxillary glands , including thiamine  <cit> , nerve growth factor , transforming growth factor , and epidermal growth factor   <cit> , are known to have growth-regulating activity. growth factors can intervene directly in cellular metabolism by promoting differential gene expression and are expected to be active in a variety of organisms  <cit> . injecting growth-promoting substances from grasshopper saliva into bouteloua gracilis stimulates tiller production  <cit> . mouse and human egf can enhance plant growth rates and promote cell division in the epicotyl  <cit> . however, to date, no study has reported the effects of bsa deposition by large herbivores such as cows, sheep, and camels.

gene-expression profiling or transcriptome analysis can provide new insights to understand the molecular mechanism of grazing responses in plants. high-throughput next-generation sequencing  technologies, such as  <dig> , solexa , and solid , have been widely and effectively used to generate large-scale transcriptome data in many plant species , including sheepgrass   <cit> . sheepgrass is an important forage species in the genus of leymus, with good quality, high nutrition value, and various stress resistance . its genomic formula was nsnsxmxm and elymus californicus should be the maternal donor transferred from the genus elymus to leymus
 <cit> . one copy of the haploid genome of sheepgrass contains  <dig> -gb, and high-throughput ngs technologies make it possible to generate genome resources at relatively low cost. so far, sheepgrass transcriptome databases have been generated under saline-alkaline treatment  <cit>  and freezing treatment  <cit>  using roche- <dig> massive pyrosequencing technology. these databases provide numerous degs for two stresses. recently, a comparative transcriptomics analysis of the illumina sequencing data was conducted, and the results revealed common and distinct mechanisms for sheepgrass responses to defoliation compared to mechanical wounding  <cit> . based these transcriptome databases, some grazing responsive genes were cloned and identified, such as lcsut <dig> and lcdreb3
 <cit> .

here, we focus on profiling the effects of herbivore saliva on sheepgrass and distinguishing bsa deposition from defoliation in grazing. in our study, we use bovine serum albumin  instead of bovine saliva to perform the grazing simulation treatment. the components of herbivore saliva are unstable and it usually contains bacterium. bsa is an important protein in bovine saliva. its homolog has been found in ovine saliva and probably has interactions with plants  <cit> . in our study, in order to enrich sheepgrass transcriptome resource, accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of grazing stress, we used illumina gaiix technology to sequence sheepgrass transcriptome after defoliation and grazing. we compared defoliation and grazing treatments, and identified the differentially expressed genes  responding to bsa deposition and corresponding pathways involved in saliva effects. we performed further biochemical and morphological experiments to verify these results in transcriptome.

to further evaluate the completeness of the de novo transcriptome assembly and to predict the gene functions, all assembled transcripts were compared against the eukaryotic orthologous groups  database. this comparison revealed  <dig>  sequences with significant homology, each of which was assigned to the appropriate kog cluster. these kog classifications were grouped into  <dig> functional categories . the five largest categories were “signal-transduction mechanisms” , “general function prediction only” , “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” , “translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis” , and “intracellular trafficking, secretion and catabolism” .figure  <dig>

the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  is a database resource for the systematic understanding of high-level gene functions in terms of biological networks, such as the cell, organism, and ecosystem, from molecular-level information . the assembled transcripts were searched against the kegg database using blastx with a cut-off e-value of 10− <dig> to identify the biological pathways related to grazing responses in sheepgrass. we obtained  <dig>  matching terms, which were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways in  <dig> main biological processes. the major pathways were “biosynthesis of amino acids” , “ribosome” , “carbon metabolism” , “purine metabolism” , “spliceosome” , “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” , and “rna transport” .

differentially expressed genes  in response to bsa deposition
to investigate the changes in gene expression and understand the critical genes involved in the response of sheepgrass to bsa deposition, we collected the rpkm means from the grazing  and defoliation libraries  and analyzed the significant difference genes using degseq package  <cit> . the differentially expressed genes  in response to defoliation , grazing  and bsa deposition  were determined from the changes in expression of defoliation vs. control, grazing vs. control, and grazing vs. defoliation. using a screening criterion of fdr <  <dig> , we found  <dig>  genes that responded to bsa deposition, of which  <dig> were induced and  <dig>  were inhibited. we found  <dig>  genes that responded to grazing and  <dig>  genes that responded to defoliation . figure  <dig> show the details of expression changes of degs in ma plot. a cluster analysis of the libraries of control, defoliation, and grazing was performed using the heat map shown in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

by aligning our reads to the reference transcriptome dataset obtained by roche- <dig> massive pyrosequencing technology  <cit> , we obtained further details and annotations . among the degs responding to bsa deposition were serine/threonine protein kinase, apoptotic atpase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase-family proteins. most of these genes showed different modes of expression 24 h after defoliation or grazing, as shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

programmed cell death after clipping and the effect of bsa
to confirm the reliability of apoptosis in response to bsa deposition during grazing, dna fragments from cells from the cut ends of leaves treated with water or bsa were analyzed using agarose-gel electrophoresis. as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the dna fragments appeared on the third and fourth days after clipping in both the bsa- and water-treated groups. genomic dna declined by day  <dig> and disappeared by day  <dig> in the water-treated group. in the bsa-treated group, however, genomic dna decreased slowly and was still observed on day  <dig> figure  <dig>

accumulation of oxidative-stress-related factors in grazed sheepgrass
the h2o <dig> levels increased significantly in the water- and ovalbumin -treated groups compared to the unclipped controls . the ova treatment was used as a control for bsa to eliminate the interference of proteins daubed on the cut surface. daubing with bsa marginally affected the h2o <dig> levels in the cells, but this difference was not significant compared to the controls .figure  <dig>

the changes in malondialdehyde  were similar to those in hydrogen dioxide . the mda levels in the water-treated and ova-treated group were approximately 3- to 4-fold higher than those in the unclipped and bsa-treated groups, and this difference was significant at p <  <dig> . the mda levels in the bsa-treated cells increased slightly compared to the controls .

the superoxide dismutase  levels in the treated groups did not differ significantly from those of the controls . thus, the grazing treatment using bsa affected the oxidative-stress-related factors in sheepgrass only slightly.

analysis of leaf-scar lengths
the lengths of the clipping scars on the leaves reflect changes in the sheepgrass transcriptome at the macroscopic level, especially changes in the cell oxidative status and apoptosis. for the first completely expanded leaf, the scars on the leaves daubed with water were approximately  <dig> -fold longer than those on the leaves daubed with bsa , and this difference was statistically significant . the phenotype of the ova-treated leaves was similar to that of the water-treated leaves but markedly different from that of the bsa-treated leaves. however, the leaf-scar length on the last completely expanded leaf was similar in all treatments.figure  <dig>

discussion
grazing is an important and frequent stress for pasture and prairie plants. plant scientists have long studied the effects of grazing on plants as a single process. however, grazing is a complex process that involves wounding effects caused by herbivore feeding, defoliation effects due to leaf-surface loss during grazing, and the deposition of herbivore saliva onto the surface of plants. some studies have reported that wounding can stimulate plant growth but clearly differs from grazing . defoliation affects root development in grasses  <cit>  and alters the carbohydrate-metabolism pathway in rice . on the other hand, scientists have examined how plants respond to bsa deposition for decades  <cit> . saliva has been found to stimulate plant growth, enhance tiller and increase biomass  <cit> . however little is known about the molecular mechanisms of grazing responses and the genetic and functional differences among three components of grazing. to investigate the genetic profile of the grazing response in sheepgrass and to elucidate the differences in mechanism between the saliva-deposition response and the responses to other grazing components, we analyzed the transcriptomes of control, defoliated, and grazed plants using rna-seq.

sequence quality and annotation
illumina rna-seq technology had been widely used in genome-wide analyses of cotton , radish , brassica juncea, and brassica pekinensis
. here, we obtained more than five million raw reads from most samples. using the trinity transcriptome-assembly software, a total of  <dig>  assembled transcripts were obtained from seven sample libraries . of these transcripts,  <dig>  were annotated by blastx and functional-bioinformatics analyses, including the go, kog, and kegg databases. no genome of sheepgrass or close relative species was available, so most of our transcripts cannot hit known proteins. in addition, a relative stringent blast parameter  might discard a part of known hits. we obtained  <dig>  go terms,  <dig>  kog terms and  <dig>  kegg pathway terms for all transcripts combined. the gene-transcription profiles of sheepgrass after grazing were stored in an annotated-gene catalog to provide a molecular understanding of grazing responses. the remaining un-annotated transcripts may represent a sheepgrass-specific gene pool. these results provide a solid foundation for further studies of the molecular mechanisms of grazing responses and for identifying grazing-related genes in this species.

gene enrichment analysis and the effects of grazing
grasslands and grass re-growth after grazing are very important for both the ecosystem and human dairy food supply on this planet. grazing is a processing that have multiple components including at least wound, defoliation, and bsa deposition. grazing often removes completely or partially the leaf part of plants. after grazing, plants have to transport the carbohydrate such as sucrose and other energy substance due to root sink demand . in our enrichment analysis , “transporter activity” and “amino acid and derivative metabolism” in go categories, “amino acid transport and metabolism” and “lipid transport and metabolism” in kog categories, and kegg amino acid metabolism pathways were significant enrichment in grazing treatment. the results indicated that amino acid metabolism involved in plant grazing response. the amino acid metabolism pathways may contribute to protein biosynthesis and plant recovery after grazing, and the related genes are worth further study.

differential genetic profiles in response to bsa deposition
sheepgrass is a dominant grassland species in northeastern china and inner mongolia and is known for its adaptability to grazing and excellent forage quality among perennial grasses  <cit> . in this study,  <dig>  genes were expressed differently between the control and defoliation libraries, indicating that these genes responded to defoliation. similarly,  <dig>  genes were expressed differently between the control and grazing libraries, indicating that these genes responded to the combined effects of defoliation and bsa deposition. furthermore,  <dig>  genes were expressed differently between the defoliation and grazing libraries, indicating that these genes responded to bsa deposition. the only difference between these two treatments was the liquid deposited on leaves.

as shown in table  <dig>  most of the degs were down-regulated. in the kog enrichment analysis , the down-regulated degs were enriched in lipid transport and metabolism; energy production and conversion; and amino-acid transport and metabolism. thus, several functionally linked metabolic pathways were down-regulated in response to grazing. this result is consistent with a proteomic analysis of rice after ovine bsa deposition  <cit> , in which the authors found that most photosynthesis-related, energy-related, and carbohydrate-metabolism related proteins were down-regulated. bsa deposition on plants is accompanied by a multitude of stresses including oxidative stress, pathogenesis, and wounding .

we examined transcript expression in sheepgrass at three time points following grazing. the gene-expression analysis helped to clarify how the expression of the degs adjusts to grazing stress. when g <dig> , g <dig> , and g <dig>  were compared to c ,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed after 2 h,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed after 6 h, and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed after 24 h. among these,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed at all three time points, indicating that about half of the degs were stable during the first 24 h after grazing. the key pathways involved in grazing-response mechanisms may contain these genes.

apoptosis-related degs
in plants, apoptosis is induced by multiple stresses, including salt, nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and wounding . this study also shows apoptosis-related degs in response to grazing. based on functional-enrichment analysis, the apoptosis pathway is significantly involved in the saliva-deposition response. in the dna-fragmentation experiment, we found fewer dna fragments and delayed dna fragmentation following bsa deposition compared to defoliation.

the apoptosis-promoting rna-binding proteins tia- <dig> and tiar  was detected among the degs. these proteins promote dna fragmentation in digitonin-permeabilized thymocytes and are pro-apoptotic factors that influence some aspect of rna metabolism  <cit> . in our expression-mode analysis, tia-1/tiar was significantly down–regulated in the grazing treatment compared to the control and defoliation treatments. correspondingly, less dna ladder was seen after bsa deposition.

the expression of the serine/threonine kinase pak <dig> increases the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein bad and inhibits the activation of caspase, which protects cells against apoptosis  <cit> . hsp <dig> and many other heat-shock proteins can overcome both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic stimuli and confer immortality in various cell types  <cit> . metacaspases are evolutionarily distant caspase homologs that are found outside the metazoa and are known to play key roles in programmed cell death   <cit> . however, whether metacaspases in plants function as caspases is controversial  <cit> . these apoptosis-inhibiting genes were all up-regulated only in the grazing treatment.

atpases, including na+, k+, and h+ atpases, play critical roles in apoptosis  <cit> . apoptotic stimuli impair na+- and k+-atpase activity as a mechanism of neuronal death mediated by concurrent atp deficiency and oxidative stress  <cit> . several genes were annotated as “apoptotic atpases” in the kog functional analysis and their expression modes are shown in table  <dig> 

additional apoptosis- or pcd-related genes were detected among the degs. cullin controls non-lysosomal-mediated protein degradation and thus cell death  <cit> . aldehyde dehydrogenase- <dig>  converts acetaldehyde into acetate, and over-expression of an aldh <dig> transgene prevents acetaldehyde-induced cell injury and apoptosis  <cit> . the exosome-complex exonuclease rrp <dig> forms part of the exosome, which is important to the rna-processing machinery of eukaryotes and functions in rna degradation in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm  <cit> . a ca2+-dependent cysteine protease  is associated with anoxia-induced root-tip death in maize  <cit> .

programmed cell death or apoptosis is an integral part of plant ontogenesis and plays a fundamental role in plant development. according to the above described genes, we suggest that there are some important pathways of apoptosis, in response to bsa deposition during grazing in plants.

oxidative-stress-related degs
cellular oxidative stress is a common challenge for plants that usually accompanies wounding  <cit>  or senescence  <cit>  and is closely associated with apoptosis  <cit> . many apoptosis-inducing agents are either oxidants or stimulators of cellular oxidative metabolism. in our measurements of cellular oxidative status, h2o <dig>  and mda but not sod increased substantially after grazing. however, cells from sheepgrass leaves subjected to bsa deposition showed significantly low h2o <dig> and mda levels. in addition, we detected cellular oxidative-control genes among the degs.

major ros-scavenging enzymes in plants include superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , and peroxiredoxin   <cit> . we found no sod genes among the degs, indicating that sod expression was stable following the grazing process. this finding is consistent with the cellular oxidative-status experiment. furthermore, we found no prxr degs. however, the degs included apx, cat, and gpx genes . these three ros-scavenging enzymes were up-regulated in the grazing treatment compared to the control. their expression was also relatively higher in the grazing treatment than in the defoliation treatment, possibly explaining the low h2o <dig> and mda levels after bsa deposition.

the degs included other cellular oxidative-stress-related genes. ferritin prevents the formation of the highly toxic ho·radical via the metal-dependent haber–weiss reaction or the fenton reaction  <cit> . several studies have shown that biotic and abiotic stresses are accompanied by an oxidative burst mediated by nadph oxidases  <cit> . the glutaredoxin  and thioredoxin  pathways use nadph to reduce the disulfide bonds that form in some cytoplasmic enzymes during catalysis. the thioredoxin system consists of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin, and the glutaredoxin system is composed of glutathione reductase, glutathione, and three glutaredoxins  <cit> . the differential expression of these genes suggests that grazing stress or bsa deposition was closely related to cellular oxidative changes.

the present transcriptome-sequencing results and related biochemical experiments help to elucidate the response of sheepgrass to bsa deposition. after grazing, the plants receive the signal of bsa deposited on the leaves and elevate the expression of ros-scavenging enzymes and antioxidant pathways to respond to the subsequent oxidative burst in the cells. the decreased cellular oxidative levels result in fewer apoptotic cells in the grazing wound, accelerating the recovery from the grazing stress in plants. a model of sheepgrass responded to bsa deposition was indicated in figure  <dig>  the co-evolution of plants and herbivores in grazing systems may have led to this antioxidant mechanism in response to bsa deposition.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
to investigate the molecular mechanism of grazing responses, we performed transcriptome sequencing and analysis to identify degs in sheepgrass subjected to simulated bsa deposition. our results show that bsa deposition triggers differential gene expression compared to defoliation and other grazing components. based on a functional analysis of the saliva-deposition degs, the cellular-antioxidant and apoptotic pathways apparently respond to grazing stress. macroscopic changes confirm the effects of these two pathways in sheepgrass. although the connection between the two pathways requires further evidence, we believe that the saliva-deposition-induced pathways work together to contribute to plant recovery after grazing.
