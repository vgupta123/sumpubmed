BACKGROUND
genomes are sequences of nucleotides from hundreds to billions of base pairs long. as sequences of symbols they determine dictionaries, that is, formal languages constituted by words occurring in them. they encode the language of life, as dictating the functioning of all the organisms we consider living beings. a main open problem in science is to find a key to understand such an encrypted language, which more or less directly affects the structure and the interaction of all the cellular and multicellular components  <cit> . it is like having at hand a book, the language of which has still to be deciphered  <cit> . namely, the international long-term project encode  <cit>  is searching for encyclopedias, lexicons, catalogs, of dna biochemically annotated elements in human genome.

working on genomic dictionaries requires the elaboration of enormous moles of data. as an example, the dictionary of all the substrings of length  <dig> occurring in drosophila melanogaster’s genome has more than  <dig> millions of words, which require, only to be stored, non-trivial implementations of ad hoc procedures. to the best of our knowledge, exhaustive studies on collections of k-mers were carried out for values of k which do not exceed  <dig> .

the starting point of our analysis was the computation of all k-mers, with k =  <dig> , <dig>  of given genomes, listed in table  <dig>  some properties of such specific dictionaries and their compared statistics guided our research along lines of development which were in part already present in the literature  <cit> , and in part took us towards new topics, which emerged just from the empirical evidence of computed data. an interesting concept in this context is that of hapax . in manuscripts these words are relevant for authorship attribution, in genomes they seem to play essential roles in the genome organization as opposed to repeat strings, which instead occur more than once.

in table  <dig> a list is reported of twelve  genomic sequences, to which we applied the methodology described below. they correspond to genomes of well known organisms, constituting biological models, of relevance in various kinds of genomic analysis. the sequences were downloaded from public websites as fasta files, and processed by a dedicated java software that we developed.

in the following basic terminology for genomic dictionaries and multisets, and genomic profiles/distributions, is introduced, along with a simple example focused on a specific dna sequence. results are reported in terms of both an analysis of dictionaries of k-long hapaxes and repeats, together with the introduction of three related dictionary-based informational indexes, and the definition of k-repeat sharing gene networks. section discussion is then developed around a phase-transition observed in k-dictionaries from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  and around the structure of genomic information which emerges when dictionary cardinality trends and multplicity-comultiplicity distributions are compared with those of randomly permuted sequences. a description of the software suite developed to perform all our computations is finally presented in section methods.

basic notations
let us denote by Γ the genomic alphabet of four symbols : Γ={a,t,c,g} .

a genome g is representable by a sequence over Γ, that is, a table assigning a symbol of Γto each position . symbols are written in a linear order, from left to right, according to the standard writing system of west languages, and to the chemical orientation 5′−3′ of dna molecules. by associating to each symbol of Γthe set of positions where it occurs, g may be equivalently identified by four sets of numbers.

all factors  of a genome g are collected in the set d, while we call k-genomic dictionary ofg , denoted by dk, the set of all the k-long substrings of genome g. the k-genomic tabletk, which mathematically corresponds to a multiset, is defined by equipping the words of dk with their multiplicities, that is, the number of their respective occurrences in g. let α denote the multiplicity of α and posg gives the set of positions of α in a genome g . of course, it holds α = |posg|. hence, the table tk may be represented by an association of strings to their corresponding multiplicities: α ↦ α, with α ∈ dk. the sum of all the multiplicities of elements in dk is called the size of tk, denoted by |tk|, with the same sign for string length and for set cardinality . it is easy to realize that: 

 |tk|=|g|−k+ <dig>  

word distribution in a genome may be represented along a graphical profile, which measures the number of k-words having a given number of occurrences. words having the same multiplicity in a k-genomic table tk can be grouped and their number is called comultiplicity. as an instance, for the sequence attaggatcttaat, we have: six 2-words occurring once , two words occurring twice , one word  occurring  <dig> times, and seven 2-words which do not occur at all.

if we report 2-words multiplicities on the x-axis and their number  on the y-axis, we obtain the chart in figure 1a. we call such curves multiplicity-comultiplicityk-distribution  of a genome. this kind of charts  <cit>  represents a recent approach in genome analysis, opening new investigation lines about the internal logic underlying genome organizations. the same information may be graphically reported as a rank-multiplicity zipf map . as one may notice by looking at figure  <dig>  both the middle and final inclination of zipf’s curves is different for four of our organisms, accounting for the multiplicity range in which we have a major density of strings. in all cases, we have few units with maximal multiplicity, indeed zipf curves initially slope down steeply.

several other nice representations of genomic frequencies may be found in the literature, for example by means of images .

RESULTS
two important types of factors of genomes are hapaxes and repeats. a hapax of a genome g is a factor α of g such that α =  <dig>  a repeat of g is a factor α of g such that α >  <dig>  two or more contiguous occurrences of one repeat form a sequence technically called tandem repeat, if the repeated sequence is shorter than  <dig> nucleotides, one has a minisatellite or short tandem repeat. they describe patterns helpful to determine individual’s inherited traits, namely to determine parentage or genealogical information.

back to the dictionaries, the set h of hapaxes of g and the set r of repeats of g of course constitute a bipartition of d  and r are nonempty, also disjoint sets, such that their union is d). we set 

 hk=Γk∩handrk=Γk∩r 

 where ∩ is the set-theoretic intersection.

therefore, given a genome g of length n, for any k ≤ n we can read it according to the bi-partition of its k-genomic dictionaries hk and rk. size variations of k-genomic, k-hapax and k-repeat dictionaries, for k =  <dig> …, <dig>  are analyzed in the following , while the size of “forbidden dictionaries” , for given genomes, is of course exponentially increasing with k.

according to data reported in table  <dig>  in the first three genomes of the list, |d6| slightly decreases and repetitiveness slightly increases for longer genomes. when the analyzed genomes length exceeds about  <dig> , <dig> base pairs, the decomposition of d <dig> in hapaxes and repeats keeps the identical respective cardinalities. all the 6-genomic dictionaries are composed by only repeat words .

in table  <dig>  the number of hapax words |h <dig> | appears not related to the length of genome g, and neither to the cardinality of d12; while the ratio of 12-hapaxes over 12-repeats hr <dig> appears roughly decreasing with the genome length. this is due to the fact that 12-repeat words constitute a considerable portion of 12-genomic dictionary, actually a percentage  which increases with the genome length . the average 12-factors repeatability index, in the last column, accounts for the average repeatability of 12-repeats in all the genomes.

in table  <dig>  cardinality of d18and h18increase with the genome length, as expected. as a notable result though, we can see that the 18-repeat-factor ratio rd <dig> is firmly fixed  on a very small portion of the 18-genomic dictionary, mostly ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , independently on the genome length. the 18-hapax-repeat ratio hr <dig> does not show a regular behavior with respect to the length, but its values are considerably greater for longer words . the average 18-factor repeatability index does not exhibit the regularity of the average 12-factor repeatability with respect to the genome length, it even shows an exceptionally high value for the chromosome  <dig> of h. sapiens.

it is easy to see that any genomic factor containing a hapax as a substring is an hapax as well. hence an hapax within the genome may be elongated  up to reach the genome itself, which is of course an hapax. it is then interesting to evaluate, for each genome g: i) how |hk| varies with k , ii) the k-hapax positions , and iii) the shortest length of an hapax. also, a k-similarity between genomes g and g′ could be measured by |hk∩hk| .

the concepts of hapax and repeat provide a great number of related notions which permit to define important aspects in the analysis of real genomes. in following sections we will discuss numerical data, reported in tables, diagrams, and figures, which include the measure of the ratio between |hk| and |rk| as a function of k . we observed a sort of transition phase effect in the passage from d <dig> to d <dig>  in almost all genomes of table  <dig>  where a clear inversion appears in the ratio hapax-cardinality/repeat-cardinality.

dictionary based indexes
for a genome g we may define k-lexicality, that is, the ratio lk = |dk|/|tk|, which expresses the percentage of distinct k-factors of g with respect to the all the k-factors present in g . of course, the inverse of this ratio provides an average repeatability of k-factors in g.

a more refined measure for the averagek-factors repeatability in g may be now given as: 

 ark=|tk∖hk||rk| 

 where k-hapaxes have been excluded by both the k-genomic multiset and the k-genomic dictionary . index ark counts the proper  repeatability of k-repeats in genome g .

finally, maximal repeats of a genome g are substrings occurring at least twice and having maximal length. some numerical indexes related to this concept are i) the maximal repeat length mr, ii) the number of different maximal repeat sequences, and iii) the number of times each maximal subsequence is repeated .

all genomes turned out to have only one repeat having maximal length , and the distance of the two positions  is reported in table  <dig>  they are in most cases relatively very close. although for k =  <dig> , <dig>  |rk| increases with the genome length n, there is no apparent correlation between n and the mr index .

any substring of a repeat word is still a repeat, with an own multiplicity along the genome, and inside the repeat word itself. a further index is thus defined over genomes g, called mr , as the maximal length of words Γsuch that γ >  <dig>  an algorithmic way to find it  starts from repeats out of d <dig>  and checks how much they may be elongated on the genome by keeping their status of repeat words. data related to the mr index computed over our genomes are reported in table  <dig>  where the only mr-long repeat of each genome exhibits a non-trivial structure , and complex repeats are obtained for many lengths.

the importance of word repeatability is crucial in understanding the information content of texts. a genome analysis in terms of  hapaxes and  repeats, providing their relative distribution within the genome, highlights the associative nature of dna as a container of information  <cit> . localization  and frequency  of dna fragments of specific length is indeed crucial in understanding the information organization of genomes  <cit> .

repeat-sharing gene networks
once we discovered that the percentage of repeats in dictionaries is “low” , we focused on studying the positions of 18-repeats along the genome, in order to check if they are more densely present in encoding regions or non-coding ones. this investigation allowed us to design a synthetic gene network in the following way: nodes are genes, and they are connected by an edge if they have at least one common repeat . an interest for this kind of diagram  finds a motivation in the hypothetic communication between genes due to competitions for short endogenous rna sequences  proposed in  <cit> .

we have work in progress to investigate these k-parametrized labeled gene networks by standard methods of graph theory and network analysis. gene nodes with higher degrees turned out to be actually involved in important long genetic pathways, and for specific values of k, between  <dig> and  <dig>  drastic changes may be observed in the network conformation, while emerging several clusters of genes. however, this is out of the scope of this work, even if it will be a natural extension of it.

discussion
in this session we would like to specifically discuss the computational results reported in all the tables, and the importance of reading a genome by its mutliplicity-comultiplicity k-distribution. in both cases internal structural properties of genomes emerge which highlight regularity indicators, based on the number and distribution of repeats.

for all our genomes of table  <dig>  listed according to an increasing genome length order, we report in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> numerical data related to the computation of dk,hk,rk for k =  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectivelya.

a peculiar phenomenon regarding hapax statistical distribution may be observed passing from the 12- to the 18-genomic dictionary . for all the genomes, by enlarging the k value, the number of hapax increases, even relatively to the number of repeats . indeed, by computing hrk=|hk||rk| for k =  <dig> , we see that repeatability generally increases with genome length for k =  <dig> , while this regularity disappears for k =  <dig> 

more interestingly, the  amount of hapaxes increases by some orders of magnitude with k passing from  <dig> to  <dig>  based on this observation coming from computational experiments, one could suppose that by increasing the word size, genomic dictionaries composed of only hapaxes may be computed . this intuition though has been invalidated by further computations . in fact, repeats having length of several thousands have been found within each of our genomes , and 12→ <dig> represents a sort of phase transition from scarce to abundant hapax/repeat distribution. this phenomenon would surely deserve a more detailed and generalized analysis.

random vs real genomes
we have carried out a systematic study of repeat distribution, of real and randomly permuted genomes , in order to get new information on the structure of such relevant motifs  <cit> .

we produced some diagrams showing how the number of genomic, hapax, and repeat words of a given length varies with respect to the length , and a common remarkable finding is the similar shapes of the curves, where the transition aforementioned occurs. cardinality trends of sets dk , rk , and hk , for k =  <dig> …, <dig> are compared for genomes and their random permutations, and specifically for human chromosome, a greater difference between random and non-random situation may be clearly observed .

if we compare the dictionaries of the genome with those of its random permutation , we find quite similar curves. however, even when diagrams follow the same general trends, specific characters of these curves correspond to features which are typical of the single genomes  <cit> . in general, random values are always considerably greater than non-random values, for both hapax and whole dictionaries, while the opposite appears for repeats, before and after the distribution peaks.

all the data were confirmed along with several random permutations. however, apart of the comparison with permuted sequences, we would like to observe the shape of |rk| in itself. only in a limited range of values for k, rkhas a significant size, and such a range is  <cit>  for all the analyzed genomes, with a pick around the value k= <dig>  while both shifting towards the values  <dig>   <dig> for the pick, with the increasing of genome length.

multiplicity-comultiplicity charts have been computed for all the genomes as well, by means of an application of the software described in the methods section. displays some of them for 6-words of four organisms: escherichia coli, saccharomyces cervisiae, drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens . blue bars are related to real genome sequences and red bars concern random permutations of the same sequences. at a first glance, in real genome distributions  we notice a common trend, very similar to a poisson distribution, with specific peculiarities which characterize each genome. on the other hand, random permutations of genomic sequences have multimodal distributions which depend on base frequencies.

we observe that the multplicity-comultiplicity distribution of escherichia coli has multiplicities  between about  <dig> and about  <dig> , whereas drosophila melanogaster has multiplicities between about  <dig>  and about  <dig> . on the other hand, the maximum comultiplicity is  <dig> for escherichia coli, and is  <dig> for drosophila melanogaster . these parameters are very different even if the “shape” of the genomic sequences in the two charts is quite similar. in order to perform a comprehensive analysis of multplicity-comultiplicity distribution we have dealt with them as probability distributions, and we have computed about  <dig> statistical indexes which characterize them, such as, maximum, minimum and mean multiplicity, maximum, minimum and mean comultiplicity, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, mode, entropy, etc. in  <cit>  these indexes have been successfully employed to classify genomes according to their organism kingdom.

as a conclusion, in figure  <dig> we would like to point out that in cases of random permutations of genomes, multimodal shapes may be observed, which depend on the base frequencies of genomes. however, the apparently more ordered concentrations of word multiplicities, around the modes, can be explained by considering that frequencies allow us to classify  words corresponding to the same multiset . consequently, due to the random effect, being the words with the same multiset equally probable, they concentrate around the multiplicity associated to this probability. these distribution differences between randomly permuted genomes and real genomes is another measure of the information content that genomes have with respect to casual sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
bipartition of a genomic dictionary in hapax and repeat words emphasizes the roots of precise string categories which are related to the functional organization of genomes. the set of 18-repeats in our genomes has a digital size which is a couple of orders smaller than the whole genome, and it seems to have a role of “lexical” coding, that is, a semantics external to the genome. other elements, with a notably bigger digital size, seem to have a role of addressing, delimiting, coordinating, just like position-identification tags.

the definition, computation, and analysis of well characterized dictionary based genomic indexes have pointed out some phenomena of genomic regularity and specificity. they can highlight our knowledge about the internal logic of genome structure and organization, as well as about evolutional and functional attributes of genomes .

future work
there are several lines of development that our research is intended to pursue. we are already working on some of these, mainly focused on the study of intersections among genomic dictionaries. it would be interesting to check the relationship between words recurrent in dictionary intersections and those which are known to be conserved along the evolutive lineages. another research line concerns the inter-genomic character of hapaxes and repeats. the question is about which hapaxes  of a given genome occur in other genomes of a certain class by keeping their status of hapax  when compared to the new context of words.

finally, we conclude with a fundamental question which points out a novel perspective related to the approach developed in the paper: what is the essence of a genome? for genome functions, two aspects are essential: the presence of some factors and their relative positions. discovering which factors are essential, the classes related to their roles, and the mechanisms for expressing their relative positions, could provide essential properties of genomes, even without a detailed knowledge of their whole sequence. the approach outlined in this paper could be considered as a first step in the exploration of this perspective.
