BACKGROUND
systems biology aims to integrate different levels and types of information to understand how biological organisms function and responds to perturbations. it uses a range of computational methods and relies extensively on massive amounts of data provided by high throughput methods and parallel large-scale measurements. a significant and urgent problem of molecular systems biology is the integration of new data into the preexisting, accumulated data, and then re-interpretation of the newly integrated total information. this is particularly acute in transcriptomics, where microarrays and rna sequencing generate and daily append large amount of new data into the established databanks. individual researchers and groups can relatively easily, although not inexpensively, produce and submit new transcriptomics data, but are often stymied trying to incorporate their contributions into the established, preexisting knowledge. information technology core facilities, on the other hand, while providing data storage and access to analysis programs, seldom understand the specifics of individual investigator’s research areas and such cores usually find it difficult to customize their analysis for a particular, distinct project.

here, we use readily available, web-based, free computational metaanalysis methods to integrate the transcriptional consequences of treating human epidermal keratinocytes with egf with the related, existing transcriptomics data in public databanks.

egf was among the first signalling molecules isolated, and was named for its capacity to accelerate epidermal differentiation and eye opening in newborn mice
 <cit> . egf has become a paradigm for studies of extracellular and intracellular signalling
 <cit> . egf binds to its receptor, egfr, causing receptor dimerization and consequent activation of its cytoplasmic kinase
 <cit> . the activated kinase initiates several signal transduction cascades of protein phosphorylation, resulting in activation of transcription factors that regulate expression of many genes
 <cit> . egf promotes cell survival, proliferation, chemotactic migration, and suppresses terminal differentiation, inhibits apoptosis etc.
 <cit> . egfr is a member of the erbb protein family and binds several ligands in addition to egf, e.g., tgfα, and hb-egf
 <cit> .

the transcriptome changes caused by egf have not been extensively explored in its eponymous tissue, although egf is very important in the healthy epidermal homeostasis and in several diseases
 <cit> . specifically in the epidermis, egf is known to contribute to wound healing, regulate barrier function, suppress terminal differentiation, cause loss of adhesion, induce secreted proteases etc.
 <cit> . egfr is over-expressed in squamous cell carcinomas
 <cit> . perhaps understandably, the published microarray analyses of the effects of egf mainly focused on breast cancer and glioblastoma cell lines, the two types of cancer with egfr-associated aetiology and have provided valuable data on the molecular effect of its action in several cell lines
 <cit> . detailed molecular understanding of the egfr kinase domain led to development of specific inhibitors, gefitinib, erlotinib, herceptin, cetuximab, currently used to treat breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, head-and-neck and other cancers
 <cit> .

to define systematically and comprehensively the transcriptional changes caused by egf in primary human epidermal keratinocytes, we treated these cells with egf and compared parallel treated and control cultures using affymetrix microarrays. we then used metaanalysis programs to integrate the observed changes with a large set of already existing data on transcriptional profiling in epidermal keratinocytes and with data of egf-treated non-epidermal cell types in geo database. we found that egf affects keratinocyte proliferation, attachment and motility and, surprisingly induces dusps, phosphatases that attenuate the egf signal transduction in a feed-back loop. metaanalysis identified specific overlapping effects of egf with those of il- <dig> and ifnγ, which play a role in keratinocyte activation, inflammation and wound healing. conversely, we identified the specific genes and processes suppressed by egf, but induced by pro-differentiation agents. metaanalysis comparison of egf effects in other cell types identified extensive similarities between the responses in keratinocytes and in other epithelial cell types, but differences with e.g., endothelial cells. we also found characteristic differences with transformed, oncogenic epithelial cell lines. our approach can serve as a paradigm for integration of new omics data into preexisting databases and analysis of the integrated data.

RESULTS
early time points,  <dig> and 4 hrs
approximately  <dig> genes were induced by 50% or more at any of the time points, and  <dig> were suppressed by the egf treatment in human epidermal keratinocytes. the regulated genes are listed in the additional file
1: table s <dig>  a small number of genes,  <dig>  are both induced and suppressed by egf, at different time points; of these,  <dig> are induced early, but suppressed late and  <dig> have just the opposite regulation pattern.

intriguingly, among the most prominent induced genes are  <dig> dual specificity phosphatases, dusp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> . these enzymes de-phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, the kinases of the erk pathways
 <cit> . as a result of this de-phosphorylation, the signal transduction cascades activated by the egf are attenuated. apparently, the induction of the dusps is one of the important feed-back mechanisms that limits the intensity and duration of the egf effects in keratinocytes.

selected categories from david analysis are presented, sorted from the best p-values from each set. up denotes induced by egf, down suppressed. count gives the number of regulated genes in each category.

as expected, egf, being a fundamental and wide-reaching signal, affects a fairly large number of signalling pathways. immediately after addition, i.e., in the first hour, egf suppressed production of  <dig> genes in the ‘signalling’ ontological category, including  <dig> insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, mucins, cytokines and their receptors as well as secreted lectins, enzymes with signalling function, such as kallikrein peptidases, and structural proteins with signalling function, such as cadherins, desmocollins and desmogleins. presumably, their suppression inactivates the corresponding active signalling pathways, and prepares the cells for new biological processes and reactions. at the 4 h time point,  <dig> signalling genes are induced, again comprising a wide range of functions and pathways. for example, proteases with signalling function, adam <dig>  adam <dig>  cathepsins, thrombospondin, coagulation factors and mmps are induced, but so are protease inhibitors, such as serpins, timp <dig> etc. also induced at this time point are integrins and components of the extracellular matrix, e.g., laminin v and tenascin. particularly noteworthy is the induction of amphiregulin and tgfα ; both are egfr activating ligands that can sustain or extend the initial signal by egf
 <cit> .

among the regulators of proliferation and cell cycle, which are induced after 1 h of egf treatment, we find cdk <dig>  the protein thought to serve as a direct link between the regulation of transcription and the cell cycle
 <cit> . transcription factors including btg <dig>  cyclin g <dig>  gaddα, jun, jun b, v-fos etc. are also induced . interestingly, regulation of apoptosis is also one of the ontological categories induced early after egf treatment . parenthetically, we note that the negative regulators of apoptosis are suppressed at the 48 h time point .

egf strongly affects cell adhesion and motility through induction of focal adhesion, basement membrane and integrin binding protein categories. cell adhesion and motility are complex processes that require a large set of coordinated protein functions; egf affects these processes by inducing certain genes, e.g., α-actinin, cadherin  <dig>  thrombin receptor, smad <dig> and smad <dig>  vegf-a and vegf-c , while suppressing others, e.g., desmocollins  <dig> and  <dig>  desmoglein  <dig>  cadherins, etc. . in addition, egf induced the expression of several proteins that, when mutated, cause in epidermolysis bullosa, such as integrin α <dig>  laminin α <dig>  . it is unclear at present whether egf-targeted treatment may be beneficial in certain epidermolysis bullosa patients.

to confirm the proliferative and pro-migratory effects of egf in human epidermal keratinocytes, we counted the cells in egf-treated and control cultures, and we examined the re-epithelialization of scratches in culture . as expected from previous studies and from the results described above, the addition of egf profoundly improved both the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes.

importantly, egf induces defence and wounding response genes in keratinocytes. these include angiogenic signalling proteins, such as vegf-a, vegf-c, ptk2b, activin a receptor, cadherin  <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  placental growth factor, plasminogen activator, urokinase, tgfα, . additionally, proinflammatory cytokines, including il-1b and il- <dig>  are induced. the induction of defence and wounding response genes by egf is congruent with the known protective role of egf during skin wound healing
 <cit> . curiously, certain genes in the ontological categories of defence and wounding responses, such as fibrinogen α, pdgf receptor, lysozyme etc., are simultaneously suppressed by egf . however, in general, the function of the suppressed genes in the defence and wounding responses ontological categories is different from the function of the induced ones: the suppressed genes often include immune system modulators, e.g., il- <dig>  and interferon-α <dig>  as well as the infection fighting proteins e.g., defensin b- <dig>  lysozyme, tlr <dig>  s100a <dig>  etc. the ontological category of wounding response is broad and apparently egf promotes certain aspects thereof, such as re-epithelialization and wound closure, while repressing others, such as antimicrobial processes and certain aspects of the immune response.

interestingly, many proteins known as markers of keratinocyte differentiation are suppressed by egf . these include keratins krt <dig> and krt <dig>  filaggrin, desmosomal proteins, sprr and also members of the ca-binding, s <dig> family genes.

late time points,  <dig> and 48 hrs
importantly, the dusps remain induced in the egf-treated keratinocytes at the late time points as well, specifically dusp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> . at 24 h egf induces expression of several secreted proteins, such as proteases, including mmp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as well as protease inhibitors, such as serpins; presumably, these play a role in matrix remodelling, given that matrix components fibronectin and laminin are also induced . among the secreted growth factors we particularly note tgfα and hb-egf, the egfr ligands, feed-back extenders of the original signal. we also note the induction of vegf-a and vegf-c, two angiogenic factors .

genes promoting proliferation are induced at 24 h, including hb-egf and tgfα, as well as additional secreted signals and their receptors . wound healing and angiogenesis proteins are induced, including cd <dig>  adam <dig>  dkk <dig>  endothelin receptor a, fibronectin  <dig>  integrin α <dig>  interferon-γ receptor  <dig>  mmp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> urokinase, urokinase receptor, plasminogen activator and serpins-b <dig> and -e <dig>  . extracellular matrix structural and remodelling proteins timp <dig>  annexin a <dig>  fibronectin  <dig>  laminin γ <dig>  mmps etc. are induced after 48 h .

interestingly, and in contrast with the early time points, certain keratinocyte-specific genes are induced by egf, including some markers of keratinocyte differentiation. these include s <dig> calcium binding proteins, sprrs, involucrin, serpin-b <dig> etc. . lipid and steroid biosynthesis enzymes, tangential markers of epidermal differentiation, are also induced; these include atp citrate lyase, sterol isomerase, hydroxysteroid-17-β-dehydrogenase  <dig> and pyruvate carboxylase. unexpectedly, 48 h after egf addition,  <dig> different metallothioneins are induced ; their role in keratinocytes in response to egf is unknown.

the ontological categories suppressed at  <dig> and 48 hrs include cell cycle and apoptosis. the cell cycle regulation 48 h after egf addition continues primarily by suppression of cyclins a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and cdk <dig>  although notably, cdk inhibitors p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are also suppressed . desmosome components and cadherins are suppressed at  <dig> and 48 hrs, as are several keratin genes . unexpectedly, we find krt <dig> in the suppressed gene set; krt <dig> is a known marker of proliferation and is induced in the early times after egf addition
 <cit> . the suppression of these cytoskeletal proteins may play a role in keratinocyte adhesion and locomotion.

a set of genes that respond to steroids is suppressed by egf at the late time points . this we find curious, because, as noted above, the steroid biosynthesis enzymes are induced . perhaps the locally produced steroids accumulate at an even later time point. alternatively, these steroid-responsive genes are suppressed specifically to modulate the steroid response; this interesting metabolic issue deserves further examination.

transcription factors
the transcriptional changes in response to egf are, presumably, effected by changes in the activity of transcription factors . to identify the putative transcription factors responsible, we searched for tf binding sites statistically overrepresented in the regulated genes using david
 <cit> . interestingly, we find that the induced genes contain an overabundance of bach <dig> and bach <dig> binding sites . statistically, the bach binding sites are the most prominent ones in the regulated genes at all time points. the bach proteins are basic leucine zipper transcription factors, can function both as transcription activators and as transcriptional repressors and regulate transcription of genes involved in g1/s and g2/m phases of the cell cycle; they form heterodimers with mafk proteins and are known to be sensitive to oxidative stress
 <cit> . inhibition of bach <dig> reduces uv light-caused damage in keratinocytes, apparently through regulating the expression of heme oxygenases
 <cit> . in vitro, bachs bind to ap1/nf-e <dig> binding sites, tgatca
 <cit> . we note that transcriptionally functional ap <dig> sites have been found in a large proportion of keratinocyte differentiation marker genes
 <cit> . the expression of the individual members of the ap <dig> protein family in different layers of the epidermis is controversial. it is, therefore, possible that the bach proteins perform functions until now attributed to the ap <dig> proteins. our results suggest that the bach proteins play important roles in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, in particular in response to egf.

a) induced genes, b) suppressed genes. the top p-value sites are presented for each time point. count columns give the number of genes with the respective binding sites, % the percentage of submitted genes that have the site, while benjamini and fdr , represent statistical values corrected for multiple comparisons. note the recurrence of bach <dig>  bach <dig>  ap <dig> and nf-e <dig> sites, marked with double asterisk, which bind to similar dna sequences. at  <dig> and 24 h, in suppressed genes, the ap <dig> sites barely miss the statistical cut off p-value of  <dig> ; they are included here nevertheless.

the genes induced at early time points additionally contain a statistical overabundance of ik <dig>  lmo2com, pax <dig> and sox <dig> binding sites. while these results suggest that these four tfs mediate the egf response, it is also possible that the overrepresented consensus binding sites could be recognized by other, related transcription factors in epidermal keratinocytes.

much fewer tf binding sites reached statistical significance in the promoters of suppressed genes . we note that cebpβ sites have been identified at both early and late time point genes. cebpβ regulates genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses and has been shown to bind to regulatory regions of several acute-phase and cytokine genes
 <cit> . additionally, binding sites for pou3f <dig>  appear over-represented in the suppressed genes. this transcription factor has not been noted in keratinocytes before .

as a final point, we note that ap <dig> sites are common in the suppressed genes as well , although only at 48 hrs do the ap <dig> sites reach our significance cut-off p-value better than  <dig> . clearly, the relative contributions of bach, ap <dig> and nf-e <dig> transcription factors in epidermal keratinocytes, their differentiation and their responses to egf require more careful, in-depth study.

metaanalysis, part 1: intersections of genes regulated by egf and by other extracellular agents in keratinocytes
we compared the lists of genes regulated by egf with lists of genes identified previously as regulated by extracellular signals, namely interferon-γ , interleukin  <dig> , retinoic acid , ephrin as and sp <dig>  a specific inhibitor of jnk
 <cit> . the numbers of genes present in each list analyzed are given in additional file
4: table s <dig>  we used the lists2networks program for comparisons and collected both the matrix of p-values for overlapping of related lists, as well as bonferoni-corrected lists of gene ontology categories ‘biological process’ and ‘molecular function’
 <cit> . we also examined genmapp and kegg pathways, kea kinase targets, predicted promoter sites and omim disease-associated genes. the gene ontology biological process comparisons gave the most complete and detailed results and these will be presented here ; the other categories gave qualitatively similar, if sparser results .

a) the egf and interferon-γ overlaps b) the egf and il- <dig> overlaps. up denotes induced, dn suppressed genes. the numbers represent the p-values. while many ontological categories are redundant, closely related or overly general, note that keratinocyte differentiation is suppressed in all three sets, the egf-, interferon-γ-, and il-1-regulated genes. also note that processes related to cell motility are induced by egf and il- <dig>  but not by ifnγ.

up denotes induced, dn suppressed genes. note that the genes induced by egf are suppressed by ephrinas and sp <dig>  and vice versa.

comparing lists of egf-regulated genes revealed very interesting patterns: egf, ifnγ and il- <dig> induce and suppress related sets of genes, while ephrinas and sp <dig> have antiparallel effects: genes induced by egf are suppressed by ephrinas and sp <dig>  and vice versa . even more intriguing is the comparison of the egf- and ra-regulated genes: parallel at 1 h after ra addition, the relationship is antiparallel after  <dig> and 24 h and lost after 48 hrs .

in comparisons of regulated genes, one finds many redundant or overly general ontological categories, which have to be parsed in order to detect the specific and important ontological categories regulated in parallel. for example, comparing lists of egf- and ifnγ-regulated genes , we find in common very general categories, such as ‘biological process,’ ‘metabolic process’ or ‘cell communication.’ however, we also find specific categories: at early time points both egf and ifnγ induce common regulators of transcription and, importantly, response to stress and response to wounding. conversely, both egf and ifnγ suppress keratinocyte differentiation and epidermis development genes. another set of stress response genes is suppressed in common by egf and by ifnγ. at the later time points,  <dig> and 48 h, proliferation and cell cycle genes are suppressed by both .

a somewhat different picture emerges in the comparisons of the egf- and il-1-regulated genes . like ifnγ, il- <dig> induces regulators of transcription and responses to stress and wounding. importantly, unlike ifnγ, il- <dig> also induces sets of genes responsible for cell motility and chemotaxis. again distinctly from ifnγ, il- <dig> induces inhibitors of apoptosis. similar to ifnγ, il- <dig> suppresses keratinocyte differentiation and epidermis development genes. this suppression continues in il- <dig> treated keratinocytes longer than in the ifnγ-treated ones, and is still noticeable at 48 h .

using the lists2networks program
 <cit>  for comparisons of predicted transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of regulated genes, we see again characteristic overlaps between the genes co-regulated by egf and ifnγ and those co-regulated by egf and il- <dig> . for example, both egf and ifnγ activate many transcription factors of the ap <dig> family, fos and jun, and the rel nfκb proteins after 24 h . the overlap of transcription factors targets for egf and il- <dig> is sparser than for egf and ifnγ; in particular, fewer common ap <dig> protein binding sites were identified in the genes regulated by both egf and il- <dig> 

we also used lists2networks to identify the kinases whose targets are overrepresented in the regulated genes
 <cit> . using the kea kinase targets analysis, we found that both egf and ifnγ induce targets of mapk- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  as well as of the receptor kinases egfr, insr, jak- <dig> and − <dig>  however, only rock <dig> targets are induced already at 1 h, the targets for other kinases are overrepresented in parallel at later times . egf, ifnγ and il- <dig> induce a similar family of kinase targets, but this induction occurs earlier in the il-1-treated cells than in the ifnγ-treated ones . despite larger sets of common kinase targets induced by egf and il- <dig>  the set of transcription factors activated in common by egf and il- <dig> is sparser – fewer ap <dig> proteins were identified. we note, parenthetically, that the kinases, and even more the transcription factors activated solely by ifnγ or by il- <dig>  are very distinct. this suggests that the effects of egf overlap the distinct subset of the effects of ifnγ and of il- <dig> 

certain genes induced by egf are suppressed by ephrinas, and vice versa . we reported that ephrinas induce keratinocyte differentiation markers
 <cit> ; here we show that these markers are suppressed by egf. the antiparallel effects are evident at both early and late time points . sp <dig> also induces keratinocyte differentiation
 <cit> ; correspondingly, similar antiparallel effects are seen in the egf- and sp600125-treated keratinocytes . moreover, sp <dig> induced inhibitors of proliferation, another effect antiparallel to egf. interestingly, the antiparallel effects of ephrinas and sp <dig> are distinct and seem to proceed via different mechanisms: of the kinases targets induced by egf, ephrinas seem to suppress the targets of mapk- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  while sp <dig> none at all. conversely the targets of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> suppressed by egf at late time point, seem induced by sp <dig>  but not by ephrinas . again, the effects of egf overlap the distinct effects of ephrinas and of the jnk inhibitor sp <dig> 

up denotes induced, dn suppressed genes. all kinases with p-values better than  <dig>  for the egf-regulated targets are listed. no kinases common to all three agents were identified.

an interesting paradox emerges from the comparison of genes regulated by egf and by ra . at the earliest time point, 1 h after addition of ra, the effects are largely antiparallel; for example, cell motility genes are inhibited by ra, while egf induces those . at 4 h, both ra and egf in parallel induce transcription factors and signal transduction and in parallel suppress apoptosis genes . similar parallel effects are maintained after 24 h, when cell adhesion and cell motion seems induced by both egf and ra. interestingly, while mapks seem suppressed by ra after 1 h, they appear activated after 4 h. their activation is not maintained at later time points, e.g., at 24 h, when targets of kinases egfr, erbb <dig> and insulin receptor appear specifically induced in the egf treated keratinocytes . the only transcription factors regulated by both egf and ra to a statistically significant level are the nfκb proteins rel/rela .

the early egf-induced genes have extensive overlaps with both induced and suppressed genes by ra. a) common processes in the egf-induced and ra-suppressed genes 1 h after ra treatment. b) common processes in the egf-induced and ra-induced genes 4 h after ra treatment. c) common kinase targets in the products of egf-induced and ra-regulated genes. d) only the nfkb family transcription factors have binding site overrepresented in both the egf-induced and ra-regulated genes.

metaanalysis, part 2: egf effects in keratinocytes vs. egf effects in other cell types
egf is a catholic regulator affecting many different cell types. curiously, transcriptional responses to egf have been described in several established cell lines, but not in primary cultures. we compared our data with egf-regulated genes from  <dig> published studies, gse <dig>  gse <dig>  gse <dig> and gse13009
 <cit> . these studies were selected because they compare directly egf-treated vs. untreated cells and, for ease of comparison, because they used affymetrix microarrays.

interestingly, we find that in epidermal keratinocytes, as well as in hela and mcf10a cell lines, egf regulates many genes in parallel at the early time points,  <dig> and 4 hrs . while in keratinocytes there is a very significant overlap between genes regulated at early and at late time points , the parallel with hela and mcf10a is clear for the induced genes only, not for the suppressed ones. similarly, the parallel between keratinocytes and huvec holds for the induced genes only. in contrast, mcf <dig> cell line shows transcriptional effects antiparallel to those of keratinocytes, particularly at the later time points, at 48 h.

we find important parallels in the biological processes regulated by egf in different cell types . specifically, regulation of transcription is affected in all cell types compared, at all time points . similarly, negative regulators of apoptosis are induced in all cell types, although perhaps a little delayed in huvec . on the other hand, regulation of cell motility, signal transduction and cell proliferation are regulated in all four epithelial cell types, but not in the endothelial cells, huvec . please also note that in mcf <dig>  transformed cells, the regulators of transcription are downregulated at 48 hrs .

the rightmost column shows the antiparallel overlap, i.e., with the genes suppressed by egf in mcf <dig> cells. * letters a – e indicate the fully or largely redundant biological processes.

discussion
to define comprehensively the molecular effects of egf in human epidermal keratinocytes we used transcriptional profiling and identified the regulated genes. we compared these with genes regulated in keratinocytes by other extracellular signals, and with genes regulated by egf in other cell types. we found both expected and unexpected classes of regulated genes. because egf regulates keratinocyte proliferation, the cell cycle genes are prominently regulated, as expected; conversely, the apoptotic signal genes are suppressed. similarly, numerous genes related to motility and substrate attachment are induced by egf, whereas those promoting rigid cell-to-cell contacts are suppressed. as expected from such a wide-ranging regulator, egf induced many signalling proteins, both intra- and extracellular. unexpectedly, egf induced multiple members of the dusp family; an important function of the dusps is to attenuate and dampen the signalling via erks, kinase members of the egf-responsive signalling cascades. thus, egf induces its own feed-back mechanism, presumably to restrain uncontrolled proliferation, motility etc. at the same time, egf induces production of hb-egf and tgfα, ligands of egfr, which are expected to augment and extend the signalling. a similar incongruity is seen at the late time points,  <dig> and 48 h, when both the cell cycle and the apoptosis genes are suppressed by egf. apparently, both positive and negative feedback are induced by egf, and which will prevail may depend on additional, egf-independent signals affecting the keratinocytes.

while keratinocytes in healthy epidermis divide in the basal layer and differentiate as they move outward to the surface of the skin, in wound healing and in various pathological conditions keratinocytes become ‘activated’ – they hyper-proliferate, migrate and elaborate complex defence mechanisms to protect the tissues and the organism beneath
 <cit> . egf is one such keratinocyte activating signal and induces production of proinflammatory and angiogenic cytokines and growth factors. unexpectedly, egf suppresses the production of antibacterial defensins and certain immunomodulators. perhaps, then, the primary function of egf in keratinocyte activation is in wound healing and re-epithelialization, rather than in immune responses and in fighting infection. we find that some of the activation-associated subsets of genes are co-regulated by egf and ifnγ, some by egf and il- <dig> and yet other gene subsets by all there. this reflects the different basic functions of proliferative, inflammatory and immunomodulating cytokines and growth factors.

the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation markers by egf is complex: while the expression of one subset of markers is suppressed, another subset is induced. proliferation and differentiation are incompatible: promoting cell proliferation diverts the cells from differentiating and consequently, certain differentiation markers are suppressed by egf. unexpectedly however, lipid and steroid biosynthesis enzymes are induced by egf. lipids, including steroids, are essential for epidermal barrier function and are necessary for cornification, the final stage of epidermal differentiation. lipid biosynthesis enzymes would not be expected to interfere with cell proliferation, unlike e.g., large keratins or filaggrin, and thus may not be incompatible with the proliferative effects of egf in keratinocytes. while both egf and ra generally inhibit keratinocyte differentiation, paradoxically, at the earliest time points many of the genes induced by one are suppressed by the other and vice versa. only at later time points do egf and ra regulate parallel sets of genes. conversely, sp <dig> and ephrinas promote keratinocyte differentiation. however, the differentiation-associated genes affected by sp <dig> and those affected by ephrinas seem to be targets of different signalling pathways. these results suggest that epidermal differentiation is ‘modular’, not a fully integrated all-or-nothing process; for example, while subsets of differentiation markers are suppressed by egf, other subsets are induced.

importantly, metaanalysis of egf regulation in keratinocytes and other cell types shows important parallel and antiparallel effects. keratinocytes, hela and mcf10a cells show the highest parallelism. all three are epithelial and non-tumorigenic, and in these three cell types signal transduction, proliferation, motility etc. are regulated in parallel. in contrast, in huvec, which are not epithelial but endothelial cells, motility, proliferation and signal transduction are regulated differently. mcf <dig> cell line presents an interesting paradox: it is epithelial but also tumorigenic, migratory and invasive. while some of the early responses to egf are parallel in mcf <dig> cells to those in other epithelial cell types, at late time points they become antiparallel – genes and processes induced by egf in keratinocytes, hela and mcf10a are suppressed in mcf <dig>  and vice versa. these conclusions agree with previous results demonstrating characteristic cytoskeleton proteins, attachment and cell spreading in the mcf <dig> cells
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we present here a paradigm for systems biology approach for integration of disparate sources of transcriptional data. we used the effects of egf in its eponymous tissue, defined the transcriptional profile changes and compared these with transcriptional profile changes in the same cell type by different signalling, and by the same signal in different cell type. the approach can be widely generalized for similar studies.

specifically, we find that egf induces characteristic aspects of keratinocyte activation, comprising proliferation and motility, but not activation of the immune response. these aspects partially overlap the effects of ifnγ and il- <dig>  at the same time, egf suppresses certain aspects of keratinocyte differentiation, namely expression of many known differentiation markers, but not of others, e.g., lipid and steroid biosynthesis enzymes. we conclude that both activation and differentiation of keratinocytes are multifaceted, modular processes, rather than all-or-nothing events, and that distinct, characteristic and overlapping subsets of genes are regulated by different extracellular signals.
