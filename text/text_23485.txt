BACKGROUND
aquaporins  form a superfamily of intrinsic channel proteins and function as diffusion facilitators for water and small molecules such as co <dig>  glycerol, ammonium, and urea cross plasma and intracellular membranes in plant cells . plant aqps are divided into five subgroups consisting of the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins, nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins, small basic intrinsic proteins, and x intrinsic proteins  <cit> . the pips can be further subdivided into pip <dig> and pip <dig>  based on sequence similarity. several pip2s function as water channels, while pip1s have low or no water channel activity, but are associated with water permeability through interacting with pip <dig> .

responses of pip expression to abiotic stresses are variable, with up-, down- or no regulation, depending on species or tissues . most of atpips are less affected by salinity, except for atpip1- <dig> and atpip2- <dig> which are down-regulated in roots and shoots respectively  <cit> . transcripts of atpips are generally down-regulated in leaves upon gradual drought stress, but atpip1- <dig> and atpip2- <dig> transcript levels are up-regulated  <cit> . osmotic water permeability of protoplasts is decreased by down-regulation of certain pip, which leads to a higher susceptibility to drought and osmotic stress , while overexpression of pip genes generally increases root osmotic hydraulic conductivity and transpiration in transgenic plants  <cit> . the transgenic tobacco and arabidopsis plants overexpressing atpip1- <dig> or atpip2- <dig> display enhanced water loss under dehydration stress  <cit> . the responses of pips to water stress and aba are different between upland rice and lowland rice  <cit> . for example, ospip1- <dig> is up-regulated by osmotic stress in highland rice, while ospip1- <dig> transcript is unaltered in lowland rice, indicating that ospip1- <dig> is associated with the differential avoidance to drought in the two varieties  <cit> . salt and drought tolerance are enhanced in transgenic plants overexpressing either ospip1- <dig> or ospip2- <dig>  <cit> . ghpip2- <dig> expression is up-regulated in leaves after drought treatments, and overexpression of ghpip2- <dig> in arabidopsis leads to an enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic plants  <cit> . taaqp <dig>  a wheat pip <dig> gene, is induced by nacl, which involves ethylene and h2o <dig> signaling. overexpression of taaqp <dig> in tobacco increases root elongation under salinity, with increased k+/na+ ratio and ca2+ content and reduced oxidative damages  <cit> .

most of pips subfamily members in arabidopsis thaliana are down-regulated by cold treatment, but atpip2- <dig> is up-regulated  <cit> . overexpression of atpip2- <dig> alleviates the inhibition of low temperature on plant growth in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit>  and facilitates seed germination under cold stress  <cit> . chilling results in decreased expression of some pips in rice seedlings, but higher transcript levels of ospip1- <dig>  ospip2- <dig>  ospip2- <dig> in shoots and ospip1- <dig>  ospip2- <dig> in roots were observed in a chilling-tolerant variety than a chilling-sensitive one during the recovery at room temperature, indicating an important role of pips in re-establishing water balance after chilling conditions  <cit> . ospip1- <dig> plays an important role in chilling tolerance through interacting with members of ospip <dig> subfamily and improving water balance  <cit> .

medicago falcata is closely related to alfalfa , the most important perennial forage legume, with better cold tolerance . higher levels of sucrose, myo-inositol, galactinol, and raffinose family oligosaccharides  are accumulated in falcata than in alfalfa during cold acclimation  <cit> . transcript levels of myo-inositol phosphate synthase , galactinol synthase , and myo-inositol transporter-like  genes are accordingly induced in falcata . in addition, expression of s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  and a temperature induced lipocalin  are also induced by low temperature, and these genes are associated with cold tolerance in falcata plants  <cit> .

in our previous investigation a fragment encoding a pip was harvested in a cdna library of falcata responsive to cold  <cit> , and no other pip genes was found in the library, implying a potential role of the pip in cold tolerance of falcata. we isolated the cold responsive pip from falcata, which was highly homologous to mtpip2- <dig>  however, there is no report on the role of plant pip2- <dig> in regulation of cold tolerance. the objective of this study was to investigate the role of the pip2- <dig> gene  in cold tolerance of falcata. mfpip2- <dig> transcript in response to low temperature was analyzed, and transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing mfpip2- <dig> were generated for examining tolerance to abiotic stresses such as cold and nitrate reduction.

RESULTS
characterization of mfpip2-7
a cdna sequence of mfpip2- <dig>  was cloned from falcata leaves. it contains an open reading frame  of 864 bp  and encodes a deduced polypeptide of  <dig>  kda . sequence blast showed that mfpip2- <dig> was most homologous  in aa sequence to a pip2- <dig>  in m. truncatula. a phylogenetic tree of mfpip2- <dig> and all pips from arabidopsis showed that mfpip2- <dig> is most similar to atpip2- <dig> . a multiple alignments of three pips indicated that six amphipathic channels/transmembrane helices and two signature motifs, which characterize major intrinsic protein, were found in mfpip2- <dig> protein . mfpip2- <dig> was predicted to be localized in plasma membrane using psort prediction  and cross checking with cello v. <dig>  prediction software .

mfpip2- <dig> transcript in response to abiotic stress
no tissue-specific expression of mfpip2- <dig> was observed in falcata plants, although roots had 76 % higher level of mfpip2- <dig> transcript than leaves or stems . mfpip2- <dig> transcript in leaves was initially induced at 4 h and reached to the peak at 8 h after cold treatment, followed by a decline after 12 h . mfpip2- <dig> transcript was also induced by 2 h of aba treatment . aba is signaling in plant adaptation to abiotic stress as well as in cold acclimation of falcata  <cit> . involvement of aba in cold-induced mfpip2- <dig> transcript was examined. the expression of mfpip2- <dig> induced by cold was blocked by pretreatment with naproxen  , inhibitor of aba synthesis  <cit> , indicating that aba were involved in mfpip2- <dig> expression induced by cold.fig.  <dig> tissue-specific expression of mfpip2- <dig> and influence of cold, and abscisic acid  on mfpip2- <dig> transcripts. mature leaflets, stem, and lateral roots were detached from 2-month-old seedlings . plants were exposed to 5 °c in a growth chamber for cold treatment . detached leaves placed in  <dig>  mm aba solution or h2o as control for 12 h , or pretreated in 1 mm naproxen solution for 2 h, followed by 8 h of cold treatment at 5 °c, while those continuously placed in h2o under room temperature were used as non-stressed control . relative expression levels were determined by qrt-pcr and normalized to actin expression. the same letter above a column indicates no significant difference by duncan’s test at p <  <dig> 



analysis of transgenic tobacco plants
dna blot hybridization showed that transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing mfpip2- <dig> had hybridization signals, whereas no cross-hybridization was observed in the wild type, indicating that the transgene was integrated into the genomes of the transgenic tobacco lines . qrt-pcr data showed that mfpip2- <dig> was expressed in transgenic plants .fig.  <dig> analysis of transgenic tobacco plants  overexpressing mfpip2- <dig> in comparison to the wild-type control . fifteen μg of dna from each plant line were digested with hindiii for dna hybridization . relative expression of mfpip2- <dig> was determined by qrt-pcr . survival rate was determined at  <dig> d post recovery at room temperature after plants were treated by freezing at −3 °c for 6 h . photographs were taken before freezing  and  <dig> d post recovery at room temperature after freezing treatment . ion leakage was measured to calculate the temperature that resulted in 50 % lethal . means of three independent samples and standard errors are presented; the same letter above the column indicates no significant difference at p <  <dig> 



freezing tolerance was evaluated using survival rate and lt <dig>  most of the wild type plants could not survive after freezing treatment, while  <dig> to 69 % transgenic plants could survive . compared to a − <dig>  °c of lt <dig> in the wild type, lower levels of lt <dig> were observed in transgenic lines than in the wild type . moreover, the difference in lt <dig> was blocked by pretreatment with dimethylthiourea , a scavenger of h2o <dig>  and dmtu treatment resulted in increased lt <dig> in all plants , indicating that the differential lt <dig> between transgenic plants and the wild type was associated with h2o <dig> 

chilling tolerance was assessed by measuring ion leakage and photosynthesis. both the wild type and transgenic plant had similar levels of ion leakage, maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii , and net photosynthetic rate  under control conditions. chilling led to an enhanced ion leakage and decreased fv/fm and a in all plants, and transgenic plants maintained lower levels of ion leakage and higher levels of fv/fm and a than the wild type .fig.  <dig> analysis of chilling tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants  overexpressing mfpip2- <dig> in comparison to the wild-type control . ion leakage , f

transgenic plants and the wild type showed similar growth on ½ murashige and skoog  medium, which contained 10 mm no3− and was used as a control condition in the study . plant growth declined under conditions of low level of no3−  or without no3− , but transgenic plants had higher levels of plant fresh weight and relative growth than the wild type . for example, relative growth of the wild type on the medium without no3− or containing  <dig>  mm no3− was 31 % and 24 %, respectively, while that of transgenic plants was  <dig> to 44 % and  <dig> to 34 %, respectively, after growing for 8 weeks .fig.  <dig> analysis of plant growth as affected by no3

sensitivity of yeast cells expressing mfpip2- <dig> to externally supplied h2o2
sensitivity of yeast cells transformed with aqp or with an empty vector  to externally supplied h2o <dig> was used to evaluate the permeability of aqp to h2o <dig>  <cit> . yeast cells transformed with mfpip2- <dig> or with an empty showed no difference in growth on the medium containing  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> or without h2o <dig>  however, expression of mfpip2- <dig> markedly reduced growth and cell survival on the medium containing  <dig> or 2 mm h2o <dig> . the reduced growth of yeast expressing mfpip2- <dig> was due to increased oxidative stress as the result of increased uptake of h2o <dig> from the external medium  <cit> . the results suggest that expression of mfpip2- <dig> facilitated h2o <dig> diffusion in yeast cells.fig.  <dig> yeast growth and survival test on medium containing h2o <dig>  after a series of dilution of the yeast cells transformed with either an empty pyes <dig> as control or derivate of pyes <dig> carrying mfpip2- <dig>  at an a600nm of  <dig> , 10 μl was spotted on medium containing various concentrations of h2o <dig> as indicated. growth was recorded after 4 days at 30 °c



abiotic stress responsive genes were induced in transgenic plants
transcripts of abiotic stress responsive genes, such as early response to drought  <dig> , nitrate reductase <dig> , nia <dig>  and dehydration responsive element binding protein , were analyzed using transgenic tobacco plants in comparison to the wild type. higher levels of nterd10b, nterd10c, ntnia <dig>  ntnia <dig>  ntdreb <dig>  and ntdreb <dig> transcripts were observed in transgenic plants than in the wild type , while there was no difference in ntdreb <dig> and  <dig> transcripts between the two type plants . pretreatment with dmtu blocked the difference in transcripts of above genes between the two types of plants , indicating that the higher transcript levels in transgenic plants were associated with h2o <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis of transcript levels of erd10c , erd10b , nia <dig> , and nia <dig> , dreb <dig> , and dreb <dig>  in transgenic tobacco plants in comparison to the wild type. the expression levels were normalized to that of actin using qrt-pcr. means of three repeats and standard errors are presented; the same letter above the column indicates no significant difference at p <  <dig> 



nr activity was higher in leaves than in roots in all plants, while  <dig> to 71 % or  <dig> to 70 % higher activities were observed in leaves or roots of transgenic plants than that in the wild type, respectively . the results were consistent with that transgenic plants had higher transcript levels of nia <dig> and nia <dig> than the wild type.fig.  <dig> nitrate reductase  activities in leaves  and roots  in transgenic plants in comparison to the wild type. means of three repeats and standard errors are presented; the same letter above the column indicates no significant difference at p <  <dig> 



amino acid levels were altered in transgenic plants
significantly higher  level of total free amino acids was observed in roots but not in leaves of the transgenic line 3- <dig> than in the wild type . levels of most of the free amino acids in leaves or/and roots showed significant difference between the transgenic line and the wild type, but there was no difference in glutamic acid and phenylalanine levels . compared to the wild type, significantly higher levels of asparagine, threonine, leucine, tyrosine, tryptophan, lysine, histidine, and ornithine levels were observed in both leaves and roots of transgenic line. in addition, higher levels of proline, arginine, and γ-amino butyric acid, and α-aminoadipic acid and lower levels of serine, glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, and citrulline were observed in leaves, and lower levels of glutamine, isoleucine, phospho-serine were observed in roots of the transgenic line as compared with the wild type .table  <dig> analysis of free amino acid levels  in transgenic plant line  in comparison with the wild type

discussion
an orf encoding mfpip2- <dig> was cloned from falcata. mfpip2- <dig> has the highest aa similarity with mtpip2- <dig> or atpip2- <dig> among pip proteins in m. truncatula or arabidopsis. mfpip2- <dig> transcript was induced by cold and aba treatment. aba is signaling in regulation of downstream stress responses, including expression of multiple down-stream genes with relevance to abiotic stress tolerance . aba is also involved in cold acclimation of falcata  <cit> . in this study, aba was demonstrated to be involved in mfpip2- <dig> expression induced by cold, suggesting that aba-regulated mfpip2- <dig> plays an important role in cold tolerance in falcata.

the role of mfpip2- <dig> in cold tolerance was documented using transgenic plants. overexpression of mfpip2- <dig> resulted in enhanced tolerance to freezing and chilling stresses in transgenic tobacco plants, suggesting that mfpip2- <dig> expression is associated with elevated cold tolerance. similarly, expression of ghpip2- <dig> leads to an improved growth under osmotic stress in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> , while transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing ospip1- <dig> or ospip2- <dig> showed improved root growth under osmotic or salt stress  <cit> . the altered osmotic or drought stress in transgenic plants up- or down-regulating pip genes expression is associated with the increase or decrease in hydraulic conductivity and transpiration . in addition, plant pips function to facilitate h2o <dig> diffusion across plasma membrane apart from as water channels  <cit> . in this study mfpip2- <dig> was found to facilitate h2o <dig> diffusion through expressing in yeast cells. transgenic plants had higher levels of nterd10b, nterd10c, ntnia <dig>  ntnia <dig>  ntdreb <dig>  and ntdreb <dig> transcripts, which were blocked by scavenger of h2o <dig>  suggesting that the high transcript levels in transgenic plants were associated with elevated h2o <dig>  intercellular h2o <dig>  mainly produced by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  oxidase, is an important signal in regulating expression of multiple genes associated with abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . h2o <dig> is also involved in cold and/or drought induced gene expression, such as mfmips and mfsams, in falcata  <cit>  and nia <dig> in tobacco plants  <cit> . ntdreb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> belong to dreb1/cbfs  transcription factors, which are induced in response to cold in tobacco plants  <cit> , while cbfs regulate cold acclimation and expression of cold responsive genes. erd10b and erd10c belong to the dehydrin  family  <cit> . they are induced by drought and cold  <cit> , and protect plant cells against stress induced damages by potent chaperone activity and membrane-binding capacity for increased stabilization of diverse proteins and membrane systems  <cit> . nevertheless, the higher transcript levels of nterd10b, nterd10c, ntdreb <dig>  and ntdreb <dig> in mfpip2- <dig> transgenic plants are associated with the elevated cold tolerance.

it is interesting that ntnia <dig> and ntnia <dig> transcript levels were up-regulated in transgenic plants with dependence upon h2o <dig>  which led to enhanced nr activity in both leaves and roots. nr is a key enzyme in nitrate reduction and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . the elevated nr activity resulted in alterations in free amino acid components and concentrations in transgenic plants, indicating that expression of mfpip2- <dig> influences n metabolism. an elevated concentration of total free amino acids in roots may provide transgenic plants with more nitrogen under no3−-deficiency and thus promote no3−-deficiency tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants. in addition, nr-dependent no production is involved in cold acclimation and freezing tolerance by modulating proline accumulation in arabidopsis  <cit> . apart from proline, many free amino acid concentrations, such as argine, ornithine, and γ-amino butyric acid, were higher in transgenic tobacco than in the wild type. many free amino acids can modulate membrane permeability and ion uptake and function as osmolyte in plants  <cit> . γ-aminobutyric acid is involved in cold acclimation and freezing tolerance in barley and wheat  <cit> . ornithine and argine are the precursor of polyamine biosynthesis, while polyamines are involved in cold tolerance  <cit> . thus the alterations in free amino acid are proposed to be associated with the elevated cold tolerance in transgenic plants.

CONCLUSIONS
mfpip2- <dig> was characterized in this study. mfpip2- <dig> transcript level is induced by cold and aba, while aba is involved in the cold induced expression of mfpip2- <dig>  mfpip2- <dig> showed facilitation of h2o <dig> diffusion in yeast cells. overexpression of mfpip2- <dig> led to enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants, which was associated with the induced expression of stress responsive genes, such as nterd10b, nterd10c, and cbf transcription factors. moreover, the higher levels of ntnia <dig> and ntnia <dig> transcripts and nr activity led to alterations of free amino acid in components and concentrations which are associated with the elevated tolerance to no3−-deficiency and cold.
