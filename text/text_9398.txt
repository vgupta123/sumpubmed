BACKGROUND
in bone diseases such as osteoporosis, it has been observed an increase in the content of bone marrow adipocytes at the expense of bone volume  <cit> . two main explanations were proposed. on the one hand, adipocytes could express antiosteoblastic factors  <cit> . on the other hand, because the both cell types share a common mesenchymal stem cell  progenitor  <cit> , the involvement of a competition between these two differentiation pathways in the decrease of osteoblastic cell population described in osteoporotic bone specimen is often evoked. nevertheless, some data, like independent alterations of bone mineral content and bone marrow adiposity in some mouse models  <cit> , led to discuss more these hypotheses. indeed, several key questions remain to be answered. first, antiosteoblastic factors from adipocytes remain to be identified. second, the mechanism responsible for cell orientation to adipogenic or osteogenic lineage in the bone marrow is still poorly defined  <cit> . third, the competitive relationship between these two pathways in vivo is still discussed particularly because of the existence of independent pre-osteoblastic and pre-adipocytic cell populations in the bone marrow  <cit> .

therefore, the combination of adipogenesis and osteogenesis in primary culture would be helpful not only to identify modulators of the osteoblast/adipocyte balance or to evaluate cell differentiation capacities, but also to determine if the antagonism between adipocytes and osteoblasts, often described on a selected cell population, would be observed in a more heterogeneous population of bone marrow stromal cells .

among molecules used in culture protocols to induce cell differentiation, dexamethasone , a synthetic glucocorticoid, is known to be an important regulator of mesenchymal progenitor cell commitment to osteoblast, adipocyte and chondrocyte lineages. indeed, it has been demonstrated, in many studies, that dex regulates the osteogenesis of human mscs and mineralization in vitro  <cit> . it is also demonstrated that dex has a pro-osteogenic effect on mouse mscs  <cit> .

the involvement of dex in the regulation of human adipogenesis was described in many works  <cit> . it has been shown that in human mscs, continuous dex treatment augmented adipocyte differentiation in adipogenic medium, and osteoblast differentiation in osteogenic medium  <cit> . dex is also used for adipocyte differentiation of mouse bmscs  <cit> . in addition, grigoriadis et al.  <cit>  showed on culture of clonal cell populations from rat calvaria that dex added to osteogenic medium induced adipocytic differentiation while allowing osteoblastic phenotype. thus, we wondered whether dex might be used to allow both osteogenesis and adipogenesis in murine bmscs. therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of different concentrations of dex added to osteogenic medium on adipocytic and osteoblastic differentiation of mouse bmscs. we showed that in this medium only dex at  <dig> nm induced adipocyte phenotype and increased osteoblast phenotype.

RESULTS
addition of dex at  <dig> nm in osteogenic medium strongly induced adipogenesis
to investigate the effect of dex on differentiation, bmscs were cultured for 14 days in osteogenic medium supplemented or not with different amounts of dex ranging from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm. oil red o staining revealed the gradually appearance of lipid droplets in media supplemented with  <dig> and  <dig> nm  while higher doses in osteogenic medium  seemed to decrease the total number of cells during the culture according to microscopic observations. optical density of the extracted oil red o revealed that the presence of dex at  <dig> nm in osteogenic medium induced a higher lipid accumulation than  <dig> nm and even  <dig> nm of dex in the adipogenic medium itself .figure  <dig>

enhancement of adipocyte differentiation in this medium was confirmed by the induction of mrna of early and late differentiation markers ppargamma, glut <dig> , adipoq  and leptin. as shown in figure  <dig>  dex added at  <dig> nm to the osteogenic medium induced the highest adipocyte differentiation because it enhanced the mrna expression of all these markers at the highest level. surprisingly, leptin expression was strongly increased only by dex  <dig> nm in osteogenic medium when compared with all other media. even standard adipogenic medium with dex  <dig> nm did not induce an increase in leptin expression. this was not due to the high concentration of dex because also in a modified adipogenic medium with only  <dig> nm of dex, no increase in leptin expression was observed . this suggests a more complicated regulation of leptin expression in this model.figure  <dig>

to verify that adipocyte marker expression in osteogenic medium supplemented with dex  <dig> nm was not only due to enhancement of some gene promoters by dex, cells were cultured in osteogenic medium for 14 days and  <dig> nm of dex were added only for the last 2 days. this addition of dex did not modify the mrna expression of adipocyte markers when compared to standard osteogenic medium , confirming the full commitment of cells to the adipocyte differentiation pathway in o  <dig> medium.figure  <dig>

addition of dex at  <dig> nm in osteogenic medium also potentiated osteogenesis
the impact of dex on osteoblast differentiation was also determined. alizarin red staining showed that bmscs mineralized in osteogenic medium when dex was added at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nm . interestingly, our results demonstrated that the calcium to protein ratio was higher in osteogenic medium added with dex  <dig> nm than in usual osteogenic medium .figure  <dig>

furthermore, quantitative rt-pcr results demonstrated that when compared to usual osteogenic medium, only  <dig> nm of dex in osteogenic medium induced an up-regulation of osteoblast marker mrna expressions  and osterix ) but without any effect on the expression of the alkaline phosphatase  . we concluded that dex added at  <dig> nm induced the strongest osteoblast differentiation. thus, we selected this concentration for the further experiments performed in co-differentiation medium.

likewise the mrna expression of adipocyte markers, addition of dex  <dig> nm for the last 2 days of the 2 week culture in osteogenic medium did not modify the mrna expression of osteoblast markers . this could indicate that the enhancement of osteoblast markers in co-differentiation medium when compared to osteogenic medium was not only due to a direct effect of dex on some gene promoters.figure  <dig>

to determine if the increased levels of differentiation markers were due to dex effects on cell proliferation, the relative quantification of mrna cyclins  was performed by quantitative rt-pcr after 3/7/10/14 days of culture in growth medium , adipogenic medium with  <dig> nm of dex , osteogenic medium  and co-differentiation medium . dex addition did not alter the mrna level of these cyclins . this suggested that dex does not have any effect on cell proliferation in our model. to strengthen this hypothesis, we performed western blot analysis of cyclin d <dig> . these further experiments showed no obvious differences at the protein level. altogether, these data led us to suppose that in our model, dex acts by inducing higher differentiation levels in the two lineages.figure  <dig>

characterization of mineralization nodules and lipid accumulation by raman microspectroscopy in the co-differentiation medium
to characterize the nodules observed in the co-differentiation medium and to confirm lipid accumulation in functional adipocytes, we used the raman microspectroscopy. in this aim, we determined reference raman spectra of cells differentiated in adipogenic and osteogenic media respectively. indeed, the adipocyte phenotype of cells cultured in adipogenic medium for 14 days was observed by optical image which demonstrated presence of lipid droplets . the reference raman spectra of these cells with lipid droplets showed the presence of characteristic bands of adipocytes as those described in the study of downes et al.  <cit> . these bands were found at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1744 cm− <dig> . they were not detected in undifferentiated cells  and cell support  .figure  <dig>

optical images of cells cultured in co-differentiation medium for 14 days showed the presence of lipid droplets  and nodules  as those observed in adipogenic and osteogenic media respectively. interestingly, the raman analysis confirmed the accumulation of lipids in adipocytes  and the presence of apatitic calcium phosphate  in the co-differentiation medium.

relative localization of adipocytes and mineralized matrix
cultures stained by calcein blue were observed under white light  and uv light  to localize adipocyte cells and mineralized matrix respectively . in co-differentiation medium, adipocytes were often observed very close to mineralized matrix . calcein blue staining of mineralization appeared less intense with usual osteogenic medium . this confirmed results from calcium/protein assays and real time pcr experiments with osteoblastic markers. the very low fluorescent signal observed on cells differentiated in adipogenic medium confirmed the specificity of the fluorescence.figure  <dig>

discussion
mouse mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis and adipogenesis are widely studied separately. the mechanisms and factors driving cells preferentially to one of these differentiation pathways are still discussed or to be identified. because these two phenomena co-exist in the bone marrow, we attempted to reproduce both of them in a single culture condition, for further studies on their interactions.

dex was chosen as a key factor because of its effects on osteoblastic and adipocytic differentiation capabilities  <cit> . interestingly, dex effects were shown to be dependent on cell differentiation stage. indeed, in cells committed to the osteogenic lineage, such as mc3t3-e <dig> and ros 17/ <dig>  cells, dex stimulated osteogenesis  <cit> . the high time dependency of dex effects on mineralization of human preosteoblast  cultures was also demonstrated  <cit> . conversely, in non-committed cells, such as c <dig> cells , dex had a stimulatory action on adipogenesis  <cit> . in addition, it was also demonstrated that dex effects were widely dependent on its concentration. particularly, the number of adipocytic cells derived from mouse bmscs was higher with 10−6 m of dex than with 10−9 m  <cit> . thus, to create an environment in which both osteogenesis and adipogenesis occur, we induced osteogenesis by using a standard osteogenic medium, in which different doses of dex were added to also induce adipogenesis.

bmsc population was chosen because it contains non-differentiated cells and cells partly committed to osteoblast or adipocyte lineages, as shown by the low levels of late differentiation markers of adipocyte  and osteoblast  in cells cultured in growth medium. our results demonstrated that dex at  <dig> nm induced adipogenesis despite the presence of standard osteogenic factors. the emergence of adipocyte-like cells containing lipid droplets was accompanied by a rise in mrna level of early as well as late adipocyte markers . the true adipocyte commitment of these cells was supported by the absence of enhancement of adipocyte markers when dex was added in the osteogenic medium for the last 2 days only.

interestingly, dex addition in osteogenic medium for 14 days also strongly increased the mineralization and the mrna level of osteoblast markers  when compared to cells differentiated in osteogenic medium without dex. we checked that levels of mrna cyclins  were not modified by dex addition . to strengthen the hypothesis that in our model dex does not act through effects on cell proliferation, we performed western blot analysis of cyclin d <dig> which regulates the transition from g <dig> to g <dig> phases of cell cycle. indeed, the results of these experiments suggested that there is no difference in cell proliferation level independently of medium and culture duration. this could be related to the cell culture confluence required in this protocol before inducing cell differentiation. moreover, as for the adipocyte markers, we verified that this increase was not due to the enhancement of some osteoblast gene promoters by dex. our experiments showed that dex added from day  <dig> to day  <dig> of osteoblast differentiation did not modify osteoblast marker mrna levels. these results suggest that the higher levels of osteoblast markers were due to a true increase in osteoblast activity by dex. even though, it could also be supposed that these genes were no more sensitive to dex at late days of osteoblastic differentiation. taken together, all these results show that in our study, dex strongly supported both differentiation pathways in the same culture medium.

despite recent works showing that dex treatment enhanced the alkaline phosphatase  mrna level or activity of c3h10t1/ <dig> cells  <cit>  and rat mesenchymal cells  <cit> , we did not find any difference in alp mrna level between osteogenic medium with dex and osteogenic medium without dex. this result could be explained by the fact that alp is already strongly expressed in the standard osteogenic medium and thus could not be further enhanced by dex addition. indeed, we determined alp mrna levels more than  <dig> folds higher in co-differentiation medium than in growth medium, while in very similar osteogenic experiments only a  <dig> folds increase was shown  <cit> .

in order to characterize the mineralization nodules found in the co-differentiation medium and to confirm lipid accumulation in the adipocytes, we used an original and complementary approach, “the raman microspectroscopy” because it is a non-destructive method. recently, its efficiency to characterize mineral content and to study msc differentiation was shown  <cit> . in our study, raman spectra with bands characteristic of apatitic calcium phosphate and of lipid accumulation were obtained in osteogenic and adipogenic cultures, respectively, and in the co-differentiation medium cultures. these raman data further support the notion that in co-differentiation medium both adipocytes and osteoblasts are formed.

our experiments with staining of mineralized matrix showed that in co-differentiation medium, adipocytes were often observed at proximity of this matrix. this observation led us to suppose that adipocytes and osteoblasts were able to develop in a close proximity. however, further investigations will be needed to determine more precisely the relative localization of adipocytes and mineralized nodules in this medium. moreover, it would be useful to study this topology after several culture durations to establish if adipocytes were differentiated after or before mineralization. to hypothesize on the factors allowing both enhancements in this model, it is to note that whole bone marrow adherent cells were used. these cell populations might include pre-osteoblastic and pre-adipocytic cells as demonstrated by post et al.  <cit> , and by expression of adipocyte and osteoblast marker in growth medium . interestingly, it was previously shown that dex increased the adipocytic differentiation in adipogenic medium and osteoblastic differentiation in osteogenic medium  <cit> , and that dex can enhance expression of osteocalcin and ap <dig>  in cultured rat bmscs  <cit> . taken together, these data lead to suppose that dex potentiates the differentiation of cells already committed to a differentiation pathway.

numerous in vitro studies described the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis of human, rat or mouse cells. some of these studies showed that adipogenic factor addition in the osteogenic medium induced a decrease in osteoblast markers or functions. other studies demonstrated that osteogenic factor addition induced a decrease in adipocyte markers or functions. from these data, authors concluded to a probable direct competition between these two differentiation pathways. moreover, most of these studies were not done on the whole adherent cell population of bone marrow, but on mesenchymal progenitor or pluripotential cell lines. then, another explanation could be that in a selected cell population a strong induction of one pathway compromises the initial one. in the present study, adipocyte lineage does not seem to increase at the expense of the osteoblast lineage, it can be hypothesized that adipocytes are derived from cells that would not be driven to the osteoblast lineage, even in pure osteogenic medium. therefore, in the bone marrow these cells could be mesenchymal cells more or less committed in a non-osteoblastic differentiation pathway. further investigations are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to characterize the underlying mechanisms. despite we have obtained the differentiation of adipocytes and osteoblasts, our model represents some limitations because bmsc cultures do not reproduce the whole niche of bone marrow stroma, niche that remains to be determined.

finally, the highest values of parameters of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation were obtained for the same concentration of dex. this suggests a positive link between the two phenomena in our model. it was previously described that dex enhances leptin release from human adipose tissues  <cit>  and that leptin has a direct pro-osteogenic effect  <cit> . our study showed that leptin expression stayed at the growth medium level when cells were cultured in adipogenic medium with  <dig> or  <dig> nm of dex, but it increased in the co-differentiation medium . first, this led us to suppose the involvement of the direct pro-osteogenic effect of leptin released from adipocytes, added to direct effects of dex. second, these results suggest that adipocytes induced in co-differentiation medium could be different from those induced in adipogenic medium but further investigations will be needed to characterize in greater detail these adipocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary this study demonstrated that the classical osteogenic medium added with  <dig> nm of dex supports adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation of mouse bmscs. the presence of both cell types was confirmed by several approaches. it was also shown that both differentiation lineages are enhanced in this medium when compared to classical adipogenic or osteogenic culture medium.

moreover, this co-differentiation medium offers the opportunity to study bmsc differentiation capacities in an environment allowing both lineages and to study their interaction in great detail. this medium could also allow identifying new modulators of the osteoblast/adipocytes balance.
