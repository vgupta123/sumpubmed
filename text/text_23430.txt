BACKGROUND
the silver homologue gene has been a target for many investigations concerning development of melanosomes, which are the specific pigment carrying compartments within melanophores, e.g. in melanocytes. in humans, silv plays a major role in studies regarding melanoma diagnosis and therapy, because silv is a sensitive melanoma marker on transcript and protein level  <cit>  and represents a melanoma specific antigen recognized by tumor infiltrating cytotoxic t lymphocytes  <cit> . the silv protein also known as pmel <dig>  gp <dig> or me <dig>  <cit>  is crucial for proper formation and maturation of melanosomes. in stage ii melanosomes, processed silv protein aggregates to form fibrils, to which presumably the eumelanin pigment is attached  <cit> . due to its role in melanosome development, silv has also been subject to several studies investigating the genetic background of coat color.

coat color phenotype in mammals is dependent on a series of genes determining distribution of melanocytes , synthesis of the two essential pigments, eumelanin  and phaeomelanin  , and intra- and intercellular transport mechanisms of proteins relevant for coat color expression . in cattle, variants in the mc1r gene result in exclusively eumelaneic  or phaeomelaneic  skin  <cit> . spotted individuals exhibit delimited, white skin areas lacking melanocytes similar to piebald mice  <cit> . similar to other species, dilution loci resulting in a diluted type of the original coat color are known in cattle, e.g. the dilution locus in the charolais breed . the putative role of silv for various coat color dilution loci was described in a number of species, including mouse, dog, chicken, horse, and cattle  <cit> . there is concurring indication that concerning coat color the effect of a mutation in the silv gene in mouse, horses and dogs seems to be restricted to the dilution of eumelaneic pigment. this is underlined by experiments in mice indicating that silv expression seems to be restricted to melanocytes expressing eumelanin  <cit> . in cattle, however, there is still some controversy regarding the potential role of silv in phaeomelanosome development, because up to now there is no unequivocal experimental evidence rejecting or propagating silv mutations as causal background for phaeomelanin dilution  <cit> . first reports on splice variants for the human silv gene  <cit>  and a retroposon insertion in intron  <dig> of the canine silv gene that seems to affect the correct splicing of the gene in merle dogs  <cit>  raise the question whether putative splice variants of the silv gene may be specifically involved in melanosome development. comprehensive studies in humans revealed that alternative splicing is a frequent mechanism altering spatial expression pattern and function of proteins  <cit> .

in the present study, we present a comprehensive description of the complex expression pattern of the bovine silv gene in pigmented and non-pigmented tissues. multiple transcript variants affecting functional key domains of the silv protein indicate that the bovine silv gene may serve as a model for investigations about alternative splicing to generate molecules of obviously deviating function compared to constitutive transcripts.

RESULTS
identification of the silv transcription start site
analysis of several 5'race clones from total rna of eumelaneic, non-dilute  skin indicated a sharp peak of transcription start sites  at position - <dig> bp to the a of the translation start atg of the silv gene . no further promoters were detected. the silv transcription start obtained in this study adds an additional  <dig> bp to the previously deposited bovine silv cdna sequence  <cit> . the cdna sequence generated by this experiment based on cap carrying full length mrna confirmed previous findings about the structure of the bovine silv gene comprising  <dig> bp organized in  <dig> exons  and encoding  <dig> amino acids. aligning the obtained silv cdna sequence with the bovine genomic contig ncbi: nw_ <dig>  <cit> ) indicated that the bovine silv gene spans a total of  <dig> bp with introns sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. a ttata motif representing the putative tata box of the silv promoter is located  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription initiation site.

detection of splice variants
multiple rt-pcr fragments were detected when amplifying silv cdna from rna of eumelaneic , non-diluted skin with primers in the 5' and 3' utr of the silv gene . this diversity of transcripts was also obtained with a primer combination spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  of the bovine silv gene . while the constitutive transcripts  were dominating, further fragments up to  <dig> bp smaller than the constitutive transcript were identified with both primer pairs. in contrast, cloned silv constitutive cdna yielded only the expected  <dig> or  <dig> bp pcr fragment, respectively.

a series of pcr amplifications in silv cdna samples with primers dissecting the transcribed silv sequence into smaller segments enabled a better discrimination of the generated fragments. exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified as putative regions for alternative splicing events, because at least two rt-pcr fragments could be unambiguously discriminated with primer combinations spanning exon  <dig> –  <dig>  and exon  <dig> –  <dig> . in contrast, only single rt-pcr fragments were observed for the primer combinations covering exon  <dig> –  <dig>  exon  <dig> –  <dig>  exon  <dig> –  <dig>  exon  <dig> –  <dig> and exon  <dig> –  <dig>  notably, all identified fragments were present in all differentially pigmented skin samples investigated . our data show that the expression of the bovine silv gene is not restricted to eumelaneic , non-dilute  skin, but also occurs in skin expressing exclusively phaeomelanin. furthermore, also white skin sections of spotted individuals with eumelaneic or phaeomelaneic background showed silv gene expression as well as the crème white skin of a eumelaneic homozygous dilute dcd/dcd individual.

the silv transcripts additional to the constitutive fragment that had been identified by rt-pcr were isolated from the agarose gel and sequenced to reveal the specific dna sequence of the different fragments. alignment of the obtained sequences to the reference constitutive cdna  showed that the additional silv transcripts lacked different parts of the silv mrna . with primers spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> , three alternative transcripts  were characterized: Δ660– <dig> lacking  <dig> bp corresponding to the entire exon  <dig>  Δ816– <dig> lacking  <dig> bp from the 3' end of exon  <dig> and Δ1185– <dig> lacking  <dig> bp from the 3' end of exon  <dig>  with primers spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> , we obtained an alternative transcript Δ1655– <dig> lacking  <dig> bp from the 3' end of exon  <dig>  furthermore, sequencing of an additional rt-pcr transcript amplified with primers from exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  detected a silv cdna Δ498–1340/Δ1655– <dig> lacking exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> and  <dig> bp from the 3' end of exon  <dig> .

diversity in silv transcripts was also confirmed in the course of our 5'race experiments. several clones containing inserts smaller than the expected size  were detected. sequencing of the respective clones revealed silv cdnas starting from the identified transcription start, but devoid of distinct other regions in the remaining silv mrna. on the one hand, we received transcripts confirming already detected alternative splice variants e.g., Δ498– <dig>  Δ660– <dig>  Δ816– <dig>  and Δ1185– <dig>  additionally, we identified two further internal splice sites generating a transcript Δ105– <dig> /Δ1332– <dig> .

in order to obtain indication whether combinations of alternative splicing events occurred, we sequenced a collection of clones from a plasmid library containing silv rt-pcr products of variable size generated by cdna amplification of eumelaneic , non-dilute  skin with primers spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> . alignment of the generated sequences to the silv constitutive transcript confirmed previously detected transcripts and yielded an additional new series of transcripts  with deleted exons: Δ <dig> –  <dig> , Δ <dig> –  <dig>  and Δ <dig> –  <dig> .

only some alternative internal splice sites completely conformed to the gt-ag rule for splice donor and splice acceptor sites. notably, the alternative splice sites did not affect the reading frame of the transcript except for Δ498–1340/Δ1655– <dig>  in the transcript Δ498–1340/Δ1655– <dig>  a premature stop codon is generated at position c. <dig> 

confirmation of silv splice variants in differentially pigmented skin
in order to confirm alternative splice sites in the bovine silv gene, we developed splice variant specific rt-pcr tests for an exemplary subset of the detected splice variants . splice variant profiling revealed the alternative splice variants Δ498– <dig>  Δ816– <dig> and Δ1185– <dig> in all differentially pigmented skins . in contrast, we obtained a specific pattern for Δ105– <dig>  which was not detected in non-pigmented, white skin of spotted individuals heterozygous for the dilute locus  regardless whether on a eumelaneic or a phaeomelaneic background. notably, non-pigmented white skin of a spotted, homozygous non-dilute  individual exhibited this splice site albeit at a lower level than the pigmented counterpart. skin with a crème white coat color characteristic for individuals homozygous at the dilution locus dcd/dcd also displayed the alternative splicing Δ105- <dig>  it has to be noted that crème white skin has an essentially pigmented background with melanocytes  <cit> , however, pigmentation is diluted to almost invisibility. in contrast, non-pigmented skin of spotted or piebald individuals is devoid of melanocytes resulting in a white coat color  <cit> .

analysis of tissue specific silv gene expression
rt-pcr revealed a specific expression of the bovine silv gene in all  <dig> investigated tissues from an adult individual: pituitary gland, thyroid gland, kidney, adrenal gland, liver, lung, heart, brain, rumen, intestinal fat, subcutaneous fat, perirenal fat, mammary gland, duodenum, colon, jejunum, skeletal muscle. all three silv primer combinations tested spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> , exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  confirmed this observation . the relative amount as indicated by semi-quantitative rt-pcr differed between tissues: a strong silv expression equivalent to skin was seen in a number of tissues with very divergent functions, e.g. thyroid gland and colon, whereas silv was only weakly expressed in brain, muscle and fat tissues . analysis with primers spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  revealed at least two pcr fragments for all tissues with a pattern similar to that obtained for differentially pigmented skin tissues.

while alternative splice variants were rather uniformly distributed across the differentially pigmented skins, substantial variation was seen for the other tissues . only transcript variant Δ105– <dig> was tissue-specific for skin. whereas splice variant Δ816– <dig> could be detected in all seven tissues tested , Δ1185– <dig> was only found in mammary gland at a low level.

discussion
structure of the bovine silv gene
the bovine silv gene shows a strong structural homology with the respective gene in human and mouse. the bovine mrna  is separated into  <dig> exons and revealed a homology of 87% to the human  and 83% to mouse mrna . at protein level, the similarities were  <dig> or 73%, respectively. the sharp peak of transcription start sites detected in cap finding race experiments and the putative tata box of the silv promoter located  <dig> bp upstream correspond to the classical pattern of tata box promoter architecture characteristic for genes highly conserved in evolution  <cit> . our race experiments in the eumelaneic  non-dilute  skin yielded essentially an identical transcription start compared to a silv mrna obtained by 5'race from a homozygous dilute , crème-white skin  <cit> . thus, the use of alternative transcription starts can be formally excluded as the background for differences in coat color between dilute and non-dilute individuals.

silv transcription in phaeomelaneic and non-pigmented tissues
taking advantage of our animal model with individuals expressing exclusively eumelanin or phaeomelanin, our rt-pcr results prove that in cattle silv expression in skin is not restricted to areas with eumelanocytes, because we also found silv transcripts in phaeomelaneic and non-melaneic skin. this result is in contrast to previous reports in mice  <cit>  indicating that silv expression could only be detected in cells synthesizing eumelanin. whereas there are many studies about the melanophore-specific expression of silv in the literature , only one report in humans also describes silv to be ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . this result is supported by  <dig> ests isolated from non-pigmented tissues in a total of  <dig> human silv ests listed in the ncbi unigene database  <cit> ). although no conclusion regarding silv transcription can be drawn from bovine unigene data base entries, our own experiments clearly reject the hypothesis that silv expression is specific to eumelanocytes in cattle. expression outside of pigmented tissues indicates that products of the bovine silv gene seem to have a new, up to now unknown function additional to fibril formation in the course of melanosome development. chakraborty et al. postulate a catalytic role of silv in melanin synthesis  <cit> . but as melanin synthesis is restricted to melanophores in skin, uvea and other pigmented tissues  <cit> , involvement of silv in melanin synthesis would not explain silv expression in tissues without melanophores. consequently, the additional role of silv expression postulated from our study has to exceed melanophore specific functions. up to now, it is completely unclear, which role silv transcription may play in e.g. thyroid gland or colon, two tissues with extremely different cell type composition, for which a high silv expression was detected in our experiments. if indeed human silv expression is also not restricted to melanophores as indicated by  <cit> , cattle may serve as an appropriate model to investigate its potential function in non-melanophores.

alternative splicing in silv affecting functionally relevant domains
rt-pcr with an overlapping panel of primer pairs indicated nine alterative splice sites in the bovine silv gene resulting in splicing of cryptic introns predominantly affecting exon  <dig>  but also exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and exon  <dig>  thus, the splicing pattern comprises the use of single or combined cassette exons and alternative 5' splice sites resulting predominantly in deletions of single or multiple exons, which is in line with other comprehensive studies investigating alternative splicing  <cit> . sequence alignment of the bovine silv cdna with the nine cattle ests homologous to silv, which are deposited in the unigene database  <cit> , did not indicate alternative splicing. however, the confirmed alternative silv transcripts in cattle from our study are in line with previous experiments in humans describing two alternative splice sites in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of the silv gene  <cit> . the extent of alternative splicing seen in cattle exceeds the number of published alternative transcripts in humans substantially, and we even cannot exclude that further splice variation is present in cattle. the alternative splicing database  <cit>  collecting electronic data on constitutive and alternative transcripts lists entries exclusively for human silv and indicates that the number of alternative transcripts in humans is also presumably higher than presently considered. interestingly, humans and cattle are the only species for which alternative transcripts have been experimentally established  <cit> . no additional transcripts are published e.g. in mice.

comparative analysis of the bovine silv protein with the respective counterpart in human according  <cit>  suggested that several functional domains of the silv protein as defined by  <cit>  should be affected by alternative splicing in cattle. splice variant Δ105– <dig> characterized by the complete skipping of exons  <dig> and  <dig> results in loss of the proximal part of the n terminal domain  of the bovine silv protein. thus, skipping of exons  <dig> and  <dig> would affect the posttranslational modification of the protein substantially, because the ntd carries the majority of silvs' glycosylation sites as reviewed by  <cit> . the alternative transcripts Δ363– <dig>  Δ498– <dig> and Δ660– <dig> lack  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> amino acids of the constitutive transcript, respectively, representing the c terminal part of the n terminal domain and the entire polycystic kidney disease  and repeat  domains. while the pkd has an immunoglobulin folding structure and is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions, the rpt domains seems to be necessary for fibril formation in melanosomes  <cit> . the entire rpt domain is also missing in the Δ816– <dig> transcript in addition to the distal pkd domain. transcript Δ1185– <dig> lacks the distal part of the rpt domain, whereas Δ1332– <dig> is devoid of  <dig> amino acids of the gap <dig> domain. splice variant Δ1655– <dig> is the only transcript with a disrupted reading frame and a premature stop codon generating a truncated protein without transmembrane and c terminal domain or possibly inducing a nonsense-mediated mrna decay  <cit> . while the kringle-like domain and the transmembrane domain seem to be rather invariable, the rpt domain is most frequently affected by the different splice variants in our data set. experiments with human silv deletion constructs showed that a protein lacking the repeat domain  showed an appropriate intracellular trafficking  <cit> . however, hela cells overexpressing Δrpt silv formed only abnormal fibrils, indicating that the rpt domain plays a crucial role in the development of the striated fibrillar structure in melanosomes. hoashi et al.  <cit>  used hmb <dig>  an antibody frequently employed for melanoma diagnostic as a probe specific for melanosomal fibrils and showed that its epitope is located in the second and third amino acid repeat of the rpt domain. thus, bovine transcripts lacking the respective part of the rpt domain  should not be able to form intact fibrils, a process central to appropriate melanosome development as determined for human silv. interestingly, the two of the four isoforms of silv in humans due to alternative splicing also affect the rpt domain albeit not the epitope for hmb <dig>  <cit> . the alternative splice variants lacking entire functional domains as confirmed for the bovine silv gene represent ideal candidates for further study into the potential effects of alternative splicing on function  <cit> .

variation in alternative splicing of silv with respect to coat color phenotype
in cattle, we did not find any mutation in the coding silv sequence that could convincingly be associated with phaeomelanin coat color dilution in a f <dig> resource population based on the charolais and the holstein breed  <cit> . in dogs, clark et al.,  <cit>  described a mutation in intron  <dig> of the canine silv gene that was associated with coat color dilution and concluded that the mutation might impair correct splicing of the canine silv transcript. thus, another as yet undetected mutation in the genomic sequence of the bovine silv gene could possibly affect the structure of the silv mrna, representing the genetic background for phaeomelanin dilution in cattle. because we could confirm silv expression in eumelaneic and also phaeomelaneic skin, any genetic variant affecting regulation or coding structure of the gene might theoretically also affect phaeomelanin dilution in cattle, although presently there is no indication, which function silv may exert on maturation of phaeomelanosomes. thus, given our expression data the silv gene could not formally be rejected as the background for phaeomelanin dilution in cattle. however, neither the transcription start, which was conserved between homozygous dilute  and non-dilute  individuals, nor the distribution of splice variants in the differentially pigmented skins, convincingly explained the differences in dilution phenotype. hence, there is no indication that variation in the primary sequence of the silv protein either due to variation in the coding sequence or due to alternative splicing is responsible for dilution of phaeomelanin in cattle.

whereas the pattern of transcript variants is rather similar across the panel of differentially pigmented skin, the variability of splice variants detected in other tissues points towards a tissue specific splicing mechanism. this may represent a tool for adapting silv expression to the requirements of the respective cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although the structure of the silv gene is conserved across a variety of species including cattle, its pattern of transcription shows substantial differences regarding alternative splicing between cattle and human on the one side and mice on the other. our experiments provide evidence for a ubiquitous transcription of the bovine silv gene not restricted to pigmented cells and show a striking variety of alternative splice sites. these results indicate that potentially silv may have functions exceeding melanosome development. this would have to be considered in future investigations concerning melanoma diagnostic and therapy and also in studies taking silv as a model for amyloid formation  <cit>  or for intracellular transport mechanisms. the similarity in expression pattern compared to human and the variety of alternative transcripts predestine bovine silv as an adequate animal model.

whereas alternative splicing is a well established regulatory mechanism for gene expression  <cit> , the confirmed alternative silv transcripts are in line with the hypothesis of the new postulated additional silv functions exceeding synthesis and deposition of melanin. this hypothesis is supported by the detection of silv transcripts in non-melanophores in our study. however, it has to be considered that our analyses are restricted to the transcription level. thus, subsequent steps modulating silv expression due to e.g. nonsense mediated decay  <cit>  and translational and posttranslational modification require further investigation to confirm the postulated additional functions of the silv gene. due to its extensive, up to now unique pattern of alternative splicing, bovine splice variants represent a naturally occurring model for the function of the domains located in the spliced regions of the silv and for the alternative functions postulated for silv. furthermore, factors regulating the processes of alternative splicing in the different tissues can be investigated exemplarily.
