BACKGROUND
the galliformes, a well-known and widely distributed order in aves, contains about  <dig> genera and more than  <dig> species including the domestic chicken , green peacock  and turkey , among others. many galliforms have beautiful ornamentations and they play an important role in hunting and entertainment. regardless, these birds are best known for their importance in agriculture and as model organisms in scientific studies  <cit> .

the phylogenetic relationships of galliforms have long been the focus of research  <cit> . traditionally, the galliformes contained seven families: megapodiidae , cracidae , tetraonidae , meleagrididae , numididae , odontophoridae  and phasianidae . phasianids formed the most diverse and complex group, including two lineages: the pheasants and old world partridges . the pheasants were further divided into four lineages: peafowls, gallopheasants, junglefowls and tragopans  <cit>  . however, this taxonomy was not supported by recent molecular and morphological analyses , which failed to obtain a consistent result and added more fuel to an already heated debate.

mitochondrial dna analyses revealed that gallus , francolinus  and bambusicola  clustered together, suggesting that pheasants and partridges were not monophyletic groups  <cit> . subsequently, these findings were supported by the analyses of nuclear gene sequences  <cit> , combined mt genes and nuclear gene sequences   <cit>  and sequences from retrotransposable elements   <cit> . however, one morphological study  <cit>  conflicted with these assessments . the phylogenetic relationships within the galliformes, and especially the unsolved branching order in the phasianidae, limited interpretations of their morphological and ecological convergent evolution. the absence of a phylogeny also impacted on conservation initiatives.

internal nodes resolved by previous studies were generally very short. further, bootstrap support values were very low and many species had unresolved relationships, suggesting a rapid radiation of the phasianidae  <cit> . although the resolution of branching orders during a rapid radiation has proven to be challenging, large dna sequence datasets have a much higher probability of recovering a robust tree  <cit> .

recently, mt genomes have been widely used to reconstruct intractable phylogenies  <cit> . in general, mtdna accumulates mutations at a relatively faster rate than nuclear dna, thus making it particularly useful for revealing closely spaced branching events. considering that previous phylogenetic studies based on a single gene or a few genes failed to resolve the internal branching orders within the galliformes, we sequenced the complete mt genomes of  <dig> galliform birds, and obtained other mt genomes from genbank . consequently, we used extensive mt genomes from major groups of galliform birds to infer their phylogenetic relationships.

RESULTS
characteristics of the mitochondrial genome
the general characteristics of mt genomes of  <dig> galliforms and six anserforms are summarized in additional file  <dig>  the lengths of the complete mt genomes range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. length differences are mainly due to variation in the control region . the overall average nucleotide composition was a =  <dig> %, c =  <dig> %, g =  <dig> % and t =  <dig> %. all mitochondrial gene organizations conformed to the standard avian gene order   <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships
tests for stationarity of base composition among the taxa for each mt gene revealed that the galliformes did not differ significantly in their base content . only alectoris chukar for coxi and nd <dig>  alectoris lathami for nd <dig>  and bonasa bonasia for coxii, nd <dig> and nd <dig> differed marginally significantly. however, all five outgroup taxa failed the stationarity tests for some data partitions as follows: anas platyrhynchos for coxi, cr, nd <dig> and nd5; anser albifrons for cr, nd <dig> and nd5; anseranas semipalmata for cr; aythya americana for coxi, cr, nd <dig> and nd5; branta canadensis for coxi, cr and nd5; and cygnus columbianus for cr . in summary, cr had the greatest number of cases  that deviated from stationarity, and anas platyrhynchos and aythya americana deviated from stationarity most frequently .

because we mainly used the combined sequences to reconstruct the tree, we also calculated base composition for the  <dig> protein-coding gene set . we found that base composition was not significantly different in codon positions  <dig> and  <dig> among galliformes, while for codon position  <dig>  some species departed from the average composition.

the combined dataset of  <dig> protein-coding genes  revealed a single, robust tree using mp and ml, and bi produced a summary of numerous trees  for the galliformes. the megapodiidae was the sister group of the remaining taxa, followed by the numididae. the remaining clade formed a complex mixture involving the families tetraonidae, meleagrididae and phasianidae. the phasianidae contained seven lineages, each with very high bsps as follows: group  <dig> contained arborophila; group  <dig> included tragopan, lophophorus and tetraophasis; group  <dig> was composed of chrysolophus, phasianus, lophura, and syrmaticus; group  <dig> contained perdix; group  <dig> had pucrasia; group  <dig> held gallus, bambusicola and francolinus; and group  <dig> contained coturnix and alectoris. a clade containing families tetraonidae and meleagrididae branched off from within the phasianidae. only the phylogenetic relationships of pavo and polyplectron remained unresolved .

in order to investigate the possibility of a bias owing to substitution saturation, we plotted transitions and transversions against pairwise sequence divergence using  <dig> mt protein-coding genes . codon positions  <dig> and  <dig> were not saturated. codon position  <dig> was saturated for transitions in the comparison between the galliformes and outgroups. in addition, some species departed from the average base composition in codon position  <dig> . in order to reduce the possible influence of these two biases on codon position  <dig>  we implemented p <dig> and ry-coding methods. the resulting tree topologies were identical to those of the unweighted schemes. as expected, relatively lower bootstraps values were obtained . better resolution and higher bsps were obtained from dna datasets that included all substitutions, as opposed to those subjected to weighting.

both of the combined rna datasets  obtained less resolution compared to protein-coding genes . the aligned rrna sequences  were  <dig>  aligned sites in length. the trna dataset  contained  <dig>  bp of aligned sites. the individual partitions  showed very limited power for phylogenetic inference, leaving many unresolved nodes .

to maximize the amount of phylogenetic information, we pooled all mt genes  to form a single dataset with a length of  <dig>  aligned sites for a genomic-level phylogeny  <cit> . the bi analysis yielded a topology identical to that produced by the combined  <dig> protein-coding genes, except for the phylogenetic position of polyplectron, which did not cluster with the peafowl, but rooted at the base of the phasianidae, implying non-monophyly of peafowl .

regarding the phylogenetic positions of the cracidae and odontophoridae, the bi trees based on  <dig>  nucleotide positions  and  <dig>  positions  were very similar to those attained from complete mt genomes . as expected, some nodes received relatively low statistical support.

assessing the performance of individual genes
pbs analyses were performed to better understand the contribution of different parts of the mt genome on the genome phylogeny. among the  <dig> partitions examined, nd <dig> provided the greatest contribution to tree resolution, followed by cr, while atp <dig> contributed the least . in the analyses of pbs values per nucleotide base pair, cr performed the best and atp <dig> was the worst .

discussion
the rapid radiation and convergent morphological evolution has confounded the resolution of relationships for many pheasants and partridges. most previous molecular studies analyzed either one or a few mt genes  <cit>  only or a single nuclear gene  <cit> . the paucity of data rendered the sequence of cladogenic events, especially within the family phasianidae, unsolved. in this study, we showed that the number of genes, and thus the quantity of data, proved critical to resolving relationships. individual genes had limited power to resolve the phylogeny of this group . in contrast, the complete mt genomes clearly resolved most of the branching order within the pheasants and partridges, with strong nodal support.

at the base of the tree, alectura lathami was the sister taxon of all other galliforms, followed in sequence by the cracids, new world quails and guineafowls, and then a clade including the phasianidae, the tetraonidae and the meleagrididae . this branching order was the same as obtained by some studies  <cit> , yet other studies switched the positions of new world quails and guineafowl  <cit> . unlike most previous studies based on morphology  <cit> , a single nuclear gene  <cit> , single mitochondrial gene  <cit> , or retrotransposable elements  <cit> , we obtained clear branching orders within the phasianidae. arborophila was the sister group to all other phasianids plus the meleagrididae and tetraonidae. whereas the evolutionary relationships of perdix remained unresolved in previous studies, in our study it clustered with the gallopheasants, and with strong nodal support . tetraophasis clustered independently with lophophorus and their sister group was tragopan; this association also enjoyed very high nodal support. and arborophila did not cluster with other partridges. therefore, the non-monophyly of the pheasants and partridges was more common than not, including the strongly supported association of gallus, bambusicola and francolinus. polyplectron did not cluster with pavo, and pucrasia did not cluster with other tragopans. these associations revealed that the peafowl and tragopan lineages were not monophyletic.

our study and that of kimball and braun  <dig> , based on combined data including two mt genes  and four nuclear introns , were similar in some respects, but have many differences. for example, within gallus, they resolved the species relationships as  g. gallus) g. sonneratti) and our ml and bi analyses resolved them as  ). whereas no nodal support was obtained in the former set of relationships, our ml and bi trees were strongly supported at each node . kimball and braun placed polyplectron as the sister group to gallus and bambusicola but with less than 50% support values, yet all of our analyses located polyplectron near the base of the clade for the phasianidae . other discrepancies also occurred, such as the position of pavo, perdix and pucrasia, and all of these differences received high support in our study.

our study resolved many differences compared to trees based on retrotransposable elements   <cit> . these studies placed gallus near the base of the clade for the phasianidae, followed by pavo, and the remaining taxa split into two groups:  coturnix and  gallopheasants, tragopans, turkey and grouse. in contrast, our analyses did not place gallus near the base of the phasianidae, but rather clustered it with coturnix. this pair then clustered with pavo, which then became the sister group of gallopheasants, tragopans, turkey and grouse . although kriegs et al.  did not resolve the position of the tragopans, we found them to be the sister group of the gallopheasants, and with very high support . studies of retrotransposable elements resolved the branching orders of seven families of galliformes, however, many unsolved parallel relationships remained in the phasianidae . thus, retrotransposable elements were good markers to resolve relationships at the hierarchical levels of family, but seemed to be less powerful at resolving detailed relationships at the hierarchical levels of genus and species. in contrast, mt genomes were very informative at the level of genus/species, due to their relatively rapid rate of mutation.

relative branch lengths suggest this group has undergone ancient, rapid radiations. branching order is difficult to resolve during rapid radiations because of insufficient time for numerous genetic and morphological changes to accumulate  <cit> . clearly, our combined mt genomes provide a greater abundance of information and thus may have a greater likelihood of fully resolving a tree than individual protein-coding genes and other subsets of mt genes .

because sequencing the complete mt genomes is expensive in both time and resources, the relative performance of individual genes is of great interest. ranking individual genes by their respective contribution to the total pbs values--a rough indicator of phylogenetic utility--reveals that some genes, such as nd <dig>  cr, nd <dig>  coxi and 16s, are better indicators of galliform evolution than others . longer genes tend to have more informative sites, and thus a larger total pbs. pbs value per nucleotide base pair can be used to maximize tree-acquisition efficiency. for galliform birds, nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  atp <dig>  and nd <dig> are more informative than other mt genes . pbs values can be used with gene length, ease of amplification and sequencing to select a suite of genes for phylogenetic inference, especially given that different suites of genes may provide more information as a function of the tempo of evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
our robust mitogenomic tree indicates that galliform relationships are very complex. the traditional hypothesis of monophyletic lineages of pheasants, partridges, peafowls and tragopans is not supported in this study. mitogenomics is a powerful tool for resolving the phylogenetic relationships of the galliformes. individual mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes seem to be less powerful in resolving phylogenetic relationships within the galliformes, especially the phasianidae. clearly, complete mt genomes can provide more information, and thus are more powerful arbitrators of ambiguous phylogenetic relationships than partial genomes. therefore, this strategy should serve to further resolve the phylogeny of the galliformes as more mt genomes are obtained. given the diversity of species in the galliformes, and these birds' great complexity in morphological and behavior characters, such as flight, polygamy and sexual dimorphism, this order can serve as an ideal model for a detailed study of character evolution. thus, our study not only hypothesizes an evolutionary history of the galliformes, it also provides primary genetic data for future studies. a caveat of this study is that, our tree tells us a part of story due to the only matrilineal heredity of mtdna. in particular, our topology conflicts with that derived from nuclear dna  retrotransposable elements  <cit> . these conflicts may be due to the different modes of heredity, and different tempos of evolution of mtdna and nudna. further study is required to resolve the current conflicts.
