BACKGROUND
globular proteins are critical players in the cell whose function is dictated by their characteristic structure. because the number of proteins with known sequence far exceeds the number with known structure, the ability of computational methods to predict the structure from sequence is considered extremely valuable to investigate their functional properties  <cit> . proper valuation of the quality of models is the basic problem of any computational approach to structure prediction. a basic difference between experimental and computational approaches to solve the 3d structure of proteins is that x-ray or nmr protocols start from high protein concentration conditions, while "ab initio" predictive methods run on a single protein molecule. this means that most predictive methods can not take into account the strong influence of environment on the globular structure of the protein. fundamental features for determining the globularity are solubility, packing stability, folding, and compactness  <cit> . therefore, to improve the quality of protein structure prediction, their effects should be simulated. as an alternative, at least to evaluate the quality of the predictions, it is necessary to know whether the structural properties typical of globular proteins are retained also by theoretical models.

in  <dig> pauling was the first to consider the importance of the intra-molecular h-bonds in protein structures, emphasizing their role in stabilizing the alpha-helices and beta-strands  <cit> . many studies have pointed out that h-bonds contribute favorably to globular protein stability  <cit> . also important in understanding protein globularity is the packing of the protein atoms . protein cavities or packing defects occur with relative abundance, both within and between folding units, and the creation or filling of such cavities affects protein stability and structure, disturbing core packing  <cit> . moreover, the variation of atom packing in a data set of globular proteins can be due to a complex combination of protein size and secondary structure, and amino acid composition  <cit> . these differences in protein packing are conserved in protein families of similar structure; the modeling of protein structures based on homologous templates should take into account the packing of the template structure. however, the prediction of protein models obtained by "ab-initio" methods is much more difficult, since there is no template structure as reference. in these cases, and in general for all predicted models, we should always control those parameters able to confirm that the obtained structures have the typical properties of globular proteins. a search of the scientific literature found only two methods that make predictions for globularity, and both are sequence-based rather than structure-based  <cit> .

therefore, we first studied and analyzed a valuable set of experimental protein structures belonging to the four known structural classes  in terms of h-bonds, voids, solvent-accessible surface area, and water molecules in a layer of  <dig> Ångstroms. this analysis allowed us to deduce structural parameters useful in determining the protein globularity and to define operative criteria to evaluate models, particularly those predicted by "ab-initio" methods. these structural parameters were combined together as an index of globularity by which we tested thirteen sets of models submitted to casp <dig> protein structure prediction experiment in the new fold  and difficult fold recognition analogous  categories.

RESULTS
protein set selection
protein structures, solved by nmr or x-ray crystallography with resolution of  <dig>  Å or better, were extracted from pdbselect  <cit> . these proteins were subdivided into four structural classes, i.e. "mainly alpha", "mainly beta", "alpha/beta" and "alpha+beta", on the bases of secondary structures assigned by dssp program and of the scop database to classify the alpha-beta proteins as alpha+beta or alpha/beta  <cit> . table  <dig> reports the number of structures comprised in each set and the mean ratios between the residue number in helix, in beta-strands and in "coil", and the total residue number. these structures were analyzed in terms of h-bonds, accessible surface area, water molecules and voids, in order to define some typical parameters for each protein structural class.

hydrogen bonding
the h-bonds in these protein structures were evaluated using the hbplus package and classified as main-chain donor to main-chain acceptor , main-chain donor to side-chain acceptor , side-chain donor to main-chain acceptor  and side-chain donor to side-chain acceptor . the total number of h-bonds ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> in "mainly-alpha",  <dig> and  <dig> in "mainly-beta",  <dig> and  <dig> in "alpha+beta" and  <dig> and  <dig> in "alpha/beta" proteins. the correlation coefficients between the total number of h-bonds or mm-, ms-, sm- and ss-type h-bonds are reported in table  <dig>  the total number of mm-type h-bonds increased linearly with the molecular weight of selected proteins belonging to all four protein sets . the mean ratios between mm-, ms-, sm- or ss-type h-bonds and the total number of h-bonds were evaluated and are reported in table 3a.

accessible surface area
for each selected structure the total accessible surface area was evaluated by summing the related polar and non-polar components. the total area accessible to solvent increased in a linear way with the protein molecular weights  with correlation coefficients higher than  <dig>  in all four structural classes . the mean ratios between non-polar accessibility value and the related total accessibility are reported in table 3b.

water molecules
a layer of  <dig> Å around each protein was considered, and the number of water molecules and of h-bonds between the water molecules and the protein residues was evaluated. the number of water molecules increased linearly with the molecular weight of the proteins in all four sets with correlation coefficients higher than  <dig>  .

void analysis
the avp program was run on the four protein sets using two different probes: the first to identify the holes in the interior of a protein  and the second to delimit the solvent accessible regions on the surface . the total void volume is obtained summing the total buried and surface void volumes. this increased linearly with the protein size with correlation coefficients higher than  <dig>  , according to fleming and richards  <cit> . the mean ratios between the total surface and buried void volumes and the total void volume are reported in table 3c.

score value for training proteins
by using the corresponding linear regression equations obtained for the structural parameters , we computed a score for each protein . the score value increases if the protein properties are well outside the expected values. for each protein set, we determined the threshold  value as the score which includes 90% of the examined proteins. the threshold value was found to be  <dig>  in the case of "mainly-alpha" and "mainly-beta" proteins, and  <dig>  for "alpha/beta" and "alpha+beta" proteins. the remaining 10% of analyzed structures presents long amino acid segments in irregular secondary structure at the beginning or end of the chain, which might explain their higher score value. these score values were then similarly computed to evaluate the structural quality of the theoretical protein models.

testing protein evaluation
targets from the casp <dig> experiment were selected as a testing set, choosing only full-chain structures . the list of the thirteen target models selected is reported in table  <dig>  these models were analyzed using the procedure reported above and their score values were calculated. of the total number of models  <dig> %  showed scores higher than the threshold value, indicating that a large number of the theoretical models submitted to the casp competition do not agree with the expected globularity features. it should also be noted that all those models considered to be the best submitted for each target  <cit> , as well as the relative experimental structures deposited in pdb, had score values lower than the threshold value . this confirms the quality of the best theoretical models submitted to the competition, and likewise confirms the reliability of our evaluation score.

discussion
in this work four sets of protein structures were selected from the pdb, classified as "mainly-alpha", "mainly-beta", "alpha+beta" and "alpha/beta"  and analyzed in terms of h-bonds, void number, solvent-accessible surface area and water molecules, comprised in a layer of  <dig> Ångstroms.

the mean ratios between mm-, ms-, sm- or ss-type h-bonds and the total number of h-bonds, reported in table 3a, indicated that the mm-type h-bonds were the most frequent in all four structural classes. this agreed with the previous analysis applied to a set of globular proteins, which had found that most h-bonds were local and situated between backbone atoms in proteins, and that almost all were within single elements of the secondary structure  <cit> . the total number of mm-type h-bonds increased linearly with the molecular weight of selected proteins with correlation coefficients higher than  <dig>  in "mainly-alpha", "alpha+beta" and "alpha/beta" proteins . in "mainly-beta" proteins the total number of h-bonds was smaller than in other sets, with the correlation coefficient between the mm-type h-bonds and the protein molecular weights found to be  <dig> . this smaller value could depend on the higher content of irregular secondary structure in "mainly-beta" proteins .

the total accessible surface area , with its polar and non-polar components, was evaluated for all proteins of the four structural classes. the correlation coefficients between the non-polar components and the molecular weights were found to be higher than those obtained for the polar components in "mainly-alpha", "mainly-beta" and "alpha/beta" proteins, but not in "alpha+beta" proteins. in fact, in these structures the non-polar component was slightly higher than the polar one, as indicated by the mean ratios between non-polar accessibility values and the relative total accessibility .

moreover, as for the  <dig> Å layer around each protein, we verified that the number of water molecules increased linearly with the molecular weight of the proteins in all four sets . the correlation coefficients, calculated for proteins belonging to all four classes, between water-protein h-bonds and the relative total accessibility values were found to be consistently higher than those between water-protein h-bonds and the protein molecular weights . this suggests that both protein shape and surface extension may have a greater effect on the number of h-bond interactions between proteins and water than does protein size.

finally, the voids were analyzed in all proteins to assess both packing quality and individual voids  <cit> . the correlation coefficient between the largest void volumes and the total void volumes, calculated for all proteins belonging to each given class, was  <dig>  in "mainly-alpha",  <dig>  in "mainly-beta",  <dig>  in "alpha+beta" and  <dig>  in "alpha/beta" proteins, respectively. these values indicated that the total void volume of each structure belonging to "mainly-alpha", "mainly-beta" and "alpha+beta" classes represents mainly the largest void present, in agreement with results obtained analyzing a heterogeneous dataset  <cit> . the mean ratios between the total surface and buried void volumes and the total void volume  indicated that the selected structures had a greater number of voids on the surface and few buried voids, and that the total void volume consisted mainly of the surface void volume. the presence of few buried voids was used to verify that the selected proteins are well-packed and compact  <cit> . moreover, the total void volumes are < <dig> Å  <dig> in "mainly-alpha" and "mainly-beta" proteins, and > <dig> Å  <dig> in those "alpha/beta" and "alpha+beta", in which more buried voids are also present . these values could indicate that the "mainly-alpha" and "mainly-beta" proteins are more compact than the others.

as a final comment on the evaluation of these globularity features, we note that some differences were seen among the four structural classes, whose cause requires further investigation. different degrees of compactness as well as flexibility may be needed depending on the structural architecture which is often related to the functional role. as an example, the multi domain nature of alpha+beta proteins is often related to the need to open the protein globe and offer a larger cavity to fit a ligand. likewise, as in the case of barrel architecture, alpha/beta proteins show a large internal cavity which could explain the differences in void ratios for this class. however, other hypotheses could be postulated and this aspect of the results warrants further investigation.

our analyses have shown that some globular properties are well conserved in proteins within the same structural class. therefore, from these studies we obtained some theoretical parameters, i.e. linear regression equations and root mean squared error , shown in additional file  <dig>  specific for each structural class. these parameters could be useful in evaluating models, especially those predicted by "ab-initio" methods, for which reference structures are not available. a score value for all proteins was calculated by using the parameters having the highest correlation coefficients with the protein molecular weights  .

to test the applicability and usefulness of these criteria, thirteen targets of casp experiment were selected. only the full-atom structures were chosen for each testing set  <cit> . our results surprisingly show that many of the models submitted  should be discarded a priori because they do not have the structural properties expected in globular proteins.

an interesting aspect concerns the subdivision of prediction methods present in casp <dig> as "human" and "server" predictors  <cit> . the results shown in table  <dig> separate the two classes of predictors. the models exceeding the threshold value of our globularity score were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for human and server predictors, respectively.

the threshold value has been applied in our analysis as a cutoff which creates two subsets of models, the one below the cutoff should include models with globularity features in agreement with those expected in crystallographic structures, while the subset of models above the cutoff should include models with poor globularity features. to validate this, we evaluated the average model quality for the two subsets by using root-mean square deviations  and global distance test total score  reported in casp <dig> tables, as well as maxsub score  <cit> , by considering these parameters as correct model quality measures.

for each target and for the whole set, the average values of rmsd and gdt_ts were evaluated for the two subsets of models . the subset of the models below the cutoff resulted always  to have the best average quality, compared to the other subset.

moreover, we correlated our globularity score with a number of model evaluation parameters, i.e. gross violations of distance constraints , rmsd and gdt_ts reported in casp <dig> tables, as well as maxsub score. in addition, we applied to the models other quality assessment programs, i.e. prosaii z-score  <cit> , modcheck score  <cit> , anolea z-score  <cit> , and victor/frst function  <cit> , and compared these scores with our globularity score. the plots for each comparison are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  corresponding to each of thirteen targets analyzed and to the whole set. in particular, 79% of models with globularity scores lower than the threshold values have less than  <dig> distance violation . overall, the trend indicates that the threshold value of the globularity score selects the better models as evaluated by the different parameters. the linear correlation coefficients suggest that the globularity score is not directly related to prosaii z-score, modcheck score, anolea z-score, and victor/frst function. this suggests that our globularity score cannot simply be derived from other evaluation parameters, which means that our score can be used as an independent evaluation criterion.

the correlation coefficients between our globularity score, as well as all quality assessment programs listed above, and the correct quality measures  were evaluated for the whole set  and for thirteen targets . the globularity score has the better correlation with rmsd and gdt_ts.

in tables  <dig> and additional file  <dig> we have also reported the correlation coefficients between the four individual features  used in our work and the correct measures .

the combination of the four parameters in our score offer certainly some advantage. in fact, we have also evaluated the number of models in every dataset having the void number, mm-type h-bonds, water molecules and total accessibility in the ranges defined by the predicted values ± rmse . these results showed that the four structural properties are independent. the average gdt_ts measures for the models which pass the selection with the single features were also evaluated in order to know their quality . the average gdt_ts values for the whole set of selected models range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . by considering that the average gdt_ts for the subsets below and above the cutoff  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, we observe that the subset with the better quality is that selected by the globularity score. the exclusion of models by considering the simple range of each parameter, or the combination of two, three, or four parameters  may be too restrictive and in some cases would even disqualify the best theoretical models submitted for the targets. on the contrary, the use of the globularity score and the related value allows some models to pass the threshold even when some of four parameters do not fall within the range.

moreover, all the experimental structures, deposited in pdb, and the theoretical models indicated as the best submitted for these targets  <cit> , had score values below the thresholds . this confirms that our method provides reliable results. it should be noted that globularity is a spread property of proteins, but some proteins may have poor globularity features. therefore, we strongly suggest using our scoring method only for proteins expected to be globular. finally, our study suggests that the evaluation of theoretical models can be improved by taking into account the globularity features before releasing the models, submitting them to casp, or using them for further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed structural properties that characterize protein globularity and have suggested an operative procedure to be used for the analysis of globular quality of theoretical protein models, obtained by computational approaches in the absence of experimental target structures. our scoring method is a tool to avoid the diffusion of incorrect structures and of incorrect functional hypotheses, that can be employed to check the globularity of predicted models and to supplement other methods already used to evaluate their quality  <cit> .
