BACKGROUND
pseudogenes are defined as genes that have lost their ability to produce a functional protein. although such relics have been identified in all genomes, the number and persistence of pseudogenes varies greatly among species: in human, the estimated number of pseudogenes ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> , while in drosophila, only  <dig> pseudogenes  were identified  <cit> . pseudogenes are hypothesized to arise by gene duplication, including retrotransposition during which a retrotransposase mediates the integration a transcript into the genome  <cit>  . since they are redundant with the genes from which the transcript originated  and are integrated without a promoter into random locations in the genome, the products of retrotransposition events are likely to be nonfunctional and to accumulate disabling mutations faster than functional genes. in such cases, they are termed retrotransposed pseudogenes or processed pseudogenes. in general, acceleration of evolutionary rates have been measured immediately following duplication and used to explain functional diversification such as subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization and pseudogenization  <cit> .

limited effort has been put into whole-genome identification of pseudogenes in plants, and, although whole-genome, segmental and tandem duplications have played a large role in the evolution of plant genomes  <cit> , most of the literature has focused on the more readily identifiable retrotransposed pseudogenes. the arabidopsis information resource  has released the annotation of  <dig> pseudogenes in tair <dig>  which were presumably the result of a manual annotation effort  <cit> . studies in rice  and arabidopsis have focused on chimeric genes originating from the recruitment of additional exons by retrotransposed genes. as by-products of these analyses, wang et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> retrotransposed genes containing at least one frameshift mutation in rice, and zhang et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> in arabidopsis. a separate effort using more liberal criteria identified  <dig> retrotransposed genes in arabidopsis,  <dig> of which were disabled due to frameshifts or premature stop codons  <cit> .

the majority of studies on pseudogenes focus on the identification of gene relics in the intergenic regions and not among annotated protein coding genes. this is sufficient for highly curated genomes in which pseudogenes have already been annotated. however, an increasing number of genomes are annotated in an automated or semiautomated fashion, and rely partially on ab initio gene finders, which typically do not predict pseudogenes. the osa <dig> genome annotation  consists of gene predictions made by the ab initio gene finder fgenesh, and improved through incorporation of transcript evidence  <cit> . despite expression datasets in the form of expressed sequence tags , full-length cdnas and massively parallel signature sequencing tags , serial analysis of gene expression , and proteomic datasets, over 40% of the non-transposable element -related rice genes are not currently supported by transcript evidence. the ab initio gene-prediction software fgenesh was chosen for rice due to its combination of high sensitivity  and specificity  at the exon level  <cit> . despite this high performance, fgenesh is likely to circumvent premature stop codons or frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons in otherwise long open-reading frames  by adding introns or interrupting the orf prematurely. therefore, not only does fgenesh not predict pseudogenes, but it may predict an interrupted orf where a pseudogene is more likely. rice pseudogenes annotated by experts and deposited to the osa <dig> community annotation project are evidence of this issue. comparison of  <dig> pseudogenes annotated by community annotators in the osa <dig> release  <dig> gene annotation revealed that these pseudogenes had either been entirely "missed" by the osa <dig> automated pipeline , or had been misannotated , or had been annotated as genes   <cit> . these results suggest that a whole-genome approach to the identification of pseudogenes in the rice gene complement would improve the quality of the annotation.

pseudogene detection methods rely on the alignment of genes to intergenic regions for the identification of a pseudogene-parent pair. the characteristics of the pseudogenes are further determined based on global alignment of the pseudogenes to their respective parents  <cit> . the success of this type of approach is inherently dependent on the quality of the annotation for the organism in question, as it assumes that the structure of the parent gene is accurately predicted  <cit> . yao et al.  <cit>  used a different strategy: human genes and pseudogenes were identified by ranking the alignments of est, mrna, and protein based on identity and coverage. models created exclusively from non top-ranking alignments  were labeled as non-transcribed pseudogenes, while models with cognate transcript but frameshifted cognate protein were designated as transcribed pseudogenes. this approach produced a set of pseudogenes with  <dig> to 80% overlap with manually curated pseudogenes. an important advantage of this strategy is that it obviates the need for a pre-determined set of functional models. however, the authors also demonstrate that, in the case of the human genome , a minimum of  <dig> million ests is necessary to avoid over-predicting pseudogenes, a number vastly superior to what is currently available for rice.

we blended the two methods described above by using only fully-supported rice models to identify pseudogenes among a set of rice genes with features potentially indicative of pseudogenes, hereafter termed genes with pseudogene features  . pseudogene features assessed were i) lack of alignment to an est or cdna , ii) long untranslated regions , iii) short coding sequences , iv) a downstream poly-a tail, and v) for genes in segmentally-duplicated regions: differing protein length or number of exons between the duplicated genes, or lack of paralog and single-exon gene model structure. parent-derived models were constructed by aligning all fully-supported gene models  to the genomic sequence of gpfs. a total of  <dig>  pseudogenes, aligning over at least 70% of the parent and containing disablement  were identified in the rice gene complement. we characterized the pseudogenes, identified their most likely origin, investigated their ancestral function, and validated our method by comparing our results to previously identified pseudogenes in rice.

RESULTS
selection of a set of genes with pseudogene features  for further study
in order to avoid over predicting pseudogenes and thereby discarding the annotation of genuinely functional genes, the osa <dig> release  <dig> gene set was partitioned using criteria that differentiated high-confidence, well-supported genes from lower-confidence functional genes that may be pseudogenes and should be examined. the first criterion was transcript support, as evidence in other organisms suggest that the vast majority of pseudogenes are not transcribed  <cit> . reasons for the lack of expression of pseudogenes include the absence of a promoter in the case of retrotransposed pseudogenes and the accumulation of mutations within the promoter of a gene that has been made redundant by another type of duplication event. among the  <dig>  osa <dig> release  <dig> non-te-related genes, we identified  <dig>  genes without cognate est or cdna support  and  <dig> genes with long 5' or 3' utrs , which could indicate a truncated orf. we also identified  <dig> genes with long downstream stretches of adenines, which may be remnants of poly-a tails of transcripts integrated in the genome by a retrotransposase . an additional  <dig> genes, which were not part of the official osa <dig> release  <dig> because of the short length of their coding sequence  were also selected for further study .

 <dig> pseudogenes 

 <dig> gpfs not supported by cdna or est evidence

 <dig> the utrs of the gpfs are longer than mean +  <dig> standard deviations

 <dig> the cds of the gpfs are shorter than  <dig> amino acids

 <dig> the gpfs contain a stretch of  <dig> adenines in a 20-base window, within - <dig> to  <dig> bases from the end of the annotated utr, or within  <dig> bases of the stop codon if no utr is annotated

 <dig> the cds of the gpfs are significantly shorter than their respective paralog or, the gpfs have a significantly smaller number of exons

 <dig> the gpfs contain a single exon and are within a segmentally duplicated region but have no paralog in the duplicated region

to identify additional pseudogenes, we examined genes within segmentally duplicated regions  <cit> . among these,  <dig>  single-exon genes lacked a corresponding gene in the duplicated segment  and could be retrotransposed pseudogenes which inserted after the segmental duplication event. lastly, we searched for pairs of paralogous genes within duplicated segments  <cit>  that showed a disparity in gene length or exon number between their two members. a total of  <dig> gene pairs contained a shortened paralog based on cds length or exon number . in total,  <dig>  genes in osa <dig> release  <dig>  hereafter referred to as gpfs, had at least one feature associated with pseudogenes and were selected for further investigation.

identification of pseudogenes and parent genes
a total of  <dig>  gene models with ≥ 70% coverage of the protein encoded by the parent gene were identified using the strategy summarized in additional file  <dig>  among these,  <dig>  contained at least one disablement  and are hereafter termed pseudogenes . only one pseudogene had all disablements in the last  <dig> amino acid of its sequence .

pairwise alignments of the gpfs and the pseudogenes revealed that 75% overlapped, i.e., aligned over >  <dig> aa with 80% identity or with e-value < 1e- <dig>  indicating that most pseudogenes are variants of the fgenesh model from which the gpfs were derived. this also suggests that the pseudogenes identified in this study may have been recently acquired, and may have diverged less from functional genes than pseudogenes identified within intergenic regions where ab initio gene finders are unable to construct a model.

the vast majority of pseudogenes  originated from the largest group of candidates, the unsupported category. beyond the absolute numbers, the percentage of pseudogenes identified from the gpfs in each category varied from  <dig> % to 16% . significant differences in size within segmentally duplicated genes and unusually long utrs were the best indicators of pseudogenization, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the gpfs in these categories respectively identified as pseudogenes. a short cds and singleton status within a segmentally duplicated region were the least robust predictors for pseudogenization, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  pseudogenes, respectively. it should be noted that the percentage of pseudogenes identified in each category depends in part on the identification of a parent for the candidate pseudogene. any pseudogene that has diverged from its parent gene , or which has lost over 30% of its coding region, would not be identified within the parameters used in this study.

duplicated pseudogenes are more abundant than retrotransposed pseudogenes
number of exons within the pseudogene and corresponding parent gene was used to determine the pseudogenization mechanism. retrotransposed pseudogenes are expected to be single-exon genes regardless of the structure of the parent, while duplicated pseudogenes to have retained at least some of the ancestral introns based on the low rates of intron gain and loss observed in rice  <cit> . we were able to derive the pseudogenization mechanism for the  <dig>  pseudogenes with multi-exon parents . of these, 77% were multi-exon pseudogenes  while 23% were single-exon pseudogenes . among the remaining 43% pseudogenes  an overwhelming majority are single-exon pseudogenes with single-exon parents , and a small proportion consist of multi-exon pseudogenes predicted to originate from a single-exon parent . it is possible that the introns in this last group of pseudogenes are mis-predicted or appeared after the retrotransposition or duplication event, and originate from the insertion of a retroelement  <cit> .

*see table  <dig> for a description of the different categories

the pseudogenes were evenly distributed throughout the genome . examination of the distributions of retrotransposed and duplicated pseudogenes, segmentally duplicated regions and tandemly duplicated genes suggest that pseudogenes are not disproportionately associated with segmentally duplicated regions or clusters of tandemly replicated genes .

as expected, almost all of the pseudogenes identified in paralogous pairs within segmentally duplicated regions are of duplicated origin . among the pseudogenes of known origin, a significantly higher proportion of retrotransposed pseudogenes were identified in the single-exon singleton category , thereby verifying our hypothesis that many of these pseudogenes might have appeared by retrotransposition subsequent to the major segmental duplication event that occurred in rice  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

characteristics of the pseudogenes
comparison of the characteristics in duplicated versus retrotransposed pseudogenes  indicates that pseudogenes of duplicated origin are on average longer  and more similar to their respective parent genes as measured by nucleotide identity, protein similarity, and percent coverage. the number of disablements is slightly higher in duplicated compared to retrotransposed pseudogenes , but this trend is reversed when the number of disablements is normalized by the length of pseudogenes, as expressed in the number of disablements per  <dig> bases. these statistics suggest that retrotransposed pseudogenes have diverged more from their parent gene than duplicated pseudogenes.

the distribution of the number of disablements per pseudogene was plotted in figure  <dig>  retrotransposed, duplicated, and genes of unknown origin all followed the same relationship . the distinctive exponential relationship between the number of disablements and the number of pseudogenes suggests that the appearance of disablements in pseudogenes is random and may be corollary to reduced selective pressure on the pseudogenes  <cit> .

expression of the pseudogenes
several reports of a small but significant proportion of expressed pseudogenes in the human genome  <cit>  prompted us to look at the expression level of pseudogenes in rice. given the fact that 83% of the pseudogenes identified are in the unsupported category as defined by lack of est and full-length cdna support , we investigated deeper expression evidence datasets provided by mpss expression profiles. we searched for mpss tags identified in  <dig> rice libraries  <cit>  that mapped uniquely to pseudogene exons. overall,  <dig> pseudogenes  showed at least some basal expression in the mpss libraries surveyed, compared to  <dig> parent genes . however, the level of expression of these pseudogenes was significantly lower than that of their respective parent , which is consistent with the lack of est and/or full-length cdna support for the majority of the associated gpfs. the proportion of transcribed pseudogenes ranged from 0% in the short cds category to 35% in the duplicate category . altogether,  <dig>  of the transcribed pseudogenes were of known origin: among them,  <dig>  were of duplicated origin and  <dig>  were retrotransposed. based on the total number of duplicated and retrotransposed pseudogenes , these results indicate that 18% of the duplicated pseudogenes are transcribed versus only 10% of the retrotransposed pseudogenes. this difference is consistent with observations in human  <cit>  and is likely due to the fact that integration of mrna by a retrotransposase is random and does not necessarily occur proximal to a promoter.

rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution of pseudogenes
due to their non-functional nature, pseudogenes are not expected to be under evolutionary constraint and instead, are expected to be under neutral selection. thus, pseudogenes should have a synonymous substitution rate  roughly equal to the non-synonymous mutation rate , while functional genes should have a ka/ks much lower than  <dig>  since non-synonymous mutations present a disadvantage and are selected against . maximum likelihood estimates of the ka and ks were calculated by analysis of the alignments of the pseudogenes to their corresponding parents. we found that the ka/ks distribution was log-normal with a geometric mean of  <dig> . this is lower than the expected value of  <dig>  but can be explained in part by the fact that each pseudogene is compared to its "sibling" rather than its true, ancestral, parent. this approximation inflates the ks value and therefore decreases the ka/ks. furthermore, we estimated the ka/ks for paralogous functional genes within segmentally duplicated regions  <cit>  in the same manner as for the pseudogenes and compared the ka/ks distribution of the pseudogenes to that of this control set . the two distributions were found to be significantly different  .

evaluation of pseudogene detection method with manually curated pseudogenes
because they are defined by their non-functional nature, pseudogenes can not be verified experimentally. in the absence of a set of pseudogenes defined with certainty, we used a set of pseudogenes manually curated by the community to benchmark our pseudogene identification pipeline. as of december  <dig>  over  <dig>  rice genes have been annotated by experts and deposited within the osa <dig> community annotation project  <cit> . for some families , wall-associated kinases , cysteine-rich peptides, glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  hkt sodium and potassium transporters), annotation of pseudogenes as well as of functional genes was provided. these community annotated models were obtained by querying the six-frame translation of the rice genome with well-characterized proteins or sequence motifs and were subjected to manual curation  <cit> . a total of  <dig> annotated pseudogenes in these families overlap with osa <dig> release  <dig> gene models while other genes are predicted within intergenic regions of the genome. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> community-annotated pseudogenes were accurately predicted as pseudogenes in our pipeline. more importantly,  <dig> of the  <dig>  community-annotated pseudogenes were gpfs. this proportion is significantly higher than the proportion of osa <dig> release  <dig> gene models selected as gpfs . as seen in figure  <dig>  a blast alignment was obtained for the majority of the gpfs identified as pseudogenes by the community. however, many pseudogenes identified by the community annotators did not pass the strict coverage and disablement criteria set in our pipeline and as a consequence, were not annotated as pseudogenes in the present study.

ancestral function of the pseudogenes
the ancestral function of each pseudogene was determined based on the gene ontology slim terms associated with the pseudogene's corresponding parent, since the pseudogenes may have undergone sequence loss, and since, in the extant genome, the parent gene best represents the ancestral gene from which the pseudogene originated. a total of  <dig> parents corresponding to  <dig> pseudogenes were found to be associated with one or more go terms  <cit> . comparison of the relative frequency of each go term in the overall osa <dig> gene complement versus the pseudogenes revealed an over-representation of the genes involved in secondary metabolism, amino acid and derivative metabolic process, signal transduction, and kinase activity .

in order to refine this general categorization, the pseudogenization frequency was examined within paralogous families that were constructed through clustering of pfam and novel domains of the entire rice proteome  <cit> . a total of  <dig> parents of  <dig> pseudogenes belonging to  <dig> paralogous families were examined. the number of pseudogenes per family was plotted against the size of the family . the scatter of the data suggests that the number of pseudogenes per paralogous family is poorly correlated to the size of the family .

three families involved in ubiquitination contained a notable number of pseudogenes. family  <dig>  which contains  <dig> pseudogenes and  <dig> functional genes are characterized by a math ) and a btb/poz  domains. two families,  <dig> and  <dig>  containing f-box domains  have respectively  <dig> pseudogenes for  <dig> functional genes and  <dig> pseudogenes for  <dig> functional genes. both f-box and btb/poz proteins assure the function of substrate recognition during ubiquitination  <cit> .

most of the other families with a large proportion of pseudogenes are involved in secondary metabolism and have transferase activity, consistent with the over-representation of these two terms in our goslim analyses. family  <dig> containing the chalcone/stilbene synthase domain pf <dig>  the chalcone/stilbene synthase c-terminal domain pf <dig>  and the 3-oxoacyl  synthase iii c terminal domain pf <dig> comprises  <dig> functional genes and  <dig> pseudogenes. chalcone synthases catalyze the first committed step in the flavonoid pathway, which produces a wide range of secondary compounds. family  <dig>  is characterized by the dimerisation domain pf <dig> and the  <dig> parent genes of the  <dig> pseudogenes in this family are annotated as o-methyltransferases with homology to maize zrp <dig>  an enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway involved in the production of suberin  <cit> . family  <dig> comprises  <dig> pseudogenes and  <dig> genes characterized by the metal binding domain pf <dig> and the n-terminal domain pf <dig> of terpene synthases, a family of enzymes catalyzing the first step in many pathways leading to a wide range of secondary compounds and to gibberellic acid. family  <dig>  contains the cytochrome p <dig> domain pf <dig>  cytochrome p450s play an important role in hormone synthesis  and in secondary metabolism. these pseudogenes contributed largely to the enrichment of the go term go: <dig>  in our goslim analysis.

in addition, several families with no known domain or with domain of unknown function were found to be enriched in pseudogenes such as families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . most strikingly, the paralogous family  <dig>  which contains  <dig> functional genes, was found to have accumulated  <dig> pseudogenes, the largest number for any given family. these single-exon pseudogenes are children of  <dig> single-exon parents, with no identified pfam domains, and one uncharacterized domain identified by sequence homology.

discussion
number of pseudogenes in the rice gene complement
a total of  <dig>  pseudogenes were identified among the ~ <dig>  non-te-related genes annotated in osa <dig> release  <dig>  altogether, the presence of retrotransposed or duplicated pseudogene characteristics was investigated in a subset of the non-te-related genes . to our knowledge, our study is the first attempt at identifying and characterizing pseudogenes of duplicated origin in a plant species. while we identified  <dig>  pseudogenes in this study, these represent only a partial set of pseudogenes in the rice genome as we deliberately designed a conservative approach to annotating pseudogenes to prevent mis-annotation of true functional genes. first, we limited our analysis to a set of genes that are weakly supported by transcript evidence and/or exhibit features of pseudogenes, thereby limiting the number of functional genes examined. second, although disablements can be considered to be a consequence of the loss of functionality of a gene rather than a cause, and are therefore, by some definition, not a required feature of pseudogenes  <cit> , we required the presence of frameshift or a premature stop codon in our pseudogene set. it should be mentioned that only a minute number of pseudogenes are likely to be the product of a sequencing errors, which was estimated at  <dig> in  <dig>  bases in the finished rice genome sequence  <cit> . third, only fully-supported high-confidence models were used as potential parents for the pseudogenes to limit the propagation of errors from the parent to the pseudogene  <cit> . this implies that pseudogenes with poorly expressed parents may not be identified. fourth, identity and coverage thresholds used for the alignment of the parent to the candidate pseudogene regions were conservative, although within range of what had been used in similar analyses  <cit> .

retrotransposed versus duplicated pseudogenes
assignment of a probable mechanism of origination was possible for over half of the pseudogenes based on the internal structure of the parent gene and pseudogene. pseudogenes of duplicated origin are more abundant than pseudogenes of retrotransposed origin across all categories that were considered . moreover, comparison of duplicated and retrotransposed pseudogene alignments with their corresponding parent gene suggests that pseudogenes of unknown origin are likely to have arisen by duplication. this high ratio of duplicated versus retrotransposed pseudogenes differs from observations in human where retrotransposition is the source of 70–75% of the identified pseudogenes  <cit>  and in which the appearance of pseudogenes has been linked to a burst in l <dig> retrotransposon activity 40– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . however, the duplicated to retrotransposed pseudogene ratio is consistent with the important role of duplication in the shaping of the rice genome. by some estimates, over 50% of the genome could be the product of duplication  <cit> .

alignments of pseudogenes to their parents showed that retrotransposed pseudogenes are more diverged from their parent gene than their duplicated counterparts. this observation is consistent with the fact that products of retrotransposition, in the absence of a nearby promoter, are, in essence, pseudogenes as soon as they are inserted in the genome , and begin accumulating mutations faster than duplicated genes which remain functional for a period of time after duplication. therefore, the prevalence of pseudogenes of duplicated origin might be accentuated by the fact that a portion of retrotransposed pseudogenes are too degenerated to be identified by our method, and we can not discard the possibility that retrotransposed pseudogenes are more abundant in the intergenic regions.

pseudogenes are most abundant in fast-evolving gene families involved in ubiquitination and secondary metabolism
several large rice families, such as the btb/poz or the cytochrome p <dig> family are known to contain a large proportion of pseudogenes  <cit> . gingerich et al. <cit>  identified  <dig> functional genes and  <dig> pseudogenes encoding btb proteins in rice,  <dig> of which were also identified by our method. at least  <dig> pseudogenes for  <dig> functional cytochrome p450s were identified in rice  <cit> , and on a smaller scale itoh et al.  <cit>  identified a pseudogene in a cluster of rice ent-kaurene oxidase genes. although, to our knowledge, no terpene synthase or chalcone/stilbene synthase pseudogene has been reported in rice, a whole-genome survey of terpene synthases in arabidopsis identified a core of  <dig> closely related terpene synthases and  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> . there has also been reports of pseudogenes in the chalcone synthase family of ipomoea  <cit> , in the asteraceae genus dendranthema  <cit>  and in trifolium subterraneum  <cit> . the fact that results obtained through our automated pipeline are consistent with manual annotation is additional evidence of the genuine nature of the pseudogenes in our set.

despite the fact that superfamilies such as the cytochrome p <dig> or f-box proteins contain a high number of pseudogenes, the correlation between the number of pseudogenes per family and the size of the family was found to be low . this apparent contradiction can be explained by the high granularity of the set of paralogous families used here. proteins were separated into paralogous families based not only on pfam domains but also on uncharacterized domains identified through protein alignments  <cit> . the low correlation between number of pseudogenes and family size suggests that within a large family, the pseudogenes are often circumscribed to a subfamily of proteins. a notable exception is the pseudogenes associated with kinases. based on go term analysis, a kinase ancestral function can be attributed to  <dig> pseudogenes . however, these pseudogenes are distributed among a large number of paralogous families characterized with a kinase domain. as a consequence, none of these families was found to contain a noticeably large number of pseudogenes.

the families containing a large number of pseudogenes share functional and evolutionary characteristics. collectively, terpene synthases catalyze the first committed step to the several pathways producing primary compounds such as gibberellins, carrotenoids as well as pathways that produce a wide range of secondary compounds, many of them expressed in response to pathogen attack  <cit> . some members of the cytochrome p <dig> family are involved in the synthesis of gibberrellins, abscissic acid, brassinosteroids and many take part in the synthesis of phenylpropanoids   <cit> . chalcone/stilbene synthases are the gate-keepers of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, which lead to the synthesis of the anthocyanins responsible for flower color as well as a variety of compounds with a role in plant pathogen interactions  <cit> . the btb proteins are part of the btb e <dig> ligase complex and are responsible for the recognition of the targets to be ubiquitinated, a role similar to that of the f-box proteins in the scf  e <dig> ligase complex  <cit> . therefore, many families rich in pseudogenes participate in the synthesis of defense compounds or in the recognition of molecules destined for degradation.

in addition, these families contain phylogenetic clusters of lineage-specific genes. such indication of recent expansion has been shown for the btb/math branch of the btb proteins in rice, the branch that harbors the  <dig> btb pseudogenes that were identified in this study and gingerich et al.  <cit> . similar observations have been made for the f-box proteins in rice  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses have shown that terpene synthases are more similar within than across species, indicating that many functions have evolved repeatedly in different species. the same is true of the chalcone synthase family, which has been the subject of tandem duplication in multiple species  <cit> .

finally, enzymatic plasticity has been reported for the terpene synthases and the chalcone synthases. substitution of a few amino acids in the catalytic site of chalcone synthase turns the enzyme into a stilbene synthase  <cit> . in the terpene synthase family, a single amino acid difference observed in the catalytic sites of two orthologs of kaurene synthase in indica and japonica rice shifts the product outcome from ent-isokaur-15-ene, an intermediate in the synthesis of gibberellin to the secondary compound ent-pimara- <dig> -diene  <cit> . changes in vitro of a few amino acids in the catalytic site of a diterpene synthase from norway spruce radically changes the reaction outcome from a single product  to several   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig>  pseudogenes in the rice gene complement for which an orf is still detectable. a large number of these pseudogenes are members of fast-evolving families in plants and have a role in the response to biotic stresses and in ubiquitination. as plants adapt to a changing environment and evolution of pathogens, expanded subfamilies of genes involved in plant defense may act as sandboxes from which some genes emerge as advantageous and are subjected to positive selection while some are not and become pseudogenes.
