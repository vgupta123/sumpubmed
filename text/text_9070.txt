BACKGROUND
nuclear receptors  are a group of proteins defined by the presence of two functional domains: a highly conserved dna-binding domain  and a less conserved ligand-binding domain . they function as transcriptional regulators to control the expression of specific genes involved in development, homeostasis, and metabolism  <cit> . nuclear receptors are a large superfamily specific to metazoans, and seven subfamilies  are currently recognized based on structural and functional data  <cit> . the superfamily includes receptors for hydrophobic molecules such as steroid hormones, retinoic acids, thyroid hormones, and fatty acids  <cit> . two large subfamilies are nr <dig> and nr <dig>  the subfamily nr <dig> includes the thyroid hormone receptors , retinoic acid receptors , vitamin d receptors , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors . nr <dig> subfamily contains retinoid x receptors  and hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> . nr <dig> subfamily comprises receptors for sex and adrenal steroid hormones. while steroid hormone receptors  such as the androgen receptor , estrogen receptor , glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid , and progestagen receptor  belong to nr <dig>  the insect sr, ecdysone receptor  is in the nr <dig> clade  <cit> . some nrs are referred to as orphan nuclear receptors because their endogenous ligands remain unknown  <cit> . subfamily nr <dig> contains orphan receptors such as nerve growth factor-induced clone b , nuclear receptor related  <dig> , and insect hr <dig> . subfamily nr <dig> includes fushi tarazu-factor  <dig>  and hr <dig>  which are involved in ecdysone-regulated response pathways . nr <dig> contains insect hr <dig>  which is homologous to the vertebrate orphan receptor germ cell nuclear factor . the last subfamily, nr <dig>  includes two groups, a and b. nr0a group members lack a lbd and have been found only in insects, while members of nr0b, dax <dig> and shp, have been identified only in vertebrates  <cit> . because nuclear receptors are dispersed in genomes and functionally well characterized, they are considered a good model to study gene or genome duplication  <cit> . genome sequencing and comparative genomic studies have enabled identification of all nuclear receptor family members in some organisms. the number of nrs identified in sequenced genomes varies from species to species, as some nuclear receptors have undergone several gene duplication events during metazoan evolution  <cit>  while others have been lost due to gene loss. there are an estimated  <dig> nrs in drosophila melanogaster,  <dig> in daphnia pulex,  <dig> in tribolium castaneum,  <dig> in homo sapiens, and  <dig> in caenohabditis elegans
. an interesting feature of nuclear receptors in arthropods is that several nuclear receptors interact with the ecdysteroid hormone and are involved in ecdysone-mediated signaling, which regulates development, growth, and molting during embryogenesis  <cit> . molting and metamorphosis in arthropods are remarkable developmental processes trigger by ecdysteroid hormones and signal transduction by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. during the onset of metamorphosis, ecdysone regulates expression of several members of the nr superfamily  <cit> . nrs, therefore, are considered to be responsible for the evolution of insect metamorphosis by responding to ecdysone and juvenile hormone  <cit> . insect maturation is regulated by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone , which binds to a heterodimer of ecr and ultraspiracle   <cit> . in addition, many nuclear receptors such as dhr <dig>  dhr <dig>  dhr <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and ftz-f <dig> function as direct targets of 20e-ecr-usp . dhr <dig> functions as a second ecdysteroid receptor by dimerizing with usp or rxr, while dhr <dig> inhibits 20e-induced reporter gene transcription by binding to a subset of ecr-usp binding sites in cultured cells  <cit> . err directs a metabolic switch that supports developmental growth  <cit> .

the copepod tigriopus is a marine model species for ecotoxicology and environmental genomic studies  <cit> . copepoda is the second largest crustacean taxa and one of the dominant taxa in aquatic zooplankton communities, representing 70% of the ocean’s zooplankton biomass  <cit> . the nuclear receptor superfamily complement of some arthropods, including crustaceans, has been reported, but not that of any copepods. in this study, we identified the complete nuclear receptor repertoire of the copepod t. japonicus based on whole genome sequence and transcriptome data  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of nuclear receptors in t. japonicus
using whole genome sequences and rna-seq sequences of t. japonicus, we performed a blast analysis against the non-redundant  database of ncbi to obtain contigs containing the dbd and/or lbd domains of nuclear receptors. we found  <dig> contigs containing full or partial nuclear receptor dbd sequences. of these  <dig> contigs,  <dig> had both dbd and lbd sequences of nuclear receptors. full-length sequences of the putative nuclear receptors were obtained from partial sequences using race  methods. finally, full-length mrnas from  <dig> contigs were confirmed by rt-pcr analysis . further analysis of a conserved domain database allowed us to determine the dbd and lbd regions of each nuclear receptor  <cit>  and revealed that four receptors  had more than two isoform structures . tj-e75a and tj-e75c shared both the dbd and lbd, while tj-e75b shared only the lbd . in the case of tj-hr <dig>  two isoforms shared both the dbd and lbd . the two isoforms of tj-svp have an independent dbd and lbd in a consecutive tail to head structure . two tj-err isoforms shared both a dbd and lbd . nucleotide sequences of each isoform were confirmed by rt-pcr validation . we thus found a total of  <dig> nuclear receptors in the t. japonicus genome; the sequences of these receptors have been deposited in genbank .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis and nomenclature
phylogenetic analysis of nuclear receptors of t. japonicus and sequence comparisons with other organisms  were performed to classify the nuclear receptors found in t. japonicus and to investigate their evolutionary history with maximum likelihood method. the phylogenetic tree segregated the nuclear receptors of t. japonicus into five major clades  . seven subfamilies with  <dig> groups were evident . of the  <dig> nuclear receptors we identified,  <dig> receptors belonged to five groups  of subfamily nr <dig>  seven nrs to five groups  of subfamily nr <dig>  two nrs to two groups  of subfamily nr <dig>  and three nrs to group a of nr <dig> . subfamilies nr <dig>  nr <dig>  and nr <dig> contained one member in each subfamily. overall repertoire of nr subfamily groups in t. japonicus followed that seen in other arthropods, which is distinct from that in h. sapiens as an example of a chordate, although nr sets also vary between different vertebrate species  <cit>  . non-srs such as tr, rar, and ppar in nr <dig> and srs such as er and members in nr3c have not been detected in arthropods, as represented by d. melanogaster and d. pulex
 <cit> . similarly, the nr2e <dig> group in the nr2e subfamily is present in h. sapiens but not arthropods or crustaceans, whereas the opposite pattern has been observed for members of the nr2e <dig> and nr2e <dig> groups.figure  <dig>

nuclear receptor features unique to t. japonicus
of the  <dig> nuclear receptors in subfamily nr <dig>   <dig> members  were unique to t. japonicus . phylogenetic analysis placed the  <dig> nrs together as the sister group to a clade of nr1l receptors identified in d. pulex    . we assigned  <dig> nrs to hr97a1- <dig>  and hr97b1- <dig>  because the nr1l  group was recently characterized in daphnia species  <cit> , although the  <dig> members were formerly duplicated from d. melanogaster and d. pulex hr <dig>  with an independent lineage-specific expansion of three hr <dig> isoforms in d. pulex . the genetic distance of the t. japonicus nr1l members to the other nr <dig> groups was relatively high . moreover, distance values of nr1la  and nr1lb  in t. japonicus from other nr1l groups were higher than all daphnia nr1l members  . sequence similarity of the dbd and lbd of the  <dig> receptors and dhr <dig> ranged from  <dig> to 70% for the dbd and  <dig> to 37% for the lbd . the range of dbd sequence similarities among the  <dig> members in group nr1l was  <dig> to 78% .table  <dig>

this kind of gene expansion in nr1l has also been observed in other copepods;  <dig> nr1l members have been identified in tigriopus californicus  and eight nr1l members have been identified in the copepod paracyclopina nana . these nr1l members are considered unique to crustaceans, as the nr1l group has been identified in daphnia species and three copepods, but not in arthropods. as described above, t. japonicus had a similar set of nuclear receptors to those present in other arthropods . however, we were not able to detect e <dig>  in the genome of t. japonicus. hr <dig> in the e <dig> group of subfamily nr <dig> was also not detected in t. japonicus, as reported for d. pulex, suggesting a crustacean-specific gene loss of these two genes. to clarify whether this gene loss was copepod-specific or not, we attempted to find e <dig> and hr <dig> in the genomes of other copepods  but were not able to find any matches.

discussion
nrs are a diverse class of transcription factors that regulate hormonal and non-hormonal signalling processes in metazoans, and different numbers of nrs have been identified in different species . nuclear receptors have a conserved dbd and a moderately conserved lbd, which makes identification of nuclear receptors in the genome relatively easy and allows robust phylogenetic reconstruction at the superfamily level. using whole genome and transcriptome sequence databases, we identified a total of  <dig> nuclear receptors, including isoforms, in the genome of the copepod t. japonicus.

homologous nuclear receptors involved in developmental processes
nrs have been reported to be good phylogenetic markers, as they give robust results because of their structural conservation  <cit> . representatives of all seven subfamilies of nuclear receptors present in metazoans were identified in t. japonicus. of  <dig> nrs in t. japonicus,  <dig> members were homologous to those in other species, while  <dig> receptors were unique to t. japonicus . homologous nuclear receptors have been identified in d. melanogaster and d. pulex
 <cit> . developmental functions of nuclear receptors in arthropods have been well studied in drosophila
 <cit> . comparative functional studies of homologous nrs in other arthropods and expression studies of t. japonicus specific nuclear receptors might help clarify the involvement of nuclear receptors in development and ecdysone signaling in t. japonicus.

typical evolutionary patterns of nrs in crustaceans, arthropods, and chordates
arthropod nuclear receptor subfamilies show different evolutionary patterns from those of chordates  <cit> . nuclear receptor members in groups a, b, and c of subfamily nr <dig> are present in h. sapiens, but not in arthropods. the same is true for srs in the subfamilies nr3a and nr3c. there are two major sr lineages, namely the er lineage and the ar/pr/gr/mr lineage that descended from a single ancestral receptor by genome duplication  <cit> . despite the fact that srs play important physiological roles in vertebrates and a few invertebrates , homologues of these receptors have not been detected in arthropods. many non-steroid receptors such as rxr, ftz-f <dig>  coup-ft, and hnf <dig> appear to have been highly conserved through evolution, even though their developmental roles may be different in different metazoans  <cit> . however, it appears that ecdysozoa species do not have homologous members to nr3a in subfamily  <dig>  err from drosophila was identified as the gene most closely related to the vertebrate er gene in a non-chordate species  <cit> . errs share a common ancestor with ers based on phylogenetic analyses, and like tr and rar, are present in urbilateria  <cit> . srs such as er have well defined roles in mammalian reproduction. however, the er may originally play a role in the development and regulation of the nervous system, which controls species-specific behavior and endocrine homeostasis in birds  <cit> . no er has been found in arthropods .

expansion of nr1l members in crustaceans
although the subfamily composition of all nr members in t. japonicus is similar to that of other arthropods, there are more nr <dig> subfamily members in the copepod than in d. melanogaster and d. pulex. in t. japonicus,  <dig> of  <dig>  nuclear receptors are members of the nr <dig> subfamily. more than half  of all nuclear receptors in another crustacean, d. pulex, are nr <dig> members  <cit> . considering that 38% of nrs in d. melanogaster and 24% in t. castaneum are nr <dig> members  <cit> , crustaceans have more nr <dig> members than other arthropods. the unique nr1ls that we identified support expansion of the nr <dig> subfamily in crustaceans. daphnia has unique hr97/nr1ls in subfamily nr <dig>   <cit> . we also detected  <dig> unique nuclear receptors in t. japonicus, which all clustered in subfamily nr1l based on phylogenetic analysis. although we named these receptors ‘hr97/nr1l’ following the nomenclature for daphnia species, the genetic distance between t. japonicus nr1l members and daphnia nr1l subfamily members was high, implying that these receptors in daphnia may be an independent lineage. more sequence information from copepod nrs needs to be obtained to study copepod-specific nr1l gene expansion.figure  <dig>

previously, lineage-specific expansions of  <dig> members of nr1h and three members of nr2e were demonstrated in the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae
 <cit> . moreover, a massive duplication of hnf <dig>  occurred in c. elegans
 <cit> . also a lineage specific expansion in a lophotrochozoan has also been identified recently in the nr <dig> subfamily  of the pacific oyster  <cit> . nr complements can therefore be shaped by lineage-specific loss and/or tandem duplication events. in most crustaceans, nuclear receptors involved in ecdysone signaling are well studied, but the entire nr superfamily has only been studied in d. pulex and t. japonicus thus far. the expansion of nr1l members identified in t. japonicus and copepods  highlights the usefulness of studying copepods to gain a better understanding of comparative evolutionary diversification of nrs. data from more diverse crustaceans would further increase our understanding of this expansion.

copepod-specific nr evolution
although the overall pattern of nuclear receptor members present in t. japonicus is highly similar to that in other arthropods, we failed to detect a receptor homologous to e <dig> in t. japonicus, which was unexpected. in drosophila, e <dig> and e <dig>  orthologous of rev-erb, are derived from duplication events that did not occur in the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . unlike other duplicated pairs of genes such as hr <dig> and hr <dig>  hr <dig> and ftz-f <dig>  and dsf and tll, the pair e <dig> and e <dig> was detected in c. elegans, indicating that this duplication event occurred before nematodes branched off from the arthropod lineage  <cit> . in addition, the e75-e <dig> pair was also identified in crustaceans  <cit> . based on these observations, we expected that t. japonicus as a crustacean would have e <dig> and e <dig>  however, we were not able to find e <dig>  which suggests loss of this gene in this copepod lineage, because e <dig> is also absent from the genomes of t. californicus and p. nana. further phylogenetic studies of e <dig> and e <dig> in more crustaceans and copepods species as well as other related organisms are required to resolve this issue.

vertebrates do not have hr <dig> due to a gene loss event  <cit> . however, the hr <dig> gene has been identified in nematodes , an echinoderm , and a hemichordate   <cit> . in the red flour beetle t. castaneum, hr <dig> was the nr with the most divergent dbd and lbd domains, indicating decreased constraint on this gene in t. castaneum
 <cit> . particularly, the absence of an hr <dig> homologue in the genomes of d. pulex, t. japonicus, and other copepods  suggests that the hr <dig> gene was present in the urbilaterian ancestor to the arthropods but was subsequently selectively lost from the crustacean lineage. loss of nhr-239/hr <dig> appears to be unique to crustaceans among invertebrates.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report of all members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in a copepod species. t. japonicus has  <dig> nuclear receptors in the genome,  <dig> of which are copepod-unique receptors. the overall pattern of nuclear receptor members in t. japonicus was highly similar to that in other arthropods, although there appears to have been copepod-specific expansion of nr <dig> subfamily members. the absence of e <dig> and hr <dig> from t. japonicus and two other copepods suggests the possibility that this is a copepod-specific gene loss.
