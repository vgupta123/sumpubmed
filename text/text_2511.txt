BACKGROUND
trypanosomatids are flagellated protozoan parasites that belong to the order of kinetoplastida. three of them are human pathogens: trypanosoma brucei, responsible for the african human trypanosomiasis also known as sleeping sickness, trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of chagas’ disease in latin america, and leishmania sp., responsible for leishmaniases in many countries throughout the world. in addition to their importance in public health, the cell and molecular biology of these divergent eukaryotes is of great interest, and their study has revealed many original features. for example, the gene organization as large polycistronic-like clusters reminding that of prokaryotes is unique among eukaryotes  <cit> , and is thought to be related with the near-absence of rna polii promoters and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the 26 mb genome of t. brucei contains 9302– <dig> predicted genes  <cit> . according to genedb  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> cdss  are annotated as encoding ‘hypothetical proteins, conserved’ and ‘hypothetical proteins, unlikely’, respectively. several large studies using different approaches based on rna interference  have been reported with the aim of  giving clues on the function of the different cdss in this parasite,  finding regulators of the cell cycle progress,  opening new avenues for drug design  <cit> . two studies are of particular interest for the present study:  a case-by-case approach, in which almost all the cdss of chromosome  <dig> were individually targeted by rnai  <cit> ; and  a global approach with an 11× − coverage rnai plasmid library  <cit>  made of randomly sheared genomic dna and cloned in a vector for the tet-inducible expression of dsrna  <cit> .

among many singularities, trypanosomatids possess a single mitochondrion containing a complex mitochondrial dna organized in a dense network and termed kinetoplast. the kinetoplast is an essential organelle, not only because it contains a highly specialized form of mitochondrial dna but also because its duplication and segregation are tightly associated to correct cell cycle progress, in particular cytokinesis  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms governing this link between cytokinesis and the segregation of the kinetoplast and the basal body of the single flagellum are slowly being elucidated, but much remains to be done  <cit> . the t. brucei mitochondrial proteome has been extensively and rigorously analyzed  <cit> , which allowed the development of high quality multiparametric analyses in bio-informatics  <cit> . our starting hypothesis was that, by inhibiting the expression of mitochondrial proteins, we should be able to identify essential proteins associated with this part of the cell cycle in trypanosomatids, defined from cell cycle-specific phenotypes and/or growth reduction. here, we propose a methodical analysis of the effects of  <dig> rnai knockdowns targeting mitochondrial proteins, with the primary aim of determining their potential involvement into cell growth and cell division.

RESULTS
characteristics of the mitochondrial cds cohort
this study reports the results of  <dig> individual rnai knockdowns performed in procyclic forms  of t. brucei and targeting proteins for which the mitochondrial localization was predicted “with high confidence” in a previous study  <cit> , and for  which the annotation in the t. brucei genome database genedb  <cit>  was “hypothetical protein, conserved” at the start of the study. at the time of writing, new annotations have been proposed for a number of these cdss . all the targeted proteins belong to the mitochondrial protein inventory ‘mitocarta’  <cit> ). moreover, all  <dig> cdss but two  were also included in a global approach of “high-throughput phenotyping using parallel sequencing of rna interference targets”  developed after the start of our study  <cit> . finally, five of the analyzed cdss were included in a ‘semi-systematic’ rnai study focused on chromosome  <dig> of t. brucei but utilizing bloodstream forms   <cit> .

effect of rnai knockdowns on cell growth
we used the effect on cell growth at the procyclic stage as a first screen to categorize the results of the  <dig> rnai knockdowns. growth curves were constructed until day  <dig> post-induction. growth reductions of at least 50% and 25%, as compared with the uninduced cell line, during the first four days, were defined as severe and moderate effects, respectively. figure  <dig> shows three typical cell growth curves for null , moderate  and severe  growth reduction. these criteria, similar to those used in a previous study  <cit> , may appear arbitrary, in particular because the half-life of the targeted proteins is unknown; yet, they allowed us comparing our results with previously published data. in total, 10/ <dig> rnai experiments yielded a severe reduction of cell growth rates, 29/ <dig> a moderate reduction and 62/ <dig> no reduction. details of all raw data are presented in additional file  <dig>  representative northern blots of rnai experiments in each cell growth category are shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> effect on cell growth rates of rna interference-based knockdown of mitochondrial proteins in procyclic forms of trypanosoma brucei. four typical growth curves are shown: a: reference cell line ; b: no effect; c: moderate effect; d: severe effect. procyclic forms were grown in the presence of tetracycline to induce rnai , and cell growth was monitored daily for  <dig> days. growth curves for uninduced cell lines  are shown for comparison. insets: silencing was confirmed by northern blot, using the gene gpi <dig>  constitutively expressed in procyclic trypanosomes, as a loading control; at day <dig>  total rna was purified and northern blots were performed to assess levels of mrna. see definition criteria of the effects on cell growth in methods.



although subramaniam et al. used bsfs when they knocked down  <dig> cdss on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , they noted that “30% of the chromosome i genes generated a phenotype when targeted by rnai; most commonly, this affected cell growth, viability, and/or cell cycle progression”. therefore, the frequencies they observed were not greatly different from the ones reported here. yet, a detailed comparison of our results with theirs  <cit>  revealed one difference: one rnai knock-down, out of five examined here, showed a severe growth retardation in bsfs which was not found in our hands in pcfs . the four other ones were concordant in both studies, showing either no effect  or a growth defect in the remaining case .table  <dig>

we then compared our data with those obtained in pcfs using the global approach of rit-seq  <cit> :  <dig> out of our  <dig> cdss included in that study were considered not to be associated with growth defects, while 29/ <dig> lead to a growth reduction. these figures appear to be in the same order of magnitude as ours; but this apparent concordance hides significant differences which appear when comparing the results in details . indeed, the rit-seq study reported a cell growth reduction for 19/ <dig> rnai knockdowns which we classified as having no effect. conversely, no effect was noted in the rit-seq study for 22/ <dig> rnai knockdowns which we classified as having a moderate effect, and for 3/ <dig> which, in our hands, yielded a severe growth reduction. therefore, a high degree of discrepancy actually exists between both data sets, concerning 44/ <dig> compared proteins. one possible source of these discrepancies is that our pcfs were cultivated in vitro for a long time whereas in the rit-seq study, alsford et al. used induced pcfs directly deriving from bsfs. discrepancies were significantly lower when we compared our data to those obtained from individual rnai knockdowns in the literature  <cit> . indeed, this comparison showed a concordance between both datasets in 8/ <dig> cases ; whereas for three genes , conflicting results were obtained. as regard tb <dig> . <dig>  in spite of several attempts, colasante et al.  <cit>  could not obtain a viable null mutant by double knock-out, nor could they obtain it using rnai knockdown, even in non-induced condition. by generating cell mutants in which the inducible expression of a single c-myc-fused version of the gene was possible, they could evaluate the effect of the knockdown of this gene, and therefore inferred that it was essential for the parasite. by contrast, in our hands, mutant parasites for this gene were readily obtained ; and no growth reduction was observed after tetracycline induction, despite the efficient silencing of the gene .

detailed analysis of the major phenotypes associated to a moderate/severe cell growth defect
cell cycle phenotypes
we wished to determine if the cell growth phenotypes could be related with defects in the cell cycle progress. for this, since, in t. brucei, cell cycle phases can be recognized by the number and position of dna-containing organelles, a simple and often used method is the search for abnormal distributions of the numbers of nuclei  and kinetoplasts  in cells, such as cells containing >2 k and/or >2 n; this disturbs the ‘normal’ distribution pattern, defined by the proportions of 1n1k, 1n2k, and 2n2k cells in the population. for this, cells were stained with dapi at day  <dig> post-induction and a detailed examination was performed for all the mutants  for which a moderate or severe growth reduction was noted . surprisingly, all these rnai knockdown experiments but two , i.e. 37%  of the cdss examined in total, yielded abnormal patterns as compared to that of the reference cell line. this is in striking contrast with the data obtained in bsfs by subramaniam et al.  <cit>  when they knocked down all the cdss of chromosome 1: there, only 6% of the genes were associated to both a growth and a cell cycle defect. the data for these  <dig> experiments are summarized in figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig> figure  <dig> schematic representation of the different cell cycle phenotypes observed in  <dig> rnai mutant cell lines showing a reduction in cell growth. the bars represent the proportions of 1n1k , 1n2k , 2n2k  and “abnormal ‘n/k’ phenotypes” , the latter corresponding to phenotypes absent or rare in the reference strain . more details about these abnormal phenotypes are given in the additional table and figure . abscissa : mutant rnai cell lines code names ; ordinate: proportions of the normal n/k phenotypes in %; the cell lines were arbitrarily ordered from left to right according to their proportions of “abnormal ‘n/k’ phenotypes”.



the percentage of 1n1k cells was increased in only two mutant cell lines , and similar to the reference cell line in three mutants , but lowered in the  <dig> others. in the mutant line t <dig> , the reduction in 1n1k cells was particularly drastic, by a  <dig> -fold factor as compared with the reference line  ; in this line, we also observed a severe reduction of parasite growth and a large excess of multinucleated cells  and multikinetoplastic cells , together with zoids  and akinetoplastic cells , indicating a complete cytokinesis block in spite of continuing nucleus duplication. 2n1k cells, a rare phenotype in the reference cell line , were found in increased proportions in 77% of the rnai mutants  . one of the correlations that might be done is the concomitant increase of zoids  and of 2n1k cells that may originate from an abnormal division of normal 2n2k cells. indeed, in the majority of mutants, the increase of both 0n1k and 2n1k were of the same order of magnitude . however, in eight cases , the proportions of 2n1k cells were increased without a corresponding increase in zoids, rather suggesting a kinetoplast replication block.

morphological phenotypes
cell growth reduction was often associated with significant cell morphological changes. these morphological phenotypes were most often multinucleated cells  which were significantly increased in  <dig> cell lines. these cells could have one or two or, more frequently, several kinetoplasts, indicating a cytokinesis block, sometimes leading to a complete disorganization of the cell morphology . cytokinesis defects  could also be associated with other cell cycle phenotypes, such as abnormally segregating kinetoplasts , and/or mis-positioning of segregated kinetoplasts between the two divided nuclei . to date, only a single protein, alba <dig>  an rna-binding protein, has been involved in the migration of the nucleus towards the posterior end of the cell in t. brucei during cell division  <cit> . the kinetoplast was found anterior to the nucleus in a very high proportion of cells  in two cell lines, t <dig> , and t <dig> : this aberrant positioning  of the kinetoplast was reported after the mix-rnai in a previous study  <cit> . by contrast, the involvement of a putative ribosomal protein in this process is surprising: as mentioned by the authors, this might be explained by the fact that the complexes purified by zikova et al.  <cit>  are part of a larger supercomplex with additional functions.figure  <dig> pleiotropic morphological changes associated with growth defects following rnai knockdown in t. brucei.

in 25/ <dig> cell lines, abnormally segregating kinetoplasts  were seen, most often in proportions varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. even when they were in higher proportions, they could not be associated to any specific ‘cell cycle pattern’. the t <dig> mutant, which was described here above with a gross cytokinesis block, exhibited as much as  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cells with enlarged and abnormally segregating kinetoplasts, respectively. the whole of these results strongly suggest a blockage of kinetoplast segregation. the corresponding predicted protein was annotated as a the beta subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase  in genedb, but actually characterized by acestor et al. as a component of the respiratome, encoding subunits of the cytochrome bc <dig> complex  <cit> . this suggests a largely indirect effect, i.e. that the rnai target is not actually a direct effector of kinetoplast segregation.

another interesting phenotype affecting the kinetoplast was that of t <dig>  encoding the bona fide alpha subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase  <cit> . t <dig> displayed a relatively ‘common’ disruption of the ‘n/k’ pattern but an exceptionally high  proportion of 0 k cells. a closer examination showed that 74% of the cells had a kinetoplast greatly reduced in size. the rnai of several proteins closely associated with the kdna has been previously shown to cause kdna loss  <cit> . yet, what appears here as a defect of the kinetoplast maintenance is again likely one indirect effect secondary to the mis-processing of one mitochondrial imported protein among many. such an indirect role may be illustrated by a protein named tblok <dig> for loss of kdna: the authors found that the disappearance of the kdna occurred well after cell division ceased, arguing that the requirement of tblok <dig> for kdna maintenance is indirect  <cit> .

cytokinesis was also specifically impaired in two mutant lines , where long dividing  cells were seen still joined at their posterior end in significantly high numbers ; it is noteworthy that, to our knowledge, only one protein, spastin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, has been shown to be functionally involved in this final step of cytokinesis in t. brucei, and specifically in bloodstream forms  <cit> .

a number of abnormal morphological phenotypes could not be specifically related to the cell cycle . one of these was the presence, in five mutant lines, of particularly long cells , sometimes twice as long as the non-induced cells , in proportions as high as ~26% in lines t <dig> and t <dig>  ~20% in two other mutants  and ~8% in one . in mutant t <dig>  these elongated cells were multinucleated ; but in general these phenotypes could not be correlated with any specific ‘n/k’ phenotype: this suggests that, although a tight association between morphogenesis and the cell cycle in t. brucei is well documented  <cit> , the proteins knocked down here are not necessarily involved in a particular step of the cell cycle.

finally, in t <dig>  the high increase of 2n1k and zoids was associated to the presence of numerous fragmented  nuclei  in 16% of the cells , as well as a distinctive phenotype consisting in half  of the cells being ‘globular’ with pyknotic nuclei , suggesting a profound disruption of unknown essential functions. the abnormal cell division observed here may then well be an indirect consequence of this more global disorder. morphologically apoptotic nuclei  <cit>  were seen at a high frequency in only four other lines  but without the ‘globular’ phenotype. however, flow cytometry analysis of the five corresponding cell lines confirmed apoptosis in only two out of five of these .

CONCLUSIONS
among the  <dig> mitochondrial protein genes knocked down here by rnai,  <dig> could be related to a growth defect of the parasite. this number may seem low, but is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . several hypotheses may explain the apparent absence of effect seen in the  <dig> remaining rnai knockdowns:  there may be a functional complementation by another protein,  they may play a role in another differentiation stage of the parasite,  they may simply be non-essential, at least in the experimental conditions used here.

it came as a surprise to us that almost all  <dig> proteins for which the expression inhibition yielded a growth reduction appeared to be somehow involved in the cell cycle progress. clearly, the proportion of such proteins is much higher among mitochondrial proteins  than among ‘unsorted’ chromosome  <dig> proteins   <cit> . moreover, there are numerous mitochondrial genes on chromosomes 9– <dig> of which the knock-down may also induce cell cycle perturbation, but these were not included in this study. however, we believe that a proportion of these proteins is pleiotropic and only indirectly involved in the cell cycle progress: the correct progression of this part of the cell cycle may directly or indirectly depend upon a variety of cell activities, e.g. metabolism, signaling cascades, chaperones, etc. the large variety of morphological changes observed here in the mutants indeed suggests that the disruption of the cell cycle might take place upstream, without the corresponding proteins being directly related to it. also, although the gene targets were analyzed using trypanofan, we cannot rule out the possibility that off-target effects occurred, particularly for those genes which can be classified as ‘pleiotropic’.

in total, the ‘semi-systematic’ study presented here opens avenues for the characterization of novel proteins involved in the correct cell cycle progress in t. brucei. our data also show how post-genomics analyses performed on a case-by-case basis may yield discrepancies with global approaches. finally, they add to the complexity of the picture of cell biology, particularly the cell cycle, of t. brucei, characterized by a tight interdependency of multiple biological processes.
