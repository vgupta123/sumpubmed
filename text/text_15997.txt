BACKGROUND
malaria, a disease caused by plasmodium species, is one of the oldest and largest health challenges affecting 40% of the world population  <cit> . there were an estimated  <dig>   <dig> malaria deaths in  <dig>  including 91% in africa, mainly caused by p. falciparum infection, the most lethal malarial plasmodia responsible for the cerebral form of the disease. approximately 86% malaria deaths are children under  <dig> years of age  <cit> . these estimates rank malaria as one of the top three killers among infectious diseases in the world. although plasmodium falciparum prevalence rates in most parts of china and myanmar have been brought under control, very high transmission rates still remain in certain regional communities  <cit> . due to the economic boom in china, cross border transmission has resulted in increasing malaria incidence in recent years. current economic globalization trends coupled with marked movement of people have accelerated the incidence of plasmodium related cases with increased antimalarial drug resistance in southeast asia, including china  <cit> . the yunnan province alone counts over ten million cases of malaria among border and immigration officers, an indication of the prevalence of malaria at both sides of the border. continuous migration of the population in border areas makes it extremely difficult to implement malaria control programs. available data in recent years have also shown imported cases of malaria in henan, hebei, fujian, chongqing, shanghai, jiangxi and among others  <cit> .

inaccurate and ineffective diagnosis of p. falciparum in these regions has resulted in drug resistant species, pointing to the need for improved diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. the total eradication of malaria is one of the urgent aims of the united nations millennium development goals. the methods recommended by who for p. falciparum diagnosis include microscopic examination, immunological tests, and pcr methods  <cit> .

since the launch of who’s t <dig> initiative in  <dig>  all malaria-endemic and donor countries should ensure that every suspected case of malaria is tested and treated,  <cit>  requiring increased developent of rapid diagnostic tests . hence the use of fast, accurate, and easy on-site detection methods and reagents as monitoring medical tools for early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in regions of high transmission and prevalence is particularly important. several detection antibodies against different plasmodium antigens have been described, of which plasmodium falciparum specific histidine-rich protein  <dig> , and plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase  and aldolase are common to all four plasmodium species  <cit> . the pfhrp  <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig> of the parasite and comprised of both exons i and ii, encoding a 309-amino acid protein. sequence variations among the different strains range between  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs. the pfhrp exon ii alone encodes  <dig> amino acids composed of  <dig> % histidine and  <dig> repeats of the tripeptide his-his-ala sequences. hrp  <dig> is released upon rupture of parasitized erythrocytes at late-stage  <cit>  and is capable of reversing the tightly balanced activities of anticoagulant factors that maintain homeostasis  <cit> .

the most convenient technique for clinical diagnosis of malaria is the use of rapid diagnostic test kits, which depends on the use of mabs against the hrp  <dig> antigen. these tests are particularly important since they can be used in field diagnostics  to screen large populations without the requirement of trained laboratory personnel or equipment. several tests targeting hrp  <dig> are available, with various specificities, sensitivities, and temperature tolerances, illustrating the difficulties and challenges facing current rdts  <cit> . the difficulties associated with rdts include genetic variability in the hrp  <dig> gene and the persistence of antigens in the bloodstream following the elimination of parasites  <cit> . for instance, parasight f, a sensitive, specific, simple, and fast dipstick assay, uses mab igg <dig>  a subclass of igg  <cit> . however, hrp 2-based rdts have given false-positive results and there has been some debate as to the cause of these false positives  <cit> . therefore, the development and production of mabs with high affinity, specificity and sensitivity will help facilitate its use as poct.

in this study, we aimed to express the hrp  <dig> exon ii antigen retaining the essential epitopes that can serve as immunogens for use in developing mabs against hrp  <dig> for poct immunochromatographic assay, according to guiding principles formulated by the who  <cit> . the results of assays were compared with those of microscopic examination known as gold standard for clinically screening of malaria samples in endemic regions of china and myanmar.

methods
sample collection and reference samples
clinical samples  were collected between  <dig> and  <dig> from patients  with fever and suspectable for malaria from henan  and yunnan  provinces of china  and from myanmar  region , where malaria is endemic and is caused mainly by plasmodium falciparum as shown in figure  <dig>  the study was approved by the ethics committee of yunnan institute of parasitic diseases. all participants or legal guardians signed informed consent before participant enrolment and sample collection. complete anonymity was maintained at each stage of the study. the research has been also approved by the national engineering laboratory of point-of-care testing .figure  <dig> geographical distribution of malaria endemic areas in china and myanmar.  <dig>  henan province ;  <dig>  yunnan province ;  <dig>  myanmar .



the diagnosis of malaria follows diagnostic criteria for malaria issued by the ministry of health of the people's republic of china. patients were included if they ①came from relatively serious malaria epidemic area and ②suffered from fever of unknown origin. patients were excluded if they ①suffered from vivax malaria or ②had mixed infections. the samples were confirmed as single malignant malaria infection by microscopic examination of thick blood smear.

an expert medical technologist collected approximately 5 ml of blood from adult subjects and 3 ml from minor subjects by venipuncture. thick and thin blood films were prepared in duplicate using two drops of blood for each sample. the remaining blood was preserved at −20°c in edta tube. thick blood films were stained with 10% giemsa and microscopic examined by experienced technicians.

expression and purification of hrp  <dig> protein
plasmodium falciparum genomic dna was extracted from clinical blood samples provided by prof. hui liu , using qiaamp dna mini kit . pair of oligonucleotide primers was designed, complementary to forward and reverse strands of the hrp  <dig> exon ii based on the sequence obtained from genbank . the forward primer was hrp 2-f: 5׳-tatacatatgaataattccgcatttaataataact-3׳, and the reverse primer hrp 2-r: 5׳-tacagtcgacatagacgtacttcttttcgtaag-3׳. the forward and reverse primers were designed to contain ndei and xhoi restriction sites, respectively. restriction endonucleases , dna markers and pcr mix were purchased from dongsheng biotech company , while the t <dig> dna ligation mix was obtained from takara biotech co. ltd . the hrp  <dig> gene was cloned into a pet30a vector and transformed into cacl <dig> competent e. coli bl <dig>  cells  <cit> . pet-30a plasmid and bl <dig>  cells were provided by prof. jufang wang of south china university of technology. starter culture was grown overnight at 37°c in 5 ml lb medium, supplemented with kanamycin . this stationary phase culture was used to inoculate 1 l lb medium to an od <dig> of  <dig> . the latter culture was inducted with 1 mm iptg for target protein expression at 30°c and 225 g, overnight. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 3 min and cell pellets resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 100 mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> . cell suspensions were ultrasonicated on ice and centrifuged at 4°c at 12000 g for 15 min. the resulting supernatants were purified on a hi-trap ni2+ column  using akta purifier and the purified recombinant hrp  <dig> protein  fractions visualized on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis   <cit> . the protein samples  were purified by dialyzing against 50 mm carbonate buffer, ph  <dig> .

animal immunization and mab production, screening, purification and characterization
six-to-eight-weeks-old balb/c mice were purchased from the animal laboratory center of sun yat-sen university . all experimental procedures were in compliance with the guide for care and use of laboratory animals . all animals were allowed free access to food and water.

mabs were produced as described by kohler and milstein  <cit>  and screened by indirect elisa described below. the igg fractions were prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation and purified on protein a column. the titers were determined by indirect elisa and mab isotyping was carried out using mouse mab isotyping kit purchased from sigma-aldrich  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the specificity of monoclonal antibodies was determined by their binding affinity to both rhrp  <dig> and p. falciparum infected blood samples. sds-page was carried out on 12% separating and 5% stacking gels, followed by protein transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes. supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate  was applied for visualization. determination of antibody affinity was carried out by a noncompetitive elisa as described by david beatty  <cit>  with little modifications.

indirect elisa
microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg/ml of purified rhrp  <dig> in coating buffer . after overnight incubation at 4°c, plates were rinsed with washing solution  and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumen  for 2 h. 100 μl hybridoma cell supernatants were added to wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°c. after washing, 100 μl goat anti-mouse igg-hrp  antibodies were dispensed into each well followed by 1 h incubation at 37°c. the enzymatic reaction was visualized using tmb substrate with hydrogen peroxide and stopped with 2 m sulphuric acid. optical density  was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. samples were considered positive with od of cell supernatant  to negative control  ratios greater than  <dig> .

sandwich elisa
purified mabs were paired, labeled with periodate oxidation and sandwich elisa was performed as described before  <cit> . the lower the od, the two strains of antibody antigen epitope closer; the higher the od value, illustrate both the antigen epitope is more far.

establishment of poct lateral immunochromatographic assay
hrp  <dig> specific mab 1a <dig>  and goat-anti-mouse igg  were diluted in  <dig>  m carbonate buffer and sprayed on a nitrocellulose membrane at  <dig>  and 1 μl/cm <dig> to form test and control lines, respectively. the prepared nitrocellulose membranes were kept in a dry pack at 30°c and 30% humidity. 1c <dig> antibody were conjugated to colloidal gold as described by oliver  <cit>  and sprayed on glass fiber at 12 μl/cm <dig>  the strip was assembled by placing  <dig>  cm of antibody-gold conjugate glass fiber a few centimeters from the test line and 4 mm wide test strips were cut. test strip preparation was done in a good manufacturing practice  workshop.

sample evaluation and sensitivity calculation
positive control samples provided by who were evaluated alongside  <dig> clinical samples and test results were compared with microscopic examinations. about 5 μl of each sample was applied to the sample site and three drops of dilution buffer added. test strips were observed for 15 min and results were interpreted as positive when both the control and test lines turned red and negative if only the control line turned red. in cases where the control line did not appear, the results were considered invalid and the assay repeated.

sensitivity of the test equals the ratio of total positives to total number of samples, specificity equals the ratio of total negatives to total number of samples, positive predictive value equals the proportion of the number of positive cases detected among actual positives cases and negative predictive value equals the proportion of the number of negative cases detected in relation to actual negatives.

statistics
statistical analysis was performed with spss  <dig>  software . data obtained from both microscopic examination and immunochromatographic test were analyzed. sensitivity and specificity of the assay and how it compares with the standard microscopic examination was analyzed. agreements between both data were computed by kappa statistics. differences were considered statistically significant at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
malaria diagnosis
microscopic inspection showed that most samples were positive for only plasmodium falciparum infections, with no mixed infections detected  including 60/ <dig>  samples from henan, china, 105/ <dig>  samples from yunnan, china and 157/ <dig>  from myanmar. negative plasmodium falciparum blood samplesn=194) were also assessed by thick and thin smear microscopic examinations and confirmed to be plasmodium falciparum negative, including 30/ <dig>  samples from henan, china, 97/ <dig>  samples from yunnan, china and 67/ <dig>  from myanmar.

discussion
malaria is a major public health problem worldwide and its total eradication is one of the urgent aims of the united nations millennium development goals. hence the use of fast, accurate, and easy on-site detection methods and reagents as monitoring medical tools for early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in regions of high transmission and prevalence is particularly important. however, the performance of existing hrp  <dig> tests in areas of intense malaria transmission varies by age and prevalence of p. falciparum infection  <cit> . the particularly low specificity among children results in over-estimation of malaria infection prevalence in this group  <cit> .

in the current study, we aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of hrp  <dig> exon ii for use in developing mabs against hrp  <dig> for poct. we have successfully expressed recombinant hrp  <dig> exon ii in e. coli and purified its full amino acid sequence. after administration of the purified rhrp  <dig> antigen in mice followed by fusion of mouse splenocytes with myeloma cells, two different hybridomas  producing anti-hrp  <dig> mabs were selected and used for the preparation of ascitic fluids in mice. after purification of ascitic fluids by ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein a column, specificity of 1a <dig> and 1c <dig> was assessed by immunoblot: both antibodies exhibited remarkable specificity for detection of both recombinant and native p. falciparum hrp  <dig> antigen, binding to no other protein in human blood serum.

a noncompetitive elisa method was used in the determination of antibody affinity. we found association constant  values of  <dig>  x 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  for 1a <dig> and 1c <dig>  respectively, an indication of the high binding affinity of these two mabs. the high affinity observed for the expressed exon ii region of pfhrp  <dig> suggests that epitopes are conserved in this region. therefore, the recombinant pfhrp  <dig> protein developed in this study can serve as immunogen to facilitate the production of high affinity and high specificity mabs for use in clinical diagnosis of malaria caused by p. falciparum. the genetic diversity of hrp  <dig> affects the performance of the hrp 2-based rdt  <cit> .

microscopic examination of both thick and thin blood smears is a traditional detection method and hence considered the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. however, due to its complicated operation and the requirement of experienced laboratory technicians, field application is limited. poct, a new concept for rapid diagnosis of clinical samples developed in recent years is very crucial. poct is based on small, portable, easy to operate, fast, accurate, and effective devices for on-site monitoring of infections. sensitivity of hrp detection kits is affected by several factors including the quality of mabs used, immunogenic response of b cells to the different epitopes of hrp  <dig> protein  <cit> , and the polymorphism observed in the hrp gene sequence. the hrp antigen contains numerous repeats of histidine and alanine amino acids. the tripeptide repeat ala-his-his in hrp  <dig> is quite conserved, while ala-ala-asp which also has only slight variations can be detected by mabs specific to hrp  <dig> in different isolates  <cit> .

the lateral immunochromatographic assay was developed with the two hrp  <dig> specific mabs and used for testing of blood samples collected from high endemic regions in china and myanmar. there was a strong agreement between the immunochromatographic test results and microscopic examination among the  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative samples tested . the observed sensitivity and specificity were  <dig>  and 100%, respectively . in clinical samples, there were false negatives at low parasite densities. however, samples with parasite densities above  <dig> parasites/μl were detected with 100% sensitivity .

mabs with acceptable sensitivity, specificity and high affinity for the pfhrp  <dig> antigen are prerequisite for accurate diagnosis of p. falciparum infections. because of the limited supply of mabs, it is very likely that most hrp 2-based rdts use similar or identical antibodies. existing hrp 2-based rdts are known to yield false-positive results  <cit> . therefore, development of new mabs with high sensitivity for use in hrp  <dig> diagnostic test kits is very important. we have evaluated two such mabs and experiments are underway to further define the specific epitopes recognized by these mabs and develop serological test kits using these mabs. the newly designed rdts combining two different mabs would improve the detection of malaria worldwide given that the epitopes involved are common to all p. falciparum, resulting in saved lives and reduced occurrence of parasite resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
the plasmodium falciparum hrp  <dig> exon ii contains immunogenic sites similar to those on the native antigen. these immunogenic sites can effectively be utilised for the development of highly sensitive and specific mabs to facilitate malaria diagnosis in endemic communities.
