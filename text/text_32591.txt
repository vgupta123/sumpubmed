BACKGROUND
huntington's disease  is a severe, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that typically has its onset in mid-life, though it may occur in the juvenile years or in the elderly, and that produces an inexorable decline to death 10– <dig> years later  <cit> . its cardinal clinical feature is a characteristic motor disturbance involving progressive choreoathetosis, but the disorder also involves psychological changes and cognitive decline. the neuropathological hallmark of hd is the loss of medium spiny striatal projection neurons in a dorso-ventral/medio-lateral gradient that eventually decimates the caudate nucleus, but considerable neuronal loss also occurs in other parts of the basal ganglia and in the cortex  <cit> . the pathogenic process of hd is initially triggered by an expanded polyglutamine segment near the amino terminus of huntingtin, an ~ <dig> kda protein whose precise physiological function is uncertain  <cit> . huntingtin is required for normal embryonic development and neurogenesis, based on the lethal consequences of mutational inactivation in the mouse  <cit> . by contrast, the hd mutation itself does not impair this developmental activity but rather produces a "gain-of-function" that acts to cause the disorder  <cit> . genotype-phenotype studies of hd patients, in comparison with other polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders, have delineated a number of genetic criteria for the mechanism that triggers hd pathogenesis: 1) a threshold polyglutamine length ; 2) progressive severity with increasing polyglutamine length above the threshold; 3) complete dominance over the wild-type protein; 4) greater dependence on polyglutamine length than on huntingtin concentration  and 5) striatal selectivity, due to the huntingtin protein context in which the polyglutamine tract is presented  <cit> .

the "gain-of-function" due to the hd mutation is thought to lie in a novel conformational property conferred on mutant huntingtin by the expanded polyglutamine tract  <cit> . this has been supported by in vitro studies of a small amino-terminal huntingtin fragment, where an expanded polyglutamine tract promotes self-aggregation in a manner that conforms to the first four genetic criteria  <cit> . the in vitro aggregation involves a conformational change of the polyglutamine segment from a random coil to an amyloid structure and is paralleled in cell culture in some ways by the formation of cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions that also incorporate other proteins  <cit> . neuronal inclusions containing amino-terminal fragment have also been detected in hd brain, though their role in pathogenesis remains a matter of debate, as they may occur late in the pathogenic process as a consequence of huntingtin degradation  <cit> .

precise genetic modeling of hd in the mouse supports the view that in vivo, the "gain-of-function" property conferred by the expanded polyglutamine acts within full-length huntingtin to cause abnormalities that do not initially involve formation of an insoluble aggregate  <cit> . knock-in mice in which the hd mutation has been introduced into hdh, the mouse orthologue, display early biochemical and histological phenotypes that are associated with expression of full-length mutant huntingtin at normal physiological levels and in a normal developmental pattern  <cit> . indeed, the phenotypes associated with expression of full-length mutant huntingtin in these mice, and in neuronal progenitor cells derived from them, also fulfill the genetic criteria for the mechanism triggering hd pathogenesis  <cit>  one of the earliest phenotypes is the nuclear localization of full-length mutant huntingtin in the nucleus of striatal neurons  <cit> . together, the knock-in mouse data suggest that the process of pathogenesis is triggered by the presence of expanded polyglutamine in full-length huntingtin and leads only after many months to the formation of amino-terminal huntingtin fragment and inclusion formation  <cit> .

we have postulated that the same conformational property that promotes aggregation in the context of a small fragment may also act with the context of full-length huntingtin to trigger pathogenesis, possibly by altering huntingtin's interaction with another cellular element. consequently, we have identified small molecules from the ninds custom collection of bioactive compounds that inhibit in vitro aggregation of amino-terminal mutant huntingtin  <cit> . these have been tested for their ability to reverse the huntingtin localization phenotype associated with full-length mutant huntingtin in cultured striatal progenitor cells from hdh knock-in mice. our findings indicate that some of these compounds reverse the effects of the expanded polyglutamine in both assays and support the view that some inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation may lead to viable therapeutics targeted at full-length mutant huntingtin, early in the disease process.

RESULTS
screening for inhibitors of aggregation
we have previously demonstrated that, when released from the protection of a gst fusion protein, the amino terminal fragment 1– <dig> of mutant huntingtin, forms aggregates in a manner consistent with the genetic criteria for the mechanism of hd pathogenesis  <cit> . we used a modified version of this assay, implemented using a 96-well format elifa dot blot apparatus, to screen the ninds custom collection  which consists of  <dig> small bioactive compounds, both fda-approved drugs and natural products . the screening was carried out in a blinded fashion as part of the ninds neurodegeneration drug screening consortium, with the identities of compounds in the ncc only being made available after completion of the screens  <cit> .

in our primary screen , gst-q58-htn  was mixed with thrombin  and immediately dispensed into a 96-well pcr plate containing compounds diluted to a final concentration of  <dig> μm. incubation was continued for  <dig> hours at room temperature to allow aggregate formation. the aggregation was stopped by 2% sds/ <dig> mm 2-mercaptoethanol followed by boiling for  <dig> minutes. the mixture was filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane by using a 96-well elifa dot blot apparatus. the aggregates retained on the membrane were detected and quantified by immunoblotting and subsequent image analysis. a typical immunoblot result is shown in figure 1b. congo red, a known huntingtin aggregation inhibitor, was used as the positive control  <cit> .  <dig> μm congo red can completely inhibit the q58-htn aggregation. dmso, used for the negative control, had no impact on q58-htn aggregation.

potential inhibitors were distributed evenly cross the whole ncc library . sixty compounds that showed more than 50% inhibitory effect were selected to be retested in a second screen at a lower concentration of  <dig> μm. the  <dig> compounds in column  <dig> of plate  <dig>  were missed in the primary screening at  <dig> μm, and were therefore also tested in the second screening at  <dig> μm. in the primary screening, a "hit" could have resulted either from direct inhibition of polyglutamine-induced aggregation or indirectly, by inhibition of the thrombin and consequent failure to cleave gst-q58-htn, which does not by itself aggregate. consequently, the second screening at  <dig> μm was carried out after thrombin digestion, to eliminate thrombin inhibitors. western blotting showed that more than 95% of gst-q58-htn is cleaved by thrombin  within  <dig> minutes . consequently, the mixture of gst-q58-htn and thrombin was preincubated for  <dig> minutes, followed by centrifugation to remove any aggregates already formed, before adding the test compounds. nineteen of the compounds tested at  <dig> μm, showed significant direct inhibitory effects on aggregation. the  <dig> most potent compounds, corresponding to a 'hit' rate of 1%, are shown in figure  <dig> 

characteristics of aggregation inhibitors
to determine the potency of each inhibitor, we performed dose response assays at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm. representative curves for the  <dig> most potent compounds are shown in figure  <dig>  gambogic acid and celastrol showed strong but incomplete inhibition even at the maximum concentration, permitting approximately 20% residual aggregate to form. the average ic <dig>  values for the most potent  <dig> compounds, which range from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm, were obtained from at least two independent experiments each . the most effective aggregation inhibitor was gossypol-acetic acid complex, followed closely by gambogic acid, and then juglone, celastrol, and sanguinarine nitrate, which all had ic <dig> values less than  <dig> μm.

effect on striatal cells expressing endogenous full-length mutant huntingtin
to test the hypothesis that compounds, which inhibit the aggregation-promoting property of amino-terminal mutant huntingtin will also rescue effects of full-length mutant huntingtin, we tested the top six inhibitors in a striatal cell-based assay. mutant hdhq111/q <dig> and wild-type hdhq7/q <dig> striatal cell lines, st7/ <dig> and st111/ <dig>  respectively, which have been prepared by transformation with a tssv <dig> vector, can be propagated in culture and used for cytological and biochemical comparisons  <cit> . these cells express full-length mutant or wild-type huntingtin, respectively, with no evidence of truncated amino-terminal fragments, no formation of polyglutamine aggregates and no cell death-producing toxicity. however, like the striatal neurons of hdhq111/q <dig> knock-in mice, the st111/ <dig> cells show nuclear staining of huntingtin when tested with an amino-terminal huntingtin antibody that is sensitive to the conformation of the full-length protein . by contrast, st7/ <dig> cells expressing wild type huntingtin show both nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining with the same huntingtin antibody . this differential localization phenotype occurs early in the cascade of events detected during the lifespan of hdh knock-in mice, months before the appearance of huntingtin amino-terminal fragment, and fulfills the genetic criteria from genotype-phenotype studies in hd patients, including polyglutamine length progressiveness and striatal specificity, suggesting that it follows from the same property that triggers hd pathogenesis.

this huntingtin localization phenotype was used to monitor the effect of inhibitors in the mutant cells , and the results are shown in table  <dig>  about 89% of st7/ <dig> striatal cells showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining signal, while st111/ <dig> striatal cells showed only nuclear signal . of the six compounds tested, celastrol and juglone both reversed the mutant phenotype in a dose-dependent manner. juglone showed no evident cell toxicity up to  <dig> μm, where 68% of mutant cells had reverted to wild-type phenotype. celastrol reverted up to 81% of the cells but showed toxicity, killing ~4% of cells at  <dig> μm. gossypol acetic acid complex was less effective, but showed no toxicity. at  <dig> μm, only 15% of the mutant cells displayed the wild-type phenotype. gambogic acid showed a comparable small effect at  <dig> μm but was very toxic at high concentration, as all cells were killed at  <dig> μm. sanguinarine nitrate and anthralin showed little effect on the huntingtin localization phenotype in this assay.

discussion
a dramatic marker of pathology in many neurodegenerative disorders is the appearance of intracellular inclusions in some surviving neurons  <cit> . in hd, these inclusions stain positively for huntingtin, ubiquitin and a number of other proteins, but are thought to be initiated by the aggregation of an amino-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin, due to its expanded polyglutamine tract  <cit> . a number of model systems have been developed to investigate the polyglutamine-driven aggregation process and its consequences both in vitro and in vivo, but it remains unclear in hd whether the formation of aggregates plays an essential role in the pathway of pathogenesis or is a downstream by-product of neuronal dysfunction induced by full-length mutant huntingtin  <cit> . in either event, the search for drugs that alter in vitro aggregation of amino-terminal huntingtin fragment is attractive, since the aggregation-promoting physical property exhibits characteristics comparable to the disease-producing property of corresponding human alleles, as defined from genotype-phenotype studies of hd patients. for example, if accumulation of huntingtin inclusions is the proximate cause of neuronal death, compounds that inhibit aggregation would have therapeutic potential. conversely, if the inclusions are only a downstream marker of the pathogenic process, the same drugs may still have therapeutic potential if they act on the property of full-length mutant huntingtin that triggers pathogenesis. it was with a view to testing whether the in vitro aggregation assay could act as a proxy for monitoring the disease-producing property of mutant huntingtin that we undertook this study.

a comparable screening assay to the one used here has been employed to screen a large chemical library and has demonstrated the feasibility of identifying small molecule inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation, including a family of benzothiazole-related compounds  <cit> . however, the long, arduous and expensive process of developing compounds for use as drugs in humans prompted us to screen a smaller chemical library biased toward drugs already approved by the u.s. food and drug administration. the aggregation-inhibiting compounds that we identified came from a collection of mostly fda-approved compounds and bioactive natural products that were specifically assembled for a neurodegenerative disease drug screening consortium supported by the national institute for neurological disorders and stroke and several disease foundations, including the huntington's disease society of america  <cit> . the drugs were distributed to  <dig> different labs for blinded testing in assays of potential relevance to neurodegenerative disease.

unfortunately, despite the preponderance of fda approved drugs in the collection, none of our top hits  is a compound approved for internal use in humans. the most effective inhibitor of aggregation was gossypol-acetic acid complex. gossypol, a polyphenol found in cottonseed, has been studied extensively as a male contraceptive in china but the world health organization has argued against its use because of induced hypokalemia, high toxicity and the risk of permanent sterility  <cit> . almost as potent, gambogic acid is a complex ring-structured natural product that is the main active ingredient of gamboge resin from the garcinia hanburyi tree. it has long been used as a pigment for painting and in traditional medicine as a potent purgative. recently, it was identified in a high-throughput screen as an apoptosis inducer with potential for development as an anti-cancer agent  <cit> . juglone is a napthoquinone found in the bark of the black walnut , which has been used as an herbal medicine for its antihaemorrhagic and antifungal properties  <cit> . celastrol is a triterpenoid from the vine tripterygium wilfordii used as an alternative medicine for rheumatoid arthritis that has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic activities. it has been proposed as worthy of exploration as a therapeutic in alzheimer disease  <cit> . sanguinarine, a benzophenanthridine alkaloid from bloodroot  has broad antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory, as well as potential anti-angiogenic activity  <cit> . it has been used as an oral rinse and as a potential antigingivitis/antiplaque agent in toothpaste  <cit> . anthralin is a synthetic derivative of chrysarobin, a traditional remedy for various skin ailments from andira araroba, that has been widely used as topical treatment for psoriasis and alopecia areata  <cit> .

although none of these bioactive compounds is a candidate for immediate human trials, they provided a means to test whether compounds that inhibit polyglutamine aggregation might also block the neuronal phenotype caused by an elongated polyglutamine tract in full-length huntingtin. while we do not have a direct physical measure of huntingtin conformation and it remains possible that compounds could reverse the cellular phenotype by different pathways, our finding that juglone and celastrol, two drugs of different structure selected as hits in our primary aggregation assay, are both effective at restoring cytoplasmic huntingtin staining in the striatal cell assay suggests that they both act via a conformational property of mutant huntingtin. that gossypol, gambogic acid, sanguinarine and anthralin were not effective could be due to any of a number of reasons, including cellular uptake, toxicity, interaction with other cellular components, etc. however, it may also indicate that these compounds do not directly modify the conformational property of mutant huntingtin, but instead block a different step in the in vitro aggregation process or that they do so by a different physical effect than juglone and celastrol. a detailed analysis of structure-activity relationships using structurally-related compounds and testing in vivo in knock-in mice for their ability to reverse the cascade of mutant huntingtin-associated phenotypes will be needed to adequately assess the potential of any of these different types of compounds for testing in hd clinical trials.

the remaining compounds identified as weaker aggregation blockers in our primary screen include selamectin, a veterinary anti-parasitic  <cit> , pararosaniline pamoate, a treatment for schistosomiasis  <cit> , tyrothricin, a cyclic peptide antibiotic, and meclocycline, a tetracycline-related antibiotic. the latter is of particular interest since it was the most potent of several tetracycline-related antibiotics present among the ncc compounds, including tetracycline, chlortetracycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, methacycline, oxytetracycline and notably, minocycline, which has been proposed as a therapeutic in hd and other neurodegenerative disorders. minocycline is an fda approved antibiotic used for a variety of infections that has variably been reported to improve symptoms in the r6/ <dig> exon  <dig> overexpression hd model  <cit> . it has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity that has been proposed to involve several potential mechanisms of action. in our hands, minocycline is a weak inhibitor of polyglutamine aggregation with an ic <dig> of  <dig> μm . this is consistent with the inhibitory effect on huntingtin exon  <dig> aggregation reported previously at  <dig> μm in long-term hippocampal slice cultures from the r6/ <dig> mouse  <cit> . two safety and tolerability studies of minocycline in human hd are completed  <cit>  and can be expected to lead to efficacy trials earlier than any trials for strong aggregation inhibitors. however, it is conceivable that long-term, low level inhibition of mutant huntingtin's aggregation-promoting conformational property, independent of minocycline's anti-apoptotic activity, may be sufficient to alter detectably the timing of disease onset or early progression. if the hoped for positive results are obtained in minocycline hd trials, this alternative mechanism should be considered since it would have implications for testing of meclocycline and for assessing the potential trade-off between potency and toxicity in choosing other aggregation inhibitors as potential long-term therapeutics.

interestingly, the same set of  <dig> ncc compounds were screened for their ability to block toxicity in a pc <dig> cellular assay where induced expression of huntingtin exon  <dig> encoding  <dig> glutamines leads to the accumulation of aggregates and rapid cell death  <cit> . although eighteen compounds were found to be completely protective, none was among our hits, suggesting that the mechanism of polyglutamine toxicity in the pc <dig> cells is fundamentally different than the mechanism involved in the in vitro aggregation assay. among a secondary class of partially protective compounds in the pc <dig> assay, only celastrol overlapped with our hits. the ncc compounds were also screened in a cellular assay in hek 293t cells expressing androgen receptor with  <dig> glutamines  <cit> . in this model for spinal bulbar and muscular atrophy, accumulation of intracellular inclusions, accompanied by caspase  <dig> activation, is followed by cell death within  <dig> hours. twenty compounds that blocked caspase  <dig> activation included celastrol, gambogic acid, sanguinarine and tyrothricin, though all but sanguinarine showed toxicity. the major finding from this assay was that several cardiac glycosides were protective, presumably by a different mechanism than our hits. indeed, although most of the assays in the ninds consortium involved disorders associated with protein aggregation, including various polyglutamine disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinson disease, there was a remarkable lack of overlap in hits suggesting that the individual assays targeted fundamentally different mechanisms. a possible exception was celastrol, which was found as a hit in our aggregation assay, the two assays noted above, and other assays which will be discussed in a summary article describing the consortium.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification and further characterization of chemical inhibitors of in vitro aggregation of an amino-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin offer promise for the development of potentially therapeutic compounds that also target the deleterious conformational property of full-length mutant huntingtin.
