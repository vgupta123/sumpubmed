BACKGROUND
ribulose- <dig> -bisphospate carboxylase/oxigenase  is the cornerstone of photosynthesis responsible for the conversion of inorganic carbon into organic compounds. "the most abundant protein in the world", rubisco, comprises up to 50% of all soluble proteins in plants  <cit> , which is the price phototrophs have to pay for the enzyme's relatively slow and inefficient performance. rubisco confuses the substrate of photosynthesis, co <dig>  with the product, o <dig>  resulting in energy-wasting photorespiration. as the performance of this enzyme may greatly affect crop yields, significant efforts have been made to study the structure and the function of rubisco, with the aim to artificially improve its performance  <cit> . significant natural variation among the kinetic parameters of rubiscos from different species  <cit>  and its dependence mainly on environmental pressure  indicate possible positive selection to optimize co2/o <dig> specificity and maximize the rate of catalytic turnover of rubisco in different thermal and gaseous conditions  <cit> .

rubisco is one of the slowest and largest enzymes, with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda  <cit> . in land plants and green algae, the chloroplast rbcl gene encodes the 55-kda large subunit, whereas a family of rbcs nuclear genes encodes nearly identical 15-kda small subunits  <cit> ; in nongreen algae both the rbcl and rbcs genes are chloroplast encoded  <cit> . the form i rubisco of plants and algae is a hexadecameric protein composed of eight large and eight small subunits, while the form ii rubisco of some prokaryotes and dinoflagellates consists of a large subunit dimer  <cit> . because large subunits of form ii enzymes contain all the structural elements required for catalysis, the origin and the role of small subunits in form i enzymes remain enigmatic  <cit> .

being one of the most conservative genes, rbcl is often chosen by botanists for phylogenetic reconstructions and it has been sequenced in thousands of plant species  <cit> . surprisingly, despite rubisco's great physiological importance, well studied protein structure and abundance of sequence data "the systematists have generally treated rbcl sequences as strings of anonymous nucleotides, without function"  <cit> . while degeneration or loss of rbcl in parasitic non-photosynthetic flowering plants has attracted much attention  <cit> , little is known about rbcl evolution in other groups. the highly conservative nature of rbcl is probably the reason for the lack of enthusiasm for the evolutionary analysis of this gene, and in particular for the study of putative positive selection acting on rbcl. the only exception to this trend was the analysis of the rbcl evolution in the thermotolerant cyanobacteria genus synechococcus, which has shown an increase in the number of hydrophobic residues in the rbcls of more thermotolerant strains – a pattern observed for many thermostable proteins  <cit> . however, the dataset of eight sequences used in synechococcus study could be too small to detect positive selection using likelihood molecular phylogenetic analysis  <cit> .

previously we have reported positive selection in the rbcl gene associated with an adaptive radiation in the hawaiian endemic genus schiedea of the caryophyllaceae family  <cit> . interestingly, the schiedea study demonstrated that adaptive substitutions in rbcl could have caused the spread of an advantageous haplotype across several closely related species, causing incongruence between the chloroplast and species phylogenies  <cit> . however, positive selection in rbcl of schiedea could have been driven by adaptation to contrasting environments  and it remains unclear how common is positive selection in rbcl of other phototrophs. this motivated us to conduct a wider study of positive selection in the rbcl gene. here we report the phylogeny-based and protein structure-based analyses of positive selection in  <dig> rbcl sequences representing all the main lineages of green plants and some of other phototrophs, such as brown and red algae, diatoms and euglenids, as well as cyanobacteria. we found that while there is no clear evidence for positive selection in cyanobacteria and algae, positive darwinian selection in rbcl is fairly common in all the main lineages of land plants . using the computational analyses of the tertiary structure of rubisco we show that positively selected residues are mainly located in regions important for dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small subunit and rubisco-rubisco activase interactions.

RESULTS
positive selection in rubiscos of land plants, but not of algae and cyanobacteria
in order to test for the presence of positive selection acting on rubisco we used  <dig> rbcl sequences from different phototrophs . most rbcl sequences analyzed  belong to flowering plants and represent  <dig> orders and  <dig> families  providing reasonable coverage of the most taxon-rich lineage of phototrophs. the coverage outside flowering plants was less extensive . for computational efficiency all the sequences were divided into  <dig> monophyletic groups, based on their phylogenetic relations .

for the detection of positive selection we used nested maximum likelihood models allowing for variation in the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions rates  across codons implemented in paml  <cit> . for each dataset we performed one likelihood ratio test  for dn/ds heterogeneity across codons , which was significant for all  <dig> analyzed groups, indicating expected heterogeneity in selective pressure across the rbcl molecule . further, we performed two lrts for the presence of codons under positive selection: m7-m <dig>  <cit>  and m8a-m <dig> comparisons  <cit> . the m <dig> model assumes a discrete beta distribution for dn/ds, which is constrained between  <dig> and  <dig>  implemented using ten classes taken in equal proportions. to test for the presence of codons with dn/ds >  <dig>  m <dig> is compared to the m <dig> model, which is similar to the m <dig> model, but allows for an extra "eleventh" class with dn/ds ≥  <dig>  <cit> . this test was significant for  <dig> out of  <dig> analyzed groups . a more stringent test for positive selection compares model m <dig> with m8a, which is similar to the model m <dig>  but allows for an extra class of codons with dn/ds =  <dig>  <cit> . this test was significant for  <dig> out of  <dig> analyzed groups . in  <dig> cases  both m7-m <dig> and m8a-m <dig> comparisons rejected models without positive selection in favor of m <dig> model assuming positive selection .

i number of groups with detected positive selection in rbcl among investigated plant lineages. p <  <dig> 

j proportion of groups with detected positive selection in rbcl among investigated plant lineages. p <  <dig> 

for all analyzed lineages of land plants  positive selection was found in most cases . the smallest proportion of cases with detected positive selection and average dn/ds value of "eleventh" class in m <dig> model were in mosses ; the highest – in gymnosperms . there was no significant difference between the lineages of land plants in proportion of groups with positive selection . among the main lineages of flowering plants – magnoliids, monocots, commelinids, eudicots , rosids  and asterids  – the smallest proportion of cases with detected positive selection was in monocots ; the highest – in asterids  . there was no significant difference between the lineages of flowering plants in proportion of groups with positive selection .

while positive selection is widespread in land plants we did not find it in algae  and cyanobacteria . positive selection has been detected in a combined rbcl dataset of  <dig> sequences of land plants and algae . the fact that positive selection was detected in a large combined data set may simply mean that the signal of positive selection is very strong in land plants so m. anisimova and v. savolainen still detect the signal when averaged across lineages with no positive selection, such as algae.

as increasing number of sequences should increase the sensitivity of the analysis  <cit> , we joined the sets of green  and brown algae . again there was no evidence for positive selection in the joint algae dataset in either m7-m <dig> or m8a-m <dig> comparisons. although in our dataset land plants were much better represented , compared to algae  and cyanobacteria , the difference in proportion of groups with positive selection was significantly larger in land plants than in algae and cyanobacteria combined . in fact, the difference in proportion of groups with positive selection between land plants and algae is conservative, given the sequence divergence is higher in algae and cyanobacteria datasets, compared to land plants . the power of lrts increases with sequence divergence until it reaches its maximal value, after which further increases of sequence divergence lead to reduced power  <cit> . the tree length values  for algae and cyanobacteria datasets ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were in the optimal range for detection of positive selection  <cit> . the tree length values for the most of the land plant datasets were smaller than optimal , hence the number of cases with detected positive selection in land plants may be underestimated.

could the difference in the presence of positive selection between land plants and algae be due to structural differences of their rubiscos? there are prominent differences in the rubisco protein structures within the paraphyletic algae group with no positive selection detected , while the rubisco structures of land plants with widespread positive selection and green algae with no selection detected are virtually identical  <cit> . so, structural differences can not explain the contrast between algae that do not show evidence for positive selection in rbcl, and land plants, where positive selection in this gene is ubiquitous.

an aquatic habitat is one of the few parameters shared by most algae and cyanobacteria, but not by most of land plants, thus the presence of positive selection in rubiscos of land plants, but not in algae and cyanobacteria may be due to ecological differences between aquatic and terrestral habitats. thermal and water regimes are more stable in aquatic, compared to terrestrial environments. furthermore, algae have a "bicarbonate pump" – the co2-concentrating mechanism that uses bicarbonate dissolved in water and suppresses the oxygenating activity of rubisco, making gaseous conditions of rubisco performance more stable  <cit> . interestingly, aquatic land plants, a small group of angiosperms with a submerged aquatic lifestyle as a derived state, also use the bicarbonate pump  <cit>  and hence may be expected to have weaker signal of positive selection than their terrestrial relatives. indeed the sets that consisted exclusively of submerged aquatic angiosperms  or contained a high proportion of them  did not show any evidence for positive selection in rbcl . however, when aquatic land plants from sets monocots- <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed together  both m7-m <dig> and m8a-m <dig> comparisons confirm a presence of positive selection, suggesting that its signal in aquatic land plants is too weak to be detected in the analyses of smaller groups . thus, it seems likely that aquatic conditions require less fine-tuning of rubisco activity by positive selection, compared to terrestrial habitats.

our analysis of  <dig> rbcl sequences revealed the presence of positive selection in 78% of analyzed land plant groups, but not in algae and cyanobacteria. the finding of widespread positive selection in rubisco suggests that either selection still continues to improve performance of this ancient critically important enzyme, or that adaptive evolution in rbcl may reflect the fine-tuning of rubisco to optimize its performance in various gaseous and thermal conditions  <cit> . the much weaker evidence for positive selection in algae and aquatic land plants growing in more stable conditions, compared to terrestrial land plants, suggests that the later explanation is more probable. this is also consistent with the finding that natural variation among the kinetic parameters of rubisco enzymes from different species depends mainly on environmental pressures rather than on the phylogeny  <cit> .

a few rubisco residues are responsible for the most cases of positive selection
to identify amino acid sites potentially under selection in the groups with positive selection, the parameter estimates from m <dig> model were used to calculate the posterior probabilities that a codon belongs to a class with dn/ds >  <dig> using the bayes empirical bayes approaches implemented in paml  <cit> . in  <dig> groups with positive selection detected by both m7-m <dig> and m8a-m <dig> comparisons,  <dig> out of  <dig> rubisco residues  had a bayesian posterior probability of positive selection larger than  <dig>  in one or more cases when analyzed by the bayes empirical bayes  <cit> . in  <dig> groups  more than one residue was under selection . the distribution of residues identified in our analyses as evolving under positive selection was highly uneven: twenty of the most often selected residues are responsible for more than 70% of the cases of positive selection . analyses of rubisco tertiary structure revealed that some of the twenty most often selected residues are quite close to each other and most of them are involved in interactions between rubisco large and small subunits, in interactions with rubisco activase, dimer-dimer and intradimer interactions, as well as in interactions with the active site . the analyses of mutant rubisco enzymes have shown that interface between large and small subunits contributes to holoenzyme thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and co2/o <dig> specificity  <cit> . rubisco activase is responsible for facilitating the opening of the closed rubisco form to release ribulose- <dig> -bisphospate and to produce the active form of the enzyme  <cit> . loop  <dig> plays a major role in discriminating between co <dig> and o <dig> and functions as a flexible "flap" that closes over the active site once the substrates are bound, and the carboxyl terminus folds over loop  <dig> and appears to stabilize its closed conformation  <cit> . more specifically, the effects of amino acid replacements in three residues  out of twenty most selected in our analyses were tested by directed mutagenesis in the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii: aspartate  <dig> to arginine substitution had little effect  <cit> ; valine  <dig> to leucine substitution improved the termal stability of wild-type rubisco in vitro  <cit> ; cystein  <dig> to serine substitution showed an increased resistance to inactivation when rubisco in the oxidized state  <cit> . the general congruence between our findings and ones obtained by mutagenic approach suggests that amino acids evolving under positive selection in rbcl are located in regions important for rubisco activity and residues involved in dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small subunit and rubisco-rubisco activase interactions as well as ones close to the active site are apparently the prime targets of positive selection in rubisco. the rubisco regions characterized by high density of residues evolving under positive selection and located relatively far away from the active site  could be good candidates for mutagenic studies to reveal the broader picture of how rubisco functions. detection of positive selection at the interfaces between chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded rubisco subunits and between rubisco and rubisco activase suggests that co-evolution of proteins in the rubisco complex can be another driving force of adaptive evolution in rbcl.

directed mutagenesis of rubisco residues in chlamydomonas showed that a single amino acid substitution, apart from the active site, has little effect on rubisco function even if it occurs in a functionally important region, but when double or triple substitutions were created, significant changes were observed in both enzyme catalytic efficiency and specificity  <cit> . in our study, in 95% of groups with detected positive selection, several residues  simultaneously were shown to evolve under positive selection  suggesting their coevolution within rubisco. simultaneous coevolution of multiple residues makes mutagenic studies of rubisco functioning more laborious as with any new residue added the number of mutant combinations to be tested rises exponentially. however the integration of phylogenetic and biochemical approaches might be beneficial for understanding of rubisco functional mechanisms. as natural variation among the kinetic parameters of rubiscos from different species mainly depends on environmental pressure rather than phylogenetic factors  <cit> , the integration of rubisco activity essays with molecular phylogenetic analysis in a group of closely related plant species occupying contrasting environments could give direct evidence of how rubisco evolves in nature.

implications for phylogenetic studies
although rbcl was used in hundreds of phylogenetic studies, only in a small fraction of them was it treated as a biological molecule, not as "strings of anonymous nucleotides, without function"  <cit> . our analysis demonstrated that rbcl can not be regarded as a neutral marker and positive selection is fairly common in this gene. källersjö and coauthors  <cit>  simultaneously analyzed  <dig> rbcl sequences by parsimony jackknifing and found that the first and second codon positions together contain  <dig> informative positions which support  <dig> clades, whereas  <dig> informative third positions support  <dig> clades, clearly showing that the third positions on average have a stronger phylogenetic signal. these findings do not support frequent assumption that when changes occur more often in the third position, they are likely to contain more homoplasy and provide less phylogenetically reliable information then more conservative first and second positions  <cit> . positive selection may also result in homoplasy due to fixations of the same mutation that arose independently in several phylogenetic lineages. as most substitutions in the third codon positions are synonymous, the third codon positions are less frequent targets of positive selection compared to the first and second ones. thus, findings that the first and second codon positions in rbcl have a lesser phylogenetic signal then expected  <cit>  can be explained by widespread positive selection on rbcl.

we tested whether the removal of codons evolving under positive selection will improve phylogenetic resolution in  <dig> groups with detected positive selection . we compared sums of bootstrap values between the trees reconstructed using all sites and the trees reconstructed using only neutrally evolving sites . the sums of bootstrap frequencies did not increase or decrease for more than 5% in 41% of analyzed cases; decreased for more than 5% in 29% of cases, and increased for more than 5% in 30% of cases. in two cases, deletion of codons evolving under positive selection resulted in more than 55% increase of the total bootstrap support . thus, taking into account the presence of positive selection in rbcl may improve phylogenetic reconstructions. we recommend checking rbcl datasets for positive selection, and if selection is found, to test whether deletion of sites evolving under positive selection from further phylogenetic analyses would increase topological resolution/bootstrap support of the selected branches. alternatively, sites evolving under positive selection could be appropriately modelled for improving their contribution into phylogenetic signal, although there is no available "ready to use" program which can do it at the moment.

adaptive mutations may spread across subpopulations of a species, or across several species with very little gene flow  <cit> . thus, positive selection in rubisco may facilitate horizontal interspecific gene flow for chloroplast dna, as spreading of adaptive mutations in rbcl may result in fixation of a single chloroplast haplotype in several occasionally hybridising species, which may dramatically affect phylogeny reconstruction. previously we detected strong cytonuclear discordance apparently caused by positive selection in rbcl in the hawaiian endemic plant genus schiedea  <cit> . this illustrates the danger of reconstructing phylogenetic relations solely from chloroplast data in groups with putative interspecific hybridization: tests for the presence of positive selection and for the congruence between chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies are essential for correct inference of species phylogenetic relations.

CONCLUSIONS
our molecular phylogenetic analysis unexpectedly revealed that positive selection in the rbcl gene of terrestrial land plants is quite a common phenomenon. on the other hand, positive selection in cyanobacteria, algae and aquatic land plants is less prominent, which may possibly be explained by more stable conditions of aquatic environment compared to terrestrial one. the residues involved in dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small subunit and rubisco-rubisco activase interactions as well as ones close to the active site are apparently the prime targets of positive selection in rubisco. widespread adaptive evolution in rbcl may reflect the perpetual fine-tuning of rubisco to optimize its performance in changing gaseous and thermal conditions and/or co-evolution of proteins in the rubisco complex. the integration of phylogenetic and biochemical research is required to test the hypothesis that darwinian selection during rubisco evolution is driven by continuous fine-tuning to changing conditions. widespread positive selection in rbcl has to be taken into account when this gene is used for phylogenetic reconstructions specifically when interspecific hybridization is possible.
