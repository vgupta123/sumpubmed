BACKGROUND
celiac disease is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, occurring in  <dig> out of 100– <dig> people worldwide  <cit> . cd is driven by an abnormal immune response to the ingestion of gluten in genetically  predisposed individuals. among these gluten proteins, gliadin is exceptionally resistant to enzymatic degradation due to its high proline and glutamine content  <cit> . the pt-gliadin can cross the membrane of enterocytes and provoke damage in a variety of ways. firstly, the binding of gliadin to the cxcr <dig> receptor results in the increased release of the protein zonulin, which can lead to impaired mucosal integrity. gliadin can then enter enterocytes by transcytosis or retrotranscytosis via secretory iga through the transferrin receptor cd <dig>  <cit> . the release of p31–43/ <dig> peptides triggers the innate immune response  <cit> , localizes to endocytic vesicles which leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β and tnf-α, and impaired mucosal integrity  <cit> . p31- <dig> interferes with the endocytic pathway by causing delay maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes, thus affecting various metabolic pathways and cellular functions  <cit> . the 33-mer  gliadin can also penetrate into the lamina propria, triggering the t-helper cell mediated adaptive immune response  <cit>  that contributes to the ongoing inflammation in the small intestine of cd patients  <cit> .

currently, there is no pharmacological therapy available for cd patients. only strict adherence to a gfd helps to alleviate symptoms. finding a more convenient, safe, and cost-effective way of relieving symptoms would contribute greatly to the quality of life for these patients, and one avenue of study includes how to prevent triggering the immune system upon the ingestion of gluten. potential therapeutic options include the hydrolysis of toxic gliadin by exogenous enzymes  <cit> , the modification of gliadin-derived peptide pattern by bifidobacteria  <cit> , the prevention of gliadin absorption by polymeric binders  <cit> , the inhibition of tight junction opening by zonulin antagonists  <cit> , the blockage of selective deamidation of specific glutamine residues by tissue tranglutaminase inhibitors  <cit> , the restoration of immune tolerance towards gluten by vaccines  <cit> , the modulation of immune response to gliadin by nkg2d/mica blockers  <cit>  and the neutralization of gliadin in vivo by igy antibody  <cit> .

among these, oral passive immunotherapy may be the best avenue to pursue simply by virtue of its advantages, including safety, reduced cost, ease of administration, and potential to treat localized conditions in the gastrointestinal tract   <cit> . chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin  is ideal for passive immunotherapy, as it may be readily obtained in large quantities from egg yolk. compared to the traditional method of harvesting mammalian antibodies, igy purification is more cost-effective, convenient, and hygienic. igy antibodies have already been shown to be effective in neutralizing disease-causing pathogens such as rotavirus  <cit> , e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> , salmonella enteritis  <cit> , clostridium perfringens  <cit> . despite this, there is only limited information available that describes the use of igy antibodies in neutralizing toxic gliadin in an intestinal epithelium culture system. the caco- <dig> cell line has been used in several studies as an ex vivo model of cd intestinal epithelia for initial testing of novel cd treatment options . in this study, caco- <dig> cell cultures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-gliadin igy in inhibiting gliadin induced impaired intestinal integrity, gliadin absorption and the inflammatory response induced by gliadin.

the objectives of this study are to produce anti-gliadin igy antibodies by immunizing chickens with gliadin, to purify the resultant igy antibodies by gel chromatography, and to characterize its reactivity to gliadin by western blot and elisa techniques. the anti-gliadin igy antibodies were then tested for its efficacy in preventing gliadin induced impaired intestinal integrity and inflammatory response in caco- <dig> cell cultures.

RESULTS
production of anti-gliadin igy
the anti-gliadin igy antibodies obtained from chickens immunized with sigma gliadin, wheat gliadin or pt-gliadin were weekly titrated by indirect elisa. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the titre of anti-gliadin igy was undetectable on day  <dig>  rapidly increased  from week  <dig> to  <dig>  and then remained relatively constant  during week 5– <dig> periods. among three gliadins, chickens produced the highest anti-gliadin igy in response to wheat gliadin , throughout the immunization period. therefore, anti-wheat gliadin igy was used for further studies.fig.  <dig> specific igy antibody elisa values in the egg yolk from chickens immunized with sigma gliadin , wheat gliadin , and pepsin-trypsin resistant gliadin   in pbs, emulsified with freund’s incomplete adjuvant. booster immunizations were given at  <dig> and 6 weeks after the initial immunization. values are the mean of quadruple samples, with vertical bars indicating the standard deviation. arrows indicated times of immunization



after 5– <dig> weeks of immunization, the egg yolks from wheat gliadin immunized chickens were pooled for purification of igy by sephacryl s- <dig> gel chromatography. the elution profile shows that fractions corresponding to kav  <dig> – <dig>  contain igy determined by indirect elisa . yield of total igy as shown in table  <dig> was similar regardless of the different gliadin immunizations . however, the concentration of specific anti-gliadin igy was significantly higher in sigma gliadin, wheat gliadin, and pt-gliadin immunized chickens than in the non-immunized chickens . sephacryl s- <dig> purified igy fractions against sigma gliadin, wheat gliadin, and pt-gliadin contain approximately  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of specific anti-gliadin igy in a total of igy antibodies, respectively.fig.  <dig> igy purification by sephacryl s- <dig> chromatography. each value of absorbance was determined by an indirect elisa. flow rate: 3 ml/h, column:  <dig>  × 110 cm

sigma and wheat gliadins showed similar molecular weight in the range of 30–70 kda analyzed by sds-urea-page . on the other hand, the sds-page showed that pt-gliadin contained a single peptide band at 22 kda. western blot assay  was performed to determine the anti-wheat gliadin igy reaction to the three gliadins. the result shows that the anti-wheat gliadin igy reacted with sigma and wheat gliadins at a range of 30–70 kda and pt-gliadin at 22 kda, indicating the cross-reactivity of the anti-wheat gliadin igy to other gliadin fragments separated by the electrophoresis. another method, elisa, was used to determine the cross-reactivity of the anti-wheat gliadin igy to sigma gliadin, pt-gliadin, barley prolamin, rye prolamins, oat prolamins and non-prolamin containing grains . the cross reactivity was calculated based on reference to 100 % reactivity to wheat gliadin . the cross-reactivity of anti-wheat gliadin igy was highest to sigma gliadin , followed by barley prolamin , rye prolamin  and oat prolamin . anti-wheat gliadin igy also showed high cross-reactivity to pt-gliadin , whereas the antibody cross-reactivity for non-prolamin-containing grains was neglectable . non-specific igy, used as negative control antibody, showed no cross reactivity to the prolamin-containing grains mentioned above.fig.  <dig> gliadin fractions from sigma: sg; wheat: wg; and; pepsin-trypsin digested sigma-gliadin: ptg  on a) electrophoresis gel stained with comassie blue and; b) western blot assay with anti-wheat gliadin igy



igy neutralization of toxic gliadin
to evaluate the neutralizing effect of anti-gliadin igy on gliadin-induced intestinal integrity deterioration, caco- <dig> cells were exposed to different ratios of anti-gliadin igy and pt-gliadin. at 21 days, after seeding cells on the transwell inserts, the teer values were in the range of 305– <dig> Ω cm <dig> in well-formed caco- <dig> monolayers. caco- <dig> monolayers have non-significant changes in teer values after 4 h in pbs, pd-casein and non-specific igy  . upon 4 h exposure to pt-gliadin there was a significant decrease in teer value of 52 %, as compared to exposures to negative control conditions in teer value of 85 %. basal teer value of caco <dig> monolayers at time zero is considered to have teer value of 100 %. when the caco <dig> monolayers were exposed to anti-gliadin igy and pt-gliadin at a ratio of 1:  <dig>   for 4 h,  , there was no significant teer value change. this indicates that anti-gliadin igy neutralized the toxic gliadin and prevented gliadin-induced impairment of intestinal integrity. anti-gliadin igy at higher ratio  showed similar effects to caco <dig> monolayers exposed to anti-gliadin igy and pt-gliadin at a ratio of 1:  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> relative teer and phenol red permeation measurements to determine effects of anti- gliadin igy in caco- <dig> cells. pancreatic digested casein  ; pt-gliadin ; non-specific igy ; anti-gliadin igy  and pt-gliadin  . † indicates statistically significant decrease in teer value . ‡ indicates statistically significant permeation of phenol red . values are shown as mean ± sd. analysis of each group was done in triplicates per plate. five plates were repeated 



the monolayer integrity was determined teer in the range of 305– <dig> Ω cm <dig> which is mirrored by < 1 % passage of phenol red from the apical to basal chamber. phenol red was added to the apical chamber to determine its permeability into the basal chamber after 4 h of exposure. upon 4 h incubation with pbs and pd-casein as controls, < 6 % phenol red permeated into the basal chamber and < 10 % reduction in teer value , indicating minimal disturbed intestinal integrity. after incubation for 4 h with pt-gliadin, there was a significant permeation of  <dig>  % phenol red into the basal chamber  and relative teer value of approximately 52 %  . incubation with anti-gliadin igy alone did not affect the intestinal integrity. when the monolayers were exposed to three different ratios of anti-gliadin igy and pt-gliadin for 4 h, there was minimal phenol red permeation of  <dig> - <dig>  % , indicating that anti-gliadin igy successfully prevented gliadin induced impairment of intestinal integrity at a ratio of 1: <dig> .

effect of anti-gliadin igy on gliadin permeation in caco <dig> monolayer
pt-gliadin was added to the apical chamber with/without anti-gliadin igy to determine its permeability from the apical chamber into the basal chamber. upon caco- <dig> monolayer exposure to pt-gliadin for 4 h, significant decrease in caco- <dig> monolayer integrity was observed, resulting in pt-gliadin translocation of  <dig>  % of total pt-gliadin subjected to the apical chamber into the basal chamber . this is contrasted with the exposure to three different ratios of anti-gliadin igy and pt-gliadin for 4 h, where the passage of gliadin into the basal chamber was inhibited leading to undetectable levels of pt-gliadin in the basal chamber. table  <dig> showed that approximately 94 % of pt-gliadin was recovered in the apical chambers of monolayers exposed to three different ratios of anti-gliadin igy and pt-gliadin for 4 h. however, the pt-gliadin was not detected in basal chamber, indicating that the rest of gliadin  may be located in the epithelial cells. thus, anti-gliadin igy neutralized pt-gliadin in the apical chamber, blocking gliadin absorption through the caco- <dig> monolayer.table  <dig> gliadin content quantified in the apical and basal chamber of caco- <dig> cell cultures exposed to digested gliadin with/without anti-wheat gliadin

discussion
cd is caused by the exposure of pt-gliadin containing toxic 13-mer  and 33-mer  peptides , to the intestinal lumen of genetically susceptible individuals. the pt-gliadin is absorbed from intestinal lumen into the gut mucosa through transcellular and paracellular means  <cit> , causing the pathophysiologic processes in cd and its clinical presentations.

several therapeutic approaches have been attempted to neutralize or prevent gliadin absorption. as this is the initial step of gliadin-induced toxicity in cd individuals, it would prevent further damage to enterocytes. alv <dig>  a mixture of glutenase and endoprotease, was reported to enzymatically hydrolyze toxic gliadin peptides  <cit> . these enzymes may hydrolyze peptides other than gliadin in the git. another candidate being extensively studied is larazotide, which inhibits zonulin, and in turn prevents toxic gliadin peptide absorption  <cit> . this drug candidate inhibits the paracellular route of gliadin absorption through tight junctions, but would not fully inhibit gliadin-induced damage as there are another mechanisms of gliadin absorption, i.e. through transcellular pathways. this strategy might therefore be best exploited in combination with other treatments. p is another interesting polymer reported to attenuate gliadin-induced changes in permeability and inflammation  <cit> . further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms of action and their interaction with human tissues. all these therapeutic candidates are promising, but further studies are required to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and practicality of such treatments. among these, oral passive antibody has potential as a therapeutic option for cd.

oral antibody passive immunotherapy is of significant value by virtue of its advantages, including reduced cost, ease of administration, and potential to treat localized conditions in the git  <cit> . several studies have examined the use of igy against enteric pathogens such as salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium  <cit> , e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> , e. coli 987p  <cit> , and clostridium perfringens  <cit> . antibodies have the ability to bind and sequester gliadin  <cit> , and so we used laying hens to produce igy specific to gliadin. the use of laying hens as potent antibody producers has numerous advantages over mammalian polyclonal antibody production including the high antibody content, the relative ease of using eggs versus serum, the low cost of animal maintenance, and the availability of large quantities of eggs. laying hens usually lay about  <dig> eggs  in a year, compared to the serum collected from a rabbit that is only about 40 ml. one gram of egg yolk laid by the immunized hen contains about 10 mg of igy whereas 1 ml of rabbit serum yields about 35 mg of igg  <cit> . the use of igy may improve the gliadin-binding efficacy because igy is polyclonal, and is therefore able to bind to multiple epitopes on various fractions of pt-gliadin. in addition, there is an economical advantage by replacing the expensive monoclonal antibody with inexpensive chicken egg yolk igy. our previous in vivo mice feeding study has also proved that anti-gliadin igy prevented > 99 % gliadin absorption in the git of mice fed with gliadin and anti-gliadin igy  <cit> . hence, this anti-gliadin igy produced has potential to be used as a therapeutic oral antibody for cd to neutralize enzyme resistant gliadin in the git.

the small-bowel mucosal biopsy organ culture system has been used extensively to clarify the pathogenesis of cd. the advantage of the system comes from the fact that it contains a number of different cell types so that any element of the system can be investigated, from the epithelium through to the mucosal lamina propria. cd researchers have used this model to study the immune mechanisms  <cit> , as well as the contribution of different cytokines  <cit> . another investigative method involves biopsy samples. the toxic effect of gliadin is detectable with biopsy samples from active cd patients and short-term treated  cd patients who are likely still to have mucosal iga deposits present. if the cd mucosa is taken from cd patients on gfd for > 4 years, the biopsy samples do not secrete autoantibodies to the supernatant due to overall absence of plasma cells and helper t cells, as well as the failure of memory b cells to become activated  <cit> . this method has been widely used in studies aiming to clarify the pathogenesis of cd, but it is not widely used in studies related to novel treatment developments. in this study, we employed caco- <dig> epithelial cell instead in order to determine the ability of anti-gliadin igy to inhibit gliadin absorption at epithelial level, as there is no additional benefit to use the model with underlying celiac pathogenesis.

in literature, caco- <dig> monolayers have been used to study the inflammatory response induced by gram-positive and -negative bacterial cell surface polysaccharides, teichoic acid, protein a, peptidoglycans, lipid a-associated proteins, lipoproteins and deoxyribonucleic acid, to regulate cytokine synthesis  <cit> . peptidoglycans, lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide, flagellin and unmethylated cpg dinucleotides in bacterial dna are also reported to bind toll-like receptors and induce cytokine synthesis in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> .

caco- <dig> monolayers is an ideal ex vivo model of cd intestinal epithelium because it has been reported to possess a variety of desirable properties upon pt-gliadin stimulation, such as decreased electrical resistance, increased absorption, induced intestinal permeability  <cit> , exerted pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> , and stimulated release of proinflammatory cytokines , all upon pt-gliadin stimulation  <cit> . caco- <dig> cell cultures have been employed to study the effects of potential cd treatments, including a zonulin antagonist   <cit> , bifidobacteria  <cit> , germinating cereal enzymes  <cit> , and polymeric binders of gliadin  <cit> . thus, caco- <dig> monolayers are an established model used to evaluate the efficacy of anti-gliadin igy in neutralizing toxic gliadin at intestinal epithelium level. however, there is also possibility of antibody effect directly on the epithelial cells interfering mechanism of gliadin peptides entrance  <cit> .

our results show that when the apical chamber was subjected to pt-gliadin, toxic particles flowed from the apical compartment to the basal compartment of the caco- <dig> cultures . however, the aforementioned flow of peptides was inhibited in the presence of anti-wheat-gliadin and pt-gliadin igy co-incubated cultures. this is particularly important because it indicates the ability of anti-gliadin igy to prevent the cytoskeleton rearrangement that promotes the intestinal permeability that is inherent to gliadin exposure. in this context, the minimum ratio of anti-wheat gliadin igy and pt-gliadin  contributed to maintain the intestinal barrier integrity.

li and colleagues have reported that there is a dramatic drop of caco- <dig> monolayer integrity when the culture medium was changed. this is because glutamine was lost due to a catastrophic loss of electrical resistance. as glutamine is important for intestinal barrier function, it follows that caco- <dig> monolayer integrity deteriorated. membranes were able to recover after 1 h, and it takes up to 2–4 h for protein synthesis to recover.  <cit> . this is why we incubated pt-gliadin and/or anti-gliadin igy for 4 h to evaluate their effects on intestinal integrity. other researchers have reported impaired intestinal integrity of caco- <dig> monolayers after 6 h  <cit> , and 3 h  <cit>  exposure to pt-gliadin.

in the present study, pt-gliadin has also shown to trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines , as a result of pro-inflammatory pathways  activation. nf-kb is activated in the small intestinal mucosa of cd patients  <cit> , and gluten peptides have been shown to upregulate the expression of cytokines such as tnf-α  <cit>  and il-1β  <cit> . tnf-α detected in the presence of anti-gliadin igy with intestinal digests of gliadins at a 1: <dig>  ratio, demonstrated that anti-gliadin igy was not enough to neutralize gliadin in the caco- <dig> cell cultures. with higher igy concentration , anti-gliadin igy was able to completely abolish the tnf-α and il-1β production . the latter can be explained by inhibition of nf-kb induction due to the gliadin neutralization efficacy of anti-gliadin igy. nf-kb  is made inactive by ik-b in the cytosol. exposure to gliadin prompts phosphorylation and results in destruction of ik-b  <cit> . after destruction of ikb, nf-kb enters the nucleus and binds with dna-activating genes that encode for the increased inflammatory mediators  production, leading to cellular dysfunction and tissue destruction  <cit> .

tnf-α together with il-1β are the important cytokines that are involved in nos activation, both of which act as mediators to facilitate the interaction of intraepithelial lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells promoting tissue inflammation  <cit> . in addition, tnf-α also has a positive effect on attraction of neutrophils, which cause perpetuation of inflammatory responses, cell damage, and eventually epithelial barrier dysfunction  <cit> .

there are several attempts reported in literature on treatment of cd by inhibiting gliadin-induced inflammatory responses at intracellular or submucosal level, such as zonulin antagonist  <cit> , tissue transglutaminase inhibitors  <cit> , peptide vaccine  <cit> , and nkg2d/mica blocker  <cit> .

in our previous study we used anti-gliadin igy antibody to show its inherent ability in a diagnostic role. with anti-gliadin igy used as capture antibody and biotinylated mab as detecting antibody, a highly sensitive das-elisa was developed, with linear standard range of 4–40 ng/ml and the limit of detection equivalent to  <dig>  ppm in foods  <cit> . in the present study we have used anti-gliadin igy antibody to establish its potential therapeutic role. the anti-gliadin igy antibody used in this study aims to neutralize intestinal digests of gliadin peptides , inhibiting gliadin-induced cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory responses at intra-luminal level before they enter the small intestine, ultimately preventing the gliadin induced inflammatory events in cd. thus, oral administration of anti-gliadin igy may contribute to maintaining healthy and normal intestine by masking ingested gliadin peptides. however, it warrants further in vivo animal and human studies for anti-gliadin igy to reach its realm of cd therapeutics.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the anti-wheat gliadin igy antibody produced in this study has proved to inhibit the absorption of gliadin and release of gliadin-induced inflammatory response in caco <dig> cell culture model of cd. as a result, the epithelial monolayer of the small intestine remains undisturbed upon gliadin stimulation. the reported data extends the spectrum of functional effects attributable to igy antibodies, and may provide a rationale for their potential role in other diseases where gastrointestinal immune function is triggered by antigens other than gliadin.
