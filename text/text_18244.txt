BACKGROUND
cubilin is a 460-kda peripheral membrane protein expressed by a number of absorptive epithelial cells including those of the renal proximal convoluted tubule, ileum and yolk sac extraembryonic visceral endoderm   <cit> . the first described function of cubilin was as the receptor for intrinsic factor-vitamin b12/cobalamin , serving a critical role in the intestinal absorption of cbl  <cit> . cubilin was later shown to be an endocytic receptor for apolipoprotein a-i /high density lipoprotein , mediating uptake of hdl in the kidney and ve  <cit> . other cubilin ligands include albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin light chains, vitamin d-binding protein, myoglobin, galectin- <dig> and clara cell secretory protein  <cit> .

three cell surface integral membrane proteins have been shown to interact with cubilin. the first identified was megalin, an endocytic receptor belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor  family  <cit> . megalin functions together with cubilin to mediate endocytosis of apoa-i/hdl, presumably facilitating endocytosis of the cubilin-apoa-i/hdl complex. the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor ii-receptor  is another endocytic receptor that binds to cubilin  <cit> , although the functional significance of its interaction with cubilin remains to be established. the ~48-kda type i transmembrane protein, amnionless , is the most recent integral membrane protein found to interact with cubilin  <cit> . amn is essential for efficient transport of cubilin to the apical cell surface as well as for membrane anchoring of cubilin  <cit> ,

given the fact that cubilin is expressed by trophectoderm and ve  <cit> , it is believed to play an important role in maternal-embryonic transport of nutrients. several additional pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. first, cubilin has been shown to mediate ve uptake of holoparticle hdl, hdl-associated cholesterol and apolipoprotein a-i  <cit> . furthermore, the work of sahali et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that cubilin monoclonal antibodies infused into circulation of pregnant rats , bound to ve cubilin and induced a spectrum of developmental abnormalities and embryonic resorption within 24– <dig> hours of infusion. the abnormalities included retarded embryonic growth, craniofacial defects involving the eye, ear and neural tube, hydrocephaly and telencephalic hypoplasia. similarly, growth retardation and morphological anomalies were obtained when rat embryos  were cultured ex utero in the presence of cubilin antibodies  <cit> . here we characterize the consequences of targeted deletion of the mouse cubilin gene on embryonic development.

RESULTS
generation of cubilin-/- mice
to generate mice with targeted disruption of the cubilin gene  we cloned and fully mapped the exon-intron structure of the 5' portion of the murine cubilin gene. a mouse cubilin gene-targeting vector was designed to create a null mutation through deletion of exons 1– <dig> . after electroporation of the construct and g <dig> positive selection and fiau negative selection, ten es clones  were identified that had the desired recombination based on southern analysis  . targeted es clones were injected into c57bl/6j blastocysts and the blastocysts were transferred to foster mothers to obtain chimeric mice. two male chimeras were obtained from the first targeted es cell line tested and found to be germ line competent through the generation of heterozygous offspring. as shown in figure 1c, southern analysis confirmed that offspring from one of these mice contained the properly targeted cubilin allele.

the cubilin exon 1– <dig> deletion leads to embryonic lethality
genotypic analysis was performed on  <dig> offspring from heterozygous intercross matings. as a result,  <dig> wild-type,  <dig> heterozygous and no homozygous offspring were detected . these non-mendelian ratios indicate that lethality occurs in embryos homozygous for the targeted cubilin gene deletion. furthermore, since the frequency of heterozygotes at  <dig> weeks was much lower than expected , embryonic lethality appeared to be occurring in some heterozygotes. to substantiate this possibility we performed genotypic analysis of  <dig> 4-wk offspring from wild-type × heterozygote matings. as a result,  <dig> wild-type and  <dig> heterozygous offspring were detected. based on a chi-square test of these data and a resulting p value =  <dig> , the data are consistent with the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of cubilin causes embryonic lethality, although with incomplete penetrance.

table i genotype frequency of progeny from heterozygote  matings

asterisk indicates that the chi-square test was based on a 1: <dig> ratio of wild-type to heterozygote offspring.

retrograde genotypic analysis was performed on embryos from heterozygous intercross matings . at  <dig>  dpc homozygous embryos were obtained at a frequency consistent with a normal mendelian ratio. from  <dig> – <dig>  dpc, homozygous embryos were detected, but not at a frequency in accordance with mendelian expectations . after  <dig>  dpc, no homozygous embryos were detected. together, these findings indicate that homozygous embryos die over a range of developmental stages between  <dig>  to  <dig>  dpc. consistent with this conclusion was the relatively high number of embryo resorptions observed after  <dig>  dpc .

to establish that embryos homozygous for the targeted cubilin gene deletion of exons 1– <dig> were indeed cubilin null, rt-pcr analysis was performed using two primer pairs designed to amplify separate 5' and 3' regions of the cubilin transcript. no cubilin mrna was detectable by either primer pair using rna isolated from homozygous  <dig>  dpc embryos . furthermore, immunohistological analysis confirmed that there was no cubilin detectable in paraffin embedded sections of homozygous  <dig>  dpc embryos .

developmental retardation and mesodermal defects of homozygous embryos
morphological analysis of 8– <dig>  dpc embryos revealed that homozygous embryos were considerably smaller than wild-type or heterozygous littermates . mutant 8– <dig>  dpc embryos were morphologically similar to wild-type  <dig>  dpc embryos. however, rather than exhibiting a normal cylindrical shape, mutant 8– <dig>  embryos appeared acorn shaped owing to a relatively smaller embryonic component as compared to extraembryonic component.

histological examination of null 8– <dig>  dpc embryos revealed that all mutant embryos underwent gastrulation, but did not form somites . in contrast, 8– <dig>  dpc wild-type littermates had formed 3– <dig> somites. other mesodermal structures did form in the 8– <dig>  dpc mutants, albeit with some variability. for example, an allantois was present in  <dig> of  <dig> mutant 8– <dig>  dpc embryos examined. most mutant embryos  also had an amnion and chorion, tissues having mesoderm components. while blood islands formed in the yolk sacs of all 8– <dig>  dpc mutants they appeared unusually large, extending into the exocoelomic cavity to a greater extent than wild-type blood islands . such blood islands appeared to have a larger than normal number of mesodermal cells. additionally, blood island hematopoietic development appeared to be retarded as evidenced by the failure of the cells to exhibit the characteristic rounded hematopoietic cell morphology .

by  <dig>  dpc, surviving homozygous embryos had not undergone axial rotation but displayed an overall morphological appearance of wild-type 8– <dig> -dpc embryos . mutant  <dig>  dpc embryos had formed a primitive heart and neural head folds   and paired dorsal aortae , but lacked somites. homozygous embryos surviving beyond  <dig>  dpc  were also grossly similar to wild-type  <dig>  dpc embryos, but still lacked somites . together these findings indicate that lack of cubilin results in developmental retardation that initiates prior to  <dig>  dpc, and a failure to achieve developmental milestones appropriate for a wild-type  <dig>  dpc embryo, most notably, failure to form somites. the complete lack of somites at  <dig>  dpc suggests that the basis is due to some defect of the paraxial mesoderm rather than merely being a consequence of retarded development.

it is important to note that embryos confirmed by genotyping to be heterozygous were indistinguishable morphologically from wild-type littermates over a range of stages examined extending from 7– <dig>  dpc . this indicates that the lethality of heterozygous embryos, apparent from genotypic analysis, is occurring beyond  <dig>  dpc.

failure of yolk sac blood vessels to undergo remodeling
to assess the effects on blood vessel formation, embryos from heterozygous matings were immunolabeled with anti-pecam- <dig>  as shown in figure 6a, yolk sac blood vessel formation in  <dig>  dpc mutants appeared retarded as compared to wild-type littermates . normally by  <dig>  dpc the yolk sac vessels of the wild-type embryo have undergone remodeling to form larger diameter vessels . by contrast, the pattern of yolk sac vascular development in  <dig>  dpc mutants appeared as an interconnected network of small diameter blood vessels , a pattern similar to that seen in an  <dig>  dpc wild-type embryo yolk sac. in some areas of the extraembryonic yolk sac, pecam- <dig> labeling often showed enlarged sinusoidal-like vessels , which was consistent with the enlarged blood island-like structures observed in h&e stained sections .

when the pecam-1-labeled yolk sac vasculature of  <dig>  dpc mutants was compared to that of wild-type embryos it was again evident that the blood vessels of homozygous embryos had not progressed beyond that of  <dig>  dpc wild-type embryos. as shown in figure 6d, yolk sac blood vessels of an  <dig>  dpc mutant had not undergone the remodeling that normally occurs after  <dig>  dpc.

in addition to the yolk sac vascular remodeling anomalies, the allantoic vasculature of  <dig>  dpc mutants was aberrant. instead of a branched central blood vessel normally present in an  <dig>  dpc embryo  <cit> , the allantoic blood vessels of  <dig>  dpc mutants were bulbous and lacked branching . since this abnormality was not observed in  <dig>  dpc mutants, it can be concluded that dysmorphogenesis of the allantoic vasculature occurs after  <dig>  dpc and perhaps contributes to a chorioallantoic placental defect.

abnormalities of embryonic and visceral endoderm in cubilin mutants
considering that cubilin is normally present on the apical surface of the columnar ve  and on a population of the squamous cells within the embryonic endoderm    <cit> , we next evaluated the impact of cubilin deficiency on these embryonic endodermal tissues. examination of homozygous 8– <dig>  dpc embryos revealed a number of endodermal anomalies . in place of a normal squamous definitive endoderm , the mutant embryos had both cuboidal and columnar cells arranged in a stratified cuboidal epithelium  as well as simple columnar epithelium . additionally, mutant cells in these epithelia had apical processes that may be either microvilli or cilia. such luminal surface structures are normally not found on ee cells. based on the findings, the absence of cubilin inhibits the formation of an epithelium morphologically comparable to that of a normal definitive endoderm at this stage, however, it remains to be determined whether this is a result of a defect in the specification and differentiation of the definitive endoderm.

examination of the ve of homozygous 8– <dig>  dpc embryos revealed it to also be morphologically abnormal. in contrast to the simple columnar ve of normal embryos, the ve of cubilin mutants was a stratified epithelium, comprised of cuboidal and columnar cells. furthermore, mutant ve cells also lacked the large apical vacuoles that are characteristic of ve cells . given the morphological similarities between the cells of mutant embryonic endoderm there was not a discernable demarcation between the normally distinct ee and ve epithelia. however, a clear demarcation between the ve and an epithelium that would normally be ee was evident upon immunohistological analysis of gfp reporter expression  and megalin expression in mutant  <dig>  dpc embryos . this indicated that although being morphologically similar, the ve and presumed ee of mutants were distinct at the molecular level. furthermore, the fact that megalin was appropriately expressed on the apical surfaces of the mutant ve indicated that cubilin is not required to direct cell surface trafficking of megalin.

the visceral endoderm of homozygous embryos does not mediate uptake of maternal-derived hdl
a normal function of ve is to mediate uptake of maternal-derived hdl  <cit> . we therefore evaluated the capacity of cubilin-deficient ve to mediate uptake of maternal-derived hdl. as shown in figure  <dig>  the ve of heterozygous  <dig>  dpc embryos from dii-hdl-infused mothers showed strong dii labeling within ve cells. dii label in these embryos was present exclusively in ve which is the only yolk sac endodermal component expressing cubilin as evidenced by expression of the cubilin gene reporter, egfp. by contrast, there was no detectable dii labeling of the ve of homozygous embryos . these findings indicate that ve uptake of hdl is a cubilin dependent process.

discussion
considering that cubilin forms a complex with amn , that amn and cubilin are co-expressed in absorptive epithelial including the ve  <cit> , and that amn is required to mediate key aspects of cubilin function   <cit> , it is not surprising that the phenotype of amn-deficient mutants  <cit>  closely resembles that of the cubilin nulls described. like the cubilin null embryos, amn-deficient embryos display arrested development, with most mutants not advancing morphologically beyond a normal 8– <dig>  dpc embryo. on a mixed 129sv/c57bl/ <dig> genetic background, both mutants form an amnion. general mesoderm formation in the cubilin and amn mutant embryos appears normal in that both mutants form an allantois, blood islands, yolk sac blood vessels and a heart. however, both mutants fail to form somites, indicating that somitogenesis is in some manner defective . both mutants also display endoderm defects as evidenced by the inability of cubilin-deficient ve to facilitate uptake of maternal hdl and the inability of amn-deficient ve and ee to support wild-type epiblast development in chimeric embryos  <cit> . the morphological abnormalities of ve and definitive endoderm observed in the cubilin mutants also highlight the importance of cubilin in formation and/or maintenance of these epithelia. such morphological abnormalities were not reported in the phenotype of amn-deficient mutants. it remains to be established whether cubilin and amn are playing roles in the specification and differentiation of the definitive endoderm, which forms during gastrulation by the recruitment of epiblast cells through the primitive streak  <cit> .

the close similarities between the phenotypes of mouse amn and cubilin mutants also suggest that both genes act co-operatively in the ve to support embryonic growth and to control the formation of paraxial mesoderm. how amn and cubilin mechanistically mediate these processes remains to be resolved. the endocytic function of the cubam complex and its apical expression in ve supports the possibility that it functions in the transport of vital maternal nutrients/factors. the spectrum of maternally derived nutrients/factors transported by ve cubam is potentially quite broad considering the multi-ligand binding capacity of cubilin which includes albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin light chains, vitamin d-binding protein, myoglobin, galectin- <dig>  clara cell secretory protein, apoa-i and hdl  <cit> . furthermore, at least one cubilin ligand, hdl, is a complex of multiple factors including apolipoproteins, phospholipids, cholesterol and lipid soluble vitamins such as retinol, which is converted to retinoic acid through the action of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase- <dig> . indeed, genetic deficiency of mouse raldh <dig> leads to early embryo lethality , absence or reduction in somites, yolk sac vascular defects, enlarged heart and a failure of embryos to undergo axial rotation  <cit> , all similar to cubilin and amn mutants.

by contrast to the developmental anomalies and early lethality of the cubilin and amnionless nulls, megalin-deficient mice die perinatally and display abnormal morphogenesis of the forebrain , lung and kidney  <cit> . thus, despite the evidence that megalin functions together with cubilin and that it is co-expressed with cubilin in the ve  <cit> , any joint function that these two proteins may have in the early embryo is evidently not vital. interestingly, mice deficient in disabled- <dig> , an adaptor of megalin, display several of the abnormalities observed in cubilin nulls including disorganization of the ve and loss of apical vesicles  <cit> . however, dab2-/- mutants arrest earlier in development than do cubilin nulls and do not undergo gastrulation. dab <dig> has also been shown to be required for cubilin endocytosis in ve  <cit> . the earlier lethality of dab <dig> null embryos may be an indication that numerous endocytic receptors expressed in the ve including megalin, cubilin and perhaps amnionless are dependent on dab <dig> 

the importance of maternal derived lipoproteins as a source of cholesterol for normal development is well established  <cit> . through the use of cubilin antagonists, the ability of cubilin to mediate ve uptake of holoparticle hdl, hdl-associated cholesterol and apoa-i has been demonstrated in mouse embryos cultured in vitro  <cit> . our findings provide in vivo evidence that early  embryonic uptake of hdl from the maternal circulation is a cubilin-dependent process of the ve. given the fact that the ve expresses apoa-i and the major ldl constituent, apob  <cit> , it is likely that cholesterol and other maternal hdl-derived constituents taken up by ve cells via cubilin are incorporated into new hdl and ldl particles and subsequently delivered to the embryo. in support of this, there is evidence that nascent lipoprotein particles have been localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles of the  <dig>  dpc mouse yolk sac and seen in the pericellular space underlying the endoderm  <cit> .

despite the fact that cubilin and amn deficiency in mice leads to embryonic lethality, mutations in human and canine amn that cause impaired apical targeting  <cit>  and function  of the cubam complex, nevertheless have no effect on embryonic development. one explanation for this apparent paradox may relate to the fact that there are species differences in yolk sac function in rodents, dogs and humans. another explanation comes from the studies of tanner et al.  <cit>  who have shown that mutations affecting exons 1– <dig> of human amn  do not prevent the production variant transcripts and polypeptides resulting from alternative transcriptional start sites and alternative translation initiation sites. indeed, the two amn mutants that cause premature termination of translation  also express an alternative amn polypeptide of  <dig> kda and several minor species of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda  <cit> . all of the alternative amn polypeptides would contain the chordin-like module, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain, but would lack various lengths of the amino terminal portion of the full-length protein. while these alternative polypeptides apparently are missing regions required for vitamin b <dig> uptake, they evidently confer enough normal function to sustain embryonic development. how these alternative polypeptides function, particularly with respect to cubilin, remains to be established. one possibility is that they retain the ability to mediate trafficking of cubilin to the apical surfaces of epithelial cells. however, mutations of the canine amn gene that disrupt cubilin intracellular trafficking have no apparent effect on embryonic development  <cit> . it is not known whether the canine amn mutants express alternative amn polypeptides similar to those observed in humans. if so, it is possible that the polypeptides possess some activity that overcomes the need for apical expression of the cubam complex to mediate normal development.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study reveals an indispensable role for cubilin in mouse embryogenesis particularly in the formation of endoderm and somites. the findings also highlight the importance of cubilin in the process of maternal-embryo transport of hdl by the ve.
