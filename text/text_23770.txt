BACKGROUND
mycobacterium bovis , a member of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, causes bovine tuberculosis   <cit> , a zoonotic disease of animals including livestock, alternative livestock , zoo and wildlife. the major wildlife reservoirs of m. bovis include eurasian badger , brushtail possums , eurasian wild boar  and white-tailed deer . for many developed nations, difficulties in eradicating bovine tb often arise due to the presence of infection in wildlife reservoirs with spillover to domestic species and movement of infected animals to bovine tb free regions. within the us, eradication of bovine tb is hampered by importation of tb cattle from mexico, the presence of a wildlife reservoir , and continued detection of small nests of infection within the domestic herd. particularly problematic for antemortem testing strategies is the detection of bovine tb in a very small number of animals in large dairy herds.

bovine tb control relies primarily on detection of tb-affected herds by slaughter surveillance and antemortem testing. while current testing strategies are generally reliable at the herd level, the development of new diagnostic strategies for effective control of bovine tb is urgently needed, particularly for movement or border tests to identify individual infected animals  <cit> . in a recent report from the united states animal health association, a key recommendation to usda, aphis, veterinary services was to assist biologics companies in the development and evaluation of improved bovine tb diagnostic tests, emphasizing both stakeholder and federal government support for the development of improved bovine tb testing strategies  <cit> .

the diagnostic assays currently available for detection of bovine tb in cattle and wildlife species could be divided mainly into  <dig> categories; direct assays  and indirect assays   <cit> . among the direct assays, bacterial culture and pcr are primarily used as postmortem tests as these tests lack the necessary sensitivity for antemortem detection of tb-infected animals and generally rely on detection of the organism within samples collected at necropsy. cell mediated immune-based assays primarily include the tuberculin skin test   <cit>  and interferon gamma  release assays  <cit> , although other strategies are under development  <cit> . in spite of advantages like simplicity of the procedure and comparatively inexpensive reagents, the tst is very labor intensive; requires two visits to the farm  and practically difficult for wildlife species. ifn-γ release assays are comparatively expensive; require overnight delivery of viable blood samples and a trained technical staff  <cit> . antibody-based assays for detection of bovine tb have shown promising results due to their short turnaround time, cost effectiveness and flexibility of use. previous studies used cross-reactive antigens and suffered from lower diagnostic specificity. the emergence of sensitive antibody-based diagnostic tests for detection of bovine tb supports the concept of development of a reliable and easy to use serologic test  <cit> .

we have previously reported an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay  using ethanol extract of mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  to detect anti-map antibodies at early stage of johne’s disease and named the assay ethanol vortex elisa   <cit> . we also reported an evelisa based assay for detection of specific antibodies in the sera of farmed red deer  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to determine the potential for application of the evelisa test to detect anti- m. bovis antibodies in the sera of infected cattle and free-ranging white-tailed deer.

methods
cattle samples
a total of  <dig> sera samples from cattle were obtained from the tb serum bank at us department of agriculture – animal and plant health inspection service. the samples were obtained from farms in three states in the u.s.: georgia , michigan  and california . all the samples from georgia were from a bovine tb-free herd whereas the california and michigan samples were from m. bovis–infected cattle, as determined by mycobacterial culture, histology and is <dig> pcr techniques . the  <dig> samples from michigan and california received m. bovis ppd for caudal fold test . all the  <dig> samples in this group were also tested for quantification of cellular immune response using ifn-γ assay and comparative cervical tuberculin  test. the cct test involves injection of both m. bovis and m. avium ppd at  <dig> different sites on the neck. serum samples were obtained before or at the time of injection of ppds for skin testing. of the total animals tested,  <dig> and  <dig> animals were categorized as suspected with cft and cct, respectively.

deer samples
a total of  <dig> serum samples from white-tailed deer were obtained from the usda/aphis. twenty five samples were from uninfected animals,  <dig> samples were from naturally infected animals from michigan and  <dig> samples were from animals which were experimentally infected with m. bovis as previously described in waters et al.,  <dig>  <cit> .

preparation of ethanol extract
a virulent strain of m. bovis , which was originally isolated from an m. bovis infected dairy cow, was cultured in middlebrook’s 7h <dig> medium  with addition of  <dig> % tween  <dig> , 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-nacl  at 37°c. for antigen preparation, m. bovis bacilli was harvested from stationary phase cultures, suspended in 80% ethanol at 80 mg wet weight of bacterial/ml and agitated by vortex at room temperature for 2 min, and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 10 minutes to dislodge surface antigens. extracted m. bovis antigen was diluted  in the ethanol solution and 50 μl of the solution was immobilized on wells of a 96-well microtiter plate  by evaporation.

evelisa
the antigen-coated plate was incubated with 150 μl of buffer b  at room temperature for 30 min. the plate was then washed  <dig> times with 200 μl of pbst . fifty μl of serum sample  was then inoculated and incubated at room temperature for one hour. after washing the wells four times with 200 μl of pbst, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-bovine igg heavy and light chains  or 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase -conjugated rabbit anti-deer igg heavy and light chains   was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for one hour. after washing the wells four times with 200 μl of pbst, 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine  solution  was used to develop color reaction  according to manufacturer’s instruction and optical density  of the solution was determined by a microplate reader  at 450 nm after terminating the reaction by adding 100 μl of 2 m sulfuric acid.

thin layer chromatography
the ethanol extract was dried by spinning in a speed vacuum concentrator  and washed with a mixture of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol  and 200 μl of water. the organic layer was transferred to a new tube and dried. the extract was then re-suspended in a chloroform/methanol  solution at the concentration of 5 mg/ml and separated by thin layer chromatography on an aluminum-backed silica gel plate  with a development solution . the silica gel plates were then stained using a polymolybdate solution.

western blotting
to determine if m. bovis specific immunodominant antigen, mpb <dig>  was present in m. bovis ethanol extracts, a western blot using monoclonal antibody against mpb <dig>  was conducted. the extract  and recombinant protein  were mixed 1: <dig> with 2× sds-page loading dye and loaded onto a 12%  sds-page gel for electrophoretic separation. electro-transfer of proteins onto pure nitrocellulose was accomplished with the bio-rad trans blot cell  with sodium phosphate buffer  at  <dig>  a for 90 min. after transfer, nitrocellulose was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline  plus 2% bovine serum albumin  and  <dig> % tween- <dig> . monoclonal antibody was diluted 1: <dig> in block buffer and incubated on the blot at room temperature for 2 h. after three washes in pbs plus  <dig> % tween- <dig>  blots were incubated for  <dig>  h in anti-mouse-peroxidase  diluted 1: <dig>  in block buffer. the blots were again washed three times as described above and developed using supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate .

statistical analysis
all experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate, and repeated at least twice. the test sensitivity was determined by dividing the number of m. bovis culture- test positive animals by the total number of m. bovis culture positive animals, with the result expressed as a percentage. the test specificity was determined by dividing the number of btb free, test-negative animals by the total number of btb free animals, with the result expressed as a percentage. the cut-off value was determined based on the two-graph receiver operating characteristic  analysis  <cit> .

ethical approval
all animal care and use procedures were reviewed and approved by the nadc animal care and use committee.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> serum samples from uninfected  and m. bovis infected  beef - dairy cattle were used to test in the evelisa format to detect anti- m. bovis antibodies . thirty-seven  of the m. bovis uninfected animals which were obtained from tb-free herds showed lower levels of antibody binding than the tentative cut-off value of  <dig> . of the  <dig> serum samples obtained from bovine tb positive animals,  <dig> samples  showed higher antibody binding than the cut-off. of the  <dig> bovine tb positive animals with antibody binding lower than the cut-off, three animals had negative ifn-γ assay results and the other two had cct “suspect” test results. forty one serum samples from deer were tested to detect the level of anti- m. bovis antibodies in evelisa format . all of the samples from uninfected animals  showed a lower level of antibody binding than the tentative cut-off value of  <dig> . the cut-off value as determined by roc analysis was much lower than that of cattle, which may be due to lower antibody titer in deer than in cattle or lower affinity of anti-deer igg secondary antibody than that of anti-bovine igg antibody. all the samples from the bovine tb positive deer except  <dig> animal each in the naturally  and experimentally  infected groups showed higher levels of antibody binding than the cut-off. in this study, m. phlei was used to preabsorb cross-reactive antibodies in the serum samples. the preabosorption improved accuracy of evelisa when compared to that of evelisa with no-absorption . however, the cause of cross-reactive antibodies in evelisa with no-absorption is not known. the presence of m. bovis -specific molecules in the ethanol extract of m. bovis was analyzed by thin layer chromatography  and western blotting. the tlc lipid analysis suggested the presence of three m. bovis -specific lipids in the extract after staining with polymolybdate solution  when compared with lipid profile of ethanol extracts from map , map  and m. avium subsp. avium . by western blot analysis, mpb <dig> was detected in the ethanol extract . since mpb <dig> was shown to be antigenic and react with antibodies in m. bovis -infected animals, it is likely that the molecule was contributing to the antibody reaction in the evelisa test used in this study. on the other hand, the specific molecules detected by tlc may not have contributed to the antibody reaction in evelisa because antibody reaction was low when chloroform-extractable fraction of the ethanol extract was tested in an elisa format .

recent advances with use of m. bovis specific proteins such as mpb <dig>  mpb <dig>  esat- <dig>  and cfp- <dig> have improved the specificity of serologic-based assays; however, with only minimal improvement of sensitivity  <cit> . several studies have used these antigens and evaluated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. for example, de anda et al.,  <dig> reported a sensitivity of 73% using mpb <dig> in an elisa format to test 120 m. bovis infected and  <dig> cattle from bovine tb free herd  <cit> . waters et al.,  <dig> tested mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> using sera from infected cattle and reported apparent sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 98%, respectively  <cit> . esat- <dig> and cfp- <dig> were used in an elisa format by whelan et al.,  <dig> using a total of  <dig> bovine tb negative and  <dig> bovine tb positive cattle sera and stated sensitivity of  <dig> % -  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % -  <dig> %, based upon use of two different test interpretation criteria  <cit> . in the present study, we detected anti- m. bovis antibodies in  <dig> % and  <dig> % infected cattle and deer, respectively. however, the number of samples in this study is not enough to compare diagnostic accuracy and there is a need to test more samples to further validate the evelisa for use in the diagnosis of bovine tb.

CONCLUSIONS
control activities for bovine tb are being regularly discussed by the regulatory agencies since the organism has been recognized as a threat to the one health triad . serological assays with their logistics and financial advantages have proved to fit very well in the strategy for controlling bovine tb. our data indicated that evelisa test may have a diagnostic sensitivity comparative with elisa tests reported previously and warrant further studies using a larger number of samples to validate the accuracy of the test. we recently showed that serodiagnosis of johne’s disease with ethanol extract of map can be done in two minutes by a capacitance biosensor which may be a potential format for development of an on-site test for bovine tb using the m. bovis extract  <cit> .
