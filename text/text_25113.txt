BACKGROUND
trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protist responsible for the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection , with an annual estimate of  <dig> millions new infections worldwide  <cit> , corresponding to at least the combined estimates of chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorea infections, and which has, paradoxically, attracted so far relatively little attention from health agencies worldwide  <cit> . the parasite is capable of causing severe vaginal, ectocervical, prostatic and urethral inflammations, and is linked with sterility, pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, postnatal complications and cervical cancers  <cit> . furthermore t. vaginalis also contributes, along with other sti, to the hiv pandemic by boosting the efficiency of virus transmission through several possible mechanisms including induction of inflammatory response resulting in neutrophils and macrophages recruitment into urogenital mucosa, compromising the mucosal barrier through microhaemoragia, increasing viral load in urogenital mucosa secretions and as a carrier  of infective hiv particles  <cit> . hence, t. vaginalis is capable of invading and colonising the heavily defended host urogenital mucosa from both sexes, braking through the primary innate defences and withstanding induced innate and adaptive responses, about which little is known in relation to t. vaginalis infections  <cit> . notably, t. vaginalis infections are often considered non-self limiting in females and recent data even suggest that persistent, undetected infections can persist even after successful treatments  <cit> .

the pathobiology of t. vaginalis is complex and multifaceted with adhesion to, and alterations of, the various mucosal landmarks  thought to be essential to initiate and maintain infections  <cit> . t. vaginalis cells are also known to form large cell aggregates , which could represent an important process for pathogenesis  <cit> , suggesting that specific cell-cell interactions also take place between cells of the parasite. when the mucosal tissue is damaged the parasite can bind to host ecm proteins  <cit>  and during menstruation or parasite induced microhaemoragia, t. vaginalis also binds to various plasma proteins  <cit> . adhesion to host tissue also induces a cellular differentiation of t. vaginalis into amoeboid forms  <cit> . furthermore the parasite endocytoses host proteins   <cit> , as well as various human viruses  <cit> , and phagocytoses the autochthonous mucosal microflora and various host cells  <cit> , including spermatozoids  <cit> ; key cellular processes for nutrient uptake thought to dependent on specific surface proteins. however, little is known about the molecular and cellular basis of these various processes, with the pathogen lipophosphoglycan , various adhesions, surface and secreted enzymes and toxins all thought to be involved, but existing data are limited when not controversial  <cit> . a so far unique human receptor for t. vaginalis, galectin- <dig>  was only recently identified when investigating the role of t. vaginalis lpg in binding to ectocervical epithelial cell lines  <cit> .

an initial gene survey of expressed sequence tags  identified t. vaginalis cdna encoding  <dig> distinct proteins we named bspa-like   <cit> , due to their similarity with the bspa protein from tannerella forsythensis  <cit> , and led us to further characterise in silico one complete open reading frame  encoding a potential surface protein tvbspa <dig>  <cit> . tvbspa proteins are characterised by a specific type of leucine-rich repeats , named tplrr after a membrane protein from treponema pallidium  <cit> , shared with t. forsythensis bspa and treponema denticola lrra proteins  <cit> . this discovery was particularly appealing for t. vaginalis because the bspa and lrra proteins were shown to be expressed on the bacteria cell surface and to be involved in the colonisation of the oral mucosa; bspa binds to ecm protein fibronectin and to the clotting factor fibrinogen and both bspa and lrra stimulate co-aggregation between the two bacteria, and promote their adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells  <cit> . furthermore, the tplrr of the t. forsythensis bspa protein was shown to trigger an innate immune response by inducing il- <dig> secretion in epithelial cells via toll-like receptor  <dig>  and tlr <dig> signalling  <cit> . the bspa protein was also shown to elicit a strong antibody responses in t. forsythensis infected patients  <cit> . hence, tvbspa proteins could play similar roles and mediate important interactions with mucosal features including its microflora and host cells and proteins. the availability of one t. vaginalis genome sequence  <cit> , ~ <dig>  est from several different growth conditions and  <dig> distinct tvbspa genes spotted on microarrays gave us the opportunity to investigate the tvbspa genome complement and perform a first exploration of their corresponding transcripts to gain further insight into their potential importance in host-pathogen interactions. here, we present an updated survey of genomes encoding bspa-like proteins and the first detailed bioinformatic characterisations of tvbspa genomic distribution and exceptional structural diversity. we demonstrated differential expression at the transcript level of selected tvbspa genes upon t. vaginalis binding to ecm proteins or exposed to different iron concentration; and tvbspa <dig> cell surface expression and host antibody response during infection. together these data strongly indicate that tvbspa proteins are likely to play several important and distinct roles in t. vaginalis pathobiology and provide the fundamental data for future tvbspa genes and proteins comparison between various t. vaginalis clinical isolates and to initiate tvbspa proteins detailed functional characterisation.

RESULTS
the t. vaginalis genome encodes an exceptionally large putative bspa-like protein family
a combination of different protein blast searches identified a total of  <dig> distinct tvbspa candidate proteins in the t. vaginalis current genome annotation . reciprocal blastp searches with each individual candidate tvbspa confirmed their annotation as bspa-like proteins with top hits being tvbspa proteins  or bspa-like proteins from other taxa . of these  <dig> hypothetical proteins,  <dig> were positive for a tplrr profile,  <dig> were positive for the tplrr pattern and  <dig> positive for either . for  <dig> tvbspa entries their tplrr diverged to the extent that they are neither recognized by the tplrr profile nor pattern but all recovered other tvbspa or prokaryotic bspa-like proteins as their top blastp hits , hence we defined these as tvbspa entries with divergent tplrr. in several cases the divergent tvbspa are clearly related to subfamily members that are positive for the tplrr profile/pattern , with some examples listed in table  <dig>  these analyses expand by ~ <dig> entries the size of the tvbspa protein family identified based on blastp searches only  <cit> . notably, all identified tvbspa are clearly differentiated from t. vaginalis proteins with alternative lrr , none of which where hit by either the wu-blast or the phi-/psi-blast search that identified the  <dig> tvbspa entries.

eentries with inferred transmembrane domains  are indicated with the shown start and end position of the tmd. all such entries had the n-termini with the tplrr domain inferred to be "external" by two or more tmd predictors .

ftvag_ <dig> has an inferred signal peptide . the five entries from subfamily # <dig> with a tmd all share a similar cytoplasmic tail - see figure  <dig> 

only one tvbspa gene is annotated to possess two exons and  <dig> entries are annotated as pseudogenes due to stop codons or frame shifts interrupting the inferred orf . eight tvbspa putative proteins do not possess a starting methionine and three of these are very similar to longer proteins with a starting methionine. there were also  <dig> tvbspa genes with some ambiguous sequencing data . in addition, a total of  <dig> tvbspa proteins were derived from orf that start or end at the extremity of a scaffold suggesting they represent partial sequences, two of which have est support . hence a total of  <dig> tvbspa orf correspond to either mis-annotated, error-containing sequences, derived from genes with overlooked introns, pseudogenes, gene fragments, partially sequenced genes, or have sequencing errors/ambiguities. we focused our more detailed analyses on tvbspa protein sequences most likely derived from full-length genes based on their sequence features, genome context and evidence for transcription.

to allow comparisons of tvbspa protein sequence features and to provide estimates of their phylogenetic relationships, protein alignments and protein subfamilies were computed. these data were used to rationalise the vast structural diversity of the tvbspa proteins and contextualise their genomic organization. two multi alignments of tvbspa proteins were generated to allow their comparisons:  all  <dig> sequences  and  all  <dig> proteins with transmembrane domains  and inferred c-terminal cytoplasmic tails  . the order of the sequences in the alignment is a reflection of their relatedness with the most similar sequences typically being aligned next to each other and the more divergent sequences overall tend to be aligned last during the alignment estimation and these are located towards the bottom of the alignment  <cit>  . the position of the tvbspa sequences in the two alignments were contrasted with tvbspa protein subfamilies derived from an alignment-free clustering algorithm designed to deal, to some extent, with hard to cluster  repeat containing proteins  <cit> . a total of  <dig> subfamilies were identified for the  <dig> tvbspa . in numerous cases there was a good agreement between the subfamilies membership and their juxtaposed position in the alignments .

due to the highly repetitive nature of the t. vaginalis genome the current genome sequence data are fragmented over  <dig>  scaffolds  <cit> , consequently it was only possible to generate a partial picture of the genome organisation for the tvbspa gene family. the  <dig> tvbspa candidate genes were scattered over  <dig> scaffolds , with  <dig> scaffolds encoding one tvbspa and  <dig> scaffolds encoding two or more tvbspa  making up the majority and remaining  <dig> entries. many tvbspa genes are organised in clusters either in tandem repeats, or in close proximity to each other, with the largest cluster made of  <dig> tvbspa genes  over a genomic segment of  <dig>  kbp . some of the clustered genes encoded proteins highly similar to each other and are also recovered in the same protein subfamily and/or were aligned beside each other in the global  alignment . such patterns suggest local gene duplications generating tandem repeats  <cit> . we also identified in several cases closely related paralogues , which were encoded by genes present on different scaffolds, reminiscent of ectopic duplications events  <cit> .

the extensive size of the tvbspa gene family is currently unparalleled. the combined phi- and psi-blast searches that recovered  <dig> t. vaginalis proteins recovered one to  <dig> bspa-like sequences in  <dig> additional refseq annotated genomes . the next largest bspa-like gene families were found in entamoeba dispar  and entamoeba histolytica , the only other eukaryotic genomes, with t. vaginalis, currently known to encode proteins with tplrr  <cit>  . in contrast, prokaryotes encoded fewer bspa-like genes  but their taxonomic diversity was much broader including five archaeal species and  <dig> bacterial species/strains, with the majority of bacterial taxa being members of firmicutes  or the bacteroidetes  .

structural diversity of tvbspa proteins
although some tvbspa proteins are structurally very similar to each other, the tvbspa protein family overall is characterised by important variations in length and sequence of their tplrr and other sequence features when present, including other tandem repeats or low complexity segments, tmd and ct . the start and end positions of the tplrr of each tvbspa proteins were compared to investigate their length and contextual position with other sequence features . the tvbspa protein lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> residues  with the tplrr representing overall the major contributor to protein length  with the tplrr length correlating well with protein overall length . for the  <dig> tvbspa proteins with a tmd and cct  the contribution of the tplrr to total protein length is overall reduced  and more scattered due to the contribution of the tmd, ct and linker sequences between the tmd and the tplrr  . the tplrr-tmd linker sequences for  <dig> tvbspa with tmd-cct were characterised by additional repetitive or low complexity segments often enriched in proline or serine residues . a few cases of tvbspa proteins were inferred to possess distinctive domains identified by visual inspection of their alignments  or through an interproscan search .

tplrr containing proteins are thought to be extracellular either as surface exposed or secreted proteins  <cit> . notably, t. vaginalis encodes none of the enzymes required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchors synthesis and mediating their anchoring to proteins  <cit> , hence we focused our more detailed sequence analyses on entries with potential signal peptides , tmds or conserved features located towards the c-terminal end in the absence of evidence for tmd . the  <dig> entries with tmd-cct  have an inferred membrane topology implying that the entire tplrr would be exposed to the extracellular milieu if these were to be expressed on the cell surface. of these  <dig> tvbspa-tmd-cct entries  <dig> also had an inferred sp, defining type i membrane proteins and the  <dig> entries with no inferred sp defined potential membrane proteins of type iii  <cit> . among the  <dig> tvbspa proteins that were considered not to possess tmd,  <dig> had a detectable sp  and several of these also formed co-aligned subfamilies characterised by conserved c-termini often ending with hydrophobic residues and possessing conserved cysteines and other residues within motifs located ~20- <dig> residues from the c-terminus .

to initiate the rationalisation of the potential functional significance of the considerable tvbspa protein family, we further investigated their structural diversity and gene expression at the transcript level in different in vitro culture conditions. selected tvbspa proteins with notable sequence features or included in large subfamilies were also investigated in more details. our bioinformatic analyses also included the identification of repetitive sequences  that are often linked with surface proteins important for host-pathogen interactions in many pathogenic bacteria and microbial eukaryotes and are directly implicated in virulence and pathogenicity, including adhesion to host tissues and immune evasion  <cit> .

the first investigated tvbspa protein sequence, tvbspa <dig>  <cit>   was recovered among the nine sequences of subfamily # <dig>  tvbspa <dig>   was the most similar to tvbspa <dig>  when compared to other members of subfamily # <dig> . the two sequences share a tplrr-tmd linker segment made of proline and asparagines-rich repeats   and they are encoded on different scaffolds and separated by at least  <dig> kbp  if not located on different chromosomes. variations in the number of tplrr and the p/nrr between tvbspa <dig> and tvbspa <dig> indicate differential contractions and expansions of these repetitive segments between the two paralogues . the variations in repetitive sequences of proteins from microbial pathogens are an important source of genetic variations between species/isolate/strains and are thought to correspond to dynamic adaptive responses in host-pathogen interactions . hence we pcr cloned a 3'end segment of the tvbspa <dig> gene from the clinical isolate ss- <dig>  <cit>  that encompasses the p/nrr, tmd and ct to compare it with the corresponding g <dig> sequence . although the tvbspa <dig> protein sequences of isolate g <dig> and c-1:nih were identical  the amplicon of isolate ss- <dig> was slightly smaller compared to the control amplicon obtained from isolate g <dig> . sequencing revealed that this difference was due to a reduced number of enp qpg repeats  with five fewer repeats in isolate ss- <dig>  . for reason we currently don't understand, several attempts to pcr clone the entire tvbspa <dig> orf from strain ss- <dig> failed using both genomic dna and cdna as template. as the entire tvbspa <dig> orf could be amplified and sequenced from isolate g <dig> genomic dna in control pcr this suggests differences in the 5'end of the tvbspa <dig> gene between the two clinical isolates and together with the differences in p/nrr indicate that this gene readily accumulate changes between clinical isolates. all members of subfamily # <dig> did also co-align in the global tvbspa alignment with one intercalated aligned sequence not included in subfamily # <dig> . four members of subfamily # <dig> possess a tmd-cct. in addition to tvbspa <dig> and tvbspa <dig>  tvbspa <dig>  was also characterised by a prr in the tplrr-tmd linker  .

two highly similar paralogues tvbspa <dig> and tvbspa <dig>  were characterised by tplrr-tmd linker sequences with serine-rich repeats . the length variation between the two proteins was essentially restricted to the srr  reminiscent of the variation identified between tvbspa <dig> p/nrr from two clinical isolates .

inspecting the alignment of the  <dig> tvbspa with tmd-cct identified several related sequences  based on shared ct sequences. the largest group was made of  <dig> sequences sharing related tmds and a cts ending with the pattern fg and most of these also possessed the dileucine-like motif dxxxll known to function as sorting signals for rapid endocytosis and lysosomal targeting in other eukaryotes  <cit>  . the next largest group with a shared tmd-cct was made of  <dig> proteins sharing the motifs d fa and the minimal npxy-like signal  for rapid endocytosis  <cit>  .

among the  <dig> sequences with reduced contribution of the tplrr  to overall protein length ,  <dig> were characterised by distinct glycine-rich domains  located at the n-terminus, followed by the tplrr of various lengths . these  <dig> tvbspa-grd proteins were the exclusive members of subfamily # <dig>  six tvbspa-grd proteins were encoded by two gene clusters . the  <dig> tvbspa-grd proteins were co-aligned together indicating relatively recent gene duplication events, which in two cases corresponded to local duplications. blastp searches with the grd domain from the tvbspa-grd proteins as query recovered  <dig> none-trichomonas sequences in refseq, all annotated as hypothetical proteins and encoded by a taxonomically very restricted set of only nine genomes . the blast hit list also included additional t. vaginalis sequences without tplrr , these were not further investigated here. visual inspection of the grd alignment indicated that the different grds are likely to be homologous to each other with conserved positions including residues beyond the shared glycines . one tvbspa-grd member possessed a tmd and four entries without tmd possessed a potential sp, as did the protein from flavobacteirum bacteria  suggesting that these could be expressed on the surface or secreted. the four tvbspa-grd with an inferred sp corresponded to proteins with an n-terminal extension that is shared between a total of nine tvbspa-grd , suggesting that all the sequences with an extension could possess functional sp with some currently not recognized as such by signalp or phobius . three tvbspa-grd did not possess such extension, as did the proteins from c. difficile and the phages .

athe values for the top blastp hits  only are shown. the complete taxonomic report listing all hits is given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the taxa are listed by decreasing bit scores. the shown values for t. vaginalis correspond to the non-self top hit, entry tvag_ <dig> 

bthe values give the number of hits per genome. the  <dig> tvbspa possessing the grd were hit and include the query sequence. there is an additional  <dig> t. vaginalis proteins that possess a related grd that do not possess tplrr.

evidence for tvbspa genes transcription
to investigate tvbspa genes transcription we explored three sources of data including est, semi-quantitative rt-pcr and microarrays with quantitative rt-pcr  . a total of  <dig> tvbspa genes  had hits on one ore more est, with the majority having only one hit , with approximately the same proportion of tvbspa without and with tmd  having est support indicating that both structural types are transcribed and likely to be functional . different est libraries derived from five different culture conditions were characterised by little redundancy and overlap in terms of their tvbspa transcripts suggesting differential expression of the tvbspa genes for the compared growth conditions .

a total of  <dig> different tvbspa cdna were spotted on microarrays among a total of  <dig> distinct genes and these were used to contrast transcripts concentration in t. vaginalis cultures exposed to high and low iron concentration, as iron is an important factor known to influence the expression level of many genes , the virulence, morphology and growth of the parasite  <cit> . a total of  <dig> tvbspa genes showed significant variation in their mrna concentration between the tested conditions  and the remaining  <dig> entries showed expression but without significant differences between the tested conditions . for three tvbspa genes the modulations of transcript concentration was confirmed by qrt-pcr .

cpositive values indicate up-regulated genes and negative values down-regulated genes. all values are derived from quadruplets with indicated mean value  and significance  of modulation.

dqrt-pcr was performed in quadruplets with indicated mean and standard deviations.

semi-quantitative rt-pcr was also used to contrast the mrna concentration of nine tvbspa genes upon binding of t. vaginalis cells to ecm proteins, which is also known to influence the parasite morphology and gene expression  <cit> . we selected nine tvbspa genes encoding proteins with tmd based on their sequence features including tvbspa <dig> and tvbspa <dig>  and seven additional entries including two tvbspa with divergent tplrr . marked differences of expression patterns were observed among the analysed genes with one showing no expression in both tested conditions and five showing an obvious increase in their mrna concentration upon binding to ecm proteins . notable was the striking difference between the two similar paralogues  tvbspa <dig>  and tvbspa <dig>  .

consistent with these differences in pattern of expression for the tested conditions, marked differences in the upstream sequences to the tvbspa start codon could be observed, suggesting different promoters for each gene potentially mediating differential transcriptional regulation . the majority of tvbspa genes possessed known t. vaginalis core promoter elements including an initiator   or tata-boxes only  with  <dig> genes possessing neither . interestingly there was no significant difference in the proportion of tvbspa genes with est or without est among entries positive  or negative  for inr/tata-box suggesting that other core promoter elements for transcription exist in tvbspa genes. it will be interesting to investigate promoter sequence features for tvbspa and other protein coding genes when global tanscriptomics data will be generated for t. vaginalis.

cellular localization of tvbspa <dig> and its expression during infection
in order to investigate the expression and cellular localization of one tvbspa-like candidate surface protein four synthetic peptides were produced derived from the tvbspa <dig> sequence  and used to raise mouse antisera. three peptides are likely to generate antisera specific for tvbspa <dig>  whereas the fourth could possibly lead to antibodies cross-reacting with the paralogues tvbsp <dig>  . western blot analyses on t. vaginalis total protein extracts with the mouse antisera raised against one of the cytoplasmic located peptides  recognized a consistent major protein with an apparent molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda for both isolate g <dig> and ss- <dig>  while all presera did not detect any material . however, the other antisera did not identify the same material and were often characterised by more complex banding patterns  or had a distinct major band ~ <dig> kda . since the pre-sera did not detect any proteins and the apparent molecular masses of the proteins detected by the different antisera did not match the theoretical one for tvbspa <dig>  from the g <dig> isolate  the lower apparent molecular mass could be explained by aberrant gel migration  or represent proteolytic fragments. as we currently don't know the corresponding genome sequence for isolate ss- <dig> it is difficult to interpret the observed differences between the two isolates.

indirect immunofluorescence analyses  with confocal microscopy demonstrated a clear cell surface localization for the tvbspa <dig> protein for three out of four mouse antisera with either ethanol fixed cells  or formaldehyde fixed cells . in contrast one antisera  generated a strong signal over most of many cells, making cellular localization inference more difficult . mouse presera from the corresponding anti-peptide antisera generated no signal and both the hydrogenosomal malic enzyme  and tubulin  controls had clear intracellular localizations as expected . in formaldehyde fixed cells we could also observe an intracellular punctuate labelling, typically at the proximity of the cell surface, with anti-ct- <dig> and ext- <dig> antisera, whereas the anti-ct- <dig> antisera resulted in mainly a cell surface signal .

to investigate whether the cell surface tvbspa <dig> protein is expressed during infection we measured the presence of antibody recognizing the four peptides  in sera from patients infected by t. vaginalis and contrasted these to control sera from t. vaginalis negative patients . all four peptides were recognised by similar proportion of patients sera  from tested patients  with 85% of these patients recognizing two or more peptides and 88% at least one peptide . sera from t. vaginalis positive patients were significantly  more frequently recognizing one or more peptides in the elisa assay when compared to controls patients . the pool of t. vaginalis positive patients was also significantly more frequently hiv positive compared to the pool of t. vaginalis negative patients  , as is now well recognised  <cit> .

aa total of  <dig> patients with sera positive for t. vaginalis total protein extracts were contrasted to  <dig> patients with sera negative for t. vaginalis total protein extracts. fractions of respective samples are indicated . the proportion of hiv positive sera from the same set of patients was also compared. sets of values used for statistical test and calculation of respective % are indicated by * or **.

discussion
initial analyses of the draft genome sequence of t. vaginalis  identified a plethora of candidate surface/secreted proteins among which the largest family was made of the tvbspa proteins with over  <dig> entries that share a type of lrr  <cit> . here we describe additional tvbspa candidate proteins further extending the size of this considerable protein family and the first detailed analyses of the sequence structural diversity of all  <dig> tvbspa candidate proteins. we also investigated selected tvbspa transcripts from parasites grown in different conditions and provide for one tvbspa protein the first cellular localisation data as well as identify sequence variations between clinical isolates and patients antibody responses during t. vaginalis infection.

tvbspa gene family tremendous diversity and origins
more comprehensive protein searches of the annotated t. vaginalis draft genome, made more sensitive and specific by combining pattern and profile based searches for tplrr containing proteins, extended the tvbspa gene family by over  <dig> to a total of  <dig> entries. searching the refseq protein database for bspa-like proteins with the same search strategy identified a taxonomically divers set of organisms, including two additional eukaryotes  and a great majority  of species derived from two major bacterial lineages, firmicutes  and bacteroidetes . interestingly, firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the most prevalent taxa identified by gene surveys in the gut of vertebrates, including humans  <cit> . indeed, the great majority of taxa encoding bspa-like proteins, including the three eukaryotes, are known to share the capacity to thrive on mucosal surfaces either as pathogens, commensals or mutualists . these data clearly reinforced earlier observations, made on a much more restricted set of sequenced genomes  <cit> , that bspa-like proteins are preferentially encoded by mucosal microbes.

this pattern strengthened the hypotheses that lateral gene transfers  of bspa-like genes between microorganisms thriving on mucosal surfaces took place  <cit>  and that bspa-like proteins are involved in important aspects of microbes-mucosa interactions. mucosal surfaces; which include the colon, the niche with the highest known density of microbes  <cit> ; harbour a large diversity of cellular microbes  between which lgt could take place, a mechanism thought to contribute to adaptations to a mucosal life style  <cit> . as the taxonomic diversity of genomes encoding bspa-like proteins is higher among prokaryotes we suggest that the only three eukaryotes  currently known to encode bspa-like proteins acquired the corresponding genes from prokaryotic donors, likely bacterial species. the three tvbspa proteins with the highest level of sequence identity in blastp alignments with prokaryotic proteins are with the firmicute eubacterium siraeum  and the bacteroidetes tannerella forsythia  . interestingly a bias was observed among candidate lgt genes identified in t. vaginalis with firmicutes and bacteroridetes being the most common identifiable candidate donors as supported by detailed phylogenetics   <cit> . the extensive eukaryotic bspa-like gene families , compared with the much restricted gene families found in prokaryotes  could be explained by one or a few lgt acquisitions from prokaryotic donors followed by large numbers of gene duplication events within the eukaryotic genomes, so called "conservative" gene duplications that are thought  to contribute to an organism adaptations to its environment  <cit> . alternatively, the larger gene families observed in eukaryotes could be explained by several lgts followed by less dramatic sets of gene duplication events. we favour the former hypothesis as few eukaryotic bspa-like entries show higher scores with their prokaryotic counterparts  with the great majority  of individual tvbspa protein recovering as top blastp hits other tvbspa . trichomonas sequences are also rather distinct from the entamoeba sequences both in terms of their tplrr and overall structural organisation, consistent with independent gene acquisition and amelioration  programs - only  <dig> tvbspa proteins have entamoeba entries  as top blast hit .

contrasting tvbspa gene positions on scaffolds with a tvbspa global alignment and subfamily composition  of the corresponding proteins indicated that both tandem and ectopic gene duplications events took place, as discussed for the large disease resistance gene family encoding proteins with lrr in plants  <cit> . the largest gene cluster made of  <dig> tvbspa genes was generated by a combination of a few ectopic and several tandem duplication events. more detailed information on the genome distribution of the tvbspa genes, for instance their potential locations in subtelomeric regions as known for important surface variant proteins in other pathogenic microbial eukaryotes  <cit> , will await more extensive clustering of the > <dig>  scaffolds and their mapping onto chromosomes  <cit> .

tvbspa protein structural diversity
following gene duplications, tvbspa paralogues differentiated dramatically. this diversity was identified in both the sequence and number of the tplrr with extensive overall length variation between tvbspa proteins from less then  <dig> to over  <dig> residues. the compression and/or extensions of the tplrr segments contributed to most of the observed length diversity but variation of other type of sequences are also involved including non-lrr repeats, tmd and ct, indicating an evolutionary highly dynamic gene family and suggesting that these proteins play several distinct functions. as tvbspa proteins are characterised by tplrr typically present on extracellular proteins in other taxa  <cit> , and additional repeats are also present in several cases, they are potentially involved in various aspects of host-pathogen interactions as shown for many repeat containing proteins including lrr  <cit> . a total of  <dig> tvbspa were inferred to possess tmd and cct, supporting the hypothesis that the n-terminal ends of the proteins, including the tplrr, face the extracellular milieu if expressed on the cell surface. potential sps were also detected for tvbspa with and without tmd. for proteins without tmd and with sp this suggests that these could be secreted or bound to the cell surface with unknown anchors - as there are no gpi-anchors in t. vaginalis  <cit> . notably the current complete absence of experimental data for t. vaginalis sp probably contributes to underestimating the number of sp positive tvbspa entries in silico as signalp <dig>  and phobius were trained with a restricted diversity of eukaryotes  <cit> . entries genuinely without sp and tmd could be secreted or anchored to the cell surface through unknown mechanisms or could represent non-functional proteins, perhaps corresponding to pseudogenes, although est suggest that all types of tvbspa proteins are transcribed and could be functional. several tvbspa without tmd  were also characterised by conserved c-terminal ends, including motifs with conserved cysteines and other residues and in some cases were ending with hydrophobic residues. such conserved c-terminal motifs could be implicated in anchoring tvbspa proteins via unknown lipids . such motifs included the sequences ck in members of subfamilies # <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  schia for some members of subfamilies # <dig> and  <dig> or tcqcr in subfamily # <dig> . these tvbspa c-termini could be modified by hypothetical and 'atypical' lipid anchors for a eukaryotic surface exposed protein, as shown, or hypothesized, for some surface proteins from e. histolytica  <cit>  including ehbspa proteins  <cit> . in the case of several ehbspa, the cysteine of a c-terminal caax motif  could be implicated and one caax containing ehbspa protein was indeed demonstrated to be expressed on the cell surface  <cit> . none of the tvbspa possessed a c-terminal caax box.

the important sequence variation observed between the tvbspa paralogues contrast dramatically with the high level of sequence conservation observed among copies of the highly repetitive genes made of virus-like, transposable elements  and unclassified gene families, with a  <dig> % average pairwise difference for an average gene copy number of  <dig>  identified in t. vaginalis g <dig> genome . this suggests that the tvbspa genes are under some level of positive selective pressure whereas the virus-like, te and unclassified highly repetitive genes families are evolving neutrally, as would be expected for proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions  and selfish genes, respectively. it will be of great interest to contrast the level of selection pressure  on tvbspa genes and contrast these with other genes across several t. vaginalis isolate and one or more closely related species - required to generate dna alignments of orf to calculate ω values, the more sequences the better for tests measuring selection - e.g.  <cit> .

one tvbspa subfamily was characterised by a shared n-terminal grd followed by the tplrr. blastp searches with the grd from tvbspa-grd identified hypothetical proteins encoded by a very restricted set of genomes including t. vaginalis, flavobacteria bacterium, four strains of clostridium difficile, two c. difficile phages and bacillus cereus. these data defined a new protein domain of unknown function that is shared between proteins with distinct c-termini currently encoded by few and distantly related taxa, t. vaginalis , f. bacterium , c. difficile and b. cereus , and two c. difficile phages, with all cellular organisms sharing the capacity to be potentially pathogenic to human mucosa. clostridium difficile is the most common source of nosocomial diarrhea  <cit>  and f. bacterium and b. cereus are commonly found in soil and water systems with b. cereus being a common opportunistic pathogen also causing pathologies in the digestive tract  <cit> . members of the flavobacteria are often pathogens  or opportunistic pathogens, including in humans  <cit> . this highly restricted and biased taxonomic distribution among specialised mucosal pathogens and potential opportunist mucosal pathogens is intriguing. in addition many prophages encode toxins and other virulent factors in pathogenic bacteria  <cit>  and the phage grd containing protein  is located beside of the holin protein, which is part of the cell lysis casset, and that corresponds to one of the preferential locations of toxins encoded by lambda-like prophages as know for the shiga toxin in subsets of e. coli strains  <cit> . indeed, the two grd containg proteins in the complete genome of c. difficile  <dig> are encoded by genes  with the same location  within the two highly conserved prophages identified during annotation <cit> . holin is also homologous to the tcde gene of the c. difficile pathogenicity locus harbouring the five genes tcdabcde that is known to regulate the expression of the c. difficile toxins tcda and tcdb  <cit> . taken together, these different considerations suggest that proteins containing the newly identified grd could be involved in some aspects of t. vaginalis-host interactions possibly by contributing to damaging bacteria of the vaginal microflora or human cells. it will be of interest to directly test this hypothesis experimentally with both t. vaginalis and c. difficile grd-containing proteins.

among relatively recently duplicated tvbspa genes  we identified cases where paralogues accumulated differences in both the number of tplrr and/or other repetitive sequences as often observed for proteins known to be involved in host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . such variations in repetitive segments were also identified between tvbspa <dig> from two clinical isolates, with isolate ss- <dig> possessing a shorter p/nrr in the tplrr-tmd linker sequence when compared to tvbspa <dig> from isolate g <dig>  the incapacity to pcr clone the entire tvbspa <dig> orf from isolate ss- <dig> also suggested variations at the 5'end of the gene corresponding to the tplrr domain. western blot analyses did detect the same major band with the anti-ct- <dig> antisera but identified some differences with the other antisera  and sequencing of the full tvbspa <dig> holomologue of isolate ss- <dig> will be required to try to rationalise these results. taken together these data demonstrated that tvbspa paralogues within a given genome and orthologues between clinical isolates readily accumulate changes in repetitive sequences as would be expected for proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions and possibly under selection pressures such as in the case of host immune responses directed against them  <cit> . in addition variations in repetitive sequence of surface proteins can also lead to important quantitative alterations of their functions, such as variation of adhesion properties to substrates as in cell-cell adhesions during parasite swarming  with dramatic cases described in yeast involving surface proteins with different type of tandem repeats  <cit> . variants in tplrr could also lead to different functions altogether , and possibly contribute to rapid adaptations to environmental changes  as known, or suggested, for different parasitic and other microbial eukaryotes  <cit> . it will be particularly interesting to compare in the future the extent of global variations of tvbspa tplrr and non-lrr repeats between various clinical isolates to gain a better insight into their potential roles in evading host immune response and possible link between t. vaginalis genetic diversity and virulence  <cit> . as such, tvbspa-like genes could represent valuable markers for epidemiological studies to type clinical isolates  <cit> .

another interesting aspect of the diversity among tvbspa proteins with tmd was identified in two subfamilies with conserved ct. each subfamily was characterised with a classic sorting signals in their ct with one possessing a di-leucine-like signal and the other an npxy-like signal, both known to mediate rapid endocytosis in other eukaryotes  <cit> . in both cases the sequence and their position in the cytoplasmic tails suggested that these are functional  <cit> . the npxy containing sequences in particular were characterised by flanking sequences fdnp f  known to form potent signals for endocytosis further supporting their functionality  <cit> . hence these tvbspa proteins could represent receptors mediating endocytosis of various host  proteins with their tplrr likely involved in binding to ligands. these tvbspa proteins represent to our knowledge the first candidate receptor potentially mediating endocytosis of various host or other proteins.

some tvbspa genes are potential pseudogenes with  <dig> entries currently being annotated as such as they possess orf disrupting sequence features. in addition, other tvbspa sequences have sequencing ambiguities or are obviously truncated due to sequencing problems or missing data. however, very little is currently known about the structure-function relationship for tvbspa proteins and some of these annotated pseudogenes could actually correspond to functional genes such as tvag_ <dig>  which correspond to a c-terminal truncated form compared to a longer tvbspa-grd. hence some 'pseudogenes' could actually encode functional proteins  or correspond to a reservoir used to generate tvbspa diversity through recombination or other processes facilitating the creation of new functional genes distinct from existing ones  <cit> .

evidence for expression
for a total of over  <dig> tvbspa entries  we obtained evidence for transcription through est, rt-pcr and microarray analyses. differential expression was suggested from est surveys and demonstrated for a subset of genes by microarray and rt-pcr analyses for two conditions, change in iron concentration and binding of parasite to ecm proteins, consistent with different functions for the analysed tvbspa. due to the large gene family size a global approach based on microarrays designed to cover all  <dig> tvbspa genes combined with testing key stages of t. vaginalis infections of the urogenital tract of both sexes will be required in the future to gain further insight into the functional relevance of the vast tvbspa gene family. the microarray data presented here indicate that this approach will be an important one to contrast transcripts abundance.

the use of antisera directed against peptide derived from the tvbspa <dig> sequence demonstrated by ifa the expression of the proteins and its cell surface location, consistent with the bioinformatics analyses, indicating that the tplrr and the p/nrr of tvbspa <dig> are exposed to extracellular milieu where they could mediate binding to host or other proteins as demonstrated for the bacterial proteins bspa and lrra  <cit> .

the same peptides used to raise the mouse anti-tvbspa <dig> antisera were also used in elisa assays to test the presence of antibodies recognizing tvbspa <dig> from clinical patients. our data strongly suggest that this protein is indeed expressed and triggers antibody responses in both sexes during the majority of tested t. vaginalis infections. variations of the length of the p/nrr of tvbspa <dig> also suggested that the protein is under selective pressure possibly due to the immune response it stimulates. contrasting the tvbspa <dig> sequences and their expression  between additional t. vaginalis clinical isolates from patients with and without an antibody response to this protein would be particularly interesting to further test this possibility. the patients without detected antibodies directed against tvbspa <dig>  could correspond to t. vaginalis isolates that don't express that protein at all or with differences in the epitopes tested here. from these different considerations, we predict that differential expression of tvbspa gene sets combined with differences in the tplrr and other repeats between tvbspa proteins will be identified between different clinical isolates.

finally tvbspa could play important roles in regulating the innate immune responses in the urogential tracts, as demonstrated in vitro for t. vaginalis total cell surface proteins  <cit> , since the bspa protein from t. forsythia was shown to regulate in a cd <dig> and tlr <dig> dependent manner cytokine induction  <cit> . the tplrr of some tvbspa could be directly involved in binding the lrr of tlrs and induce specific innate response signalling.

CONCLUSIONS
considering the phenotypes of organisms encoding bspa-like proteins, the majority being pathogens, commensal or mutualists thriving on vertebrate mucosal surfaces; the established function of bspa-like proteins in the pathogenicity of two mouth mucosal bacteria ; the extraordinarily large tvbspa protein family size with its vast structural diversity, the differential expression patterns demonstrated for some tvbspa genes and the cell surface expression and induction of an antibody response during infections for one tvbspa protein; together strongly suggest that the tvbspa proteins play various and important roles in t. vaginalis' pathobiology by contributing to the invasion and long term infections of the human urogenital tract. tvbspa-like proteins represent strong candidate surface proteins mediating interaction with various mucosal landmarks including the mucus; vec, urethra epithelial cell and other host cells; ecm proteins and vaginal microflora or cell-cell adhesion during parasite swarming. tvbspa could also mediate endocytosis of various host proteins and viruses, as well as underpin phagocytosis of bacteria and various host cells. finally tvbspa proteins could orchestrate the modulation of the innate immune system through tlrs signalling during infection and mediate immune evasion through differential expression.
