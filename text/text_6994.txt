BACKGROUND
domain shuffling in modular proteins is considered one of the major sources of evolutionary innovation  <cit> . phylogenetic studies of signaling and regulatory proteins exhibiting variable domain composition can provide important contributions towards understanding the basis of the current diversity of life.

formins  may serve as a good example of an ancient protein family with a likely role in morphogenesis  whose evolution included extensive domain rearrangements. the well-conserved fh <dig>  domain  can nucleate new actin filaments by a unique „leaky barbed-end cap“ mechanism, and in some situations acts as a capping protein . besides fh <dig>  most formins possess a n-terminally located proline-rich region , implicated in interactions with the actin monomer-binding protein profilin. some formins also share additional  domains that vary substantially between diverse eukaryotic lineages.

metazoan formins often contain a n-terminal gtpase binding domain  interacting with rho class gtpases. gbd usually overlaps with another conserved domain, fh <dig> , and the gbd/fh <dig> motif is recognized by a c-terminally located autoinhibitory domain . this domain architecture, which is believed to mediate control of the formin's actin-nucleating activity by rho-related gtpases  <cit> , was originally considered characteristic for metazoan diaphanous-related formins but later found to be widespread, though not ubiquitous, not only in metazoans, but also in fungi and dictyostelium  <cit> .

fh2-containing proteins tend to form extensive families of paralogs , and their overall domain organization is often variable within the repertoire encoded by any given genome. nevertheless, certain domain arrangements are more frequent, present in multiple species of a given taxon, and therefore probably ancestral. this is apparently also the case of the gbd/fh3-fh1-fh2-dad architecture.

however, no gbd/fh3-containing formins have been identified in plants so far. formins from angiosperms can be unequivocally assigned to one out of two classes, based on primary structure of their fh <dig> domains  <cit> ; none of them is orthologous to any of the proposed seven metazoan formin classes  <cit> , or to fungal formins.

each angiosperm formin class exhibits also a characteristic domain composition. the „prototype“ structure for plant class i formins includes a n-terminal membrane insertion signal, followed by a supposedly extracytoplasmic pro-rich stretch, a transmembrane region, and c-terminal fh <dig> and fh <dig> domains  <cit> . experimental studies confirmed membrane association for several class i formins in arabidopsis and suggested within-class functional differences reflected e.g. in varying tissue- or organ-specific expression patterns or in protein localization to specific subcellular destinations  <cit> . a novel mode of interaction with actin has been documented for a class i member, atfh <dig> from arabidopsis, which can induce formation of filament bundles in addition to formin nucleation  <cit> .

angiosperm class ii formins usually  carry a n-terminal domain related to members of another conserved protein family whose founding member is the human antioncogene pten, recently implied also in the pathogenesis of the parkinson disease . the conventional pten domain exhibits a phosphatase activity towards both lipids and proteins and is believed to mediate lipid-based signaling affecting e.g. actin organization, cytokinesis and development of cell surface structures in organisms as diverse as the human, drosophila and dictyostelium  <cit> . surprisingly, the phosphatase catalytic site is eroded by mutations in the pten-like domains of plant formins, suggesting that this domain may perhaps participate in localization of the fh <dig> domain rather than exhibiting its own catalytic activity  <cit> .

pten-related domains are found also in metazoan tensin , auxilins  and in the auxilin-like domain of the cyclin g-associated protein kinase  <cit> , indicating that the pten domain is, like fh <dig>  a versatile building block capable of entering into multiple contexts.

it is therefore not surprising that pten family proteins without any obvious relationship to the formins have been found also in plants. arabidopsis has three pten homologues, one of them  essential for the male gametophyte development  <cit> ; the phenotype of the non-viable mutant pollen suggests an involvement in cell surface organization.

systematic phylogenetic studies of the formin repertoire encoded by complete genomes have been so far restricted on one hand to the opisthokont lineage  and the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum  <cit>  which may be relatively close to opisthokonts  <cit> , or, on the other hand, to vascular plants, predominantly angiosperms  <cit> . thus, until now, we could not decide whether any of the opisthokont  formin architectures represents either a conserved ancestral state or a late invention. using the growing thesaurus of publicly available sequence data, we have attempted to map the formin diversity across five out of the six major eukaryotic kingdoms , with particular attention to plants. the results yielded a possible evolutionary scenario that may have produced the extant domain architecture of plant formins, and provided interesting insights into the evolutionary dynamics of modular regulatory proteins in general.

RESULTS
a collection of eukaryotic formin sequences
to obtain a broader view of the formin diversity, we scanned  <dig> available complete or nearly complete eukaryotic genome sequences, as well as est and cdna databases of additional eleven species, using known representatives of plant class i and class ii, metazoan and yeast formins as queries . as a result, we have assembled a collection of  <dig> plant formin sequences from  <dig> species , as well as  <dig> formins from  <dig> species of the metazoans, fungi, amoebae, chromalveolates and excavates . as expected, all complete genomes studied encoded at least one fh2-containing protein, supporting the notion that the fh <dig> domain belongs to a set of proteins present already in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. however, we were unable to find any possible prokaryotic relatives, i.e. bacterial or archeal proteins exhibiting significant similarity to the fh <dig> domain.

somewhat surprisingly, we have noticed that considerable expansion of the fh <dig> protein family is not restricted to multicellular organisms. in contrary, nearly all complete genomes analyzed  encoded at least two fh2-containing proteins, and even unicellular organisms such as the excavate naegleria gruberi  or the ciliate paramecium tetraurelia possess  <dig> or  <dig> formins, respectively – i.e. a number comparable to that reported previously for mammals  <cit>  or flowering plants  <cit> .

phylogeny of the fh <dig> domain: evidence for multiple independent gene duplications
the apparent widespread multiplication of formin-encoding genes in diverse lineages raises the question whether any of the extant formins can be assigned to well-defined groups of orthologues beyond those identified in previous phylogenetic studies  <cit> . we have thus constructed a detailed phylogenetic tree of the fh <dig> domains of nearly  <dig> formin sequences from our collection .

we have successfully recovered all the major previously reported formin groups, namely the  <dig> metazoan classes , a compact group of yeast  formins  <cit> , as well as plant class i and class ii formins  <cit> . noticeably, choanoflagellate  fh <dig> domains tend to cluster together with animal ones in most cases. three new clades containing fh <dig> domains of multiple organism have been recovered – namely two branches containing most  basidiomycete and zygomycete formins, a cluster containing the majority of ciliate formins, and a somewhat poorly supported cluster of adjacent branches containing exclusively stramenopile sequences . nevertheless, many of protist formins could not be assigned to any of the previously defined classes; and also some algal formins fell into the unresolved deep branches together with the majority of protist sequences. this could perhaps be at least partially due to erosion of meaningful phylogenetic signal by a build-up of mutations, and possibly also to long branch-associated artifacts.

on the contrary, topologies of some of the well-defined branches, in particular the plant class i and class ii formins where numerous sequences have been included in the analysis, as well as the fhod cluster, indicate a relatively low degree of within-class divergence that suggests recent diversification . it is thus likely that multiple duplications of formin-encoding genes took place independently in diverse lineages.

to our surprise, a third group of fh <dig> domains, possibly related to plant class i but distinct from them, was found in some non-seed plants, namely in the lycophyte selaginella moelendorffii, the moss physcomitrella patens and in two prasinophyte algae . since this group exhibits also a specific domain organization , we suggest recognizing these formins as a specific subgroup of plant fh2-containing proteins. we will further refer to these proteins as plant class iii formins.

diversity of formin domain architectures
while phylogenetic analysis based on fh <dig> domain sequences captures evolution driven by point mutations, it provides no information on domains outside fh <dig>  we have therefore searched all complete formin sequences for a collection of known protein domains from the smart and pfam databases using the smart search tool  <cit> . in addition, blast was used to search for homologues of the plant fh2-associated pten-like domain that is not included in the smart/pfam domain set  <cit> . results are summarized in table  <dig> , table  <dig>  and in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

an overview of conserved domains and motifs in non-plant fh <dig> proteins. for each group of organisms, presence or absence of conserved domains or motifs found in formins of at least two species is indicated ; for more detailed table including single-instance domains, a full list of species and numbers of genes see additional file  <dig>  domain abbreviations and accessions are: fh <dig> – formin homology  <dig> , gbd/fh <dig> – gtpase binding domain of diaphanous-related formins  and/or fh <dig> domain of diaphanous-related formins , dad – diaphanous autoinhibitory domain ; ph – pleckstrin homology domain , ank – ankyrin repeats , c <dig> – protein kinase c conserved region  <dig> , pdz – domain present in psd- <dig>  dlg, and zo-1/ <dig> ; pten – phosphatase and tensin homology domain , tm – a secretion signal/transmembrane helix combination.

an overview of conserved domains and motifs in plant  fh <dig> proteins. presence or absence of fh <dig> domains of the three plant-specific formin clades, as well as conserved domains or motifs found in formins of at least two species, are indicated. for a more detailed table including single-instance domains, a full list of species and numbers of genes see additional file  <dig>  rhogap – gtpase-activator protein for rho-like gtpases ; for remaining domain abbreviations see table  <dig> 

the majority of fh <dig> proteins analyzed appears to contain a rather limited selection of additional domains outside fh <dig>  with the canonical gbd/fh3-fh1-fh <dig> set being the most frequent domain architecture. the c-terminal dad motif usually found in gbd/fh3-containing formins is defined very stringently in the pfam database, as it detects only a subset of proteins reported to contain it  and misses, e.g., all yeast and dictyostelium formins, as well as some mammalian ones. we will further refer to "gbd/fh3-fh1-fh2" architecture or "gbd/fh3-containing formins" in all cases where the presence of dad could not be documented by statistically significant detection of the pfam motif , reserving the full "gbd/fh3-fh1-fh2-dad" description to cases where this motif was found unambiguously. nevertheless, we believe that presence of gbd/fh <dig> is likely to indicate regulation by means of gtpase-dependent release of intramolecular inhibition via a canonical or variant dad that may be detected upon visual inspection  <cit>  and data not shown). gbd/fh3-containing formins have been found in representatives of all kingdoms with the exception of plants, although only in animals and fungi they were present in all species; this is consistent with this domain architecture being ancestral.

major eukaryotic lineages exhibit substantial differences in the degree of formin architecture diversity. fungi represent one extreme; indeed, all fungal formins studied exhibited the standard gbd/fh3-fh1-fh <dig> combination, and no other conserved domains were identified. on the other end of the scale are some chromalveolate lineages, in particular the stramenopiles, and, to a lesser extent, also the metazoa, which have combined the fh <dig> domain with a diverse array of other conserved modules. although such "exotic" formin structures have to be interpreted cautiously, since gene prediction artifacts cannot be excluded in the absence of experimentally determined cdna sequences, at least in one case , a protein containing fh <dig> in combination with a dna binding  domain exhibited biological activity.

some chromalveolate species, such as cryptosporidium parvum, thalassiosira pseudonana and phaeodactylum tricornutum, as well as the excavates leishmania major and trypanosoma sp., lack gbd/fh3-containing formins altogether. however, plants represent the only kingdom that appears to have entirely disposed of the canonical structure. instead, they possess up to three major groups of formins. besides the previously described class i  and class ii  formins characteristic for angiosperm plants  <cit> , we found that the novel class iii formins of some non-seed plant species carry a n-terminal domain homologous to the rho – associated gtpase activating protein . we will discuss this domain, which appears to be specific to plant class iii formins, in more detail below. a schematic view of some of the observed formin domain organizations is presented in figure  <dig> 

a novel rhogap-like domain in formins of non-seed plants
the novel, plant-specific combination of a class iii fh <dig> domain and a rhogap-related domain was found in four proteins: one from a lycophyte , one from a moss  and one each from two prasinophytes . another prasinophyte genome released after the submission of our manuscript  also appears to encode at least one class iii formin upon brief inspection . to our surprise, detailed examination of an alignment of the rhogap-related domain sequences revealed significant deviations from the common rhogap consensus, most notably replacement of the central arginine of the "arginine finger"  <cit>  which appears to be involved in gtpase activation by ras, rho and rab gaps, by a small aliphatic or polar residue. also a similarly conserved lysine residue downstream of the arginine finger appears to be replaced by leucine in all the plant sequences . a three-dimensional model of the rhogap-related domain constructed by threading of phypa <dig> on known rho or racgap domain structures  indeed confirmed a local alteration in shape and charge of the conserved gtpase interaction interface, while the overall conformation of the molecule appears preserved. thus, the rhogap-like domain of class iii thus might not function as a gtpase-activating protein, while its ability to bind a rho-class gtpase may be retained. nevertheless, since an alternative mechanism of gtpase activation involving an asparagine at a closely related position instead of the arginine finger has been described for rap1gap  <cit> , we cannot exclude that the gap domains of class iii formins also "invented" their own way of supporting gtpase activity.

identification of rhogap-related domains in class iii formins of prasinophytes and two early land plants  prompted us to search for closely related domains among the previously characterized members of the rhogap family. in phylogenetic trees based on a combination of class iii rhogap-domain sequences with a recently published set of human rhogaps  <cit> , the rhogap-like domains from class iii formins cluster together, however their relation to any of the human rhogaps cannot be resolved . a blast search of the non-redundant ncbi entrez database with the phypa <dig> rhogap domain as a query identifies predominantly metazoan , fungal and dictyostelium proteins with e-values in the range of  <dig> - <dig> to 10- <dig>  the only exception being ostta <dig>  the remaining rhogap-like domains of class iii formins find no significant matches by blast; however, they produce results analogous to phypa <dig> when the more sensitive psi-blast algorithm  <cit>  is used. we can thus conclude that the rhogap-like domains of class iii formins are more closely related to opisthokont rhogaps than to plant ropgaps.

pten-containing domains outside land plants
several of the observed domain architectures were found in formins of multiple distantly related lineages. if multiple instances are found within one kingdom , kingdom-specific acquisition followed by gene loss is the obvious explanation. however, some domains exhibit a discontinuous or punctate distribution across more than one kingdom. this is the case e.g. of the c <dig> domain , the ph domain , the pten domain , and the secretion signal – transmembrane segment combination . the first two domains occur in isolated instances, suggesting independent origins of the c2-fh <dig> and ph-fh <dig> combinations, while the small size and relatively loose sequence requirements for secretion and transmembrane signals points to possible convergent evolution. the case of pten is more complex, and deserves a detailed analysis.

the pten-related domain is characteristic for plant class ii formins, found in angiosperms, lycophytes and mosses. however, it was also identified in prasinophyte formins that cannot be reliably assigned to any of the three fh <dig> clades characteristic for land plants , as well as in formins of stramenopiles . the relationships between stramenopiles and plants may be somewhat suggestive of horizontal gene transfer associated with either endosymbiosis or parasitism , although this can be neither confirmed nor rejected on the basis of the fh <dig> domain sequence since the relationship of stramenopile fh <dig> to the plant formins remains unresolved.

to obtain insight into possible origins of discontinuous phylogenetic distribution of the pten-fh <dig> architecture, we have assembled a collection of  <dig> "standalone" pten domain sequences  from  <dig> species  and performed a phylogenetic analysis, including also  <dig> pten domains of the previously identified plant and stramenopile formins. after removing sequences whose inclusion would have introduced gaps that would lead to substantial shortening of the alignment, we obtained a tree , which exhibits a generally better statistic support than the fh <dig> domain tree and classifies the pten domains of prasinophyte formins as sister group of the pten domains of angiosperm class ii formins, while stramenopile fh2-associated pten domains form a separate clade. however, a tree based on a shorter alignment including more sequences  swaps the position of the prasinophyte and stramenopile fh2-associated pten domains; thus we have to consider their relationship to angiosperm class ii formins still unresolved. nevertheless, neither tree supports monophyletic ancestry of pten domains from prasinophyte and stramenopile formins, suggesting an independent origin of the pten-fh <dig> association rather than horizontal gene transfer.

independent acquisition of a pten-like domain in stramenopile formins is also supported by the finding that, similar to plant class ii formins  <cit> , the prasinophyte, but not stramenopile, formins lack a crucial arginine residue in the conserved catalytic site of the pten protein/lipid phosphatase  <cit>  and are thus unlikely to exhibit enzymatic activity. however, stramenopile formins have retained the canonical arginine residue . nevertheless, they also probably lost the catalytic activity, since they are missing another conserved residue , raising thus the possibility that stramenopiles not only independently invented the pten-fh <dig> domain architecture, but also found their own way to disable the enzyme activity of the pten domain.

discussion
formins  are an abundant family of actin-organizing proteins conserved across multiple major eukaryotic lineages. however, detailed phylogenetic analyses so far focused only on opisthokonts, dictyostelium and angiosperm plants  <cit> . while the results provided a glimpse of the extent of formin domain architecture variability, little was known until now about fh <dig> protein diversity outside these lineages. an attempt to trace down the origins of the conserved parts of the actin-nucleating machinery, including formins, failed to identify significant relatives of the conserved fh <dig> domain among prokaryotes. nevertheless, formins were found in all eukaryotes sampled so far , suggesting their presence already in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes  <cit> . in this study, we attempt to map the diversity of formins across most eukaryotic kingdoms, focusing not only on the fh <dig> domain itself but also on the overall domain architecture of the multi-domain fh2-containing proteins, and to reconstruct a possible evolutionary scenario that has produced the unique domain architectures found in formins of present-day plants.

the selection of species sampled was constrained mainly by public availability of searchable complete or draft genome sequences. we have included representatives of most major eukaryotic kingdoms  <cit> : animals , several lineages of fungi, amoebozoa, chromalveolates, excavates and a diverse selection of plants. we could not include any representative of the rhizaria because of lack of data. however, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that the rhizarians may, in fact, represent a branch of chromalveolates  <cit> , which would mean that our collection covers all major eukaryotic lineages.

since we focused on the origins of the domain architecture of plant formins, we sampled the plant lineage in more detail. our analysis covers three complete genomes and several cdna or est collections from angiosperms, one moss genome, five algal genomes representing the chlorophytes, prasinophytes and rhodophytes, and a partial genome sequence from a lycophyte. however, data are still lacking from many lineages that may be crucial for filling the gaps in our evolutionary reconstruction. in particular, gymnosperm sequences might aid in pinpointing the disappearance of class iii formins that are present in mosses and lycophytes but absent in angiosperms, charophyte data would probably help to resolve the events associated with acquisition of the class i  formin architecture characteristic for land plants, and glaucophyte data would provide insight into the early steps in the establishment of the plant lineage.

an initial database search revealed an astonishing diversity of formins in most eukaryotes. with the exception of some ascomycete fungi, all organisms studied have at least two formin-encoding genes, and the number exceeds a dozen in many lineages, including the unicellular flagellate amoeba naegleria. thus, the diversity of formins obviously does not reflect functional demands related to production of multiple cell types or complex cell-to-cell boundaries, as would be expected from observations of tissue-specific expression of some formins in metazoans  <cit>  or plants  <cit>  or from subcellular domain-specific localization of formin proteins in metazoan  <cit>  and plant  <cit>  cells. a recent large-scale analysis of  <dig> protein superfamilies indicates that such a lack of correlation with the organisms' biological complexity  may represent a rather typical situation  <cit> .

nevertheless, highest numbers of formins among unicellular organisms were found in naegleria and paramecium, i.e. in organisms possessing rather sophisticated cell surface structures that might also bring specific requirements on  cytoskeletal organizers, including the fh <dig> proteins.

we have performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of nearly  <dig> fh <dig> domain sequences . because of the relatively small size and high divergence of the fh <dig> domain, only limited resolution was achieved. moreover, lack of a suitable outgroup prevented convincing characterization of mutual relationships between the well-defined branches. nevertheless, we have confirmed the presence of the  <dig> previously proposed mammalian groups  <cit> , and two classes in angiosperm plants  <cit> . however, the basal position and monophyly of fungal formins, originally suggested on the basis of a very limited set of data  <cit> , was not confirmed, albeit fh <dig> domains of ascomycete yeasts did cluster together . even within the conserved clades, identification of orthologues is difficult or impossible. the topology of the well-resolved branches of the phylogenetic tree strongly suggests that they represent clusters of paralogues that have arisen by series of independent, species-specific gene duplication events. besides of the previously known two plant formin classes, we have identified a novel formin clade present only in non-seed green plants , which we termed class iii.

analysis of the domain architecture of our formin collection revealed several novel domain combinations besides the "canonical" opisthokont gbd/fh3-fh1-fh <dig> structure and the two architectures previously described for angiosperms . some of these novel architectures have already been described either in the course of systematic surveys  <cit>  or incidentally on the occasion of cdna or gene cloning .

in particular, the association between the pten domain  exhibited a discontinuous  distribution across the eukaryotic evolutionary tree, indicating either two independent gene fusion events, repeated losses or horizontal gene transfer. independent origin of identical domain combinations is considered extremely rare and thus unlikely  <cit> . however, this conclusion was based on an analysis of a sample of  <dig> prokaryotic genomes and only  <dig> eukaryotic ones, and its validity for eukaryotes may be therefore questionable. since the pten domains of stramenopile formins do not form a sister group to those of plant class ii formins , we indeed suspect that the association between the pten and fh <dig> domains was established twice. moreover, independent association with the fh <dig> domain was in both cases accompanied by an obvious loss of a conserved catalytic site, which was accomplished by different means in each lineage, i.e. again in a convergent fashion .

mutational inactivation of conserved, originally biochemically active domains might indeed present a common theme in formin evolution. we found that all formins with class iii fh <dig> domains posses a n-terminal domain exhibiting considerable similarity to the rho gtpase-activating protein  family proteins. however, the conserved arginine finger, essential for stimulation of the rho gtpase activity by rhogaps  <cit> , appears to be eliminated by mutations in all cases. thus, the rhogap-like domain of plant class iii formins is unlikely to act as a gtpase activating protein, unless it acquired the ability to activate gtpases through a different mechanism, as described in the case of the mammalian rap1gap  <cit> . "inactive" members of the rhogap family have been identified previously, such as mammalian p <dig>  which lost the gap activity while retaining its arginine finger, arap <dig> that lacks the arginine finger  <cit> , or mammalian and fungal iqgaps  <cit> . we believe that although proteins with gap domains are generally viewed predominantly as functionally well-defined components of the gtpase functional cycle, at least some of them obviously have acquired additional functions besides facilitating gtp hydrolysis and thus "re-setting" or "erasing" a signal carried by a gtp-loaded or "active" gtpase. obviously, to facilitate gtp hydrolysis, gaps have to interact with gtp-loaded gtpases, becoming thus also prime candidates for their effectors. in case of plant class iii formins, arap <dig>  iqgap or p <dig>  this presumed effector function apparently became selectively advantageous enough to allow surviving subsequent loss of the gap activity. indeed, iqgaps have been originally discovered as effectors of rho family gtpases, especially cdc <dig>  <cit> .

the rho gtpases are peripheral membrane proteins well-known for their participation in the control of cell surface-associated actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the formation of structures as diverse as lamellipodia and filopodia of animal cells, yeast buds, and plant root hairs and/or pollen tubes , believed to mediate rho-dependent activation of the formin through releasing intramolecular inhibition, stresses out the ancestral nature of another connection between rho and actin organization – namely formin-mediated actin nucleation  <cit> . however, plants have apparently lost the canonical gbd/fh3-fh1-fh <dig> architecture. nevertheless, our present analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of formin domain architectures in the plant lineage suggests that the ability to interact with a rho type gtpase presents a crucial conserved feature of many  formins even in plants. in particular, the combination of a presumably inactive rhogap-like domain with an f-actin interacting domain in early land plant formins is reminiscent of iqgaps, despite opposite domain order , suggesting a remarkable convergence also on the functional level. we suggest that the extant common architectures of plant class i, class ii and class iii formins may have been produced by a relatively simple sequence of evolutionary events that has maintained a continuity of the rho-fh <dig> and/or membrane-fh <dig> association, while the molecular mechanisms of these connections have changed .

first, the ancestral gbd/fh <dig> domain was replaced by a probably catalytically inactive rhogap-like domain at some point prior to the divergence of algae  and the lineage leading to extant vascular plants. this event was concomitant with the emergence of class iii formins. we can only speculate about the situation in rhodophyta since the only genome analyzed, that of cyanidioschyzon merolae, represents an extremely derived, fast-evolving group  <cit>  that either lost class iii formins or never possessed them . with respect to rhodophytes, the scenario shown in figure  <dig> thus presents one of two equally parsimonious possibilities that maintain the rho-fh <dig> connection; an alternative would involve replacement of gbd/fh <dig> by the rhogap-like domain only after the divergence of red algae, and loss of gbd/fh <dig> in the rhodophyte lineage.

in the "green" lineage leading towards green algae and vascular plants, a domain fusion produced the combination of fh <dig> with a catalytically inactive pten-related domain, generating thus the typical class ii architecture and providing a possible alternative mechanism for attachment of fh <dig> to a membrane. it is worth noting that the only chlorophytes lacking both class ii and class iii type architectures are the volvocal algae. we believe that this may again be a derived feature, since the recently published chlamydomonas genome sequence  <cit>  reveals that this organism has apparently lost rho-type gtpases altogether, possibly together with the whole associated molecular apparatus.

finally, in the vascular plant lineage a series of gene duplications took place in the formin gene family, starting prior to the divergence of bryophyta but continuing later on. amplified formin genes provided material for subsequent domain shuffling that produced the rich diversity of formins in extant angiosperms. it is tempting to speculate that this diversification may have been coincident with the ascent of plants on dry land. one of the innovations that appeared at the same time was the emergence of membrane-anchored class i formins. once the class i and class ii formins became established, plants acquired rho-independent means for associating the fh <dig> domains with membranes, which enabled subsequent loss of class iii formins in the angiosperm lineage.

in the course of our study, we have noticed that the diversity of formin domain architectures varies substantially among major eukaryotic lineages , suggesting a variety of possible regulatory inputs controlling the activity of the fh <dig> domain, its localization and interactions with diverse intracellular structures. despite of their rich formin gene families, neither plants nor metazoans present an extreme of fh <dig> domain mobility – the most diverse and variable formin architectures in our collection were apparently those of chromalveolates, mainly stramenopiles . however, major differences in formin diversity are not restricted to the level of kingdoms . in particular, invertebrate metazoans, such as molluscs or caenorhabditis, possess unusual domain combinations, such as formins carrying a membrane insertion signal or a zinc finger  <cit> .

this leads to the open question what determines the varying degree of fh <dig> domain mobility, or promiscuity, in diverse lineages. apparently this is not a feature of the fh <dig> domain per se, since all fungal, insect, crustacean and kinetoplastide formins studied so far exhibit only the canonical gbd/fh3-fh1-fh <dig> architecture or its even simpler fh1-fh <dig> variant. alternatively, we could imagine that some lineages have a general tendency to amplify genes and generate novel domain combinations; thus, organisms with unusual formin architectures should also exhibit greater diversity in other modular, multidomain proteins. however, this is not the case – caenorhabditis elegans has one of the richest families of formins among animals, but at least one other modular domain, namely sh <dig>  exhibits rather modest diversity compared to other metazoans . indeed, results of a large-scale analysis of eukaryotic proteins containing domains from the pfam database suggested that protein domains form lineage-rather than domain-specific combinations  <cit> . although the authors of the cited study consider this an animal-specific feature, their conclusion is based on a data set containing mostly animal and fungal genomes, and only very few species from other lineages. in particular, no stramenopiles have been included, and plants were represented only by arabidopsis, rice and the highly derived rhodophyte cyanidioschyzon merolae. upon closer inspection of the data from  <cit> , mere omission of c. merolae would lead to the result that plants  have a number of lineage-specific domain combinations comparable to that of mammals and birds.

results of our analysis of the formin structure in plants and other eukaryotes thus support the conclusion that domain architecture variability is not only a lineage-specific characteristic, but also a feature of the protein family involved. on a more general level, they also point out the limits for extrapolation from lineage-biased data, which, after all, only provide information about the species analyzed.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of a set of nearly  <dig> formin sequences from a variety of species representing most of the eukaryotic diversity revealed a surprising variability in terms of gene number and domain composition both among and within individual lineages. apart of ancestral domain combinations, such as the ubiquitous fh1-fh <dig> or the nearly ubiquitous gbd/fh3-fh1-fh <dig> architecture, lineage-specific domain architectures were found in particular in the plant lineage, where we identified a novel class of formins carrying a presumably catalytically inactive variant of the conserved rhogap domain. at least in case of the fh <dig> domain-containing proteins, we can conclude that the selection or "space" of available domain combinations is determined not only by the participating domains themselves, but also  by the organismal lineage. nevertheless, we were able to detect cases of repeated independent emergence of domain combinations, such as pten-fh1-fh <dig> in plants and stramenopiles, suggesting that there may be a certain preference of domain partnerships. in any case, we can conclude that the frequency of convergent domain combinations may be higher than expected before on the basis of predominantly prokaryotic data.
