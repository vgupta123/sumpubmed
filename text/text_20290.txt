BACKGROUND
in this work we present evidence that the p <dig> tumor suppressor and nf-κb transcription factors could be related through common descent from a family of ancestral transcription factors regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. p <dig> and related proteins are transcription factors that regulate dna repair and cellular apoptosis in response to stress and injury, notably those resulting in dna damage  <cit> . although it is a non-essential gene, loss of p <dig> function in humans through hereditary syndromes is associated with a markedly increased rate of malignancy. furthermore, over 50% of malignancies have mutated p <dig> alleles  <cit> . these observations suggest p <dig> and related proteins function as a checkpoint for malignant transformation either by repairing dna damage or by eliminating cells with irreparably damaged dna  <cit> 

p <dig> is a homotetrameric transcription factor that binds a consensus sequence 5' rrrrcgyyy-3'  <cit> . the consensus sequence is usually present as a dimer in p <dig> inducible gene promoters such as the p21waf <dig> protein regulating cell cycle progression  <cit> . p <dig> protein can be divided into three functional domains, the amino-terminal activation domain encompassing amino acids 1– <dig>  the core sequence-specific dna-binding domain , and the multi-functional carboxy-terminal domain   <cit> . point mutations in p <dig> identified in malignant cells are clustered around volutionarily conserved regions in the dna binding region of p <dig> and simultaneously eliminate both sequence-specific dna binding and transcriptional activity  <cit> .

p <dig> is regulated on multiple levels including post-translationally by modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, protein degradation, and protein-protein interaction  <cit> . phosphorylation of p <dig> induces conformational changes that alter interactions with regulatory proteins such as mdm <dig>  which in turn can regulate p <dig> stability, and can also activate site-specific dna binding activity  <cit> . additional cellular proteins that bind to p <dig> include proteins of the general transcription machinery such as cbp/p <dig>  <cit> . cbp/p <dig> binding to p <dig> regulates acetylation and p <dig> transcriptional activation  <cit> . p <dig> is also regulated through association with ankyrin repeat proteins such as p <dig> binding protein  <dig>  and p <dig> binding protein  <dig>   <cit>  and gankyrin  <cit> . thus, it is likely that p <dig> is modulated by association with and/or modification by a variety of regulatory proteins including kinases, transcription factors, and ankyrin-containing proteins. in addition, viral proteins also bind to and modify p <dig> and may contribute to malignant transformation of infected cells by viruses such as papilloma  <cit> , cytomegalovirus  <cit> , and epstein-barr virus  <cit> .

nf-κb transcription factors also play a central role in the control of apoptosis  <cit> . nf-κb transcription factors bind to the consensus sequence 5'-ggrnnyycc-3' in the promoters of both cellular and viral genes  <cit> . the rela/p <dig> subunit of nf-κb is regulated by the ankyrin repeat protein iκbα which masks the nuclear localization signal of the p65/p <dig> nf-κb heterodimer  <cit> . nf-κb-inducing signals are transmitted from the cell surface to the cytoplasm resulting in site-specific phosphorylation at two sites in the n-terminus of iκbα  <cit> , conjugation of ubiquitin molecules to iκbα, and subsequent degradation of ubiquitinated iκbα by the 26s proteasome complex  <cit> . degradation of iκbα in turn unmasks the nuclear localization signal of p50/p <dig> followed by translocation of the active transcription factor to the nucleus. other nf-κb subunits including a homodimer of the p <dig> subunit also bind iκbα  <cit> . iκbα deficient animals while viable, die of uncontrolled inflammation in infancy, and mice overexpressing iκbα display an abnormal immunologic repertoire suggesting that a major physiologic role of iκbα is to limit immune and inflammatory responses through a feedback pathway  <cit> .

interactions between p <dig> and nf-κb have been noted, for example both factors compete for a binding site in the regulatory factor cbp/p <dig>  <cit> . transfection of a constitutively active form of iκbα protein can block p <dig> dependent cell death  <cit>  and p <dig> regulatory factors can modulate nf-κb pathways  <cit> . not only are p <dig> and nf-κb transcription coregulated under a variety of physiological conditions, but similarity has been noted between the crystal structures of p <dig> and nf-κb p <dig>  <cit> . both proteins contain a similarly sited zinc atom that coordinates site specific dna binding and similar secondary and tertiary organization, but no primary amino acid similarity was noted between the two proteins. furthermore, p <dig> has been shown to bind the ankyrin protein p53-binding protein  <dig> . 53bp <dig> has been shown to be a fragment of a larger protein, aspp <dig>  that promotes the apoptotis-inducing effects of p <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> apparently inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by binding to 53bp2/assp <dig>  <cit> . as with p <dig>  nf-κb transcription is altered by viral pathogens  <cit> .

in this work, we present evidence for the specific binding of the nf-κb inhibitor and ankyrin protein, iκbα, to p <dig>  a physical interaction between p <dig> and iκbα was also reported by chang  <cit> , as well as zhou, et al.  <cit> , and was shown to be regulated by proapoptotic and growth suppressing stimuli. our studies show the binding interaction to involve both ankyrin and non-ankyrin sequences in the iκbα protein, and the dna binding core domain of p <dig>  we demonstrate that transient expression of iκbα is associated with nf-κb independent decreases in p <dig> mediated transcription of a p <dig> reporter gene in vivo. these observations were made in akata cells, an ebv-genome positive lymphoblastoid cell line originally derived from a burkitts lymphoma. akata cells lack endogenous functional p <dig>  <cit> . we propose that the binding of the ankyrin protein iκbα to p <dig> is based upon the similarity in molecular structure of nf-κb and p <dig> 

RESULTS
similarity between p <dig> and nf-κb transcription element binding sites
the hemi-dyad dna consensus binding sites of p <dig> and nf-κb transcription factors are intriguingly similar as has been noted previously by foo, et al.,  <cit> ; for p <dig>  the binding site sequence is 5'-rrrrcgyyy-3' and for nf-κb the binding site sequence is 5'- gggrnnyycc-3' where n, r, and y indicate any nucleotide, purine , and pyrimidine , respectively. two changes in the nucleotide sequence of the cg core  of a p <dig> binding site is sufficient to generate the rnny core  of a nf-κb binding site while sequences flanking the core are conserved. depending on the specific sequences, these binding sites potentially encode a hairpin structure that could promote these nucleotide substitutions. under these circumstances, only one mutagenic event would be necessary, since the second nucleotide exchange could occur by excision-repair following a mutagenic event in the first site. based on this observation, we hypothesized that both regulatory factors shared descent from a common ancestral transcription factor, a proto-p53/nf-κb. an alternative possibility is that two independent families of transcription factors, proto-p <dig> and proto-nf-κb, converged to independently recognize a similar recognition sequence.

if both p <dig> and nf-κb descended from a common ancestral protein, they might retain the ability to bind to common proteins or proteins of related structures in addition to binding similar dna sequences. with independent descent converging upon a similar dna binding sequence no such common interactions would be expected. in support of descent from a common ancestral protein, the crystal structure of nf-κb p <dig> aligns with that of p <dig>  a relationship that would not be expected unless the two proteins were related through phylogeny  as well as ontogeny . furthermore, numerous p <dig> binding proteins have in common the ankyrin repeat structure, a feature shared with the iκb family of nf-κb regulatory proteins.

structural alignment of p <dig> and p <dig> and ankyrin proteins, 53bp <dig> and iκbα
to test the hypothesis that p <dig> and p <dig> may share structural homology, the known crystal structures of both molecules were aligned using the program c3d <dig>   <cit> . p <dig>  has previously been crystallized in association with the ankyrin protein 53bp <dig>   <cit> . like iκbα , 53bp <dig> is also an ankyrin protein and has been identified as a fragment of a larger protein known as aspp <dig>   <cit> . the structure of p <dig>  is taken from the crystal structure of the dimer comprised of p <dig> and p <dig> in association with iκbα  <cit> . p <dig> has also been crystallized as a homodimer in association with iκbβ  <cit> .

we used the information content algorithm of c3d <dig>  which uses a blosum <dig> based matrix to calculate conservation between the two pairs of proteins: p <dig> and p <dig> ; and iκbα and 53bp <dig> . the amino acids colored red in the aligned structures of 1d and 2d and the amino acid sequences of 1e and 2e depict regions of highest conservation while the grey areas are regions where there is no conservation. as shown by the regions of the two molecules colored red, we observed a surprising degree of structural alignment between the rel homology domain of p <dig> and the p <dig> core domain, supposedly unrelated molecules . the sequence alignment corresponding to the structures in 1d is depicted in 1e.

using these same methods, we aligned the structures of the ankyrin proteins, iκbα  <cit>  and 53bp <dig> . the structure used for iκbα  contains 71– <dig> of the wild-type protein. we omitted the sh <dig> domain of the 53bp <dig> structure  since it is not relevant to this report. the iκbα protein contains six ankyrin motifs while the 53bp <dig> contains four. as expected, the two ankyrin proteins show a high degree of alignment. the fourth and 5th ankyrins of iκbα are in very close alignment to the second and third ankyrins of 53bp <dig> . the sequences corresponding to these structures is shown in figure 2e.

specific binding between iκbα and p <dig> occurs in vitro
purified iκbα protein was specifically labelled in vitro with  using p90rsk which we have previously shown to quantitatively phosphorylate iκbα.  -labeled iκbα was incubated with purified p <dig>  and precipitated either with glutathione/sepharose  beads to bind the glutathione binding tag on gst-p <dig> or a p53-specific antibody  and protein a/g beads. as shown in figure  <dig>  evidence of a specific association between purified bacterially-produced p <dig> and purified bacterially-produced wild-type iκbα was observed in vitro . the conformation-specific p <dig> antibody  does not recognize bacterially produced p <dig> , and ab <dig> was used as a control for non-specific association between iκbα and antibody or protein a/g beads. a c-jun protein with a glutathione binding protein tag  was used as a control for non-specific association between iκbα and glutathione beads. as shown, no association between control proteins or antibodies was evident.

relatively decreased in vitro binding between iκbα and p <dig> results from deletion of the n-terminus of iκbα
initial experiments conducted with both p <dig> and iκbα made in bacterial cells supported the hypothesis that the p <dig> protein could bind to iκbα. post-translational modifications of the proteins when expressed in eukaryotic cells could affect the interactions noted, particularly with respect to relative binding affinities of mutant proteins. furthermore, bacterially produced protein may differ in conformation to those produced in mammalian hosts. overexpression of iκbα alleles in cos cells was used to confirm that binding to p <dig> was evident with iκbα produced in vivo and also to map the p <dig> binding to sites within iκbα. only some alleles of iκbα can be overexpressed in cos cells including iκbα deleted of n-terminal regulatory sequences, denoted Δn <dig>  Δa <dig> , and Δc <dig> deleted of the pest-containing non-ankyrin c- terminus . a schematic of deletion mutants of iκbα used is depicted in figure 3c.

after expression of iκbα in cos cells, whole cell lysates were co-precipitated with bacterially produced purified gst-p <dig> . these experiments confirmed that binding between the proteins was not related to production of an aberrant form of the iκbα protein in bacterial cells since alleles of iκbα protein produced in cos cells were enriched by incubation and co-precipitation with gst-p <dig>  in representative experiments shown, relatively less Δn <dig> protein protein co-precipitated with gst-p <dig> from cos cell lysates as compared to the proportions of Δa <dig> or Δc <dig> iκbα proteins associating with p <dig> suggesting that binding between the proteins at least in part required an intact n-terminal region of iκbα. relative co-precipitation of the c-terminally deleted form of iκbα was comparable to that of wild-type protein , suggesting that the amino acids 264– <dig> of iκbα was not important for binding to p <dig> 

the binding between iκbα and p <dig> is disrupted by an antibody to the dna-binding region of p53
experiments detailed above confirmed that a specific binding association occurs between iκbα and p <dig> in vitro. further experiments were designed to approximate the region on p <dig> responsible for iκbαbinding by use of epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. glutathione-sepharose beads  were used to precipitate p <dig>  and were found to co-precipitate iκbα. a monoclonal antibody directed at amino acids 46– <dig> in the amino terminus of p <dig>  recognized purified bacterially produced p <dig>  and also co-precipitated iκbα with p <dig> . in contrast, a different p53-specific monoclonal antibody directed at amino acids 212– <dig> within the dna binding core of p <dig> , while able to recognize and precipitate bacterially produced p <dig> protein , did not co-precipitate iκba . these observations suggested that the binding site between purified iκbα and p <dig> in part coincided with the ab <dig> epitope, a region which is within the p <dig> dna binding core. alternatively, the antibody could hinder or disrupt iκbα binding to regions near the recognized. epitope or alter the structure of p <dig> into a conformation unfavorable for iκbα binding.

overexpression of wild-type iκbα modulates p <dig> dependent transcription of a synthetic p <dig> reporter gene in vivo
in vitro studies supported the hypothesis that a direct physical association between p <dig> and iκbα can occur but they did not provide evidence that such interactions occur in vivo. we hypothesized that transient overexpression of iκbα in cells with co-transfected transcriptionally active p <dig> might reveal effects of iκbα upon p <dig> mediated transcription. using forced overexpression of both proteins from identical viral cmv promoter elements rather than endogenous promoters would eliminate confounding transcriptional effects of iκbα upon transcription of p <dig> or vice versa. any effect of nf-κb upon cmv would be normalized as well.

akata cells were used because these b-lymphoblastoid cells are known to lack endogenous p <dig>  neither the wild-type nor a mutant protein is expressed that could complicate interpretation of results. p <dig> transiently transfected into these cells using dextran sulfate is transcriptionally active. as a control for non-specific effects of transfected plasmid dna, effects of iκbα expression plasmids were compared to co-transfected plasmid containing an identical cmv promoter element . results shown were also normalized to expression of co-transfected prl-sv <dig>  a plasmid expressing a second form of luciferase as a control for cell viability and transfection efficiency. we found that wild-type iκbα was associated with decreased p53-dependent transcription of the p <dig> reporter gene pgpyluc in akata cells . increasing the relative ratio of transfected expression plasmids between iκbα and p <dig> from 1: <dig>  to 10: <dig>  demonstrated a dose response effect that varied with different iκbα alleles. immunoblotting for wt-p <dig>  Δc-p <dig>  and iκbα alleles show relatively equivalent protein levels for these proteins in these extracts .

allele specific modulation of p <dig> transcription by iκbα are independent of the effects of the alleles on nf-κb transcription in vivo
the wild-type iκbα protein is subject to signal-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation leading to release of inhibition of nf-κb. deletion  or mutation of the phosphorylation sites  in the amino terminus of iκbα leads to a stable mutant that constitutively represses nf-κb transcription. cotransfection at a  <dig> to  <dig> ratio of Δn <dig> to p <dig> expression plasmid  had no significant effects upon p <dig> transcription . increasing the relative ratio of Δn <dig> expression plasmid to p <dig> showed that at higher ratios, Δn <dig> could significantly decrease p53-dependent transcription . however, at the lower ratio of 4: <dig> shown for the wild-type p <dig> allele, in figure 5a, there was little inhibition of transcriptional activity by Δn <dig>  the relatively poor inhibitory activity of Δn <dig> towards p <dig> is consistent with its relatively poor binding affinity for p <dig> as shown in figure 3b and described above.

the finding that the Δn <dig> allele is only partially competent to inhibit p <dig> is consistent with our previous observation that deletion of the n-terminus of iκbα reduced its physical affinity for p <dig> . while the Δn <dig> allele is a super-repressor of nf-κb, the Δa <dig> allele does not repress nf-κb, and thus this allele could be used to ask whether p <dig> repression and nf-κb inhibition are separable characteristics of the iκbα molecule. remarkably, Δa <dig>  which cannot repress nf-κb transcription, had very pronounced inhibitory effects upon transcription by p <dig> , comparable to that of wild-type.

mapping of interactions between iκbα and p <dig> in vivo to the ankyrin  <dig> domain of iκbα
ankyrin regions in iκbα, shared with other members of the iκb gene family are the sites of binding to nf-κb transcription factor family members. further experiments were performed to define the effects of deletion of additional ankyrin domains of iκbα upon p <dig> transcription in akata cells. in these experiments, shown in figure  <dig>  iκbα plasmids were transfected at  <dig> ng . deletion of either the second  or fourth ankyrin domains  had the most potent inhibitory effects upon p <dig> transcription. deletion of amino acids 264– <dig> in the carboxyl terminus , distal to the 6th ankyrin domian, were similarly inhibitory. this region retains the 6th ankyrin domain but deletes a potentially regulatory acidic pest region. deletion of the ankyrin  <dig> domain of iκbα was not evaluated in this work.

in multiple experiments with wild-type p <dig>  deletion of the ankyrin  <dig>  domain of iκbα  resulted in a loss of inhibitory activity towards p <dig> transcription. thus Δa <dig> acts as a null allele for both p <dig> and nf-κb transcription in vivo, while other ankyrin deletion alleles of iκbα  act as null alleles for nf-κb but gain of function with respect to p <dig>  thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ankyrin  <dig> and n-terminus of iκbα are cooperatively or independently involved in repressing p <dig>  we cannot, however, rule out an alternative possibility, that the deletion of the ankyrin  <dig>  of iκbα resulted in a protein with high turnover in akata cells.

relative effects of alleles of iκbα are conserved with constitutively active p <dig> and require transcriptionally active p53
p <dig> transcription is regulated in part by phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of the protein. phosphorylation induces a conformational change in p <dig> so that an auto-inhibitory region of the carboxyl terminus no longer inhibits dna binding  <cit> . to determine whether the effects of iκbα upon p <dig> transcription required the auto-inhibitory carboxyl terminus of p <dig>  experiments were repeated with a truncated form of p <dig> containing the first  <dig> amino acids  together with an 8-fold excess of iκbα plasmid . as expected, these experiments demonstrated increased p <dig> transcriptional activity measured as p <dig> -dependent transcription of pgpy/luc in akata cells at the same plasmid concentrations compared to experiments using wild-type p <dig>  co-transfection of a fixed concentration of a plasmid expressing Δc-p <dig> protein , and iκbα alleles  demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of p <dig> was not required for the association between p53-dependent transcription and iκbα expression. as in experiments with wild-type p <dig>  deletion of the ankyrin  <dig>  domain of iκbα was associated with greater decreases in p53-dependent transcription than other alleles of iκbα. a transcriptionally inactive p <dig> mutated in the p <dig> dna binding core  gave very low levels of luciferase activity that were not altered by co-transfection of any iκbα alleles . thus, the effects of iκbα upon p <dig> transcription in akata cells were found to be entirely dependent upon the presence of co-transfected transcriptionally active p <dig> but independent of the carboxyl-terminus regulatory sequences of p <dig> 

allele specific association between iκbα and p <dig> synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate  system correspond to allele specific modulation of transcription in vivo
some alleles of iκbα including Δa <dig> and Δa <dig> were not stable in cos cells . therefore, cos cells could not be used to determine the correlation between iκbα and p <dig> binding in vitro  and transcriptional effects in akata cells . thus, to overcome this technical problem, p <dig> and iκbα proteins were both separately synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system . iκbα synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate system is functionally active in its effects upon nf-κb transcription factors and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. likewise, but in contrast to bacterially synthesized p <dig>  p <dig> synthesized in rrl system is functionally active as a site-specific dna-binding protein and like iκbα is degraded in vitro by a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. experiments were performed to determine whether rrl produced p <dig> that could interact with iκbα alleles likewise translated in vitro in rrl.

coupled transcription/translation of a plasmid encoding wild-type p <dig> in rrl  resulted in several template-specific products that could be precipitated from lysates with p53-specific monoclonal antibodies . these products appeared to be a mixture of full length and less-than full-length p <dig> proteins resulting from internal initiation sites in the p <dig> template. negative control precipitation with igg2a immunoglobulin  or protein g/a beads  resulted in undetectable levels of p <dig> recovery.

iκbα was precipitated with a polyclonal antiserum directed at the iκbα c-terminus in the absence  or presence of p <dig>  protein after both proteins were synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate system . deletion of the carboxyl terminus of iκbα did not interfere with binding between gst-p <dig> and iκbα synthesized in cos cells , suggesting that binding of antibody directed at the iκbα carboxyl terminus would not interfere with binding between p <dig> and iκbα. visual inspection and gel densitometry of these co-precipitation experiments confirmed a specific association between wild-type iκbα and p <dig>  the association of Δa <dig> iκbα allele to p <dig> was significantly reduced  as determined by gel densitometry  relative to the association between the wild-type iκbα, Δa <dig>  and Δa <dig> alleles of iκbα to p <dig>  gel densitometry was not sensitive enough to determine whether small differences in the binding of other iκbα alleles to p <dig> were significant. in the absence of labeled iκbα, bands corresponding to p <dig> were still evident  suggesting either non-specific binding or co-precipitation with endogenous unlabeled iκbα. there are small quantities of immuno-detectable iκbα in certain preparations of rrl . similar results were obtained in experiments in which an antibody against p <dig>  were used to co-precipitate p <dig> and iκbα alleles . binding was also evident between iκbα and p53-related proteins smaller in size than full-length p <dig> although these interactions could not be reliably quantitated due to variable co-migrating protein species in the relevant portions of the gel.

in vivo binding of Δa5-iκbα to wild-type p53
the melanoma cell line a <dig> expressing endogenous wild-type p <dig> was stably transfected with the hemagluttinin -tagged Δa <dig> allele of iκbα  <cit> . the Δa <dig> allele was chosen because it has no effect on nf-κb activity but is one of the more potent alleles of iκbα in modulating p53-dependent transcription. several independent stable clones as well as pooled transfectants were expanded and used for experiments for which results of the pooled transfectants  are shown here . results were qualitatively similar with pooled vs cells expanded from single colonies. pooled transformants resulting from antibiotic selection of vector transfected cells were used as controls . association of Δa5-iκbα with p <dig> was evident when uv-irradiated cell extracts were immunoprecipated using anti-p <dig> antibody and the immunoprecipitates probed with anti-iκbα antibody . likewise, association between transfected iκbα and p <dig> are evident when immunoprecipitates generated using anti-ha were probed with anti-p <dig> . immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit serum  precipitated little or no iκbα or p <dig>  association between endogenous wild-type iκbα and p <dig> are also evident as seen by the upper band detectable with anti-iκbα western blotting in con and da <dig> lanes when extracts are precipitated with anti-p <dig>  when extracts of irradiated cells are immunoprecipitated with anti-ha, and immunoblotted with anti-iκbα, both endogenous and Δa <dig> are evident. this is likely due to the precipitation of wt- iκbα with the p53/ Δa5-iκbα complex since p <dig> exists as a tetramer.

discussion
in this work we determined that iκbα and p <dig> bind in vitro through a specific interaction in part involving the dna binding region of p <dig>  or a region proximal to it, and the amino terminus of iκbα independently or cooperatively with the ankyrin  <dig> domain of iκbα. a physical interaction between p <dig> and iκbα has been noted by two other groups  <cit> . generally, our data corroborate these previously reported interactions and provide further evidence for direct transcriptional modulation of p <dig> by iκbα. there are some notable differences in our observations from that of others, in particular, the binding site on iκbα was reported as existing in the non-ankyrin c-terminus by chang  <cit>  in an yeast two-hybrid system using a deletion construct missing amino acids 244- <dig>  this construct in fact deletes the 6th ankyrin domain of iκbα, located at amino acids  <dig> –  <dig>  retained in our c-terminal deletion construct  which also retains p <dig> binding and regulation. when the data are taken in toto, it can be inferred that in fact the 6th ankyrin domain, retained in our construct but deleted in chang's, may in fact contain another p <dig> contact point, the loss of which were observed by chang but not by us.

we also found that deletion of the ankyrin  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> domains of iκbα increased the inhibitory effect of iκbα on p53-dependent transcription in akata cells. we speculate that the compacting of the structure by elimination of an ankyrin domain may promote better binding of the protein to p <dig> as it may convert iκbα to a structure closer in size to that of 53bp <dig> which only contains four ankyrins. mutations in the ankyrin regions of iκbα have been characterized regarding their effects upon nf-κb-mediated transcription as well as nuclear translocation, with most deletions of ankyrins including deletion of ankyrin  <dig> leading to a null phenotype  with respect to nf-κb transcription. nevertheless, over-expression of Δa5-iκbα was more effective than wild-type at decreasing p <dig> transcription at all but the lowest concentrations examined. thus, it was evident that over-expression of some alleles of iκbα could influence p <dig> transcription independently of their effects upon transcription by nf-κb. deletion of the ankyrin  <dig> region of iκbα eliminated detectable interactions between iκbα and p <dig> in vivo and in vitro suggesting a critical role of the ankyrin  <dig> region in a specific in vivo interaction with p <dig>  the combined results obtained using bacterially produced iκbα and p <dig>  as well as rrl produced proteins  suggest a correlation between in vitro co-precipitation in at least one of the systems and in vivo p <dig> inhibitory activity. these observations argue for a mechanism involving direct binding of iκbα to p <dig> in the inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity.

our interpretation of these observations is that binding between iκbα and p <dig> occurs primarily between the p <dig> dna-binding core or a region proximal to it, and the ankyrin  <dig> and n-terminal regions of iκbα. binding results in decreased p53-dependent transcription when both iκbα and p <dig> are overexpressed in vivo. these results are consistent with those published by zhou, et al.  <cit>  where induction of p <dig> regulatable genes such as p <dig> and mdm <dig> in response to doxorubicin was abrogated by expression of a degradation-resistant form of iκbα. these interactions are strikingly similar to the known interactions between iκbα and its physiologic ligand, nf-κb. we suggest that these interactions are a result of a conserved relationship, i.e., that of a common descent, of p <dig> and p <dig> from a primordial transcription factor which we term proto p53/nf-κb . not only do the two transcription factors bind ankyrin proteins but both nf-κb and p <dig> have similar dna binding sites . furthermore, both factors bind a viral protein encoded by the ebv bzlf- <dig> open reading frame  and can transcription can be modulated by this viral protein when overexpressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> . as shown in figure 8c, we found that a cryptic ankyrin like region is present in the dimerization region of bzlf- <dig>  coincident with the region required for binding to both p <dig> and p <dig>  with the exception of ankyrin domains, bzlf- <dig> and iκbα are otherwise not similar in sequence, structure, or function.

thus, ankyrin repeat domains appear to be key points of interaction between diverse proteins in the nf-κb and p <dig> superfamilies. a similar conclusion is suggested by the crystal structure of a complex between p <dig> and 53bp <dig>  <cit> . 53bp <dig> is a  <dig> amino acid protein containing four ankyrin repeats that has been found to be a fragment of an even larger protein known as aspp <dig>  residues tysd located in the 4th ankyrin repeat of 53bp2/aspp <dig>  binds to the l <dig> loop of p <dig> immediately after the zinc ligand site in p <dig>  while the non-ankyrin, sh <dig> domain of 53bp <dig> also contribute to the binding interactions. these four residues in 53bp2/aspp <dig> are exactly aligned with an equivalent block in the sixth ankyrin repeat of iκbα . it is interesting to note that this corresponds to the 6th ankyrin domain predicted to be a contact point for p <dig> as outlined above. paradoxically, 53bp2/aspp <dig> is exclusively cytoplasmic thus it may only inhibit and sequester p <dig> in the cytoplasm. iκbα thus may fall into a paradigm of endogenous and viral p <dig> regulatory proteins where ankyrin and non-ankyrin domains contribute to p <dig> binding and transcriptional modulation. other ankyrin proteins that bind to either nf-κb or p <dig> could also bind and potentially modulate each other.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, modulation of p <dig> transcription by iκbα and related host and viral proteins could play a role in the regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo. both p <dig> and iκbα are members of multi-gene families, and both protein families regulate apoptosis. previously, a cooperative relationship between p53-dependent apoptosis and nf-κb activation had been reported  <cit> . our observations may represent the converse of this situation where inactivation of nf-κb  results in inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity. alternatively, a situation where accumulation of iκbα free of nf-κb, as a result of phosphorylation of p <dig> by rsk <dig> and ensuing dissociation of nf-κb from iκbα, could result in the regulation of p <dig> by iκbα  <cit> . another setting where our observations may play a significant physiological role is during herpesvirus infection. the epstein-barr nuclear antigen  contains a region enriched in gly-ala repeats, and this repeat sequence inhibits the 26s proteasome leading to inhibition of peptide presentation by the mhc class i restricted pathway  <cit> . ebna <dig> is expressed during viral latency, a condition where it is beneficial for the virus to inhibit apoptosis. proteasome inhibition will lead to inhibition of all cellular protein degradation and the impact would be the greatest on those proteins with extremely short half-lives such as p <dig> and iκbα. thus, the accumulation of iκbα under these circumstances may down regulate the activity of p <dig> 

decreased p53-dependent transcription could limit the ability of p <dig> to trigger cellular apoptosis in the presence of inflammation since levels of targets of nf-κb, including iκbα, are up-regulated. if, in fact, iκbα inhibits or dampens p <dig> function, cells could continue to proliferate and differentiate in the presence of an inflammatory event even if there is dna damage or other cellular injury that would normally activate p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. thus, a combination of inflammation and cellular damage could increase malignant transformation of cells since the threshold for p <dig> levels to trigger apoptosis may be elevated. it is notable that we know little about what thresholds regulate p <dig> function – in particular, what determines whether a cell repairs dna and resumes transit through the cell cycle or dies. a molecule such as iκbα may be involved in influencing threshold-dependent cell fate decisions. the observation that truncated p <dig> proteins may bind to iκbα raises the possibility that short p53-related peptides could alter the binding between iκbα and p <dig>  in turn altering a putative regulatory relationship between these proteins in vivo. modulation of this regulatory interaction by pharmacologic or other means could potentially alter the balance between cellular proliferation and cell cycle arrest/apoptosis in the context of inflammation.
