BACKGROUND
the early xenopus laevis embryo provides a rich context in which to investigate cell cycle regulation and the interplay between the cell cycle and development. the first twelve cleavage cycles following fertilization consist of rapid oscillations between s and m phase without intervening gap phases. these cell cycles do not engage checkpoints in response to damaged or unreplicated dna  <cit> . rather, embryonic cells that have incurred such assaults to the genome die by a maternally regulated program of apoptosis during gastrulation  <cit> . beginning at the midblastula transition , cell cycles lengthen, acquiring gap phases and operable cell cycle checkpoints  <cit> . furthermore, damaged or unreplicated dna may trigger abnormal development but generally will not induce apoptosis  <cit> . although the molecular players in cell cycle remodeling during the early development of x. laevis have been well characterized, little is known about the underlying controls that govern these events.

early embryonic cell cycles are regulated by three cyclin-dependent kinase  complexes. cyclin a/cdk <dig> and cyclin b/cdk <dig> are the m-phase cdks, and cyclin e/cdk <dig> is the s-phase cdk  <cit> , although their functions may overlap  <cit> . the activity of the mitotic cdk complexes are controlled by cyclin synthesis and degradation and by inhibitory phosphorylations on threonine  <dig> and tyrosine  <dig> by wee <dig> and myt  <dig> kinases  <cit> . phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of cdks is counteracted by members of the cdc <dig> family of phosphatases  <cit> . in x. laevis, wee <dig> kinase is present in pre-mbt embryos, but degraded after the mbt  <cit> . prior to the mbt in x. laevis embryos, wee <dig> and myt <dig> act in opposition to cdc25c, inhibiting cdk <dig>  <cit> .

at the mbt, the profile of kinases and phosphatases regulating cdk activity is modified. both cdc25c and myt  <dig> persist at relatively constant levels. in contrast, cdc25a levels drop beginning at the mbt and maternally encoded wee <dig> disappears at gastrulation when it is replaced by the more active zygotic kinase, wee <dig>  <cit> . it is likely that this change in the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity operating on the cdks is an integral component of cell cycle remodeling that initiates at the mbt. in previous studies that support this hypothesis, overexpression of cdc25a accelerated  <cit> , whereas overexpression of wee <dig> lengthened cleavage cycles  <cit> .

in addition to its role in promoting s phase, cyclin e/cdk <dig> also serves a developmental function in early x. laevis embryos. oscillations in cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity constitute a maternal developmental timer that regulates the timing of the events of the mbt  <cit> . one of these events is the degradation of maternal cyclin e itself  <cit> . inhibition of cdk <dig> by the specific cdk inhibitor, Δ34xic <dig>  lengthens cleavage and delays the onset of the mbt and the degradation of cyclin e  <cit> . although cyclin e levels are constant throughout pre-mbt development, cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, independently of protein synthesis and the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio  <cit> . however, other inhibitors of the mbt such as α-amanitin  and cycloheximide  do not affect the timing of cyclin e degradation  <cit> , suggesting that the cyclin e/cdk <dig> timer regulates the mbt but not vice versa. overexpression of cyclin e in the early embryo disrupts nuclear divisions and triggers apoptosis after the mbt  <cit> . these effects are independent of cdk activity, suggesting further complexity of the role of cyclin e during early development. a better understanding of how the cyclin e/cdk <dig> developmental clock is regulated should give insight into the mechanisms that drive cell cycle remodeling at the mbt.

it has been proposed that oscillatory activity of cyclin e/cdk <dig> is governed by changes in phosphorylation state  <cit> . however, the kinases and phosphatases that govern cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity in x. laevis embryos are unknown. overexpression of chk <dig> in x. laevis embryos, which activates wee <dig> and inhibits cdc25a and cdc25c, delays both the mbt and cyclin e degradation  <cit> , suggesting that the cyclin e/cdk <dig> timer is regulated by its phosphorylation state. in mammalian cells, wee <dig> inhibits cyclin e/cdk <dig>  <cit> , but it was previously unknown whether wee <dig> regulated cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity in x. laevis.

wee <dig> is the opposing kinase of cdc <dig>  is degraded after the mbt, and functions to inhibit both cyclin b/cdk <dig> in metazoans and cyclin e/cdk <dig> in mammals. therefore, we disrupted the balance of cdk phosphatase and kinase activity by overexpressing wee <dig> in x. laevis embryos to more closely identify its role in cell cycle remodeling during the early embryonic development of x. laevis. our results indicate that an imbalance of cdk-inhibitory activity triggers apoptosis, most likely through the disruption of the cyclin e/cdk <dig> timer, since direct inhibition of cyclin e/cdk <dig> also induces apoptosis. these data suggest that proper coordination of cell cycle remodeling events at the mbt is required for embryonic survival. by comparing the developmental effects of cdk inhibitors that trigger apoptosis to those that inhibit apoptosis, we identified cdc25a as an important predictor of developmentally regulated apoptosis in x. laevis embryos.

RESULTS
overexpression of wee <dig> lengthens pre-mbt cell cycles
to determine the effect of disrupting the balance of cdk kinase and phosphatase activities in embryos prior to the mbt,  <dig>  ng mrna encoding wild-type wee <dig> or luciferase  was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos. western analysis confirmed expression of exogenous wee <dig> throughout the developmental stages examined . embryos expressing exogenous wee <dig> exhibited slower cleavage cycles. at  <dig>  hours post-fertilization , embryos expressing exogenous wee <dig> were delayed by approximately one cell cycle compared to controls embryos injected with luciferase mrna    <cit> . otherwise, these embryos developed with normal morphology through the mbt.

to determine whether the cell cycle lengthening induced by exogenous wee <dig> coincided with the phosphorylation of cdks, embryos expressing wee <dig> or luciferase were assayed by western analysis using a phosphocdk primary antibody . in untreated embryos, low-level tyrosine phosphorylation of cdks occurs prior to the mbt then increases at the mbt concurrent with cell cycle lengthening  <cit> . similarly, control embryos expressing luciferase demonstrated low levels of cdk phosphorylation until the mbt. in contrast, cdks were phosphorylated on tyrosine  <dig> as early as  <dig> hrs pf in embryos expressing exogenous wee <dig>  suggesting the cell cycle delay resulted from the inhibition of cdks.

mitotic cleavage cycles and nuclear cycles of dna replication can be uncoupled in early x. laevis embryos  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to determine whether exogenous wee <dig> also affected dna replication in early embryos. total dna was isolated from embryos expressing wee <dig> or luciferase, resolved by gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. embryos expressing exogenous wee <dig> contained less dna throughout early development, compared to luciferase controls . however, the dna content increased through the early development of embryos overexpresssing wee <dig> indicative of continuing dna replication. the rate of increase in dna content was consistent with the lengthened cleavage cycles, suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic cycles were coordinated. to examine nuclear morphology, embryos were collected at several stages, sectioned and stained with dapi. representative fields from embryos collected at stage  <dig> are shown in figure 1e. embryos overexpressing wee <dig> contained interphase and mitotic nuclei with normal morphology. there was no loss of nuclei as seen in embryos overexpressing cyclin e  <cit> , although there were fewer and larger cells in these embryos, consistent with the delayed cell cycles. these results indicate that the overexpression of wee <dig> delays both nuclear and cleavage cycles, but these cycles appear to remain coupled.

overexpression of wee <dig> triggers apoptosis after the mbt
in previous studies, we showed that x. laevis embryos expressing exogenous checkpoint kinases, chk <dig> or chk <dig>  exhibited a similar cell cycle delay and premature cdk phosphorylation  <cit> . furthermore, embryos expressing exogenous chk <dig> developed normally through neurulation and beyond, and exogenous chk <dig> protects embryos form apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation  <cit> .

embryos overexpressing wee <dig> developed normally through the mbt until early gastrulation . however, during gastrulation, these embryos began to appear abnormal, exhibiting a loss of cellular attachment and overall organization . the gross morphology of embryos expressing exogenous wee <dig> appeared consistent with that of embryos that had undergone apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation  <cit> , unreplicated dna, or expression of dominant-negative chk1/chk <dig>  <cit> .

to determine whether the kinase activity of wee <dig> was required for its disruption of development, embryos were microinjected with wild-type  or kinase-dead  wee <dig> mrna   <cit> . the embryos expressing kd wee <dig> developed normally through gastrulation , indicating that kinase activity is required for the effects of exogenous wee <dig> 

to determine whether overexpression of wee <dig> induced apoptosis, embryos were assayed for caspase activity in embryo lysates by the cleavage of exogenous human parp protein  <cit> . embryos expressing exogenous wee <dig> were positive for caspase activity at gastrulation  indicated by the presence of a cleaved parp fragment . these results were surprising since exogenous chk <dig> and chk <dig>  lengthen cleavage cycles and promote phosphorylation to the same extent as wee <dig>  yet exogenous chk <dig> and chk <dig> kinases inhibit rather than promote apoptosis  <cit> . like the effects on gross morphology, the activation of caspases was dependent on wee <dig> kinase activity as caspase activity was not detected in embryos expressing kd wee .

in x. laevis cell-free egg extracts, wee <dig> accelerates apoptosis through interaction with an sh <dig> domain in the crk-adaptor protein. furthermore, wee <dig> can restore apoptosis in extracts depleted of sh <dig> domain interactors  <cit> . to determine whether wee <dig> associates with crk in developing x. laevis embryos undergoing apoptosis, wee <dig> was immunoprecipated from embryo extacts and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for crk. constant levels of crk were detected even in lysates overexpessing wee <dig> . this data indicate an association between crk and wee <dig> in vivo, and that all available crk may be complexed with endogenous wee <dig> 

overexpression of wee <dig> promotes the persistence of cdc25a, cyclin e and cdk <dig> activity
in xenopus embryos, the mbt delineates a point when a host of cell cycle remodeling events occur. among these remodeling events are the degradation of maternal cdc25a  <cit>  and cyclin e  <cit> . in previous studies, we showed that overexpression of chk1/chk <dig> causes premature degradation of cdc25a and delayed degradation of cyclin e  <cit> . furthermore, the transient activation of chk <dig> at the mbt is required for the degradation of cdc25a  <cit> . since overexpression of chk <dig>  chk <dig>  and wee <dig> all lengthen the cell cycle and trigger premature phosphorylation of cdks, we wanted to investigate the effect of exogneous wee <dig> on the timing of cdc25a and cyclin e degradation, two hallmarks of the mbt.

messenger rna encoding wild-type wee <dig> or luciferase  was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos, then embryos were collected at the indicated times and subjected to western analysis of cdc25a and cyclin e. unlike chk1/chk <dig>  overexpression of wee <dig> resulted in delayed rather than accelerated degradation of cdc25a .

additionally, overexpression of wee <dig> delayed the degradation of cyclin e until mid-gastrulation , similar to overexpression of chk <dig>  <cit>  and the expression of exogenous Δ34-xic <dig>  <cit> . both chk <dig> and Δ34-xic <dig> inhibit cyclin e/cdk <dig> in embryos and are the only reagents known to delay the timing of cyclin e degradation in x. laevis embryos. this evidence and the prediction of our mathematical model suggest that timing of cyclin e degradation is determined by cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity itself  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that wee <dig> may also inhibit cyclin e/cdk <dig> in x. laevis embryos.

inhibition of cdk <dig> by wee <dig> has been well characterized in x. laevis and other systems  <cit> . in human hela cells, wee <dig> also phosphorylates cdk <dig>  inhibiting entry into s-phase  <cit> . in order to determine whether wee <dig> inhibits cdk <dig> in early x. laevis embryos, cyclin e was immunoprecipitated from embryos overexpressing wee <dig>  and western analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitates to detect inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation on cdk <dig>  embryos overexpressing wee <dig> expressed higher levels of phosphorylated cdk <dig>  indicating inhibition of cdk <dig> by wee <dig> . these results suggest that the delays in degradation of cyclin e and cdc25a by the overexpression of wee <dig> could be due to the inhibition of cdk <dig>  the inhibition of cyclin e/cdk <dig> is also consistent with the reduced dna content in embryos expressing wee <dig>  since cyclin e/cdk <dig> promotes the initiation of dna replication during s phase  <cit> .

to more directly measure cdk activity, cyclin e immunoprecipitates were tested for kinase activity against histone h <dig>  immunoprecipatates were incubated with histone h <dig> and γ-32p atp, reactions were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, h <dig> bands were excised, and counted by scintillation counting . despite the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cdk <dig> in embryos overexpressing wee <dig>  cdk <dig> kinase activity was not repressed. in fact, cdk <dig> activity persisted in these embryos after it had decreased after the mbt in control embryos. the persistence of cdk <dig> is consistent with the delay in cyclin e degradation . however, it was surprising that cdk <dig> activity was not reduced since we had observed tyrosine phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  and this phosphorylation event is known to inhibit cdk <dig> activity  <cit> . one explanation may be that exogenous wee <dig> only phosphorylates a fraction of wee <dig>  whether this fraction represents a specific pool that is inhibited or represents a steady state of total cdk <dig> is not known.

inhibition of cdk <dig> triggers apoptosis
overexpression of wee <dig> in xenopus embryos resulted in a post-mbt apoptotic death. since the overexpression of wee <dig> not only alters cell cycle remodeling events  and the concentration of dna at the mbt , but also phosphorylates cdk <dig> , we wanted to determine whether inhibition of cdk <dig> contributed to the induction of apoptosis. in order to inhibit cdk <dig> directly, one-cell stage embryos were injected with Δ34-xic <dig> protein or p27xic1ck- protein as a control. the Δ34-xic <dig> protein is a truncated form of the full length-xic <dig> that specifically inhibits the activity of cyclin e/cdk <dig> in x. laevis  <cit> . in x. leavis embryos, the expression of Δ34-xic <dig> delays the degradation of cyclin e, thereby disrupting the cyclin e/cdk <dig> timer  <cit> . the p27xic1ck- construct contains four point mutations in the cdk <dig> binding site that inhibit p27xic1/cdk <dig> interaction, thus serving as a negative control.

embryos expressing Δ34-xic <dig> were delayed slightly  compared to p27xic1ck- controls  but developed otherwise normally through the mbt. however, prior to gastrulation, embryos expressing Δ34-xic <dig> died by apoptosis, indicated by gross morphology  and activation of caspases . in contrast, embryos injected with p27xic1ck- protein persisted through gastrulation and neurulated . these data indicate that specific inhibition of cdk <dig> results in apoptosis in xenopus embryos.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that altering the balance of cdk tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity in early x. laevis embryos leads to apoptosis after the mbt. we initiated these experiments because our previous studies suggested chk1/chk <dig> kinases function as inhibitors of apoptosis in early x. laevis embryos  <cit> . expression of catalytically inactive, dominant-negative chk <dig> or chk <dig> in pre-mbt embryos induces apoptosis during early gastrulation  <cit> . furthermore, wild-type chk <dig> rescues embryos from radiation-induced apoptosis  <cit> . because exogenous chk <dig> lengthens cleavage cycles in a dose-dependent manner, one possible explanation for the protection from apoptosis was that longer cell cycles allowed time for repair of dna damage. if this were the case, then wee <dig>  which also lengthens cleavage cycles due to tyrosine phosphorylation of cdks, should also protect embryos from dna damage-induced apoptosis.

however, the studies reported here yielded unexpected results and valuable information regarding the role and regulation of cdk phosphorylation states in the early embryo. wee <dig> mrna lengthened cell cycles modestly, and until the mbt , embryos overexpressing wee <dig> were indistinguishable from those expressing low levels of exogenous chk <dig>  <cit> . both groups of embryos were delayed approximately one cell cycle when sibling controls reached the mbt. furthermore, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was similar in embryos expressing exogenous chk <dig> or wee <dig>  despite these similarities, embryos injected with wee <dig> mrna died by apoptosis in the absence of any further perturbation.

previous studies have implicated wee <dig> as an inhibitor of cdk <dig> activity in mammalian cells  <cit> , but wee <dig> had only been reported as a cdk <dig> kinase in x. laevis embryos. in this study, we demonstrated that wee <dig> delayed the degradation of cyclin e and phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  which functions as a developmental timer until the mbt. however, the catalytic activity of the total pool of cyclin e/cdk <dig> was not reduced and persisted in embryos overexpressing wee <dig>  consistent with the cell cycle delay and delayed degradation of cyclin e. therefore, like chk1/chk <dig>  wee <dig> causes tyrosine phosphoryation of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> in x. laevis embryos. nonetheless, despite similar effects on the cell cycle machinery, they have opposite effects regarding apoptosis in the embryo.

because we discovered wee <dig> to alter cdk <dig> phosphorylation as well as trigger apoptosis, we tested whether apoptosis could be induced by a more specific cdk <dig> inhibitor. a variant of xic <dig> lacking the first  <dig> amino acids  is a specific stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin e/cdk <dig>  <cit>  and delays both the degradaton of cyclin e and the onset of the mbt in x. laevis embryos  <cit> . in our studies, one hundred percent of embryos injected with exogenous Δ34-xic <dig> underwent apoptosis after the mbt . similarly, in breast cancer cells, transduction of a non-degradable form of the human homolog of xic <dig>  kip <dig>  induced cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. furthermore, exogenous kip <dig> caused an increase in the number of apoptotic cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
despite similar effects on development prior to the mbt, only wee <dig> and Δ34-xic <dig> induce apoptosis, whereas chk1/chk <dig> function as inhibitors of apoptosis. one possible explanation for this difference apparent in table  <dig> is the effect of these reagents on cdc25a levels at the mbt and consequently on the ratio of cdk kinases:phosphatases at the mbt. chk1/chk <dig> trigger the premature degradation of cdc25a before the mbt whereas wee <dig> and Δ34-xic <dig> delay the degradation of cdc25a. these data suggest that cdc25a may promote apoptosis and/or that a high cdk kinase:phosphatase ratio inhibits apoptosis. in support of the former, exogenous non-degradable cdc25a triggers cell death in the embryo during early gastrulation  <cit> . in support of the latter chk1/chk <dig> may activate wee <dig> in x. laevis, leading to an even higher cdk kinase:phosphatase level than would be achieved by the degradation of cdc25a alone  <cit> . alternatively, chk1/chk <dig> may block apoptosis by another pathway altogether, distinct from their effect on the cell cycle machinery. these studies illustrate that cell cycle remodeling events must be appropriately coordinated for the embryo to develop beyond the mbt. these studies also illustrate that cell cycle regulators that have been well characterized biochemically in vitro or in cell culture systems may have additional functions that can be uncovered in the rich context of the developing embryo.
