BACKGROUND
human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  has been demonstrated to damage the human immune system, finally leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , which is characterized by vulnerability to life-threatening opportunistic infections. the natural progression of hiv- <dig> consists of the acute stage, the clinical latency stage, and aids  <cit> . the acute stage , the first stage of hiv- <dig> infection, results from contamination with the hiv- <dig> virus through body fluids such as blood, semen, or vaginal fluid. in this stage, the copy number of hiv- <dig> virus rapidly increases, and the number of cd4+ t cells markedly decreases  <cit> . however, most patients with hiv- <dig> infection recover from the acute stage without treatment within  <dig> to  <dig> weeks and have a period of clinical latency of  <dig> to  <dig> years  <cit> . although there are no clinical manifestations and the cd4+ t-cell count is almost recovered during the clinical latency stage, it has been reported that immune damage persistently occurs  <cit> . among the hiv-infected population, approximately  <dig> to 8% of patients remain clinically stable for decades. they have been referred to as long-term non-progressors   <cit> . however, most patients undergo chronic progressive infection  that finally leads to aids, at which point the cd4+ t-cell count drops below  <dig> cells/μl, and t cell-mediated immunity fails to protect the body from pathogens.

several studies have attempted to reveal the mechanism of hiv- <dig> pathogenesis at the genomic level using microarray experiments. using analysis of differentially expressed genes  across hiv- <dig> infection stages, hyrcza et al. found that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is increased in the early and chronic progressive stages  <cit> . li et al., by a similar deg-based analysis using lymphatic tissue microarrays, showed that each stage has relatively different gene expression patterns  <cit> . these studies have enhanced our knowledge about the pathogenic mechanism of hiv- <dig>  one of the common limits of these studies, however, is that deg-based expression analysis cannot identify an hiv- <dig> stage-specific gene signature that can clearly discriminate pathophysiologically similar stages, such as between acute and chronic stages or between uninfected and non-progressive stages  <cit> .

recently, protein-interaction-based analyses with correlational designs have been successfully applied to discover a discriminant genetic signature for a specific condition, but not for an individual sample, using microarray analysis  <cit> . these analyses usually have different assigned weights for an interacting protein pair based on degrees of correlation of expression levels under specific conditions. genes or gene products do not work alone, but rather function in relationship with other genes or proteins in a real molecular setting  <cit> . moreover, the degree of correlation between members of an interacting protein pair under a specific condition might provide evidence for the degree of functional relationship under that condition. however, this approach requires multiple samples under a target condition to extract the genetic features for the condition; thus, it cannot be used for a genetic signature of a single sample, which is required to validate or test whether a new sample has a signature similar to those of other samples in a certain group.

here, we suggest a novel protein-interaction-based method to capture a genetic signature for a single sample under a specific condition. to achieve this purpose, we assigned a co-expression  score to a protein–protein interaction by comparing the expression-change ratios of the two genes in a sample with representative values. after assigning co-expression scores for each sample, we found differentially co-expressed interacting protein pairs  among conditions for a condition-specific signature. we applied the dep-based method to samples representing the clinical stages of hiv- <dig> infection to discover an hiv- <dig> stage-specific signature.

methods
acquisition of hiv-1-infected gene expressions and human protein–protein interactions
for hiv- <dig> expression data, we downloaded the series gse <dig> dataset from the geo database . the dataset contains stage-specific gene expressions of cd4+ and cd8+ cells from a cohort of hiv-infected individuals  <cit> . the hiv-infected individuals had not been treated at the time samples were obtained. the profiles of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from individuals with early hiv- <dig> infections , non-progressive hiv- <dig> infections with low or undetectable viral loads , chronic progressive hiv- <dig> infections , and uninfected individuals  were selected . the expression profiles were normalized using a quantile normalization method implemented in matlab r2009b  . final expression datasets contained  <dig> acute,  <dig> non-progressive,  <dig> chronic samples, and  <dig> uninfected samples. for human protein–protein interactions , we used the data of lee et al.  <cit> , which incorporated public databases such as dip  <cit> , bind  <cit> , hprd  <cit> , and reactome  <cit> . the data set also included the results of several recent genome-wide studies  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  <dig> interactions among  <dig>  <dig> human proteins were prepared. for the subsequent analyses, including calculating co-expression scores and identifying differentially co-expressed interacting protein pairs, only these interactions were considered.

calculating a co-expression score between two interacting gene products
a co-expression  score between two interacting gene products in a sample was calculated by following two steps . first, expression-changing ratios  of two genes, a and b, were defined as follows:  

where x  indicates the normalized expression level of gene a , and rx  is a representative expression level of gene a . in this study, the median value of expressions across samples was used as a representative value of a specific gene. next, a co-expression score  between the two interacting gene products in the sample was calculated using the following equation:  

where min  or max  indicates the minimum or maximum value between p and q, respectively, and sign  indicates the sign of x. note that the co-expression score ρ has a positive value if x and y are simultaneously greater  than rx and ry; otherwise, it has a negative value. moreover, the co-expression score ρ has a higher absolute value if the absolute values of expression-changing ratios are similar between the two genes.

identifying deps and degs
to identify deps for hiv- <dig> infection, analysis of variance  and geometric means of differences between median co-expression scores across individual stages were used . an interaction with a high value of -log <dig> ×  was considered significant, and interactions with higher degrees of significance than a specific cutoff value were selected as deps. a similar process was applied to select degs, except that expression levels, not co-expression scores, were used. to ensure a balanced comparison, the most highly significant degs were selected in a quantity equal to the number of genes. here, several values from  <dig>  to  <dig> were examined to identify the optimal cutoff value that provided the smallest number of deps and degs with the best accuracy.

pca, clustering, and classification analyses of deps and degs
to estimate how deps reveal hiv- <dig> stage-specific characteristics, principal-component analysis  and several well-known classification and clustering methods were used . pca transforms attribute values into new ones to create the linear projection of the data that accounts for the most variance in a low-dimensional subspace. therefore, it provides snapshots of data that we can see at a glance. global views of deps were compared with those of whole genes and degs using pca. pca was performed using the algorithm implemented in matlab, r2009b .

for clustering, we used hierarchical clustering  with the k-means methods implemented in mev <dig>    <cit> . the hcl method groups samples according to the degree of similarity between them based on feature information  without considering the class information . therefore, it was possible to confirm whether the selected feature information of samples  is valuable for clustering samples according to stage. k-means clustering, like hcl, is an unsupervised learning method. however, k-means clustering was used to partition deps  into some number of clusters. here, deps were clustered into six groups in each cell type . stage-specific clusters in both cd4+ and cd8+ cells were then further characterized through go term analysis.

for classification methods, we used the j <dig> decision tree, the smo support-vector machine, and the multilayer perception artificial neural network, which were implemented in weka, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . leave-one-out cross-validation  using these methods was applied to estimate the classification performance of selected deps  for predicting the disease stages of hiv- <dig>  loocv is one of the most popular validation methods; it trains prediction models using all samples except one and then tests the models with the remaining sample. this step then passes through as many iterations as there are samples  <cit> . for performance measures, we used accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity from a confusion matrix.

dep-based network-module identification
to discover hiv-related interaction sub-networks, the prepared ppis and the list of genes in deps were imported into cytoscape   <cit>  with the median co-expression score for each stage . next, we included the genes that directly interacted with the genes in deps. using the extended network, mcode was used to find sets of genes located at the area of dense deps . mcode is a cytoscape plug-in and is one of the most popular methods by which to find highly interconnected regions in a network  <cit> . the score of a sub-network was calculated based on the complexity and density of the network. the top  <dig> modules with the highest network scores were considered significant since modules with higher network scores showed higher prediction accuracies in previous study  <cit> . among  <dig> significant modules, five modules containing deps were finally selected because none of the other five modules included any dep. note that a dep in each sample has its own co-expression score. to find a representative hiv-related module under a specific stage, thus, we used a median value of multiple co-expression scores for an interaction and a median expression level for a protein, respectively.

gene-ontology enrichment analysis
for the gene list in deps and degs, a functional annotation tool called the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit>  was applied to find functionally enriched terms. david uses a fisher’s exact test to determine whether the proportion of selected genes falling into each category differs from the baseline . for selected modules, bingo   <cit>  was also used to conduct gene-ontology  enrichment analysis. bingo, which is implemented as a plug-in for cytoscape, maps the predominant functional themes of a given gene set on the go hierarchy and outputs this mapping as a cytoscape graph. hypergeometric distribution was adopted to find a functional degree of overrepresentation of an hiv-related module using this method.

RESULTS
identifying deps across hiv- <dig> stages
we prepared  <dig> acute,  <dig> non-progressive,  <dig> chronic samples, and  <dig> uninfected samples of cd4+ and cd8+ cells from a cohort of hiv-infected individuals . for human protein-protein interactions, we used the data of lee et al.  <cit> , which cover  <dig>  <dig> interactions among  <dig>  <dig> proteins. to identify deps, we first calculated a co-expression score of each interaction using expression-changing ratios of the corresponding two proteins. after that, we found significantly different pairs using analysis of variance  and geometric means of differences of median levels across hiv- <dig> stages. among  <dig>  <dig> interacting protein pairs,  <dig> pairs were selected as significant deps which consist of  <dig> proteins across hiv- <dig> infection . a deg-based analysis, on the other hand, selected a different set of  <dig> genes: only eight genes  were common to deps and degs. figures2a and 2b show some cases of the selected deps in which deps could differentiate between pathophysiologically similar hiv- <dig> stages. for example, the co-expression pattern, illustrated by the line in the figure, between hnrnpm  and dhx <dig>  box polypeptide  <dig>  known to be involved in the expression and nuclear export of retroviral rnas and also known to interact with hiv- <dig> rna) was positively related to the acute stage, whereas it was negatively related to chronic stage . however, a deg-based analysis missed the hiv- <dig> related proteins hnrnpm and dhx <dig> because of the similar median expression levels across the acute  and chronic  stages. a similar phenomenon was observed between lrrc <dig>  and siah <dig>  which were positive in uninfected but negative in non-progressive stages, whereas the median expression levels of lrrc <dig> and siah <dig> were similar between the two stages .

here, significance is “-log × g-mean”.

the functional characteristics were also significantly different between deps and degs . the number of enriched go terms using the  <dig> proteins of deps was  <dig>  whereas it was  <dig> in the case of degs . among the enriched go terms,  <dig> overlapped and were mainly associated with “translation” biological processes. thirty-six go terms included only in deps were related to responses against endogenous or exogenous stimuli . they were particularly associated with apoptosis , which is known to be an important factor in the progression of hiv by the resulting depletion of t helper cells  <cit> . on the other hand, the go terms only for degs included “response to virus” and “immune response”.

pca results of deps and degs of hiv-1
we applied pca to evaluate the geometric view of the samples in various hiv- <dig> stages with i) whole genes of the microarray, ii) the identified degs, or iii) the identified deps . in the case of whole genes , the four areas of samples in distinct hiv- <dig> stages highly overlapped one another with regard to the first three principal components, even though the samples were separable according to cell type . in the pca analysis with degs , the hiv- <dig> stages were still not separable; in particular, the uninfected and non-progressive areas and the acute and chronic areas were highly overlapped. when the identified deps were used , however, all four stages were clearly separable using the three components, regardless of cell type. interestingly, pathophysiologically similar hiv- <dig> stages, such as acute and chronic or uninfected and non-progressive, were highly discriminable using the first two principal components , although there was an area that overlapped between chronic and non-progressive. these four stages were clearly separable both in the first and third planes and in the second and third planes . this tendency was also observed in individual cell types, i.e., in cd4+ cells and cd8+ cells. the dep pca results showed the most clearly discriminated distribution of the samples across the hiv- <dig> stages compared with those of whole genes or degs regardless of cell type.

clustering results of deps in hiv-1
we applied clustering methods to the samples without seeing their hiv- <dig> stage information. when the extracted deg-based features were used for the individual cd4+ samples , the samples were mixed together across the different hiv- <dig> stages, especially between acute and chronic  and between non-progressive and uninfected . this indicates that chronic samples and acute samples have similar expression patterns, as do non-progressive and uninfected stages. when dep-based features were used with the same hierarchical clustering method, however, same-stage samples were clustered first . after grouping samples according to stage information, chronic and non-progressive samples were then clustered. finally, uninfected and acute were clustered in sequence. the heat maps of hierarchical clustering results showed that the co-expression patterns of each stage were quite different across the hiv- <dig> stages, whereas individual gene expression patterns lacked distinct patterns according to stage, especially between pathophysiologically similar hiv- <dig> stages . this tendency was also observed in cd8+ cells. moreover, the dep-based features clearly clustered each stage of hiv- <dig>  regardless of cell type. co-expression patterns of samples were preserved across individual hiv- <dig> stages.

to discover stage-specific co-expressed pairs, we next clustered the  <dig> identified deps into six groups using a k-means clustering method. different cell types might be associated with different dep groups; therefore, we identified separate clusters using only cd4+ samples or only cd8+ samples. of the six groups, four groups in each cell type showed stage-specific co-expression patterns. surprisingly, the median co-expression scores of groups across samples were quite similar between cd4+ and cd8+ cells. moreover, each pair of groups with a similar co-expression pattern shared many deps. using the deps shared between cd4+ and cd8+ cells, we analyzed enriched go terms . common biological functions of all four clusters were “rna splicing” and “mrna processing”. the first cluster, which was composed of  <dig> deps, had lower co-expression scores only in the uninfected stage. the genes of the  <dig> deps are known to play a major role in “transcription” in addition to the common functions. in contrast, the second cluster, which had  <dig> deps with lower co-expression scores only in the acute stage, was involved in “translation” rather than “transcription”. the genes in the seven deps of the third cluster, which had higher co-expression scores only in the non-progressive stages, are also known to play a role in “epigenetic processing”. major functions of the last cluster  were related to “repair processes” such as “cellular response to stress”, “response to radiation” and “dna repair”.

discriminant power of deps for hiv- <dig> stages
to directly investigate the discriminant power of deps for the hiv- <dig> stages, we compared the prediction performance of the identified deps with that of the degs using several well-known classification methods including a decision tree, a support vector machine, and an artificial neural network . we here used a loocv approach with several performance measures including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. as shown in figure5a, the prediction accuracies  of deps were much higher than those  of degs regardless of the classification method used. the better performance of deps was also observed with other measures including sensitivity and specificity . moreover, among the misclassification cases, the  <dig> % incorrect prediction  of the three models built with degs was caused by misclassification between acute and chronic or between uninfected and non-progressive . in the case of deps, however, the three models did not misclassify any case between these stages. the only two misclassified cases were misclassification of an uninfected sample as chronic and an acute sample as uninfected. the dep-based features correctly classified the pathophysiologically similar hiv- <dig> stage pairs.

next, we evaluated the influence of the number of deps  on the power for discriminating the hiv- <dig> stages. the performance was evaluated by a support-vector machine with various cutoff values for the degree of significance of deps from  <dig>  to  <dig> . here, as many degs were selected as there were dep genes. as shown in figure5d, the highest accuracy was achieved at values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . thus, in this study, we selected  <dig>  as the cutoff value for dep selection because it revealed the highest level of performance with a smaller number of deps and degs. as a result,  <dig> deps consisting of  <dig> genes and  <dig> degs were selected. additionally, we investigated the impact of the number of selected features from pca analysis with the selected deps and degs. in the pca analysis using the  <dig> degs, about  <dig> principal components were required to achieve the best performance . for the selected dep cases, however, only three principal components were required to obtain the best performance, which was the same accuracy as given by all components of pca using deps. this also suggests that dep-based features have meaningful discriminant information with respect to the hiv- <dig> stages.

discovery of hiv- <dig> stage-specific network modules using deps
from the selected deps, we discovered hiv- <dig> stage-specific network modules. in this analysis, we also included genes that directly interact with the genes in the deps to extend the genes in deps. the extended network had  <dig>  <dig> nodes representing genes, with  <dig>  <dig> edges between nodes denoting ppis including deps. using the extended network and an mcode method , we identified five hiv-1-related network modules across the hiv- <dig> stages . their network scores were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. genes and interactions that composed a network module were predefined in the module-searching phase, but each model of a specific hiv- <dig> infection stage had its own representative co-expression scores and expression levels. in network module  <dig>  for example, the co-expression score between cdc <dig> and mcm <dig> was negative only in the uninfected stage. additionally, the interactions between cdc <dig> and mcm <dig> had identical signs for the co-expression score in uninfected and chronic stages or in acute and non-progressive stages, respectively. in go enrichment analysis , all identified network modules were related to dna or rna metabolisms. more specifically, the main functional categories of the biological process of network modules  <dig> and  <dig> were “translation,” including “translational elongation,” “translation,” and “gene expression.” module  <dig> was related to “rna splicing,” including “nuclear mrna splicing,” “rna splicing via transesterification reactions,” and “mrna processing.” module  <dig> was related to “mrna, rna, and nucleic acid transport,” and module  <dig> was associated with “dna metabolism,” including “dna replication” and “dna metabolic process.” the hiv-related network modules revealed by network analysis using deps correspond with the results of some earlier studies . the proposed dep-based method, therefore, complemented the deg-based approach in the microarray expression analysis of hiv- <dig> infection.

discussion
the purpose of this study was to develop a novel microarray data analysis method to discover the stage-specific protein pairs in hiv- <dig> infection. the developed novel method focuses on the expression co-changing patterns between interacting protein pairs rather than on expression levels of individual genes. note that we here only considered known ppis that contact physically or chemically in selecting deps rather than all possible pairs among all detected genes in microarray; both because expressions noisy and because physically or chemically contacting pairs can share biological function and thus their biological meaning can be easily interpreted. strength of our method comparing existing correlation-based method is that it can capture a genetic signature for a single sample. even though one or more samples are used for selecting representative expression level, our method can identify a genetic signature for a new single sample by comparing with known representative expression level if those levels were already known by previous study.

with this method,  <dig> deps were selected for the discriminant features of hiv- <dig> stages. a comparison between deps and degs revealed that deps more powerfully classified the ambiguous stages of hiv- <dig>  this means that deps can provide additional information not included in degs. as shown in figure2a, for example, the hiv-1-related proteins hnrnpm  and dhx <dig>  had similar expression levels between acute and chronic stages even though the variations within individual stages were relatively large . thus, the previous deg-based approach missed both hnrnpm and dhx <dig> as the stage-specific genes for hiv- <dig>  however, if we consider an expression co-changing pattern, the hnrnpm and dhx <dig> pair selected a significant feature of the hiv- <dig> stages because the co-changing scores were consistently positive in acute samples but consistently negative in chronic samples. in this respect, the dep-based approach could well discriminate all four stages of hiv- <dig>  moreover, deps were enriched in more hiv-related go terms, such as “apoptosis”, which is strongly associated with the spectrum of the progression of hiv infection. additionally, there is distinct difference between the dep-based approach and previous correlation-based network analyses  <cit> . the biggest difference is that the dep-based approach generates a distinct feature set with only one sample, whereas a correlation-based network approach finds a network feature with groups of samples under a specific condition. thus, it is difficult to capture the characteristics of individual samples using the previous correlation-based network analyses. if there is a problem in predicting an unknown or new sample and if deg-based analysis is unclear, then the dep-based approach might be applicable.

the hiv-related network modules revealed by network analysis using deps correspond with the results of some earlier studies. heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins  in modules  <dig> and  <dig> are known as hiv protein-synthesis modulators  <cit> . in module  <dig>  sf3b <dig>  modulates viral proliferation of hiv through interaction with vpr   <cit> . sfrs <dig>  influences the use of the hiv- <dig> splicing site  <cit> . snrpe , one of the transcription elongation complexes, assembles with hiv tat  <cit> . dhx <dig>  box polypeptide 9) affects the expression of hiv- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, there is an association between pcf <dig>  and hiv- <dig> transcription <cit> . pcbp <dig>  binding protein 1) and ybx <dig>  interact with rev protein, a key regulator of hiv- <dig> gene expression  <cit> . nup <dig>  is related to rev-mediated viral rna export by interacting with eif-5a   <cit> . in contrast to nup <dig>  nup <dig>  is associated with the import of hiv dna  <cit> . all of these genes were included in deps but not in degs. from the module analysis with deps, it seems that changes in dna and rna metabolism are crucial in the clinical manifestations of hiv infection, and deps and hiv-related network modules might have the potential to assist in the elucidation of the pathogenesis of hiv- <dig> infection at the genomic and proteomic levels. however, further studies to seek biological confirmation are imperative to clarify the detailed roles of deps in specific hiv- <dig> stages.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a novel microarray data analysis method based on dep by focusing on the expression co-changing patterns between interaction pairs. the dep based algorithm was more powerful in classifying the ambiguous stages of hiv- <dig> and revealed the hiv- <dig> stage-specific network modules. the dep-based method might contribute to complementation of existing deg-based analyses.
