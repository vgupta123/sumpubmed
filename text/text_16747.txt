BACKGROUND
most mutations originate during dna replication. the divergence of nucleotide sequences should therefore be related to the number of germline cell divisions per unit of time rather than to time alone  <cit> . because the nucleotide substitution rate  is expressed per year, molecular clock should tick slower in taxonomic groups with long life-cycle length, although other factors may modify a clock’s rate .

in angiosperms, the number of cell divisions in the germline may differ among different species even if their life-cycle lengths were similar due to differences in plant development and reproduction. it might therefore be difficult to detect the relationship between life-cycle length and the rate of molecular clock in angiosperms. contradictory evidence was initially reported  but an extensive study employing related taxa differing in life-cycle lengths provided strong evidence supporting this relationship  <cit> .

another facet of genomic change is the erosion of synteny between the genomes of related species. synteny erosion is caused by the accumulation of duplications, deletions, inversions, translocations, and transpositions of chromosomal segments of various lengths or individual genes and their fragments. these structural changes perturb the sequence of genes along chromosomes. gene duplications and deletions, sometimes referred to as gene copy number variation, may lead to the evolution of new genes  <cit> . gene duplications and deletions and the evolution of new genes is an important evolutionary strategy in angiosperms  <cit> .

the rates of gene duplication and deletion were shown to vary extensively among lineages in the grass family and lead to variation in the number of genes in grass genomes  <cit> . the causes of this variation are unclear. genome size and the activity of transposable elements  were speculated to play roles . tes cause dna rearrangements  <cit>  and gene and gene fragment duplications . te transposition is often mobilized by dna replication  <cit> . we therefore hypothesize that the rates of synteny erosion, like those of the molecular clock, may depend on the life-cycle length. a report  <cit>  that synteny of the grape genome with that of the poplar, a long-lived woody perennial, is more conserved than with that of arabidopsis thaliana, a short-lived ephemeral herb, is consistent with this hypothesis.

to study this relationship, we quantify here synteny in the “nitrogen-fixing” clade and two related clades of angiosperms. the nitrogen-fixing clade includes orders fabales, rosales, cucurbitales, and fagales  <cit> . the clade contains both woody perennials and herbs with reference-quality genome sequences, facilitating the study of synteny. we selected among them the genome sequences of medicago truncatula   <cit> , apple    <cit> , strawberry    <cit> , and cucumber    <cit> . no species with a reference-quality genome sequence exists in fagales. previous studies demonstrated that in the absence of a reference quality genome sequence synteny can be effectively assessed using a dense comparative genetic map  <cit>  or comparative physical map  <cit> . we therefore develop here a comparative physical map for persian  walnut , a woody perennial economically important for nuts and timber. walnut belongs to the family juglandaceae. juglandaceae and seven other families make up the order fagales  <cit> .

fagales with the remaining orders of the nitrogen-fixing clade are members of the clade fabidae . fabidae and the sister clade malvidae  form the rosid clade, which contains about a quarter of all angiosperms  <cit> .

in addition to species of the nitrogen-fixing clade we include in our study the genomes of two more long-lived woody perennials, the grape  and poplar . a reference-quality genome sequence exists for both species  <cit> . poplar is a member of malpighiales, which is a sister clade of the nitrogen-fixing clade within fabidae  <cit>  or a clade of malvidae  <cit> . grape is a member of vitales, which is either a sister clade to fabidae and malvidae within rosids  <cit>  or is basal to the rosid clade .

the analysis of the v. vinifera genome sequence revealed a whole genome triplication   <cit> , which was estimated to have taken place about  <dig> million years  ago and was proposed to predate the radiation of the rosid clade  <cit> . because the grape genome does not reveal any other whole genome duplication  we use the grape genome as a baseline reference in the search for wgds. the γ triplication was reported to be detectable in the apple genome  <cit>  but no conclusive evidence for it was found in the strawberry genome  <cit> , even though apple and strawberry belong to the same family. two wgds were detected in the poplar genome  <cit> , one recent, named “salicoid”, and one more ancient. it is not entirely clear whether the older wgd corresponds to the γ triplication detected in the grape genome.

to initiate the construction of the walnut comparative physical map, we previously developed two libraries of bacterial artificial chromosome  clones for cv ‘chandler’, a clonally propagated heterozygous walnut cultivar, and sequenced one end of  <dig>  bac clones  <cit> . we filtered the bac-end sequences  for coding sequences , aligned cdbes with multiple walnut genome equivalents of chandler next generation sequence  reads, identified single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , and used them to design a 6 k infinium snp assay for walnut  <cit> .

here we deploy these resources in the construction of a walnut comparative physical map. because the walnut physical map contains only a subset of the total number of genes in the walnut genome, we limit the synteny comparisons to that subset and employ the walnut physical map in all genome comparisons. using this strategy, all synteny quantifications we make are comparable because they all use the same set of coding sequences.

RESULTS
genetic map
the standard approach to construct a bac-based physical map is to construct a dense genetic map, and used it as a backbone for anchoring and ordering on it bac contigs. we genotyped a walnut mapping population of 425 f <dig> trees from a cross of chandler with ‘idaho’, two heterozygous clonally propagated walnut scion cultivars, with the walnut 6 k infinium snp iselect assay  <cit> . only markers that segregated in chandler and were homozygous in idaho were used in the construction of the genetic map. the map was therefore a female-backcross map. we mapped  <dig>  snp markers  into  <dig> linkage groups  corresponding to the  <dig> walnut chromosomes . the lengths of the lgs ranged from  <dig>  cm for lg <dig> to  <dig>  cm for lg <dig> . the average length of a lg was  <dig>  cm and the total length of the genetic map was  <dig> .5 cm .table  <dig> characteristics of the walnut genetic and physical maps



physical map
we fingerprinted  <dig>  chandler bac clones with the snapshot high-information-content fingerprint  technology  <cit>  modified as described by gu et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  clones  contained usable fingerprints. after removing contaminated clones, clones with substandard fingerprints, and clones possessing small inserts, we used  <dig>  clone fingerprints  for contig assembly. the initial assembly resulted in  <dig> contigs containing  <dig>  bac clones . the remaining  <dig>  clones were singletons. the average contig length was  <dig>  mb, n50 =  <dig>  mb, and l50 =  <dig>  from the available  <dig>  chandler bes  <cit>   we selected cdbes  <cit> . we used the cdbes containing snp marker sequences for anchoring bac contigs onto the genetic map. we manually examined the consistency of the order of the markers along each bac contig and along the genetic map and edited problematic contigs. that usually meant manual disjoining of a problematic contig into two or more contigs. contig editing consequently increased the total number of bac contigs from  <dig> to  <dig>  . the average contig length and n <dig> length slightly decreased while l <dig> increased . of the  <dig>  edited contigs,  <dig> were anchored on the genetic map. we generated a contiguous sequence of consensus bands  across each bac contig with fpc  <cit>  and converted physical maps in terms of cb units into physical maps in terms of bp using the relationship  <dig> cb unit =  <dig>  kb, which we estimated with fpc. we estimated the total length of the physical map across the  <dig> anchored contigs to be  <dig>  mb, accounting for 77 % of the total contig length. the unanchored 23 % of the genome were short bac contigs .table  <dig> bac contig statistics before and after manual editing



chandler is a heterozygous clone, and in some contigs fpc assembled the two chandler haplotypes separately, nesting one contig into another. the merodiploidy of the physical map would double the length of the map in those regions and would create artifacts in map applications. we therefore removed the shorter of the nested contigs from the physical map . a total of  <dig> nested contigs were removed, which reduced the number of anchored contigs from  <dig> to  <dig> and the length of the physical map from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb , shortening it by  <dig>  %. although the physical maps contained  <dig> gaps between contigs, the map contains a large portion of the genome as suggested by the fact that the estimated total length of the physical map anchored on the genetic map, about  <dig>  mb, was close to the estimated size of the walnut genome, 606 mb .

a total of  <dig>  bac clones in the  <dig> contigs contained cdbes, which we annotated . the cdbes are listed in column e  of the excel table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  we determined the beginning of each bac clone containing a cdbes on the cb map of each contig. the sequence  of these cdbes along the bac contigs and along each of the  <dig> walnut chromosomes, disregarding the gaps between contigs, generated a comparative physical map of each walnut chromosome.

since each physical map was anchored on a linkage map, the physical maps jr <dig> to jr <dig> corresponded to lg <dig> to lg <dig>  because only a single end of a bac clone was sequenced  <cit> , only a single cdbes could be present in a bac clone. since we did not know at which end of a bac clone the cdbes was located, ordering of cdbes along the physical map had an error of the length of one bac clone,  <dig> to 200 kb. for this reason, and the inadvertent anchoring of bac clones on the genetic map with paralogous genes, the order of neighboring markers on the genetic map  was occasionally inverted on the physical map . the numbers of cdbes per physical map ranged from  <dig> along physical map jr <dig> to  <dig>  along physical map jr <dig> .

recombination rates along walnut chromosomes
using a sliding window of 5 mb, we computed recombination rates, expressed as cm/mb, for  <dig> of the  <dig> walnut physical maps; that of jr <dig> was too short  for a meaningful assessment of recombination rates. recombination rates were highest in the subterminal regions. the average of these local maxima was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm/mb . a graph illustrating recombination rates along physical map jr <dig> is shown in fig. 1; graphs for all physical maps except for that of jr <dig> are in additional file  <dig>  all  <dig> investigated physical maps had a single global minimum with an average recombination rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm/mb.fig.  <dig> recombination rates along chromosome jr <dig>  the horizontal axis is the physical map in mb of jr <dig> and the vertical axis is recombination rate in cm/mb. the horizontal bar marks the location of a gap in synteny between the jr <dig> physical map and the grape, poplar, apple, cucumber, medicago truncatula, and strawberry pseudomolecules. we suggest that the collocation of the recombination rate global minimum and the synteny gap marks the jr <dig> centromeric region



synteny and its quantification
we searched for homology between the  <dig>  cdbes ordered along the  <dig> walnut  physical maps and genes on the grape , poplar , apple , m. truncatula , cucumber , and strawberry  pseudomolecules, recording separately the locations of genes with the highest and second-highest homology in the pseudomolecules . in each comparison of a physical map with a pseudomolecule, we determined the beginning and end of a block of collinear genes, which we termed a synteny block . we recorded cdbes that were collinear within a sb and used color coding to distinguish collinear genes from those that were not collinear .

the total number of sbs detected ranged from  <dig> in the jr-fv comparison to  <dig> in the jr-pt comparison . the number of sbs per pseudomolecule was the highest in the comparisons involving mt, cs, and fv, the species with the smallest numbers of chromosomes .table  <dig> quantification of synteny involving  <dig>  cdbes on the physical maps of the  <dig> juglans regia chromosomes and the pseudomolecules of vitis vinifera , populus trichocarpa , malus domestica , medicago truncatula , cucumis sativus , and fragaria vesca 


ameans in rows followed by the same letters are not statistically different at the 5 % probability level



the mean number of collinear cdbes per sb was  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the jr-vv and jr-pt comparisons, respectively. in three other genome comparisons, jr-md, jr-mt, and jr-cs, the mean numbers of collinear genes per sb were smaller, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , indicating that sbs were shorter and contained fewer collinear genes in the jr-md, jr-mt, and jr-cs genome comparisons than in the jr-vv and jr-pt comparisons. the comparison involving fv was not significantly different from either group.

the most revealing was the percentage of the collinear cdbes of the total number investigated in a genome comparison. in the jr-pt and jr-vv comparisons,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of all homologous genes detected in the pt and vv genomes were in collinear positions, respectively . in the remaining four comparisons, the percentages of collinear genes were significantly lower:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the cdbes in the jr-md, jr-mt, jr-cs, and jr-fv comparisons, respectively.

we illustrate these quantitative differences between the two groups of genome comparisons graphically in fig.  <dig>  sbs are shorter and more fragmented and regions devoid of synteny are longer in the jr-mt, jr-cs, and jr-fv comparisons than in the jr-vv and jr-pt comparisons. sbs in the jr-md comparison are intermediate between the two groups.fig.  <dig> synteny of walnut physical maps with the grape , poplar , apple , medicago truncatula , cucumber , and strawberry  pseudomolecules. the  <dig> walnut physical maps are arranged as  <dig> pairs of homoeologues. each physical map starts  at the top. the color code for pseudomolecules is shown at the right side of each panel. the regions devoid of synteny are white and labeled as a  <dig> pseudomolecule in the color code. only the primary sbs are shown in the jr-vv  and jr-fv  genome comparison for the sake of clarity. in the remaining comparisons both the primary and secondary sbs  are shown as two tracks. their placement into the left or right track is arbitrary



locations of walnut centromeres
the comparison of the jr physical maps with the vv, pt, md, mt, cs, and fv pseudomolecules revealed the existence of a region in each physical map that was devoid of synteny across all six genome comparisons. without exception, these gaps in synteny coincided with global minima in recombination rates . we suggest that these are centromeric regions of the jr chromosomes .

wgd
the number of sbs is expected to double in a genome comparison if a wgd has taken place in one of the compared genomes. if compared genomes are arranged as they are in the excel table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the cdbes arranged sequentially along the walnut physical maps from jr <dig> to jr <dig> on the vertical axis and pseudomolecules arranged one by one on the horizontal axis, a single walnut physical map is expected to be simultaneously syntenic with two pseudomolecules or their sections in the vv, pt, md, mt, cs, and fv genomes if any of these genomes harbors a wgd. as illustrated in the upper panel in fig.  <dig>  such a wgd manifests itself graphically as parallel sbs. if a wgd has taken place during evolution of the walnut genome, two different walnut physical maps are expected to be syntenic with the same pseudomolecule or its portion in each of the vv, pt, md, mt, cs, and fv genomes. as illustrated in the lower panel in fig.  <dig>  such a wgd manifests itself graphically as the same sb being duplicated in two different jr physical maps. we encountered both patterns.fig.  <dig> outcomes of synteny analysis involving species with a wgd. synteny is analyzed between hypothetical species a and b with a basic chromosome number of x =  <dig>  the physical maps of species a and pseudomolecules of species b are arranged as in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  each vertical bar is a sb of homologous genes collinear in the genomes of species a and b. if a wgd has taken place in species b but not in species a, there are two pseudomolecules  of species b that are syntenic with a single physical map  of species a . if a wgd has taken place in species a but not in species b, there are two physical maps of species a  that are syntenic with the same pseudomolecule  in species b 



we sometimes observed two and in some cases three parallel sbs in the genome comparisons and arbitrarily named the longest sb as primary, shorter as secondary, and the shortest as tertiary. we measured the lengths of sbs in terms of the walnut physical map lengths in all genome comparisons and hence the lengths of sbs were comparable across all genome comparisons. the total length of the  <dig> walnut physical maps was  <dig>  mb . the total length of the jr-vv primary sbs was  <dig>  mb , that of the secondary sbs was  <dig>  mb , and that of tertiary sbs was  <dig>  mb  . the existence of three parallel sbs in the jr-vv genome comparison was consistent with the γ triplication in the vv genome lineage  <cit> .table  <dig> the lengths of the primary, secondary, and tertiary sbs in the comparison of  <dig> juglans regia  chromosomes  with the pseudomolecules of vitis vinifera , populus trichocarpa , malus domestica , medicago truncatula , cucumis sativus , and fragaria vesca 


ameans in rows followed by the same letter were not significantly different at the 5 % probability level. bstatistical significance of differences between means was not tested because of large numbers of zeroes



for reasons pointed out earlier we used the jr-vv comparison as a baseline reference in search for wgds in the remaining genomes. the total length of the primary sbs in the jr-pt and jr-md genome comparisons did not significantly differ from that in the jr-vv comparison but was significantly shorter in the jr-mt, jr-cs, and jr-fv genome comparisons . like the percentage of collinear genes earlier, this measure showed that synteny of the jr genome with genomes of herbs, cs, mt, and fv, was more eroded than synteny of the jr genome with the genomes of woody perennials, vv, pt, and md . the secondary sbs were significantly shorter in the jr-vv, jr-mt, jr-cs, and jr-fv genome comparisons than in the jr-pt and jr-md genome comparisons . except for the jr-vv genome comparison, the absolute lengths of the primary and secondary sbs were related within individual genome comparisons and depended on the overall level of synteny erosion. we therefore used the ratio of secondary to primary  sb lengths as measure of sb duplication. we used the s/p sb ratio in the jr-vv genome comparison as a benchmark to test for the presence of a wgd in other genome comparisons.

the s/p sb ratio was  <dig>  in the jr-vv comparison but  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the jr-pt, jr-md, jr-mt, and jr-cs comparisons, respectively . thus, relative to the length of the primary sbs the lengths of the secondary sbs were longer in the jr-pt, jr-md, jr-mt, and jr-cs comparisons than in the jr-vv comparison. we therefore concluded that, in addition to the γ triplication, which is presumably present in these four lineages, a more recent wgd occurred in each of these lineages. the jr-fv comparison was exceptional since only two secondary and no tertiary sbs were detected. the s/p sb ratio was  <dig>  reflecting the extremely short length of the secondary sbs in the fv genome and indicating that no recent wgd occurred in the fv lineage.

in each genome comparison, we recorded the most similar and the second-most similar homologous gene to a walnut cdbes separately . in duplicated regions, the two types of homologous genes alternated along the primary and secondary sbs in each of the jr-pt, jr-md, jr-mt, and jr-cs genome comparisons , which indicated that the primary and secondary sbs were overall equidistant to the corresponding section of the jr physical map. furthermore, these patterns were dissimilar among the comparisons , which indicated that the wgds in the pt, md, mt, and cs lineages occurred after the lineages had diverged from the jr lineage and each was an independent wgd event.

we used the following procedure to determine whether a wgd occurred in the jr lineage. for each sb identified in the jr-vv genome comparison, we determined if there was a duplicated sb on another walnut chromosome, as illustrated in the bottom panel of fig.  <dig>  to quantify the length of the duplication, we counted the numbers of collinear cdbes in the duplicated sbs. of  <dig>  collinear cdbes in the jr-vv comparison,  <dig>  % were located in sbs duplicated on different jr chromosomes. we performed a similar analysis using sbs based on the jr-pt genome comparison. in that analysis,  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  collinear cdbes were located in sbs duplicated on different jr chromosomes. both sets of data suggested that a wgd occurred in the jr lineage.

for  <dig> of the  <dig> jr chromosomes, we always found one other jr chromosome that contained most of the duplicated sbs . we suggest that these pairs of chromosomes are ancient homoeologues. these homoeologous relationships were reciprocal. for example, when jr <dig> was used as a query, the highest percentage  of collinear cdbess in the jr-vv comparison was located in the sbs duplicated in jr <dig> . when jr <dig> was used as a query, the highest percentage  of collinear cdbess was located in sbs duplicated in jr <dig>  except for a single pair , the same strong reciprocal relationships were observed in other homoeologous chromosome pairs . in the jr6-jr <dig> pair the relationships were not reciprocal. when jr <dig> was used as a query, the corresponding chromosome was jr <dig> using both the jr-vv and jr-pt sbs. however, when jr <dig> was used as a query, other chromosomes contained greater numbers of collinear cdbes located in duplicated sbs other than jr <dig>  we suggest that this lack of reciprocity was caused by the short length of chromosome jr <dig> . with the sole exception of this chromosome pair, the remaining walnut chromosomes showed clearly defined homoeologous relationships .table  <dig> pairs of walnut homoeologous chromosomes and predicted structure of the eight ancestral chromosomes in terms of jr-vv sbs


athe tips of the short arms are to the left


bsbs in parentheses were present in only one of the two jr homoeologues but were not detected anywhere else in the genome, and we therefore assumed to be deleted from the other homoeologue



the presence of duplicated sbs in homoeologous chromosomes is evident in fig.  <dig>  in which the order of the jr chromosomes was arranged so that the homoeologous chromosomes are side-by-side. the homoeologous relationships are the most clearly apparent in the jr-vv genome comparison. the same primary sbs and in the same order are usually conserved within homoeologous chromosome pairs, although chromosomes jr <dig> and jr <dig> have to be inverted to be parallel to their homoeologues, jr <dig> and jr <dig>  respectively. while the order of sbs tends to be conserved, the lengths of corresponding sbs relative to each other vary greatly in homoeologous pairs .

we also constructed a global dot plot of jr physical maps with the vv pseudomolcules  and circular plots of each putative jr homoeologous chromosome pair with the pseudomolecules of relevant vv chromosomes  to illustrate the wgd in the walnut genome. the dot plot confirms most of the homoeologous relationships inferred in additional file  <dig> and shown in fig. 2a as well as relationships between jr and vv chromosomes summarized in fig. 2a. nevertheless, the great fragmentation and diffused nature of sbs makes the dot plot of limited value for revealing intra-genomic synteny in the walnut genome. the circular graphs  illustrate the relationships more clearly than the dot plot and capture some of the duplicated sbs lost in data filtering during the construction of the dot plot. bundles of lines connecting homologous jr and vv genes and emanating from vv pseudomolecules usually bifurcate and clearly show that sbs are duplicated in the jr genome. they also show that the sequence of duplicated sbs is often similar in putative jr homoeologues. we used the information we had on sharing of jr-vv sbs by the jr homoeologous chromosome pairs to suggest the composition of the eight chromosomes in the genome of the diploid ancestor of jr.fig.  <dig> a dot plot of the  <dig> walnut physical maps on the vertical axis, with the starting nucleotide of each physical map at the top, and the  <dig> grape pseudomolecules on the horizontal axis, with the staring nucleotide on the left. each dot represents a collinear gene pair identified by mcscanx between walnut and grape. different colors of dots represent different collinear blocks of genes

ks estimation
to assess the rate of nucleotide substitution at silent sites in the walnut lineage we searched for syntelogs in the walnut genome using the following criteria: cdbes had to contain exonic sequences, be present in duplicated sbs in the walnut genome, and both be collinear with a homologous gene in the vv or pt genome. we analyzed  <dig> syntelogs but only in  <dig> were the same exons present in the bes. we computed ks for each of the  <dig> pairs and plotted the values. based on the plot  we eliminated a single high outlying value. none of the remaining  <dig> genes were annotated as a transposable element . using these  <dig> gene pairs we obtained ks =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nucleotide substitution per silent site .fig.  <dig> frequencies of ks values among  <dig> pairs of walnut syntelogs



discussion
recombination rates and the maps
the average length of the walnut lgs was  <dig>  cm, and all lgs were short, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm, suggesting that a short lg length was a global property of the walnut genome. the genetic map was built from  <dig>  snp markers, and it is therefore unlikely that insufficient marker coverage was the cause of short lgs. the map was de facto a female backcross map, and it is possible that a low recombination rate in the female was the cause of short lgs, since sex-related differences in map lengths are common in plants .

short lgs have been reported in other woody perennials, such as the apple and pear , the grape  <cit> , and the oak, quercus robur,  <cit> . it is therefore also possible that low recombination rates are part of the reproductive strategy of woody perennials. pericentromeric regions of jr chromosomes showed low recombination rates and most of the recombination took place in the subterminal regions of the chromosomes. distal localization of recombination and overall short genetic lengths of chromosomes are adaptations attributed to high levels of outcrossing .

it is also possible that the low recombination rates in the walnut, apple, pear, grape, and oak genomes are an adjustment of recombination to the high numbers of chromosomes in those genomes. the walnut genetic map was produced with a similar number of genetic markers as the genetic map of aegilops tauschii, an inbreeding grass species with a relatively high level of recombination per chromosome but with only  <dig> chromosomes. the total length of the  <dig> walnut lgs was  <dig> .5 cm and the total length of the  <dig> ae. tauschii lgs was 10 % longer, at  <dig> .8 cm  <cit> . the large number of chromosomes in the walnut genome offsets the low recombination in individual walnut chromosomes.

we deployed in this study only snps discovered in chandler, which increased the likelihood of bac anchoring on the genetic map and facilitated the construction of the physical map. the variety ‘payne’ is a shared ancestor of both parents of chandler. neglecting the potential inbreeding of payne, the chandler inbreeding coefficient f was estimated as  <dig> . hence, at least  <dig>  % of the chandler genes are expected to be autozygous, and autozygous gene blocks would be devoid of snps. such regions of the genome could not be genetically mapped and would appear as gaps on the genetic map. they would not affect the length of the genetic map if they were located interstitially because crossovers taking place in homozygous regions result in recombination of heterozygous flanking markers. gaps located terminally may however escape detection because there is no flanking marker on the distal end of a gap to reflect crossovers in the homozygous region. a terminally located autozygous region will therefore reduce the genetic map length, and could be a factor shortening the lengths of specific walnut lgs. this possibility is relevant to the very short lg <dig> 

to assess empirically the seriousness of autozygosity for the walnut genetic map, we again compared it with the ae. tauschii genetic map. the ae. tauschii mapping population was produced by crossing parents from different subspecies and there was little chance for autozygosity in that population  <cit> . each ae. tauschii gap was divided by  <dig>  to take into account longer ae. tauschii lgs. the longest gap on the ae. tauschii map scaled to be comparable to the gaps on the walnut map equaled to  <dig>  cm. there were ten gaps longer than  <dig>  cm on the walnut genetic map , indicating that gaps were indeed longer on the walnut genetic map than on a map based on a population in which autozygosity was not a factor. the total length of the  <dig> gaps was  <dig>  cm . because these gaps were in regions with high recombination rates, they were physically relatively short, totaling  <dig>  mb . the combined effects of the interstitial and terminal gaps on the utility of the physical map were therefore probably minor. this is also suggested by the fact that the estimated total length of the physical map anchored on the genetic map, about 736 mb, was close to the estimated size of the walnut genome, 606 mb .

wgd
whole genome duplications, in addition to the γ triplication detected in vv  <cit> , have been previously reported in the pt  <cit> , md  <cit> , mt  <cit> , and cs  <cit>  genomes. we confirmed each of these events and uncovered a wgd in the jr genome. we assigned the  <dig> jr chromosomes into  <dig> pairs of putative homoeologues, which, except for the jr6-jr <dig> pair, usually showed the same sbs often arranged in the same order. it was suggested that the γ triplication generated a genome with n =  <dig>  <cit> . the eight homoeologous chromosome pairs in the haploid jr genome suggests that n =  <dig> did not evolve from n =  <dig> by dysploid reduction but from n =  <dig> by wgd. except for genera cyclocarya and platycarya, the rest of juglandaceae share n =  <dig>  <cit> . in cyclocarya, n =  <dig> is probably another round of wgd. although different counts, n =  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  have been reported for platycaya strobilacea , the fact that all of them are lower than n =  <dig> suggests that the actual chromosome number is less than  <dig>  the presence of n =  <dig> in both subfamilies of juglandaceae, juglandoidae and engelhardioidae  <cit> , leaves little doubt that n =  <dig> is the ancestral state in juglandaceae and the chromosome number in platycarya strobilacea was derived from n =  <dig> by dysploid reduction.

the most parsimonious model of chromosome number evolution in juglandaceae is the wgd preceding the radiation of the juglandaceae. otherwise, we would have to assume that a wgd happened independently in each of the lineages within the family and was always accompanied by the extinction of the diploid ancestor, which is unlikely. our hypothesis that the ancestral state was x =  <dig> is supported by the presence of n =  <dig> in the monotypic genus roiptelea  <cit> , which contains a single species r. chiliantha. roiptelea has been considered a monotypic family of fagales and the sister clade of juglandaceae  <cit> . it was recently transferred into the family juglandaceae , reflecting the close affinity to juglandaceae. chromosome number n =  <dig> is also present in myricaceae  <cit> , which also is closely related to juglandaceae  <cit> . since the fossil record places the radiation of juglandaceae to the paleocene  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig> mya, the wgd very likely happened in this time window. we propose to name this wgd as the “juglandoid” wgd.

timing the juglandoid wgd to about  <dig> mya adds one more wgd to a growing number of wgds that have occurred near the cretaceous-tertiary  boundary, about  <dig> mya  <cit> . the clustering of wgd events at the k-t boundary has been attributed to a greater ability of polyploids to survive the adverse environmental conditions and mass extinction associated with the k-t boundary  <cit> , although, as pointed out  <cit> , other factors may have played a role.

polyploidy-dysploidy  cycles
the juglandoid wgd duplicated an ancestral genome with x =  <dig> into a genome with n =  <dig>  in the following  <dig> my, the size of jr <dig> has been reduced. in the jr karyotype, jr <dig> is a small telocentric chromosome  <cit> . the analysis of its homoeologue, jr <dig>  suggested that a large portion  of jr <dig> may have been deleted. an actual dysploid reduction has taken place in platycarya strobilacea, from n =  <dig> to either n =  <dig> or n =  <dig> 

similar dysploid reductions have taken place in the poplar and apple lineages. in the former lineage, the salicoid wgd that originated about  <dig> mya duplicated a genome with x =  <dig> and produced a genome with n =  <dig>  this number of chromosomes was reduced to n =  <dig>  <cit> , which is widespread in salicaceae , in which poplar is classified. malus is a member of tribe pyreae of the rosaceae. pyreae have uniformly n =  <dig>  this chromosome number originated by a wgd which doubled a genome with x =  <dig>  the resulting n =  <dig> was reduced by dysploidy to n =  <dig>  <cit> . strawberry x =  <dig> very likely evolved from x =  <dig>  <cit> .

in each of these p-d cycles, the dysploid phase resulted in a reduction in chromosome number, never in an increase. a similar trend exists in grasses. in the lineages in which the availability of genomic data allowed thorough analysis of p-d cycles, the dysploid phase always resulted in a reduction in chromosome number, never in its increase  <cit> . we cannot offer an explanation of this tendency except for suggesting that processes increasing the numbers of bibrachial chromosomes are inherently more complex, and therefore less likely to take place, than those reducing them  <cit> .

the rates of dysploid reduction in the walnut, poplar, and apple p-d cycles are puzzling. if the ancestral genome of rosids indeed had n =  <dig> as suggested by salse  <cit> , the rate of dysploid reduction had to be precipitous in the  <dig> my preceding the wgds in the walnut, apple, and poplar lineages, which were timed to  <dig> ,  <dig>  <cit> , and  <dig>  <cit>  mya, respectively, to generate x =  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that preceded the wgds in these lineages, respectively. in the  <dig> my following the wgds, either none or only one or few chromosomes were eliminated by dysploidy in each lineage. we can offer no explanation of this glaring discrepancy in the rates of dysploid reduction.

nucleotide substitution rates
we concluded that the juglandoid wgd preceded or occurred at the time of the radiation of juglandaceae, which based on the fossil record radiated in the paleoceae  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig> mya. using a midpoint of  <dig> mya and our estimate of ks =  <dig> , we obtained the nucleotide substitution rate r =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> nucleotide year− <dig> for the walnut lineage. this rate is  <dig>  times slower than r =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> nucleotide year− <dig> reported for the arabidopsis lineage  <cit>  and  <dig>  times slower than r =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> nucleotide year− <dig> reported for the mt lineage  <cit>  but is very similar to the rates inferred for palms,  <dig>  × 10− <dig> nucleotide year− <dig>  <cit>  and a similar rate for the poplar  <cit> . the fact that our estimate of r for woody perennials in fagales is close to those of other woody perennials is consistent with the hypothesis that the molecular clock in plants is related to the life-cycle length  <cit>  and ticks more slowly in long-lived woody perennials than in short-lived herbs.

synteny erosion rate
synteny of the jr genome with genomes of short-lived herbs, mt, cs, and fv, was more eroded than synteny of the jr genome with the genomes of long-lived woody perennials, vv and pt. we did not include a. thaliana in our study, because synteny of its genome with that of the grape genome has already been shown to be more eroded than synteny between the genomes of the grape and poplar, two woody perennials  <cit> . synteny of jr with the md genome was intermediate between the two groups, although md is a woody perennial. rosaceae are a mixture of long-lived woody perennials and short-lived herbs and it is possible that the apple evolutionary lineage included or was preceded by species with intermediate life-cycles. even in rosaceae, however, the relationship between the life-cycle length and synteny erosion holds since synteny of fv, an herb, with jr was more eroded than that of md, long-lived woody perennial. while 19 % of cdbes were collinear in the jr-md genome comparison, only  <dig>  % were collinear in the jr-fv genome comparison. the greater erosion of synteny in the fv than in md genome may account for the failure to detect the γ triplication in the fv genome  and its detection in the more slowly evolving apple genome  <cit> . while in the jr-vv and jr-pt comparisons  <dig>  and  <dig>  % genes were in collinear locations, only  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % genes were in collinear locations in the jr-md, jr-mt, jr-cs, and jr-fv genome comparisons, although phylogenetically the md, mt, cs, and fv genomes are more closely related to the jr genome than to the vv and pt genomes .

is it possible that some other factor rather than the life-cycle length was responsible for the differences in synteny erosion with the walnut genome among the six investigated genomes? in theory, a wgd could accelerate synteny erosion by reducing the strength of purifying selection acting on individual genes. recent wgds took place in the pt, md, mt, and cs lineages but not in the vv and fv lineages. yet, the rates of synteny erosion in the vv and fv lineages greatly differ. additionally, genome erosion is faster in the fv lineage, which is devoid of wgd, than in the md lineage, in which a wgd took place. thus, wgd do not seem to have strong effects on the rate of synteny erosion. it is possible that the rate of synteny erosion and the rate of molecular clock are indirectly related to life-cycle length and more directly related to the average life expectancy or some other demographic or developmental factor that is correlated with life-cycle length in angiosperms.

CONCLUSIONS
compared to short-lived herbs, long-lived woody perennials show slow rates of nucleotide substitution and slow rates of synteny erosion. slow rates of molecular clock and slow rates of synteny erosion in long-lived angiosperms may be manifested in other facets of genome divergence. chromosome pairing and recombination in interspecific hybrids is one example  <cit> . reproductive isolation between species, which of all angiosperm life-forms is the weakest between woody perennials  <cit> , is another.
