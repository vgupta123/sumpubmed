BACKGROUND
leprosy has been known since the earliest recorded times, with references in ancient texts  <cit>  and paleopathological evidence in the archaeological record dating back at least 4000 years  <cit> . in britain, evidence for leprosy has been recorded from as early as the 4th century ad  <cit>  but is thought to have been particularly prevalent between the 11th and 14th centuries, as evidenced by a rise in the number of active leprosy hospitals known as leprosaria <cit> . however, by the end of this period, leprosy was declining such that leprosaria were being abandoned or put to other uses. firstly in southern britain but later in regions further to the north, until by the 18th century leprosy was only recorded in the far northern isles of shetland, the last sufferer dying in the edinburgh infirmary in  <dig>  <cit> . this decline in the prevalence of leprosy was reflected throughout europe and remains an intriguing feature of infectious disease history for which there is no clear reason. although leprosy is now rare in europe, it remains a significant disease in many parts of the world with approximately  <dig>  new cases in  <dig>  <cit> . despite the use of multi-drug therapy against leprosy since the 1980s, the prevalence of the disease remains stubbornly high in many areas. a wider understanding of the origins and history of leprosy, including why leprosy died out in europe, may help to develop more effective strategies for controlling the modern disease.

leprosy genomes show an unusual degree of conservation with strains being > <dig> % identical. only  <dig> polymorphic sites are recorded across all known strains  <cit> , most of which are single nucleotide polymorphisms , with some variable nucleotide tandem repeats   <cit> . this is despite the presence of more than  <dig> pseudogenes, equating to 41% of the genome  <cit> . a subset of these polymorphic loci were used to develop a molecular typing scheme and to generate a phylogeny for m. leprae. this predicted an ancestral strain, thought to have a genotype between that of modern type  <dig> and type  <dig> strains, originating in east africa approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . from there, leprosy appeared to have disseminated across the world along routes of human migration and trade, with type  <dig> strains dominating in southeast asia, type 3 s in the near east and europe, type 3is in northwestern europe and ultimately in north america and type 4 s in west africa and later brazil  <cit> . recently, new data have challenged this interpretation, with an apparently more basal group, type  <dig>  being identified in patients from china and new caledonia  <cit> .

in an effort to build a more comprehensive and accurate history for leprosy that better informs our understanding of its origins and macroecology, we and others have been studying dna from ancient m. leprae infections. leprosy is unusual in that multibacillary infection causes pathological changes of the bone, such that ancient infections can be retrospectively identified from skeletal remains. using snp typing and whole genome sequencing of dna from such lesions, we have recently been able to re-assess the genetic history of leprosy and demonstrate that 1000 years ago european leprosy was caused by strains that group with type  <dig> and type  <dig> strains  <cit>  and that a most recent common ancestor of all extant and ancient m. leprae existed only  <dig> to 2700 years ago  <cit> .

in this study we extend this work to gain further insights into the molecular epidemiology of european medieval leprosy. by sequencing the genomes of two further m. leprae strains from individuals interred at the leprosarium of st mary magdalen, winchester, england, during the second half of the 11th century we can begin to understand in more detail the epidemiology of m. leprae at this site  <cit> .

RESULTS
archaeology and osteology
excavations at st mary magdalen, winchester, are amongst the most extensive of any british leprosy hospital to date  <cit> . the hospital is one of the earliest such institutions known in britain and, as such, provides insights into both early institutional care and the nature and status of such communities at a relatively early date. such hospitals may well have been a model for succeeding charitable institutions of social care. thirty-eight burials have been excavated from the site, of which  <dig>  show osteological signs of leprosy, a much higher percentage than observed in other british material. of these, five m. leprae strains have been snp genotyped   <cit>  and  <dig> whole genomes  sequenced  <cit> .

the current study focuses on typing a further burial, sk <dig>  and generating whole genome sequences of the m. leprae from both sk <dig> and sk <dig>  both were excavated from the earlier and more northern of two cemeteries at the site . based upon comparative and diagnostic material this cemetery was thought to have been in use primarily in the decades immediately following the norman conquest, between 1070 ad and 1100 ad. this interpretation was confirmed by 14c dating, with dates of between 940 cal ad and 1160 cal ad  <cit> . sk <dig> and sk <dig> were 14c dated to between 955–1033 cal ad  and 1020–1162 cal ad , respectively.

the remains of sk <dig> are those of an adolescent, probably male, displaying clear pathological features of leprosy: circumferential wasting of the foot phalanges, loss of bone of the distal ends of the distal foot phalanges, porosity of the shafts of the metatarsals and porous, woven and compact bone on the shafts of the fibulae, thinning of the palate and nasal bones and rounding of the margins of the nasal aperture  <cit> . in contrast, sk <dig> was a middle-aged adult, with only minimal evidence of characteristic leprosy lesions. indeed, sk <dig> was originally identified as a possible control, non-lepromatous skeleton and only on closer examination was porosity and resorption of bone noted on the dorsal surface of the distal ends of the distal foot phalanges, particularly those for the first metatarsal. the grave of sk <dig> was also notable for containing a scallop shell , indicating that the remains are likely those of a pilgrim who had completed the way of st james to the cathedral of santiago de compostela in galicia, spain  <cit> .

confirmation that skeleton sk <dig> had been infected with m. leprae
samples of bone from sk <dig> were scraped from the rhino-maxillary area under clean and controlled conditions using disposable gloves, scalpels and tubes. a control sample was taken from around the vomer  of a skeleton, sk <dig>  which showed no osteological evidence of m. leprae. the vomer is a site that often has a high m. leprae burden in lepromatous leprosy, and so is a good site from which to isolate m. leprae dna. the presence of m. leprae dna in the sk <dig> extract was previously confirmed by real-time pcr using primers for the multicopy rlep and the single copy locus, ml <dig> , both of which gave single bands of the expected size   <cit> . the presence of m. leprae dna in extracts from sk <dig> was similarly confirmed by pcr. pcr for the multicopy m. tuberculosis loci is <dig> gave no products  for either sample, indicating an absence of tuberculosis. the control sample sk <dig> gave no products with primers for loci of either m. leprae or m. tuberculosis, indicating that contamination of the samples from extraneous sources or cross-contamination between the samples was negligible.

whole genome sequencing of m. leprae genomes from skeletons sk <dig> and sk27
dna from skeletons sk <dig> and sk <dig> was amplified, enriched for m. leprae sequences using microarrays, and sequenced as described previously for sk <dig> and sk <dig>  <cit> . details of the read depths, their alignment to the m. leprae tn reference genome and percentage genome coverage are given in table  <dig>  after quality controls less than 1% of the sequence reads aligned with human dna, even in the control sample sk <dig>  only  <dig> % of reads aligned to human dna.

*presented in this study, other details were previously published in schuenemann et al.,  <dig>  <cit> .

the control sample, sk <dig>  was characterized by very low coverage of the m. leprae genome, punctuated by short regions with high coverage and high diversity. this is consistent with a sample containing little or no m. leprae sequence, but with some carry-over of dna from environmental organisms. this again confirms that there was little or no cross-contamination between samples or from modern m. leprae dna during the sample preparation. many of the reads that were retrieved from sk <dig> had similarity to environmental organisms that contain genomic regions that are likely to be conserved across mycobacteriaceae and beyond. such regions apparently have sufficient similarity to the microarray probes to hybridize, particularly in the absence of competing m. leprae dna, but are sufficiently dissimilar to generate the high diversity observed. regions with high coverage included approximately  <dig> genes such as rpob, tuf, fusa and certain smaller regions within genes that often represent conserved motifs, for example within abc transporters. base calls from regions with high coverage in the control sample were not considered reliable and were discounted from the data.

sanger sequencing of targeted snps  was in agreement with illumina sequencing so validating both typing and sequencing methods. analysis of vntr genotypes was not possible for either sk <dig> or sk <dig> as insufficient numbers of reads spanned the ml0058c  region, while ml2344-ml <dig>  <dig> and ml2172-ml <dig>  <dig> had high coverage in the sk <dig>  the control sample, and so were deemed unreliable.

analysis of the ancient m. leprae genomes
we have previously used pcr and sanger sequencing of a subset of snps  <cit>  to genotype the m. leprae from sk <dig> as type 2f  <cit> . using identical methods, we also identified sk <dig> as a type 2f strain .

independent analysis of the sequence reads at the university of tübingen and the university of surrey , generated differing values for coverage and read depth. however, both centres reconstructed very similar genomes with only a single snp discrepancy  between the comparable datasets. comparison of the sk <dig> and sk <dig> m. leprae genomes with other modern and ancient genomes identified the presence of very few novel polymorphs . sk <dig> contained  <dig> novel indels, all of which were in pseudogenes, and  <dig> novel snps, only one of which was non-synonymous, encoding a change of gly <dig> to valine in hypothetical protein ml <dig>  sk <dig> had a single novel synonymous snp and no identifiable novel indels. phylogenetic analysis generated trees comparable to those of schuenemann et al. <cit>  and placed sk <dig> and sk <dig> in the highly conserved type 2f branch of m. leprae . it is notable that the strain most closely related to sk <dig> is another isolate from winchester, sk <dig>  described in our previous studies  <cit> .

discussion
the history of leprosy in europe is dominated by a drawn-out epidemic that may have lasted a millennium, but peaked between the 11th and 14th centuries before declining during the following centuries. in other parts of the world the incidence of leprosy has remained high despite the administration of multi-drug chemotherapy. understanding the origins and macroecology of leprosy worldwide, and specifically why it declined in europe, may help in the development of improved control strategies against the endemic worldwide leprosy of today.

ancient dna can be uniquely useful in constructing and assessing models of pathogen evolution  <cit>  and macroecological patterns of infection. this is particularly so for m. leprae, whose extremely limited genotypic diversity has facilitated the development of models describing the evolution of modern strains and their historic worldwide dissemination. to more fully inform these models and to capture the diversity of m. leprae we have begun a bioarchaeology program of research to sequence and reconstruct the genomes of ancient m. leprae that infected medieval people at the site of the leprosarium of st mary magdalen, at winchester, in southern britain  <cit> . here we continue our characterization of these m. leprae strains and present two new 1000 year old mycobacterial genomes, which in combination with previous samples, allow us to describe, in detail, the historical epidemiology of leprosy at this location across the centuries.

rather than reveal a greater diversity of mycobacterial strains, the genomes that we present are striking in their similarity to modern m. leprae, providing further confirmation that the medieval european leprosy epidemic involved strains almost identical to those that today infect people in other parts of the world. it could be argued that this lack of diversity is an artifact of enriching the ancient dna for m. leprae sequence using microarrays based upon modern m. leprae genomes, potentially allowing genomic re-arrangements or insertions to go undetected. however, such a scenario would seem unlikely. firstly, these samples fall within the limits of diversity observed in the de novo assembled genomes, both ancient and modern  <cit> , none of which have alternative genome architectures. secondly, we would expect any such changes in genome architecture to be observable in the data as apparent indels at the ends of sequence reads, each representing the boundaries of any such re-arrangement. no such indels were identified in the data. this leaves us to conclude that these ancient strains were indeed highly similar to modern strains and, therefore, the diminishing incidence of leprosy in europe was not caused by the evolution of m. leprae to a distinct genotypes that was less virulent or less transmissible. a more probable explanation is that changing social conditions reduced the rate of transmission and that concomitant epidemics of tuberculosis and yersinia pestis  resulted in high rates of mortality in leprosy infected individuals, effectively reducing the reservoir of transmissible infection  <cit>  and hastening the selection of resistant host genotypes in the human population. a further factor may have been an increase in immunological resistance to leprosy in the population associated with exposure to the increasing levels of tuberculosis  <cit> .

the genomes of the m. leprae from skeletons sk <dig> and sk <dig> group firmly with other type 2f strains. moreover, the most closely related m. leprae strain in the worldwide phylogeny  to sk <dig> is another ancient st magdalen skeleton, sk <dig>  described in our previous studies  <cit> . both individuals were contemporaneous children or adolescents, illustrating vividly the epidemic and conserved nature of leprosy at this site.

until recently, type 2 m. leprae had only been identified in asia and the near east. it had been assumed that these type  <dig> strains gave rise to type  <dig> strains and moved with human migration to become the archetypal strains in western europe  <cit> . however, we and others have shown the presence of type  <dig> strains in europe  <cit>  in the 11th and 12th centuries, alongside the more typical type 3k, 3m and 3i strains  <cit>  . it is now clear that, at least at winchester, type 2f strains, rather than being unusual, may well have been a co-dominant or even the predominant strain during the 11th century. the lack of type 2f strains and presence of type 3i strains in later burials both here at winchester, and elsewhere in europe  <cit>  may be indicative of the shift away from type 2f strains towards the type  <dig> strains of leprosy typically seen in later european and north american  strains. it is difficult, from these data, to determine whether the type 2f strains identified at st mary magdalen were truly endemic to the area, or whether they were a relatively new introduction, possibly associated with trade or pilgrimage, evidence for which is graphically illustrated by the presence of a scallop shell in the grave of sk <dig>  whatever their origins, the apparent displacement of type 2f strains by type  <dig> strains in later archaeological and contemporary samples is unlikely to have been due to a selective pressure as there are very few genetic differences between strains, and those that are present are not predicted to encode phenotypic changes. an alternative model describing a shift towards a type  <dig> european m. leprae population driven by allelic drift associated with a waning european leprosy epidemic would seem more plausible.

CONCLUSIONS
through the study of bioarchaeology and specifically ancient dna, we are gaining a greater understanding of the medieval european leprosy epidemic. by concentrating on a single well-characterized site typical of british leprosaria, st mary magdalen near winchester, we have gained a detailed and almost personal insight into the wider epidemic and how it changed across the centuries. our findings reveal that at this site during the 11th century, leprosy strains were typically part of a closely related group of type 2f strains, not the type  <dig> strains that predominate in later european samples.
