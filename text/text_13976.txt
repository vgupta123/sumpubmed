BACKGROUND
impairment of cognitive function is a feature that has been observed in diabetes, especially in type ii diabetic patients  <cit> , although the relationship remains disputed. increased glycated hemoglobin  <dig> , indicating increased average blood glucose levels over a longer period, is related to lower cognitive function in individuals with type  <dig> diabetes and the decline in glycemic control is related to lower scores on cognitive function tests  <cit> . in turn, this is in accordance with the finding of advanced glycation end-products  in dementia and diabetic microvascular disease, in which decreased cerebral glucose metabolism is observed  <cit> . indeed, low rates of glucose metabolism in brain cells lead to the accumulation of glycoproteins associated with subsequent formation of cytotoxic aggregates in brain  <cit> . animal experiments also suggest a relationship between diabetes and cognitive impairment, as observed in type  <dig> diabetic models of genetically obese zucker rat or db/db mouse  <cit>  and in type  <dig> diabetic models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in rat  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . as neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by defects in brain protein maintenance  <cit> , we employed an inbred model for type  <dig> diabetes the fa/fa zucker diabetic fatty  rat to study the effects of high glucose concentration on protein expression in brain. moreover, there is still a lack of strategies to inhibit diabetes induced toxic protein aggregate formation in tissues which could be to some degree answered by our research.

protein aggregate formation affects cellular function and has been implicated in various aging related disorders  <cit>  and complications  <cit> . protein aggregation is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation with cognitive deficits  <cit> , including alzheimer’s, parkinson’s and huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, ataxias, and human prion diseases. in many neurodegenerative complications such as alzheimer’s, these tangles contain phf  which are highly insoluble structures, composed of a highly phosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein tau. although the characterization of brain protein aggregation is still insufficiently reported in type  <dig> diabetes, the close similarity in protein aggregate formation between diabetes and alzheimer’s may indeed indicate that the two conditions share key mechanistic targets  <cit> . it has been suggested that mtor , which is an established component in proteostasis known to be implicated in different neurodegenerative complications  <cit> , may represent an important link between nutrient excess with obesity and insulin resistance and their possible complications  <cit> . although mtor is an important regulator of neuronal development and function, including tau expression  <cit> , to date only few studies have addressed a possible implication of mtor in diabetes in relation to protein aggregate formation in brain tissue. considering the induction of mtor by high glucose levels  <cit> , the mtor pathway is likely implicated in the induction of brain protein aggregation in diabetes  <cit> . the presence of oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species , and increased protein glycosylation leading to protein-protein crosslinking or aggregation  <cit>  might be additional factors involved.

different mechanisms deal with misfolded proteins to prevent the accumulation of aggregates. one such mechanism is autophagy, which removes ubiquitinated misfolded protein aggregates. in the light of possible mtor activation   <cit> , autophagy may be inhibited by phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s <dig>  a main downstream effector of mtor  <cit> . in addition, degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system seems involved in the clearance of misfolded proteins, especially oxidative stress induced ubiquitinated  proteins that are resistant to breakdown via autophagy and ubiquitin routes  <cit> . although acute oxidative stress induces autophagy  <cit> , it is still conceivable that in diabetes the chronically increased levels of glucose may lead to imbalances in the antioxidant capacity within the cell. in turn, this would result in oxidative stress-mediated injury  <cit>  which may impair autophagic clearance routes as observed in cells cultured at high glucose concentrations  <cit> , thus further contributing to the formation of highly insoluble aggregates.

another defense mechanism against protein aggregate formation constitutes of brain antioxidants such as fabp, thiol groups or h2s which would restrict oxidative damage by high glucose concentrations. it is known that pyridoxamine, an antioxidant and allosteric activator of the h2s producing enzyme cystathionine beta synthase  inhibits age formation  <cit>  and protects cells from oxidative damage  <cit> . we have previously shown that h2s, as nahs, modulates mtor pathway in aging werner syndrome skin fibroblasts and inhibits protein aggregation and aging phenotype while diminishing oxidative stress  <cit> . further h2s has been also shown to induce protective autophagy in colon epithelial cells  <cit> . nevertheless, the effect of h2s on inhibition or reversal of protein aggregation has yet not been studied in diabetic brain.

the first aim of this study was to identify diabetes induced protein aggregation in brain tissue obtained from an animal model of diabetes mellitus type  <dig>  as frontal brain is implicated in cognitive behavior  <cit> , we established the nature of protein aggregates in this brain region in  <dig> weeks old zucker diabetic fatty rats  compared to age matched lean controls, and explored proteostasis routes. as we found changes in brain proteostasis to coincide with lower levels of brain thiol groups and diminished expression of cbs in zdf, we sought as a second aim to investigate a potential beneficial effect of h2s. however, others have previously demonstrated that administration of h2s  influences glycemic control in vivo thus changing blood glucose and hba1c levels  <cit> . therefore, we examined the effect of nahs treatment on proteostasis in cultured brain tissue slices to assess the direct effects of h2s on brain, while excluding confounding effects of the modulation of glycemic control.

RESULTS
hba1c and glucose concentrations
development of diabetes in zdf was monitored by measurement of hba1c, glucose and body weight . body weight of zdf animals was significantly increased compared to age matched lean controls at all time points examined. moreover, the increase in body weight of zdf animals between week  <dig> and  <dig> ) was 27% higher compared to the increase observed in lean animals between week  <dig> and  <dig> ). the impairment of glycemic control in zdf animals was evidenced by both significantly higher blood glucose and hba1c levels compared to lean at all time points examined. at week  <dig> in zdf the percent difference to lean amounted to  <dig> ± <dig> % and  <dig> ± <dig> %  for blood glucose and hba1c respectively. the increase in blood glucose of zdf animals between week  <dig> and  <dig> ) was 13% higher compared to the increase observed in lean animals between week  <dig> and  <dig> ). in addition, the increase in hba1c level of zdf animals between week  <dig> and  <dig> ) was 33% higher compared to the increase observed in lean animals between week  <dig> and  <dig> ). finally, the glucose concentration in the brain homogenates of the zdf group  was found to be significantly higher than in the lean group . together, these data demonstrate significantly impaired glycemic control in zdf, yet without the full blown development of overt diabetes type  <dig> 

body weight, hba1c levels, and blood glucose levels are significantly increased in zdf compared to lean rats as measured in week  <dig> to week  <dig>  * <  <dig>  = different from controls  at the same stage.

protein aggregates, tau and fibronectin expression
the silver stain showed a doubling of the number of protein aggregates present throughout the frontal brain in zdf . the aggregates were seen as black/brown entities with a tangled conformation . to further substantiate increased protein synthesis in zdf brains, the ratio of protein-to-dna was measured. this ratio was significantly increased in zdf brains showing higher protein synthesis levels in zdf brains . the expression of tau and fibronectin were investigated by western blot analysis and qpcr analysis. tau protein levels were increased in zdf brains compared to lean . especially tau protein isoforms with molecular weights around  <dig> and 65 kda  <cit>  were increased in frontal sections of zdf compared to lean . in immunohistochemistry analysis, tau protein was seen as black/brown entities with an intact pattern in lean brain but a dispersed pattern in zdf brain , which may suggest the cleavage of tau protein in zdf. total tau mrna levels also showed a two times increase in zdf brains . fibronectin protein expression was investigated because of its higher level of expression in diabetes  <cit>  and also its presence in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . we observed that fibronectin protein in frontal brain of zdf was about  <dig> times higher compared to lean . this was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry analysis of brain tissue . fibronectin mrna levels were also found to be  <dig> times higher in zdf brains compared to lean .

proteostasis components
increased expression of proteins such as tau and fibronectin in the face of aggregate formation may denote derailment of proteostasis in neurons. therefore, we examined activation of the mtor pathway as a major route controlling protein synthesis, as well as protein degradation by autophagy and ubiquitylation. zdf brain demonstrated an increased expression of mtor and phosphorylation of mtor  in zdf . next, we examined ribosomal protein s <dig> , being the immediate downstream target of the mtorc <dig> pathway conveying increased protein synthesis. in brain of zdf, expression of both s <dig> and phosphorylated s <dig>  was markedly elevated compared to lean . the ratios of the phosphorylated forms of mtor and s <dig> ribosomal protein over the total expression of these proteins in brain was increased for both mtor  and s <dig>  in zdf brains, disclosing the activation of the mtor pathway. to examine autophagy, western blotting for lc <dig>  was performed. zdf rats showed an increased expression of lc3-i, with lower expression of lc3-ii compared to lean . the ratio of lc3-ii-to-lc3-i in zdf brains is halved compared to lean brain showing lower autophagy levels in zdf brains . also, zdf brains showed increased levels of mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins . collectively, these data substantiate the impairment of proteostasis in zdf brain consisting of increased protein synthesis and degradation via the proteosomal route accompanied by lower autophagy levels.

glycosylation and reactive oxygen species damage
diabetes is associated with increased ros  production, part of which is explained by glycosylated protein species inhibiting the electron transport chain of mitochondria  <cit> . indeed, zdf brain showed a slight, but significantly increased level of carboxymethyllysine , indicating the presence of glycosylated protein species . moreover, hif1a  levels, known to be upregulated through ros formation  <cit> , were increased in zdf brains . also, zdf brain showed a lower expression of fabp , a protein depleted by ros damage. further, a fluorogenic probe was used to assess the formation of ros in brain tissue. ros formation in brain homogenate was doubled in zdf compared to lean .

brain cbs expression and thiol group content
expression of cbs  and brain thiol groups were assessed in brain to evaluate the antioxidant defense levels. cbs protein expression , cbs mrna levels  and % thiol groups  were found to be significantly lower in zdf brain compared to lean.

nahs treatment diminishes protein aggregation
to examine the pharmacological potential of h2s in counteracting the defective proteostasis in zdf brains while excluding the beneficial effects of h2s in lowering glucose concentrations in the whole animal  <cit> , h2s was administered to cultured brain slices. to this end we used culture medium with 35 mm of glucose, as initial experiments had shown that the normal medium  diminishes protein aggregation in brain . to this end, slices of zdf brain were treated with 50 μm nahs every 10 h for two days. brain slice viability and apoptosis was substantiated by mts and caspase 3/ <dig> assays . cultured brain slices retained protein aggregates . the number of aggregates was doubled in zdf brain slices compared to lean. treatment of zdf brain slices with nahs, however, reduced the number of aggregates to lean levels . n-acetyl cysteine  lowered the number of aggregates but to a lower degree compared to nahs . further, protein synthesis level was substantiated by calculating the ratio of protein-to-dna. this ratio was increased in zdf brain slices showing higher protein synthesis levels in zdf, while nahs counteracted this increase showing inhibitory properties on protein synthesis . a similar pattern of decrease through nahs treatment was also found for the other markers. the 65 kda tau species expression was 3-fold higher in zdf slices compared to lean and nahs treatment was found to normalize tau expression in zdf brain . further, hyperphosphorylated tau, as detected by the at <dig> antibody, was present at 70 kda in zdf brains which was decreased by nahs treatment . also, fibronectin expression was doubled in zdf compared to lean and was normalized by nahs treatment .

the levels of total tau mrna  and fibronectin mrna  was higher in zdf brains compared to lean and this increase in mrna levels was counteracted and lowered to below mrna levels present in lean brains.

the phosphorylation of mtor and s <dig> ribosomal protein was  <dig> times higher in cultured brain slices from zdf and both were lowered to normal levels by nahs treatment . also the total levels of mtor  and s <dig> ribosomal protein  were higher in zdf and were lowered to below the expression observed in lean brains by nahs treatment. the ratios of the phosphorylated forms of mtor and s <dig> ribosomal protein to the total expression of these proteins in each sample show activation of mtor  and s <dig> ribosomal protein  in zdf brains which is fully counteracted by nahs treatment. lc3-i expression was  <dig> times higher in zdf rat brain slices and its level was decreased through nahs treatment . the ratio of lc3-ii-to-lc3-i in zdf brains was two times lower compared to lean brains showing lower autophagy levels in zdf brains. nahs strongly increased autophagy levels in zdf brains . mono- and polyubiquinated protein expression was  <dig> times higher in zdf brains and was also lowered to lean levels by nahs treatment .

hif1a expression was not found different between zdf and lean brains in vitro, but nahs increased the expression of this protein in zdf . fabp expression was reduced in zdf brain slices compared to lean. nahs treatment of zdf brains did not affect fabp expression . the assessment of ros levels shows that treatment of lean at high glucose concentrations did not change ros levels. ros production in zdf brains was inhibited by the addition of nahs or nac .

peroxiredoxin  enzyme modulates oxidative stress via its evolutionary conserved cystein  residues. under oxidative stress condition, cystein sufinic acid of prx becomes oxidized. to further study the potential oxidation of prx enzymes under oxidative stress in zdf brain, we performed western blot analysis with oxidized prx specific antibody, anti-prx-so <dig> in all samples. our results show that peroxiredoxins is highly oxidized in zdf brain and that nahs and nac reverse this process .

thus, nahs might be counteracting the defective proteostasis and protein aggregation in cultured zdf brain slices through reduction in protein synthesis and inhibition of oxidative tress.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate the increase in protein aggregates in brain of zdf rats probably due to a derailment in protein homeostasis, which was reversed in vitro by treatment with nahs. it appears that several factors might be contributing to protein aggregation in zdf brains. first, protein synthesis is enhanced, as evidenced by the increase in the expression and activation of mtor and s <dig> proteins in zdf brains. further, the loss of proper defense against the increased oxidative stress seems to be involved, as demonstrated by decreased levels of fabp, thiol levels and cbs and higher amounts of glycosylated proteins in zdf. finally, the clearance mechanisms for deviant proteins seem impaired, as demonstrated by the excess of ubiquitinated proteins  and a relative impairment of autophagy in zdf. the exact order and contribution of these factors in zdf is hard to unravel. yet our experiments in brain slices cultured under increased glucose conditions suggest that the loss of oxidant defense has an important role, as aggregates from zdf were abolished by treatment with nahs, which is known to be a strong cytoprotective antioxidant  <cit> . in addition, we also found nahs to inhibit the mtor pathway and the resulting inhibition of protein synthesis is likely contributing to the beneficial effects of nahs on protein aggregation. together, our results suggest that diabetes induces protein aggregation in brain of zdf rats and could potentially provide a basis for possible therapeutic strategies in cognitive disorders related to protein aggregation.

our data disclose the presence of protein aggregates in zdf brains. tau and its hyperphosphorylated form  is one of the main neuronal proteins involved in protein aggregation  <cit>  and has been implicated in the loss of cognitive performance  <cit> . hyperphosphorylated tau  has been observed previously in the brain of mice models of type  <dig> and  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . importantly both p-tau  <cit>  and protein aggregates have been found in the brain of streptozotocin  induced mouse model of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . thus, the increased total tau mrna together with phosphorylation of tau protein in zdf rat brains, might cause impairment in cellular function and cognitive disorders  <cit> . tau hyperphosphorylation in diabetes might be due the tau protein cleavage inducing toxic tau aggregation. indeed, we observed a dispersed pattern of tau protein staining, which might suggest the cleavage of tau protein in zdf brain, consistent with a recent report suggesting that tau cleavage is an early event in aggregate pathology  <cit> . possibly, high glucose is implicated in ros formation  <cit>  and the increase in tau cleavage and phosphorylation might be secondary to the chronic presence of ros in diabetes  <cit> . the increase in advanced glycation end-products  due to protein glycation in zdf, as exemplified by the increased cml expression, may constitute a core for protein aggregation and probably underlie the process of cognitive decline  <cit> . high glucose is implicated in the increase in cml in zdf brains  <cit>  and the increase in fibronectin, a component of extracellular matrix, we observed, may also be due to higher glucose levels and the subsequent excessive ros formation, as found previously in astrocytes  <cit> .

our data implicate that several changes in proteostasis might underlie protein aggregate formation in zdf brains. we found both the expression and phosphorylation of mtor and s <dig> ribosomal protein to be higher in zdf brains. phosphorylation of these proteins is necessary for protein synthesis. high glucose is known to stimulate mtorc <dig> to promote protein synthesis  <cit> , which may represent one of the main causes of protein aggregate formation in zdf brain. indeed, mtor inhibitors such as rapamycin protect against aggregate formation in taupathies  <cit> . in addition to mtor activation, changes in the two major intracellular protein degradation systems, the autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit>  were observed. our data suggest a blockade in the autophagy pathway, thus limiting protein turnover, in zdf brain in view of the absence of transition of lc3-i into lc3-ii. such blockade in autophagy is in line with the results in alzheimer’s models, in which the induction of autophagy is known to lead to a massive accumulation of autophagy intermediates  with low levels of clearance  <cit>  along dystrophic and degenerating neurites. in addition to its effect on autophagy, proteosomal breakdown of proteins seems also affected, as zdf had higher expression of ubiquitinated proteins , which normally are processed by proteosomal degradation  <cit> . ub-protein aggregates increase in hyperglycemia and endoplasmic reticulum stress  <cit>  and get accumulated in neuronal inclusions  <cit> . curiously, ub-proteins accumulated in zdf brains had a lower molecular weight compared to lean, which might reflect the increased protein cleavage in zdf brain. taken together, in zdf brains the protein synthesis machinery is activated while protein degradation is impaired, likely becoming the leading cause in the formation of protein aggregates.

ros damage to proteins exists in brain cells at high glucose levels  <cit>  likely representing a second driving force for protein aggregation in diabetes. the presence of increased ros in zdf brain is evidenced by the decrease in fabp, and the increases in hif1a and ros production. further, the increase in cml indicates impaired glucose metabolism and formation of oxidized amino acids in zdf brains  <cit> . thus, our results demonstrate that ros production is likely increased in brain of zdf rats. oxidative stress might precede protein deposition  <cit> , but conversely protein aggregates may also increase ros formation and damage brain cells through oxidization of neuronal components  <cit>  eventually leading to apoptotic or necrotic cell death  <cit> . thus, a suitable antioxidant, potentially to some degree inhibits the damage present at high glucose concentrations. additional loss of oxidant defense also would amplify the detrimental effects of ros. amongst all the antioxidants that are available in the body, thiols constitute the major portion of the total body antioxidants and they play a significant role in defense against reactive oxygen species  <cit> . here our data show for the first time that the levels of cbs, one of the main h2s producing enzymes in brain, and thiol content are significantly lower in zdf brains.

treatment with nahs decreased protein aggregates in cultured slices of zdf frontal brain. higher glucose levels  in culture medium provided a suitable in vitro model for the experiments, first because according to our previous experiment we found a lower glucose level  to diminish the number of protein aggregates in vitro and second because higher glucose levels are known to decrease h2s levels  <cit> . we have previously shown that nahs modulates mtor activity and inhibits ros production in aging werner syndrome skin fibroblasts while inhibiting protein aggregation in these cells  <cit> . moreover, the induction of free thiol groups in an organism might have an important role in delaying the aging process  <cit> . this research is the first report pointing to the therapeutic potential of h2s as nahs in protecting against protein aggregation in brain. h2s may exert its protective effect through various mechanisms. first, h2s possesses antioxidant properties and administration of nahs inhibits reactive oxygen species, and the deposition of ecm  components in diabetic rats  <cit> . indeed, nahs treatment upregulated hif1a in brain slices, potentially protecting cells against oxidative stress while increasing glucose tolerance/metabolism and mediating a neuroprotective response  <cit> . its important to note that according to the presented data, having anti-oxidant properties is not enough for a substance to lower protein aggregates in zdf brain to lean levels, as nac which is known to have strong antioxidant activity, inhibited ros formation but did not show the full beneficial effects of nahs in lowering protein aggregates. thus, these results suggest the presence of additional mechanism involved in the beneficial action of nahs, although ros inhibition is most probably an important factor. secondly, h2s may act through inhibition of the mtor pathway. we found h2s to inhibit protein synthesis by inhibition of mtor as also shown previously in kidney cells  <cit> . a third mechanism of action of h2s may constitute of regulation of autophagy. we found h2s supplementation to regulate and lower lc3-i expression in zdf brain. h2s treatment led towards higher autophagy as shown by lc3-ii/lc3-i ratio. the increase in sirt- <dig> levels and sirt- <dig> phosphorylation could be another important indicator of higher autophagy levels through h2s treatment  <cit> . as nahs normalized proteostasis in zdf brains by inhibiting protein synthesis and gene expression, it would be conceivable that the regulation of autophagy by h2s represents a lowered flux of defective proteins to the autophagy pathway. finally, an effect of h2s on cellular metabolism may convey beneficial effects in diabetes. hyperglycemia is known to inhibit amp kinase  activity leading to cellular damage  <cit> , h2s has the potential to preserve mitochondrial function  <cit>  via regulation of mitochondrial atp-sensitive potassium channel, p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun nh-terminal kinase pathway. consequently, h2s potentially constitutes a suitable treatment against hyperglycemia induced cell damage in case the above pathways are affected  <cit> . moreover, h2s has been shown to regulate proteostasis in diabetic animals through activation of ampk  <cit> . interestingly, h2s also potentiates the function of nmda-glutamate receptors implicated in long term memory, while protecting proteins against nitration or oxidation  <cit> . thus, h2s exerts different protective effects which seem to be of importance in the protection of brain tissue from hyperglycemia stress and protein aggregation. the changes in the expression of several proteins probably involved in high glucose induced protein aggregation in zdf brain and the effect of nahs on protein aggregation and protein expression in zdf brain are summarized in table  <dig> 

zdf brain was compared to lean brain as control and nahs treated zdf brain was compared to zdf brain as control. the arrows indicate the changes in each parameter.

although zdf animals displayed both an increase in non-fasting blood glucose levels and hba1c, it should be noted that the development of overt diabetes was considerably slower in this batch of zdf than observed in our previous experiments in the same animal strain  <cit> . while the reason for this remains elusive, in view of the current data, the animals would be best defined as being pre-diabetic.

this study identified the presence of protein aggregation and its key mechanistic targets in zdf brain and found it to coincide with lowered brain thiol levels and lowered cbs expression. in addition, we demonstrate for the first time that the administration of h2s donor, nahs, diminishes protein aggregation in the brain. although we have presented several hypothesis in regards to possible mechanism by which h2s inhibits protein aggregation in zdf brain, our goal here was not to establish a mechanism of action for h2s treatment but rather to show that h2s inhibits protein aggregates in zdf brains. this study provides further insight into beneficial effects of h2s which may be exploited to protect the diabetic brain.
