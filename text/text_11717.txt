BACKGROUND
sec18p/n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  is a conserved atpase required for vesicle membrane fusion in eukaryotes. in yeast and mammalian cells, the mechanism of vesicle membrane fusion, which is mediated by sec18p/nsf and the soluble nsf attachment protein  receptor  complex, has been extensively investigated. nsf assembles with snap and snares to form a 20s snare fusion complex that mediates membrane fusion between vesicles  <cit> . this 20s fusion complex is disassembled by nsf via atp hydrolysis  <cit> . during this process, sec18p/nsf, acting as a snare chaperone, binds to snare complexes, disassembling them and facilitating snare recycling by utilizing the energy from atp hydrolysis. the rate of sec18p/nsf-mediated disassembly correlates to the snare-activated atpase activity of nsf  <cit> .

nsf is also involved in protein trafficking  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that nsf binds directly to the c-terminal tail of the glur <dig> subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate  receptor in a snap-dependent manner to regulate the function of these receptors  <cit> . mcdonald et al. have found that nsf can bind to β-arrestin <dig> and plays a hitherto role in facilitating clathrin coat-mediated internalization of g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> . cong et al. have confirmed that nsf can bind to β <dig> adrenergic receptors  at the final three amino acids in the c-terminal tail of these receptors, thereby regulating receptor recycling  <cit> .

to date, very limited information about sec18p/nsf and snare complexes in plants is available. sato et al. have cloned a homolog of nsf from tobacco, designated as ntnsf- <dig>  which encodes a 739-aa protein that displays atp binding capacity  <cit> . hugueney et al. have investigated a plastid fusion and/or translocation factor  in capsicum annuum and demonstrated that it functions in vesicle fusion in an atp-dependent manner. however, pftf, which encodes a 72-kda protein, was only expressed in leaves and young fruit in red peppers  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis indicated that its cdna sequence displays 53% and 51% homology with yeast sec18p and mammalian nsf, respectively. however, the functions of ossec <dig>  a homolog of sec18p/nsf in rice, remain unknown.

more recently, some studies have indicated that the proteins involved in protein sorting play important roles in plant development. vacuolar protein sorting  <dig>  is a component of a retromer complex that recycles the vacuolar sorting receptor vps <dig> from the pre-vacuolar compartment  to the golgi complex. in arabidopsis, the vps <dig> homolog maigo <dig> /atvps <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in various organs, including leaves, roots, flowers and developing seeds  <cit> . the mag <dig> mutant  exhibits a dwarf phenotype, suggesting that it may play a significant role in plant growth and development  <cit> . furthermore, vps <dig> is involved in endosome homeostasis, pin protein cycling, and vsr recycling from the pvc to the trans-golgi network  during the trafficking of soluble proteins to the lytic vacuole   <cit> . moreover, the protein sorting protein  <dig> , a member of the sec1p family, is involved in vesicle-mediated protein trafficking in various organelles of the endomembrane system  <cit> . bassham et al. have found that atvps45p co-localized with an epidermal growth factor receptor-like protein  in arabidopsis in the tgn and that atvps45p functions in the transport of proteins to the vacuole in plants  <cit> . however, the relevance of ossec <dig> and pvc remains to be determined in rice.

ribosomal acid protein p <dig> as a component of p <dig>  <dig> complex, functioning on protein synthesis as a subunit of 60s ribosomes  <cit> . the c-terminus  of p <dig> binds to the  small complex  <cit> , while the n-terminus  of p <dig> interacts to the rna molecule after p <dig> complex formed  <cit> . mutation of p <dig> gene affects the ribosome activity and viability of saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . barnard et al. and kondoh et al. have found that the human ribosomal phosphoprotein p <dig> may be implicated in human colorectal cancer progression  <cit> . recently, chang et al. have found that overexpression of p <dig> protein might cause oncogenesis in breast and liver tissues by partially inhibiting gcip-mediated tumor suppression  <cit> . all these results suggest that p <dig> protein is important for the protein synthesis as well as other cellular functions, such as oncogenesis  <cit> . rice os60sp <dig> is 60% homologous to human 60sp <dig> in dna sequences and 53% homologous in amino acids sequences. when compared with yeast, the homology is 54% and 46%, respectively  <cit> . however, the functions of p <dig>  <dig> complex in rice have not been previously reported.

in the present study, we investigated the function of ossec <dig> in rice and found that it can complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype but cannot restore vacuolar morphology in yeast. this result suggests that the ossec <dig> gene may perform other unknown functions than in yeast. overexpression of the ossec <dig> gene in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight, and changed the morphology of the protein bodies. further studies demonstrated that ossec <dig> is a component of a 290-kda complex in rice endosperm cells. moreover, os60sp <dig> was identified as a component of this complex, revealing that the ossec <dig> complex contains another complex of p <dig> in rice endosperm cells. furthermore, we determined that the n-terminus of ossec <dig> interacts with the n- and c-termini of os60sp <dig>  whereas the c-terminus of ossec <dig> interacts only with the c-terminus of os60sp <dig>  we proposed a molecular model for the interaction between ossec <dig> and os60sp <dig> 

RESULTS
the expression profile of ossec <dig> in rice
although sec <dig> has been extensively studied in yeast and mammals, its functions in plants remain unknown. to investigate the function of sec <dig> in rice, we first searched the rice genome database . an ossec <dig> gene  is homologous to sec <dig> in yeast. ossec <dig> shares 46%, 45%, 75% and 37% homology with tobacco nsf, yeast sec18p, human ntnsf- <dig> and capsicum annuum pftf, respectively . ossec <dig> contains two aaa atp domains at the c terminus and the middle region of the amino acids sequence, and it displays atp-binding and nucleotide-binding nucleoside-triphosphatase activity.

to explore the expression profile of ossec <dig> in rice, we analyzed various tissues and organs via western blot analysis. the results revealed that ossec <dig> expressed in leaf, stem, inflorescence, and immature and mature seeds but not in root. the highest expression level was found in stem, inflorescence and immature seed .figure  <dig> 
tissue-specific expression patterns of the ossec <dig> protein. r, root; st, stem; l, leaf; if, inflorescence; ims, immature seed; ms, mature seed.



interestingly, we found three isoforms or modifications of ossec <dig>  ossec <dig> displayed the lowest molecular mass in inflorescence and immature seed, followed by mature seed and stem, and the highest mass in leaf. these results indicated that ossec <dig> is expressed as distinct isoforms or is modified in a tissue-specific manner, implying that these isoforms or modifications may play distinct roles in different organs or tissues.

ossec <dig> does not completely complement the function of vesicle fusion in the yeast sec <dig> mutant
to investigate whether ossec <dig> performs the same functions in vesicle fusion as in yeast, a genetic complementation assay was conducted. the ossec <dig> gene driven by the camv35s promoter was introduced into the yeast temperature-sensitive sec18p mutant strain sey <dig>  and the wild-type strain sey <dig> . sey <dig> overexpressing ossec <dig> grew well at 37°c, whereas the mutant sey <dig> alone did not grow .table  <dig>

note: sey <dig> is a temperature-sensitive sec <dig> gene mutant strain that grows slowly at 23°c but does not survive at 37°c; sey <dig>  a wild-type strain, grows normally at 37°c.



these results showed that the ossec <dig> gene complemented the function of the yeast temperature-sensitivity of the yeast sec18p mutant. furthermore, we examined the morphologies of the vacuoles in sey <dig> overexpressing ossec <dig>  no clear differences in vacuole morphology were found between sey <dig> grown at 23°c and the wild-type strain sey <dig> grown at 37°c , but the shapes of vacuoles appeared to be sunken in sey <dig> grown at 37°c . however, an significant difference in vacuolar morphology were observed between sey <dig> grown at 23°c and sey <dig> overexpressing ossec <dig> grown at 37°c . the vacuoles in sey <dig> overexpressing ossec <dig> were smaller compared with those in sey <dig> grown at 37°c as sey <dig> grown at 23°c . moreover, the same vacuolar morphologies were detected in sey <dig> overexpressing ossec <dig> grown at 37°c and in sey <dig> overexpressing ossec <dig> .figure  <dig>

clearly, vesicle fusion was disturbed when ossec <dig> was expressed in yeast cells. these results showed that the ossec <dig> gene not only restored the ability of sey <dig> to grow at 37°c but also interfered with vesicle fusion, thus altering vacuolar morphology in yeast. this result suggests that ossec <dig> performs nearly the same growth-related function as sec18/nsf in yeast, but ossec <dig> also interrupts vesicle fusion and vacuolar morphology.

overexpression of ossec <dig> alters the morphology of the protein bodies
to explore the function of ossec <dig> in rice, we constructed an overexpression vector driven by the camv35s promoter and transformed this vector into the rice genome via biolistic bombardment. nine independent transformants were obtained. the ossec18-positive line 124-5- <dig> was identified via western blotting and pcr, and then used for further experiments. the phenotypic analyses revealed that the plant height significantly decreased by  <dig> % and the 1000-seed weight decreased by  <dig> % in the ossec18-overexpressing line , suggesting that ossec <dig> is involved in rice spikelet development.table  <dig>

furthermore, based on the finding of a change in vacuolar morphology in yeast overexpressing ossec <dig>  we explored whether the morphology of the protein bodies was affected. we examined the subcellular morphology of the protein bodies in endosperm cells. the protein body ii  and protein body i  sizes in line 124-5- <dig> were larger than those of the wild-type line. the size of pbi in the ossec18-overexpressing line was increased by  <dig> %, and that of pbii was increased by  <dig> % . there was a positive correlation between the agronomic phenotypes and the sizes of the protein bodies . these results again showed that ossec <dig> is involved in protein storage vacuolar  morphology in rice endosperm cells.figure  <dig>

ossec <dig> is a component of a 290-kda complex in rice endosperm cells
to further investigate the functions of ossec <dig> in psv morphology during endosperm development, we hypothesized that ossec <dig> might contribute to protein trafficking or docking in a complex form in rice endosperm cell. to test this hypothesis, we performed size exclusion chromatography  and co-immunoprecipitation . as shown in figure 4a, a 290-kda protein complex was identified via sec using the serum against ossec <dig>  to identify the components of this protein complex, the fraction corresponding to this 290-kda complex was separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . the proteins were recovered and sequenced via maldi-tof mass spectrometry. five proteins, heat shock protein 81– <dig> , glutelin type b <dig> , glutelin type a <dig> , 60s acidic ribosomal protein p <dig>  and  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme were identified. to confirm the participation of these proteins in this complex, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. the results indicated that only os60sp0p interacted with ossec <dig>  and no interaction was detected between ossec <dig> and the other four proteins . to verify the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we performed co-ip. as shown in figure 4c, ossec <dig> was detected in the output precipitated using the os60sp0p antibody, and conversely, os60sp0p was detected in the output precipitated using the ossec <dig> antibody. furthermore, we examined the expression patterns of os60sp0p in various tissues, and we found the same expression patterns as those of ossec <dig> . taken together, our results demonstrate that os60sp0p is a component of the ossec <dig> complex in rice endosperm cells.figure  <dig>

to further characterize which domains of ossec <dig> interact with the domains of os60sp0p, we constructed a series of vectors containing different truncated fragments of both ossec <dig> and os60sp0p by inserting random deletion mutations. reciprocal hybrids of these truncated fragments were generated via yeast two-hybrid assays . we found that the n-terminus  and c-terminus  of ossec <dig> interacted with the full-length os60sp0p, and the n-terminus  and c-terminus  of os60sp0p interacted with the full-length ossec <dig> . the middle fragments did not interact with each other. further examination revealed that both the n- and c-termini of ossec <dig> interacted with the n-terminus, but not the c-terminus, of os60sp0p. moreover, the c-terminus of ossec <dig> only interacted with the c-terminus of os60sp0p . these results indicated that the n-terminus head and the c-terminus tail of ossec <dig> bind to the n-terminus head of os60sp0p, whereas the c-terminus tail of os60sp0p only binds to the c-terminus tail of ossec <dig> . these results confirmed that ossec <dig> and os60sp0p are constituents of the same protein complex in endosperm cells, indicating that the n- and c-termini of ossec <dig> can recruit the n-terminus of os60sp0p and that conversely, the c-terminus of os60sp0p can recruit the c-terminus of ossec <dig> figure  <dig>

previous studies showed that 60sp0p in eukaryotes can constitute heterologous complex p <dig> consisting of two p proteins, p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . the c-terminus  of p <dig> binds to the  small complex  <cit> . the lysine-rich n-terminus  can bind to rna when the p <dig> complex is formed  <cit> . our results revealed that the c-terminus of os60sp0p binds to both the n- and c-termini of ossec <dig> . to explore whether heterologous p <dig> complex co-exists in the ossec <dig> complex, we performed western blot using antiserum for p <dig> in the eluent fractions collected during sec. p <dig> and p <dig> were detected in the output fraction precipitated by the ossec <dig> antibody, and p <dig> peaked at 290 kda with ossec <dig>  indicating that p <dig> co-exists in the ossec <dig> complex . to further explore whether ossec <dig> and os60sp <dig> are expressed in the same complex of various tissues, we examined this complex in crude protein extracts from rice stem, leaf and endosperm via co-ip. these results indicated that the ossec18-os60sp <dig> complex presents in the stem and endosperm but not in the leaf , consistent with the expression pattern of ossec <dig>  taken together, our results demonstrate that the heterologous complex p <dig> is a component of the ossec <dig> complex.figure  <dig>

discussion
although sec18p has been extensively studied in yeast and mammalian cells, its functions in plant vacuolar compartments remain to be determined. in this study, we found that ossec <dig> rescued a yeast temperature-sensitive mutant phenotype and affected vacuole morphology by interfering with vesicle fusion when overexpressed in either mutant sey <dig> or wild-type sey <dig> cells in yeast. three isoforms of ossec <dig> were found in different tissues of rice. furthermore, our data further indicated that ossec <dig> affects the morphology of psv in rice endosperm cells. moreover, we identified a 290-kda complex of ossec <dig> in rice endosperm and demonstrated that heterologous complex p <dig> is another component of ossec <dig> complex. our data indicate that ossec <dig>  along with heterologous complex p <dig>  is involved in rice vacuolar morphogenesis.

recently, jaillais et al. studied vacuolar protein sorting  <dig> , a single-copy gene in arabidopsis that is an ortholog of vps <dig> in yeast and mammals  <cit> . they found that not only is the atvps <dig> protein a member of the retromer complex but also is required for endosome homeostasis, pin protein cycling and dynamic pin <dig> repolarization during development. although the interaction among ossec <dig>  os60sp <dig> and pvc had not been reported previously, several studies indicated that the novel function of vps genes rather than vacuolar fusion and protein trafficking  <cit>  . in our study, we found that os60sp <dig> play a novel function of vacuolar morphology than protein synthesis. in general, ribosomal acid protein p <dig>  a component of the p <dig> complex, is a subunit of the 60s ribosomal complex that mediates protein synthesis  <cit> . previous studies indicated that mutation of the p <dig> gene affects ribosome activity and cell viability in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . barnard et al. have found that human ribosomal protein p <dig> phosphorylation is involved in the progression and biological aggressiveness of human colorectal cancer  <cit> . furthermore, kondoh et al. found that p <dig> may exert a causal effect on hepatocellular carcinoma  progression via the translational machinery due to its interaction with eukaryotic elongation factors  <cit> . recently, chang et al. reported that the overexpression of the p <dig> protein may cause tumorigenesis in breast and liver tissues, which at least partially inhibited gcip-mediated tumor suppression  <cit> . based on our data, we found that ossec <dig> interacted with p <dig> to form an ossec18-p <dig> complex. serial deletion mutation demonstrated that ossec <dig> binds to the os60sp0p in a head/tail to head manner. our findings provide insights into the functions of ossec <dig> in plant growth, vesicle fusion and vacuolar morphology.

in our study, we found three isoforms of ossec <dig> in different tissues, clearly suggesting that each isoform may have a unique function in each tissue. the isoform with the highest molecular mass was expressed in leaves, whereas the vacuole morphology and function are largely different from those of other tissues. in addition, the middle size isoform was found in stems and mature seeds, where the vacuoles are transformed into storage- or transportation-related organelles. the smallest isoform was found in inflorescences and immature seeds, which have highly active sites of protein synthesis and cell division. however, the mechanisms by which these isoforms are formed remain unknown. several mechanisms could underlie the formation of these isoforms. one possible mechanism is alternative splicing at the transcriptional level; another possible mechanism is post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. thus, our findings introduce new avenues of investigation into the functions of vacuolar fusion in higher plants. it will be interesting to explore the functions of different isoforms of ossec <dig> in rice in future.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we found that ossec <dig> is a component of a 290-kda complex in rice endosperm cells, and moreover, os60sp <dig> was identified as a component of this complex, revealing that the ossec <dig> complex contains another complex of p <dig> in rice endosperm cells. furthermore, we determined that the n-terminus of ossec <dig> interacts with the n- and c-termini of os60sp <dig>  whereas the c-terminus of ossec <dig> interacts only with the c-terminus of os60sp <dig>  we propose a molecular model for the interaction between ossec <dig> and os60sp <dig>
