BACKGROUND
in recent decades, sulphur deficiency has become an increasing problem in crops of many countries, notably in western europe, leading to sulphur deficiency symptoms and resulting in decreased crop yields and quality parameters  <cit> . in this context, sulphur acquisition and metabolism in plants has become a major concern for research and crop improvement. sulphur is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth. it is mainly acquired by the plant roots as inorganic sulphate and then distributed within the tissues  <cit> . after entering the cells, sulphate is reduced to sulphide with any excess sulphate being stored in the vacuole  <cit> . sulphate assimilation leads to the synthesis of many compounds, including sulphur amino acids , secondary products  and numerous essential metabolites derived from sulphur-containing amino acids, such as cofactors  and vitamins . therefore, sulphur assimilation is an essential part of plant metabolism and plays a crucial role in many plant processes. for example, as part of glutathione, sulphur has a role in the maintenance of the cellular redox balance and mitigation of oxidative stress in response to environmental changes. furthermore, as constituent of sulphur amino acids, sulphur is tightly connected to protein synthesis and metabolism and is of great importance in terms of nutritional value. indeed, animals and humans are unable to synthesize methionine and are dependent on dietary sources of this amino acid. seeds of many agronomically important crops, including grain legumes, while rich in proteins, are deficient in the sulphur amino acids. tabe and droux  <cit>  demonstrated that sulphate is the dominant form of sulphur found in the phloem supplying pods during lupin seed development and that the seed is able to reduce and assimilate sulphate in sufficient quantities for its needs. therefore, identifying the mechanisms involved in sulphate acquisition and distribution in the developing seed is relevant to seed quality improvement.

the movement of sulphate around the plant and between cell compartments is facilitated by specific sulphate transporters , which are encoded by a large gene family, consisting of  <dig> members in arabidopsis and rice. phylogenetic analyses indicate this gene family can be divided into four closely related groups  each with  <dig> membrane-spanning domains and a stas  domain at the carboxy-terminus  <cit> , and a fifth more distinct group, sultr <dig>  lacking the stas domain  <cit> . notably, the arabidopsis sultr5; <dig> gene has recently been demonstrated to encode a high-affinity root molybdate transporter  <cit> , which raises the question of the role of group  <dig> genes in sulphate transport. considering differences in their kinetics and expression patterns, the different groups have been proposed to represent functional subtypes  <cit> . group  <dig> and  <dig> sulphate transporters, which are localised at the plasma membrane, have been the subject of several studies and are the best characterized groups. members of group  <dig> represent high-affinity transporters that facilitate uptake of sulphate by the root  or translocation of sulphate from source-to-sink organs   <cit> . group  <dig> is composed of low-affinity sulphate transporters whose gene products may rather play a role in vascular tissues, faciliting the translocation of sulphate around the plant . group  <dig> is composed of low affinity transporters localized at the plasma membrane. the data available in the litterature indicate a differential expression of these genes in plant tissues, which is not stimulated by sulphur deficiency  <cit> , and a role for sultr3; <dig> in the root-to-shoot transport of sulphate in cooperation with sultr2; <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> .

unlike groups  <dig> to  <dig>  group  <dig> sulphate transporters have been localized to the vacuolar membrane: a sultr4;1-gfp fusion protein was specifically accumulated in the vacuoles of roots and hypocotyls from young seedlings  <cit> . the sultr4; <dig> gene was shown to be expressed in roots under sulphur-sufficient and deficient conditions, where it may play a role in the efflux of sulphate from the vacuolar lumen into the cytoplasm and influence the vacuolar storage capacity for sulphate  <cit> . in contrast, sultr4; <dig> gene expression was shown to be highly inducible by sulphur limitation in the same tissue. the sultr4;1/sultr4; <dig> double knock-out mutants contained higher amounts of sulphate than did wild-type plants. comparison of single and sultr4;1/sultr4; <dig> double knock-out mutants suggested that sultr4; <dig> plays a major role and sultr4; <dig> has a supplementary function  <cit> . although sulphate transport has been extensively studied in roots, to date there has been no investigation of the roles of individual sulphate transporters within seeds. the vacuole may certainly play a role in the storage and unloading of sulphate within the developing seed, in which case sultr <dig> transporters would be key players.

in this study, we demonstrate that, the arabidopsis sultr4; <dig> gene is strongly expressed in developing seeds and that its disruption significantly increases seed sulphate content, suggesting that sultr4; <dig> is involved in the efflux of sulphate from vacuoles within developing seeds. furthermore, a proteome analysis of sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds reveals metabolic modulations suggesting adaptations to altered sulphate conpartmentation, which implicates sultr4;1-mediated sulphate transport in establishment of defence mechanisms against oxidative stress during seed development.

RESULTS
sultr4; <dig> is strongly expressed during seed filling
we first analysed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  gene expression levels of the arabidopsis sulphate transporters belonging to group  <dig>  . the analysis was performed on isolated seeds , on isolated siliques  and for other tissues , all collected during the reproductive growth phase of plants grown under sulphur-sufficient conditions. in addition, we compared qrt-pcr expression profiles by using an available microarray-based transcriptomics dataset . the qrt-pcr data were consistent with the microarray dataset, but as commonly observed, the dynamic range of expression was higher with qrt-pcr.

the combined set of expression data  showed an expression of both genes in various plant tissues during reproductive growth, but with different levels and patterning of expression. first, sultr4; <dig> was strongly expressed in developing seeds, whereas sultr4; <dig> was preferentially expressed in flowers. second, microarray expression data available for roots of 10-day-old plants subjected to sulphur starvation for  <dig> h revealed that the two genes respond differently to a limitation in sulphur supply, sultr4; <dig> and sultr4; <dig> expression being up-regulated by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively, in these conditions . third, the two genes were differentially expressed during seed development: sultr4; <dig> was highly expressed at the onset of seed filling, whereas sultr4; <dig> was expressed at almost constitutive levels from embryogenesis to the dry mature stage. finally, the qrt-pcr data revealed that the sultr4; <dig> gene was more highly expressed than sultr4; <dig> in most plant organs . notably, sultr4; <dig> was up to 10-fold more expressed in the isolated developing seeds at  <dig> and  <dig> daf as compared with sultr4; <dig>  whereas both transcripts were similarly abundant in the isolated siliques at the same stages. these data suggested the sultr4; <dig> may have an important function within the developing seed, which had not previously been reported and merited further investigations.

sulphate content is elevated in sultr4; <dig> mature seeds
to investigate the role of sultr4; <dig> in determining seed sulphate content, we used a sultr4; <dig> t-dna insertion line from the arabidopsis salk collection  <cit> . the t-dna was located in the stas domain http://atensembl.arabidopsis.info/index.html critical for both the activity and biosynthesis/stability of sulphate transporters  <cit> . the presence of the insertion in plants was confirmed by pcr . mature seeds were collected from homozygous mutant plants and from the corresponding wild-type . sultr4; <dig> gene expression was measured by qrt-pcr in mature seeds of wild-type and sultr4; <dig> mutant plants, from three biological replicates. in the mutant line, the accumulation of the corresponding intact mrna decreased strongly , suggesting that the t-dna insertion altered dramatically transcription and/or mrna stability.

the profiles and contents of major inorganic and organic anions  and the overall sulphur content were determined . interestingly, in mature sultr4; <dig> seeds, the average sulphate content was about  <dig>  fold higher than that of wild-type , whereas seed sulphur content was unchanged . the sulphate form represents a significant fraction of sulphur in mature seeds:  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total sulphur content respectively in wild-type and sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds. with respect to the sultr4; <dig> plant phenotype, no significant difference in seed yield, leaf surface, or onset of flowering was observed . only a slight decrease in sultr4; <dig> seed weight was observed compared to wild-type . these data suggest sulphur flux into developing seeds may not be affected in sultr4; <dig> mutant and the increase in seed sulphate content is therefore not related to a drastic perturbation of sultr4; <dig> vegetative growth. this was further confirmed by estimating the level of sulphate in the seed compartment  and per seed , which increased by ~60% in sultr4; <dig> seeds compared to wild-type .

for the other anions measured, only nitrate content was found to increase in sultr4; <dig> seeds but nitrate levels in the seed compartment or per seed were not significantly different compared to wild-type , suggesting sultr4; <dig> is particularly affected in seed sulphate content. the significant increased pool of sulphate in mature seeds of the sultr4; <dig> mutant could be related to a reduced efflux of sulphate from the vacuoles during seed development, therefore no longer accessible for its assimilatory reduction.

alterations in protein quantities in sultr4; <dig> mature seeds
to determine if the increased sulphate content in sultr4; <dig> seeds, putatively due to a reduced vacuolar efflux capability, has influenced seed composition, seed nitrogen and carbon contents were analysed along with the seed proteome complement. in mature sultr4; <dig> seeds, nitrogen and carbon amounts were unchanged  but important proteome changes were observed as compared to wild-type. with regard to the proteome analysis, total proteins were extracted from three biological replicates and separated by 2d electrophoresis. image analysis of coomassie blue gels using the samespots software allowed the quantification of protein abundance for  <dig> well-resolved spots . statistical analyses  highlighted  <dig> spots for which the abundance in sultr4; <dig> seeds varied significantly compared to wild-type . it is worth noting that among these  <dig> spots,  <dig> showed a higher relative abundance level in sultr4; <dig> seeds, whereas only one spot  showed a decreased accumulation.

to study the putative function of the proteins whose abundance varied or remained unchanged in sultr4; <dig> seeds, we annotated  <dig> spots detected in 2d gels by using proteome reference maps previously established for arabidopsis seeds . the identity of  <dig> spots was confirmed by tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting or lc-ms/ms . of the  <dig> spots varying in the sultr4; <dig> seed proteome,  <dig> were identified. the metabolic pathways modulated in mutant seeds compared to wild-type were revealed by classifying the proteins into functional categories according to the gene ontology of bevan et al.  <cit>  . the distribution into each functional category of proteins whose abundance varied significantly, and the modulated metabolic pathways, are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. in mutant seeds, most of the spots whose abundance varied as compared to wild-type were related to metabolism , detoxification  and energy .

within the metabolism category, lipid and sterol metabolism was particularly affected in mutant seeds: among the five spots identified as proteins related to lipid and sterol metabolism, four  showed an increased abundance in mutant seeds. sugar and polysaccharide metabolism may also be modulated in mutant seeds, since several spots corresponding to enzymes involved in polysaccharide catabolism, a β-glucosidase  and a β-galactosidase , increased in mutant seeds. finally two proteins of amino acid metabolism were also over-accumulated in the sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds that correspond to glutamine synthase  and methionine synthase .

another interesting result was the over-accumulation in mutant seeds of several proteins related to stress response mechanisms. four spots corresponding to enzymes involved in detoxification processes, a glutathione s-transferase , an aldose reductase , a formate dehydrogenase , and a superoxide dismutase , were over-accumulated in the sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds. moreover, spots corresponding to proteins usually up-regulated during stress response and notably oxidative stress  <cit> , such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and alcohol dehydrogenase , were increased in abundance in mutant seeds. these results prompted us to estimate the level of oxidation of the glutathione pool in seeds, which is indicative of the redox status. the amounts of reduced glutathione  and glutathione disulphide  were measured in dry mature seeds freshly collected from wild-type and sultr4; <dig> mutant plants . the mutant seeds possessed higher gssg levels , although the increases were not statistically significant.

in contrast to the substantial variations of proteins involved in metabolism and stress-related pathways, there were few changes in storage protein amounts. of the  <dig> spots annotated as 12s globulin isoforms, which are the most abundant proteins found in arabidopsis seeds , only four varied in abundance between wild-type and mutant seeds. of these variable spots, three  and one  showed respectively an increased and a decreased accumulation in mutant seeds. these variations had no influence on seed protein content since values obtained by the bradford assay were similar for sultr4; <dig> and wild-type seeds.

discussion
in arabidopsis, the sulphate transporter group  <dig> is composed of two members , localized in the vacuolar membrane and reported to be expressed in roots, where a role was proposed in the efflux of sulphate from the vacuole  <cit> . in the present study, we observed that during the reproductive growth phase, sultr4; <dig> was preferentially expressed in developing arabidopsis seeds at the transition between embryogenesis and seed filling and presented a relative transcript abundance much higher than sultr4; <dig>  which was expressed at similar levels throughout seed development . these data, along with previous data reporting that sultr4; <dig> plays a major role and sultr4; <dig> only a small contribution in remobilising the sulphate reserves  <cit> , prompted us to study the role of sultr4; <dig> in determining seed composition. we found a remarkably high level of sulphate constrasting with an unchanged sulphur content in mature seeds of a sultr4; <dig> t-dna mutant , which for the first time implies a function for this transporter in developing seeds. the unchanged seed sulphur content indicates that the increased sulphate level is not related to an enhanced sulphur supply to the developing seed, but rather to a reduction of sulphate utilization/assimilation within the seed. despite the unchanged sulphur content in mature seeds, we cannot exclude that the composition of sulphur or the amount of sulphate and other sulphur metabolites transported to developing seeds could be different between the wild-type and the sultr4; <dig> mutant. however, as no significant difference in seed yield, leaf surface or onset of flowering were observed, the increased sulphate/sulphur ratio in sultr4; <dig> seeds appears not to be related to a drastic perturbation of sultr4; <dig> vegetative growth. the increased sulphate/sulphur ratio in sultr4; <dig> seeds is possibly the consequence of a reduced remobilization  of the vacuolar sulphate pool within the developing seed. the vacuolar localisation of the transporter in seeds has not yet been proven. we therefore cannot exclude that the protein could be localised in different compartments in seeds. however, the increased sulphate/sulphur ratio in mutant mature seeds is consistent with previous data showing that, in roots of sultr4; <dig> mutants, sulphate is retained as a consequence of defects in sulphate efflux from the vacuole  <cit> . it should also be noted, that other genes encoding sulphate transporters are expressed in developing seeds  <cit> . in particular, the sultr3; <dig> gene encoding a putative plasma-membrane sulphate transporter is strongly expressed during early seed filling at similar stages to those of sultr4; <dig>  interestingly, the seed proteome profile of the sultr4; <dig> mutant differs from that of a sultr3; <dig> mutant , indicating that sultr4; <dig> and sultr3; <dig> may have distinct roles/subcellular localization during seed filling.

overall nitrogen and protein levels were unaltered in sultr4; <dig> seeds, but a dissection of the sultr4; <dig> seed proteome revealed that ~10% of the minor protein spots detected in 2d gels varied in abundance , thus reflecting metabolic modifications . in particular, several proteins with roles in the oxidative stress response were up-accumulated. an oxidative stress response has frequently been observed during sulphate deprivation  <cit> , notably in sulphur-deficient seeds  <cit> . in the present study, most of the proteins with roles in the oxidative stress response are involved in detoxification mechanisms . among them were a scavenger of free oxygen radicals , and the glutathione s-transferase isoform  <dig>  that may play a protective role against oxidative damage due to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . this may represent an adaptive response to oxidative stress in sultr4; <dig> seeds as these enzymes detoxify some of the toxic compounds, such as reactive oxygen species , produced by oxidative stress.

at low levels, ros participate in cellular signaling. in arabidopsis seeds, abundant proteins were identified that act as scavengers of ros generated during seed development, thereby counteracting their deleterious effects  <cit> . however, if ros accumulate to harmful levels, seeds lose their ability to control ros and cannot restart their metabolism  <cit> , probably because ros cause irreversible oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and dna. we have observed that sultr4; <dig> seeds lose their viability during storage much more rapidly than wild-type seeds. indeed, seeds collected from homozygous sultr4; <dig> plants did not germinate after two years of storage at room temperature, while almost all seeds collected at the same time from wild-type plants germinated. a tetrazolium test confimed the loss of viability of the sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds , which could be linked to their increased sensitivity to oxidative stress during storage, when ros are known to be continuously produced  <cit> . however, the up-regulation of enzymes involved in ros removal that we see in sultr4; <dig> seeds probably reflects seed developmental events and not changes during sample storage, as the seeds subjected to proteomics were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvest.

in summary, our data suggest sulphate remobilization from the vacuole to the other cell compartments is important for the seed's defence against abiotic oxidative stress during seed development and storage. this could also apply to other tissues, since in arabidopsis roots and shoots, cadmium stress induces an up-regulation of sultr4; <dig> gene expression concomitantly with an oxidative stress response  <cit> . also, in brassica juncea seedlings, sultr4; <dig> gene expression was up-regulated in response to arsenic-induced stress  <cit> , which leads to the generation of ros through the conversion of arsenate to arsenite  <cit> .

besides proteins related to the oxidative stress response, an up-accumulation of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and lipids was revealed. they correspond to enoyl-  reductase , two isoforms of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  <dig> , and ketoacyl carrier protein synthase i . an up-regulation of a ketoacyl carrier protein synthase was also observed in developing arabidopsis seeds under sulphur-starved conditions  <cit> . it is well known that under stress conditions, toxic oxygen derivatives are produced that inactivate enzymes and damage important cellular components, such as membranes via lipid peroxidation and fatty-acid de-esterification. in this context, the up-regulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis may represent a mechanism to repair stress-induced membrane damage. in support of this, li et al.  <cit>  showed that transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing hsd <dig> have an increased tolerance to salt stress.

interestingly, an up-regulation in proteins of the energy and carbon metabolism was observed in sultr4; <dig> seeds. these are involved in glycolysis , photosynthesis or photorespiration , and anaerobic fermentation . since an up-accumulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis was also observed in sultr4; <dig> seeds, it is possible that energy production and glycolysis were enhanced in sultr4; <dig> seeds to provide carbon skeletons for the synthesis of fatty acid precursors in these seeds  <cit> . furthermore, members of the glycosyl hydrolases that specifically release sugar from oligosaccharides  were up-accumulated in sultr4; <dig>  probably as a way to sustain glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis.

this study demonstrated that the accumulation of storage proteins occurs in sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds . in 2d-gels, these proteins are located in the  <dig> to  <dig> kda range . only a few storage proteins differ in abundance from wild-type seeds and these correspond to globulin 12s isoforms . the only protein whose level decreased was the at12s <dig> isoform  and the three proteins whose level increased were at12s <dig>  and at12s <dig> . interestingly, the isoforms whose level increased have a relatively poor sulphur amino acid content  compared to at12s <dig>  whose level decreased. a similar increase in sulphur-poor seed proteins was observed during sulphur deprivation  <cit> . this indicates that, in sulphur-sufficient conditions, sulphate exported from the vacuole via sultr4; <dig> participates but is not limiting for storage protein synthesis. a possibility to be considered is that sultr4; <dig> could also participate to vacuolar sulphate release for storage protein synthesis. however, expression patterns of the gene and data from the literature suggest sultr4; <dig> may have only a supplementary role in sulphate export from the vacuole  <cit> .

interestingly, an increased accumulation of a methionine synthase  was observed in sultr4; <dig> seeds. it is also worth noting that under sulphate-deprived conditions, despite the almost complete depletion of cysteine, the plant is able to keep methionine levels constant  <cit> . this demonstrates the plant's capacity to regenerate methionine through alternative pathways under sulphate-deficient conditions and upon cysteine restriction. methionine can be regenerated through methylation of homocysteine produced by transmethylation via a reaction catalyzed by s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase . moreover, the use of the 4-carbon moiety of s-adenosylmethionine for the synthesis of polyamines and ethylene also is accompanied by recycling of the methylthio moiety and regeneration of methionine  <cit> . interestingly, the protein spot identified in the present study corresponds to a cytosolic isoform involved in the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine produced in the course of the activated methyl cycle  <cit> . in sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds, the up-regulation of methionine synthesis could be a way to sustain seed protein synthesis. moreover, maintaining the synthesis of proteins rich in methionine may be particularly important in stress conditions, since protein-endogenous methionine reacts with ros, as a scavenger, to form sulphoxide  without loss of activity of the corresponding protein  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed a role for sultr4; <dig> in determining sulphate content of mature arabidopsis seeds, possibly because it controls the efflux of sulphate from the vacuoles for metabolism in other cell compartments  <cit> . specific seed metabolic features were also revealed through a fine dissection of the seed proteome of a sultr4; <dig> mutant . in particular, an up-regulation of proteins involved in the oxidative stress response was revealed that suggests a function of sultr4; <dig> in maintaining redox homeostasis during seed development. the maintenance of redox homeostasis is of crucial importance in plant tissues, and even more in seeds that have the ability to tolerate dehydration in the course of their development. this remarkable ability allows the orthodox seed, i.e., seed that can be stored in a state of low moisture content  <cit> , to survive for several years in a desiccated state with metabolic activities at a standstill, until the environmental conditions become optimal for its germination. as seed desiccation enhances ros formation, mechanisms that protect from oxidative stress are therefore crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis  <cit> . glutathione, which is a sulphur-derived product, is a major plant antioxidant. during desiccation, it is converted into the oxidized form glutathione disulphide  and the balance between these two compounds is crucial for homeostasis and seed survival. indeed, the gssg versus gsh ratio can be applied to assess seed viability, since an increased ratio was typically correlated with viability loss in pisum sativum seeds  <cit> . in the present study, we observed that mutant seeds, freshly collected at the dry mature stage, possessed higher gssg levels, although the increases were not statistically significant . it is worth noting that generally, the level of gssg is much higher in mature seeds than in other plant parts. for example, only 10% of total glutathione is oxidized in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . this indicates that the glutathione pool is relatively highly oxidized in mature arabidopsis seeds compared to other plant organs. despite the absence of significant changes in gsh and gssg levels between wild-type and mutant seeds, we cannot exclude a localized disturbance of the redox balance in particular tissue or subcellular compartments of sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds. indeed, as reported by meyer et al.  <cit> , measurements of gssg/gsh ratios in plant tissues are prone to artefacts since they do not take into consideration the subcellular compartmentalization. also, partial oxidation of glutathione during extraction is difficult to avoid and a slight increase in gssg concentration, whilst barely detectable, would suffice to shift the glutathione redox potential to significantly less reducing values  <cit> . for these reasons, and because gssg/gsh ratio in mature seeds is not representative of the events occurring at specific stages of seed development or during storage, future studies will be necessary to evaluate the redox status in different cell types throughout seed development and storage. very little is known about the exact role of sulphate released from the seed vacuoles in the course of seed development in maintaining cellular homeostasis during seed development. although further studies will be necessary, this paper is the first contribution on this topic.
