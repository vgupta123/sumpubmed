BACKGROUND
permanently cold environments are widely distributed on earth, and include the polar regions, mountains and deep-sea environments. despite presenting adverse conditions for life, such as freezing temperatures, low nutrient availability, high water viscosity and reduced membrane fluidity, these environments have been successfully colonized by the three domains of life
 <cit> . cold-adapted microorganisms can grow at 0°c and are classified as psychrophilic if their optimum and maximum temperatures for growth are ≤15°c and ≤  <dig>  respectively, or as psychrotolerant  if their maximum temperature for growth is above 20°c
 <cit> . such microorganisms have adapted their vital cellular processes to thrive in cold environments
 <cit> . they make essential contributions to nutrient recycling and organic matter mineralization, via a special class of extracellular enzymes known as “cold-adapted” or “cold-active” enzymes
 <cit> . because these enzymes have a higher catalytic efficiency than their mesophilic counterparts at temperatures below 20°c and display unusual substrate specificities, they are attractive candidates for industrial processes requiring high enzymatic activity at low temperatures. cold-adapted enzymes include amylase, cellulase, invertase, inulinase, protease, lipase and isomerase, which are used in the food, biofuel and detergent industries
 <cit> . largely because of their potential in biotechnological applications, cold-adapted microorganisms have become increasingly studied in recent years, yet remain poorly understood. of the microorganisms most isolated and studied from cold environments, the majority are bacteria, while yeasts constitute a minor proportion
 <cit> .

antarctica is considered the coldest and driest terrestrial habitat on earth. it is covered almost totally with ice and snow, and receives high levels of solar radiation
 <cit> . the sub-antarctic region, including the shetland south archipelago, has warmer temperatures, the soils close to the sea are free of snow/ice and receive significant quantities of organic material from marine animals; however, they are subject to continuous and rapid free-thaw cycles, which are stressful and restrictive to life
 <cit> . although the first report of antarctic yeasts was published  <dig> years ago
 <cit>  current reports have focused on cold-tolerant bacteria and archaea, with yeasts receiving less attention. yeasts dwelling in antarctic and sub-antarctic maritime and terrestrial habitats belong mainly to the cryptococcus, mrakia, candida and rhodotorula genera
 <cit> . in a recent work,  <dig> % of antarctic yeast isolates were assigned to undescribed species
 <cit> , reflecting the lack of knowledge regarding cultivable yeasts that colonize the antarctic soils. yet these organisms constitute a valuable resource for ecological and applied studies.

this work describes the isolation of yeasts from terrestrial habitats of king george island, the major island of the shetland south archipelago. the yeast isolates were characterized physiologically and identified at the molecular level using the d1/d <dig> and its1- <dig> s-its <dig> regions of rdna. in addition, the ability of the yeasts to degrade simple or complex carbon sources was evaluated by analyzing their extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activities. characterizing these enzyme activities may enhance the potential of the yeasts in industrial applications.

RESULTS
isolation of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant yeasts
the  <dig> soil and  <dig> water samples obtained from different areas of king george island were processed as described in the methods section. the suspensions obtained from each soil samples were seeded onto nutritive plates, and incubated in triplicate over a range of temperatures . after 30– <dig> days of incubation, approximately  <dig> to  <dig> yeast-like colonies developed on each plate. in contrast, no colonies or low colony numbers  appeared on plates from water samples. because large numbers of isolates were obtained, isolates were grouped according to their isolation growth temperature and colony characteristics such as pigmentation, texture, elevation and size. among the  <dig> groups, several differed only by isolation growth temperature. these isolates were grown at different temperatures and re-grouped according to macromorphological characteristics at their optimal growth temperature. in this way,  <dig> groups were ultimately generated. several isolates from each group  were selected for molecular and biochemical analyses.

molecular identification of yeasts
the chromosomal dna was purified from cultures of each yeast isolate and the d1/d <dig> region of 26s rdna and the its1- <dig> s- its <dig>  regions of the rdna were amplified by pcr. the amplicons obtained were purified from gels and sequenced on both strands. isolates showing 100% identity in both rdna sequences were grouped and their dna sequences were submitted to genbank under the accession numbers listed in table
 <dig>  species identification was performed by comparison with the genbank references, using as criterion the blast-hits with ≤  <dig> % difference with the query
 <cit> . in 84% of the isolates the closest blast-hits obtained for both rdna sequences were coincident. when this was not the case, the d1/d <dig> results were used for identification because they yielded higher identity percentages than did the its . 76% of the isolates could be identified to species level by this molecular analysis.  <dig> species belonging to <dig> genera were identified, of which  <dig> and 20% were basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, respectively. the genera containing the highest number of species were mrakia  and cryptococcus . however, the species sporidiobolus salmonicolor was the most abundant, being identified in  <dig> isolates from  <dig> different sampling sites. mrakia gelida was the only yeast species present in both water and soil samples. of the three isolates identified as leuconeurospora sp., two of them  possessed identical d1/d <dig> and its sequences, both of which differed from the third  by  <dig> %. however, the macromorphological characteristics of the three isolates, including pigmentation, differed markedly under identical culture conditions . because of these discrepancies, the molecular and morphological analyses were repeated several times, but the results were highly consistent. the carbon source assimilation pattern also differed between the isolates, as will be discussed later.

physiological characteristics and extracellular enzyme activities
the isolates were grown at six temperatures . almost 70% of the yeast isolates could grow at 22°c or higher, and generally grew optimally at 15°c  or 22°c  . these results were accounted for in the physiological characterizations of the strains. the isolates identified as candida sake, wickerhamomyces anomalus and the four mrakia species, tested positive in glucose fermentation assays. the yeast isolates were tested for the assimilation of  <dig> different carbon sources . besides glucose, the yeasts primarily consumed d-xylose, d-melezitose, d-saccharose, d-trehalose and 2-ketogluconate, while lactose, levulinic acid and erythritol were less assimilated. some yeasts could assimilate glucose alone , but others assimilated as many as  <dig> carbon sources . the assimilation tests were performed for the isolates obtained from different sampling sites and identified molecularly as the same yeast species, with concordant results in most cases. however, the two isolates identified as mrakia psychrophila differed in their assimilation of rhamnose and in the esculin test, while three isolates identified as leuconeurospora sp., two of which were identical at molecular level, differed significantly in their utilization of seven carbon sources. for those isolates that were molecularly identified to genera level only, the carbon assimilation profiles supported their differentiation from the closest blast-hits in each case: cryptococcus sp. differed from cr. terricola  in the assimilation of l-arabinose, trehalose, lactose, l-rhamnnose, l-sorbose and glucosamine; mrakia sp. differed from m. frigida  in the assimilation of maltose, ribose, erythritol and glucosamine, and from m. robertii  in the assimilation of glycerol and erythritol; dioszegia sp. differed from d. crocea  in assimilation of raffinose, mellibiose and glycerol.

to estimate the ability of the yeasts to utilize nutrients in their natural environment, they were initially characterized for the production of  <dig> extracellular enzyme activities. as shown in table
 <dig>  all yeasts displayed at least one enzyme activity, which further enhances their potential for biotechnological/industrial exploitation. the majority exhibited  <dig> to  <dig> enzyme activities, while two exceptional isolates exhibited  <dig> enzyme activities: leuconeurospora sp.   and dioszegia fristingensis  . the most common enzyme activities in the yeast isolates were esterase and lipase, while the least common was xylanase, demonstrated only by d. fristingensis. the three isolates molecularly identified as leuconeurospora sp.  showed important differences in their enzyme activities, as was also observed in the isolates identified as d. fristingensis .

discussion
approximately 70% of the isolated yeasts could grow at temperatures above 20°c, and 16% of them were able to grow at ≥30°c. the predominance of psychrotolerant fungi in cold environments has been previously noted, and is attributable to seasonal and local increases in soil temperature due to solar radiation
 <cit> . in our study, the temperature measured in situ at the different sampling sites ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> °c, but temperatures up to 20°c have been reported in this region
 <cit> . the main obstacle to assessing the yeast communities in antarctic regions is the scant knowledge regarding their environmental and nutritional requirements. because the yeast populations/species inhabiting terrestrial and aquatic environments can colonize specific niches, no appropriate method exists for efficiently isolating all species
 <cit> . in this work the yeasts were isolated using rich media supplemented with glucose, because almost all known yeasts can assimilate this sugar
 <cit> . however, this culture condition could favor the proliferation of yeasts with high metabolic rates, to the detriment of slow-growing yeasts. nevertheless, large numbers and high species diversity were attained in this study . cold-loving yeasts have been isolated mainly from the antarctic and the arctic, and from european and south american glaciers
 <cit> . in all of these environments, the most ubiquitous species are rhodotorula laryngis and cr. victoriae. on the other hand, c. sake, d. fristingensis, g. antarctica and sp. salmonicolor have been isolated only in the southern cone . this work reports for the first time the isolation of cryptococcus gastricus, cryptococcus gilvescens, d. fristingensis and leucosporidiella creatinivora from an antarctic region. also isolated was w. anomalus, which is not generally found in cold regions.

during molecular analysis of the yeasts, most isolates assigned to the same species possessed identical d1/d <dig> and its sequences. thus, combining these rdna regions is a useful technique for rapid identification and typing of yeasts, as others have suggested
 <cit> . however, the isolates identified as leuconeurospora sp. were  <dig> % and  <dig> % different in their d1/d <dig>  and its  sequences, respectively. similarly, the isolates identified as d. fristingensis exhibited identical d1/d <dig>  sequences, but their its  sequences were markedly different , and their overlap was punctuated with several gaps. furthermore, given the physiological differences between isolates that are identical or similar at molecular level, strongly support that the definitions of yeast species must be supplemented by classical characterizations.

most yeast isolates showed lipase activity, consistent with a previous report in which all of the filamentous fungi from antarctica displayed this activity
 <cit> . among the “cold loving” yeasts, lipase activity has been described in pseudozyma antarctica <cit> , leucosporidium antarcticum <cit>  and in species of cryptococcus and rhodotorula <cit> . unlike this last-mentioned study, we detected lipase activity in r. laryngis also. lipase activity has also been described in w. anomalus from tropical environments
 <cit> . the least common extracellular activity was xylanase, observed only in the d. fristingensis isolate. although this activity has been previously described in cryptococcus species
 <cit> , no xylanase activity was observed in the cryptococcus isolates identified here. consistent with our results, protease, amylase and esterase extracellular activities have been reported in several yeast species isolated from cold and tropical environments
 <cit> . however, we present the first report of extracellular amylase activity in le. creatinivora, h. watticus, leuconeurospora sp. and d. fristingensis. in addition to mrakia and rhodotorula species, for which extracellular pectinase activity has been described
 <cit> , we detected pectinase activity in species of wickerhamomyces, metschnikowia, dioszegia, leucosporidiella and candida. all mrakia species isolated in this work showed cellulase activity, which has been previously described in mrakia frigida isolated from king george island
 <cit> ; furthermore, this activity was observed in cryptococcus and dioszegia species, contrary to a previous report
 <cit> . extracellular chitinase activity has been reported in cryptococcus species
 <cit> , but here we observed this activity in m. psychrophila, sp. salmonicolor, metschnikowia sp., leuconeurospora sp. and d. fristingensis. we detected cellulase and chitinase activities in yeasts species that have not been described from cold regions, probably because our sampling sites included areas with vegetation and animal contact and/or were located close to the sea. cellulose is one of the most abundant carbohydrates produced by plants
 <cit>  and chitin is the most abundant renewable polymer in the ocean, where it constitutes an important source of carbon and nitrogen
 <cit> . furthermore, significant quantities of lipids exist in phytoplankton
 <cit>  and in sediments of this region
 <cit> , which can explain the high incidence of lipase activity found in the yeasts. all of the extracellular enzyme activities analyzed in this work are potentially useful to industry: amylases in food processing, fermentation and pharmaceutical industries; cellulases and pectinases in textiles, biofuel processing and clarification of fruit juice; esterase in the agro-food industries; lipases and proteases in food and beverage processing, detergent formulation and environmental bioremediations; chitinases in biocontrol and treatment of chitinous waste; xylanase as a hydrolysis agent in biofuel and solvent industries
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
similar to previous reports of microorganisms isolated from cold environments, the yeasts isolated in this work are predominately psychrotolerant. rapid identification/typing of yeasts was achieved through the use of d1/d <dig> and its regions; however, other physiological and biochemical tests are required for accurate species/strains definition. the diversity of extracellular enzyme activities in the yeasts, and hence the diversity of compounds that may be degraded/transformed, reflects the importance of the yeast community in nutrient recycling in the antarctic regions. in addition, studies about the adaptation of the different yeast species to adverse conditions  could shade light on the evolution of molecular mechanisms , which are implicated in facilitating that accommodation. as an example, changes in protein structure are fundamental to allow conformation of the cytoskeleton, enzyme activity, etc. the antarctic yeast isolates may potentially benefit industrial processes that require a high enzymatic activity at low temperatures, including bread, baking, textile, food, biofuel and brewing industries.
