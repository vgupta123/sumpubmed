BACKGROUND
according to intergovernmental panel on climate change , elevated level of greenhouse gases is one of the primary causes of global warming effect, manifested in rise in sea level by  <dig>  m per decade, including an increase of the upper 75 m by  <dig> °c, and changes in local salinity. these changes are predicted to accelerate if no action is taken  <cit> . changes in habitat temperature have profound effects on life history of fish. the rising sea temperature is predicted to alter the biodynamics of marine organisms, since the temperature accounts for development, growth, recruitment, maturity, distribution and survival of aquatic ectotherms  <cit> . in economical consequence, it will reduce fisheries and cause a geographic shift of aquaculture  <cit> . atlantic cod  is one of the most important species of northern atlantic ocean, both in term of ecology and economy. it has a wide distribution along the coastline of the western atlantic ocean up north of north carolina, eastern atlantic ocean up north from the bay of biscay, and it inhabits open waters of arctic ocean, barents sea, labrador sea, and coastal waters of greenland. populations of atlantic cod follow seasonal migrations, as well as diurnal migration through different layers of a stratified water column in coastal areas, indicating broad temperature adaptation  <cit> . on the other hand, atlantic cod shows high sensitivity to winter warming during the reproductive season  <cit>  and its embryos have rather a narrow thermal window   <cit>  as compared with juveniles and adults   <cit> . in spring, water temperature above 8°c can affect atlantic cod recruitment  <cit> . le bris et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that early-life growth rates might influence migratory behavior of adult cod.

temperature is a major determinant of physiological processes. animals evolved behavioral strategies to cope with the recurrent change in ambient temperature, which affects cellular and molecular mechanisms  <cit> . on the molecular level, regulatory control and response to temperature change can occur at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels  <cit> . to predict the effects of global warming on marine species, molecular mechanisms of acclimation and adaptation to temperature changes need a better understanding. temperature is among the major factors that determine selection of aquaculture sites, breeding programs, and management strategies. cultured fish adjust to the farming environment within their physiological limits. thus, understanding the regulatory mechanism of this adjustment is important for the future success of aquaculture industry in a changing climate. also, knowledge on mechanisms of physiological response to temperature change can improve fish stock projection models  <cit> .

micrornas  are small regulatory molecules mainly involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, largely through translational inhibition and degradation of mrna  <cit> . as regulators of transcriptome, mirnas likely have a significant role in adaptation of organisms to a changing environment. temperature during early stage of the life cycle has persistent effects on the expression patterns of a number of genes and consequently, fish growth  <cit> . such the thermal imprinting has been reported in different fish species  <cit> . the effect of temperature on mirna expression has been demonstrated in few fish species  <cit> . however, the relation between sea temperature elevation and mirna expression has not yet been reported in a marine species. also, there is lack of knowledge about possible long-term effects of thermal experience during early ontogeny on mirna expression.

here, we ask whether the elevated temperature experienced during early life stages affects mirna expression in atlantic cod, a cold water marine teleost. also, we ask whether the temperature during early ontogeny shows long-term effects on mirna repertoire and has epigenetic footprints in mirna promoter regions. we reared embryos and larvae under two temperature regimes, 4°c or  <dig> °c, either continuously or shifted the temperature during the larval development. the temperature difference reflects the maximum predicted change in sea temperature  by year  <dig>  <cit> . as no systematic data are available on mirna repertoire in atlantic cod, we sequenced the small rna constituents using solid next generation sequencing platform and characterized mirnas of atlantic cod during its development. we found that embryonic and/or larval thermal experience has altered mirna profiles during the development, and that long-term effects are manifested by differential mirna expression in juvenile tissues.

mapping of our sequences to the atlantic cod genome resulted in many conserved and previously uncharacterized mirna loci. we identified  <dig> putative mirna precursor loci, which included  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel precursor mirnas. fifty-two loci had multiple locations in the assembled atlantic cod genome . within the conserved precursors, we identified  <dig> types of mature mirnas, which were categorized into  <dig> mirna families .

characterization of mirnas in atlantic cod
characterization of mirnas during the development was performed using sequences obtained from ll group, which represented a default natural temperature conditions. many mirnas showed differential expression among investigated developmental stages. clustering of mirnas based on the expression pattern during the development resulted in  <dig> groups: mirnas relatively highly expressed before and during maternal-zygotic-transition, mzt , during organogenesis , and during metamorphosis  .figure  <dig> schematic representation of expression patterns of mirnas during early development of atlantic cod. group i mirnas are highly expressed before and during mzt and then decrease; group ii mirnas are highly expressed during organogenesis; and group iii mirnas are highly expressed during the transition from larval to adult forms. only selected mirnas are depicted; see additional file  <dig> for the full set of mirnas.



although the diversity of mirnas among tissues was comparable, their expression patterns were subdivided into  <dig> dendrograms in a tissue-specific manner regardless of temperature regimes . number of differentially expressed mirnas varied among tissues . some mirnas were specifically abundant in a given tissue type; for example, mir- <dig>  mir-124a, and mir- <dig> in the brain; mir- <dig> and mir-7a in the pituitary; mir- <dig> in gonads; and mir- <dig> in the liver .figure  <dig> number of differentially expressed mirnas between atlantic cod tissues. pairwise comparison between different tissues using noiseq with probability of differential expression a) q >  <dig>  and b) q >  <dig> .



effect of water temperature on mirna expression in embryos and larvae
the expression levels of  <dig> mirna families  were altered by the change in water temperature . during the late blastula stage, the transcript level of mir-130b and mir- <dig> was lower in embryos incubated at  <dig> °c than at 4°c . similarly, other mirnas  had lower abundance in embryos incubated at  <dig> °c during early somite formation. at hatch, the expression level of  <dig> mirnas  was higher, and  <dig> mirnas  was lower in embryos incubated at  <dig> °c compared to 4°c .figure  <dig> differential expression of mirnas during atlantic cod embryonic development under four temperature regimes, based on pair-wise comparison between treatments. *indicates significant q-value, which is the probability of differential expression, >  <dig> . ll, lh, hl, and hh are temperature regimes described in methods. c, bl, es, ha, st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> represent cleavage, blastula, early somitogenesis, hatch, stage  <dig> larvae, stage  <dig> larvae, and stage  <dig> larvae developmental stages, respectively.



during larval development,  <dig> mirnas showed differential expression  including  <dig> mirnas in stage  <dig> larvae ;  <dig> mirnas in stage  <dig>  larvae ; and  <dig> mirnas in stage  <dig>  larvae .

long-term effect of water temperature on mirna expression levels in juvenile atlantic cod
sequencing was performed separately for males and females, but no significant differences were found between the sexes within a treatment group. fourteen mirnas were differentially expressed among the treatment groups in pituitary, liver, and gonad . no significant differential expression was found in brain.figure  <dig> long-term effects of elevated temperature in early ontogeny on mirna expression in juvenile atlantic cod depend on timing. elevation of temperature during either embryo incubation or larval rearing  affects different sets of mirnas, with the exception of mir- <dig>  differential expression  is given in relation to low temperature group, with the exception of mir-200a, where expression is differential in relation to high temperature group .



the timing of temperature elevation during early ontogeny was important for differential expression pattern of mirnas in juvenile atlantic cod. here, timing refers to whether the temperature was elevated during embryo incubation  or later on, during larval rearing . except for mir- <dig>  the remaining  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed either in hh or lh groups, but not in both. interestingly, when compared to the low temperature group, elevated temperature during embryo incubation resulted in up-regulation while elevated temperature during larval rearing resulted in down-regulation of differentially expressed mirnas in liver .

to test the reliability of noiseq-simulated technical replicates, we performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr  on liver samples of 10 g juveniles from  <dig> individuals  per each treatment. we observed very similar expression pattern between the ngs analysis  and the rt-qpcr results for mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-451a ; however, the amplification of mir-7a was low with ct values >  <dig> figure  <dig> rt-qpcr result for selected mirnas. expression value were normalized against mir-122-5p. vertical bars represent standard deviation . *** stand for p <  <dig> . for the detail descriptions of ll, lh, and hh see methods.



dna methylation at upstream regions of mirna genes
we aimed to explore cpg methylation up to  <dig>  bp upstream of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas for possible epigenetic footprints. however, due to incompleteness of the sequenced atlantic cod genome and fragmentary nature of its assembly, our analysis was restricted to  <dig> upstream regions of pre-mirnas. in  <dig> pre-mirnas upstream regions, there were too few cpg sites to perform methylation pattern analysis, or as in the case of mir-132a where the cpgs were located in the middle of thymidine stretches resulting in sequence ambiguity . thus, the remaining two upstream regions  were amplified in both bisulfite-treated and -untreated dna by their respective primer pairs. methylation status of these upstream regions in stage  <dig> larvae was mostly inconclusive. a notable exception was a single site at −153 bp upstream of pre-mir-27c, which was unmethylated in ll larvae, methylated in hh larvae, and methylated in some larvae in the hl and lh groups . then, we analyzed tissue-specific methylation in later developmental stages. the upstream region of let-7h gene in the liver of 10 g juvenile had no differential methylation pattern among the treatment groups and resembled the pattern observed in stage  <dig> larvae . we found the methylation pattern of upstream region of mir-27c gene, which was differentially expressed in juvenile gonads , did not show any difference between temperature groups in 3-year-old adult gonad .

discussion
characterization of mirna during atlantic cod early development
we have identified a number of conserved mirnas, and characterized several species-specific mirnas, during early development of atlantic cod. this report provides a systematic characterization of mirna in this species, which expands the previous mature mirna profiling in selected developmental stages and liver  <cit> . although multiple mirna loci could be an attribute of fragmentary nature of atlantic cod genome assembly  <cit> , a majority  of our putative precursor mirnas are found in the scaffolds, indicating that these loci are most likely paralogs, as reported for salmonids  <cit> .

the expression pattern of some specific mirnas in the present study is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . some mirnas had high expression level before zygotic genome activation, indicating their maternal origin, as reported in flies  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , and fish  <cit> . also, mir- <dig> expression was high during the early development, indicating the relevance of this mirna during cleavages. in mammals, mir- <dig> expression is significantly higher in embryonic stem cells compared to differentiated cells  <cit> . in zebrafish, the maternal-to-zygotic transition  occurs during mid-blastula stage, but it is not exactly delineated in atlantic cod. however, similarly to zebrafish  <cit> , peak in mir- <dig> expression in atlantic cod was at the blastula stage, suggesting similar mzt window.

in atlantic cod early development, mir- <dig> family had the highest expression during somitogenesis, and other mirnas, such as mir-27b and mir- <dig> were highly expressed in yolk sac larvae. previous reports indicate that mir- <dig> family is essential for normal development; in particular, mir-20a has a function in skeletogenesis  <cit> , and mir-27b and mir- <dig>  identified as proangiogenic mirna in zebrafish, promote development of intersegmental blood vessels  <cit> . high expression mir-103/ <dig> in atlantic cod during hatching indicates the importance in the initiation of the digestive tract development as the enrichment of these mirnas in gut is reported in zebrafish  <cit> . in the present study, high level of mir-125b and mir-181a in hatched larvae and during further development may be associated with the developmental advancement of different organs as shown in zebrafish and other systems  <cit> .

the expression of several mirnas in atlantic cod tissues was in agreement with previous reports in homologous tissues of vertebrates. the enrichment of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in a developing and mature central nerve system  is reported in fish  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , amphibians  <cit>  and birds  <cit> . atlantic cod pituitary was enriched with mir- <dig>  which is also highly expressed in mouse intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland  <cit> . in this study, we found very high expression of mir- <dig> in gonads, which is in agreement with previous reports in atlantic halibut  <cit>  and rainbow trout  <cit> , indicating possible functional conservation in developing gonads.

effect of temperature on mirna expression
although our sampling strategy  reduced the discrepancy that could arise from allometric growth of different cell types/tissues, the observed differences in mirna expression between the two temperature groups should be interpreted cautiously. some of the differences in mirna expression could be an effect of heterochrony resulting in slight modification in the respective time of gene activation.

lower expression of mir-130b and mir- <dig> in the higher incubation temperature, observed in this study, may partly explain the observed delay of epiboly and closure of the blastopore in atlantic cod embryos incubated at 10°c compared to  <dig> or 7°c  <cit> . mir-130b is involved in promoting cell proliferation  <cit> , which is an important heterochronic process during the epiboly and prior to somite formation. one of the functions of mir- <dig> is balancing the agonistic  and antagonistic  ligands during embryogenesis  <cit> , which are essential for left-right patterning, initiation of germ layers and establishing of distinct cell fates in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> . mir- <dig> expression starts after zygotic genome activation, which is triggered, at least in zebrafish, by nanog, pou5f <dig>  and soxb <dig> transcriptional factors  <cit> . previous report showed no significant difference in the expression of nanog and pou <dig> between atlantic cod embryos incubated at 6°c and 10°c  <cit> . therefore, difference in mr- <dig> expression between the two temperature groups in the present study may not be at the transcriptional level; alternatively, other transcriptional factors that are involved in the transcription of mir- <dig> cluster are affected by change in temperature.

vertebrate mirnas are involved in regulation of gastrulation and somitogenesis  <cit> . lowered expression of mir- <dig> in hh group might have a phenotypic effect, since atlantic cod embryos incubated at 10°c had shorter body axis than those incubated at 4°c  <cit> . in zebrafish, balanced concentration of mir- <dig> is essential for the mir-206/snail/e-cadherin signaling in the control of convergence and extension movements during gastrulation, which contribute to narrowing and lengthening of the forming embryonic axis  <cit> . earlier report indicated prevalence of severe vertebral curvature and shortened tails of atlantic cod larvae occurring after incubation of embryos at above 9°c  <cit> . however, we did not observe any severe deformities in hh group compared with lh; in contrast, ll group fish had more deformities compared with ll and hh groups at juvenile stage . in zebrafish, mir- <dig> family, a member of mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster, regulates both retinoic acid metabolism during early somitogenesis and axis formation  <cit> . in this study, members of mir-17 ~ 92: mir- <dig>  mir-18c, mir-19b, and mir-20a, had lower expression in hh group during early somites stage, indicating the effect of temperature on somitogenesis. in senegalese sole  at  <dig> somites stage, higher expression of mir-130c and mir-181a-3p was reported in embryos incubated at lower temperature  compared with higher temperature   <cit> . thus, the observed differences between ll and hh groups in this study suggest the possible temperature-dependent modulation of mirna expression.

transfer of larvae from low to high temperature  changed the expression profile of  <dig> mirnas. these mirnas are implied in neuronal development, endocrine development, adipogenesis, angiogenesis and bone formation . among these  <dig> mirnas, only mir- <dig> has been implicated in stabilization of gene expression to temperature fluctuation in flies  <cit> . however, role of these mirnas in relation to temperature is not yet explored in vertebrates.

temperature is known to have an influence on the size and number of embryonic muscle fibers  <cit> . hall and johnston  <cit>  have reported significant change in muscle cellularity with more white fibers in atlantic cod embryos incubated at 10°c compared to those incubated at lower temperature. in this study, lower temperature  promoted mir- <dig> expression during larval development, which may imply the role of mir- <dig> in muscle cellularity.

long-term effect of incubation temperature during embryonic and larval stages on mirna expression in juveniles
incubation temperature experienced in early life stages showed long-term effects on the expression of some mirnas in pituitary, gonads and liver, but not in brain of juveniles . the lack of incubation temperature effects in brain is in agreement with a report that has shown unaltered mirnas expression in the brain tissue of cold-acclimatized zebrafish  <cit> . however, given that brain has several anatomical and functionally distinct parts, this result is inconclusive.

long-term effects of temperature were time-dependent, as different sets of mirnas were differentially expressed in the hh group  and in the lh group . it indicates that a time-specific window predominantly exists for temperature-induced long-term changes in mirna expression during atlantic cod development. intriguingly, only three out of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in 10 g fish  were among mirnas differentially expressed during either embryonic or larval stages . it indicates that temperature-induced response in altered mirna expression is mostly prolonged in time, and it suggests an epigenetic mechanism. our effort to identify dna methylation-based regulatory network for mirnas was mostly inconclusive, owing to lack of good atlantic cod genome assembly and thereby limiting the number of mirnas examined. however, we found apparent differences in methylation status at −153 bp of mir-27c gene in stage  <dig> larvae, unmethylated in ll group and methylated in hh group  and this corresponds well with highly significant down-regulation in mir-27c expression in a juvenile gonad in hh group . using transcription factor binding site database  <cit> , we predicted transcriptional factor gata <dig> to bind at positions − <dig> to −154 bp  up-stream of mir-27c gene. this may indicate epigenetic modulation of mir-27c expression by temperature. however, more experimental evidence is needed to support a hypothesis on epigenetic modulation of temperature-induced differential mirna expression. mir- <dig> was the only exception from the time-specific window for temperature-dependent modulation of mirna expression, as it was affected in both hh and lh groups . moreover, it was altered directly during the treatment at stage  <dig> larvae . mir- <dig> is involved in immune response  <cit>  and since temperature is a determinant in atlantic cod immune response  <cit> , the response to temperature likely follows wide time-sensitive window during the development.

the elevation of temperature during larval development influenced the expression of let-7 h, mir-7a, mir-34c, mir-132a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the liver of a juvenile atlantic cod, in all cases producing down-regulation in comparison to ll group. the functions of these mirnas in fish liver during the development, as well as functions in temperature response are unknown.

elevation of embryonic incubation temperature resulted in alteration of expression of several mirnas in juvenile organs. three mirnas were up-regulated in the liver , including mir- <dig>  which is involved in metabolic pathways in rat  <cit> ; mir- <dig>  which promotes erythroid maturation in zebrafish  <cit> ; and mir- <dig>  which is implicated in embryonic angiogenesis in zebrafish  <cit> . however, their functions in the liver are unknown. the two mirnas, mir-27c and mir-30c, which were expressed differentially in gonads, have not been implicated in gonad development yet. in human pituitary, mir-449a plays an important role in stress response  <cit> . temperature elevation could produce stress response and in consequence long-term alteration of mir-449a expression in pituitary in hh group fish. embryonic thermal experience affects later growth performance in atlantic salmon   <cit> . thus, the observed difference in expression of several mirnas in the present study might be related to metabolic pathways and are likely to influence the growth performance of atlantic cod. in addition, many of these mirnas are also involved in immune-related pathways .

CONCLUSIONS
we provided a systematic identification and characterization of mirnas during atlantic cod development in order to elucidate the effect of temperature during early life stages on mirna expression. we found that several mirnas show temperature-dependent differential expression during the development. moreover, we found that temperature during early life stages had long-term effects manifested in differential expression of a number of mirnas in juveniles, and these effects were inducible predominantly in a narrow time-specific window during the development. our results indicate that thermal experience during early ontogeny has long-lasting consequences in regulation of biological processes in atlantic cod, but it is unclear whether this effect is modulated by an epigenetic mechanism.
