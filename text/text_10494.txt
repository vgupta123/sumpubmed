BACKGROUND
wheat  is one of the most important grain crops in the world. with a global output of  <dig> million tons in  <dig>  bread wheat accounts for 20% of the calories consumed by humans
 <cit> . it is well known that wheat grain proteins are classified into two major categories: non-prolamins, including water-soluble albumins, and salt-soluble globulins and prolamins, including gliadins and glutenins. gliadins and glutenins are the major storage proteins in wheat endosperm, are closely related to the viscoelastic properties of dough, and influence the processing and rheological properties of wheat flour
 <cit> . albumins and globulins, which include various enzymes and their inhibitors that play important roles in plant growth and development, are soluble proteins
 <cit> . these proteins are relatively well balanced for human nutrition because of their high level of essential amino acids such as lysine, tryptophan, and methionine
 <cit> .

the development of the caryopsis can be broadly divided into three main phases: division and expansion, grain filling and maturation, and desiccation
 <cit> . proteins and carbohydrates that accumulate during seed development are essential reserves to support germination and early seedling growth as well as a major source of food for humans and animals. because the quality of wheat is largely determined by events occurring during grain development, understanding protein synthesis and regulation during grain development is of fundamental importance for the improvement of wheat quality. starch and storage proteins are two major components stored in wheat grains. they show similar patterns of accumulation and their deposition is observed during the grain-filling period between about  <dig> and 28 days post-anthesis  in the hereward cultivar
 <cit> . based on the diameter, mature wheat endosperm contains a-type , b-type , and c-type  starch granules. however, the c-type granules are so small that they are hardly isolated from the b-type, which commonly leads to them being classified as b-type granules
 <cit> . the a-type granules, which continue to increase in size from the early stage in grain development until maturation, constitute approximately 70% of the volume and 10% of the total number of granules
 <cit> , while b and c-type granules that increase in size during the middle and late stages, respectively, account for about 30% of the volume and 90% of the total number of granules
 <cit> .

transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have provided insights into the mechanism of reserve accumulation during wheat grain development
 <cit> . however, poor correlation was observed between the accumulation of a large proportion of proteins and their corresponding mrnas expression profiles in wheat
 <cit>  as well as among other plant species such as arabidopsis <cit>  and rice
 <cit> . hence, proteome approaches provide a more valuable tool for monitoring developmental profiles and have been widely used in studies of maize
 <cit>  and rice
 <cit> . extensive research has been conducted to investigate protein synthesis and accumulation, and a number of proteomic studies have focused on identifying the array of proteins in developing wheat grains. recent studies of different grain developing stages
 conducted using proteomic approaches have provided valuable information for the interpretation of the biochemical processes of wheat grain development, and most of them have been performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis 
 <cit>  and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis 
 <cit> . however, 2d-gel–based approaches have several limitations such as low identification rate of proteins, lack of accurate quantification of diffident proteins, low reproducibility and difficult separation of hydrophobic proteins
 <cit> . as a powerful technique to perform quantitative proteome analysis, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation  allows identification of more numerous proteins and can provide more reliable quantitative information than traditional 2-de analysis
 <cit> . in addition, with a sufficient number of proteins it is possible to conduct pathway and protein-protein interaction analyses
 <cit> . the first shotgun proteomics study in wheat by itraq was performed for investigating the protein responses to drought
 <cit> . recently, a metabolic pathway of wheat seedling growth under hydrogen peroxide stress was revealed by itraq-based quantitative proteomic analysis
 <cit> . to date, however, quantitative proteomics studies on wheat grain development based on itraq analysis have not been reported.

it is well known that protein phosphorylation is one of the most common and important post-translational modifications . a large number of biological processes are regulated by protein phosphorylation, including metabolism, transcription and translation, protein degradation, homeostasis, and cellular signaling and communication
 <cit> . recently, phosphoproteomic analysis has been carried out to elucidate plant growth, development, and diverse response mechanisms in different plants such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , maize
 <cit> , rice
 <cit> , brachypodium distachyon <cit> , and wheat
 <cit> . these investigations showed that many stress-related proteins were phosphorylated under diverse conditions, suggesting the important role of protein phosphorylation in response to various stresses. in addition, phosphorylation can also activate some enzymes involved in starch synthesis and increase the physical interactions between those enzymes
 <cit> .

in this study, we performed the first itraq-based quantitative proteome and protein phosphorylation analysis during grain development of elite chinese bread wheat cultivar yanyou  <dig>  our results have revealed the central metabolism changes involved in wheat grain development and provide new insights into the grain development pathways, particularly for starch and protein synthesis as well as adverse defense mechanisms.

protein identification and quantification
in this study, itraq-based quantitative proteome characterization during grain development of the yanyou  <dig> cultivar was investigated to reveal the central metabolic proteins involved in wheat grain development. a global profiling of quantitative proteome was obtained on whole developing caryopses from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa using three biological replicates. overall, more than  <dig>  unique peptides , corresponding to  <dig>  proteins were identified , of which  <dig>  proteins with quantitative information were elicited. according to false discovery rate  < <dig>  and unique peptide numbers ≥ <dig>   <dig>  non-redundant proteins were obtained . before comparison analysis of proteins expression levels, pearson correlation between three replicates was performed to determine the analytical reproducibility . a 45°-diagonal line was obtained with little variation throughout the detection range, which demonstrates the expected distribution without obvious changes between the biological replicates.

protein expression profiles during different grain development
a 2-fold cut-off was used to implicate significant changes in the abundance of differentially expressed proteins  during grain development. of  <dig>  non-redundant proteins identified,  <dig> showed more than 2-fold changes  in protein expression level in at least one of the development stages and, therefore, they were identified as deps. their detailed information is provided in additional file
5: table s3-a, and  <dig> representative protein ms spectra are shown in additional file
6: figure s <dig>  the distributions of  <dig> deps and their overlapping during different grain developmental stages illustrated using the venn diagram analysis are shown in figure 
 <dig>  a total of  <dig> deps were down-regulated under at least one development stage , including 31deps at all development stages,  <dig> deps at two stages , while three,  <dig>  and  <dig> deps particularly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa,  <dig> dpa, and  <dig> dpa, respectively. as indicated in figure 
2b, among  <dig> up-regulated deps,  <dig> deps were shared by all development stages,  <dig> deps shared by two stages , while  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> deps particularly up-regulated at  <dig> dpa,  <dig> dpa, and  <dig> dpa, respectively.

in general, six clearly different expression patterns during grain development were generalized among  <dig> deps :  <dig> deps  in up-regulation,  <dig>  in down-regulation,  <dig>  in up- to down-regulation,  <dig>  in down- to up-regulation,  <dig>  in down- to up- to down-regulation, and  <dig>  in up- to down- to up-regulation.figure  <dig>

functional classification and sub-cellular localization of deps
according to the molecular functions listed on the uniprot and gene ontology website, the  <dig> deps were classified into nine functional categories . these nine functional protein categories were involved in metabolism , stress/defense , transcription/translation , storage proteins , protein synthesis/assembly , transportation , photosynthesis , signal transduction , and unknown function . a fischer’s enrichment analysis was carried out on the subsets characterized by different expression patterns with those of the whole list of quantified proteins as reference list. as a result , "protein maturation"  was significantly over-represented in up-regulation subset, "translation"  was significantly over-represented in down-regulation subset, "biosynthetic process"  and "cellular protein modification process"  were significantly over-represented in up-to-down-regulation subset. there was no statistically significant result in other three subsets.figure  <dig> 
functional classifications  and sub-cellular localization  of  <dig> deps identified in the developing grains.




subcellular localizations of the  <dig> identified proteins were predicted using gene ontology  and wolf psort . as result showed in figure 
3b,  <dig> % of deps were located in the plasma membrane,  <dig> % in the cytoplasm, and  <dig> % in the ribosome, but  <dig> % were unknown.

differential protein expression during grain development
hierarchical clustering analysis  was performed to display the dynamic expression patterns of  <dig> deps involved in carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis , protein metabolism and storage proteins , and defense/stress .figure  <dig> 
hirerarchical clustering analysis of deps with different functions during grain development. a: deps involved in carbohydrate metabolism related proteins, including starch synthesis , beta-amylases , photosynthesis  and other carbohydrate metabolism . b: deps involved in protein metabolism, including nitrogen metabolism , protein systhesis/assembly/degradation  and storage proteins . c: deps involved in defense and stress related proteins, including alpha-amylase inhibitor , lea proteins , ros scavenging related proteins , protein protection  and other defense/stress related proteins .



totally,  <dig> deps involved in carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis were divided into four function groups , including starch biosynthesis , beta-amylases , photosynthesis , and other carbohydrate metabolism . in group i,  <dig> important enzymes were involved in starch biosynthesis, including five adp-glucose pyrophosophorylases , two sucrose synthases , four starch branching enzymes , and one starch synthase  ii-d . most of them showed a significant accumulation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. for example, three agpases  were more than 2-fold up-regulated at  <dig> dpa, and had the highest expression level at  <dig> dpa. two susy i1gs <dig> and q <dig> increased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> dpa, respectively, and reached the highest level at  <dig> dpa. starch synthase ii-d  had a  <dig> -fold expression level at  <dig> dpa and continuously increased to  <dig> dpa. however, starch branching enzyme  was initiated later, and 2-fold expression changes were observed after  <dig> dpa . the group ii included  <dig> beta-amylases related to the hydrolysis of starch, in which seven  displayed up-regulated expression during grain development and reached the highest accumulation level at  <dig> dpa, while three  were down-regulated . nine proteins involved in photosynthesis, such as ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase  large chain , small chain  and phosphoglycerate kinase , which were generally downregulated, were placed into group iii . the remaining  <dig> deps involved in other carbohydrate metabolism processes were included in group iv, in which  <dig> showed apparently up-regulation, such as alcohol dehydrogenase adh1a , adh2a , and the others displayed up-down and down-regulation during grain development .

as shown in figure 
4b, the  <dig> deps involved in protein metabolism were divided into three functional groups, including nitrogen metabolism , protein synthesis/assembly/degradation , and storage proteins . the group i contained  <dig> deps involved in nitrogen metabolism, of which only three were up-regulated, including two aspartate aminotransferases  and one porphobilinogen deaminase , and  <dig> of them were down-regulated, such as two glutamine synthetase  . in group ii,  <dig> deps related to protein synthesis/assembly/degradation had different expression patterns; among them, five  demonstrated an up-regulated expression pattern and had the highest expression level at  <dig> dpa, four deps, including protein disulfide isomerases  , elongation factor- <dig> alpha , and vacuolar processing enzyme 2a , displayed up-down expression and had the highest level at the middle development stages, while the others were down-regulated. in group iii,  <dig> storage proteins showed up-regulated expression patterns during grain development, particularly with a significantly higher expression level at later grain development stages, including five high molecular weight glutenin subunits , two low molecular weight glutenin subunits , five avenin-like a, three gliadins, seven globulins, and seven others. seven of them were significantly altered with more than 5-fold changes at  <dig> dpa , of which 19 kda globulin  increased by  <dig> -fold and two lmw-gs  increased by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively. all five hmw-gs showed more than 3-fold increase at  <dig> dpa .

the  <dig> deps involved in stress/defense were divided into five functional groups , including alpha-amylase inhibitors  , late embryogenesis abundant proteins  , ros scavenging system , protein protection , and others . in group i and group ii,  <dig> αai and  <dig> lea proteins had the highest expression at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> were more than 5-fold upregulated, including eight αai  and two lea proteins . the group iii contained nine deps involved in the ros scavenging system, including up-regulated catalase , peroxidase , peroxiredoxin , 1-cys peroxiredoxin per <dig> , and glutathione transferase  , down-regulated catalase , and down-up regulated thioredoxin  and gt . the group iv included five serpin proteins , one chymotrypsin inhibitor wci  , and five hot shock proteins  , which were involved in protecting proteins from degradation. all the five serpins and cti were up-regulated during grain development, and particularly serpins colf <dig> and cti  were up-regulated by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> dpa, respectively. among the five hsps, hsp  <dig>  and hsp <dig>   were up-regulated and had 2- and  <dig> -fold level changes at  <dig> dpa, respectively. hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  had the highest expression level at  <dig> dpa with  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increase, respectively, after which they were sharply down-regulated. hsp <dig>  was sharply down-regulated by  <dig> -fold at  <dig> dpa, and then showed a slight up-regulated expression . the group v had  <dig> deps, which were mainly involved in cell wall protection, insect and pathogen resistance, osmotic and cold stresses, among which  <dig> showed significant up-regulated expression and reached the highest expression level at  <dig> dpa .

transcriptional expression analysis as revealed by qrt-pcr
to provide further information of the correspondence between proteins and their mrna expression patterns, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  was performed to investigate the dynamic transcriptional expression patterns of  <dig> representative deps. the high amplification efficiency of each primer pair was determined by standard curves using serial  <dig> dpa cdna. dilutions and unique melting temperature peaks of each specific primer are shown in additional file
8: figure s <dig>  as shown in figure 
 <dig>  three genes encoding beta-amylase, alcohol dehydrogenase adh1a, and ss ii-d displayed the same expression patterns with their protein levels, seven genes encoding sbe i, agpase ssu, gliadin/avenin-like seed protein, non-special lipid transfer protein, αai, serpin, and peroxidase showed similar expression patterns at three developmental stages with their protein expression patterns. however, two genes encoding fructose bisphosphate aldolase and catalase showed opposed expression patterns with their proteins. researches demonstrated that the mrna level and protein abundance of fructose bisphosphate aldolase is not consistent due to translational or post-translational regulation
 <cit> , and the expression of catalase is regulated by post-transcriptional regulation
 <cit> . these results are generally consistent with those of a previous report
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

phosphorylated proteins characterization during grain development
the strategy of tio <dig> affinity chromatography combined with lc-ms/ms and maxquant software was used to identify phosphopeptides and phosphorylated sites in developing grains at  <dig> dpa. in total,  <dig> phosphopeptides with  <dig> phosphorylated sites belonging to  <dig> phosphoproteins were identified. of the  <dig> phosphoproteins,  <dig> containing  <dig> phosphopeptides and  <dig> phosphorylated sites were also detected by itraq. the detailed description of these  <dig> phosphoproteins and their expression patterns are shown in additional file
5: table s3-c. twenty-nine representative ms spectra are shown in additional file
9: figure s <dig> 

on the basis of the phosphorylation site probability, the  <dig> phosphorylation sites belonged to class i , in which  <dig> serines and  <dig> threonines were phosphorylated. the biological functions of these phosphoproteins are mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism , defense and stress , and protein synthesis .

among the  <dig> phosphoproteins identified, four deps including serpin-n <dig>  , serpin-z2a , and heat shock protein  <dig>  contained four phosphorylation sites; two deps: lea <dig> protein , wail <dig>  had three phosphorylation sites; five deps including agpase , phosphorylase , lea <dig> protein , serpin  <dig> , and serpin-z1a  contained two phosphorylation sites; and the remaining phosphoproteins contained one phosphorylation site . in particular, five deps related to starch biosynthesis were found to be phosphorylated, including  <dig> agpase  and one susy . in addition, three lea proteins , four serpins , and hsp <dig> , which participate in defense pathways and other various biological processes, were also phosphorylated.

the partial sequence alignment of five serpins  showed few amino acid differences . both c0lf <dig> and q <dig> contained two conserved phosphorylation sites at thr <dig> and ser <dig>  while the other two serpins  had four phosphorylation sites at thr <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  suggesting that these phosphorylation sites were highly conserved in the serpin family. the 3d structures of serpin  <dig>  and serpin-n <dig>  , which were predicted using phyre
 <cit> , are shown in figure 
6b. the phosphorylation sites at thr <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig> were located at the n-termini, β-sheets s1a, and α-helices hf, marked according to fluhr et al. <cit> , respectively. one representative ms/ms spectra map of the common phosphopeptide _attlatdvr_ present in the four phosphorylated proteins is shown in figure

protein-protein interaction analysis of deps
the protein-protein interaction  network of the deps identified in the current study was analyzed using string. in total,  <dig> eukaryotic orthologous groups  representing  <dig> deps involved in seven functional categories were used to construct the ppi network . to improve the reliability of the ppi analysis, the confidence score was set to the high level . as shown in additional file
10: figure s <dig>  a complex ppi network contained  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, was displayed through cytoscape. seven chaperones involved in protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, defense/stress, and other important functions were identified by itraq analysis, which included five hsps , one scp , and one pdi . they were used to further extract the potential interacting proteins from the whole ppi network, and a chaperones-centered sub-network was constructed , which indicated a complicated interaction network among chaperones and other deps. a total of  <dig> kogs representing  <dig> proteins  involved in transcription/translation, protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, defense/stress, and carbohydrate metabolism and transport could interact with the chaperones detected in this work. in particular,  <dig> kogs were essential proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as elongation factor tu  and aspartate aminotransferase , and  <dig> deps were important for defense/stress and ros scavenging system, such as cat, prx, xi, gt, and trx.figure  <dig>

discussion
wheat endosperm is an allohexaploid tissue in which 80–85% of the extractable proteins are gliadins and glutenins. the albumins and globulins of wheat endosperm have received relatively little attention because of their low abundance and perceived secondary role in flour quality. in the current study, itraq-based quantitative proteome analysis detected the dynamic changes of  <dig> deps at four developmental stages of wheat grains, including considerable albumins and globulins that are generally expressed at low levels. the identified deps were much more numerous than those discovered in previous reports with traditional 2-de and 2d-dige approaches
 <cit> . these deps were mainly involved in starch and protein synthesis as well as defense/stress; in particular, some functionally important proteins were phosphorylated, suggesting their key roles in grain development.

starch biosynthesis and accumulation during grain development
as one of the two major wheat grain store components, starch constitutes approximately 70% of mature grain dry weight. starch is synthesized and accumulated by the coordinated roles of a group of enzymes whose activities are positively correlated to starch accumulation rate
 <cit> . in that precious work, only a limited number of starch synthesis enzymes were detected in developing wheat grains using the traditional 2-de method
 <cit> . through the itraq-based quantitative proteomic approach used in this study, considerable key enzymes related to seed starch biosynthesis were identified, and  <dig>  deps among  <dig> were located in the cytoplasm and related to starch metabolism , thus providing a comprehensive view of starch biosynthesis during wheat grain development.

it is generally accepted that the grain-filling rate in cereals is mainly determined by sink strength, which could be increased by the high activity of susy
 <cit> . two susys were found to be up-regulated and reached the highest level at  <dig> dpa, which is similar to the change of chlorophyll content . as the senility and photosynthetic rate declined of flag leaves, the supply of sugars to grain decreased, which could led to down-regulation of susys. at early grain stage, photosynthesis provides the raw material triosephosphate for starch biosynthesis, and plays a role in maintaining the endogenous o <dig> balance
 <cit> . our results showed that ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase  and phosphoglycerate kinase , which are essential for photosynthesis, had higher expression levels at early grain development stages, and reached the highest levels at  <dig> dpa , which would promote plant photosynthesis and grain filling.

grain development is the process of starch biosynthesis and accumulation in endosperm cells. sucrose is constantly split into udp-glucose by susy and used for starch synthesis. starch biosynthesis is initiated with a substrate of adp-glucose  formed by agpase, which is regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme in starch biosynthesis
 <cit> . the adp-glu is transported into the cytoplasm by adp-glucose brittle- <dig> transporter 
 <cit> . different classes of ss are recruited to elongate the glucan chain, including ss i–iv and granule bind starch synthase , while sbes are involved in forming alpha- <dig> -glucoside and dbe hydrolyzes α--linkages within a polyglucan
 <cit> . almost all the enzymes related to starch synthesis were detected in our study, except for gbss and dbe; most of these enzymes showed the highest expression level at  <dig> dpa, except for agpase small subunit , which was down-regulated, and sbei, which showed the highest expression level at  <dig> dpa. this is consistent with the rapid increase of grain weight and starch granules .

recent studies have showed that starch biosynthesis is mainly regulated by protein post-translational modifications, especially by phosphorylation
 <cit> . previous studies proved that the wheat starch synthesis enzymes such as ssi, ssii-a, sbei, sbeii-a, and sbeii-b could be phosphorylated and participate in protein-protein interactions, and their activity could be enhanced by phosphorylation
 <cit> . some of the enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis have been found to form protein complexes such as ss-sbe complexes
 <cit>  and agpase-starch phosphorylase complexes
 <cit> . particularly, starch synthase catalytic domain is mainly responsible for glucan-substrate recognition and affinity
 <cit> . thus, the phosphorylation sites in the starch synthase catalytic domain may play an important role in recognizing and attracting glucan substrates. previous reports found that many proteins related to starch metabolism were phosphorylated, such as at ser- <dig> in agpase small subunit, thr- <dig> in agpase large subunit, and thr-330/ <dig> and ser-543/ <dig> in ss iii
 <cit> . in the current study, two agpase large subunits , two small subunits , one susy , and bt <dig>  were found to be phosphorylated in the developing grains .

our results provided dynamic changes and phosphorylated protein characterization of the deps involved in starch synthesis . starch biosynthesis includes two main stages: glucan initiation and starch synthesis. firstly, photosynthesis and sucrose hydrolysis provide the raw materials that are transformed into glucose-1-phosphate  by a series of enzymes; then, g1p is catalyzed into adp-glu by agpase. adp-glu is carried to amyloplasts by bt <dig> and begins starch synthesis. adp-glu is elongated by gbss and ss i-iv for amylase and amylopectin synthesis, respectively. sbe and dbe are involved in catalyzing the formation of α--linkages within the polymers and hydrolyzing α--linkages within a polyglucan to regularize the branching and maintain amylopectin crystallinity. most of the enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis were identified in our work and showed a peak expression at  <dig> dpa, well consistent with the rapid increase of grain sizes and starch granules at 14– <dig> dpa . some deps essential for starch biosynthesis were phosphorylated in the developing grains, which could increase the interaction between starch synthesis enzymes and enhance their activity to promote starch biosynthesis.figure  <dig> 
an overview of the starch biosynthesis processes in wheat endosperm. the starch biosynthesis includes sucrose degradation pathway, photosynthesis pathway as the raw materials source and starch biosynthesis pathway, and consists of two distinct phases: the glucan initiation process and the starch amplification process. adpg is mainly synthesized by the cytosolic agpase ssu and lsu, or supplied by sucrose degradation. the subsequent mechanisms underlying the glucan initiation process remain to be established. branched dextrins are putatively processed by the coordinated activities of ss, be, and/or dbe to produce the prototype of an amylopectin cluster structure, which further develops into amylopectin to establish the basic structure. amylose is mainly synthesized by gbss. two agpase ssu, two agpase lsu and one susy were phosphorylated. the protein levels are shown in coloured squares, indicating the change of expression for each developmental stage.



protein synthesis and accumulation during grain development
cereal grains provide 50% of the dietary protein for humans and represent 70% of the protein intake for people in developing countries
 <cit> . therefore, nitrogen assimilation and protein synthesis are very important for wheat grain development. previous research attested the key role of glutamine synthetase  in plant nitrogen metabolism
 <cit> . gs is responsible for the first step of ammonium assimilation and transformation into glutamine and glutamate, which are essential compounds in the amino acid biosynthetic pathway. cytosolic gs has multiple metabolic functions such as assimilating ammonia into glutamine for transport and distribution throughout the plant. recent studies have highlighted the important roles of gs <dig> cytosolic isoenzymes for nitrogen management linked to yield establishment and seed filling in monocotyledonous crops
 <cit> . our study demonstrated that two gs proteins  showed a higher expression level at  <dig> dpa , which could contribute to glutenin synthesis and improve gluten quality in the yanyou  <dig> cultivar.

protein disulfide isomerases  are involved in the formation of inter- or intramolecular disulphide bonds and in the assembly of glutenin macropolymer  through intramolecular disulphide bonds among wheat grain proteins
 <cit> . thus, they play important roles in the maturation of secreted plasma membrane and storage proteins
 <cit> . investigations of rice mutant esp <dig> indicated that ospdil1- <dig> retains proglutelin to prevent heterotypic interactions with prolamine polypeptides within the er lumen
 <cit> . peak expression of gmpdil-3a and gmpdil-3b during seed maturation suggested that they might be involved in folding or accumulation of storage proteins
 <cit> . in wheat, nine pdi and pdil genes were cloned, and their transcriptional levels in endosperm cellularization demonstrated that they were associated with storage protein synthesis and deposition, which is highly related to gluten quality
 <cit> . in this study, itraq-based analysis revealed that two pdi proteins  were highly expressed at the early grain development stage  , which could facilitate the folding and maturation of storage proteins and promote gluten quality conformation.

storage proteins included glutenins and gliadins as well as hmw albumins and globulins and avenin-like proteins, which have important impacts on grain nutrition and processing quality. glutenins, which consist of high- and low-molecular weight glutenin subunits , are conserved storage proteins that are synthesized on polyribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum 
 <cit> . disulfide bond conformation, folding, and maturation of glutenin proteins are assisted by er lumenal proteins such as molecular chaperone proteins pdis, binding proteins , and glutamine synthetases
 <cit> . in the current work, five hmw-gs  in the yanyou  <dig> cultivar were detected by sds-page , and this combination of hmw-gs is considered to yield the best dough quality
 <cit> . all five subunits, which had fast accumulation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and whose peak expression occurred at  <dig> dpa, were identified by itraq approach . several studies demonstrated higher glutenin accumulation rate at the early stage of grain development, which contributed to good quality
 <cit> . however, the expression levels of other storage proteins such as two lmw-gs , five avenin-like proteins , and three gliadin/avenin-like proteins  only slightly changed until  <dig> dpa, but they were dramatically up-regulated at  <dig> dpa.

in addition, grain hardness in wheat is also important for end-product quality. soft wheats are generally used to make cookies and pastries, while hard wheats are typically used to make breads
 <cit> . grain softness protein  and puroindoline are two important proteins controlling wheat flour hardness
 <cit> . this study detected two up-regulated gsps and three up-regulated puroindolines, the expression levels of which gsp  and puroindoline b  had  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold changes, respectively , while the others had about 3-fold changes. their high expression could contribute to the conformation of grain hardness and superior bread quality of the yanyou  <dig> cultivar.

the expression of defense/stress proteins in developing grains
to protect themselves against various biotic or abiotic stresses such as osmotic stress, drought, salts, extreme temperatures, and pathogenic microorganisms, a number of stress/defense proteins are expressed throughout wheat grain development. previous studies indicated that 22%
 <cit>  and  <dig> %
 <cit>  of grain albumins and globulins belonged to the stress/defense category. our itraq analysis revealed  <dig>  stress/defense deps during the grain development of the yanyou  <dig> cultivar, and some of them showed more than 5-fold up-regulation at later stages, such as lea, αai, xi, and serpin . lea proteins accumulated at the late stage, especially under stress conditions such as drought and low temperature
 <cit> . a previous study showed that erd <dig>  an arabidopsis dehydrin , had calcium binding activity and it was regulated by phosphorylation, suggesting a role in calcium binding
 <cit> . calcium binding proteins may have a significant impact on signaling processes and regulate second messenger transmission
 <cit> . in this study, eight lea proteins involved in protecting seeds from serious dehydration at the late developmental stage were found to significantly increase their levels at  <dig> dpa . particularly, the two lea proteins q8gv <dig> and q8gv <dig> were phosphorylated at ser4/ser112/ser <dig> and at ser4/ser <dig>  respectively . early-methionine-labeled polypeptides  are members of the lea proteins and are considered to be embryo-specific
 <cit> . three emps  were found to be dramatically up-regulated at  <dig> dpa, and two  were phosphorylated at ser <dig> and ser <dig>  respectively. these phosphorylation modifications may enhance the defense capability to various adverse stresses during grain development.

the serpin family functions through irreversible inhibition of endogenous and exogenous proteinases, which play important roles in plant growth, development, stress responses, and defense against insects and pathogens
 <cit> . serpins, which are found in wheat grain up to several percent of total protein, are probably laid down in seeds as a defensive shield to protect storage proteins from digestion
 <cit> . previous research demonstrated that serpin was significantly expressed under osmotic conditions such as salt and cold stresses
 <cit> . in our study, the expression levels of five serpins  were dramatically increased at  <dig> dpa, and the level of c0lf <dig> increased by  <dig> -fold . furthermore, four serpins  were found to be phosphorylated  and all had one phosphorylated site at thr <dig> in the n-terminus . recent studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of tyrosine in maspins, which belong to the serpin family, plays a role in increasing maspin expression and accumulation in the cytoplasm
 <cit> . the phosphorylation at thr <dig> at the c-terminal 26-residue peptide can significantly increase the activity of serpin a1
 <cit> . thus, phosphorylation modifications could increase the activity of serpins, then promote the formation of serpin-protease complex, and protect storage proteins from digestion.

the hsp family has two essential atp-binding sites and belongs to a larger class of aaa+ chaperone-like atpases, which are involved in the assembly, operation, or disassembly of protein complexes
 <cit> . thus, hsps play an important role in a diverse array of cellular processes such as amino acid and protein metabolism, stress response, and signal transduction
 <cit> . some members of the hsp/chaperone family, such as hsp <dig> , hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  can stabilize protein conformation, prevent aggregation, and thereby maintain the non-native protein in a competent state for subsequent refolding by other hsps/chaperones such as hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp90
 <cit> . five hsps were detected with different expression patterns during grain development, among which hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>   were gradually up-regulated, hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  were sharply up-regulated to  <dig> dpa and then dramatically down-regulated, and hsp <dig>  was sharply down-regulated at  <dig> dpa . this suggests that different classes of hsps may be involved in different functions through various expression patterns. particularly, hsp <dig>  was phosphorylated at four phosphorylation sites , and the phosphorylated peptide _eisddedee_ was also identified in arabidopsis <cit>  and rice
 <cit> , indicating the revolutionary conservation at this serine phosphorylation site in different plant species. cooperation with different classes of hsps under abiotic stress is essential in cellular protective functions such as maintaining proteins conformations, preventing aggregation of non-native proteins, refolding of denatured proteins, and removing harmful polypeptides
 <cit> . phosphorylation at the n-terminal domain of hsp <dig> influenced client protein maturation and co-chaperone binding
 <cit> . protein-protein interaction analysis showed that hsp <dig>  interacted with other  <dig> deps identified by itraq, including hsp <dig>  and the defense protein xi  . the phosphorylation of hsp <dig> may enhance the interactions with other deps and promote its defense functions.

exposure of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses can induce the production of ros, including superoxide radicals , alkyl-hydroperoxide , and hydrogen peroxide . to protect themselves against these toxic oxygen intermediates, plants employ defense systems, in which some defense proteins such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, thioredoxin, and peroxiredoxin catalyze the scavenging of ros. catalase is involved in the elimination of h2o <dig> <cit> , peroxidase and peroxiredoxin reduce the levels of h2o <dig>  alkyl-hydroperoxides, and oh- <cit> . thioredoxin is involved in cellular protection against oxidative stress, particularly during seed desiccation
 <cit> . 1-cys-peroxiredoxin has peroxidase activity when coupled to the thioredoxin system
 <cit>  and it can be activated by glutathione transferase 
 <cit> . in the present study, nine deps involved in ros scavenging system were identified, of which five were gradually up-regulated during grain development, including catalase , peroxidase , peroxiredoxin , 1-cys-peroxiredoxin , and gt . particularly, peroxidase was up-regulated by  <dig> -fold at  <dig> dpa. two catalases  were down-regulated, while thioredoxin  and gt  showed down-up expression pattern. different expression patterns may reflect different functions in response to different stress conditions at different grain developmental stages. interestingly, thioredoxin expression was sharply increased by  <dig> -fold at  <dig> dpa , suggesting its role in the scavenging of toxic oxygen produced by dehydration at late grain developmental stages
 <cit> .

based on our results, an overview of deps involved in stress/defense could be drawn , which depicts a coordinated adverse response and defense mechanism during grain development. since the grain development is liable to affected by adverse environments such as various biotic and abiotic stresses, various defense proteins were recruited to resist and adapt to the adverse environments. considerable deps involved in defense/stress processes were activated and significantly up-regulated during grain development. moreover, some deps such as lea, serpins, hsp <dig>  and wail <dig> were phosphorylated, which could enhance the activity of stress/defense-related proteins and their interactions with other proteins. the coordinated functions of these stress/defense-related proteins could protect grain development from adverse harm, and benefit wheat yield and quality.figure  <dig> 
an overlook of stress/defense related proteins and ros scavenging system involved in wheat grain development. lea, tlp, slp, cap, crp emp and wail <dig> have coordinating role in various osmotic stresses during grain development. αai and xi are mainly involved in protection of starch and cell wall, respectively. purothionin, antifungal protein r , chltinase, rrna n-glycosidase  and wheatwin <dig> were mainly involved in resistance to pathogen and pest infection. serpin, cti and hsps are involved in protein protection processes, serpin and cti prevent protein from degradation by protese, hsps prevent degraded protein from aggregation and help misfolded protein refolding, these processes also involved in resistance to pathogen/insect and osmotic stress. all defense process can produce reactive oxygen and which can be scavenged by ros scavenging system. the protein levels are shown in coloured squares, indicating the change of expression for each developmental stage. the phosphorylated deps are marked.



CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that the itraq-based quantitative proteome analysis is a powerful technique for investigating the deps involved in wheat grain development, especially for low-abundance proteins. overall,  <dig> deps and their quantitative expression characterization during the grain development of the yanyou  <dig> cultivar were studied, which revealed the central metabolism changes involved in wheat grain development. considerable deps involved in starch and protein biosynthesis pathways and stress/defense mechanisms displayed significant up-regulated expression, consistent with grain size increase and reserve accumulation during grain development. some deps such as agpase, susy, hsp <dig>  and serpins were phosphorylated at different sites, suggesting their important roles in wheat grain development. our results have provided comprehensive proteome insights into the wheat grain development and increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing wheat yield and quality.
