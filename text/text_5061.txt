BACKGROUND
stem cell therapy is a facet of regenerative medicine that aims to ameliorate the damage caused to the brain by the grafting of healthy "reparative" cells. pioneering studies implanting mouse neural stem cells  into the brains of stroke animals have demonstrated significant recovery in motor and cognitive tests  <cit> . these findings provide a rational approach to the development of a cell based therapy for ischemic stroke. a substantial and consistent supply of allogeneic nscs is required in order to treat a large patient population. unfortunately, human nscs are somatic stem cells and susceptible to genetic and phenotypic changes and loss of biological activity following extensive tissue culture expansion  <cit> .

immortalization of nscs overcomes their restricted expansion potential. the myc proto-oncogene has proven a successful tool for immortalization of nscs  <cit> . in these research applications, both v- and c-myc promote consistent and enhanced tissue culture expansion of human nscs while maintaining a stable karyotype and retaining biological activity. the c-mycertam technology has proven to be as successful in generating immortalized neural stem cell lines as c-myc alone  <cit> . the c-mycertam transgene is better suited as an immortalizing agent for clinical applications because c-myc protein function is conditional on the presence of the tamoxifen metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen . the translated c-mycertam recombinant protein is a conjugation of human c-myc and modified mouse estradiol receptor  and is present as an inactive monomer in the cytosol of the cell. when added to the tissue culture medium, 4-oht specifically binds to the er moiety causing the c-mycertam protein to dimerize and subsequently translocate to the cell nucleus where c-myc is active as a transcription factor  <cit> .

ctx0e <dig> is a human nsc line that was derived using c-mycertam technology and showed recovery in sensorimotor deficits following grafting in mcao rodent brain  <cit> . one copy of the c-mycertam transgene is integrated into the ctx0e <dig> cell genome  under the cytomegalovirus  immediate early promoter  <cit> . we have shown that the c-mycertam transgene is expressed in proliferating ctx0e <dig> cell cultures in vitro; however, the expression of this transgene following the grafting of ctx0e <dig> cells in vivo was not characterized. although neoplasm formation has never been observed with ctx0e <dig> cells in multiple pre-clinical studies, this information would nonetheless be important in assessing the inherent risk of using a genetically modified cell line for clinical applications.

analysis of transgene expression following implantation of genetically modified cells is challenging because of the relatively small proportion of implanted cells compared to the host. using a fluorescent reporter transgene, the cmv promoter has been shown to undergo silencing in grafted hematopoietic cells in vivo  <cit> . in another example, lee et al. demonstrated by immunohistochemistry  that v-myc was silenced following intracerebral implantation of immortalized hbf <dig>  cells  <cit> . unfortunately, these methodologies were not appropriate for our application. the c-mycertam transgene in ctx0e <dig> cells does not contain a fluorescent reporter that could be monitored. with respect to ihc, we were concerned it would be inconclusive due to the unknown sensitivity and potential cross-reactivity of the antibodies. furthermore, ihc was ruled out since the analysis would be limited to a finite number of sections and would not encompass all cells present in the graft.

in this study, we developed a novel and sensitive method that is able to analyze absolute gene expression within human genetically modified cells grafted into rodent brain. this method used the human specific alu genomic sequence to detect and quantify ctx0e <dig> cells grafted within the rodent brain background  <cit> . absolute quantification of c-mycertam transcription made it possible to calculate the number of c-mycertam transcript copies per ctx0e <dig> cell. using this methodology, c-mycertam transgene silencing was shown following grafting of ctx0e <dig> cells into mcao rat brain. although not intentionally incorporated into the design technology of c-mycertam, silencing of the cmv transgene promoter in vivo demonstrates an additional safety feature of this technology and of the ctx0e <dig> cells.

RESULTS
alu and c-mycertam assay design
the analysis of the c-mycertam transcript expression per ctx0e <dig> cell, both in vivo and in vitro, was dependent upon the ability to sequentially purify genomic dna  and rna from the same biological sample using the all dna/rna kit . the gdna preparation yielded one single band by agarose gel electrophoresis with no evidence of degradation or contaminating rna . the rna preparation yielded the expected 28s and 18s bands, again with no degradation or dna contamination visible . standard curves were then generated to determine: 1) the number of ctx0e <dig> cells present in a gdna sample by alu qpcr ; and 2) the number of c-mycertam transcripts present in a retro-transcribed rna reaction sample . the alu sequence assay could reproducibly detect human ctx0e <dig> gdna with as few as one ctx0e <dig> cell per reaction; whereas, the c-mycertam assay could detect as few as  <dig> copies per reaction.

validation of alu and c-mycertam assays
the alu sequence and c-mycertam transcription assays were developed in the presence of rat brain gdna or cdna, as described in the methods. these experiments involved mixing purified ctx0e <dig> dna/cdna with purified rat brain dna/cdna. however, in order to verify that ctx0e <dig> cells grafted in rat brain could be processed and analysed effectively together a positive control experiment was carried out. this experiment consisted of harvesting and processing the rat brain tissue immediately after a  <dig> μl injection of ctx0e <dig> cells was delivered. it was determined by counting using a haemocytometer that the cell suspension prior to delivery contained  <dig>  cells/μl – i.e. total of  <dig>  cells were present in  <dig> μl loaded into the syringe. by alu sequence analysis, the injected rat brain tissue sections contained an average of  <dig>   ctx0e <dig> cells . the measured number of ctx0e <dig> cells is within the range expected. analysis of the total rna isolated from these samples showed ctx0e <dig> cells to express on average  <dig>   c-mycertam transcript copies per cell . control ctx0e <dig> cells measured in culture were shown to have a similar value of  <dig>   c-mycertam transcript copies per cell.

ctx0e <dig> cell detection and quantification in vivo
four weeks after the mcao, a total of  <dig>  ctx0e <dig> cells were implanted bilaterally into the putamen. the rats were sacrificed 1-week or 4-weeks post-implantation, their brains were removed and sections encompassing the injection tracts were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. the alu and c-mycertam assays were then carried out on the gdna and cdna isolated from each tissue section, respectively. ctx0e <dig> cells were detected in all implanted animals at both time points, with a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  ctx0e <dig> cells detected per brain. the total number of ctx0e <dig> cells detected, per rat brain, is shown at 1-week  and 4-weeks  post-implantation. an aliquot of the ctx0e <dig> cell suspension prepared for implantation was retained and used to determine the pre-implantation c-mycertam transcript copy number. the average c-mycertam transcription level for the three ctx0e <dig> cell suspensions prepared in this study was found to be  <dig>   copies per cell . this is compared to the population of ctx0e <dig> cells detected in vivo, where the average number of c-mycertam transcript copies per ctx0e <dig> cell was calculated to be  <dig>   at 1-week and  <dig>   at 4-weeks . the number of ctx0e <dig> cells, the number c-mycertam transcripts calculated per tissue section and the resultant number of c-mycertam transcript copies per ctx0e <dig> cell, are shown in table  <dig>  c-mycertam transcripts were detected within approximately 50% of the tissue sections containing ctx0e <dig> cells at both time points. it is important to note, in no instance was a c-mycertam transcript signal detected where ctx0e <dig> cells were absent.

transgene methylation analysis
direct modification of the dna by methylation is an epigenetic mechanism to downregulate or silence gene expression. using bisulfite sequencing, the methylation status of the cmv transgene promoter was investigated in ctx0e <dig> cells pre- and post-implantation. the cmv promoter of the transgene contains numerous potential methylation sites within a cpg rich island . bisulfite sequencing of gdna clones taken from control non-implanted ctx0e <dig> cells showed only 2% of these cpg sites were methylated . however, the same analysis carried out on clones obtained from the ctx0e <dig> cell implanted mcao rat brain samples showed that  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the cpg islands were methylated at 1-week and 4-weeks, respectively . there was no statistical difference between 1- and 4-weeks, p =  <dig> , indicating that the methylation had occurred within the first week and was constant to the 4-week time point. collectively, only four gdna transgene promoter clones in vivo were found to be devoid of any methylated sites from a total of  <dig> analysed; in other words, ~96% of the transgene promoter sequences analysed in vivo where found to contain at least one methylated cpg island.

in vitro characterization
additional experiments were carried out in vitro to determine if a reduction in transgene transcription leads to a concomitant reduction in translated protein. analyses were carried out on control ctx0e <dig> cells and those cultured for 1- and 4-weeks in the absence of growth factors and 4-oht. in this non growth permissive condition, transgene transcription was found to decrease by  <dig> % at 1-week and  <dig> % at 4-weeks relative to control by qrt-pcr . analysis of c-mycertam protein was performed by colocalization of c-myc and erα antigen staining by immunocytochemistry . the c-myc and erα antigens were always found to colocalize in the nucleus of a proportion of ctx0e <dig> cells, indicating that the antibodies were detecting the c-mycertam target . immunoreactive cells were counted and expressed as a proportion of total cells. these data showed control ctx0e <dig> cell cultures were approximately  <dig> % positive for c-mycertam; whereas, following egf, bfgf and 4-oht withdrawal the number of ctx0e <dig> cells positive for c-mycertam were  <dig> % at 1-week and  <dig> % at 4-weeks . western blot analysis using the c-myc and erα antibodies demonstrated that total c-mycertam protein levels followed more closely the progressive drop observed by gene expression and were reduced by  <dig> % at 1-week and  <dig> % at 4-weeks following egf, bfgf, and 4-oht withdrawal .

discussion
the c-mycertam immortalization technology has been successfully utilized to derive a clonal human neural stem cell line from fetal cortical brain. this cell line, referred to as ctx0e <dig>  possess biological attributes which are desirable for clinical applications for stroke therapy. namely, this cell line can be continuously expanded in vitro, and following implantation in mcao rodent brain, results in sensorimotor recovery in the absence of cell treatment-related histopathology  <cit> . the in vitro effects of c-mycertam in the ctx0e <dig> cell line have been well characterized. here we investigated the expression of this transgene following implantation of ctx0e <dig> cells into mcao rat brain.

in this paper we report a novel method to examine absolute gene expression within human cells implanted into rodent brain. in this example, we analyzed the number of c-mycertam transcript copies per ctx0e <dig> cell both in vitro and in vivo. the calculated c-mycertam copies per ctx0e <dig> cell prepared directly from fresh culture , cell suspension prior to implantation  or immediately following implantation  had comparable values. this validated that the assays employed were ctx0e <dig> cell specific and the rodent brain background did not cause any interference. using these established assays, c-mycertam transgene transcription was analyzed in the surviving ctx0e <dig> cell population at 1- and 4-weeks post-implantation in mcao rodent brain. at both time points there was a substantial reduction in the calculated number of c-mycertam transcript copies per ctx0e <dig> cell detected.

this molecular biological approach provided many advantages over immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques. the results obtained by rt-pcr and pcr were quantitative. immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization techniques do not permit the quantitative assessment of c-mycertam levels within a given cell. in addition, the sensitivity of molecular biological techniques were defined, as a single ctx0e <dig> cell and ten copies of c-mycertam per reaction, respectively; whereas, this level of sensitivity would have been difficult, if not impossible, to achieve by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization techniques. our in vivo samples were processed rapidly, immediately after harvesting, thus capturing the most accurate data. furthermore, from a practical perspective this molecular biological approach analyzed all ctx0e <dig> cells present in the rodent brain, whereas, histological preparation methods would require a large number of sections to analyze all cells present. although the average transgene expression significantly decreased in vivo, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression observed may have arisen from a limited number of ctx0e <dig> cells. however, the silencing of c-mycertam expression observed in vivo is consistent with the absence of tumor formation derived from ctx0e <dig> cells when implanted in vivo  <cit> .

transgene silencing can occur at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. long-term transcriptional silencing of retrovirus-delivered genes has been shown largely to result from methylation of the cytosine nucleotides within the promoter regions  <cit> . the factors responsible for dna methylation is reviewed in detail elsewhere  <cit> . as the c-mycertam transgene was delivered into the ctx0e <dig> cell line using a retrovirus, it was reasonable to speculate that transgene silencing had occurred through methylation of cpg islands within the transgene promoter region. bisulfite dna sequencing was used to determine the methylation status of the cmv promoter region of the c-mycertam transgene within ctx0e <dig> cells. in culture, only  <dig> of the total cpg sites screened were found to be methylated. in the samples prepared from ctx0e <dig> grafted mcao rodent brain  <dig> to 100% of the sites were methylated. these data unequivocally show that c-mycertam expression is silenced at a transcriptional level in vivo as a result of dna methylation within the cmv transgene promoter region.

the c-mycertam technology acts at a protein rather than a transgene expression level. to mitigate the risk of the technology following intracerebral implantation of ctx0e <dig> cells it was important to investigate if c-mycertam transcription level was a predictive measure of the recombinant protein level. western blot analysis of the in vivo samples proved impossible because the c-mycertam protein would be too dilute to detect in whole brain extracts. in addition, ihc analysis of the in vivo samples was impractical because of the substantial number of sections required to perform a global analysis of c-mycertam protein expression. to overcome these challenges we developed and in vitro model of c-mycertam silencing in ctx0e <dig> cells. the kinetics of transgene silencing in vitro was slower than that observed in vivo, which provided the ideal cell culture model to directly compare the progressive decline in c-mycertam transcription with the translated protein level. although we observed a decrease in the number of c-mycertam positive cells by icc, the relative percentage of positive cells did not closely follow relative transgene expression levels. these icc findings further highlight the drawback of histological approaches because the cells were scored positive independent of the quantity of c-mycertam protein present within the cell. on the other hand, when total c-mycertam protein levels were measured by western blot they were found to decrease in parallel with transgene transcript level over the 1- to 4-week period. this data indicates that the c-mycertam transcript and protein levels are closely linked in ctx0e <dig> cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that c-mycertam transgene expression levels in ctx0e <dig> cells were significantly reduced in vitro, upon growth factor and 4-oht withdrawal, and in vivo following implantation. we demonstrated that in vivo transgene silencing occurred through dna methylation. in addition, the in vitro results showed that c-mycertam transcription level was representative of the c-mycertam protein level. the data demonstrate that uncontrolled in vivo cell growth arising from c-mycertam technology is unlikely based on both the silencing of the c-mycertam gene expression reported here and the specific requirement for the 4-oht ligand to activate the c-mycertam protein. furthermore, these data demonstrate that the retroviral insertion of stable transgene constructs into human neural stem cells with the cmv promoter element is not an inherently unsafe procedure for the production of cellular therapies.
