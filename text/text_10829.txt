BACKGROUND
retinoid-inducible gene  <dig>   <cit> , which encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids also known as tazarotene-induced gene  <dig>   <cit>  or retinoic-acid receptor responder  <dig>   <cit> , belongs to the hrev <dig> gene family that contains five members in humans  <cit> . proteins of the hrev <dig> family share four conserved domains, a proline-rich motif located at the n-terminus, followed by a conserved h-box, the nc domain and a c-terminal transmembrane domain  <cit> . the hrev <dig> family proteins are growth regulators, and have recently been classified into the nc protein family along with the lecithin:retinol acyltransferase , protein 2a from avian encephalomyelitis virus and echovirus  <dig> and a hypothetical protein at5g <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . hrev <dig> family proteins are typically localized within the endomembranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum  and golgi apparatus  <cit> . however, nuclear localization has been reported for the hrev <dig> proteins  <cit> .

rig <dig> exhibits growth suppressive and proapoptotic activities in normal keratinocytes  <cit>  and cancer cells of various origins  <cit> . the proapoptotic activities of rig <dig> are mediated through caspase-dependent  <cit>  or -independent pathways  <cit> , and are initiated only by the golgi-, but not the er-targeted rig <dig>  <cit> . in addition, rig <dig> stimulates cellular differentiation of keratinocytes, which is mediated by the activation of type i tissue transglutaminase  <cit> . also, rig <dig> inhibits the signaling pathways of ras and phosphoinositide- <dig> kinase /serine/threonine-specific protein kinase   <cit> .

the structure/function relationship of rig <dig> has been investigated. presence of the c-terminal transmembrane domain, ranging from  <dig> to <dig> amino acids, that targets the protein to endomembranes is essential for rig1-mediated activities  <cit> . the rig <dig> segment spanning amino acids 124– <dig> interacts with and serves as the substrate of tissue transglutaminase i  <cit> . also, the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid region is required for rig1-dependent keratinocyte differentiation, and removal of the region converts rig <dig> into a proapoptotic protein in human keratinocytes. within the nc domain, the asp112-cys <dig>  motif of rig <dig> is the most conserved feature throughout evolution from virus to homo sapiens  <cit> , and the cys <dig> of lrat, corresponding to the cys <dig> of the rig <dig>  is proposed to participate in a catalytic triad that is directly involved in the lrat-catalyzed esterification  <cit> . recently, dodecapeptides  h-tig-3111– <dig> and h-ha-rev107-1111– <dig>  based on  <dig> conserved amino acids surrounding the nc motif within the nc domain of rig <dig> and hrev <dig>  have been shown to induce apoptosis of melanoma cells, and the leu <dig> has been shown to be indispensable for this activity  <cit> . the h-tig-3111– <dig>  which is referred to as rig1111– <dig> hereafter, is targeted to the nucleus where it binds and activates promoters of transcription factors involved in the g <dig> → s transition. the nuclear localization and dna binding activities of rig1111– <dig> sharply contrasts with the character of wild type rig <dig> that is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and binds to ras  <cit>  and transglutaminase  <cit> . the function of the proline-rich region and h-box of rig <dig> has not been investigated, although the proline-rich region of hrev <dig> has recently been shown to bind pr65α, a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2a, and to inhibit the enzyme's activity  <cit> .

this study investigated functional regions and critical amino acids that are essential for the proapoptotic activities of rig <dig> in htta cervical cancer cells. both full-length rig <dig> and various truncated variants were constructed with an enhanced green fluorescence protein  tag to the n-terminus of the protein. because rig1111– <dig> also functions as an anti-proliferative peptide  <cit> , and to further evaluate critical amino acids responsible for rig1111–123- and rig1-mediated activities, wild type and mutated  dps as well as the full length rig <dig> containing various mutations tagged to the c-terminal of egfp were constructed. the nc motif was selected due to its evolutionary conservation from virus to mammalian  <cit> . leu <dig> is shown to play a critical role in the rig1111–123-mediated activities in e:wm- <dig> melanoma cells, and arg <dig> may play a role involving dna contacts  <cit> . therefore, leu <dig> and arg <dig> were selected for the analysis. the results demonstrate that the nc motif of rig <dig> is important for rig1-mediated cell death. in addition, the nc motif, but not leu <dig> is essential for rig1111–123-mediated induction of cell death of htta cells.

RESULTS
the nc domain is important for rig <dig> in the induction of cell death and apoptosis
to identify functional domains of rig <dig> which are related to induction of cell death or apoptosis, we first constructed expression vectors that synthesized recombinant proteins containing egfp tagged to the n-terminus of the wild type rig <dig> or various truncated rig <dig> variants, with the exception of rig1Δc in which egfp was tagged to the c-terminus of the rig <dig> . the rig1Δn <dig>  rig1Δn <dig>  rig1Δn <dig> and rig1Δn40– <dig> variant proteins all contained the membrane spanning domain but differed in the h-box and nc domains. the c-terminal deleted rig1Δn <dig>  rig1/nc and rig1Δc proteins vary in the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids including the h-box. expression of egfp-tagged rig <dig> variants at the expected molecular weight was demonstrated in transfected cytosols prepared from htta cervical cancer cells . the egfp-tagged wild type and n-terminal truncated  rig <dig> recombinant proteins were expressed at much lower levels compared to that of variants without c-terminal hydrophobic domain. similar results were also observed in previous studies  <cit> . with the exception of rig1Δn <dig> and rig1Δn <dig>  which had mainly nuclear localization with weak and diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, all the egfp-tagged recombinant proteins that contained the c-terminal hydrophobic domain and the n-terminal region between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids  were primarily distributed in the perinuclear region , and were partially co-localized to the golgi apparatus . the c-terminal truncated rig <dig> with egfp tagged to either the c-  or n-terminus  <cit>  were diffusely expressed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. variants  that had truncation at both the n- and c-termini exhibited similar expression patterns as the rig1Δc-egfp with the exception of perinuclear localization of the fusion proteins also detected in less than 5% of cells.

cell death and viability, determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase  and by the mtt assay respectively, were then analyzed in htta cells transiently transfected with various deleted egfp-rig <dig> expression vectors. with the exception of rig1Δc-egfp that had no effect on cell death and cell viability, wild type and the other egfp-rig <dig> deletion variants significantly increased cell death by 29%–115% and reduced cell viability by 22–39% after transient expression for  <dig> h , and the egfp-rig1Δ40– <dig>  which lacks the nc domain, had the weakest effect on both cell death and cell viability among the rig <dig> fusion proteins tested. in contrast, the egfp-tagged rig <dig> variant that contained only the nc domain  significantly increased cell death by 82% and reduced cell viability by 36%. similar effects of wild type and truncated rig <dig> variants on cell growth were also observed in htta cervical cancer cells expressing the monomer red fluorescence protein -tagged recombinant rig <dig> variants , indicating the effects on cell growth was mediated by rig <dig> fragment within the recombinant protein. the effects of egfp-tagged recombinant rig <dig> variants on cell death were further explored by the analysis of chromatin condensation in htta cells  <dig> h after transfection. chromatin condensation was readily detected in most cells expressing the egfp-tagged wild type or truncated rig <dig> with the exception of rig1Δc-egfp and egfp-rig1Δ40– <dig> . these results suggest that the nc domain plays the major role in the growth inhibition and proapoptotic activities of rig <dig> 

whether induction of cellular apoptotosis by rig <dig> variants in htta cells was related to caspase  <dig> activation was then analyzed in cytosol extracts prepared  <dig> h after transfection. caspase  <dig> activities in cytosol extracts prepared from egfp-tagged recombinant rig <dig> variants that contained the c-terminal hydrophobic domain  were significantly enhanced ranging from  <dig> to 227% of control levels . however, rigiΔc-egfp, egfp-rig1Δ40– <dig>  egfp-rig1Δn <dig> and egfp-rig1/nc did not activate caspase  <dig> in htta cells.

the nc motif plays a critical role in dp-induced cell death and apoptosis
a multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of the nc domain among the hrev <dig> family proteins and lrat is shown in fig 3a. thirteen amino acids within the nc domain are identical among all  <dig> members, and the dp region exhibits the highest degree of homology. fluorescein -labeled wild type and mutated rig1111– <dig> peptides  were introduced into htta cells to analyze activities and critical amino acids of dp affecting cell death. the wild type fitc-rig1111– <dig> was predominantly distributed within the nucleus of htta cells  <dig> h after electroporation . the leu120-mutated fitc-rig1111–123:l → c was distributed homogenously between cytoplasm and nucleus. in contrast, dps containing mutation at one , two  or three  amino acids were all cytoplasmically localized. similar nuclear and cytoplasm distribution of wild type and ncr-mutated rig1111– <dig> respectively was observed in a <dig> melanoma cells. however, both the wild type and ncr-mutated rig1-dps were distributed only within the cytoplasm of normal human fibroblasts . in addition to nuclear targeting, rig1111– <dig> also induced nuclear shrinkage, a characteristic of cellular apoptosis, of a <dig> cells.

analysis of fitc-dps effect on cell death showed that wild type fitc-rig1111– <dig> significantly increased cell death by 67% and decreased cell viability by 34%  <dig> h after peptide introduction in htta cells, and the effects were also significantly evident  <dig> h after peptide introduction . similarly, the leu <dig> or arg <dig> mutated fitc-dps both significantly increased cell death by 64–89% and decreased cell viability by 29–37%  <dig> h after peptide introduction. fitc-dps that contained two  or three  amino acid mutations had no effect on cell death and cell viability. unrelated peptide   <cit>  was also tested for the activity on cell death and cell viability  <dig> and/or  <dig> h after peptide introduction, and no effect was observed . similar effects on cell death and viability mediated by the wild type but not ncr-mutated fitc-rig1111– <dig> were observed in a <dig> melanoma cells but not in normal human fibroblasts . activities of fitc-dps on chromatin condensation were also analyzed in htta cells. chromatin condensation was observed only in cells electroporated with wild type, leu120-mutated or arg121-mutated fitc-dps, but not in cells with nc- or ncr-mutated fitc-dps . similarly, fusion protein containing rig1111– <dig> tagged to the c-terminus of egfp   induced cellular chromatin condensation, and significantly induced cell death of htta cells as determined by mtt and ldh assay , and the rig1111–123-mediated cell death and apoptosis is reversed by mutation at the nc motif, but not at leu <dig> or arg <dig> within the egfp-tagged dp. finally, cytosol extracts prepared from htta cells electroporated with fitc-conjugated dps for  <dig> h were analyzed for caspase  <dig> activation, and no caspase  <dig> activation was detected in all cytosol extracts .

mutation at the nc motif reduces rig1-mediated cell death
to further characterize the significance of amino acids within the dp in rig1-mediated cell death and cell viability in htta cells, we constructed constitutive egfp-rig <dig> expression vectors that synthesized wild type rig <dig> or rig <dig> with single , double  or triple  amino acid substitution. proper expression of mutated egfp-rig <dig> fusion proteins in htta cells was confirmed by western blotting . expression of wild type egfp-rig <dig> for  <dig> or  <dig> h resulted in significant increase of cell death by  <dig> or 83%, respectively, and reduction of cell viability by  <dig> or 29%, respectively . expression of leu <dig> substituted egfp-rig <dig> for  <dig> or  <dig> h resulted in significant increase of cell death by  <dig> or 89%, respectively, and reduction of cell viability by  <dig> or 26%, respectively. mutation at leu <dig> did not reduce egfp-rig1-mediated cell death or cell viability. significant effects of the arg <dig> substituted egfp-rig <dig> on cell death and cell viability were observed both at  <dig> and  <dig> h after transfection, although the effect was weaker than that of egfp-rig <dig>  increase of cell death and decrease in cell viability in egfp-rig <dig> variant transfectants containing double  or triple  mutations were not evident until  <dig> h after transfection with maximal 37% increase of cell death and 17% reduction of cell viability. the effects of double or triple amino acid substitutes were significantly less than the effects induced by egfp-rig <dig>  indicating that the nc motif of rig <dig> is important for the effects of rig <dig> on cell death. similar to the results shown in the fig 5c, chromatin condensations as observed in cells expressing the egfp-rig <dig> were profoundly decreased in cells expressing double  or triple  mutated egfp-rig <dig> variants. leu <dig> and arg <dig> substitution had no effect on or had weakly reduced egfp-rig1-induced chromatin condensation of htta cells .

discussion
through expression of egfp-tagged rig <dig> variants, we have identified that the nc domain, especially the nc motif, plays the most profound role in the rig1-mediated growth inhibition and cellular apoptosis of htta cells. the conclusion is supported first by significantly decreased the effect of rig <dig> on cell death of the fusion protein  with deletion at the nc domain, and fusion proteins that contain only the nc domain  exhibit profound proapoptotic activity. in addition, we demonstrated that the rig1111– <dig> within the nc domain increases cell death of htta cells, and that mutation of the nc motif results in complete abolishment of this activity. the importance of the nc motif is further demonstrated by the significant decrease of cell death in cells expressing the recombinant rig <dig> variants that have two  or three  amino acid mutations. significance of the nc motif in rig <dig> function is supported by the evolutionary conservation of the motif  <cit> . although a decrease of rig <dig> expression was frequently observed in several types of cancer tissues  <cit> , no mutation at the nc motif of rig <dig> has been reported.

analysis of the structure/function relationship of the nc motif and adjacent amino acids has been very limited. mondal and coworkers first demonstrated that both cysteine residues within the dp of lrat   are important for its enzymatic activity, and that the cysteine in the nc motif is the critical active-site involved in catalysis  <cit> . consistent with previous observations that demonstrate proapoptotic activities of dps derived from hrev <dig> and rig <dig> in melanoma cells   <cit> , we show that rig1111– <dig> induces cell death when introduced into htta cervical cancer cells as either a fitc-conjugated peptide or an egfp fusion protein. in contrast to the significant role of leu <dig> in rig1111–123-mediated growth inhibition of e:wm- <dig> melanoma cells  <cit> , this study demonstrated that the nc motif is indispensable, the arg <dig> residue plays a minor role and the leu <dig> has no effect on the anti-proliferative activities of rig1111– <dig> in htta cells. this conclusion is supported first by fg for nc substitution which resulted in complete or significantly loss of anti-proliferative activities of fitc-rig1111– <dig> or egfp-rig1111– <dig> respectively, second by profound loss of anti-proliferative activities in nc or ncr mutated rig <dig> fusion proteins, third by reduced proapoptotic activities of the arg121mutated rig1111– <dig> and rig <dig>  and fourth by the lack of effect of leu <dig> mutation on proapoptotic activities induced by rig1111– <dig> or rig <dig>  in addition to htta cervical cancer cells, results from this and previous  <cit>  studies also show growth suppressive activities of rig1111– <dig> on established or primary culture of melanoma cells but not normal human fibroblasts and proliferating melanocytes. therefore, rig1111– <dig> is selectively toxic to tumor cells, and the significance of leu <dig> in the rig1111–123-mediated growth suppression shown previously in melanoma cells is tumor cell type specific.

rig1111– <dig> is predicted to have an alpha helical structure  <cit> , and selectively binds to cis-binding elements and activates transcription factors involved in the g1/g <dig> → s transition in melanoma cells  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that rig1111– <dig> is targeted to nuclei of sensitive htta and a <dig> cells, and mutations that render the loss of growth inhibitory activities result in cytoplasmic distribution of the dps. also, rig1111– <dig> that has no effect on normal fibroblasts is distributed only within the cytoplasm. the tight association between nuclear localization and growth suppressive activities of rig1111– <dig> supports the notion that rig1111–123-mediated cell death in sensitive tumor cells is likely to be mediated through sequence-specific dna binding that leads to alteration in gene expression involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis. absence of nuclear localization of rig1111– <dig> in resistant melanoma cells  <cit>  and normal human fibroblasts may be related to failure in nuclear trafficking or to retention of the peptide. the α-helical structure of rig1111– <dig> within the egfp-rig1111– <dig> fusion protein is mostly maintained predicted using sspro and psipredview programs. this supports the growth suppressive activity of egfp-rig1111– <dig>  in contrast to complete loss of activities in nc- or ncr-mutated dps, growth suppressive activities of the nc- or ncr-mutated egfp-dp fusion proteins were significantly, but not completely, reduced. the increase in nuclear localization of the double and triple mutated egfp-dps, as compare to that of fitc-conjugated dps, may be related to partial growth suppressive activities of the mutated egfp-dps. currently, critical amino acids involving the binding of rig1111– <dig> to cis transcription elements have not been addressed, although rig1111– <dig> has been shown to bind cis binding elements for receptors of retinoic acids  <cit> . the fact that nuclear distribution of rig1111– <dig> was completely disrupted by mutations at the nc motif or arg <dig>  and was only partially altered by leu <dig> mutation suggests that the nc motif and arg <dig> play a profound role and leu <dig> a minor role in the binding of rig1111– <dig> to cis-elements. in addition to the four amino acids investigated in this study, six amino acids  within rig1111– <dig> are conserved across the hrev <dig> protein family and lrat . further analysis using site-directed dp mutants will be useful in dissecting the role of the nc motif, arg <dig>  leu <dig> and other six conserved amino acids in the dna binding properties as well as regulation of promoter and growth suppressive activities of rig1111– <dig> 

rig1Δn <dig> and rig1Δc are different only by  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus, which consist of the proline-rich region. rig1Δn <dig> that is devoid of the proline-rich region inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of htta cells. however, rig1Δc fails to have effect on cell growth, apoptosis and activation of ras and tissue transglutaminase i when the truncated protein is expressed as fusion proteins that have myc or egfp tagged to the n- or c-terminus  <cit> . these results suggest that the n-terminal proline-rich region of rig <dig> may bind effectors that prevent rig1Δc from exerting effects on the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. truncation of the n-terminal region, as demonstrated in rig1Δn <dig>  restores these activities. in fact, the proline-rich region of hrev <dig> has recently been shown to bind a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2a, pr65α. the binding leads to inhibiting the enzyme's activity and is important for proapoptotic activities of hrev <dig> on ovarian cancer cells  <cit> . identification of a binding protein for the proline-rich region of rig <dig> will be important to delineate the functional domain at the extreme n-terminus of rig <dig> 

most results from previous studies demonstrate perinuclear and endomembrane localization of transfected wild type rig <dig>  hrev <dig> and hrasls, which induce cellular apoptosis and/or differentiation of normal and cancer cells  <cit> . however, nuclear localization of hrev <dig> and rig <dig> was also observed in fibroblasts and cancer cells, and cytoplasmic but not nuclear targeted hrev <dig> is related to growth stimulation and poor patient survival of non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . therefore, proteins of this gene family may localize to multiple intracellular compartments where they have distinct activities. previous studies in htta cells and keratinocytes have demonstrated that rig1-induced apoptosis or differentiation-related apoptosis is mediated through golgi apparatus or mitochondria via caspase 3-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms  <cit> . similarly, caspase 3-mediated apoptosis is reported in keratinocytes expressing rig <dig> with  <dig> amino acids truncated at the n-terminus  <cit> . results of this study in htta cells also demonstrated activation of caspase  <dig> during apoptosis induced by variants  that contain the c-terminal hydrophobic domain but not rig1Δn <dig> and rig1/nc that are deleted at both n- and c-termini. although caspase  <dig> activation was observed in rig1Δn <dig>  rig1Δn <dig> and rig1Δn <dig>  rig1Δn <dig> and rig1Δn <dig> are mainly distributed in the nucleus whereas rig1Δn <dig> is in the perinuclear region. therefore, presence of c-terminal hydrophobic domain rather than subcellular localization appears to play an important role in the caspase  <dig> activation during apoptosis induced by n-terminal truncated rig <dig> variants. the nuclear targeted rig1111– <dig> that exhibits dna binding and proapoptotic activities was first demonstrated by simmons et al.  <cit> . this study further demonstrated that proapoptotic activities of truncated rig <dig> variants, rig1Δn <dig> and rig1/nc, and the nuclear targeted rig1111– <dig> are mediated through the caspase 3-independent mechanism in cervical cancer cells. rig1Δn <dig> and rig1/nc were found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. whether the mechanism of apoptosis induced by rig1Δn <dig> and rig1/nc is similar to that of rig1111– <dig> that is mediated through regulation of gene expression, as proposed by simmons et al  <cit> , needs further investigation.

wild type rig <dig> and n-terminal truncated variants such as rig1Δn <dig>  rig1Δn <dig> and rig1Δn <dig> were expressed at much lower levels than rig1Δn <dig> and rig1/nc that were truncated at both n- and c-termini. short protein half life  <cit>  or an increase in distribution to the particulate fraction due to n-terminal truncation  <cit>  may be responsible for the low protein levels observed in n-terminal truncated rig <dig> variants. although expressed at low levels, the extent of growth suppression on htta cells induced by n-terminal truncated variants was relatively similar to the rig1Δn <dig> and rig1/nc. similar potent proapoptotic activities, despite being expressed at extremely low levels, of rig <dig> variants with n-terminal truncation for  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids were also reported in keratinocytes  <cit> .

rig <dig> is a growth regulator that suppresses cell growth through induction of cellular differentiation and/or apoptosis. the differentiation-inducing activity of rig <dig> on keratinocytes is mediated through the activation of tissue transglutaminase i  <cit> . a structure/function analysis has demonstrated that the n-terminal region of rig <dig> is required for pro-differentiation activities, regardless, the c-terminal hydrophobic region by itself is enough for the activation of tissue transglutaminase i  <cit> . recently, results from our  <cit>  and others  <cit>  studies in htta cervical and ovarian cancer cells have demonstrated that rig <dig> inhibits expression and activation of signaling molecules such as her <dig>  ras, pi3k/akt and mtor that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and tumor invasion. further analysis using various truncated and mutated rig <dig> variants will be useful to dissect mechanisms as well as functional domains and critical motifs of rig <dig> in the regulation of signal pathways involving growth factor receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, rig <dig> variants exhibit growth inhibitory activity both when localized to the nucleus and when localized to the cytoplasm. the fact that caspase  <dig> activation was detected in n-terminal truncated variants, such as rig1Δn <dig>  rig1Δn <dig> and rigΔn <dig>  but not in c-terminal truncated variants supports the existence of multiple mechanisms during rig1-mediated growth inhibition. the nc domain, especially the nc motif, plays an important role in rig1-mediated apoptosis in htta cervical cancer cells. rig1111– <dig> alone exhibits profound proapoptotic activities and appears to be useful for development as an anticancer drug.
