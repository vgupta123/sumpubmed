BACKGROUND
gtp-binding proteins are found in all living organisms, and they play critical roles in fundamental processes such as cell proliferation, development, signal transduction and protein translation  <cit> . in general, these proteins are hydrolase enzymes that convert gtp into gdp, allowing transfer of the gtp terminal phosphate group to a target protein. as a consequence of this transfer, the highly conserved domains  of gtp-binding proteins undergo conformational changes that are detected by downstream effector proteins  <cit> , leading to specific outcomes.

comparison of bacterial genomes, across all taxa, has shown that at least eleven highly conserved gtp-binding proteins are present in prokaryotes  <cit> . among these, the obg/gtp <dig> subfamily of monomeric gtp binding proteins is of special significance, because these proteins exist not only in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes  <cit> . the gene encoding obg was first identified in bacillus subtilis  <cit> . obg orthologues were subsequently discovered in streptomyces griseus  <cit> , streptomyces coelicolor  <cit> , caulobacter crescentus  <cit> , echerichia coli  <cit>  and vibrio harveyi  <cit> . while orthologues of obg in c. crescentus and v. harveyi are known as cgta, the orthologue of obg in e. coli is called obge. bacterial obg display intrinsic gtpase activity and autophosphorylate with gtp, as does the eukaryotic signaling molecule ras, which is a gtp-binding protein. because of this, obg has been considered to be a potential bacterial signaling molecule  <cit> .

several published studies have attributed diverse functions to obg in different bacterial species. in b. subtilis, for example, obg is necessary for the transition from vegetative growth to stage  <dig> or stage ii of sporulation  <cit> . sporulation is a complex process in this species and is controlled by multiple components including phosphorelay. it appears that obg is one of the components that modulate the sporulation-related phosphorelay by an undefined mechanism  <cit> . in addition to its activity in b. subtilis, obg plays critical roles in developmental events in other bacteria, e.g. aerial mycelium formation and sporulation in streptomyces griseus  <cit>  and s. coelicolor  <cit> . in these two species, sporulation has a tight relationship with changes in the intracellular gtp-to-gdp ratio, and bacterial obgs are considered to be stress sensors for intracellular gtp-gdp changes reflecting energy balance in the cells. it has been proposed that high levels of obg-gtp maintain vegetative division of sporulating bacteria and prevent sporulation, while high levels of obg-gdp promote sporulation  <cit> .

obg is required for the activation of b. subtilis sigb in response to physical stress. this activation occurs via obg's physical interaction with upstream rsb regulators of sigb  <cit> . further, the gtp-binding pocket of crystallized obg of b. subtilis contains guanosine 5' diphosphate, 3' phosphate   <cit> . ppgpp is a guanosine nucleotide known as an alarmone in bacteria. alarmones are produced in response to amino acid starvation, and they act as signaling intermediates to slow cell growth or to initiate stress-induced differentiation pathways, including sporulation. in bacteria, the synthesis of ppgpp is performed by two enzymes, called rela and spot  <cit> . in e. coli, spot is one of the proteins known to interact with obg  <cit> . in v. cholerae, depletion of the obg homologue cgta results in a global gene expression pattern reflecting the low-nutrient stress reaction called the "stringent" response  <cit> . in v. cholerae, cgta interacts with spot, and this interaction decreases spot activity leading to the repression of the stringent response  <cit> . another interesting example of obg's association with stress comes from the pathogen legionella pneumophila, where its expression is elevated during intracellular survival  <cit> .

recent studies indicate that obg associates with ribosomes of bacteria and interacts with ribosomal proteins. in b. subtilis, obg coelutes with ribosomal proteins and interacts specifically with the ribosomal protein l <dig>  a component of the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . the obg orthologues of c. crescentus  <cit> , v. harveyi  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit>  also cofractionate with the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit. finally, bacterial obg has also been implicated in chromosomal partitioning  <cit>  and replication regulation  <cit> .

mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen and causative agent of tuberculosis in humans. the recent emergence of multidrug  and extremely drug resistant  m. tuberculosis strains now poses serious threats to people in the developing world  <cit> , and combating the disease requires the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. however, design and development of new drugs for tb largely depends upon the identification and characterization of novel drug targets in m. tuberculosis. the fact that obg is an essential protein for growth in bacteria, including m. tuberculosis  <cit> , and its association with ribosomes makes it a potential target for future antimicrobials  <cit> . thus, this study was undertaken to understand the basic properties of obg of m. tuberculosis.

RESULTS
overexpressed m. tuberculosis obg binds to, and hydrolyzes, gtp
a single copy of the gene coding for obg  is present in the genome of m. tuberculosis, between the genes prob  and rpma . the deduced amino acid sequence of the m. tuberculosis obg protein shows significant similarities with the obg proteins of b. subtilis, s. coelicolor and other bacterial species . to study the properties of obg of m. tuberculosis, the plasmid construct ptbobge was made to overexpress obg in e. coli. log phase e. coli cells  bearing the plasmid ptbobge were induced by iptg to overexpress a protein that migrates at around  <dig> kda in sds-page gels. this overexpressed protein, purified as detailed in the methods section, showed a single protein in sds-page . this was designated as his10-obg, to distinguish it from the native, normally expressed obg protein in m. tuberculosis.

to verify whether the overexpressed obg of m. tuberculosis can interact with gtp, we performed gtp-uv-crosslinking experiments  <cit> . the autoradiogram in figure 1b shows that his10-obg binds physically to -gtp. exposure of the reaction mixtures to uv irradiation for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min revealed that binding of gtp with his10-obg is increased between  <dig> and  <dig> min of exposure, but not after  <dig> min . when the reactions were performed in the presence of unlabeled gtp , crosslinking of his10-obg to gtp is inhibited, while addition of large amounts of unlabeled atp  have little effect on his10-obg binding with labeled gtp . this observation adds to existing evidence that m. tuberculosis obg has an inherent specificity for guanine nucleotides, as do the obg orthologues in c. crescentus  <cit> , b. subtilis  <cit>  and s. griseus  <cit> .

to determine whether the overexpressed obg can hydrolyze gtp, we incubated his <dig> -obg with radiolabeled gtp , and measured the release of phosphate  after  <dig> hours. figure 1c shows that his10-obg readily hydrolyzes gtp, and that this hydrolysis is inhibited by the addition of unlabeled gtp , indicating that unlabeled gtp competes with labeled gtp for the enzyme. addition of unlabeled atp  has no effect on the hydrolysis of labeled gtp , indicating that obg hydrolyzes specifically gtp. the effect of cold gtp in inhibiting the hydrolysis of radiolabeled gtp was not as pronounced as its effect in inhibition of gtp crosslinking . this is most likely due to the differences in the positions of the radiolabeled phosphates used in these two reactions. while the reaction mixture in the crosslinking experiment  had  <dig> μci  of  gtp, the reaction mixture in the hydrolysis experiment had  <dig> μci  of  gtp. in addition, the incubation times for these two experiments were different .

autophosphorylation of his10-obg
autophosphorylation by gtp is a defining characteristic of eukaryotic gtp-binding proteins, e.g. ras  <cit> , and of prokaryotic gtp-binding proteins, including era of e. coli  <cit>  and obg of b. subtilis . we therefore asked whether his10-obg of m. tuberculosis is autophosphorylated by gtp. figure 2a shows that purified his10-obg from m. tuberculosis is autophosphorylated by  gtp, in a time-dependent manner. this autophosphorylation is fully dependent upon mg2+ ions, since reactions conducted in the absence of mgcl <dig> in the buffer show almost zero phosphorylation activity . by contrast, no autophosphorylation of his10-obg occurs with  atp, even after  <dig> min of incubation. further, addition of unlabeled atp to the reaction mixture fails to produce any effect on his10-obg phosphorylation with  gtp . as expected, both unlabeled gtp and gdp significantly affect the phosphorylation of  gtp from his10-obg , indicating that both molecules serve as competitors for the phosphorylation site. the eukaryotic ras protein, which is encoded by the p21ras oncogene, controls cell proliferation, cell stress signaling and apoptosis. the autophosphorylaiton of ras is independent of its gtpase activity  <cit> , which means that gtp hydrolysis and gtp phosphorylation of ras occur at two different sites. at present it is unclear whether gtp hydrolysis and gtp-mediated autophosphorylation are independent events for prokaryotic obgs, and no one has identified a phsophorylation site on any obg molecule.

expression of m. tuberculosis obg is growth-dependent, and obg is associated with the membrane fraction
in the sporulating bacterium s. coelicolor, the expression of obg is regulated developmentally and is linked to the onset of sporulation  <cit> . by contrast, no such change in expression of obg occurs in c. crescentus, although it also has a clear developmental cycle involving sporulation  <cit> . m. tuberculosis is a slow growing bacterium which exhibits neither sporulation nor a developmental cell cycle during its growth in culture. to determine whether the expression of obg changes during the growth of m. tuberculosis in culture, we developed a rabbit anti-obg antiserum against m. tuberculosis his10-obg, and used it in western blots of m. tuberculosis protein extracts. this antiserum detects multiple bands in immunoblotted extracts of m. tuberculosis, particularly at  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda. to confirm that the  <dig> kda protein reacting with anti-obg antiserum is in fact obg, we cloned the coding region of obg downstream of the hsp <dig> promoter in the plasmid pmv <dig>  and transformed the resulting construct  into m. tuberculosis to overproduce obg. figure 3a shows that protein extracts of m. tuberculosis strains harboring plasmid pmvobg, but not strains bearing the vector plasmid pmv <dig>  reveal strong  <dig> kda protein bands, indicating that the protein at  <dig> kda is obg. further analysis revealed that the  <dig> kda band was a false reactivity due to the second antibody, and that it is not an obg protein.

notably, obg expression does change in cultures of m. tuberculosis over the course of cell growth. obg expression is markedly increased from early log phase to the stationary phase, with a drop in expression at late stationary phase . comparison of the obg band densities discloses that expression of obg at later growth phases  is approximately five fold higher than it is at earlier phases , even before the drop in expression at late stationary phase. together these results indicate that the expression of obg in m. tuberculosis is growth-regulated, being increased as the cells begin rapid division in the log phase, and maintained at high levels until late in the stationary phase. however, whether increased levels of obg with increased growth of m. tuberculosis is due to increased expression of obg, or to accumulation of obg, remains to be determined. obg expression in e. coli is also high in log phase growth, but decreased in the stationary phase  <cit> .

in s. griseus  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit> , obg and its orthologues are found in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. in b. subtilis, however, obg is mainly associated with the cytoplasm  <cit> . to determine where obg resides in m. tuberculosis, we isolated soluble and membrane fractions from whole bacteria, and subjected them to immunoblot analysis. figure 3c shows that obg is associated mostly  with the membrane fraction, although detectable amounts are also present in the soluble fraction. in contrast, sigh of m. tuberculosis, which was used as a control here, exhibits almost equal distribution between these two fractions. it has been reported that membrane fraction-bound obg in s. coeliocolor  <cit>  and in e. coli  <cit>  is lost from this fraction if the extraction buffer contains  <dig> mm edta. the buffer we use for m. tuberculosis membrane preparations has  <dig> mm edta, however, and obg is associated with this fraction whether or not edta is present . the edta-resistant association of m. tuberculosis obg to the membrane fraction may reflect a function associated with signaling, and involving divalent cations. interestingly, obg is absent from detergent-extracted m. tuberculosis membrane  <cit>  and cell wall  <cit>  proteins, suggesting that obg's association with the membrane may be due to its interaction with other membrane protein.

m. tuberculosis obg associates with ribosomal fractions
in b. subtilis  <cit> , c. crescentus  <cit> , v. harveyi  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit> , obg has been shown to be associated with ribosomes. in these species, obg orthologues cofractionate primarily with the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . to determine whether this is also true of m. tuberculosis obg, we isolated ribosomes from m. tuberculosis using sucrose gradient centrifugation, as detailed in the methods section . immunoblots of the separated ribosomal fractions  show that obg is present in all three  ribosomal fractions, in more or less equal amounts. by contrast, this discrepancy does not appear to be due to improper separation of ribosomal proteins in our sucrose gradient, because analysis of the ribosomal fractions in sds-page reveals that separation of proteins occurred in the expected line . the obg/cgta of e. coli and c. crescentus has been shown to interact with specific  <dig> s ribosomal proteins, and it is the opinion of the investigators in this area that obg plays a critical role in ribosome assembly. evidence in support of this hypothesis has been provided with strains producing mutant obg/cgta. for example, c. crescentus  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit>  strains expressing mutated obg have perturbed ribosomal protein profiles. a genetic basis for the involvement of obg in ribosomal assembly has also been provided in e. coli by studies in which obg was overexpressed in an rrmj mutant strain  <cit> . notably, rrmj encodes an rna methyltransferase which is involved in the assembly of  <dig> s ribosomes  <cit> . in line with these observations in bacteria, obg homologues in yeast   <cit>  and mice   <cit>  also show association with ribosome maturation and assembly. interestingly, in our studies shown here in figure  <dig>  lanes 4- <dig>  and lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  show an additional band above and below obg, respectively. we do not know whether these bands represent modified forms of obg. work in progress includes studies toward identification of these bands.

m. tuberculosis obg interacts with usfx
scott et al  <cit>  were the first to observe that b. subtilis obg interacts with upstream regulators of the stress sigma factor sigb. in this respect, this bacterium's obg resembles b. subtilis rsbt and rsbw, both of which also interact with sigb in this species  <cit> . more recently, the obg proteins of e. coli  <cit>  and v. harveyi  <cit>  have been shown to interact with spot, a stringent response regulator. since sigb, rsbw and spot-related genes are present in m. tuberculosis, we asked whether m. tuberculosis obg interacts with any or all of these proteins, in the yeast two-hybrid system. the m. tuberculosis genes coding for obg , usfx , sigf  and rela  were cloned in yeast vectors, and transformed into the yeast strain ah <dig>  table  <dig> shows that m. tuberculosis obg strongly interacts with usfx, but not with the spot-related rela protein. the strength of this interaction is comparable to the interaction of m. tuberculosis usfx with its cognate sigma factor sigf. in the same experiment, we looked for interaction of m. tuberculosis obg with various other putative anti-anti sigma factors that we have described earlier for this bacterium  <cit> , including rsbu , rsfa , rsfb , rv0516c, rv <dig> and rv <dig>  however, we observed no significant interaction of obg with any of the above anti-anti sigma factors , indicating that the interaction of m. tuberculosis obg is limited to usfx. in light of the known stress response role of usfx  <cit> , its specific interaction with obg suggests that obg plays a role in the m. tuberculosis stress response.

in b. subtilis, the activation of sigb in response to stress depends upon its association with, and dissociation from, of rsbw. in turn, this is governed by the phosphorylation state of rsbw  <cit> . the usfx protein of m. tuberculosis is believed to have similar interaction with its cognate sigma factor sigf  <cit> . whether the interaction of obg with usfx affects the phosphorylation state of usfx is unknown. additional studies assessing the interaction of obg and usfx in vitro, and careful examination of phosphate exchange in vivo, may throw light on this part of obg function. the obg/cgta proteins of e. coli and v. harveyi interact with spot, a stringent response regulator and a relative of rela, which responds to starvation. the fact that obg of m. tuberculosis fails to interact with rela suggests that the stress response roles of obg of m. tuberculosis differ from those of its homologues in other bacteria.

overexpression of obg affects late log phase growth of m. tuberculosis
since expression of obg in m. tuberculosis is growth regulated, we asked whether the presence of unusually high amounts of obg might effect on the growth of this species. to do this, we followed the growth of m. tuberculosis strains bearing the obg overexpression construct , vs. strains containing the control plasmid , over a period of time. figure  <dig> shows that there is no significant difference in growth between the two strains during the early log phase, but that the growth of the obg-expressing strain is decreased slightly in the late log phase, and that this relative decrease is continued even during the stationary phase . this indicates that overexpression of obg suppresses cell division to some extent during the late log phase of m. tuberculosis growth. similarly, increased expression of e. coli obg, through an inducible promoter, suppresses log phase growth  <cit> . in contrast, overexpression of obg has little effect on vegetative growth of s. coelicolor, but it significantly affects the development of aerial mycelia by this bacterium  <cit> . this and other examples have been used to support the proposal that an abundance of gtp-bound obg is associated with vegetative bacterial growth , while a relative abundance of gdp-bound obg promotes stationary development   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal that m. tuberculosis obg has characteristics that are common to its homologues in other bacteria, in addition to properties that are unique. generation and characterization of mutant alleles of m. tuberculosis obg should provide additional insights to the role of obg in this important human pathogen, and toward identification of antimicrobials that reduce its ability to promote m. tuberculosis survival.
