BACKGROUND
microrna  are a specific class of small rna involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation in a wide variety of species. typical mirna are single-stranded rna molecules approximately  <dig> nucleotides in length  <cit> . in animals, mirnas are cut from a longer, single-stranded rna precursor that forms a hairpin loop structure by two endonucleases, drosha and dicer, assisted by auxiliary protein factors  <cit> . mature mirna function as a component of an rna-protein complex known as rna-induced silencing complex . as a part of the complex, mirna guides it to specific gene targets through base-pairing interaction between the mirna seed region and a complementary sequence in the mrna. in humans and other animals, the seed region normally extends from the second to eighth positions of mature mirna  <cit> . within mrna, mirna target sites are mainly located within its 3'utr, although a few mirna binding sites are found in 5'utr and the coding region  <cit> . interaction between risc and mrna normally leads to somewhat moderate repression of gene expression, usually through both translation inhibition and mrna degradation  <cit> . such mirna-assisted gene repression was shown to play an essential role in many development and differentiation pathways across species  <cit> .

from their discovery in 1990s, numbers of identified mirna are increasing rapidly  <cit> . at present, there are  <dig> mirna annotated in the human genome . the main criteria for mirna identification are:  presence of a sequence motive capable of forming a hairpin structure over at least  <dig> nucleotides devoid of large loops and bulges, and  expression of a distinct rna sequence approximately  <dig> nucleotide in length, originating from one of the hairpin arms  <cit> . within the human genome, close to  <dig>  regions could form long unbranched hairpin structures which, if transcribed and processed, can result in mature mirna  <cit> . some of these sequences are not conserved across species and tend to be expressed at low levels  <cit> . such sequences, although capable of becoming functional mirna over long evolutionary time  <cit> , might not have any immediate functional significance  <cit> . still, as our knowledge of human mirna expression across tissues and ontogenetic stages is incomplete, the full variety of human functional mirna is not known  <cit> . specifically, many evolutionary conserved sequences capable of forming mirna precursor hairpins still lack evidence of mature mirna expression. further, highly expressed and fast evolving functional mirna that are lacking sequence conservation might still be missed. here, we attempt to partially fill this gap by comprehensive characterization of human and rhesus macaque mirna transcriptome in a specific brain region, namely the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, using deep high-throughput sequencing.

RESULTS
small rna sequencing and characterization
to get a comprehensive view of small rna expressed in human and rhesus macaque dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we sequenced rna fraction with sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  in  <dig> human and  <dig> rhesus macaque healthy male individuals, using illumina genome analyzer. to obtain maximal representation of small rna, we included samples covering most of the human and rhesus macaque lifespans: from birth to  <dig> years of age for humans, and from birth to  <dig> years of age for macaques . combining these samples, we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, corresponding to  <dig>  unique sequences in humans, and a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads, corresponding to  <dig>  unique sequences in macaques. allowing no mismatches and only considering the sequences represented by at least two reads,  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads could be mapped to the human genome and  <dig> , <dig> sequences reads to the rhesus macaque genome .

out of all sequence reads that map to the human genome,  <dig> % correspond to  <dig> annotated human mirna. similarly, in rhesus macaques,  <dig> % of all mapped reads correspond to  <dig> macaque orthologs of annotated human mirna  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , mirna are expressed in brain at a broad concentration range, spanning more than six orders of magnitude . consequently, as much as 88% of all sequence reads mapped to mirna correspond to  <dig> highly expressed mirna in both humans and rhesus macaques . on the other hand, many mirna are represented by only a few sequence reads. despite the low abundance, most of these mirna are highly conserved among mammals and some, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  were shown to function in other tissues  <cit> . low expression of these mirna in our dataset may be due to the following reasons: they are expressed in a limited number of brain cells, or they play no functional role in the prefrontal cortex and are expressed at the "background" transcription level. importantly, this result indicates that novel human and macaque mirna that do not function in postnatal prefrontal cortex or functional in a limited set of cells can still be detected in our dataset at low expression levels.

novel mirna identification
to identify potential novel mirna, we further analyzed the  <dig> , <dig> human and  <dig> , <dig> rhesus macaque sequence reads that remained after excluding the reads mapped to the annotated mirna. during mirna maturation, the pre-mirna hairpin can produce two different mature mirna, one from each of the hairpin arms. while  <dig> mirna precursors are known to produce two mature mirna,  <dig> are annotated to produce just one . therefore, we first searched for yet undiscovered mirna originating from the known precursors. using this approach,  <dig> and  <dig> such mirna, each supported by at least two sequence reads, can be identified in humans and rhesus macaques, respectively. while these mirna would be commonly classified as mirna-star , a low expressed by-product of mirna generation, some of them are highly expressed, both relatively and absolutely. specifically, out of  <dig> novel human mirna*,  <dig> are expressed higher than their annotated counterpart originating from the same precursor, and  <dig> are expressed at copy number greater than  <dig> . thus, many of the  <dig> novel human mirna* might be as functional as their annotated mirna counterparts.

next, we identified putative mirna originating from novel precursors using two established approaches. in the first approach, we used rnalfold  <cit> , to identify transcribed genomic regions that can form stable non-branching hairpin structures containing at least  <dig> basepairs within hairpin stem  <cit> . we then used mipred  <cit> , a random forest-based classification algorithm, to identify hairpins with sequence features characteristic to precursors of known human mirna. we used hairpins derived from exon regions as a negative set . out of  <dig> known human and  <dig> known macaque mirna represented in our dataset,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, passed this identification pipeline, indicating high sensitivity of this method . applying it to the rest of the dataset, we identify  <dig>  putative human mirna, each represented by at least two sequence reads. among these mirna,  <dig> originate within other annotated ncrna. for the rhesus dataset, we find  <dig>  putative mirna,  <dig> originating from other annotated ncrna .

in the second approach, we used the mirdeep algorithm to identify patterns of short sequence reads characteristic to mirna precursors  <cit> . as this approach requires substantial read-density, mirna represented by few sequence reads will not be identified. consequently, out of  <dig> known human mirna represented in our dataset, only  <dig>  passed the mirdeep algorithm with high confidence level criteria. using the same criteria, mirdeep identifies  <dig> and  <dig> putative novel human and rhesus macaque mirna, respectively. out of these mirna,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, overlap with putative mirna predicted by the first approach . this overlap is much greater than expected by chance , even though the two mirna prediction methods employ very different mirna identification strategies.

novel mirna sequence conservation
as the function of mirna depends on their sequence, functional mirna are expected be conserved. among the total of  <dig>  putative human mirna identified by either of the two approaches,  <dig> map within genomic regions corresponding to known non-coding rna , such as trna, snrna, or snorna. such putative mirna might be conserved on the dna sequence level as a part of longer functional transcripts and, therefore, were excluded from the conservation analysis. to assess sequence conservation of the remaining  <dig>  putative novel human mirna , we used phastcon scores based on the genomic sequence comparison among  <dig> placental mammals  <cit> . we find that  <dig> identified putative human mirna are highly conserved among mammals , while  <dig> would be expected to score as high by chance  . further,  <dig>  of these conserved mirna are also expressed in rhesus macaques and pass our mirna-identification procedure, while  <dig> % are expected by chance . in rhesus macaques, we find additional  <dig> putative conserved mirna, all of which can also be found in the human genome, but are not expressed in the human dataset.

certainly, the proportion of highly conserved mirna is much smaller for the putative novel mirna than for the annotated mirna . this, however, is due to the fact that many annotated mirna were first identified based on their sequence conservation  <cit> .

* mirna annotation of rhesus macaque used for labelling of the identified novel mirna-star sequences is based on human annotation by mapping of macaque mirna precursors to the human genome by the reciprocal liftover.

still, conservation of putative mirna sequences alone is not a sufficient proof of their functionality. most mammalian mrnas recognize their target genes through basepairing interaction between 7-mer sequence at the 5'-end of mirna, known as a seed region, and a complimentary sequence at the target's 3' utr. thus, for many annotated conserved mirna, the complementary target sequences show increased conservation as well  <cit> . based on this property, we can further assess functionality of conserved putative novel mirna. as several mirna may share the same seed sequence, we combined all conserved mirna into families, each containing a unique seed. this resulted in  <dig> annotated and  <dig> putative human mirna families. for each family, we determined a target conservation score using a previously published approach  <cit> . briefly, the method tests whether 3' utr sequences complimentary to the chosen mirna seed region are more conserved among mammals than the control sequences. the control sequences are 3' utr sequences complimentary to a scrambled seed region and occurring within 3' utrs at a similar frequency . using this method,  <dig> %  of annotated mirna families and  <dig> %  of putative mirna families show significant excess of conserved target sequences . as the test is sensitive to the number of potential target sites, mirna targeting few genes may not pass the significance cut-off. this could explain the low sensitivity of the test for both annotated and novel mirna families. still, for both annotated and novel mirna, the proportion of families with significant excess of conserved target sequences is greater than expected by chance  . thus, a sizable proportion of conserved putative mirna identified in this study is likely to be functional.

novel mirna expression
the vast majority of putative mirna identified in this study, both conserved and non-conserved, are expressed at low levels . many of non-conserved putative mirna may result from spurious processing of transcribed hairpin structures by drosha and dicer and have no immediate functional significance, as suggested previously  <cit> . still, some show relatively high expression:  <dig> out of  <dig>  non-conserved putative human mirna are represented by more than a  <dig>  sequence reads, and  <dig> - by more than a  <dig> . some of these putative mirna  originate from repetitive genomic regions . although some mirna originating within repeats were suggested to be functional  <cit> , proving this would require further evidence. conserved putative mirna, on the other hand, might be functional even when present at low levels in our dataset, as they may function in specific cell types, tissues, and/or ontogenetic stages not captured by our study.

novel mirna originating from other ncrna
small rna originating from highly expressed transcripts, such as known ncrna, might represent degradation products of longer transcripts and, therefore, are commonly excluded from the mirna identification studies  <cit> . recent work, however, has shown that some small rna originating from other ncrna can function as mirna  <cit> . among all putative human mirna sequences identified in this study,  <dig> are contained within known ncrna transcripts,  <dig> of them conserved among placental mammals. similarly, in rhesus macaques we find  <dig> putative mirna originated from other ncrna,  <dig> of them conserved among placental mammals. out of a total of  <dig> conserved putative human mirna,  <dig> originate from five ncrna types: c/d box snorna, h/aca box snorna, scarna, snrna, and trna .

to assess whether these ncrna fragments could function as mirna, we analyzed the sequence conservation of their predicted target sites within 3' utrs of protein-coding genes. we find that out of  <dig> seed families derived from  <dig> conserved putative human mirna,  <dig>  show significant excess of conserved target sequences  . this proportion is higher than the background one , but not significantly . thus, overall we do not find a support for ncrna-derived putative mirna functionality.

still, the highest expressed ncrna-derived putative mirna identified in our study comes from a member of scarna family, aca <dig> rna, previously shown to give rise to a functional mature mirna  <cit>  . the seed region of this mirna shows marginally significant excess of conserved target sites , further supporting its functional significance. overall, out of all  <dig> ncrna-derived conserved human putative mirna,  <dig> show significant enrichment of conserved target sites . among them is another highly expressed putative mirna derived from a member of scarna family, aca <dig> rna . this putative mirna, along with mirna originating from aca <dig> rna, were shown to co-precipitate in complex with human ago proteins, indicating its potential functionality  <cit> .

notably, out of  <dig> ncrna-derived putative mirna identified in our study, another  <dig> mirna have significantly fewer conserved target sites in all annotated mrna 3' utrs than expected by chance . this indicates long-term selective pressure on 3' utr sequences to avoid targeting by these putative mirna. such a situation may arise when generation of mirna-like molecules from these ncrna has a detrimental effect on gene expression regulation. at the same time, functional constraints on ncrna sequences conserve features leading to hairpin recognition by mirna processing machinery.

supporting this notion, the two putative mirna with the lowest target conservation are highly expressed in our dataset . one of them originates from h/aca box snorna and another from trna-ile. interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that in mouse embryonic stem cells, trna-ile can form an alternative long hairpin structure, recognized by dicer, instead of the typical "clover leaf" structure  <cit> . in humans, the trna-ile can also form an alternative long hairpin structure with low free energy . processing of such a long hairpin structure could generate mirna-like molecules detected in our study . similarly, aca <dig> rna snorna forms a long hairpin structure that could potentially be recognized by mirna processing machinery . small rna resulting from this processing, however, appear to play deleterious roles in gene regulatory networks, rather than being incorporated into them as functional mirna.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we take advantage of the high throughput sequencing technology to obtain a comprehensive view of small rnas expressed in the human and rhesus macaque brain cortex. sequencing deeply, we detect both mirna that function in brain and mirna expressed as "background" transcripts. this gives us an opportunity to identify putative novel mirna that may function in tissues and ontogenetic stages not included in our analysis.

it has to be noted, however, that mirna expression levels determined in our study may not fully reflect actual mirna concentrations within the tissue. as shown previously, the results of mirna concentrations estimates tend to vary substantially between high-throughput sequencing and microarrays  <cit> , as well as mirna between different high-throughput sequencing methodologies  <cit> . thus, although estimated mirna expression levels do, to an extent, reflect actual mirna concentrations, the technical biases of the high-throughput sequencing technology used limit our ability when investigating expression level correlations and relationship between mirna expression and target site abundance.

another limitation of our study is that our analysis of novel mirna functionality. it is based on the target site conservation and, therefore, can only be applied to evolutionary conserved mirna. thus, fast evolving mirna will not be classified as functional in this analysis. nonetheless, since most of non-conserved putative mirna identified in our study are low-expressed, the numbers of potential functional fast-evolving mirna present in the human brain are likely to be small. the few identified highly expressed non-conserved putative mirna tend to originate within repeated regions, making it difficult to infer their functionality.

we further identify  <dig> and  <dig> conserved putative mirna originating from ncrna in humans and rhesus macaques, respectively. some of these putative mirna show significant excess of conserved target sites and might function as conventional mirna. others, however, might interfere with the existing regulatory networks, resulting in target avoidance.

finally, in humans and macaques, we identify  <dig> putative novel mirna, highly conserved among mammals, with  <dig> detected in both species. although most of these putative mirna are expressed at low levels in our dataset, they show significant excess of conserved target sites in the 3'utrs of protein-coding genes. this indicates a substantial proportion of identified putative mirna may indeed represent functional mirna. given the sequencing depth of our study, it is likely that these novel mirna capture most of the yet unidentified conserved human mirna repertoire.
