BACKGROUND
rare or so-called orphan diseases, which affect only a very small number of individuals, have been identified in both humans and domestic animal species. the majority of rare diseases are caused by altered functions of single genes. although the individual diseases are rare, collectively they are common, affecting millions of people worldwide  <cit> . in non-laboratory animals, the number of rare genetic diseases is unknown, but online mendelian inheritance in animals , a catalogue of inherited disorders and associated genes in animals, reports more than  <dig> phenotypes in eleven domestic animal species  <cit> . currently, the gene mutation responsible for approximately 20% of rare diseases in domestic animals has been determined  <cit> . this has been accomplished over the past 25 years either by the targeted analysis of individual candidate genes or labor- and resource-intensive positional cloning approaches, such as linkage mapping or genome-wide association studies  <cit> . for this purpose, a series of cases showing an identical phenotype was needed  <cit> . the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, in combination with the establishment of a reference genome sequence for domestic animal species, such as for the bovine genome in  <dig>  <cit> , have changed the prospects enormously  <cit> . today, studying the molecular aetiology of single cases is also feasible, e.g., in cattle  <cit> , as has been successfully carried out in humans for approximately five years now  <cit> .

congenital skin fragility, also called epidermolysis bullosa , represents a heterogeneous group of rare diseases reported in different species, including livestock animals. in the majority of cases it is genetically determined and, in humans, 18 eb-associated genes have currently been identified which encode the structural proteins involved in epidermal and dermal adhesion  <cit> . various eb forms have been described in cattle  <cit> , but the associated genes  have been identified for only two outbreaks of recessively inherited eb forms   <cit> . as is known for eb in other domestic animals, these two bovine eb diseases were genetically characterised by analysing well-known eb candidate genes  <cit> .

a single case of severe congenital eb was observed in charolais cattle. the purpose of this study was to characterise the phenotype in comparison to the known eb forms of different species. in parallel, a whole genome sequencing-based mutation analysis was carried out focusing on known eb candidates, and an associated loss-of-function mutation in the integrin beta  <dig>  gene was detected.

RESULTS
phenotype description
a single purebred, female charolais calf of  <dig>  kg was delivered full-term and died immediately after birth. the calf underwent post-mortem examination at the chemisches und veterinäruntersuchungsamt westfalen . the calf exhibited multifocally extensive alopecia, erosions and ulcers on the rump, head, and external surfaces of the pinnae, eyelids, nose, muzzle, lips and distal extremities with onychomadesis of all four feet . parts of the small intestine protruded through the navel. the hairless skin showed crusts and multiple small vesicles at the border with the haired skin . there were severe oral lesions with focally missing cutaneous mucous membranes of the gingiva, hard palate, and on the back  and ventral aspect of the tongue. there were linear skin defects at the anal- and vulvocutaneous junctions. no other gross lesions were detected.figure  <dig>

histopathological and ultrastructural findings
histological examination of the affected skin lesions or oral mucous membranes multifocally confirmed a complete loss of the epidermis or the epithelium which was covered by serocellular crusts. the underlying dermis or submucosa multifocally showed mild to moderate, acute, diffuse haemorrhages and a mild infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. the adjacent skin or mucous membranes displayed severe, subepidermal or subepithelial cleft formations of various lengths occasionally filled with eosinophilic, proteinacious fluid, cellular debris, haemorrhage and single neutrophils. the cleft formation extended around the hair follicles in varying degrees . periodic acid-schiff -reaction identified the basement membrane associated with the floor of the cleft. consequently, the cleft formation was located between the basal layers of the epithelial cells and the basement membrane. ultrastructurally, the cleft formation was located in the lamina lucida of the basement membrane. the lamina densa was attached to the dermis .figure  <dig>

mutation analysis
the dam of the affected calf showed no clinically visible skin anomalies. in addition, the owner did not observe any similar congenitally malformed newborns in his herd. unfortunately, the identity of the sire could not be determined as the farmer keeps more than  <dig> cows and some natural service sires which were used simultaneously had already been slaughtered. since it was difficult to predict whether the disease was dominantly or recessively inherited without family information, we hypothesised two different possible scenarios: either a fully penetrant dominant acting de novo mutation which occurred in a single parental gamete or happened during early embryonic development of the calf, or a recessively inherited mutation present in the homozygous state transmitted by both parents due to inbreeding.

first, a recent dominant de novo mutation was hypothesised and the entire genome of the affected animal was therefore sequenced in order to detect all the variants in the known eb comparative candidate genes. a total of  <dig> , <dig> 100 bp paired-end reads were collected from a shotgun fragment library corresponding roughly to a  <dig>  fold coverage of the genome. the single nucleotide variants, and short insertions or deletions were called and compared to the reference genome and  <dig>  high quality variants across the entire exome, including untranslated regions and 10 bp of flanking introns, were detected. the variants were additionally compared with  <dig> cow genomes of various breeds which had been sequenced in our laboratory in the course of other ongoing studies. assuming that the causative variant would be completely absent in these controls but present in the affected calf, a total of  <dig> variants, of which  <dig> were coding variants, occurred privately only in the eb-affected calf and were not present in any control. for these variants, a total of  <dig> effects on annotated genes and loci were predicted . of the  <dig> coding variants,  <dig> were present in the heterozygous state and  <dig> in the homozygous state. this analysis revealed no exomic sequence variants located within one of the 18 eb candidate genes. in addition, larger deletions in the sequenced case and in  <dig> control cow genomes with a genome-wide coverage of more than  <dig> fold were searched for. a total of  <dig> deletions were private deletions occurring only in the genome of the affected charolais animal in which a single  <dig>  kb deletion was detected in the region of one of the comparative candidate genes , starting at position  <dig> , <dig> on cattle chromosome  <dig> . visual inspection of the mapped sequence reads confirmed the presence of a large  deletion in the itgb <dig> gene affecting six coding exons  with breakpoints in intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> . the presence of the genomic deletion in the homozygous state was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction  and agarose gel electrophoresis . to prove and define the precise breakpoints of this deletion, the obtained pcr products were sequenced. in this way, it was possible to sequence a previously uncharacterised sequence gap in the bovine reference sequence which was present in intron  <dig>  revealing that this region is 404 bp shorter than presented in the reference sequence . this detailed analysis finally showed that the exact size of the deletion on chromosome  <dig> was 4405 bp .figure  <dig> 
genetic characterisation of the itgb <dig> mutation. whole genome sequencing of the affected calf  revealed the presence of a homozygous 4809 bp sized deletion on cattle chromosome  <dig> . the deleted segment contains the coding exons  <dig> to  <dig> of the itgb <dig> gene . note that, taking into account the gap in the reference sequence, the actual size of the deletion is 4405 bp. a diagnostic pcr performed on genomic dna using a combination of three allele-specific primers allows genotype differentiation . the gel picture shows the affected calf , its heterozygous dam  and a normal control .



in addition, under the assumption of a possible recessive mutation, it was decided to apply a homozygosity mapping approach to determine the homozygous regions in the genome of the affected calf. it was hypothesised that the affected animal would be identical by descent for the causative mutation and flanking chromosomal segments due to parents which shared a common ancestor. the genotypes of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  were analysed and the genotypes were checked for extended regions of homozygosity. a total of  <dig> genomic regions larger than 1 mb were located on different cattle chromosomes . the largest homozygous region by far was located on cattle chromosome  <dig>  containing  <dig>  snp markers and corresponding to a  <dig>  mb interval from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb . within this genomic segment,  <dig> of the  <dig> known eb comparative candidate genes were located in the bovine genome including the itgb <dig> gene which contains the above mentioned large genomic deletion. to experimentally prove the inheritance of this deletion, a diagnostic pcr was designed . this analysis confirmed the homozygous genotype of the affected calf and showed that the dam was carrying a single copy of the deletion . as expected, normal controls showed a single band of 390 bp, the homozygous affected calf showed a single band of 750 bp and the heterozygous dam showed both pcr products. genotyping was carried out on a total of  <dig> charolais cattle belonging to the herd into which the affected calf was born. this revealed that the homozygous mutant genotype was absent in all animals but we identified a total of  <dig> heterozygous carriers including the maternal grandmother of the affected calf. due to missing detailed pedigree records we were not able to identify a possible common ancestor among the disease allele carriers. finally, a total of  <dig> unrelated charolais sires which were used for artificial insemination in germany and  <dig> controls from various breeds were tested negatively for the presence of the itgb <dig> deletion.figure  <dig>

discussion
the skin fragility phenotype observed in a charolais calf resembles previous reports of epidermolysis bullosa and epitheliogenesis imperfecta in calves  <cit> . since epitheliogenesis imperfecta is not genetically defined and an in-depth pathological examination is necessary for distinction, both conditions might have been confused in the past and recorded in veterinary literature. epidermolysis bullosa is a mechanobullous disorder and is classified into three groups according to the ultrastructural location of the blistering between the epidermis and the dermis. in eb simplex, the blister formation tissue separation occurs within the epidermal basal keratinocytes adjacent to the basal lamina. in junctional eb, the blister formation arises within the lamina lucida of the basal lamina. in dystrophic eb, the blister formation takes place at the dermal side of the basal lamina below the lamina densa. which subtype of eb develops and how severe the lesions are depend on the functional defects of particular proteins. all three types of eb have been reported in cattle  <cit> . ultrastructurally, the case reported in a charolais calf could clearly be identified as eb junctionalis . there is high morphologically agreement with another case of ebj in this breed  <cit>  in which, based on immuno-histological examination, a deficient expression of integrin α6β <dig> was hypothesised as being a possible cause. the identification of a loss-of-function mutation in the bovine itgb <dig> gene could finally confirm this suspicion since the current case belongs to the same breed. in regard to the recessive inheritance of the deletion identified one can hypothesise that the mutation was possibly already present more than ten years ago in the french charolais population. a likely scenario could be that, due to the importation of semen or living sires which were heterozygous for the mutation, the defective allele was introgressed into the german charolais population. alternatively, it could be that the formerly reported french case was caused by an independent itgb <dig> mutation.

mutations in itgb <dig> are known to cause ebj in humans  <cit> . the integrins are cell membrane receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits which orchestrate adhesive events in all tissues of the body. in the skin, they play an essential role in the architecture of the hemidesmosomes which mediate the stable attachment of the basal epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane  <cit> . due to the severity of ebj in this case, a very likely causative mutation in the coding region of one of the well-characterised candidate genes was hypothesised. the approach of whole genome sequencing allowed the consideration of two possible scenarios: a recent dominant acting de novo mutation or a recessively inherited mutation which had already occurred some generations ago. that the ebj phenotype could be explained by a recessive itgb <dig> deletion which was very likely responsible for a similar case already one decade ago was able to be shown  <cit> . the transcript of the mutant allele lacked information regarding a significant part of the encoded protein since the deletion led to a frameshift and a premature stop codon. it was therefore assumed that the mutant transcripts probably underwent nonsense mediated decay so that, in the final analysis, the deletion represented a loss-of-function mutation with a non-existing integrin protein in the epidermis of the affected animal. in humans, a broad spectrum of clinical and morphological ebj manifestations exists associated with itgb <dig> mutations  <cit> . they range from non-lethal forms with very mild skin features to severe lethal phenotypes  <cit> . to date, at least  <dig> different mutations in human itgb <dig> have been reported  <cit> . pyloric atresia, which found regularly in humans suffering from the altered synthesis of integrin α6β <dig>  was not detected in either of the affected charolais calves  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents a recessively inherited itgb <dig> associated ebj form in cattle. selection against this candidate causative mutation can now be used to eliminate this genetic disorder from charolais cattle in production systems. the results obtained showed that current dna sequencing methods offer a powerful tool for understanding the genetic background of rare diseases in domestic animals with a reference genome sequence available.
