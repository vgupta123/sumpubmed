BACKGROUND
the members of the tgf-β superfamily of cytokines, which consists of tgf-βs, bone morphogenetic proteins  and activins, exert potent effects on proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation on many different cell types, including primary b cells  <cit> . the signalling is initiated through heterotetrameric complexes of type i and type ii receptors. the cytokines bind to a type ii receptor, and type i is recruited and activated through phosphorylation. there are five type ii and seven type i receptors which form complexes with the tgf-β superfamily of cytokines. tgf-β induces signalling through tgf-β receptor type ii  and alk- <dig> , whereas activin a and b induce signalling through activin receptor type ii , activin receptor type ii b , alk- <dig> and alk- <dig>   <cit> . the intracellular receptor regulated smad proteins  are phosphorylated by the type i receptors. smad <dig> and  <dig> are the main r-smads involved in tgf-β and activin signalling  <cit> ; although several recent reports have shown that tgf-β can induce smad1/5/ <dig> signalling as well  <cit> . bmps activate smad1/5/ <dig>  r-smads interact with the common smad, smad <dig>  and translocate to the nucleus, where the complex, together with other transcription factors, regulates gene expression of e.g. pai- <dig>  pai- <dig> plays an important role throughout many cell systems, and is involved in cell motility, angiogenesis and cancer progression  <cit>  in addition to anti-proliferative activity  <cit> . it has been shown that inhibitory smads, smad <dig> and  <dig>  inhibit the pathway at several levels, i.e. interaction between r-smad and receptor or between r-smads and smad <dig>  <cit> . there is extensive crosstalk with other signalling pathways, such as p <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  jnk, pi3k and wnt  <cit> . it is suggested that this regulation often occurs through phosphorylation of the linker region of r-smads, which can be activating or inhibitory to the effects of tgf-βs, activins or bmps.

in cancer, tgf-β frequently loses its anti-proliferative effects, and sometimes gains pro-proliferative features, often associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and metastasis of epithelial cells. loss of anti-proliferative effects can be due to mutations, gene silencing or over-expression of inhibitors  <cit> . in lymphoma and other haematological malignancies, aberrant expression of receptors and mutations in smads have been found, although the reported frequencies of aberrations involving the tgf-β pathway in lymphoma are lower than in many other cancer types  <cit> . for example, down-regulation of tβrii rna has been demonstrated in burkitt lymphoma  cell lines which express the full range of latent ebv genes  <cit> .

our aim was to elucidate the effects of tgf-β and activin a on lymphoma cell lines, to study the signalling pathways involved and to look for possible mechanisms behind sensitivity or resistance to these cytokines. we suggest that signalling through smad1/ <dig> can be important for maintaining sensitivity to tgf-β growth inhibitory effects. in addition, constitutively active p <dig> mapk indicates a role for this kinase in the regulation of tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.

RESULTS
b-cell lymphoma show reduced sensitivity to tgf-β compared to primary b cells
many cancer types develop resistance to tgf-β-induced growth inhibition. we tested the anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β on  <dig> different b-cell lymphoma cell lines, and compared these results to human peripheral blood cd19+ b cells. for further studies on signalling we selected five of these cell lines; three of these showed high sensitivity to tgf-β treatment; although not to the same extent as primary b cells, whereas two were resistant to the growth inhibiting effects of tgf-β . in line with previously published data, tgf-β treatment of primary b cells inhibited proliferation by 85% compared to non-treated control b cells . more data on additional cell lines are included in additional file  <dig>  fig. s <dig> .

in addition to tgf-β, we tested the anti-proliferative effects of activin a and b, and detected no major effects on proliferation by these cytokines . primary b cells were partly inhibited by activin a, with a mean inhibition of 34% .

additionally, we measured cell division to compare the effects of tgf-β in sensitive and resistant cells. in the resistant sudhl- <dig> cells no inhibition of cell division was detected. in contrast, tgf-β induced a clear inhibition in bl- <dig> cells after three days, as evidenced by the cfse histograms .

tgf-β sensitive cell lines express high cell surface levels of alk-5
to determine the role of the different tgf-β receptors during smad signalling in b-cell lymphoma, we measured endogenous cell surface levels of the receptors alk- <dig>  alk- <dig> and tβrii by flow cytometry on lymphoma cell lines and primary b cells. the tgf-β sensitive cell lines expressed higher levels of alk- <dig> compared to the resistant cell lines and primary b cells . the specificity of the anti-alk- <dig> antibody was tested by blocking with the peptide used for immunization before flow cytometry . tβrii was expressed in all cell lines tested and in primary b cells, with no striking differences between tgf-β sensitive and resistant cell lines . alk- <dig> was expressed at low levels . furthermore, the type i and type ii activin receptors  were similarly expressed in all cell lines . it has been shown that tgf-β can signal through the bmp-receptors alk- <dig> and alk- <dig>  <cit> . we therefore examined the expression levels of these two bmp type i receptors. of the sensitive cell lines, only ros- <dig> expressed low levels of alk- <dig> and alk- <dig>  whereas ramos expressed some alk- <dig> and higher levels of alk- <dig> .

activation of smad1/ <dig> in tgf-β sensitive cells
to investigate signalling pathways triggered by tgf-β, western immunoblotting analysis was performed. tgf-β induced activation of the canonical smad <dig> pathway in primary b cells  and in all cell lines, except k- <dig> . however, we detected no major differences in levels of smad <dig> phosphorylation between sensitive and resistant cell lines. recently, there has been focus on tgf-β signalling through smad1/ <dig> in addition to smad2/ <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, in the sensitive cell lines as well as in primary b cells, tgf-β induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation . immunoblotting with anti-psmad1/5/ <dig> and anti-psmad1/ <dig> was comparable, indicating that smad <dig> is not important in tgf-β signalling in b-cell lymphoma . activin a, which had limited effects on proliferation, induced phosphorylation of smad <dig> only in the tgf-β sensitive cell lines. phosphorylation of smad1/ <dig> was not detected after activin a treatment . we examined endogenous levels of smad <dig> and smad <dig> proteins, and found that ramos and ros- <dig> cells expressed higher levels of smad <dig> compared to the other cell lines. no major differences in smad <dig> levels were observed . taken together, the data suggest that smad1/ <dig> is involved in controlling the anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β in b-cell lymphoma cell lines.

to check whether inhibitory smads play a role in resistance to tgf-β, we assessed the endogenous protein levels of smad <dig> and  <dig>  however, only minor differences in expression levels were seen when comparing the different cell lines .

activation of tgf-β target genes
to investigate whether the tgf-β-induced signalling continued into the nucleus and up-regulated known tgf-β target genes, we measured pai- <dig> mrna. interestingly, tgf-β induced up-regulation of pai- <dig> in two of the sensitive cell lines . in addition, we demonstrated that id <dig>  a known bmp target gene, was induced to different degrees upon tgf-β treatment in the sensitive cell lines . the resistant cell lines showed no up-regulation of either of these target genes . these data imply that there are differences between tgf-β sensitive and resistant cell lines regarding induction of tgf-β target genes.

p <dig> mapk is constitutive active in tgf-β sensitive cells
we further investigated other signalling pathways known to crosstalk with the canonical smad pathway. of interest, we found high constitutive levels of phosphorylated p <dig> mapk  in the tgf-β sensitive cell lines . the resistant cell lines expressed minimal levels of active p <dig> mapk compared to the sensitive cell lines. we also found high constitutive levels of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> mapk  in the tgf-β resistant cell lines, but also in one of the sensitive cell lines . tgf-β did not affect the level of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  screening of other activated signalling molecules, i.e. phosphorylated akt, jnk mapk, tak and mkk 3/ <dig> did not reveal any correlation to sensitivity or resistance to tgf-β .

due to high levels of activated erk1/ <dig> mapk in the resistant cell lines, and the fact that this can alter the canonical smad signalling pathway through phosphorylation of the linker region, we investigated phosphorylation levels of the smad <dig>  and smad <dig>  linker regions. smad <dig> linker phosphorylation was detectable in two tgf-β sensitive cell lines, and tgf-β only slightly altered the level of linker phosphorylation in these cell lines . in contrast, no major differences in smad <dig> linker region phosphorylation were observed between the sensitive and resistant cell lines. these results imply that activated erk1/ <dig> mapk could be involved in resistance to tgf-β in b-cell lymphoma cell lines, although phosphorylation of the linker region of smad <dig> seems not to be the mechanism. we suggest that activated p <dig> mapk could be important for sensitivity to tgf-β.

inhibition of p <dig> mapk leads to reduced sensitivity to tgf-β
to test whether p <dig> contributes to tgf-β sensitivity, we used the p38-specific inhibitor sb <dig> in the tgf-β sensitive cell line ramos. when phosphorylation of p <dig> was inhibited, we observed reduced sensitivity to tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects compared to the control group . tgf-β induced cell death in 39% of the cells, whereas tgf-β together with sb <dig> differed significantly with 29% cell death . the p <dig> inhibitor also reduced tgf-β-induced apoptosis as determined by tunel analysis . inhibition of erk1/ <dig> mapk did not alter the effects of tgf-β on the resistant cell lines . thus, inhibition of p <dig> mapk partially counteracts tgf-β-induced growth suppression in ramos cells, suggesting a role for p <dig> mapk in the regulation of tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.

discussion
it is known from several cancer types that tgf-β loses its anti-proliferative effects, often due to mutations in receptors or smad proteins  <cit> . haematological malignancies, especially b-cell lymphoma, have received less attention regarding tgf-β signalling. we sought to elucidate the effects of tgf-β on cell lines from different b-cell lymphoma subtypes, working with endogenous levels of gene expression. we found that the b-cell lymphoma cell lines examined displayed reduced sensitivity to tgf-β compared to primary b cells. this indicates that loss of sensitivity towards the growth inhibitory effects of tgf-β can be of importance for the development of b-cell lymphoma.

although smad <dig> and  <dig> are the main r-smads for tgf-β signalling, we found no clear differences in tgf-β-induced smad <dig> signalling when comparing sensitive and resistant cell lines. moreover, we detected that activin a and b exerted limited anti-proliferative effects on the b-cell lymphoma cell lines, even though clear smad <dig> signalling was observed in the tgf-β-sensitive cell lines upon activin a stimulation. this further indicates that smad <dig> phosphorylation is not directly correlated to inhibition of proliferation. of note, recent studies have revealed that tgf-β can also activate the smad1/5/ <dig> pathway. interestingly, we observed a clear correlation between sensitivity to tgf-β and smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation as tgf-β induced phosphorylation of smad1/ <dig> in sensitive cell lines only. smad1/ <dig> signalling upon tgf-β treatment has to our knowledge previously not been reported in primary b cells. these data suggest that signalling through smad1/ <dig> is important for the functional effects of tgf-β on b-cell lymphoma cell lines of different origin. in agreement with our data, munoz et al. have previously reported induction of smad <dig> phosphorylation upon tgf-β treatment in follicular lymphoma cell lines and one diffuse large b-cell lymphoma cell line  <cit> . moreover, they demonstrated that the functional effects of tgf-β were diminished upon treatment with smad <dig> sirna. taken together, available data suggest that smad1/ <dig> is crucial for the anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β.

we found that sensitive cell lines showed higher endogenous alk- <dig> levels and this expression correlated to smad1/ <dig> activation, as it was highly expressed in the cell lines where tgf-β induced phosphorylation of smad1/ <dig>  similar results have been found in other cell systems  <cit> . data by wrighton et al. suggest that alk- <dig> has the ability to phosphorylate smad <dig>  and that smad <dig> can co-precipitate alk- <dig> in hek293t cells. in other cell systems, additional receptors have been demonstrated to be necessary. daly et al. proved that tβrii and alk- <dig> were required, but not sufficient for smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . they found that alk- <dig> or alk- <dig> can co-precipitate with tβrii and alk- <dig>  and that forming of the receptor complexes is dependent on cell type. among the cell lines which induced smad1/ <dig> signalling, only ramos expressed some alk- <dig> and higher levels of alk- <dig>  alk- <dig> was expressed at such low levels that it is unlikely to be involved. this was expected, because alk- <dig> is believed to be present only in endothelial cells  <cit> . tβrii is most likely involved in smad <dig> and smad1/ <dig> signalling in our cell lines, as it is the only known type ii receptor for tgf-β  <cit> . however, the tβrii expression level differed in both sensitive and resistant cell lines. smad <dig> signalling upon activin a stimulation is detected in ramos, ros- <dig> and bl- <dig> cells. abrogated smad <dig> signalling in the other cell lines is most likely not due to reduced expression of receptors, as we detected nearly equal expression of all known activin receptors in our cell lines. thus, alk- <dig> might be the receptor which is crucial for smad1/ <dig> signalling and tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.

previous work has shown a correlation between activated p <dig> mapk and the apoptotic effects of tgf-β in bl- <dig> cells  <cit> . in accordance with this study, we found that p <dig> was constitutively phosphorylated in cell lines sensitive to growth inhibition by tgf-β. in contrast, tgf-β resistant cell lines expressed high levels of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> mapk. we successfully inhibited p <dig> in ramos cells, and showed that the anti-apoptotic effects of tgf-β is dependent, at least to some degree, on the activity of p <dig>  it is possible that p38-induced sumoylation of smad <dig>  which enhances tgf-β and bmp target gene activation, could explain the positive effect of phosphorylated p <dig> on tgf-β growth inhibition, as suggested by ohshima et al.  <cit> . possibly, one needs to induce erk1/ <dig> in addition to inhibiting p <dig> to diminish the effects of tgf-β. interestingly, we detected phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> in ramos cells, whereas in bl- <dig> and ros- <dig> cells this phosphorylation was not seen. this might explain why the effects of tgf-β were reduced only in ramos cells and not in bl- <dig> and ros- <dig> cells  upon adding the p <dig> inhibitor. phosphorylation of the r-smad linker region may inhibit translocation of activated smad-complexes to the nucleus. it is demonstrated that erk1/ <dig> phosphorylates the linker region of smad <dig> and smad <dig>  and this can inhibit signal transduction and the anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β  <cit> . however, the consequences of linker-phosphorylation remain controversial  <cit> , and we did not detect any higher levels of phosphorylation of the smad <dig> linker region in tgf-β resistant compared to sensitive cell lines. the smad <dig> linker region was phosphorylated in ramos and ros- <dig> cells, and this might even induce smad1/ <dig> signalling by tgf-β in these cells.

id <dig> is a known bmp-responsive gene, which is up-regulated upon smad1/5/ <dig> signalling  <cit> . however, tgf-β-induction of id proteins has previously been found in a bl cell line, ca <dig>  <cit> , although it was not investigated whether smad1/ <dig> signalling was involved. we demonstrate induction of id <dig> protein in the tgf-β sensitive cell lines  after  <dig> h of tgf-β stimulation. opposed to that, daly et al. did not detect induction of a luciferase reporter containing two repeats of a bmp response element in cell types where tgf-β also signals through smad1/ <dig>  <cit> . induction of id <dig> is possibly dependent on the cell type. it has been reported that tgf-β represses id expression in epithelial cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize, three b-cell lymphoma cell lines showed sensitivity to the tgf-β anti-proliferative effects. sensitivity to growth inhibition by tgf-β might depend on smad1/ <dig> signalling in lymphoma cell lines, which possibly initiates via alk- <dig> and terminates in up-regulation of id <dig> and other target genes. we suggest that the regulation of proliferation by tgf-β is at least partly dependent on activated p <dig> mapk. further knock-down studies need to be assessed to confirm this theory. in the future, therapies which can restore sensitivity of lymphoma cells to tgf-β growth control by inducing smad1/ <dig> signalling can be helpful in treatment of b-cell lymphoma patients.
