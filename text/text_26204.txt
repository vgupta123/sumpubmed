BACKGROUND
myrciaria dubia  mcvaugh “camu-camu” is an diploid amazonian plant species with 2n =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  that produces numerous bioactive phytochemicals , but is best known by its high vitamin c  content in fruits  <cit> , which can contain as much as  <dig> g of l-ascorbic acid  per  <dig> g of fruit pulp  <cit> , which is equivalent to  <dig> times the asa content of orange juice  <cit> . pronounced variation in asa content among different tissue types in the same individual and among individuals has been observed  <cit> , but the genetic factors responsible for asa content variation in this species are largely unknown.

results from our research group have demonstrated that m. dubia possesses the capability for asa biosynthesis in several tissues , and that the large variation of this bioactive molecule in the leaves and fruit pulp and peel is likely due, in part, to differential gene expression and enzyme activities in the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway  <cit> . in other plant species, radiolabelling, mutant analysis, and transgenic manipulation have provided evidence for the occurrence of multiple metabolic pathways of asa biosynthesis  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that asa pool size in m. dubia is also the result of multiple metabolic pathways and that their identification and understanding may ultimately explain the large variation observed in asa content.

recent advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics tools have been used successfully to reveal the transcriptome and identify metabolic pathways in several plant species . in this study, we present the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the fruit transcriptome of m. dubia in order to reconstruct metabolic pathways and identify those associated with asa biosynthesis.

RESULTS
illumina paired end sequencing and de novo assembly
a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw sequencing reads of  <dig> bp were generated from a  <dig> bp insert library. after raw reads were filtered and cleaned,  <dig> , <dig>  high-quality reads were used to assemble the fruit transcriptome of m. dubia. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were generated in the meta-assembly with a length between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, mean length of  <dig> bp, and a n <dig> of  <dig> bp . the illumina paired-end reads have been submitted to the short read archive .fig.  <dig> distribution of unigene lengths after de novo transcriptome assembly of fruits from m. dubia




functional annotation, and metabolic pathway assignments
all unigenes were included in the annotation process. this process included best blastx match selection, gene ontology id assignment, enzyme code assignments and interpro domains calculation. blastx comparison with the ncbi nonredundant  database revealed  <dig>   unigenes with annotations . a significant amount of mapping data  was derived from uniprotkb database followed by tair and gr_protein. additional databases  were searched but did not contribute to the mapping process. the top five species that contributed the greatest number of gene annotations from blastx were vitis vinifera, theobroma cacao, populus trichocarpa, prunus persica, and ricinus communis .fig.  <dig> distribution of blast2go three-step processes including blastx, mapping, and annotation of de novo m. dubia fruit transcriptome meta-assembly

of the three core go annotation categories, biological processes  comprised  <dig>  % of the total assigned annotations, whereas cellular components  and molecular functions  comprised  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. the go terms with the largest number of assigned sequences in the bp category were atp binding , zinc ion binding , dna binding , and sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity  . for cc the terms with the most sequences were nucleus , plasma membrane , mitochondrion , and cytosol . in the mf category the terms with the most sequences were oxidation-reduction process , serine family amino acid metabolic process , regulation of transcription, dna-dependent , and protein phosphorylation . in total, kegg maps for more than  <dig> metabolic pathways were generated. the full pathway list and the kegg maps are available as additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  respectively.

l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis and recycling
although the metabolic pathways for asa biosynthesis and recycling are known for several plant species, the existing knowledge of these pathways and enzymes involved in m. dubia are limited. based on the kegg pathway assignment  of the functionally annotated sequences and local blast search of the de novo meta-assembly transcriptome, transcripts coding for the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway were found. this pathway involves the generation of asa from d-mannose-1-phosphate . gdp-d-mannose synthesis from d-mannose-1-phosphate and gtp is catalyzed by gdp-d-mannose pyrophosphorylase , gdp-d-mannose is converted to gdp-l-galactose by a reversible double epimerization, catalyzed by gdp-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase , then gdp-l-galactose is broken down by gdp-l-galactose:hexose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase  to l-galactose-1-phosphate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to l-galactose and inorganic phosphate by l-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase . l-galactose is then oxidized to l-galactono- <dig> -lactone by the nad-dependent l-galactose dehydrogenase , finally l-galactono- <dig> -lactone is oxidized to asa by l-galactono- <dig> -lactone dehydrogenase .fig.  <dig> l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis and recycling pathways reconstructed based on the meta-assembly and annotation of the m. dubia fruit transcriptome



four additional asa biosynthetic pathways were also identified. the first is the animal-like pathway. in this pathway d-glucuronic acid is generated from d-glucose via the intermediates: d-glucose-1-phosphate, udp-d-glucose, udp-d-glucuronic acid, and d-glucuronic acid-1-phosphate. d-glucuronic acid is then converted to l-gulonic acid by glucuronate reductase , which is converted to l-gulono- <dig> -lactone, from this compound asa is generated by l-gulono- <dig> -lactone oxidase/dehydrogenase . the second alternative pathway uses myo-inositol as a precursor of asa. in this pathway, d-glucuronic acid, an intermediate of the animal-like pathway, can be generated from myo-inositol by inositol oxygenase . the third is the l-gulose pathway. in this putative pathway, the first metabolic intermediary  is generated from gdp-d-mannose by action of gdp-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase , subsequently gdp-l-gulose is transformed to l-gulono- <dig> -lactone throughput four sequential biochemical reactions. finally, the fourth is the uronic acid pathway. in this pathway pectin-derived d-galacturonic acid is metabolized to asa by an inversion pathway. the enzyme d-galacturonic acid reductase  reduces the compound d-galacturonic acid to l-galactonic acid, which in turn is spontaneously converted to l-galactono- <dig> -lactone. this compound is the substrate of the l-galactono- <dig> -lactone dehydrogenase enzyme .

we also identified all transcripts coding enzymes involved in the recycling pathway . when asa is oxidized to monodehydroascorbate by ascorbate peroxidase , it can be reduced to asa by monodehydroascorbate reductase  or it can disproportionate non-enzymatically to asa and dehydroascorbate . dha can also be reduced to asa by dehydroascorbate reductase , using glutathione as the reductant  that is then converted to oxidized glutathione . finally, this compound is reduced by glutathione reductase  using nadph as the reductant.

discovery of molecular markers
all unigenes  of the meta-assembly were used to mine potential genic simple sequence repeats  or microsatellites that were defined as di- to hexa-nucleotide motifs with a minimum of five repetitions. a total of  <dig> motifs with simple sequence repeats were identified in  <dig>   unigenes, but  <dig> genic-ssrs were included in unigenes without a match in the nr database . the di-nucleotide repeat ag/tc was the most abundant type , followed by other di-  and tri-nucleotide repeats . the tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats together exhibited the lowest frequency . using primer  <dig> software we were able to design primers for  <dig>  unigenes containing ssrs with product size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp .fig.  <dig> frequency distribution of simple sequence repeats based on motif types identified in the m. dubia fruit transcriptome meta-assembly



a total of  <dig>  putative snps were also discovered, although only  <dig>  met the selection criteria for robustness. the majority of these snps were bi-allelic  and only  <dig> were tri-allelic. these snps were found in  <dig>  unigenes of which  <dig>   could be annotated with a go term . the transition substitutions  were high compared to transversions  with an observed transition over transversion ratio of approximately  <dig> .

several of the genes involved in asa metabolism proved to be polymorphic as evidenced by snp discovery. for example, the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase  contained > <dig> snps, gdp-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase  had  <dig> snps, whereas l-galactono- <dig> -lactone dehydrogenase  only had  <dig> snps. the animal-like pathway utp:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase  contained  <dig> snps. in the uronic acid pathway pectin esterase  and galacturan- <dig> -alpha-galacturonidase  showed more than  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively. finally, in the ascorbate-glutathione pathway the unigenes monodehydroascorbate reductase  and glutathione reductase  contained  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively .

discussion
illumina paired end sequencing and de novo assembly
fruit transcriptome sequencing of m. dubia with illumina paired end sequencing technology and de novo assembly with the meta-assembly bioinformatics strategy were able to produce more than  <dig> million high-quality reads, and ~ <dig>  assembled unigenes with high n <dig> value . similar strategies have been widely utilized for successful de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly of fruits in other plant species such as ananas comosus  <cit> , capsicum annuum  <cit> , litchi chinensis  <cit> , mangifera indica  <cit> , momordica cochinchinensis  <cit> , pyrus bretschneideri  <cit> , and vaccinium spp.  <cit> . additionally, analogous approaches were effectively used for sequencing and de novo assembly of transcriptome in various tissues of several non-model plant species without a reference genome . the novel assembly methods  have made short read assembly to be a cost-effective and reliable tool for gene discovery and molecular markers development in non-model plant species.

functional annotation and metabolic pathway assignments
in the present study we annotated  <dig>  % of the assembled transcriptome, leaving  <dig>  unigenes unidentified. similar results with a large number of unidentified sequences have been reported for other non-model organisms . these unidentified sequences are likely to correspond to non-coding rnas; short sequences lacking informative domains for conclusive annotation; or novel and/or specific genes of m. dubia that have not been previously characterized or coding orphan enzymes . the latter are all sequence-lacking enzymatic activities described in the literature and often catalogued in the ec database  <cit> . according to sorokina et al.  <cit> ,  <dig>  % of enzymatic activities from  <dig>  ecs were orphans, and a large proportion of pathways  contain at least one orphan activity. of the pathways containing a mix of orphan and non-orphan activities in kegg and metacyc, an average of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the reactions per pathway corresponds to orphan enzymes, respectively. consequently, most metabolic pathways are still not entirely resolved at the gene level, which restricts in silico reconstructions of metabolic pathways.

two additional problems that create challenges for automated reconstructions of metabolic pathways are the number of misannotations in large public databases and the variation in metabolic pathways. first, schnoes et al.  <cit>  investigating the prevalence of annotation error in primary and secondary large public protein databases commonly used today, found that the manually curated database swiss-prot shows the lowest annotation error levels. the other two protein sequence databases  and the protein sequences in the kegg pathways database exhibit similar and surprisingly high levels of misannotation that average  <dig> % in the enolase superfamily to over  <dig> % in the had superfamily. second, the availability of sequenced genomes has revealed the diversity of biochemical solutions to similar chemical problems, because the pathway enzymes first discovered in model organisms are often not universally conserved  <cit> . for example, the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis pathway and enzymes are not universal and alternate solutions are found for most steps, making this pathway and others like it a challenge for automatic annotation in many genomes  <cit> .

due to these limitations several metabolic pathways reconstructed from the annotated unigenes of m. dubia show gaps or missing genes. consequently, comparative genomics, enzymatic, metabolomic, and structural analyses will be required to fill these pathway gaps . despite such limitations, it was possible to completely reconstruct several kegg pathways with the m. dubia transcriptome. the well represented pathways discovered in this study included l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis and recycling, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione metabolism, plant pathogen interaction, biosynthesis of plant hormones, aminoacids biosynthesis and degradation, and circadian rhythm . in conclusion, while transcriptomic analysis is not a substitute for detailed gene and pathway studies, it does provide a broad overview of the important metabolic processes from which to efficiently build hypotheses that can guide future detailed studies on improving our understanding of l-ascorbic acid metabolism and the accumulation of other bioactive phytochemicals in this plant species.

l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis and recycling
plants can possess a total of five metabolic pathways for asa biosynthesis. these metabolic pathways are the animal-like pathway  <cit> , the myo-inositol pathway  <cit> , the l-gulose pathway  <cit> , the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway  <cit> , and the uronic acid pathway  <cit> . all these pathways were identified in the fruit transcriptome of m. dubia  and have also been documented in other plant species. for example, analysis of the citrus sinensis fruit transcriptome indicated that genes from four of the five biosynthetic pathways  are expressed  <cit> , whereas expressed sequence tags from fruits and other tissues of four actinidia species  indicated that myo-inositol, d-mannose/l-galactose, and uronic acid are active  <cit> . in contrast, the analysis of fruit transcriptomes of ziziphus jujuba, myrica rubra, and ananas comosus were only able to identify the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway as active  <cit> . from an evolutionary perspective, however, it is possible that many or even most of these metabolic pathways for asa biosynthesis are conserved in plants, because asa is one of the most abundant low molecular weight antioxidant of plants that plays an essential role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. in addition, asa is important in plant development, hormone and light signaling, cell cycle, death, and cell expansion, pathogen responses, and as a cofactor for several key enzymes  <cit> . consequently, the differential activation of one or more, but not all five, metabolic pathways from the above examples via gene expression depends on several factors  and does not necessarily indicate their absence.

the l-gulose pathway is derived from the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway by action of the gdp-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase  and evidence exists that it is active in plant cells, because both l-gulose and l-gulono- <dig> -lactone serve as precursors of l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis  <cit> , but have limited molecular and biochemical studies. to date, genic sequences coding enzymes catalysing four consecutive biochemical reactions are unknown: gdp-l-gulose → l-gulose-1-phosphate → l-gulose → l-gulonic acid → l-gulono- <dig> -lactone  → l-ascorbic acid. except for l-gulono- <dig> -lactone dehydrogenase, enzyme activities for these biochemical reactions also were not tested. enzymatic activity of l-gulono- <dig> -lactone dehydrogenase has been observed in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of the leaves and fruit pulp and peel of m. dubia  <cit>  and tubers of solanum tuberosum  <cit> . in addition, the genome of arabidopsis thaliana contains genes  that are closely related with the rat l-gulono- <dig> -lactone oxidase. some of these genes could be coding enzymes responsible for the conversion of l-gulono- <dig> -lactone to asa  <cit> . also, one putative unigene, probably coding for this enzyme, was identified in our assembled transcriptome .

some of the biochemical reactions of the l-gulose pathway, however, can likely be catalysed from promiscuous enzymes, which is an inherent property of many enzymes catalysing analogous biochemical reactions  <cit> . indeed, some enzymes of the d-mannose/l-galactose pathway catalysing similar reactions of the l-gulose pathway have shown promiscuity. for example, the enzyme gdp-l-galactose:hexose 1-phosphate guanyltransferase  has a low km value , a high turnover rate kcat , and a similar specificity constant kcat/km  with the gdp-l-galactose and gdp-d-glucose substrates, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, the enzyme l-galactose dehydrogenase catalyses the oxidative reduction of both l-galactose and l-gulose substrates in spinacia oleracea  <cit> . consequently, it is necessary to conduct additional research to further our understanding of these genes, enzymes and the contribution of these metabolic pathways to asa biosynthesis and accumulation in fruits, other organs and tissues of m. dubia.

based on the kegg pathway assignments, we identified transcripts coding for all enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione or “foyer-halliwell-asada” pathway . the enzymes of this metabolic pathway have been localized in several compartments of the plant cells, such as the cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and chloroplast  <cit> . this distribution of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway components is attributable to its vital role, since this pathway is recognized to be a key player in h2o <dig> metabolism and asa recycling  <cit> . asa recycling requires a continuous supply of gsh and nadph. the pathways supplying these reductant molecules lie outside of the asa biosynthetic machinery. the key suppliers of gsh are by de novo biosynthesis in two atp-dependent reactions catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase  <cit> . the second biochemical process is catalyzed by glutathione reductase , which uses nadph to reduce gssg to gsh  <cit> . moreover, there are various sources of the essential reductant nadph. the first and principal source is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . the second significant source includes l-malate:nadp oxidoreductase  that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to yield pyruvate, co <dig> and nadph in the presence of a bivalent cation  <cit> . finally, nadph is generated in photosynthetic cells  primarily from the light reactions of photosynthesis  <cit> . therefore, genetic manipulations that increase the availability of gsh and nadph for asa recycling, through up-regulation/over-expression of related genes identified here, could be promising approaches to increase the yield of asa in m. dubia and other plant species.

discovery of molecular markers
it is well-known that genic-ssr markers have numerous applications, such as functional genomics, association mapping, diversity analysis, genome mapping, transferability and comparative mapping, marker assisted selection breeding, and other applications  <cit> . nevertheless, only eight genic-ssr markers have been developed for m. dubia until now  <cit> , limiting the applications previously mentioned. however, with this research mining the assembly fruit transcriptome of m. dubia it was possible to identify a large number of unigenes containing ssr  motifs that would be appropriates for developing a comprehensive set of genic-ssr markers that will need experimental validation. in conclusion, the genic-ssr markers identified in the assembly transcriptome database represent a significant addition to the limited set of markers available in m. dubia and it will be feasible to conduct marker assisted gene mapping for important agronomical traits  or biological processes .

our results regarding genic-ssr markers are largely similar to other plant studies, but differences do exist. first, the percentage of unigenes containing ssrs  is comparable to reports for this species from brazil with  <dig>  %  <cit>  as well as for ipomoea batatas with  <dig>  %  <cit> , cajanus cajan with  <dig>  %  <cit> , capsicum anuum with  <dig>  %  <cit> , and sesamum indicum with  <dig>  %  <cit> . differences, however, existed when compared to apium graveolens with  <dig>  %  <cit>  and the monocot phoenix dactylifera with  <dig>  %  <cit> . second, regarding the distribution of the perfect repeat motif types, tri-nucleotide repeats have generally been observed to have the highest frequency in cereals and other plant species . however, here, as in a previous study on m. dubia  <cit>  and other plant species  <cit> , the most abundant repeat motif type was di-nucleotide repeats, followed by tri-nucleotide repeats. of the thirty motifs, n showed the highest frequency , which is in agreement with other plant species  <cit> . as in monocot  <cit>  and other dicot plants  <cit>  the n motif in m. dubia was the most abundant of the tri-nucleotide repeat motifs. this triplet codes for lysine, which is commonly found in the exons of plants  <cit> . this finding is consistent with katti et al.  <cit>  who showed that expansions of codon repeats corresponding to small hydrophilic amino acids are tolerated more, while strong selection pressures probably eliminate codon repeats encoding for hydrophobic and basic amino acids.

in addition, in our dataset some unigenes containing genic-ssr were lacking functional annotations. these unidentified unigenes probably correspond to untranslated  regions. several researches showed that ssr frequency is high in the 5′ utr regions of plant transcripts , suggesting that ssrs located in this genic region can potentially act as factors in regulating gene expression in the transcriptional or translational levels  <cit> . consequently, these insights are likely to play a significant role in selecting ssrs loci to be used in molecular breeding programs of m. dubia.

sequencing a pool of cdna using next-generation sequencing technologies and appropriate mining software allows for the rapid and inexpensive snp discovery within genes in non-model plants without a reference genome. our transcriptome dataset contained a large number of high quality snps  and marks the highest number of snp markers discovered to date from m. dubia using transcriptome sequencing. while the majority of snps were bi-allelic , an insignificant fraction showed tri-allelic  polymorphisms. these results are in agreement with the diploid nature of the m. dubia genome  <cit> . similar low levels of tri-allelic snps also were reported in other plant species such as brassica napus with  <dig> – <dig>  %  <cit>  and manihot esculenta with  <dig>  %  <cit> , whereas tri-allelic snps were not detected in sesamum indicum  <cit>  and hevea brasiliensis  <cit> . nevertheless, the switchgrass panicum virgatum possesses a substancial number of tri-allelic snps , which is consistent with the polyploid condition of the genome of this species  <cit> . although in principle, at each position of a sequence any of the four nucleotide bases can be present, however, snps are frequently biallelic. one possible explanation is the low frequency of single nucleotide substitutions  at the nuclear genes of plants  <cit> . consequently, the probability of two or three independent mutations occurring at a single position is very low. another important cause for the prevalence of bi-allelic snp is attributable to a clear bias in the mutation mechanism that results in a prevalence of transitions over transversions exchanges . one probable explanation for this is the high frequency of spontaneous deamination of 5-methyl cytosine to thymidine in the cpg dinucleotides  <cit> .

although snps are less polymorphic than ssr markers, they easily compensate for this drawback by being abundant and amenable to high- and ultra-high-throughput automation  <cit> . consequently, this large collection of snp markers could facilitate genetic applications in m. dubia such as genetic diversity and characterization, linkage mapping, high-density quantitative trait locus analysis, association studies, map-based cloning, marker-assisted plant breeding, and functional genomics.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the first next-generation sequencing effort and transcriptome annotation of a non-model amazonian plant that is relevant for asa production and other bioactive phytochemicals. genes encoding key enzymes were successfully identified and metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis of asa, anthocyanins, and other metabolic pathways have been reconstructed. the identification of these genes and pathways is in agreement with the empirically observed capability of m. dubia to synthesize and accumulate asa and other important molecules, and adds to our current knowledge of the molecular biology and biochemistry of their production in plants. by providing insights into the mechanisms underpinning these metabolic processes, these results can be used to direct efforts to genetically manipulate this organism in order to enhance the production of these bioactive phytochemicals.

the accumulation of asa precursor and discovery of genes associated with their biosynthesis and metabolism in m. dubia is intriguing and worthy of further investigation. the sequences and pathways produced here present the genetic framework required for further studies. quantitative transcriptomics in concert with studies of the genome, proteome, and metabolome under conditions that stimulate production and accumulation of asa and their precursors are needed to provide a more comprehensive view of how these pathways for asa metabolism are regulated and linked in this species.
