BACKGROUND
transporter proteins play important roles in absorption and elimination of numerous endogenous molecules, as well as exogenous substances and their metabolites, from cells. moreover, identification and characterization of transporter proteins are important for drug discovery and development
 <cit> . the mechanisms involved in cellular transport of organic anions and cations have been studied and reviewed elsewhere
 <cit> . transporter proteins belong to two major superfamilies: solute carrier  and atp-binding cassette 
 <cit> . the slc transporters include two families consisting of the organic anion transporting polypeptides  and the slc22a group, which contains the organic cation transporters  and the organic anion transporters 
 <cit> . in general, transporters are designed to recognize a single substance or a group of very similar substances, although some carrier proteins such as oatps show broad substrate specificities
 <cit> .

recently, organic solute carrier protein  <dig>  was identified in mammals as a polyspecific solute carrier protein
 <cit>  and likely novel member of the slc transporters. when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes, oscp <dig> mediated high affinity transport of p-aminohippurate , tetraethylammonium, and a wide range of structurally diverse organic compounds including prostagladin e <dig>  prostaglandin f2α, estron sulfate, glutarate, l-leucine, l-ascorbic acid and tetracycline
 <cit> . these results suggest that oscp <dig> mediates transport of various organic solutes into cells.

on the other hand the oscp <dig> gene, also named as oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein  <dig> , has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently down-expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinomas 
 <cit> . moreover, the oscp <dig>  promoter region has been found to be frequently methylated in acute myeloid leukemia  patients
 <cit> . these data indicate that oscp <dig> may play a role in genesis of npc and aml, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

most slc22a super family proteins are predicted to consist of  <dig> transmembrane domains, with intracellular amino and carboxy-termini
 <cit> , although organic solute transporter alpha  and beta  contain  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane domains, respectively
 <cit> . however, the structure of oscp <dig> has not yet been biochemically and physically characterized. in the present study, we therefore examined the structure of drosophila melanogaster oscp <dig> . native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with and without β-mercaptoethanol treatment revealed that the recombinant doscp <dig> forms dimers and trimers in solution. the dimer form of doscp <dig> was further confirmed by western immunoblot analyses with third instar larval extracts.

subcellular localization of oscp <dig> is controversial. although it has been reported to localize in plasma membranes of human trophoblast cells and mouse sertoli cells
 <cit> , cytoplasmic localization has also been reported in mouse cerebral neuronal cells
 <cit>  and human hela cells
 <cit> . therefore, in this study, we examined subcellular localization of doscp <dig> and revealed its presence in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, mitochondria and nucleus of cells. the data indicate that doscp <dig> plays not only in the transport of organic solutes through the cell membrane, but also into the organelles and nucleus, and consequently it may be involved in regulation of apoptosis, differentiation and/or proliferation.

RESULTS
oscp <dig> is an evolutionary conserved protein across species
we used the ncbi database  to access information on oscp <dig>  the data showed that the oscp <dig> gene is conserved among multiple species such as h.sapiens, p.troglodytes, m.mulatta, m.musculus, c.lupus, b.taurus, g.gallus, r.norvegicus, d.rerio, c.elegans and d.melanogaster, but not in s.cerevisiae. to gain insight into the relationships of the oscp <dig> among individual species, sequence alignments were analyzed by clustalw <dig> software. identical amino acid residues are shaded in black and similar amino acid residues are in gray in figure 
 <dig>  and the highly conserved regions  <dig> and  <dig> are underlined. the similarity and identity of amino acid sequences of human oscp <dig>  and drosophila  were found to be 58% and 30%, respectively. the most highly conserved region  <dig> of hoscp <dig> and doscp <dig>  showed 92% similarity and 48% identity. the highly conserved region  <dig> of these two proteins  showed 100% similarity and 57% identity. these two conserved regions may thus play important roles in oscp <dig> function, although further analyses are necessary to clarify this point.

expression and purification of recombinant doscp <dig> protein
the expression plasmid pcold-doscp <dig> and empty vector pcoldi were transformed into the e. coli bl <dig> strain. expression of the recombinant his-doscp <dig> fusion protein was induced by adding  <dig>  mm iptg at 18°c for 15 hours. most recombinant protein was found in the soluble fraction  and ni-nta method was used to purify the his-doscp <dig> fusion protein for analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . this latter detected a single 35 kda band on coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig>  staining . the doscp <dig> protein contains  <dig> amino acids and the calculated molecular weight is  <dig> , that is nearly identical in size to the detected band. the purity of the recombinant doscp <dig> in the final fraction was estimated to be more than 95%. western immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-his antibody showed the 35 kda band to truly represent the his-doscp <dig> .

structural analysis of doscp <dig> by native page
to evaluate the possible multimer formation of doscp <dig>  we performed native-page analysis of recombinant doscp <dig> protein, treated with or without 4% sds and 10% β-mercaptoethanol with or without heating. the apparent dimer form of doscp <dig> was detected at the position corresponding to 70 kda when compared with the standard maker . in addition a more slowly migrating band corresponding to 100 kda was also detected that could represent a trimer form of doscp <dig> under the native page conditions. in any event, by this method, we first established that doscp <dig> can form multimers in solution.

western immunoblot analysis with canton s third instar larval extracts using anti-doscp <dig> antibody revealed a 35 kda doscp <dig> band . the intensity of this was decreased by 40% in extracts of eye discs in which doscp <dig> double stranded rna  was specifically expressed with gmr-gal <dig> and uas-doscp1ir . the results thus indicated that the 35 kda band truly represents the doscp <dig> protein. the faint 70 kda band for the putative dimer form of doscp <dig> was also detected even under denaturing conditions with 4% sds and 10% β-mercaptoethanol , suggesting that doscp <dig> forms dimers in vivo. dimer or multimer formation in the presence of sds has been reported for drosophila β-sarcoglycan
 <cit>  and mammalian sarcoglycans
 <cit> . it has also been reported that some cell surface antigens such as hla-dr, -dc <dig> and –b <dig> form dimeric or multimeric forms even with sds-page
 <cit> .

subcellular localization of doscp <dig> protein in various drosophila larval tissues
the goal of our study was molecular, structural, and functional characterization of doscp <dig> protein localized in cells. as a first step towards this goal, the anti-doscp <dig> antibody was used to examine the expression pattern of the doscp <dig> protein in various tissues in the third instar larvae of drosophila. immunostaining results showed doscp <dig> to be expressed ubiquitously in various tissues including brain lobes, leg discs, wing discs, eye discs, fat bodies  and salivary glands . no signals were detected with the primary doscp <dig> antibody preincubated with the purified his-doscp <dig> fusion protein , indicating specificity for the oscp <dig> protein. immunohistochemical results showed that doscp <dig> signals were mainly detectable in the cytoplasm as dotted or mesh-like structures . salivary glands showed strong doscp <dig> signals in the cell membrane and in a cytoplasmic mesh-like structure . in the proximal regions of the glands, significant signals of doscp <dig> were also detected in the nucleus . in contrast, no nuclear signals were detectable in the distal region .to further evaluate the signals with anti-doscp <dig> antibody, a flip-out experiment was employed to make a somatic clone expressing doscp <dig> dsrna in the salivary glands. in rnai clones marked with gfp, the level of doscp <dig> signals was specifically reduced , thus confirming that the anti-doscp <dig> signals both in the cytoplasm and nucleus truly represent doscp <dig> protein.

localization of doscp <dig> protein on plasma membranes
to confirm the localization of doscp <dig> in the cell membrane, we performed double-immunostaining assay with anti-doscp <dig> antibody and anti-discs large  antibody. dlg has been reported as a component of septate junction structures in drosophila epithelia cells
 <cit> . anti-dlg antibody labels cell membranes and was therefore used here as a marker. immunostaining showed signals with the anti-doscp <dig> antibody to overlap those with the anti-dlg antibody .

localization of doscp <dig> protein in subcellular organelles
in immunostaining with salivary gland, we observed doscp <dig> signals in a mesh-like structure in the cytoplasm . as a first step to clarify the nature of this doscp1-positive structure, regarding the precise localization of the oscp <dig> protein in the cytoplasm, double-immunostaining of the salivary gland with anti-doscp <dig> and specific antibodies for each organelle was performed.

to investigate the localization of doscp <dig> in the endoplasmic reticulum , we used anti-doscp <dig> antibody and anti-kdel antibody for double immunostaining of the third instar larval salivary gland. the anti-kdel antibody has been used as the er marker
 <cit>  which labels the sequence lys-asp-glu-leu , or a closely related sequence, that is present at the carboxyl terminus of er soluble and some membrane proteins
 <cit> . double-immunostaining showed co-localization of doscp <dig> and kdel signals . it is reported that in the salivary gland, kdel signals are detectable not only in er but also in cell and nuclear membranes
 <cit> . this staining pattern with the anti-kdel antibody appears to be intrinsic to this highly secreting tissue, since immunostaining of the cultured s <dig> cells with the same antibody showed signals in er without any detectable signals in cell and nuclear membranes . these results indicate that doscp <dig> localizes in er.

to examine the localization of doscp <dig> in the golgi apparatus, we employed double labeling with anti-doscp <dig> and anti-kdel receptor antibodies. kdel receptor is an integral membrane protein which mediates the retrieval of solute resident proteins from golgi apparatus to the er
 <cit> . some signals with anti-kdel receptor in cell and nuclear membranes in addition to golgi apparatus observed in this analysis are also reported with the salivary gland
 <cit> . the results showed co-localization of doscp <dig> and kdel receptor signals .

to further evaluate the golgi apparatus localization of doscp <dig>  double immunostaining with anti-doscp <dig> and anti-gm <dig> antibodies was performed. the anti-gm <dig> antibody detects a peripheral membrane protein gm <dig> that binds to the golgi complex
 <cit> . the data showed overlapping signals , further confirming the golgi apparatus localization of doscp <dig> 

in addition, localization of doscp <dig> in mitochondria was examined. to test this, the mitochondria protein hsp60
 <cit>  was labeled with anti-hsp <dig> antibody. double immunostaining with anti-doscp <dig> and anti-hsp <dig> antibodies showed the co-localization in cytoplasmic dots . thus a mitochondrial localization of doscp <dig> was also demonstrated.

discussion
oscp <dig> has been reported to mediate the transport of various organic solutes such as organic anions and cations across the plasma membrane in a ph-dependent and sodium-independent manner
 <cit> . however, the underlying mechanisms of oscp <dig> function have been unclear. up to now, there has been no report on the structure of oscp <dig> protein. previous studies demonstrated that oligomerization of many transporter proteins plays an important role in movement of materials across cells
 <cit> . thus, oligomerization allows proteins to form large structures without increasing genome size and provides stability, while the reduced surface area of monomers in a complex can offer protection against denaturation
 <cit> . moreover, many proteins are known to self-assemble into oligomers to perform their biological functions
 <cit> . in this study we found that doscp <dig> could form dimers and trimers in solution, which may be required for its transporter functions. regarding membrane transporter proteins, dimerization and higher order oligomerization have actually been proposed as important factors that modulate their activity
 <cit> . therefore, further investigation of the dimerization of doscp <dig> would appear necessary to ascertain the underlying mechanisms of function.

in addition, several membrane transporters such as oats are predicted to have a  <dig> membrane spanning domain
 <cit> , while the exceptions of ostα and ostβ predicted to have seven and one, respectively
 <cit> . we used bioinformatics tools to gain insight into whether or not drosophila oscp <dig> carries a potential transmembrane domain. however, kyte-doolittle hydropathy analysis method indicated that drosophila oscp <dig> carries no potential transmembrane domain . the same prediction was obtained with the smart program  and the tmpred program . furthermore, a previous study predicted that mouse oscp <dig> does not carry any potential transmembrane domain
 <cit> . these observations indicate that doscp <dig> may be not imbedded in the membrane but associated with some membrane bound proteins and consequently indirectly mediate and facilitate the transport of organic solutes into the cells. it is well established that many proteins associated with the cell membrane are either directly or indirectly involved in membrane transport
 <cit> . multimeric complex formation was also reported for l-type amino acid transporter  <dig> with the 4ef <dig> heavy chain
 <cit> , and between ostα and ostβ
 <cit> . taken together these observations suggest that doscp <dig> may associate with other transporters to assist their functions. future investigations should focus on whether oscp <dig> acts as a regulator or a constituent of the functional transporter system in cells.

various membrane transporters have been detected in different tissues including the blood–brain barrier, lung, heart, intestine and kidney
 <cit> . the broad tissue distribution of human, mouse and rat oscp <dig> has been well characterized, brain, lung, trachea, spinal chord and nasopharynx being included as shared sites
 <cit> . therefore, the present detection of doscp <dig> in various drosophila larval tissues including brain lobes, eye discs, wing discs, leg discs, fat body and salivary glands suggests that the broad distribution pattern of oscp <dig> is conserved among multiple species.

in addition to the dotted or mesh-like structures of doscp <dig> signals in the cytoplasm of the salivary glands, we detected some nuclear doscp <dig> signals in the proximal regions of the glands. in contrast, no nuclear signal was detectable in the distal region. it is known that most of cells in salivary glands of late stage of third instar larvae have completed polytenization in the distal region, but not in the proximal region
 <cit> . therefore doscp <dig> may play a role in nuclei of endoreplicating cells. although doscp <dig> does not contain a canonical nuclear localization signal , the psort ii tool based on the amino acid sequence predicts nuclear localization of doscp <dig> with  <dig> % reliability . however, since we cannot exclude the possibility that the antibody may be more accessible to the proximal region, further analyses are necessary to confirm these observations.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we could show that doscp <dig> localizes not only in the plasma membrane but also in the nucleus, er, golgi apparatus and mitochondria. it is therefore conceivable that this protein may interact with various partners or form multimeric complexes with other proteins to play multiple roles in cells. whatever the case, the present data should help in furthering understanding of the roles of the doscp <dig> gene during drosophila development.
