BACKGROUND
the metacestode stage of the fox-tapeworm echinococcus multilocularis is the causative agent of alveolar echinococcosis , one of the most serious parasitic diseases in the northern hemisphere  <cit> . initial infection of the intermediate host  occurs through oral uptake of infectious eggs that contain the oncosphere. upon hatching from the egg within the intermediate host’s intestine, the oncosphere penetrates the intestinal wall and gains access to the inner organs. almost exclusively within the liver, the oncosphere then undergoes a metamorphic transition towards the metacestode that is driven by parasite stem cells  <cit> . once formed as small cystic structures, the metacestode tissue proliferates and infiltrates host tissue like a malignant tumour, eventually giving rise to numerous protoscoleces that either develop into the strobilar adult stage, when transmitted to the definitive host, or ‘re-differentiate’ towards the metacestode, when distributed in the intermediate host see additional file  <dig> <cit> .

all larval developmental transitions of e. multilocularis as well as proliferation of metacestode tissue take place in close contact with the intermediate host’s endocrine and paracrine systems, which involve numerous evolutionarily conserved hormones, such as insulin or cytokines of the epidermal growth factor  and the transforming growth factor-β  families. since the parasite expresses respective surface receptor kinases it has already been suggested that the host-parasite interplay in ae might rely on hormonal host-parasite cross communication  <cit> , although little information on the underlying interaction mechanisms is currently available. of particular interest in the case of e. multilocularis are possible effects of host-derived insulin since, in mammalian hosts, the highest concentrations of this hormone can be found at the junction between the portal vein and the liver parenchyma  <cit> , which is also the liver entry site of the oncosphere  <cit> .

due to its important role in regulating a variety of metabolic and developmental processes, insulin signalling has been well studied in mammals and invertebrate model systems, such as caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster <cit> . insulin signalling is initiated by binding of insulin-like hormones to surface receptor tyrosine kinases of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor  family that are usually produced as long pro-peptides which are later processed into an extracellular α-subunit and a membrane-spanning β-subunit, connected by a disulphide bridge  <cit> . upon ligand binding to surface associated α2β <dig> receptor tetramers, auto-phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues within the β-subunit is induced, one of which forms part of a well conserved npxy-motif that is located in the juxta-membrane region  <cit> . downstream signalling is then induced by binding of intracellular adapter proteins  to the phosphorylated npxy motif. the two major downstream signalling pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates are the erk1/ <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase /protein kinase b  pathway  <cit> .

insulin signalling mechanisms have already been studied to a certain extent in parasitic and free-living flatworms. tyrosine kinases of the insulin receptor family have been fully characterized in the cestode e. multilocularis <cit>  and the trematodes schistosoma mansoni <cit>  and s. japonicum <cit> . using the yeast two-hybrid system it was further shown that the ligand binding domains  of the flatworm insulin receptor tyrosine kinases are principally able to bind human insulin  <cit> , although it is not yet clear whether they are also activated by insulin when expressed at the parasite surface. reduced glucose uptake in in vitro cultivated schistosomes upon treatment with insulin receptor inhibitors indicated that, at least in trematodes, insulin signalling might regulate glucose homeostasis  <cit> . several investigations on the direct influence of host insulin on flatworm parasite glucose uptake and/or development showed slight effects and were carried out using un-physiologically high concentrations of the host hormone  <cit> . finally, a very recent study in the free-living model system schmidtea mediterranea demonstrated a role of insulin signalling in the regulation of flatworm stem cell activity and proliferation  <cit> .

during recent years, we have developed several cultivation systems by which the developmental transitions of e. multilocularis larvae within the intermediate host can be mimicked in vitro <cit> . these include systems for investigating proliferation and differentiation of metacestode vesicles under host cell free conditions  <cit>  as well as a parasite stem cell cultivation system that closely mimics the metamorphic transition of the oncosphere towards the metacestode  <cit> . using these systems we addressed, in the present study, questions on the influence of physiological concentrations of human insulin on parasite development, glucose uptake and the activation of echinococcus insulin signalling pathways. we demonstrate that e. multilocularis larval development is significantly stimulated in the presence of physiological concentrations of human insulin, and that the parasite’s insulin signalling pathways are activated upon exogenous addition of insulin. we also show that the e. multilocularis insulin signalling pathways are affected by an insulin receptor inhibitor originally designed against the human insulin receptor and that this treatment results in impaired larval development and parasite killing.

RESULTS
host insulin stimulates e. multilocularis larval development in vitro
to study the influence of human insulin on parasite development, three different in vitro cultivation systems were used. first, we studied the effect of insulin on isolated e. multilocularis primary cells that contain high numbers of totipotent stem cells, which lead to the formation of metacestode vesicles in a manner that closely resembles the oncosphere-metacestode transition during the early phase of in vivo infections  <cit> . as depicted in figure 1a, parasite cell aggregates that result from stem cell proliferation  <cit>  were always larger in insulin treated samples and, when compared to the control, also contained larger internal cavities which later gave rise to mature vesicles. the formation of mature vesicles was also significantly stimulated and approximately three-fold and six-fold more vesicles were detected after one week incubation in the presence of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm insulin, respectively . although insulin-treated samples consistently yielded higher numbers of mature metacestode vesicles, the eventually obtained vesicle size in these samples was not significantly enlarged when compared to the controls . as displayed in figure 1c, insulin-treatment also significantly stimulated the uptake of bromodeoxyuridine  in parasite primary cell cultures, indicating that the host hormone has a direct effect on the proliferation rate of parasite stem cells, which are the only cells capable of proliferation in flatworms  <cit> .

we next tested the effects of host insulin on the development of mature metacestode vesicles. although insulin-treatment showed a clear trend to yield larger vesicles after about two weeks of incubation , measurement of parasite development on the basis of vesicle volume increase is difficult in this system. we, therefore, mainly tested stem cell proliferation and, as shown in figure 1d, insulin treatment significantly stimulated brdu uptake in metacestode vesicles, although not as prominently as in the case of primary stem cell cultures.

protoscoleces of the closely related dog-tapeworm e. granulosus show the unique capacity of being able to mature into strobilar adult stages, when ingested by a definitive canid host, but also of ‘re-differentiating’ into fully developed cysts when released into the intermediate host body cavity upon cyst rupture  <cit> . this capacity appears to be also shared by protoscoleces of e. multilocularis <cit> . to investigate the effects of host insulin on the echinococcus re-differentiation processes, we employed a cultivation system in which e. multilocularis protoscoleces were kept in the presence of hepatocyte-conditioned medium that usually induces vesicle formation from parasite stem cells  <cit> . as shown in figure 1e, e. multilocularis protoscoleces did indeed re-differentiate into fully mature metacestode vesicles under these conditions, although the number of protoscoleces that underwent re-differentiation was usually very low . in the presence of  <dig> nm or  <dig> nm insulin, however, the number of fully re-differentiated protoscoleces was significantly increased by around 50% .

taken together, these results indicated that e. multilocularis stem cell cultures and larvae are responsive to physiologically relevant concentrations of host insulin and that this treatment stimulates the formation of metacestode vesicles either from stem cell cultures or from protoscoleces.

characterization of e. multilocularis insulin-receptors
we had previously characterized an insulin-like receptor tyrosine kinase of e. multilocularis, originally designated emir, which at least in the yeast two-hybrid system interacted with human pro-insulin  <cit> . when analysing the recently released whole genome sequence of e. multilocularis <cit>  the respective gene, emir, was identified on scaffold  <dig>  and comprised  <dig> exons, separated by  <dig> introns, as previously determined  <cit> . in extensive basic local alignment search tool  analyses using the amino acid sequences of the human insulin receptor , emir, and previously described insulin receptors from schistosomes  <cit> , we found a second gene on the e. multilocularis genome that obviously encoded another receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor family. the respective gene was designated emir <dig>  and the previously identified gene, emir, was re-named to emir <dig>  the entire emir <dig> cdna was cloned and sequenced and found to encode a protein, emir <dig>  of  <dig>  amino acids . in simple modular architecture research tool  homology analyses, emir <dig> displayed a domain structure typical of insulin receptor tyrosine kinases, with a predicted signal peptide, a lbd composed of two receptor l domains separated by a furin domain, three fibronectin  <dig> domains, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain  . particularly within the tkd and the lbd, emir <dig> showed significant amino acid sequence homologies to emir <dig> and insulin receptors of mammalian and schistosome origin . interestingly, and in contrast to emir <dig>  emir <dig> did not contain a npxy motif in the juxtamembrane region which, in hir, is important for downstream signalling through irs  <cit>  .

we considered both emir <dig> and emir <dig> likely candidates for mediating the effects of host insulin on the parasite larval stages and, thus, analysed the role of these kinases in echinococcus insulin signalling in more detail. first, we carried out semi-quantitative rt-pcr experiments to analyse the expression patterns of the echinococcus insulin receptor genes in different larval stages. as shown in figure 3a, emir <dig> and emir <dig> expression was detected in all larval stages that were responsive to host insulin. we also analysed the expression levels of both genes in available transcriptome data sets that were generated for gene annotation of the e. multilocularis genome project  <cit> . according to these data, emir <dig> is about two- to three-fold higher expressed in echinococcus larvae than emir <dig>  and both genes show the lowest expression levels in adult worms . for biochemical and histochemical investigations, we next produced specific antisera directed against the intracellular portions of emir <dig> and emir <dig> . as shown in figure 3b, the anti-emir <dig> antiserum detected a band of approximately 150 kda, the intensity of which increased upon treatment of parasite lysate with β-mercaptoethanol, as well as several larger bands around 195 kda. this pattern indicated that the 150 kda band represents the emir <dig> β-subunit, whereas the 195 kda band are most likely αβ-subunit dimers that are still connected by disulphide bridges. the actual molecular mass of the emir <dig> β-subunit is higher than the calculated mass of the polypeptide , which is most probably due to post-translational modification, such as glycosylation, as has already been shown for insulin receptor β-subunits of other organisms, including the human insulin receptor  <cit> . in the case of emir <dig>  an intense band of 87 kda was observed when immunoprecipitates were treated with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, indicating that this is the emir <dig> β-subunit, whereas in the presence of 1% β-mercaptoethanol one large band was visible that, due to its size of >230 kda, could represent an α2β <dig> tetramer. when total parasite lysate was probed with the anti-emir <dig> antiserum, a smaller band of approximately 60 kda was detected alongside the 87 kda band, which could be due to alternative processing of the emir <dig> β-subunit .

interestingly, when we analysed the e. multilocularis larval stages for the presence of emir <dig> in western blot experiments, clear signals were obtained for protoscoleces and metacestode vesicles but no signal was obtained for primary cell cultures . in the case of emir <dig>  on the other hand, signals were obtained for protoscoleces and primary cells, but only a very faint signal was seen in metacestode preparations . since rt-pcr and transcriptome data revealed the presence of emir <dig> transcripts in primary cell cultures and emir <dig> transcripts in metacestode vesicles , these results were unexpected and indicated that the expression of emir <dig> and emir <dig> in primary cell cultures and metacestode vesicles, respectively, might be subject to translational repression.

using the anti-emir <dig> antiserum, we next investigated the localization of emir <dig> in echinococcus larval stages by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. as expected from the western blot experiments mentioned above, no emir <dig> staining was obtained for primary cell cultures . most strikingly, however, we observed particularly strong staining for a population of large, round cells present at the proximal layer of the metacestode . these cells clearly represented the parasite’s glycogen storing cells , in which glycogen is not preserved when fixed without tannic acid. these results could be verified by transmission electron microscopy using immune-gold labelled anti-emir <dig> antiserum. again, strong signals were obtained for gsc , but weaker signals associated with other cell types, such as undifferentiated parasite stem cells, were also observed . for emir <dig>  staining of the parenchyma close to the surface of the protoscolex was obtained as well as a diffuse staining pattern throughout primary cell aggregates . for metacestode vesicles, on the other hand, no emir <dig> signal was obtained .

using an established protocol applicable to metacestode vesicles, we also investigated emir <dig> expression by in situ hybridisation. in these experiments, no signal was obtained for the germinal layer of vesicles that had not yet started to develop protoscoleces . however, in fertile vesicles an intense emir <dig> signal was associated with the proliferation zone of developing protoscoleces, in which parasite stem cells undergo cell division, as indicated by the incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-ethylnyl-2’-deoxyuridine  . these data indicated that emir <dig> might be specifically expressed in parasite stem cells or, at least, in parasite tissues that are actively proliferating.

taken together these results demonstrated that emir <dig> is present in metacestode vesicles where it is primarily associated with gsc. since host insulin is present not only outside of metacestode vesicles but highly likely also within hydatid fluid, which contains a large number of host serum proteins  <cit> , the localisation of emir <dig> also suggests that it has direct contact with host insulin. emir <dig>  on the other hand, was not present in metacestode vesicles , but dispersed throughout primary cell aggregates. furthermore, emir <dig> expression was prominent in developing protoscoleces which suggests an association with parasite stem cells.

host insulin stimulates glucose uptake by metacestode vesicles
the prominent localisation of emir <dig> in gsc indicated that this receptor could be involved in echinococcus glucose uptake/storage mechanisms. to investigate this aspect, metacestode vesicles were cultivated in the presence of radioactively labelled glucose and were either stimulated with host insulin or not. as shown in figure  <dig>  the addition of  <dig> nm insulin to metacestode vesicles significantly stimulated glucose uptake after one hour of incubation, which was even more pronounced after addition of the phosphatase inhibitor na3vo <dig>  indicating that phosphorylation events are involved in regulating echinococcus glucose uptake or transport. hence, similar to the situation in intermediate host hepatocytes, insulin also regulates glucose uptake by parasite cells.

host insulin affects parasite signalling pathways
next, we investigated parasite signalling pathways that could be involved in insulin sensing and signalling. first, we concentrated on emir <dig>  which showed prominent expression in gsc of metacestode vesicles. the membrane fraction of metacestode vesicles was isolated and the presence of emir <dig> in this fraction was verified by western blotting . the proteins in the membrane fraction were then stimulated with human insulin for 30 minutes in the presence of - γatp. as a control, human igf was tested which, unlike insulin, has previously been shown not to interact with the emir <dig> lbd in yeast two-hybrid experiments  <cit> . after stimulation, emir <dig> was immunoprecipitated from the membrane fraction and phosphorylation was analysed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography . in order to ensure maximal activation of the receptor in this complex immunoprecipitation experiment, saturating hormone concentrations of  <dig> nm were used, as usual for comparable experiments on insulin receptors  <cit> . as depicted in figure 9b, emir <dig> protein phosphorylation was detected after stimulation with insulin, but not with igf. protein bands smaller than the expected size of the emir <dig> β-subunit  were most probably due to degradation of membrane proteins in this experimental setting.

we also employed a specific compound, hnmpa <dig>  that was originally designed to inhibit the human insulin receptor  <cit>  and was subsequently found to also inhibit schistosome insulin receptors  <cit> . to confirm that hnmpa <dig> is principally also able to inhibit emir <dig>  in silico modelling of the emir <dig> tkd was carried out and revealed that hnmpa <dig> has comparable affinities for the emir <dig> tkd and the hir tkd . interestingly, when stimulated by insulin in the presence of 100 μm hnmpa <dig>  no phosphorylation of emir <dig> immunoprecipitates was observed , indicating that this compound prevents emir <dig> activation.

we also investigated specific tyrosine phosphorylation of emir <dig> after insulin treatment of metacestode vesicles. to this end, intact in vitro cultivated metacestode vesicles were stimulated with  <dig> nm insulin  for 10 minutes, followed by immunoprecipitation of emir <dig>  using the anti-emir <dig> antiserum. subsequently, detection of phosphorylated tyrosine using an anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody was carried out. as shown in figure 9c, insulin treatment indeed induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the emir <dig> β-subunit in these vesicles.

in other organisms, signalling pathways that act downstream of insulin receptors usually involve phosphorylation of several intracellular signalling factors. among the signalling pathways that are stimulated by insulin in many organisms is the erk-like mapk cascade  <cit> , a complete module of which we had previously characterized in e. multilocularis <cit> . when we analysed the activation of the echinococcus mapk cascade in response to exogenously added insulin by measuring phosphorylation of the erk-like mapk emmpk <dig>  <cit> , however, only a very weak induction was observed . we, therefore, concentrated in additional experiments on the pi3k/akt-pathway, another major downstream target of insulin signalling in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . so far, this pathway had not been addressed in echinococcus or other parasitic helminths. we, therefore, first screened the available e. multilocularis genome sequence  <cit>  and could indeed identify genes encoding several key components of this pathway, such as a catalytic subunit of pi3k, an ortholog to mtor , a glycogen synthase kinase-ortholog, and orthologs to protein kinase b  or the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein  . we were particularly interested in the genes encoding the e. multilocularis orthologs of akt  and 4e-bp  and fully cloned and sequenced the respective cdnas. next, we used antibodies that either detect the phosphorylated form of the evolutionarily conserved akt kinase target motif rxrxxs/t or the phosphorylated form of 4e-bp in a region that is highly conserved among orthologs of different species  to study the effects of insulin on the pi3k/akt pathway. as depicted in figure 9d, some basic level of phosphorylation was detected both for akt substrates and 4e-bp, which is most probably due to the fact that serum-containing media inevitably contain residual concentrations of insulin, which cannot be completely removed. however, particularly after a five minute treatment of metacestode vesicles with  <dig> nm exogenous insulin, a marked phosphorylation of several additional proteins could be observed using the anti-phospho-akt-substrate antibody. furthermore, using the anti-phospho-4e-bp antibody, a clearly enhanced phosphorylation of a single protein with a molecular mass within the range of 4e-bps was detected. we then also investigated whether 4e-bp phosphorylation in response to insulin can be inhibited by hnmpa <dig>  and found that this was indeed the case .

taken together, these results indicated that exogenously added insulin directly stimulated emir <dig> in intact metacestode vesicles and that insulin treatment also led to an activation of the pi3k/akt-pathway in echinococcus.

an insulin receptor inhibitor blocks parasite development in vitro
since the insulin receptor inhibitor hnmpa <dig> prevented the phosphorylation of emir <dig> in metacestode membrane fractions , we further investigated the effects of this small molecule compound on parasite development. first, we investigated larval development from stem cell cultures to metacestode vesicles and observed that vesicle formation was almost completely abolished at concentrations of  <dig> and 50 μm of hnmpa <dig> . these concentrations also significantly decreased protoscolex viability , but were ineffective in killing metacestode vesicles, at least after seven days of incubation . in the presence of 100 μm hnmpa <dig>  on the other hand, only 20% of metacestode vesicles survived after seven days . taken together, these data indicated that intact insulin receptor signalling is important for parasite survival and development.

characterization of insulin-like peptides in e. multilocularis
as yet, the presence of genes that encode insulin-like peptides has been described for the free-living flatworm s. mediterranea <cit>  but not in any parasitic flatworm. we, therefore, screened the e. multilocularis genome  <cit>  by blast analyses for the presence of such genes. indeed, we found two genes located immediately adjacent to each other  on contig  <dig> of the current assembly, which code for peptides with moderate overall homology to human insulin, but which display classical signatures of insulin-like peptides  . both genes, named emilp <dig>  and emilp <dig> , code for peptides that, according to smart analyses, contain an iigf domain  and an export-directing signal peptide , indicating that they are secreted. by rt-pcr analyses it was very difficult to amplify emilp <dig> and emilp <dig> transcripts from rna preparations of primary cells, metacestode vesicles and protoscoleces , indicating that both genes are very slightly expressed in parasite larval stages. accordingly, in available transcriptome data sets for e. multilocularis <cit> , emilp <dig> and emilp <dig> show highest expression levels in the adult stage , whereas only moderate expression was found for emilp <dig> in parasite larvae and no expression of emilp <dig> in primary cells and metacestode vesicles .

the interaction between ilps and cognate receptors has previously been investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit>  and we employed this approach to also study interactions between human insulin, the parasite ilps and possible cognate receptors. as shown in figure 11b, human pro-insulin interacted strongly with the lbd of hir and both parasite insulin receptors. emilp <dig> and emilp <dig>  on the other hand, only showed detectable interaction with emir <dig>  whereas none of the parasite ilps interacted with emir <dig> or hir.

taken together, these analyses demonstrate that the e. multilocularis genome encodes ilps, but the respective genes appear to be mainly involved in developmental processes of the adult stage which resides in the definitive host’s gut and, thus, has no access to host-derived insulin. as previously shown  <cit> , human insulin could interact with emir <dig> and we now demonstrated that it also interacts with the lbd of emir <dig>  finally, of all ilps tested, only human insulin appeared capable of acting as a ligand for emir <dig> 

discussion
since the initial characterization of a member of the insulin receptor family in e. multilocularis, emir <dig>  <cit> , few studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of mammalian insulin on flatworm parasite insulin signalling pathways and development. in each of the related parasites schistosoma mansoni and s. japonicum, two emir1-like tyrosine kinases of the insulin receptor family were identified and, as originally shown for emir <dig>  the possibility of an interaction of these receptors with host insulin was verified using the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> . these studies did, however, not address whether host-derived insulin would stimulate  parasite development and/or establishment within the host. although ahier et al.  <cit>  later investigated effects of host insulin on glucose uptake of s. mansoni in vitro, significant stimulation was only achieved using hormone concentrations of 1 μm, which can be considered non-physiologically high since plasma levels of insulin in humans and animals usually range between  <dig> to  <dig> nm  <cit> . likewise, in studies on cestode systems conducted by canclini and esteves  <cit>   and escobedo et al.  <cit>  , effects on glucose metabolism or parasite development  were only observed at insulin concentrations several magnitudes higher than physiological concentrations. hence, although several investigations had already addressed the possibility of insulin-based hormonal cross communication between flatworm parasites and mammalian hosts, it is still unclear to date whether host insulin at physiological concentrations indeed influences parasite development and metabolism or whether such effects are mediated by evolutionarily conserved insulin signalling systems of these parasites.

in the present study, we concentrated on a cestode, e. multilocularis, the larval stage of which displays a strong organ-tropism towards the liver where the highest insulin concentrations  within mammals can be measured  <cit> . several independent lines of evidence clearly indicate that e. multilocularis larvae are responsive to exogenously added host-insulin at physiological concentrations. first,  <dig> nm insulin significantly increased the production of metacestode vesicles from parasite stem cells as well as the re-differentiation of protoscoleces towards metacestode vesicles, and also significantly stimulated parasite stem cell proliferation in primary cell cultures and metacestode vesicles, as measured by the incorporation of brdu. second, the uptake of radioactively labelled glucose by metacestode vesicles was significantly stimulated in the presence of  <dig> nm host insulin. third, exogenously added host insulin clearly affected the phosphorylation profiles of components of the pi3k/akt signalling pathway in the metacestode. on the basis of these data, we propose that insulin constitutes an important host factor that influences the development and physiology of e. multilocularis larvae within the liver. the observed effects were most striking for initial metacestode development from stem cells, which could aid the parasite in establishing itself early during an infection, when it is most vulnerable to attacks by the host immune system  <cit> . compared to primary cells, somewhat lower effects were observed on the proliferation of mature metacestode vesicles, which could be due to the fact that this stage contains significantly lower proportions of stem cells that are capable of proliferation than the primary culture system . on the other hand, given the important role of glycogen as the main energy source for larval cestode metabolism, the observed effects of host insulin on glucose uptake by e. multilocularis could be important for long-term persistence of the parasite within the host. whether the insulin-stimulated re-differentiation of protoscoleces towards the metacestode is important in vivo still remains to be determined. protoscolex re-differentiation in experimental secondary echinococcosis or following accidental or surgery-induced rupture of parasite cysts is a well described phenomenon  <cit>  and at least for e. granulosus it is thought that parasite persistence within the host is aided by re-differentiation of existing protoscoleces once the mother hydatid cyst experienced physical damage  <cit> . in this regard, the influx of elevated concentrations of host insulin into ruptured parasite cysts, followed by increased re-differentiation of protoscoleces, may well contribute to prolonged parasite survival. however, whether these mechanisms are also relevant to e. multiocularis infections is still not clear. in any case, the observed effects of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm insulin on protoscolex re-differentiation again demonstrate that e. multilocularis larvae are well responsive to physiological concentrations of insulin.

since our data revealed that insulin significantly stimulates metacestode vesicle formation from primary cell cultures in a system that mimics the natural oncosphere-metacestode-transition, it is, of course, tempting to speculate that the relatively strict organ-tropism of e. multilocularis towards the host liver  <cit>  may, at least in part, depend on the high insulin concentrations usually present in this organ. although this is supported by our data showing that host insulin stimulates proliferation of e. multilocularis stem cells, which is in line with the role of insulin signalling in proliferation control of neoblasts in free-living flatworms  <cit> , further experiments addressing insulin effects on naturally isolated oncospheres are necessary to obtain a conclusive picture. this would also require comparative analyses on oncospheres from e. granulosus, which display a relaxed liver organ tropism, and those of taenia solium , which usually don’t develop in the host liver, despite an entry route into the host comparable to that of e. multilocularis <cit> . it is interesting to note in this context that escobedo et al.  <cit>  did not observe effects on t. solium cysticerci under high insulin treatment conditions that stimulated larval budding in t. crassiceps. however, care has to be taken in the interpretation of their results, since for t. solium the authors measured scolex evagination which is not, per se, a developmental process.

according to the theory of hormonal host-helminth cross-communication, endo- and paracrine hormonal systems of mammals  could influence the physiology and development of metazoan parasites through stimulation of evolutionarily conserved signalling systems  <cit> . this theory has thus far been supported by several in vitro studies showing that parasite surface receptor kinases of the insulin-, the egf- and the tgf-β-families can principally bind respective host-derived hormones  <cit> . one of the most convincing examples supporting this theory has been brought up by vicogne et al.  <cit>  who demonstrated that human egf can activate an egf-receptor, such as tyrosine kinase of s. mansoni in vitro and at the surface of schistosomes, and that exogenously added egf also influences protein and dna synthesis in the parasite. we now propose the host-insulin-e. multilocularis-emir <dig> system as another example that supports this theory. again, several lines of evidence clearly indicate that at least some of the effects of host insulin on e. multilocularis development and physiology involve binding of the host hormone to the insulin-receptor-like tyrosine kinase emir <dig>  first, exogenously added host insulin influences emir <dig> phosphorylation patterns in the metacestode which is prevented in the presence of an anti-insulin-receptor inhibitor. second, host insulin particularly influenced the phosphorylation of components of the pi3k/akt pathway, which is known to act downstream of insulin-receptor tyrosine kinases in many organisms  <cit> , and this was prevented in the presence of an insulin receptor inhibitor. since the stimulation of the pi3k/akt pathway through insulin receptors requires irss as intermediate signalling molecules  <cit> , a binding site for which is present in emir <dig> , the activation of this pathway in e. multilocularis most likely involves emir <dig>  third, although e. multilocularis encodes ilps, the expression levels of the respective genes in the metacestode are very low and none of the parasite ilps interacted with emir <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assays, indicating that host insulin is the only emir <dig> activating hormone present in significant concentrations around the growing metacestode. in this respect, it is even tempting to speculate that emir <dig> entirely lost the capacity to be stimulated by parasite-encoded ilps since it is most active in parasite stages that have contact with elevated concentrations of host insulin. we, thus, propose that several of the actions of insulin on the e. multilocularis metacestode, particularly the stimulation of glucose uptake and the stimulation of metacestode proliferation, are mediated by direct binding of the host hormone to emir <dig>  followed by subsequent activation of insulin-dependent parasite signalling pathways. this should be particularly relevant in the echinococcus gscs, which display the highest expression levels of emir <dig> and are the cell type responsible for carbohydrate storage.

although emir <dig> at the protein level was not detected in the e. multilocularis primary cell cultivation system, we could observe clear effects of host insulin on the formation of metacestode vesicles from parasite stem cells. these effects are, thus, most probably mediated independently of emir <dig> and in the present study we identified a second e. multilocularis insulin receptor molecule, emir <dig>  which could be involved in the effects on parasite stem cells. on the one hand, our histochemical analyses showed that emir <dig> expression is dispersed through primary cell aggregates, which contain a large number of parasite stem cells  <cit> . furthermore, the in situ hybridization experiments presented in this work clearly indicate that at least in developing protoscoleces, emir <dig> transcripts are closely associated with the proliferation zone where parasite stem cells are most active , indicating a link between emir <dig> and stem cell proliferation or differentiation. the presence of two insulin receptor encoding genes in e. multilocularis closely resembles the situation in the related schistosomes, which also express two molecules of this class  <cit> . as with the schistosome receptor lbds, which interacted with human insulin in the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> , we herein demonstrated that in addition to emir <dig>  emir <dig> can also interact with the host hormone. since the echinococcus emilp <dig> gene was expressed at low, but detectable, levels in primary cells and since the encoded peptide, emilp <dig>  interacted with emir <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system, we cannot exclude that a certain level of stimulation of emir <dig> by emilp <dig> in primary cells could contribute to initial parasite development within the liver. however, our experiments clearly indicate that physiological levels of human insulin, that should be present at the site of initial parasite development from the oncosphere, can significantly add to these effects. hence, it is conceivable that during the oncosphere-metacestode transition both emilp <dig> and human insulin bind to emir <dig>  which could lead to higher activation of the parasite receptor than through emilp <dig> alone, and which could thus promote rapid parasite establishment. whether this indeed occurs in vivo and which parasite signalling pathways act downstream of emir <dig>  given that it lacks the conserved npxy motif, still remains to be established. unfortunately, and in contrast to the metacestode vesicle culture system, membrane fractionation and insulin stimulation studies are very difficult to carry out on the stem cell cultivation system due to the fragility of stem cell aggregates and their high sensitivity to serum-free cultivation conditions. nevertheless, given that emir <dig> is capable of interacting with human insulin in the yeast two hybrid system and that it is expressed as the only parasite insulin receptor in the primary cell system, hormonal host-parasite cross-communication through insulin-binding to emir <dig> could indeed play a significant role in parasite establishment within the liver.

ahier et al.  <cit>  and you et al.  <cit>  previously used inhibitors specifically designed to bind to insulin receptor-like kinases and observed deleterious effects on the uptake and consumption of glucose by schistosomes, indicating that at least the mechanisms of glucose uptake, similar to echinococcus as shown in this study, are under the control of insulin signalling in these parasites. in the present study, we employed hnmpa <dig>  the same inhibitor used by you et al.  <cit> , and observed various effects on the development of metacestode vesicles from primary cells, on the survival of mature metacestode vesicles and on the re-differentiation process from protoscoleces towards the metacestode. in mature metacestode vesicles, only relatively high concentrations  of hnmpa <dig> led to killing and we suggest that this mostly involved binding of the drug to emir <dig>  accompanied by defects in glucose uptake and consumption. that the drug can principally bind to emir <dig> is supported by our in silico analyses showing that the parasite receptor’s atp-binding pocket is capable of harbouring hnmpa <dig> with considerable affinity. compared to mature metacestode vesicles, the effects of hnmpa <dig> on primary cells were much more dramatic. already at a concentration of 25 μm, the insulin receptor inhibitor completely prevented the formation of metacestode vesicles from parasite stem cells. since emir <dig> is not expressed in this parasite stage, we suggest that emir <dig> is also capable of binding hnmpa <dig>  maybe even with higher affinity than emir <dig>  indeed, in a recent report vanderstraete et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that hnmpa <dig> inhibits the schistosome receptor smir <dig>  with much higher efficacy  than smir <dig> . when applied to the echinococcus system, this could explain the relative resistance of the  metacestode to the drug when compared to the  primary cell system. however, care has to be taken in the interpretation of data on insulin inhibitor effects on flatworms since vanderstraete et al.  <cit>  also showed that these can affect a structurally diverse family of receptor kinases that are composed of an extracellular venus flytrap  motif and an intracellular, insulin receptor-like tkd. in s. mansoni, two of these kinases, named smvkr <dig> and smvkr <dig>  are expressed and a panel of available insulin receptor inhibitors that showed effects on smir <dig> and smir <dig> also affected smvkr <dig> and smvkr <dig> in a similar manner  <cit> . in the e. multilocularis genome, only one gene encoding such a tyrosine kinase, emvkr, is present and transcriptome data indicate that it is expressed in a similar manner as emir <dig> . for the inhibitor data concerning emir <dig> phosphorylation upon addition of insulin, we do not see interpretation problems since this was carried out specifically for emir <dig>  immunoprecipitated from membrane fractions. however, at least some of the effects we observed on entire echinococcus larvae after application of hnmpa <dig> could indeed be due to inhibition of emvkr rather than emir <dig> and emir <dig>  unfortunately, it is presently not possible to clearly distinguish between these possibilities since highly selective inhibitors for the parasite insulin receptors versus the vkr receptors are not available  <cit>  and since rnai methodology for e. multilocularis is still in its infancy. nevertheless, our data indicate that the insulin signalling system of e. multilocularis, including insulin receptor kinases, emvkr, and downstream signalling components, might be a fruitful target for the development of novel chemotherapeutics, as has previously been argued in the case of schistosomes  <cit> .

in summary, our data indicate an important role of host insulin on the development of e. multilocularis larvae within the host’s liver. we also showed that this involves hormonal host-parasite cross-communication via evolutionarily conserved signalling systems, which is particularly striking for emir <dig> concerning glucose uptake in gscs of the metacestode and, most likely, also applies to emir <dig> in the primary cell system. using a well-known inhibitor of insulin receptor signalling, we also demonstrated clear effects on parasite survival and, particularly, development. although hnmpa <dig> might not be as efficient as other kinase inhibitors, such as pyridinyl imidazoles  <cit>  or imatinib  <cit> , in inducing killing of the metacestode, which is the main target of chemotherapy against alveolar echinococcosis, our study now opens the way for the development of more specific inhibitors that could be used to affect glucose uptake by the parasite during development. furthermore, due to their obvious effects on parasite stem cell proliferation, insulin receptor inhibitors might be used to inhibit asexual multiplication of an already established parasite mass or to prevent metastasis formation from stem cells in advanced cases of the disease  <cit> . since the somewhat lower efficacy of hnmpa <dig> to inactivate metacestode vesicles  could at least in part be due to problems in penetrating the laminated layer which surrounds the parasite cells, issues of improved tissue penetration should also be considered in studies on the development of anti-insulin signalling drugs against ae.

CONCLUSIONS
the e. multilocularis metacestode larval stage displays a marked organ-tropism towards the mammalian host’s liver where it grows infiltratively, like a malignant tumour, and where the highest concentrations of insulin within the mammalian body can be found. we herein demonstrate that mammalian insulin influences e. multilocularis larval development at physiological concentrations which, to the best of our knowledge, is also the first report on stimulatory effects of physiological insulin concentrations on any flatworm parasite. our data indicate that e. multilocularis insulin signalling pathways, consisting of two insulin receptor-like tyrosine kinases and downstream components of the pi3k/akt-pathway, are mediating these effects, which supports the theory that hormonal host-parasite cross-communication through evolutionarily conserved signalling systems plays an important role in echinococcus infections. that the effects we observed in vitro are also of relevance in vivo is indicated by the fact that the metacestode stage, which grows continuously within the host liver, is not producing intrinsic insulin-like peptides for the main receptor of this stage, emir <dig>  thus leaving host-derived insulin as the only relevant hormone of this class at the site of infection. although further investigations are needed to establish a clear connection between the parasite’s insulin responsiveness and the marked organ-tropism towards the host liver, we nevertheless suggest that the constantly elevated supply of insulin within the liver  at least contributes to the initial development of the metacestode from parasite stem cells, and supports asexual multiplication of the metacestode. by our investigations on the inhibition of insulin signalling pathways in e. multilocularis, we also identified a lead compound that could facilitate the development of novel and effective anti-echinococcosis drugs in the future. investigations into this direction, addressing the parasite’s insulin receptor-like kinases, but also downstream components such as pi3k and akt, are currently underway.
