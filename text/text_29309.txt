BACKGROUND
snake venoms are chemically complex mixtures of pharmacologically active proteins or peptides, which serve not only as a source of digestive enzymes, but also play an important role in immobilizing the prey and acting as offensive weapons. they can target multiple tissues, causing simultaneous damage of multiple physiological systems. one of the components which contribute significantly to the lethality of snake venoms is phospholipase a <dig>    <cit> . pla <dig> constitutes a family of structurally related proteins hydrolyze phospholipids at the sn- <dig> position in a calcium-dependent manner, releasing fatty acids and lysophospholipids  <cit> . snake venom pla2s are low-molecular weight , secretory phospholipases containing seven disulfide bonds. based on their amino acid sequence and disulfide bond pattern, snake venom pla2s are classified into group i pla <dig>  or group ii pla <dig>   <cit> . usually, the group ii pla2s are further subdivided into two major subgroups: the asp- <dig> pla2s , which have an aspartic acid at position  <dig> and high catalytic activity towards artificial phospholipid substrates; and lys- <dig> pla2s , which have a lysine substitutes at position  <dig> and very low or no hydrolytic activity towards artificial phospholipid substrates  <cit> . recently, a unique subgroup of snake venom group ii pla <dig>  named n <dig> pla <dig> subgroup was identified from several asiatic snake venoms  <cit> . the n <dig> pla <dig> was found to differ from the other subgroups in its structure and biological activities.

besides the digestive function, snake pla2s exhibit severalother pharmacological properties including antiplatelet  <cit> , anticoagulant  <cit> , hemolytic  <cit> , neurotoxic   <cit> , myotoxic  <cit> . they have also been employed widely as pharmacological tools to investigate the roles of these enzymes in diverse models of experimental inflammatory processes such as edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and mast cells activation  <cit> . mast cells are primarily located in mucosal and perivascular areas of various tissues, which play an important role in body defense processes. recent studies found that mast cells can be activated by snake venom and release carboxypeptidase a and possibly other proteases, which can degrade venom components  <cit> . our former study also showed that atrahagin, a metalloprotienase purified from naja atra snake, could potently activate human colon, lung and tonsil mast cells to release histamine  <cit> . several snake venom pla2s were reported to be able to activate the rat mast cells, to induce microvascular leakage and inflammatory cell accumulation at the sites of inflammation  <cit> . however, little is known of the action of n <dig> pla2s on human mast cells, and the mechanisms through which n <dig> pla <dig> induces microvascular leakage and inflammatory cell accumulation still remain obscure. therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of tm-n <dig>  <cit>  in induction of microvascular leakage and mast cell accumulation and activation in the present study.

RESULTS
purification and characterization of tm-n49
approximately  <dig> mg of tm-n <dig> was obtained from  <dig>  g protobothrops mucrosquamatus crude venom following the procedures described above. the purity of the pla <dig> was at least 98% as assessed by sds-page, hplc and mass spectrometry analysis.

induction of microvascular leakage by tm-n49
tm-n <dig> at doses of  <dig> – <dig>  μg provoked a dose dependent increase in microvascular leakage in the skin of rats at  <dig> min following injection. as little as  <dig>  μg was able to stimulate significant skin edema after injection indicating that tm-n <dig> is a potent stimulus. the potency of tm-n <dig> in induction of skin edema is similar to that of bradykinin and histamine on the weight basis  . pretreatment of rats with compound 48/ <dig> for a period longer than  <dig> h clearly diminished the skin responsiveness of the rats to tm-n <dig> and histamine , and dramatically reduced mast cell numbers in the peritoneal lavage fluid of these rats .

influence of anti-inflammatory compounds on microvascular leakage
ginkgolide b at a dose of  <dig> μg inhibited  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 40% microvascular leakage induced by paf, histamine and tm-n <dig>  respectively when it was co-injected with these stimuli. cyproheptadine at a dose of  <dig> μg also inhibited  <dig> % and  <dig> % histamine and tm-n <dig> elicited microvascular leakage. terfenadine and quinacrine at the dose of  <dig> μg had little effect on tm-n <dig> provoked microvascular leakage in rat skin . all anti-inflammatory compounds tested by themselves had no significant effect on the microvascular leakage in rat skin .

induction of histamine release from mast cells by tm-n49
a dose dependent release of histamine from colon, lung and tonsil mast cells was observed when various concentrations of tm-n <dig> were incubated with cells for  <dig> min. as low as  <dig>  μg/ml of tm-n <dig> was able to stimulate significant histamine release from human colon and lung mast cells, but to stimulate a similar level of histamine release from tonsil mast cells a minimum of  <dig>  μg/ml of tm-n <dig> was required. while tm-n <dig> at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml was able to provoke approximately 30%, 15% and 62% net histamine release, anti-ige antibody at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml stimulated approximately 17%, 17% and 11% net histamine release from colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, respectively in the parallel experiments. at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml, tm-n <dig> induced also significant histamine release from colon and tonsil mast cells when calcium and magnesium were absent in the challenge buffer .

time course for tm-n <dig> induced histamine release
immediately after adding  <dig> μg/ml of tm-n <dig> to cells, histamine release from colon, lung and tonsil mast cells occurred. approximately  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the maximum of histamine release were observed following incubation of tm-n <dig> with colon, lung and tonsil cells, respectively for  <dig> min. at the same time point, anti-ige antibody at  <dig> μg/ml induced  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the maximum of histamine release, and calcium ionophore at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml provoked  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the maximum of histamine release from colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, respectively .

the peak of histamine released from colon, tonsil and lung mast cells in response to tm-n <dig> occurred at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min following tm-n <dig> being added to cells, whereas in the parallel experiments, the peak histamine release induced by anti-ige antibody occurred at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min for colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, respectively. similarly, the peak histamine release provoked by calcium ionophore appeared at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min for colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, respectively. the maximum release of histamine was then sustained at least to  <dig> min .

effects of metabolic inhibitors and pertussis toxin on histamine release
when cells were pretreated with metabolic inhibitors for  <dig> min  <dig> μg/ml of tm-n <dig> induced histamine release from colon, lung and tonsil mast cells was completely abolished. however, metabolic inhibitors exhibited little effect on histamine release from tonsil mast cells when  <dig> μg/ml of tm-n <dig> was added to cells. similarly, metabolic inhibitors dramatically inhibited anti-ige antibody provoked histamine release from colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, but had relatively less efficient inhibition of calcium ionophore elicited histamine release from mast cells . pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin for  <dig> h reduced dramatically their responses to tm-n <dig> and anti-ige antibody, but had no significant effect on their ability to release histamine in response to calcium ionophore .

the values shown are mean ± se for four to five separate experiments performed in duplicate. cells were incubated with metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxy-d-glucose  and antimycin a  for  <dig> min at 37°c before challenging with stimulus. * p <  <dig>  compared with the corresponding uninhibited controls.

induction of mast cell accumulation by tm-n49
as early as  <dig> min following injection,  <dig> μg of tm-n <dig> was able to induce significant mast cell accumulation in the peritoneum of mice. the mast cell accumulation induced by tm-n <dig> appeared to at least maintain for  <dig> h. as little as  <dig>  μg of tm-n <dig> was able to potently induce mast cell infiltration in the peritoneum of mice at  <dig> h and  <dig> h following injection . however, relative mast cell number in mouse peritoneum was not significantly increased except for  <dig> μg of tm-n <dig> injected for  <dig> h. at  <dig> μg, tm-n <dig> markedly reduced relative number of mast cells at all the time points examined following injection .

various doses of tm-n <dig> were injected into the peritoneum of mice for  <dig> min,  <dig> h,  <dig> h or  <dig> h. also shown are the responses to normal saline control. relative number of mast cells was defined as the percentage of mast cell in total nucleated cells. * p <  <dig>  compared with the response to saline alone.

effects of anti-inflammatory compounds and blocking antibodies on mast cell accumulation
when co-injected, ginkgolide b, cyproheptadine and terfenadine inhibited  <dig> %, 80% and 100% tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation in the peritoneum of mice, respectively. however, quinacrine did not significantly alter the extent of tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation. at the dose tested, ginkgolide b, cyproheptadine, terfenadine and quinacrine by themselves failed to induce mast cell accumulation in the peritoneum of mice .

the values shown are medians  for six separate experiments. compounds were injected into the mouse peritoneum for  <dig> h before peritoneal lavage fluid being collected. * p <  <dig>  compared with the response to tm-n <dig> alone.

intravenous injection of monoclonal antibodies against cd <dig>  icam- <dig> and cd11a  <dig> min prior to intra-peritoneal injection of the pla <dig> blocked tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation by 70% and 99%, respectively. monoclonal antibodies against l-selectin failed to diminish tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation in the peritoneum of mice. normal rat and hamster igg isotype controls tested had little effect on tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation .

the values shown are medians  for six separate experiments. monoclonal antibodies  against the adhesion molecules l-selectin, lfa- <dig>  cd <dig> and icam- <dig> were intravenously injected, respectively for  <dig> min before intra-peritoneal injection of  <dig> μg of tm-n <dig> for  <dig> h. * p <  <dig>  compared with the response to tm-n <dig> alone.

discussion
as a novel subgroup of snake venom group ii pla <dig>  the proinflammatory activities of n <dig> pla <dig> have not yet been studied. therefore, this is the first study to investigate the potential actions of n <dig> pla <dig> in inflammation. tm-n <dig> was found to be a potent stimulus of microvascular leakage in the skin of rats. the potency of this unique, inactive pla <dig> in induction of microvascular leakage is similar to the potency of bradykinin and histamine on a molar basis. therefore it is not difficult to anticipate that tm-n <dig> by itself should be able to induce severe inflammatory reactions upon snake bite.

since histamine/5-ht antagonist cyproheptadine abolished the tm-n49-induced microvascular leakage, but selective histamine h <dig> receptor antagonist terfenadine did not, the action of tm-n <dig> on skin edema seems to be histamine independent. it is likely that 5-ht and other mast cell products, such as paf, serine proteases, leukotrienes, prostaglandins are involved in the process  <cit> . indeed, it was observed that ginkgolide b, a paf receptor antagonist inhibited microvascular leakage induced by tm-n <dig>  suggesting that paf was involved in the microvascular leakage process. mast cell mediated edema formation in response to different snake venom pla <dig> has been reported previously. thus, pla <dig> from vipera russeli, naja mocambique and honey bee produced a rapid but transient oedematous response in rat paw  <cit> . bothropstoxin-i and bothropstoxin-ii, two k <dig> pla2s isolated from bothrops jararacussu snake venom caused dose-dependent rat paw and skin oedema formation  <cit> . pla2s from crotalus durissus cascavella, crotalus durissus collilineatus and crotalus durissus terrificus venoms increased the vascular permeability in the rat skin  <cit> . however, the observed reduction of mast cell numbers by injection of compound 48/ <dig> hardly affects the inflammatory potential of tm-n49: even a 10-fold reduction in detectable mast cells does not result in a significant reduction of extravasation. this implied that mast cell activation may not be the relevant mechanism for tm-n <dig> induced skin edema. it is difficult to exclude the possibility that tm-n <dig> bound to a receptor of pla <dig> and caused microvascular leakage, though the latter has not yet been identified. recently, it was found that snake venom catalytically inactive pla <dig> homologue could binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- <dig> via a c-terminal loop region, exhibiting mast cell unrelated mechanism for the increased the vascular permeability  <cit> .

in order to study the activation of mast cells by tm-n <dig>  mast cell challenge experiments were performed. tm-n <dig> can activate human colon, lung and tonsil mast cells in a dose dependent manner. it was discovered further that tm-n <dig> induced mast cell degranulation is an energy consuming process and involved a g protein coupled receptor in mast cells  <cit>  as both metabolic inhibitors and pertussis toxin were capable of inhibiting tm-n <dig> elicited histamine release from mast cells. it was reported previously that pla2s were able to directly activate rat mast cells in vitro  <cit> . the action of d <dig> pla2s on rat mast cells was dependent on their catalytic activity  <cit> , whereas the influence of k <dig> pla2s, which possess negligible catalytic activity, on rat mast cells was through a heparin-sensitive mechanism  <cit> . removal of ca2+ and mg2+ from challenge buffer greatly reduced the cell response to the stimulation of tm-n <dig> indicated that exogenous calcium and magnesium ions were crucial for mast cell degranulation induced by tm-n <dig>  the increased serotonin level in mouse peritoneal lavage fluid supplied further evidence on tm-n <dig> causing mast cell degranulation in rats as mast cells are major source  of serotonin in mouse peritoneum. the most relevant mast cell population in regard to snake bites would be skin mast cells which differ in phenotype and activating stimuli from other mast cell populations. from those populations investigated, tonsil mast cells most closely resemble skin mast cells  <cit> . interestingly, as shown in figure  <dig>  tonsil mast cells only responded to rather high concentrations of tm-n <dig>  and the overall release  is very little compared to other venom components   <cit> . tm-n <dig> at  <dig> μg appears to be toxic, as the observed release is later shown to be ca2+-independent. this, again, indicates that mast cell activation may not be the relevant mechanism for tm-n <dig> induced inflammation.

with a mouse peritoneal model, it was found for the first time that snake venom pla <dig> could induce mast cell accumulation even at  <dig> min following injection. this appeared not a mast cell-specific effect since the relative number of mast cells in total nucleated cells was not significantly altered. the action of tm-n <dig> in induction of mast cell accumulation could be inhibited by co-injection of tm-n <dig> with ginkgolide b, cyproheptadine and terfenadine, suggesting that histamine, 5-ht and paf may play a role in mast cell accumulation induced by tm-n <dig>  antibodies specific for cd <dig>  cd11a and icam- <dig> blocked tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation, while l-selectin specific antibody failed to do so. these observations suggested that lfa- <dig>  and icam- <dig>  but not l-selectin were involved in the tm-n <dig> induced mast cell migration process. involvement of cd11a/cd <dig> and icam- <dig> in mast cell migration was reported previously with saban et al.  <cit> . since mast cells and endothelial cells express both lfa- <dig> and icam- <dig>  <cit> , we believe that cd11/cd <dig> and icam- <dig> are important adhesion molecules for tm-n <dig> induced mast cell migration. the increase in mast cell numbers could be regarded as a beneficial host response since mast cells were shown to be able to detoxify venom components  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a novel snake venom group ii pla <dig>  tm-n <dig> was able to induce a dramatic increase in microvascular permeability in the skin of rats. the action of tm-n <dig> appeared to be unrelated to the activation of mast cells. indeed, it was confirmed that tm-n <dig> was able to stimulate mast cell degranulation and accumulation. the ability of tm-n <dig> in induction of microvascular leakage, mast cell degranulation and mast cell infiltration implicates that it is a potent proinflammatory factor in snake venom.
