BACKGROUND
grapevine  is one of the most widely cultivated species of agricultural interest  <cit> , spread from central asia to the mediterranean basin  <cit> . two subspecies, v. vinifera l. subsp. sylvestris  hegi and v. vinifera l. subsp. sativa  hegi, are considered to co-exist. the first one represented by wild populations and the second one represented by cultivated varieties obtained from wild individuals through a domestication process  <cit> . the two subspecies show differences in several phenotypic traits, one of the most distinctive traits is the flower sex, dioecious for wild grapes and hermaphroditic, or, to a lesser extent, female, for cultivated grapes  <cit> .

the domestication of wild grapes started in the neolithic age, about  <dig>  years ago, as a result of a long and gradual process closely linked to winemaking  <cit> . archaeological remains and proto-historical sources suggest the near east area, comprising the south caucasus, oriental anatolia, syria and the area around northern mesopotamia, as the first centre of domestication  <cit> . from the primary domestication areas, the grapevine spread to neighbouring regions and followed different pathways and successive waves firstly towards mesopotamia, east mediterranean basin, north africa, southern balkans and aegean region; secondly towards sicily, southern italy, france and spain; and finally towards central europe, mainly through the main trade routes of rhine, rhone and danube rivers  <cit> . in agreement with these general dispersal pathways, many studies of grapevine genetic diversity supported the hypothesis of secondary domestication centres in the mediterranean area, considering the crucial role of the near east in grapevine domestication, and the introgression processes, from wild compartment of the secondary centres of domestication, in the cultivated germplasm, as complementary sources of genetic diversity in the domesticated gene pool  <cit> .

a decisive contribution to interpret the molecular diversity of v. vinifera and its putative geographic origin was given by the analysis of two large grapevine collections  <cit> . the first one repository, the grape germplasm collection of us department of agriculture   <cit> , includes over  <dig>  vinifera accessions . the genetic variability of this collection, investigated by the vitis9ksnp array , showed a near east origin of v. vinifera and presented evidence of introgression from local sylvestris individuals in the cultivated accessions along the european spread routes. the second collection analyzed was the largest grapevines repository located in vassal   <cit> , counting for  <dig>  unique genotypes representative of the grape growing areas around the world  <cit> . the microsatellite analysis revealed three main genetic groups and two additional groups, subdividing accessions according to geographic origin  and human use .

allowing the from-east-to-west trend, the genetic variability study of grapevine germplasm  coming from the first domestication centre, highlighted the uniqueness and originality of georgian germplasm in respect to the worldwide accessions  <cit> .

since the ‘80s, different kinds of molecular markers increasingly more accurate, reproducible, repeatable, rapid and less expensive have been developed. the last frontier reached with the new generation sequencing  technologies is the high throughput snp genotyping, a whole genome genotyping  assay that permits the economic and reliable screening of tens/hundreds of thousands markers per assay, leading the molecular characterization using snp routine. snp arrays were developed for apple/pear   <cit> , maize   <cit> , peach   <cit> , potato   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . regarding grapevine, two different high throughput snp arrays are available, the first one containing  <dig>  snps  <cit>  and the second one including  <dig>  snps as part of the grapereseq consortium  <cit> .

the main objective of this study was to investigate the level of genetic diversity, relationships and structure of dataset obtained by vitis18ksnp array and to compare the usefulness of this new generation markers system in respect to the traditional ssr  used in  <cit> . we applied 18 k snp descriptors, chosen in the frame of grapereseq consortium, to analyse  <dig> grapevine accessions representative of wild and cultivated georgian germplasms, considered valuable genetic resources by the genetic and agronomic point of view.

cluster analysis
the genetic similarity among the different samples was calculated by dice’s coefficient   <cit>  and the grapevine accessions were grouped in clusters   <cit>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  the genotypes showed different levels of similarity ranging from  <dig> and 100 %. sixty-eight unique profiles were identified,  <dig> for the sativa compartment and  <dig> for the sylvestris compartment. three pairs of matching genotypes were found, one among cultivars and two among sylvestris individuals.fig.  <dig> dendrogram showing relationships among cultivated and wild georgian genotypes using 18 k snp loci. dendrogram generated using upgma method. solid branch lines: cultivated georgian genotypes; dotted branch lines: wild georgian genotypes



using the threshold value of 88 % for similarity index, two main groups were identified, one grouping cultivar samples and one for wild individuals. the 95 % of accessions were clusterized according to accession taxonomic status, except two cultivated genotypes  and two sylvestris individuals  grouped in the sativa cluster. in the sativa cluster, the cultivars were arranged in two well distinct sub-clusters showing 87 % of similarity and including  <dig> and  <dig> unique profiles, respectively. the differentiation among cultivated and wild georgian compartments was evaluated by nei’s genetic distance  <cit>  and fst  <cit> . the two parameters reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  values, respectively.

population structure analysis and differentiation
in order to identify the structure of populations and the correlations among samples, two different methods were performed. the first method was the pcoa analysis  <cit> , computed based on the genetic distance matrix obtained by snp profiles. two dimensional projections of pcoa analysis per each sample were plotted in a 2-d dimension scattered plot . the first two principal components , accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total variation, differentiated clearly the genotypes into  <dig> main groups, despite the presence of overlapping areas: two groups including cultivars  and one for wild individuals . in the overlapping areas, several cultivated samples appeared borderline with w <dig> samples. along the pc <dig>  a separation between c <dig> and w <dig> groups was highlighted, while the discrimination of c <dig> group was highlighted by the pc <dig> fig.  <dig> relationships between wild and cultivated georgian samples as represented by the first two principal coordinates of pcoa using snp profiles. c1: western cultivars; c2: southern cultivars; w1: wild individuals



the second method used to infer the relationship among genotypes was the clustering algorithm implemented in the faststructure program  <cit> . in order to uncover the hierarchical population structure, different numbers of k populations were explored . optimal k estimated the most likely number of populations at k =  <dig>  using a > <dig>  % threshold for group assignation,  <dig> samples  were assigned to a cluster at k =  <dig> . structure clustering highlighted  <dig> groups: two groups for sativa samples  and one for sylvestris individuals , including  <dig>   <dig> and 33 % of the entire genetic pool, respectively. in g <dig>  only putative wild accessions  were included. the inbreeding coefficient  within three subpopulations identified by structure analysis ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> admixture proportions of wild and cultivated georgian groups, as estimated by faststructure at k =  <dig>  displayed in a barplot. each sample is represented as a vertical bar, reflecting assignment probabilities to each of the three groups. g1: red bars; g2: purple bars; g3: green bars



parentage analysis
pairwise ibd  analysis was used to investigate the first-degree  and second-degree relationships among the wild and cultivated georgian individuals by plink  <cit> . for an ideal situation without genotyping errors and/or mutations, z <dig>  and z <dig>  of po pairs are expected to be  <dig> and z <dig> ; z <dig> and z <dig> of 2nd degree pairs are expected to be  <dig>  and z <dig> to be  <dig>  therefore, pairs of genotypes holding a pi-hat  value similar to  <dig>  are related by first-degree or closer relationships. two pairs of individuals  having z <dig> and z <dig> near  <dig>  z <dig> values higher than  <dig>  and with relatively high proportion of ibd  were considered po pairs. one po pair was identified between two wild samples  and one between wild and cultivated samples . while, five pairs of samples  with proportion of ibd  ≈  <dig>  and relatively high z <dig> and z <dig>  values were considered 2nd degree pairs. the remaining pairs of individuals were considered “unrelated” according to the relationships identified. no 2nd degree relationships were identified among wild accessions and wild and cultivated samples.table  <dig> parentage analysis and relationship categories assignment  for wild and cultivated georgian grapevines obtained by snp allelic profiles

discussion
genetic variability of georgian sativa and sylvestris germplasms
in order to develop appropriate strategy for long-term conservation of the georgian  grapevine biodiversity, the identification and characterization of genetic resources is mandatory. there are not definitive data giving an estimation of the number of autochthonous varieties in this area:  <dig> varieties are listed in the ampelography of georgia  <cit> , only  <dig> were described in the ampelography of the soviet union , but only  <dig> remained in old collections until  <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, the new vitis18ksnp array, containing  <dig>  snp markers, were used to analyse the genetic relationship among a dataset of cultivated  and putative wild  grapevine accessions belonging to the autochthonous germplasm of georgia.

the snp statistic parameters calculated to determine the genetic diversity of georgian germplasm reflected the results published in  <cit> , regarding the genetic variability investigated by ssr markers. considering the difference in the number of analysed accessions and the kind of molecular markers, the trend of ne , ho  and he  values between sativa and sylvestris compartments were almost comparable with the values evidenced in the previously cited work and in other works devoted to the study of cultivated and wild grapevines  <cit> . for sativa compartment, the ho value appeared slightly higher than the he value; while for wild accessions, the trend was opposite. the ho reduction observed overall sylvestris samples and among populations was detected also by other studies  <cit> . it indicated that the wild individuals suffer from inbreeding. this result was not observed for wild grapevine populations of tunisia  <cit> , as well as for the  <dig> spontaneous growing vines from georgia analysed in  <cit> . the maf value was higher for cultivated than wild samples, while, f showed mean value higher for sylvestris individuals  than cultivars, and the same trend reported in  <cit>  was displayed. maf and f values were consistent with ho results, showing that sylvestris compartment is more inbreed than the sativa compartment.

one of the main morphological distinctive traits between wild and cultivated grapevine forms is the flower sex, mostly hermaphrodite for cultivars and male or female for wild grapevine  <cit> . moreover, hermaphrodite wild grapevine plants were also gathered. subspecies sativa is self-pollinating, while subsp. sylvestris has an anemophilous and entomophilous pollination  <cit> . in nature, it was found a predominance of male wild grapevine individuals  <cit> . our results fit this evidence. because of the flower of wild grapevines is unisexual and pollen of male plant fertilizes the ovary of female plant, the reproduction via sexual pathway of kvareli, lagodekhi and tbilisi populations, where only female or male plants were collected, resulted damaged and these population are seriously endangered. based on recent surveys in various european countries  <cit> , the wild grapevine populations appeared severely endangered and the reasons could be addressed to the human activities, ecosystem fragmentation events and spreading of northern american pathogens. nevertheless, in the natural environment, georgian wild grapevine individuals did not show any signs of phylloxera attack. this could be explained because the existence of disease symptoms in wild individuals was verified only when the pest is directly and artificially inoculated  <cit> .

moreover, due to the limited number of individual per population our conclusions about their fitness are not really robust and have to be considered preliminary. further surveys, devoted to explore in detail the spontaneous grapevine populations in georgia and caucasus as well, were conducted in the frame of eu project cost action fa <dig> “east–west collaboration for grapevine diversity exploration and mobilization of adaptive traits for breeding”. fourteen wild populations were investigated in their natural environmental  and a prospecting on the sanitary status of the aerial organs and roots was carried out . a genetic analysis including individuals coming from the latter surveys could give more exhaustive information regarding genetic diversity, fitness and inbreeding rates of grapevine wild populations in the caucasus region.

in both sativa and sylvestris compartments, samples sharing the same allelic profile were found, for a total of  <dig> unique profiles identified . among the cultivars, the two samples sharing the same allelic profiles were rkatsiteli and his berry colour mutant rkatsiteli vardisperi  <cit> .

rkatsiteli vardisperi, a pink-wine grape, is a rkatsiteli clone selected by v. loladze in  <dig>  <cit> . v. vinifera subsp. sativa is a cultigen vegetatively propagated through cuttings or budding. during this reproductive pathway, mutagenic events in the somatic cells of buds could take place and if they are used for propagation they lead to genotype having phenotypic traits different to the mother grapevine. in the sylvestris compartment, two ninotsminda individuals  collected in the same area, sagarejo, shared the same allelic profile, while another accession  showed the same snp profile of delisi  <dig>  an accession coming from tbilisi, about 60 km far from sagarejo . the identification of two identical accessions  collected in the same area could be addressed to a vegetative propagation event occurred to ensure a rapid vine regeneration and soil colonization. on the other hand, an error sampling could be highlighted for ninotsminda  <dig> and delisi  <dig> 

in order to determine the genetic relatedness among genotypes, a clustering analysis was carried out  and the results were validated by pairwise nei’s genetic distance and fst values. a clear differentiation regarding sylvestris and sativa compartments was recognized, using a threshold value for the similarity index lower than 87 %. moreover, the result represented in fig.  <dig> clearly showed that genetic distances are directly proportional to regional distances: the sativa samples were arranged based on the western and eastern origin, while the most part of sylvestris individuals were grouped according to their region of origin  <cit> , e.g. kvetari’s, nakhiduri’s and ninotsminda’s.

the utskveti variety, a cultivar clustering very distinct from the other ones, was interesting, as well as tika kartkis variety, grouped together with ramishvili wild individuals. the utskveti variety was originated and widely spread in the past years in racha province  <cit> , but recently is only maintained in collections. the name of this variety was mentioned in the list of georgian local varieties  <cit>  and the ampelographic description has been available since  <dig>  <cit> . it is a white berry wine grape variety with strong hairs on lower leaf surface and with very dense bunches. the phenotypical observation of utskveti accessions in the available kindzmarauli, telavi and saguramo collections were only partially in agreement with the bibliography. nowadays, the accessions have white berry and dense bunches but hairless lower leaf surface. thus, some doubts about the correspondence of these accessions with historical utskveti grape have to be accounted.

in the grapevine germplasm collections of georgia are preserved two genotypes called tita kartlis. one is the true-to-type georgian cultivar tita kartlis, having deeply lobed leaf and small prolonged berries  <cit>  and the other genotype is the azerbaijani cultivar tabrizi, known in georgia with synonym name of ganjuri, differing from the tita kartlis true-to-type because of less lobed leaves, prolonged but larger berries and teeth in the petiole sinus  <cit> . since the ampelographic description of the analysed accession in this study corresponds to the description reported in ampelography of georgia  <cit> , the identification of tita kartlis is not questionable.

taking into account that the southern caucasus  has been considered the first centre of grapevine domestication  <cit> , the existence of local cultivars presenting morphological and genetic traits similar to wild individuals could be an instance of hybridization and introgression events among wild and domesticated accessions. those events due to pollen flow between cultivars and wild forms were previously proved  <cit>  and could have severe consequences in the conservation of wild grapevine populations and advance the doubt if the current wild populations fit the ancestral grapevine forms  <cit> . moreover, there are signs that only few georgian cultivars could correspond to stocks introduced in the past from other neighbouring regions or far away countries, as france  <cit> . despite the clear distinction between sativa and sylvestris compartments, few wild samples clusterized together with the cultivated samples. it is the case of ramishvili samples, two grouped in the sativa cluster and three in the group of samples clusterized as outgroup. the ramishvili samples have been collected by professor revaz ramishvili during his survey around georgia in order to collect and study wildly growing grapevines. during this survey, not only wild grapes v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris were collected, but also accessions discovered in wild conditions during his expeditions and showing a phenotype holding typical ampelographic traits  of both sylvestris and sativa subspecies  <cit> . based on cluster analysis, ramishvili  <dig> and ramishvili  <dig> could be considered cultivars because of their grouping in the dendrogram . regarding the accession ramishvili  <dig>  we do not have information about the flower sex, but we know it has white berries and we could conclude that it is not likely a v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris  <cit> . the accession ramishvili  <dig> is hermaphrodite, whereby we could exclude its wild nature and classify it in the domestic compartment, as well as the accession called ramishvili  <dig>  having a female flower but not a wild habitus.

the identification of two well distinct clusters for georgian samples were consistent with the high genetic variability and the genetic diversity of caucasus germplasm coming from georgia, considered a primary centre of grapevine domestication  <cit> . the high polymorphism of georgian grapevines was also discovered by morphological characterization of sylvestris populations  <cit> .

the two main groups obtained by cluster analysis were confirmed by nei’s genetic distance value , that it reflected the 87 % of similarity between the sativa and sylvestris clusters. this evidence was in agreement with the gene flow between the wild and cultivated compartments  <cit> . on the other hand, the fst value, accounting  <dig> , meant that the two groups have a moderate differentiation based on the interpretation suggested by wright  <cit> . this interpretation did not fit the low level of genetic differentiation between georgian wild and cultivated grapevines revealed by using a moderate number of microsatellite loci  <cit>  or between eastern sativa and sylvestris accessions analysed by 9 k snp loci  <cit> . the latter discrepancy could be due to the absence of georgian cultivars and the restricted number of georgian wild individuals in the dataset.

significant fst values of genetic differentiation  have been reported between grapevine accessions of sylvestris and sativa in morocco  <cit>  and in spain  <cit> .

in agreement with the cluster analysis, the pcoa performed to identify the potential correlations among populations, revealed three main groups: c <dig>  c <dig> and w <dig> . similar results, a clear distinction between sativa and sylvestris compartments, were also found analysing the northern african germplasm by  <dig> nuclear microsatellites  <cit> . a differentiation of two separate clusters among georgian cultivated samples was showed, confirming the existence of two genetic groups within the georgian sativa germplasm, following the geographical provenience in the georgian country described in  <cit>  and  <cit> , based on the molecular and morphological characterization, respectively. the samples collected in the eastern regions of georgia appeared separate from the accessions collected in the southern and western regions due to the orography and river basins functioned as biological boundaries. the overlapping area between c <dig> and w <dig> groups, slightly flattening the differentiation of cultivated and wild germplasm, was consistent with nei’s genetic distance value obtained between sativa and sylvestris compartments and the discrete degree of similarity between the sativa and sylvestris subspecies  <cit> , pointing out the existence of gene flow between both compartments  <cit> . based on this evidence, it could be advanced the hypothesis of existing intermediate genotypes, having ampelographic characteristics inherited by both sativa and sylvestris subspecies, due to potential domestication events occurred in the past years in this area. indeed, ramishvili accessions could support this hypothesis: ramishvili  <dig> was placed in between the c <dig> and w <dig> groups and ramishvili  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> accessions, considered sativa samples based on cluster analysis, in the pcoa plot belonged to w <dig>  as well as, the clustering of six cultivars  in the w <dig> group led us to suppose that these cultivars were derived from local domestication events of sylvestris individuals. contrary to what has been observed in this work, asuretuli shavi, a black berried female variety from the southern georgia , was identified as a case of doubtful georgian origin, because of based on ssr genotyping it showed a po relationship with the ancient greek variety rhoditis  <cit> . likewise the cluster analysis, ramishvili  <dig> accession was grouped in one of the two sativa groups . while utskveti, the cultivars showing the highest genetic diversity in respect to the entire set of samples, was placed in the overlapping zone between c <dig> and w <dig>  furthermore, the distance between sylvestris sites and vineyards appeared to do not influence the overlapping area.

in addition to the major partition in cultivated and wild groups, structure analysis identified three significant genetic groups, g <dig>  including the majority of cultivars coming from western region, g <dig>  clustering sativa samples with predominance of cultivars coming from eastern georgia and g <dig>  the group consistent with the wild accessions . the structure results, with 68 % of accessions clearly assigned to one group, recognized the genetic structure of georgian germplasm , while the existence of samples showing an unclear assignation  could reflect the events of genetic introgression between wine-growing areas of georgia. considering the putative wild individuals analysed in this study,  <dig> out of  <dig> samples showed a percentage of assignation higher than 95 %, leading us to hypothesize that these wild individuals could be considered ancestral grapevine forms. indeed, the accessions belonging to ramishvili group were mostly included in g <dig> and g <dig>  and the other ones showed about 34 % of assignation to the eastern georgia group. the same six cultivars grouped into the w <dig> of pcoa plot were included in g <dig> and showed a not negligible percentage of assignation to g <dig>  the pairwise fst values higher than  <dig>  among g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> subpopulations revealed a moderate differentiation and the relatedness between eastern and sylvestris individuals groups was confirmed by fst lower value for g2-g <dig> pairwise. these results suggested that domestication events occurred in this geographic area as well as identified in  <cit> , where the structure analysis, carried out on georgian and wild accessions, revealed admixture among cultivated and wild samples, but a clustering regardless of their collection region was observed.

archaeological evidence suggests that the grapevine domestication took place in south caucasus and that its spread followed successive scenarios: the first one from caucasus toward south-west , the second one toward anatolia and after on the way to greece, balkans, sicily, southern italy, france and spain and the last one from france to central europe  <cit> . moreover, secondary centres of domestication have been proposed, as well as iberian peninsula, where it was found the chlorotypes of sylvestris and sativa genotypes compatible with western cultivars chlorotypes  <cit> , and italy, where the allelic profile of some cultivars was found very similar to some wild accessions  <cit> .

even though a connection between some sylvestris and sativa individuals was highlighted by both multivariate and structure analysis, the kingship analysis did not find out close relationship between wild and cultivated samples, because of ramishvili  <dig>  showing a po relationship with tita kartlis, is now considered a sativa individual. nevertheless, if introgression events occurred between the two subspecies and parental individuals were not analysed, the parentage relationships higher than 2nd degree are difficult to identify. moreover, it cannot be excluded that close relationship could be discovered between two subspecies enlarging the number of analysed accessions. the 1st degree relationship between two wild samples , located in sites not far from each other is consistent with propagation events by seed dispersal  <cit>  and confirmed the inbreeding tendency in some wild populations.

in a time characterized by great challenges to face climatic change and to develop sustainable agricultural models based on use of moderate irrigation, fertilisation and pesticides, the selection of new genotypes for ensuring an optimal productivity in terms of quality and quantity is mandatory. it was demonstrated that the georgian grapes are late ripening cultivars, characterized by a long vegetative and reproductive development  in comparison with western european cultivars  <cit> . the objective to select varieties showing a wider range of phenological variability and genetic traits, apparently not represented in the germplasm of western europe, makes the georgian varieties a considerable background for grapevine breeding programs aimed to extend the ripening time in a viticultural area and consequently reducing possible berry summer stresses and grapes quality impairment.

considering the grapevine defence against diseases, a survey about use of fungicides in member states of the european union highlighted that viticulture accounts for approximately 70 % of all agrochemicals used. nevertheless, an intensive use of chemicals becomes more and more unsustainable because of high costs, and possible negative impact on environment and human health due to the chemical residues in grapes, soil and aquifers. the eu directive 2009/ <dig> for sustainable control of diseases caused by plant pathogens in europe strongly recommends a decrease in the number of pesticide treatments carried out in the field. thus, following the first interesting results obtained by screening the caucasian germplasm  <cit> , a systematic investigation of georgian grapevine genetic resources, searching for resistant traits to pathogen, seems to be a promising strategy for plant breeding programs aimed to reduce the fungicides use in vineyard assuring at the same time an acceptable protection against pathogens.

snp and ssr molecular markers in comparison
vitis18ksnp array is the largest snps set implemented in a high-throughput genotyping technology for genetic diversity in grapevine. the previously snps sets included tens  <cit> , hundreds  <cit>  or thousands loci  <cit> . snp platforms have been developed following the huge genomic data obtained by sequencing and re-sequencing of whole genomes using ngs technology on accelerated pace, which allow high-throughput and low cost genotyping of thousands of markers in parallel.

on the other side, ssr markers are a useful instrument widely used for genotyping, to solve problems of homonymies, synonymies and kinships, to infer genetic structure of populations in wild and cultivated grapevines  <cit> . a set of  <dig> ssr markers was proposed as minimal set of loci for genotyping routine analysis  <cit>  and for parentage analysis or for germplasms not covered by this set an additional group of  <dig> ssr loci was included  <cit> .

in this work, it was demonstrated that the snp markers were useful for germplasm management, as already observed in grapevine  <cit>  and in many other species  <cit>  and that the results could be compared to other marker systems, as the traditional ssr  <cit> . moreover, snp markers revealed a higher differentiation, pointing out a moderate differentiation between sativa and sylvestris compartments based on fst value, and at the population level the high number of loci should solve better the genetic relationship among samples. in respect to ssr markers, these microarray-based markers were used to investigate helpfully the genetic diversity of georgian sativa and sylvestris germplasms with a limited expense in terms of time and money and obtaining a high data reliability . moreover, since the snps are biallelic the genetic profiles could be easily compared to datasets generated by other laboratories around the world, without incurring problems related to difficulty on data standardization  <cit> .

another winning aspect could be the application of vitis18ksnp array for parentage analysis. nowadays, the parentage analysis works are carried out including dozens of ssr loci  <cit>  and, sometimes, even by increasing the number of analysed loci not all the relationships discovered previously can be ruled in  <cit> . an in-deeper analysis, using thousands of snp loci, could strengthen the data obtained by kinship analysis, mostly for second and third-degree relatives, for which more than  <dig> ssr loci should be investigated for the detection  <cit> .

furthermore, this array could successfully be chosen for the construction of high-density maps, quantitative trait loci  mapping, genetic diversity and parentage analysis in grapevine.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained by molecular analysis of georgian germplasm using a large set of snp markers provided information of high genetic diversity of sativa and sylvestris georgian germplasms, as previously investigated by other molecular markers and by morphological evaluations. our data showed that the vitis18ksnp assay can be used successfully for high-throughput snp genotyping in grapevine and represented a viable alternative to traditional genotyping techniques. according to this work, a moderate differentiation between sativa and sylvestris compartments was discovered, due to centuries long separation of two taxa, making it quite impossible to trace the events of v. vinifera domestication. on the other hand, connection between samples of both subspecies may be assumed as well, highlighting the occurrence of cross hybridization events among native wild populations and cultivars.
