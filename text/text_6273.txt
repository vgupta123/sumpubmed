BACKGROUND
poxviruses are unique among dna viruses in that their entire life cycle, including dna replication, occurs exclusively within the cytoplasm of the host cell. therefore, the virus does not depend on cellular nuclear functions, and relies largely on its own gene products for dna replication, transcription and virion assembly. proteins required for dna replication of poxvirus are thereby expressed early in infection.

vaccinia virus, the best characterized member of the orthopoxvirus family, is used as the smallpox vaccine. its genome of ~ <dig> kb encodes more than  <dig> proteins that are highly conserved among poxviruses. the uracil-dna glycosylase , encoded by the d <dig> open-reading frame , is essential for viral replication. uracil residues are introduced into dna either through misincorporation of dutp by dna polymerase or through deamination of cytosine. in general, udgs catalyze the first step in the base excision repair pathway and remove uracil residues from dna by cleaving the glycosidic bond, resulting in an apyrimidinic  site. however, in poxvirus udg activity is rapidly induced following infection, suggesting that the enzyme is required prior to and during dna synthesis  <cit> . two observations have indicated the involvement of vvudg in dna replication. the virus cannot replicate in the absence of udg  <cit> , and two temperature-sensitive  mutations conferring defective dna replication map to the d <dig> orf  <cit> . the first ts mutant, dts <dig> , containing a g179r substitution was partially impaired both in virus production and dna replication at the permissive temperature  while it displayed a strong dna- phenotype at the non-permissive temperature   <cit> . the second ts mutant, dts <dig> , containing a l110f substitution showed normal levels of dna synthesis and virus production at  <dig> °c but dna synthesis was essentially blocked at  <dig> °c  <cit> . additional support for the involvement of vvudg in viral replication comes from the discovery that vvudg interacts with another viral protein, a <dig> and forms the processivity factor  <cit> . the udg:a <dig> complex  binds to e <dig>  to assemble the processive dna polymerase holoenzyme . the protein-protein interaction between udg and a <dig> is essential for viral replication. however, this interaction does not depend on the glycosylase activity or the presence of the catalytic residues in udg  <cit> . the interaction site on a <dig> has been mapped to its n-terminal  <dig> residues  <cit>  but the a <dig> binding site on udg is not known.

the vvudg enzyme is highly specific for uracil and preferentially excises uracil when present in single stranded dna . although viral udg has a stronger affinity for ssdna  than the human enzyme , the excision efficiency of the human enzyme was several orders of magnitude higher  <cit> . in the absence of mgcl <dig> vaccinia virus and human nuclear udg have comparable activity, but vvudg is strongly inhibited in the presence of mgcl <dig>  while the human nuclear udg shows markedly enhanced activity. in addition, while the human enzyme is strongly inhibited by the uracil-dna glycosylase inhibitor protein  from bacillus subtilis bacteriophages pbs <dig> and pbs <dig>  vvudg shows no inhibition. overall the enzymatic properties of vvudg differ from the human enzymes suggesting a different mechanism of action. moreover, poxvirus udgs exhibit low sequence identity to other udgs. therefore, vvudg may offer a potential target for specific inhibitors.

here, we describe the crystal structure of vvudg in two different crystal forms, and provide a comparison with the most studied known udg structures . these structures provide the first glimpse of a poxvirus udg and show unique features that distinguish the enzyme from all other members of the udg protein family.

RESULTS
vvudg plays an essential role in viral replication as a component of the dna polymerase processivity factor. the enzyme diverged significantly from udgs of other species in its primary, secondary and tertiary structure, and through modifications of otherwise conserved active site motifs.

vvudg is a single-domain protein with  <dig> amino acids. results of size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering showed that in solution recombinant vvudg exists as a dimer of an estimated molecular weight of  <dig> kda.

udgs of various members within the poxvirus family show a high degree of sequence homology. udgs from the variola  virus and vaccinia virus differ only in  <dig> positions. among all poxviruses, fowlpox udg has the lowest sequence identity  with vvudg. on the other hand, sequence identity to udgs from organisms outside the poxvirus family is only about 20%.

structure determination and quality
we have determined the crystal structure of recombinant vvudg by siras phasing in trigonal space group p <dig>  the structure was refined to an r value of  <dig> %  at  <dig>  Å resolution . the recombinant protein used for crystallization contained an n-terminal his-tag. the final model consists of two subunits a and b with a total number of  <dig> protein residues ,  <dig> chloride and  <dig> sulfate ion,  <dig> water,  <dig> glycerol  and  <dig> imidazole  molecules. parts of the n-terminal his-tag are visible in both subunits, a  and b . several residues in two loop regions could not be fitted into the electron density in each subunit  presumably due to disorder. in addition, some residues have truncated side chain density in both subunits .  <dig> residues in subunit b  show alternate conformations. the ramachandran plot shows  <dig> % of all protein residues in the allowed regions, with  <dig> residues  in generously allowed and  <dig> residues  in disallowed regions. electron density for several of the residues in generously allowed regions  and the two residues in the disallowed region  is good. of these residues a <dig> and y <dig> are part of a β-hairpin turn connecting strands  <dig> and  <dig>  n <dig> is in the turn following helix  <dig>  in the c-terminal part of the protein. refinement statistics are shown in table  <dig>

we also crystallized vvudg  in orthorhombic space group p <dig>  this structure was determined by molecular replacement using the refined model of the trigonal crystal form, and was refined to an r value of  <dig> %  at  <dig>  Å resolution . the final model consists of  <dig> subunits a through h with a total number of  <dig> residues ,  <dig> chloride ion,  <dig> water,  <dig> hepes  and  <dig> glycerol  molecules. several residues in the same two loop regions could not be fitted into the electron density in each subunit  and are missing from the final model. the ramachandran plot shows  <dig> % of all protein residues in allowed regions, while  <dig> % of the residues are found in generously allowed and  <dig> %  in disallowed regions. here, the same residues  with good electron density as mentioned for the trigonal crystal form are also found in generously allowed and disallowed regions. refinement statistics are shown in table  <dig>  the average rms deviation for all cα atoms between subunits of the two different crystal forms is ~ <dig>  Å.

overall polypeptide fold
the overall structure of the vvudg protein in both crystal forms is similar. vvudg adopts an α/β fold described as dna glycosylase fold in the scop database  <cit>  that is composed of a parallel β-sheet of  <dig> strands  with  <dig> layers of α/β/α. in fig.  <dig> the secondary structure assignments and topology diagrams for vvudg are compared with those for human udg. in vvudg the central β-sheet is surrounded on either side by a total of  <dig> larger helices. two helices are observed on one side , and three helices on the other side . additional features are seen at each terminus. at the n-terminus the vvudg structure exhibits a β-sheet made up of two anti-parallel β-strands . at the c-terminus the polypeptide chain folds back to form another small anti-parallel β-sheet  and displays the pairing of two small helices . the active site groove is visible at the c-terminal edge of the central parallel β-sheet. active site residues d <dig>  y <dig>  f <dig>  n <dig> and h <dig> are lined up at the edge of the groove. the tertiary structure of a vvudg subunit is shown in fig. 2a.

assembly and protein-protein interactions
the asymmetric unit in trigonal space group p <dig> contains a dimer  with subunits a and b related by non-crystallographic symmetry two-fold symmetry . this ncs related dimer is shown in fig. 2b. the total buried solvent accessible surface area  is approximately 4%, corresponding to an interface area of  <dig> Å  <dig> between individual subunits. analysis of protein-protein interactions was performed using the proface server  <cit> . in each subunit there are  <dig> interface residues. for subunit b the contact area is confined to the n-terminal residues 1– <dig>   <dig>  9– <dig> and  <dig>  and residues  <dig>  45– <dig> and  <dig>  for subunit a most of the interface residues are found in two regions  with a few additional residues at the termini .

the packing of vvudg in the unit cell of the trigonal form gives rise to a second type of dimer  formed by subunits that are related by crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. the buried surface area in these dimers amounts to  <dig> –7% of the total sasa, corresponding to an interface area of  <dig> Å  <dig> between individual subunits. this type ii dimer interface has 16– <dig> residues  from each subunit. the contact residues are in the large conserved c-terminal helix  <dig>  the loop  connecting strands  <dig> and  <dig> and in strand  <dig>  since strand  <dig> is part of a conserved parallel β-sheet in the central core, interactions involving this strand extend the four-stranded β-sheet to an anti-parallel eight-stranded β-sheet in the dimer. this type ii dimer is also observed in the orthorhombic space group p <dig> , and is likely the physiological dimer observed in solution. in the orthorhombic crystal form, subunits a through h in the asymmetric unit are arranged as four dimers related by non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry . based on the subunit-subunit interactions these dimers are of type ii as seen in the trigonal crystal form.

considering that vvudg is a dimer in solution  the dimeric assembly in both crystal forms is unlikely to be an artifact of crystal packing. the protein-protein interactions in the dimers may be important in fulfilling vvudg's role as a component of the dna polymerase processivity factor. it is tempting to speculate that the interactions in the type i dimer only seen in the trigonal crystal form might mimic the interaction between udg and a <dig> in the heterodimeric complex  while the other set of interactions hold the homodimeric assembly of vvudg.

active site
vvudg was crystallized in the absence of any substrate. glycerol molecules from either the crystallization solution or the cryoprotecting reagent occupied the active site in both crystal forms. the quality of electron density for the active site residues and the glycerol molecules is excellent in each case . glycerol is an inhibitor of udg and kinetic studies showed that  <dig> mm glycerol inhibited the reaction rate of e. coli udg by ~50%  <cit> . a glycerol molecule  was located in the uracil binding pocket in the crystal structure of e. coli udg  <cit> . in this structure the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol mimicked atoms o <dig>  o <dig>  and n <dig> of uracil  in their interaction with the enzyme. glycerol forms hydrogen bonds directly or through water molecules with active site residues . in the vvudg trigonal crystal form, one glycerol molecule is located in the active site of subunit b and occupies the same position as seen in e. coli udg . this glycerol makes interactions with three of the five active site residues  and their immediate neighbors . in subunit a an imidazole molecule occupies the active site making interactions with d <dig> and displaying hydrophobic contacts with f <dig>  the chloride ion  in subunit a shows distances of  <dig> – <dig>  Å to backbone nitrogen atoms of active site residues y <dig> and f <dig> and the nd <dig> atom of n <dig>  in subunits a, c, e and g of the orthorhombic crystal form one glycerol molecule is located in each active site and exhibits similar interactions with active site residues d <dig>  y <dig>  f <dig> and n <dig> as described for subunit b of the trigonal crystal form. details of the contacts involving these ligands in both crystal forms are listed in table  <dig> 

in both crystal forms additional glycerol molecules are located away from the active site. contacts formed by non-active site glycerol molecules and other ligands are provided in additional file  <dig> 

variations in active site motifs
the vvudg sequence exhibits considerable differences in the characteristic motifs utilized by other udgs for recognizing and flipping the uracil moiety in the substrate dna during the catalytic activity . the vvudg has five of the six conserved active site residues , but lacks the conserved leu residue . in other udgs the leu residue is part of the 'leu intercalation loop', which has the characteristic motif . the 'intercalation loop'  is substantially altered in poxvirus udgs . only  <dig> residues  match with residues in human and e. coli udg. residue r <dig> in vvudg corresponds to l <dig> in e. coli udg .

uracil dna glycosylase catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the n-glycosidic bond of premutagenic uracil residues in dna by base flipping. results from a study by drohat et al.  <cit>  in e. coli support a mechanism for catalysis that emphasizes catalytic residue asp <dig> as the general base activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack at c1' of the deoxyribose, and catalytic residue his <dig> as a neutral electrophile, stabilizing a developing negative charge on uracil atom o <dig> in the transition state. stivers et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that base flipping contributes little to the free energy of dna binding but provides a substantial contribution to specificity through an induced-fit mechanism. for the binding of dna substrates udg uses a number of residues that are not part of the active site  <cit> . according to tainer et al.  <cit>  the dna repair mechanism of udg involves pinching of the phosphodiester backbone of damaged dna using hydroxyl side chains of four conserved serine residues . this results in flipping of the deoxyuridine from the dna helix into the enzyme active site. these authors propose that strain induced by serine pinching is used to lower the activation barrier for glycosidic bond cleavage. results based on s88a, s189a, and s192g "pinching" mutations described by werner et al.  <cit>  indicated a role for these serine-phosphodiester interactions in uracil flipping and preorganization of the sugar ring into a reactive conformation. the 'pro-rich' and 'gly-ser' loops that contain ser residues in other udgs are missing in vvudg. in addition, the two ser residues are also missing from the 'leu intercalation loop' . in the pinch-push-pull uracil detection mechanism, the conserved leu residue of the 'leu intercalation loop' penetrates into the dna minor groove to push the uracil base into the active-site pocket. based on the structure of the l272a complex of human udg with dna, the l <dig> side chain push is not essential for nucleotide flipping, although it plays a key role in efficient activity  <cit> . results of another study  <cit>  suggest that the leu residue within the -hpspls-motif is crucial for the uracil excision activity of udg.

the side chain of this conserved leu residue in udg is also inserted into the hydrophobic cavity of the specific uracil-dna glycosylase inhibitor  from bacillus subtilis  <cit> . putnam et al.  <cit>  pointed out that a significant fraction of the buried surface area  in the ugi-complex results from the complementarity between the conserved leu residue and the ugi hydrophobic cavity. poxvirus udgs contain instead an arg residue at this position in the 'leu intercalation loop' . it was shown that vvudg activity is not inhibited by ugi  <cit> . superimposition of vvudg with e. coli udg in the e. coli udg-ugi inhibitor complex  provides a possible explanation for the lack of inhibition . size and electrostatic property of the arg residue are incompatible with insertion into the hydrophobic cavity of ugi.

since the conserved leu residue and the 'leu intercalation loop' are critical components for the conventional udg catalytic mechanism, poxvirus udgs may utilize a different yet unknown reaction mechanism for carrying out the dna repair activity.

the conserved motif for uracil specificity  in udgs is also altered in the vvudg protein . only n <dig> as part of the active site residues is conserved. nonetheless, poxvirus udg is still highly specific for uracil and does not act on other modified bases  <cit> . in addition, the 'catalytic water-activating loop' is different in vvudg. this loop  shows two changes compared to the conserved motif .

discussion of the temperature-sensitive mutants 
two temperature sensitive mutants, which were mapped to the d <dig> orf by ellison et al.  <cit> , have been described. of these, dts <dig> , is of particular interest since this mutation confers defective dna replication and demonstrates a reduced ability of the mutant d <dig> protein to interact with a <dig>  residue g <dig> is the c-terminal residue of strand  <dig> in the central parallel β-sheet. as shown in fig.  <dig> the substitution of g <dig> residue by an arg residue  would force a large basic residue into the hydrophobic pocket made up of residues y <dig>  i <dig>  f <dig> and i <dig>  y <dig> is part of the preceding strand  <dig>  i <dig> is part of strand  <dig>  while f <dig> and i <dig> belong to helix  <dig> following strand  <dig>  accommodating the side chain of arg <dig> will require considerable structural rearrangement. it is likely, although speculative, that the mutation leads to a rearrangement of secondary structure elements  at and close to the c-terminus to accommodate this residue, which in turn might interfere with binding to a <dig> and the formation of the a20:udg processivity factor. another possibility is a destabilizing effect of this mutation by modulating the dimer interface resulting in a potential interference with the dimer formation.

the other temperature-sensitive mutation, dts <dig>  creates a l110f substitution. although this residue points into a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues f <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig> and y <dig>  the bulky aromatic side chain of the mutated residue is expected to cause steric hindrance and disrupt the local environment as shown in the model in fig.  <dig> 

structural comparison to other udg structures
vvudg shows ~20% sequence identity with e. coli and human udgs. sequence homology with herpes simplex virus <dig>  udg is also in the same range . the structural homology between these proteins is low . on the other hand, hsv <dig> udg is very similar to human udg and e. coli udg in terms of sequence , fold  and characteristic motifs  <cit> .

the core of the vvudg structure, however, is similar to other udgs. the conserved four-stranded central parallel β-sheet, a small second β-sheet made from two anti-parallel β-strands, and six helices in the vvudg structure match with the observed topology in e. coli and human udg . superimposition of the vvudg structure with e. coli udg  using program topp  <cit>  revealed an rms deviation of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα atoms in the matching secondary structure elements . the superimposition with human udg  gave an rms deviation of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα atoms in the matching secondary structure elements . the vvudg structure shows some new features that are unique among known udg structures as discussed earlier and shown in fig.  <dig>  compared to vvudg the c-termini in e. coli  <cit>  and human  <cit>  udg do not show any well defined secondary structure. other structural differences of vvudg to e. coli and human udg include fewer α-helices surrounding the central β-sheet, a distinct bend of the n-terminal helix , some tighter turns in loop regions and the movement of c-terminal residues in strands  <dig> and  <dig>  these two strands are shifted towards the center of the parallel β-sheet with respect to the other two structures.

a structure-based alignment of udg sequences that included also the vvudg sequence  <cit>  demonstrates the pitfalls of this approach when the sequence identity drops to about 20%. the new features especially at the termini are not recognized, and the corresponding residues in the viral sequence are instead lined up with the previously observed conserved secondary structure elements in udgs of other species. it is intuitive that the described novel features in the vaccinia virus udg structure play a role in the unique function of poxvirus udg in replication.

a plausible model for the function of poxvirus udg as part of the processivity factor is shown in fig.  <dig>  the model shows two dimers arranged around a central channel in a homotetrameric arrangement that is observed in both crystal structures . a similar molecular assembly has been noticed in previously studied sliding clamps  <cit> . the diameter of the central channel in vvudg is approximately  <dig> Å . this compares well with diameters in the heterotrimeric sliding clamp of pcna  in sulfolobus solfataricus  and the homodimeric sliding clamp of the polymerase β-subunit in e. coli  that are ~ <dig> Å and 30– <dig> Å, respectively. however, the central channel must have sufficient flexibility in order to accommodate various binding components. in this analogy a <dig>  which acts as a scaffold with binding regions for udg, e <dig> and other factors such as d <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> , would seem to function as a clamp loader. protein regions at the type i dimer interface only observed in the trigonal crystal form may be involved in the binding of a <dig>  a part of this dimer interface includes n-terminal residues 1– <dig> and c-terminal udg residues 208– <dig>  these  <dig> residues are almost exclusively hydrophobic. interestingly, the n-terminal  <dig> residues of a <dig> that constitute the minimal interacting binding site for udg are also predominantly hydrophobic. a hydrophobic interaction in the proposed binding surface is consistent with the observed stability of the heterodimeric a20:udg complex at high ionic strength   <cit> . although previous experiments have suggested a 1: <dig> stoichiometry of binding between a <dig> and udg  <cit> , the true composition of a functional polymerase unit remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, vaccinia virus udg is the only known dimeric protein of this class. we propose that the observed molecular assembly may be related to its cellular functions, which include its role in dna repair and interaction with one or more binding partners. these interactions are essential to the formation of the processive dna polymerase needed for the replication of the virus. discovering tools to disrupt these associations will have tremendous impact in the field of antiviral therapy of poxvirus infection. the structures described here offer a framework for future investigations into the structure of the polymerase complex.
