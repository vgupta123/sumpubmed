BACKGROUND
domestication of soybean
soybean  is a remarkable plant, producing both high quality oil and protein and is one of the primary row crops in the united states. although soybean is relatively new to western agriculture, it has been under cultivation for >  <dig> years  <cit> . the transition from wild glycine soja to cultivated glycine max was the result of ancient plant breeders/farmers selecting for a large number of domestication-specific traits . dramatic changes in seed oil/protein content and fatty acid composition have apparently also been selected for during domestication, either directly or indirectly  <cit> .

genetics of soybean seed coloration
the visual appearance of the soybean seed itself has also been altered as a result of domestication: all glycine soja accessions in the usda grin germplasm collection possess black seed coats, whereas the majority of glycine max germplasm  possess yellow seed coats. although a small market exists for black soybeans, all modern high yielding cultivars feature yellow seed coats, with a range of hila colors present . cultivars with pale hila are highly prized for natto and tofu production  <cit> . because hilum coloration is controlled by a small number of genes  <cit> , this trait is frequently used by breeders as a readily assayed visible marker for the presence of "off-types" in soybean seed lots. seed coat and hilum color are relatively simple epistatic multi-genic traits, and variation in hilum and seed coat pigmentation appears to be due to the interaction of four independent loci: inhibitor , tawny , an unnamed locus termed r, and the flower color locus w <dig>  <cit> . other loci with minor effects have been described, but these have not been mapped and the genetics have been incompletely discerned  <cit> .

the compounds responsible for soybean seed coat and hilum color in soybean are derivatives of phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit>  . the wild type condition of black seed coats is primarily due to two anthocyanidin glycosides : cyanidin-3-monoglucoside and delphinidin-3-monoglucoside  <cit> . in lines which feature brown seed coats, only cyanidin is apparently present at maturity  <cit> . aside from the cosmetic and aesthetic aspect of coloration, anthocyanins are thought to have diverse human health promoting capabilities  <cit> .

the action of udp-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase enzymes is a critical step in anthocyanin accumulation
two anthocyanin glycosides form the predominant colored compounds in black seed coats: cyanidin-3-monoglucoside and delphinidin-3-monoglucoside  <cit> . these are formed through the action of udp-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase  enzymes, which specifically transfer a glucose moiety from utp to the 3' position of cyanidin and delphinidin . this glycosylation is thought to increase the stability and solubility of the cyanidin molecule  <cit> . in lines with brown seed coats , cyanidin accumulates, though high levels of proanthocyanidins are also present  <cit> . recently, two highly similar co-expressed uf3gt genes  were determined to be expressed in seed coats of black seeded soybean lines, and these genes have been demonstrated to specifically transfer a glucose moiety to the cyanidin molecule at the 3'-hydroxyl group, resulting in the formation of cyanidin-3-glucoside  <cit> .

the inhibitor locus
seed coat color is primarily under control of the inhibitor locus, which has at least four classically defined genetic alleles  <cit> , listed here from the most dominant to the least: i  >ii  >ik  >i . inhibitor acts in a dominant, gain-of-function manner with maternal-effect inheritance, and results in seed coats appearing pale yellow due to the absence of anthocyanins  <cit> . both the dominant inhibitor allele  and the ii alleles have been shown to be due to naturally occurring, gene-silencing effects derived from linked but independent chalcone synthase  gene clusters  that generate sirna which target chs gene transcripts specifically within the seed coat for degradation  <cit> .

the genetics of soybean hilum coloration
lines which have the dominant i allele can still exhibit some traces of color within the hilum, with the specific hilum coloration due to the allelic status at three other genetic loci: tawny, r, and w <dig>  <cit>  . hilum tissue is not maternally-derived, in contrast to the seed coat  <cit> . in lines with the recessive  allele, seed coat color is brown, imperfect black, buff or black, dependent on the allelic status of the tawny, r and w <dig> loci .

the tawny locus has two pleiotropic effects: homozygosity for the gray  allele results in gray pubescence at maturity and, in lines carrying the combination of the ii allele of the inhibitor locus, a functional r gene, and purple flowers , seed which feature "imperfect black" hila . alternatively, gray pubescent  lines carrying the ii allele of the inhibitor locus, a functional or nonfunctional r, and white flowers  produce seed which feature buff hila  <cit>  . the phenotypic effects of the recessive allele of tawny have been discerned to be due to loss of function mutations affecting a flavonoid 3' hydroxylase gene   <cit> . at the chemical level, this is the result of a reduction in the accumulation of anthocyanins within the hilum, and the presence of pelargonidin , which does not accumulate in lines carrying the wild type version of the tawny locus  <cit> .

the recessive allele of the r locus is responsible for brown hilum/seed coats
another locus, classically termed r, also interacts epistatically with the tawny and inhibitor loci  to control hilum and seed coat colors  <cit>  . lines with a functional tawny gene and homozygous for the recessive allele of the r locus possess either brown seed coats or brown hilum, dependent on the allelic status of the inhibitor locus . although the genetics behind this trait were well resolved shortly after the rediscovery of mendel's work in the 1920s  <cit> , the molecular genetic basis has not been ascertained. despite this, the ease of phenotyping has resulted in the inclusion of this locus in the development of genetic maps for soybean  <cit> .

epistasis for genes involved in soybean coloration
epistatic and pleiotropic interactions are the norm for genes involved in soybean coloration . for example, loss of function mutations affecting a flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase gene  have been demonstrated to result in two phenotypes: white flowers and loss of purple pigment in hypocotyls  <cit> . the allelic status of the w <dig> locus, when combined with the recessive gray allele of the tawny locus, determines if seed coats or hila are colored "imperfect black" or "buff"   <cit> .

approaches to identify the r locus, which results in brown hilum/seed coats
loss of function mutations affecting a gene involved in the terminal end of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway have been suggested as the cause of the recessive brown seed coat/hilum phenotype . possible candidates have included uf3gt, anthocyanidin synthase  and/or dihydroxyflavone reductase  genes. however, no correlation has been found between the genomic locations of any uf3gt, dfr or ans gene and the location of the r gene  <cit> . alternately, a transcription factor or other regulatory element could be responsible for the brown hilum/seed coat phenomenon. the objective of this work was to identify the specific gene and causative basis behind the phenomenon of brown hilum/seed coat coloration, historically defined as the r locus, in soybean.

methods
ril population development
the generation of the f <dig> ril mapping population, derived from a cross between jake x pi  <dig>  was previously described  <cit> . jake  has tawny pubescence, purple flowers, and shiny yellow seed with black hila  <cit> . the brown hila line, pi  <dig> has tawny pubescence, purple flowers, and yellow seed with brown hila  . the reference cultivar williams  <dig>  for which the genome sequence was determined  <cit> , has tawny pubescence, white flowers and yellow seed with black hila   <cit> .

bulk segregant analysis of selected ril lines
a total of  <dig> f <dig> ril lines were selected from a jake x pi  <dig> cross in which segregation for hilum color had occurred  and seed from each were pooled to form two bulks. only rils that were definitively black or brown were used in the bulks, with ambiguous or mixed rils not included. the seeds  were ground utilizing a coffee grinder to generate a fine powder. the grinder was cleaned thoroughly between grindings. dna was isolated using a dneasy plant maxi kit  according to manufacturer's recommendations. bulk dna was concentrated using standard ethanol precipitation procedure to yield a final concentration of  <dig>  micrograms ml- <dig>  or  <dig>  micrograms ml- <dig> . bulk dna was used with universal soybean linkage panel  as previously described  <cit> .

simple sequence repeat  markers
all ssr primer pairs from within the newly delimited r locus region, drawn from a bioinformatically defined list, were also examined for potential utility in fine-mapping  <cit> . fine mapping pcr was performed in  <dig> microliter reactions as previously described  <cit>  and pcr products were separated on 2% agarose gels. genotypic classes were assigned by visual comparison to pcr reactions using dna from parental lines. only those ssr primer pairs which showed obvious, easily scored size polymorphism between the two parents  were used in subsequent analysis. ssr primers pairs which displayed polymorphism within the newly defined r region, and which could theoretically be used to select for this trait, are listed in additional file  <dig> 

dna isolation, pcr and sequencing of candidate genes from pureline seed
dna was isolated using a dneasy plant mini kit , and 5- <dig> ng of dna were used in pcr with ex taq  with gene specific primers  under the following conditions: 95°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> seconds, 59°c for  <dig> seconds, and at 72°c for  <dig> minute per  <dig> kbp of predicted product size. following pcr, products were examined on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis and sent for sequencing at the university of missouri dna core facility. sequence traces were downloaded, imported into contig express model of the vectornti advance  <dig> software , assembled and manually evaluated for polymorphisms. putative polymorphisms were verified by a second, independent pcr and sequencing reaction.

selection of diverse lines from the germplasm repository
 <dig> lines were selected for sequencing of the putative r gene, drawn either from a previously established list of diverse germplasm  <cit>  or were individually selected from the usda grin germplasm collection  to ensure a broad geographic distribution with a range of hilum and seed coat colors. certain color classes were only minimally investigated, due to epistatic interactions which precluded novel information . a full listing of the  <dig> lines examined for the allelic status of the r gene/glyma09g <dig> is listed in additional file  <dig>  for a subset of ten lines, all three exons were examined by sequencing . these lines were: pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> b . because all mutations identified were found to affect the 1st or 2nd exons, we elected to only sequence the first and second exons  in the remaining  <dig> lines.

qrt-pcr
expression analysis on seed coat, cotyledon or leaf total rna ) was performed as described  <cit>  with minor modifications. the rt-pcr mix was supplemented with  <dig> x titanium taq polymerase  to improve primer efficiency. following the reverse transcriptase reaction, amplification was 95°c for  <dig> min, then  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> seconds, 60°c for  <dig> seconds, and 72°c for  <dig> seconds. primers used in this work are listed in additional file  <dig>  the reference gene used to normalize data was cons <dig>  <cit>  and raw ct values were first applied to efficiency curves developed for each primer set utilizing williams  <dig> genomic dna, then normalized to the expression of the reference gene and expressed as a percent of cons <dig> 

numerous researchers have reported reliable data from qrt-pcr utilizing rna from mature yellow seed coat tissue. however rt-pcr using rna derived from brown seed coat tissue was challenging, likely owing to the known effect of interference due to proanthocyanins  <cit> . the use of a simple pcr inhibitor removal column  remedied this difficulty, resulting in acceptable qrt-pcr data derived from mrna isolated from maturing brown seed coat tissue.

we also investigated chs7/ <dig> using a primer pair previously described  <cit> ; however the results were highly variable in both cotyledon and seed coat tissues with no significant expression level differences detected between the brown and black seed coat samples .

RESULTS
bulk segregant analysis
in order to identify the gene responsible for the r locus effect , we initially utilized the bulk segregant analysis   <cit>  method on rils from a population derived from the cross of soybean cultivar jake with the pi  <dig> which had segregated for the r gene alleles with the uslp array  <cit> . although this technique confirmed the previously identified location of the r locus  <cit> , the extremely broad window identified  failed to further delimit the boundaries of the r locus.

we then assayed a novel ssr set  <cit>  derived from bioinformatic analysis of the whole genome shotgun sequence  for williams  <dig> corresponding to the region containing the r locus. the use of dna from the two bulks with polymorphic markers allowed us to refine the r region to ~ <dig>  mbps as tightly linked to the locus responsible for brown hila .

all markers indicated are drawn from the recently described list of simple sequence repeat markers determined by bioinformatics analysis  <cit>  of the williams  <dig> whole genome shotgun sequence  <cit> .

identification of lines featuring recombination events within the delimited r region
three primer pairs from the novel ssr set . we examined these seven rils using all novel polymorphic ssrs markers within this region, and compared the marker genotype to the ril phenotype . our methodology allowed us to fine-map the location of the r gene to a predicted region of less than  <dig> kbp with only  <dig> ril lines. this region in williams  <dig> contains  <dig> predicted open reading frames, with another  <dig> genes annotated as pseudogenes .

identification of four r2r <dig> myb genes as candidates for the r locus
blast searches using the  <dig> candidate genes were performed against ncbi  and tair  databases to search for candidate genes. blast searches revealed four tandem genes which featured homology to the r2r <dig> myb transcription factor gene family: glyma09g <dig>  glyma09g <dig>  09g <dig> and glyma09g <dig>  r2r <dig> myb genes have been shown to control flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway, and mutants in multiple species are associated with changes in fruit, flower and/or seed color . these four tandem r2r <dig> myb genes are highly similar  and may have arisen due to a tandem gene amplification event. strikingly, none of these genes appears to have been identified in recent seed focused studies using rnaseq methods  <cit> .

expression analysis of r2r <dig> gene candidates
because soybean hilum tissue is extremely small and difficult to accurately dissect from seeds in non-pigmented stages, we utilized a large seeded soybean line with brown seed coats  and a large seeded line with black seed coats  to examine mrna expression. in order to assess whether a subset of these four tandem genes were pseudogenes and/or expressed in seed coat tissue , we utilized qrt-pcr. only one of these candidate r2r <dig> myb genes, glyma09g <dig>  was expressed in any of the tissues examined . gene transcripts from glyma09g <dig> were present in the seed coats of both a brown seeded and a black seeded cultivar. however, this gene was not expressed in either cotyledon tissue  or in leaves . it is not clear if the other three r2r <dig> myb genes in the cluster are expressed in other tissues. nor is the role these genes play in soybean physiology known, if any.

curiously, the williams  <dig> glyma09g <dig> gene model was predicted to possess four exons, in contrast to the canonical  <dig> exons identified for authentic r2r <dig> myb transcription factor genes  <cit> . to characterize the authentic expressed sequence, rt-pcr was used to analyze full length cdna for comparison to the reference williams  <dig> gene model. the authentic gene is slightly larger than that the predicted glyma09g <dig> gene model and possesses three exons , in concordance with that reported for other r2r <dig> myb genes  <cit> .

analysis of glyma09g <dig> for potential causative polymorphisms
pcr and sanger sequencing of exons  was used to evaluate the glyma09g <dig> gene for polymorphisms in a selection of lines: jake , pi  <dig> , williams  <dig> , pi  <dig>  and pi  <dig> b . we discovered a single-base deletion within exon  <dig> in pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> b that results in a frameshift mutation  . the open reading frame for glyma09g <dig> was allelic between williams  <dig>  jake and pi  <dig> 

we then elected to examine a broad geographic distribution of lines  from the available soybean germplasm corresponding to all of the known seed coat and hilum color classes. from this pool, we identified three additional presumed loss of function mutations: g343-, resulting in frameshift; g95c tgg > tcg  missense in conserved residue; aggt > agtt  disrupts conserved mrna splice recognition site .

in all cases where we observed an intact open reading frame, we noted the phenotype of imperfect black hilum , buff hilum , black hilum  or black seed coat , dependent on the allelic status of the inhibitor and tawny loci . any of these four loss of function alleles resulted in either brown hilum , brown seed coat  or buff hila . in all cases, we observed a perfect association between the presence of one of the four loss of function alleles and brown hilum or brown seed coats, barring the presence of the epistatic dominant i allele or gray pubescence, both of which can mask the effect of the r allele, resulting in yellow or buff hila . these epistatic interactions  are due to the placement of the step affected by the r2r <dig> myb gene at the terminal end of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway . any one of the loss of function mutations affecting the r gene are necessary and sufficient for brown seed coat and/or hilum coloration. however, the phenotypic effect can be masked or modulated by the presence of certain alleles of the inhibitor and tawny loci .

time-course of mrna expression for glyma09g <dig> and two phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes
if the candidate r gene is controlling expression of a gene which forms a rate limited step in anthocyanin production, we hypothesized that a correlation would exist between 1) r gene expression levels, 2) the appearance of color compounds, and 3) the expression of ans and/or uf3gt genes in developing seed coats. we examined a time course of seed coat and seed cotyledons by qrt-pcr  for expression of three genes: the r gene candidate, ans, and uf3gt. seed coats from the large seeded line with brown seed coats  and one with black seed coats  were investigated for quantitation of steady state transcripts. we selected four time-points corresponding to the development of pigmentation during seed growth and maturation for pi  <dig>  and pi  <dig> b  .

although there are apparently two uf3gt genes expressed in seed coats in soybean , only one of these genes  is not expressed in cotyledon tissue  <cit> . we elected to focus on this gene for qrt-pcr, as we noted a virtual absence of ans or r gene expression in cotyledons .

we observed a near-perfect coefficient of correlation  between the level of expression  of the putative r gene and a uf3gt gene  . in contrast, we observed a weak correlation between expression of the r gene and ans gene expression  in the black seed coat line . in the brown seeded line pi  <dig> b, no significant correlation was found between r gene expression levels and either ans or uf3gt expression levels . during early and mid-development stages r gene expression is similar in both black and brown seed coat lines, though r gene expression declined during the last stages of development of the brown seeded line, in contrast to the high expression noted for the black seed coat lines . in striking contrast to the increase in expression of ans and uf3gt during seed coat maturation of the black seed coat line, only negligible ans and uf3gt expression was observed in the brown seed coat line as seeds approached maturity .

these findings confirmed our hypothesis that loss of function mutations within glyma09g <dig>  an r2r <dig> myb gene, are correlated with reduced expression of a uf3gt gene and ans genes and with the brown hilum/seed coat phenotype. it remains to future work to determine the specific dna sequence targeted by the soybean r2r <dig> myb r gene product and its specific interactions in complexes with basic-helix-loop-helix  transcription factors and wd <dig> proteins. it is unclear if the r gene product acts to promote transcriptional activation of both ans and uf3gt genes, or if activation of ans gene expression is due to an indirect effect.

discussion
understanding the genetic factors controlling the accumulation of different colored, easily categorized exterior pigments  became one of earliest models for the confirmation and expansion of mendel's laws of inheritance. indeed, modern genetics owes a strong debt to the white color trait in pea, which was exploited by mendel in the original determination of basic genetic theory  <cit> . the specific genetic cause of the white flower phenotype in pea has been ascertained as a point mutation disrupting a splice site within a bhlh transcription factor  <cit> . the study of variation in seed coat colors in many plant species has continued to be an area of active research for nearly a century. over time, a mechanistic understanding of the enzymes responsible for the individual steps involved in pigment formation, the chemistry of the pigments, and also the regulation of those enzymes and pathways by coordinated interaction of transcriptional activators have largely been resolved.

one of the characteristic features of the accumulation of plant pigments that has emerged is the regulation of critical structural genes by r2r <dig> myb transcription factors in complexes with bhlh transcription factors and wd <dig> proteins  <cit> . r2r <dig> myb genes tend to display limited homology , and the code by which r2r <dig> myb genes bind to specific sequences has not been well elucidated  <cit> . these difficulties can complicate phylogenetic analysis and the assignment of genes to paralogous functions. nevertheless, the soybean r gene candidate glyma09g <dig> shows homology to r2r <dig> myb genes . in the past few years a plethora of r2r <dig> genes have been found which directly impact expression of uf3gt and/or phenylpropanoid pathway derived color compound accumulation in seed coats  <cit> , fruits  <cit> , flowers  <cit>  and other tissues  <cit> . aside from the aesthetic appeal of colored compounds, many of these color compounds may have roles as nutraceuticals  <cit> . loss of function mutations within r2r <dig> genes have also been discerned as causative for loss of anthocyanin accumulation in other plant species  <cit> . although an r2r <dig> myb gene would be logical a priori candidates for the underlying basis of the r locus, the low level of overall homology among r2r <dig> myb genes, the presence of at least  <dig> myb genes within the soybean genome  <cit>  and the relatively poorly defined genetic map location for the r locus  <cit>  precluded candidate gene analysis prior to our fine-mapping effort.

here we used genetic mapping and candidate gene association in a ril population and a panel of soybean lines with defined coloration  to determine the r gene controlling black or brown seed coat in soybean is the r2r <dig> myb gene glyma09g <dig>  indirect evidence supports a model in which a functional r gene acts to promote transcription of the anthocyanidin late pathway structural genes u3fgt as well as ans. these results are consistent with many other instances of a transcriptional regulatory activation control point for genes in the anthocyanidin pathway  <cit> .

all of the glycine soja accessions in the usda germplasm collection have black seed coats and thus functional versions of the r gene, while glycine max has both functional and mutant alleles of the r gene. three null alleles of the r gene and one allele with a presumed severely deleterious missense mutation were present in our survey of a subset of the soybean germplasm, all of which are correlated with brown hilum or seed coat colors in our survey. of the lines containing a mutant r gene, the three null alleles had frequencies of ~53%, ~21%, and ~19%, while the missense mutation allele had a frequency of ~6% in our limited survey of  <dig> divergent lines. this result suggests that multiple independent occurrences of natural mutations from r to r were selected after soybean domestication but prior to full dispersion of the crop across asia, since no clear geographical association can be made for any particular allele. the absence of selection pressure for seed coat or hilum color may have allowed broad dispersal of the different alleles. the recently discovered gene for the determinate growth habit in soybean, dt <dig>  is an ortholog of the arabidopsis terminal flower  <dig> gene  <cit> . coincidentally, the dt <dig> gene also has an identified functional allele as well as four mutant alleles associated with a determinate growth phenotype. the mutant dt <dig> alleles are present only in glycine max, but these alleles appear to have been undergoing selection pressure at early stages of soybean landrace radiation  <cit> .

future work may involve targeted overexpression of r2r <dig> myb gene in various cotyledon, seed coat and other tissues in soybean. because the r gene appears to be exquisitely limited in expression to seed coats, overexpression of this gene in other tissues may result in accumulation of anthocyanins in tissues which lack visible pigments, such as seed cotyledons. potentially, expressing this r2r <dig> myb gene under control of a seed storage protein promoter could increase the anthocyanin content of soybean seeds, in contrast to the wild type restriction of anthocyanins to seed coats. though hypothetical, this may represent a viable, alternate means to visually select for transgene integration and/or a visual means to assist in containment of transgenic lines.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed bulk segregant analysis   <cit>  on a f6-ril population which had segregated for hilum color  <cit> , derived from a cross between a commercial cultivar with black hila  and a plant introduction line with brown hila . we utilized a novel set of bioinformatically derived ssr markers  <cit>  to fine map the r gene to less than  <dig> kilobasepairs, despite using a ril population of less than  <dig> individual f <dig> lines. analysis of the williams  <dig> whole genome shotgun sequence  <cit>  corresponding to this region revealed four tandem r2r <dig> myb genes as likely candidates for the authentic r gene. r2r <dig> myb transcription factors are one of the largest transcription factor families in plants  <cit> , and specific r2r <dig> genes have been identified in a number of species which activate phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes  <cit> . only one of the four candidate r2r <dig> myb transcription factor genes  in the genomic region containing r proved to be expressed in any of the tissues we examined. the seed-coat specific expression of the functional version of this gene was strongly correlated with the level of expression of a uf3gt gene , which encodes a gene product that carries out the final step in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . we discovered an allelic series of loss of function mutations affecting our r2r <dig> gene candidate, and the presence of any of the four loss of function mutations was perfectly correlated with the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype in a broad distribution of soybean cultivars divergent in seed coat, hilum and flower color. these findings strongly suggest that loss of function for this particular r2r <dig> myb gene is responsible for the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype in soybean. the presence of multiple independent alleles suggests that this gene was selected during domestication either directly for brown coloration or indirectly for pale hilum colors .
