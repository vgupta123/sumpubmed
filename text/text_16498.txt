BACKGROUND
the compound eyes of insects exhibit extensive variation in their size and shape, physiology and biochemical ability to detect different wavelengths of light  <cit> . these differences in vision have allowed insects to adapt to a variety of environments and adopt a wide range of life history strategies  <cit> . compound eye structure is best understood in the model drosophila melanogaster. lab strains of d. melanogaster generally have between  <dig> and  <dig> ommatidia in each eye  <cit> . however, there is variation in eye size among strains of d. melanogaster and among drosophila species due to differences in the size and number of ommatidia  <cit> .

each ommatidium consists of a cluster of eight light sensitive photoreceptor  cells  and associated cone and pigment cells  <cit> . the six outer prs  surround the inner two prs  with r <dig> located closest to the outer surface of the eye, on top of r <dig> . the pr cells have extensively folded membranes, the rhabdomeres, which contain the rhodopsin proteins  <cit> . at least five known ommatidium types can be distinguished based on their expression of specific combinations of rhodopsin proteins that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light . all outer prs in every ommatidium express the broad-range rhodopsin  <dig>  that enables motion detection, facilitates vision in dim light, and contributes to colour vision  <cit> . the inner prs enable colour vision and the detection of polarized light  <cit>  . the expression of different rhodopsins in these cells determines the various ommatidium types . in d. melanogaster, the ‘yellow’  type makes up  <dig> to 70% of all ommatidia, and can detect longer wavelengths by expressing the uv-sensitive rhodopsin  <dig>  in r <dig> and the green-sensitive rhodopsin  <dig>  in r <dig>  <cit>  . the second-most abundant type is the ‘pale’  ommatidia, which account for approximately  <dig> to 40% of all ommatidia, and express the uv-sensitive rhodopsin  <dig>  in r <dig> and the blue-sensitive rhodopsin  <dig>  in r <dig>  enabling these ommatidia to discriminate among short wavelengths of light  <cit>  . in d. melanogaster, the p and y ommatidia are distributed randomly as a consequence of the stochastic expression of underlying regulatory factors  <cit> .figure  <dig>

two additional types of ommatidia are found in the dorsal region of the eye. at the dorsal rim, a small group of highly specialised dorsal rim area  ommatidia, express rh <dig> in both r <dig> and r <dig> to enable sensitivity to linearly polarized uv light  <cit>  . more broadly distributed in the dorsal half of the eye, the so-called dorsal-yellow  ommatidia co-express both rh <dig> and rh <dig> in r <dig> , and are estimated to represent approximately 10% of all ommatidia  <cit> . a fifth type of ommatidia observed in d. melanogaster, which account for approximately 6% of all ommatidia, have been described as ‘odd-coupled’  because they express rh <dig> in r <dig>  but rh <dig> in r <dig>    <cit> .

although the specification and regionalisation of ommatidia in the compound eyes of d. melanogaster is understood in great detail, relatively little is known beyond this model. there is evidence that the approximate  <dig> to  <dig> percent ratio of the p to y ommatidia types is similar to that observed in the house fly musca domestica. however, this apparent conservation based on two species that last shared a common ancestor approximately  <dig> mya could be convergent and may belie lineage specific changes and intra-specific variation in this ratio  <cit> . indeed, we previously reported some evidence for variation in rhodopsin gene expression among species of the d. melanogaster complex  <cit> , but any association between the frequency and pattern of ommatidium types, rhodopsin mrna levels, and eye size remain to be determined.

here we report our characterisation of the expression and spatial distribution of rhodopsin proteins and the abundance of rhodopsin gene transcripts in the eyes of both sexes of different strains of d. melanogaster, d. simulans and d. mauritiana. additionally, we show how this relates to differences in ommatidia number among these species  <cit> . we found extensive differences between sexes, strains and species in the retinal mosaic of drosophila. these patterns of natural variation can serve as a basis to better understand the development, function and evolution of insect eyes  <cit> .

RESULTS
natural variation in the frequency of ommatidium types
to explore the extent of natural variation in the frequency of ommatidium types among drosophila retinas, we used immunohistochemistry with available antibodies to quantify the number of rh4-expressing ommatidia compared to rh3-expressing ommatidia in entire retinas of d. melanogaster, d. simulans and d. mauritiana. this approach allowed us to distinguish between y ommatidia , which express rh <dig> in r <dig>  p and oc ommatidia, which exclusively express rh <dig> in r <dig>  dra ommatidia, which express rh <dig> in both r <dig> and r <dig> , and to count the total number of ommatidia.

as expected, we found that the retinas of males of the d. melanogaster lab strain oregon-r were composed of approximately 70% y ommatidia and 30% p + oc ommatidia . surprisingly, however, the retinas of d. melanogaster oregon-r females had fewer y ommatidia  and more p + oc ommatidia compared to males  . to test whether the ommatidia type frequencies observed in d. melanogaster oregon-r are representative of other d. melanogaster strains, we then also scored the number of rh <dig> and rh3-expressing ommatidia in d. melanogaster zi <dig>  which is an isofemale line that was recently collected from the ancestral range of this species in africa. we found that d. melanogaster zi <dig> had a similar, albeit slightly higher proportion of p + oc ommatidia compared to d. melanogaster oregon-r, and furthermore, that this strain was also sexually dimorphic with females having a higher proportion of p + oc ommatidia than a male specimen  .figure  <dig>

we then characterised the composition of the retinal mosaic in d. simulans zom <dig> and d. mauritiana tam <dig>  since these species have been previously shown to differ in eye size, morphology and ommatidium number from d. melanogaster  <cit> . interestingly, these two species also exhibited a sexual dimorphism consistent with that observed with d. melanogaster . moreover, the proportion of p + oc ommatidia observed for d. simulans zom <dig> females  and males  was higher than for any other strain that we studied .

to test for the effects of sex and strain on the proportion of p + oc ommatidia, we constructed a linear fixed effects model that allowed for both additive and interactive effects of these two factors on the observed proportions of ommatidium types among all the retinas that we characterised. this model showed that, overall, males have a significantly lower proportion of p + oc ommatidia than females , f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> e−06). in addition, we found that the factor strain also had a significant effect in this model  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) mainly as a consequence of including d. simulans zom <dig>  however, despite the high male d. simulans zom <dig> values, the interaction between strain and sex was not significant  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ), indicating that this effect is consistent across all strains.

variation in total ommatidium number between sexes, strains and species
consistent with our previous findings  <cit> , in this dataset, the total number of ommatidia per retina also differed significantly between strains  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> e−08) . for females, d. mauritiana tam <dig> and d. melanogaster oregon-r had the highest  and lowest  number of ommatidia respectively. males had significantly fewer ommatidia than females , f =  <dig> , p = <dig> e−05), and this dimorphism was most pronounced in d. melanogaster zi <dig>  and least pronounced in d. mauritiana tam <dig> .

it follows from these results that the proportion of p + oc ommatidia and the total number of ommatidia appear to be positively correlated   = <dig> , p = <dig> ). however, there are clearly outliers suggesting that the overall correlation we have found between p + oc and total number of ommatidia may mask sex and strain specific effects. for example, d. mauritiana tam <dig> males do not appear to conform to this pattern.

surprisingly, in contrast to the variation observed in the proportion of p + oc ommatidia, the number of dra ommatidia varied very little  among all of the retinas examined and was not correlated with species, strain or sex  = <dig> , p = <dig> ) or the total number of ommatidia .

spatial distribution of ommatidium types over the retina
retinal mosaic maps  showed that, as expected, all dra ommatidia are located at the dorsal rim of all retinas, with the odd exception where a few dra ommatidia were found in the ventral eye . however, although p + oc and y ommatidia are thought to be distributed stochastically  <cit> , we observed local clustering of p + oc and y ommatidium types in distinct areas of some retinas. in particular, d. simulans zom <dig> showed a high incidence or patch of rh <dig> expressing ommatidia in the dorsal-posterior region of the retinas of both sexes .figure  <dig> 
variation in the density of p + oc ommatidia over the retina. a. representative retinal mosaic maps of one female eye for each of four surveyed strains. red dots indicate p + oc ommatidia, yellow dots y ommatidia, black dots dra and grey dots ommatidia of unknown type. black horizontal stripes indicate the observed equator in the center of the retina, grey horizontal strips the equator extrapolated towards the periphery. vertical grey dashed lines indicate the center-most dorsal ventral row. b. kernel smoothed density estimates of p + oc ommatidia, and conversely of y ommatidia, in retinal mosaic maps representing both sexes of three drosophila species. scale bar density values are arbitrary  but linear, indicating a seven-fold difference in p + oc density between either end of the scale. numbers in both a and b refer to the id of individual retinas. retinas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are depicted in both a and b.



to visualise patterns of ommatidium type distribution, we plotted for all retinal mosaic maps the kernel smoothed estimate of the local density of p + oc ommatidia  . this procedure not only highlighted the accentuated cluster of rh <dig> expressing ommatidia in the dorsal-posterior of d. simulans zom <dig> retinas, but also revealed more subtle variation in spatial density among other retinas. for example, most of the retinas studied exhibited a slight elevation of p + oc density near the ventral rim of the retina . this is apparent in both female and male retinas, despite the lower overall proportion of p + oc ommatidia in males. a second pattern that emerged from this analysis was an increase in the density of the y type in the anterior retinas of males in particular . in contrast, d. mauritiana tam <dig> and d. melanogaster zi <dig> females appeared to exhibit a deficit of y ommatidia in the anterior .

we then tested for global  clustering of p + oc and/or y ommatidia, by first tallying the number of directly juxtaposed -, y-y and -y ommatidia  and then comparing these numbers with those predicted under the null hypothesis of no spatial dependence between ommatidium types . this approach confirmed that all of the d. simulans zom <dig> retinas showed spatial autocorrelation, with significantly reduced numbers of juxtaposed -y ommatidia , in combination with an increase in adjoining y-y ommatidia  and/or an increase in adjoining - ommatidia . the retinas from the other species and strains did not show global spatial autocorrelation, with the exception of d. melanogaster oregon-r  and zi <dig> , which exhibited moderate clustering of y ommatidia, but not of p + oc ommatidia.

next we tested for dorsal-ventral patterns in the enrichment of p + oc ommatidia, after partitioning each retina using the equator . the percentage of p + oc ommatidia in the dorsal did not deviate significantly from the average across the whole retina, with the exception of the d. melanogaster zi <dig> female retinas, in which the ventral region was more enriched in p + oc ommatidia than the dorsal region . in contrast, comparisons between the anterior and posterior retina halves, using the centre of the dorsal-ventral midline , showed more pronounced differences . among male and female d. simulans zom <dig> retinas the posterior half contained significantly more p + oc ommatidia than the anterior half . d. melanogaster oregon-r males showed the same trend but the difference between anterior and posterior halves was not significant. interestingly, female d. mauritiana tam <dig> retinas also showed a significantly skewed anterior-posterior distribution, but with a pattern in the opposite direction from that observed in the other strains .figure  <dig>

to further characterise the dorsal-posterior patch of rh <dig> expressing ommatidia observed in d. simulans zom <dig>  we carried out an additional immunohistochemistry assay in this strain using antibodies against rh <dig> and rh <dig> to distinguish between p and oc ommatidia. this experiment revealed that this dorsal-posterior patch found in d. simulans zom <dig> is actually a mosaic of p and oc ommatidia .

variation in rhodopsin mrna levels
our characterisation of ommatidium types based on assaying their expression of rh <dig> and/or rh <dig> using immunohistochemistry, as described above, suggests that there is extensive natural variation in the retinal mosaics of d. melanogaster, d. simulans and d. mauritiana. however, wider surveying of natural variation in the expression of rhodopsins requires higher throughput strategies. quantitative real-time pcr  is an approach that has been commonly applied to measure the relative expression of opsins in vertebrates  <cit> , and although this approach does not provide any insight into the spatial distribution of pr cells with differential rhodopsin expression, this technique could be applied to further survey natural variation in the expression of rhodopsin genes in drosophila. therefore, we expanded on our previous experiments  <cit>  and sought to determine if the differential rhodopsin protein expression we have used to score variation in the frequencies of ommatidium types is reflected in relative transcript abundance among sexes, strains and species of drosophila using qpcr .

to circumvent the challenge of defining housekeeping genes that would reliably scale with the size of the adult retina across sexes and species, we measured the relative expression of rh <dig> mrna to the expression of rh <dig> and rh <dig> combined , and the relative expression of rh <dig> mrna to the expression of rh <dig> and rh <dig> combined . since expression of rh <dig> and rh <dig>  and rh <dig> and rh <dig> distinguishes the r <dig> and r <dig> cells of p + oc and y ommatidia respectively, these expression indexes were thus used as proxies to estimate relative frequencies of ommatidium types in the same strains and species of the d. melanogaster complex used above, as well as in several additional strains.figure  <dig>

for d. melanogaster oregon-r, we found values of the rh <dig> index of  <dig> % ± <dig>  and  <dig> % ± <dig>  for males and females respectively. the values of the rh <dig> index for d. melanogaster oregon-r males and females were slightly lower at  <dig> % ± <dig>  and  <dig> % ± <dig> . however, these qpcr values were broadly consistent with the frequencies of p + oc types we found for d. melanogaster oregon-r .

we then investigated rhodopsin transcript abundance in d. melanogaster zi <dig> and an additional strain zi <dig>  these two strains had significantly higher values for the rh <dig> index  and the rh <dig> index  than d. melanogaster oregon-r . although this is consistent with the greater proportion of p + oc ommatidia in d. melanogaster zi <dig> than oregon-r based on immunohistochemistry , the relative abundance of both rh <dig>  and rh <dig>  transcripts appears to be elevated in the former strain with respect to the number of p + oc ommatidia  .

we next investigated relative transcript abundance among three strains of d. simulans  and two d. mauritiana strains  . we found that the three d. simulans strains were all significantly different from each other for both the rh <dig> index  and the rh <dig> index  . in addition, d. mauritiana mav <dig> had significantly higher rh <dig>  and rh <dig>  indexes than d. mauritiana tam <dig> .

for d. simulans zom <dig> the rh <dig> indexes  were consistent with the frequency of p + oc ommatidia , but the rh <dig> indexes  were somewhat elevated in comparison. for d. mauritiana tam <dig>  the values of both the rh <dig>  and rh <dig> indexes  were also elevated compared to the frequency of p + oc ommatidia , particularly for rh <dig> and especially in the case of males. this analysis shows that the qpcr data generally gives a similar trend to the ommatidium type frequencies measured using immunohistochemistry, especially for d. melanogaster; for the other species the transcript abundance of rh <dig> in particular appears to be elevated.

the trend in the qpcr data for most strains suggested that males and females differed for the values of rh <dig> and rh <dig> indexes consistent with dimorphism in p + oc ommatidia observed from the antibody stainings against rhodopsin proteins. to test this further we constructed a linear mixed model to compare genders and at the same time determine whether the qpcr data showed any differences between species, while treating the factor strain as a random effect . this showed that both the rh <dig> and rh <dig> indexes differed significantly between sexes, with females having higher values than males in both cases  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> e- <dig>  and x2 =  <dig> , p < <dig> e- <dig>  respectively) . while the rh <dig> index values were not significantly different in this linear mixed model for species  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), rh <dig> index values did vary significantly between species  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> )  with the d. mauritiana and d. melanogaster strains exhibiting the highest and lowest levels of p ommatidium-type associated rhodopsin mrna expression respectively.

finally, to more directly compare the qpcr results of the current study with those obtained previously  <cit> , we calculated the expression of rh <dig>  rh <dig> and rh <dig> relative to the total of these three rhodopsin mrna . in this representation, and consistent with previous results, d. melanogaster oregon-r shows the smallest relative proportion of rh <dig> mrna, whereas both d. mauritiana strains  exhibit high relative proportions . moreover, the relative proportion of rh <dig> expression in d. simulans kib <dig> is intermediate between d. mauritiana and d. melanogaster oregon-r . however, compared to our previous study, our current data also highlights the variation between strains - both within d. simulans and d. melanogaster .

discussion
the drosophila compound eye consists of a mosaic of different ommatidium types. each type expresses a different combination of rhodopsins , and is therefore sensitive to different fractions of the light spectrum. accordingly, the relative proportions and the spatial arrangement of these different types are important aspects of the vision of these flies  <cit> . the regulation and development of retinal regionalisation are well understood in d. melanogaster. in this species, specialised dra ommatidia are positioned dorsal to a mosaic of stochastically distributed p and y ommatidia. our results show, however, that there is extensive natural variation in ommatidium type frequencies and distributions, as well as in the expression of rhodopsin transcript levels among sexes, strains and species of the d. melanogaster species subgroup.

sexual dimorphism in rhodopsin expression
both our antibody staining and qpcr assays to quantify ommatidia type frequencies and distributions showed that there are differences in the expression of rhodopsins between the sexes of all three drosophila species. specifically, females express more p type associated rhodopsin mrna  than males , which is reflected in the higher proportion of p + oc ommatidium types in females compared to males . this could mean that overall the vision of male drosophila is different from that of females.

sexual dimorphism in photoreceptor fate has been described in musca, for example the evolution of rh <dig> expression in the inner photoreceptors of a subset of ommatidia in males  <cit> , which is associated with higher spatial and temporal resolution, allowing males to detect small moving objects better than females  <cit> . however, the potential functional consequences of the more subtle variation in the retinal mosaic that we have found in the case of drosophila requires further testing. an alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation is that the dimorphism observed in drosophila is a consequence of differences in ommatidium number seen between males and females, which cannot be entirely accounted for by the difference in body size between sexes  <cit> . this explanation is supported by our finding of a positive relationship between the proportion of p + oc ommatidia and total ommatidium number across species and sexes . however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this relationship, remain to be found and may differ between lineages since male d. mauritiana tam <dig> retinas do not fit the above hypothesis because they exhibit high numbers of ommatidia but a relatively low proportion of them are p + oc.

interestingly, the number of dra ommatidia varied very little, did not correlate with gender, and did not increase even in retinas with larger numbers of ommatidia in total. this suggests that there are constraints on the number of these ommatidia, possibly as a consequence of the limited range of expression of the underlying regulatory factors, such as homothorax, when this ommatidium type is defined during pupation  <cit> .

natural variation in rhodopsin expression within and among species
current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying ommatidium type specification is centred on findings that the p and y ommatidia fate is determined stochastically  <cit> . the strongest support for this hypothesis was found by characterising the arrangement of p and y ommatidia in  <dig> different d. melanogaster retinas  <cit> . however, since in this previous study only a sample of ommatidia were investigated per retina , it is not entirely clear what region of each retina was surveyed, and if males, females or both sexes were used. our data therefore builds on that of bell et al.  <cit>  by characterising the mosaic map of the whole retina of each specimen, for males and females separately. spatial analysis of complete retinal mosaic maps shows that p + oc and y ommatidia are not just uniformly spread over the eye, but that there are localized accumulations as well as regional variations in the density of these ommatidium types .

one of our most striking observations is the high overall percentage of p + oc ommatidia in d. simulans zom <dig> , which correlates with the occurrence of a patch of p + oc ommatidia types in the dorsal-posterior retina of both sexes of this strain , and a generally high density of rh <dig> expressing ommatidia in the posterior retina . however, to test if this patch is strain specific or commonly found in d. simulans requires further systematic study of multiple retinas of both sexes of a range of d. simulans strains.

thus, although our data does not refute that p and y specification is stochastic across large parts of the retina, it does provide further evidence that the stochastic p to y switch could be modulated regionally, as shown previously  <cit> . indeed, there might be other regional influences from as yet unknown factors that influence this switch and allow for the enrichment and conversely deficiency of types in different parts of the eye such as the enrichment and paucity of p + oc ommatidia in the posterior of the retinas of d. simulans zom <dig> and d. mauritiana tam <dig> respectively . one intriguing possibility is that these variations are due to differences in the expression of spineless, which represses p fate and promotes y fate  <cit> .

we found variation in ommatidium frequency and distribution among drosophila strains and species based on immunohistochemistry , supported to some extent by the trends in the relative levels of rhodopsin mrna expression . these results, which corroborate our previous findings  <cit> , suggest that there might be differences in vision among these flies. however, the visual function, behavioural consequences or even adaptive reasons for this variation remain to be tested. natural variation in opsin mrna expression has been the focus of numerous studies in cichlid fishes, and has been shown to correlate with behavioural and environmental factors such as foraging and ambient light  <cit> . on the other hand, variation in stochastic cone ratios has also been described between human individuals, but does not seem to correlate with variation in colour vision  <cit> . a range of assays for studying the effects of genetic manipulation on drosophila visual behaviour have been developed  <cit> , and could provide a starting point for behavioural studies of natural variants. the results could be particularly insightful since although the ecology of these species is rather enigmatic, at least d. melanogaster and d. simulans are world-wide distributed commensal generalists and as such have adapted to a wide range of habitats since their evolution in africa and madagascar  <cit> .

despite the promise of high-throughput data acquisition via qpcr and successful application of this technique in other organisms, our current survey of variation in rhodopsin mrna expression in drosophila highlights some issues with this approach. first, the relationship between mrna and protein expression levels is generally unclear and difficult to predict  <cit> , and would need to be studied for the particular relationship between drosophila rhodopsin transcripts and proteins before accurate inferences could be made between the two. second, even if rhodopsin protein levels could be estimated efficiently and accurately via qpcr, this does not directly translate to the relative proportions of ommatidium types that we observed because, for example, p ommatidia might not express as much rh <dig> as y ommatidia express rh <dig>  and dra, oc and dy types are likely to have a complex influence on relative rhodopsin levels.

given these challenges, it is remarkable and encouraging that our qpcr and antibody based surveys identified similar trends, showing both a significant sexual dimorphism and significant differences between strains. hence, for future studies, the two approaches could provide potentially complementary ways to study variation in vision. for example our qpcr assay could be further developed to quickly and reliably determine transcript levels in single flies, which would open up the possibility to test the genetic differences underlying variation in rhodopsin mrna expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we present here, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive survey to date of rhodopsin variation among sexes, strains and species of the d. melanogaster species subgroup. our results suggest that natural variation within and among species in as yet unknown regulatory mechanisms can alter the local distribution of ommatidium types described in the model d. melanogaster. future studies of the genetic basis of the differences in ommatidia frequencies and distributions that we have found will allow further elucidation of differences in gene regulation between sexes and evolutionary differences in cell fate within and between species.
